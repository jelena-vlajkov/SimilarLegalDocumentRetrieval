0	0	198340.json	 finally the government argue even if turner 's original consent be circumscribe he expand the authorization by fail to object to the computer file search nor be it material to the present inquiry that turner as the alleged assailant would have be familiar with the detail of the assault base on his first hand knowledge since the test be not subjective reasonableness but objective reasonableness turner who live in the apartment next door to thomas notify the bangor police thus we believe that an objective observer witness in context the pre consent exchange between turner and the investigate detective reasonably would construe evidence of the assault itself to mean physical evidence link to the crime scene rather than documentary or photographic evidence upon their arrival at the turner apartment early in the morning on july 28 the detective by their own admission do not consider turner a suspect in the thomas assault before do so he be expressly tell that the officer would search for any sign the suspect have be inside the apartment any sign a suspect have leave behind or anything of that sort and evidence of the assault itself after the defendant consent however the officer inspect personal paper 1996 when a purpose be include in the officer 's request then the consent should be construe as authorize only that intensity of police activity necessary to accomplish the state purpose we therefore look beyond the language of the consent itself to the overall context which necessarily encompass contemporaneous police statement and action similarly we can not accept the government 's contention that the sexually suggestive image which suddenly come into plain view on the computer screen render turner 's computer file fair game under a consensual search simply because the thomas assault have a sexual component e.g. the attempt to tie her hand moreover when the detective later announce their intention to search for evidence of the assault itself an objectively reasonable person likely would infer that they intend to search for evidence of the same ilk that be for incriminate object directly link to the nearby crime scene not for documentary or photographic evidence ii discussion the district court rule that even if the turner consent authorize the opening of nondescript file contain photograph it do not permit the opening of file label young or young with breast which be unlikely to contain evidence pertinent to the thomas assault the district court grant the motion follow a suppression hearing on the ground that it be not objectively reasonable for detective gould to have conclude that evidence of the thomas assault the stated object of the consent search would be find in file with such label as young or young with breast 1994 find consent invalid where interalia police officer do not notify the consenter that he be look for drug make it somewhat more difficult to impute to the consenter consent to search every container within the car that might contain drug as we conclude that the consent do not authorize the search of the computer we affirm the district court judgment when police detective arrive at the scene turner tell they that while seat upstairs at his computer he have observe the intruder flee the thomas apartment then telephone the police the objective reasonableness of this understanding become even more clear when one consider the fruitsof the consensual search which have take place just before turner sign the write consent that be the concrete physical evidence associate with the assault itself include scatter blood stain and a knife which fit the description give by the victim whereas in sharp contrast it obviously would have be impossible to abandon physical evidence of this sort in a personal computer hard drive and bizarre to suppose nor have the government suggest that the suspect intruder stop to enter incriminate evidence into the turner computer later after find a knife and scatter blood stain for which turner could provide no explanation and before turner sign the write consent form the detective tell turner that he be a suspect 2252 he move to suppress the computer file 98 1258 united states of america plaintiff appellant v. daniel turner defendant appellee at their request turner sign a write consent to search the premise his vehicle and personal property the next morning bangor police detective reagan and gould return to the crime scene for further investigation and notice that window screen on both the thomas and turner apartment be ajar and the sill on the turner apartment be smear with blood see e.g. united states v. elliott 107 f.3d 810 815 10th cir see e.g. united states v. mcrae 81 f.3d 1528 1538 10th cir thereafter the district court suppress the photograph and the government bring this interlocutory appeal then while remove box from the closet and stack they on or near the computer station gould notice that turner 's computer monitor screen suddenly turn on and the windows desktop disclose a photograph of a nude woman with light color hair which gould conclude be similar to ms. thomas hair color base on description gould have be give 1996 defendant be present during the search she could and should have protest at the time if she believe the police exceed the scope of her consent as it be her burden to limit that scope since it come within an established exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement a consensual search may not exceed the scope of the consent give turner accompany the detective on their initial tour of his apartment during which they find additional blood stain on the stairway wall lead to the second floor and on a trash can lid in the computer room on the second floor may be consider an indication that the search be within the scope of the consent the critical consideration in this regard be that the detective never announce before turner give his consent that they be investigate a sexual assault or attempt rape the detective awaken turner tell he about these discovery and express their concern that the intruder might have enter turner 's apartment as well the detective nevertheless couch their search request in term normally understand to refer only to an intruder rather than a permanent resident by announce their intention to look for any sign the suspect have be inside the apartment and any sign a suspect have leave behind at that point gould seat himself at the computer and engage the mouse to access the document index from the windows 95 task bar which itemize title of file most recently access by turner thus assume arguendo that such computer image could be consider circumstantial evidence of a plan sexual assault an objectively reasonable person assess the actual exchange between the detective and turner would not have understand that such image be within the express object of the intend search for evidence of an aggravate assault rather after find a window screen ajar in the turner apartment they suspect that thomas 's assailant might have break into the turner apartment while flee the crime scene next door something which turner presumably need not have do to gain access to his own apartment we emphasize nonetheless that our decision be predicate upon the particular fact of this case and in no sense represent a per se rule on computer search the detective then begin to suspect that turner be the assailant 1997 where officer explain to the person whose consent be be seek that he just want to see how thing be pack or package w]e conclude that a typical reasonable person would have construe these additional statement as expressly limit the scope of the officer 's request 3 wayne r. lafave search and seizure 8.1(c at 620 3d ed furthermore aggravate assault be neither akin to so- call paper trail crime like bank or mail fraud nor to possession of child pornography wherein the suspect might be expect to retain evidence of the offense itself among personal paper or in a computer hard drive the intruder flee florida v. jimeno 500 u.s. 248 251 1991 united states v. donlin 982 f.2d 31 33 1st cir thus turner have no meaningful opportunity to object before the computer search be complete in the present case the detective preliminarily restrict the scope of the consent in several respect deny 119 s.

1	1	198341.json	 5861(d 5871 2 be a felon in know possession of the shotgun the revolver or the ammunition see 18 u.s.c. factual finding regard the possession of firearm in order to invoke the guideline associate with armed career criminal the district court find by a preponderance of the evidence that ellis knowingly possess the handgun ammunition and two other uncharged weapon the handgun as oppose to the shotgun be well maintain ellis seek to testify that on the basis of this failure to get back to he he reasonably conclude that the possession of the ammunition be legal notwithstanding his status as a convict felon accord to ellis this alleged error become critical at sentencing when the district court do not have the jury 's guidance on which if any of the charge item it have find ellis knowingly possess such a form would have enable the district court to determine which if any of the firearm and ammunition the jury find ellis to have knowingly possess he seek to introduce evidence that in 1991 during a prior search of his property by agent of the maine bureau of intergovernmental drug enforcement bide ellis a prior convict felon have inquire about the legality of the ammunition he then possess in the absence of any explicit finding by the district court to support the government 's position however and in light of the fact that at sentence the government specifically decline to provide any evidence with regard to the additional uncharged weapon we vacate ellis 's sentence and remand for resentence consistent with this opinion on the basis of prior conviction date from 1975 1983 and on its finding regard the weapon the district court increase the base offense level pursuant to the sentencing guideline provision associate with be an armed career criminal see u.s.s.g. 1994 defendant who contest the issue of intent at trial and only express remorse after trial be not eligible for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility nonetheless the district court should determine the matter in the first instance or at least clarify its prior reasoning for deny the reduction if it have occasion to address the issue on resentence in these circumstance the district court be not bind by the jury 's conclusion even if they be knowable with the certainty ellis ascribe to they his sentence be vacate and the case remand to the district court for resentence however if the possession have the potential to aid or facilitate the other crime that be sufficient the sentencing transcript suggest that it be possible the district court believe that because ellis 's trial issue be not relate to jurisdiction or constitutionality the latter of which be an example offer in application note 2 ellis be not eligible for the reduction finally even if we be to treat the district court 's failure to consider the shotgun as an implicit finding that ellis do not knowingly possess it a decision to treat the shotgun and the handgun differently be amply support by the evidence also at trial ellis request that a special verdict form be use in count ii in order to determine which item shotgun revolver or ammunition if any the jury agree that he have knowingly possess in deny the request the district court express worry that such a form would encourage the jury to return with a compromise verdict a. ellis have not explain how know precisely what the jury find beyond a reasonable doubt would have aid his cause before the district court at sentencing where a low burden of proof apply see mcmillan v. pennsylvania 477 u.s. 79 91 1986 see e.g. u.s.s.g. we affirm ellis 's conviction but vacate the sentence and remand to the district court for resentence his acceptance purportedly consist of his counsel 's admission of ellis 's guilt on the marijuana charge in open argument his own testimony to the same effect and the fact that he challenge only the intent element of the firearm charge at sentencing the court explicitly find that ellis have knowingly possess the revolver as well as the uncharged weapon the third point be particularly unpersuasive on the fact before we where the total amount of marijuana recover from the cultivation operation thirty six and one half gram be worth approximately $ 160 use the government 's estimate .0365 g x 2.2 lbs./kg x $ 2000 lb c. in connection with we review the district court 's application of a particular sentencing guideline de novo see united states v. thompson 32 f.3d 1 4 1st cir in its brief the government point to the follow evidence as support the district court 's conclusion that there be sufficient evidence to find such a nexus 1 the fact that 80 of drug crime in maine also involve firearm violation 2 the fact that ellis cultivate his crop hide from plain view 3 the fact that marijuana be worth $ 2,000 per pound on the street second we point out that the district court make no finding at all regard the shotgun rather the court simply decline to consider it obviously in such circumstance there be no plain error in refuse to instruct the jury on the defense we review for plain error a district court 's failure to instruct the jury on a defense where the instruction be not the subject of a proper objection at trial here the district court use the 34 base level and category vi apparently because it find the requisite connection the government do not oppose the request but the district court nevertheless deny it combine with the fact that the charge gun and random ammunition be both inaccessible and nowhere near the marijuana allege to be protect by they the three item of evidence to which the government allude in its appellate brief be not sufficient for we to affirm the district court 's implicit finding of a connection the district court decline to award the reduction in regard to the third item the government 's recitation of the street value of marijuana add nothing to the analysis again drug have significant value on the street even when the firearm possession be merely coincidental to the drug operation the first item have nothing to do with ellis and in any event would always apply whether possession be coincidental or not in derogation of thompson because the district court find only know possession of the handgun ellis invite this court to find clear error ellis 's evidence consist of testimony that in 1991 during a search of his property by bide he inquire about the legality of the ammunition he possess for this reason he argue that the district court err in use u.s.s.g. 1969 and follow the ninth circuit 's lead see reed 147 f.3d at 1180 we adopt this standard entrapment by estoppel require ellis to establish 1 that a government official tell he the act be legal 2 that he rely on the advice 3 that the reliance be reasonable and 4 that give the reliance prosecution would be unfair if not the applicable level be 33 although both the shotgun and the handgun be recover from the bureau the shotgun be dusty while the handgun be clean 1995 i]ntent like any other element of the crime charge may not be contest by the defendant without jeopardize a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility first ellis claim the district court err by exclude evidence of the 1991 search and by refuse to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment by estoppel first the court need not have make any finding regard the handgun the district court do not however make any explicit finding on this issue the shotgun be old while the handgun be new they be under a bureau in a small room in which by the government 's own admission it be difficult to shift furniture

administrative record view in its entirety must compel the conclusion that he be asylum eligible moreover the sister 's testimony be rank hearsay she herself have not be in el salvador for over a decade and the source of the letter writer knowledge be obscure in 1982 the government encourage formation of local group which come to be call the civil defense patrol cdp to defend against the guerrilla specifically he assert that the ij cros examine he interrupt his testimony and suggest line of inquiry to the ins 's attorney these and other inconsistency such as the petitioner 's admit purchase of fraudulent documentation on an early occasion the factual variance between the petitioner 's second and third asylum application and his change story about when he first enter the united states see supra note 1 couple with the absence of plausible explanation for the incongruity amply justify the ij 's conclusion that the petitioner 's testimony lack credibility on the petitioner 's version when the fmln attempt to recruit he in 1980 he never divulge his political leaning and the guerrilla express no awareness of they even if we assume for argument 's sake that the act allege here could fall into the elusive realm of persecution the record support the ij 's multi pronged finding that the petitioner 's credibility be impair and that his evidence to the extent credible at all lack the specificity require to establish the requisite nexus between the allege act and one of the five statutorily protect ground while the ij might have draw an inference that the fmln target the petitioner because of his membership in a social group i.e. his family she choose to draw a contrary equally plausible inference as to the former the ij plausibly suggest that give the substantial land holding of the petitioner 's family such threat if receive at all could just as easily have represent attempt by the guerrilla to garner financial support for their movement 1998 the law require at least some showing that the allege persecutor be not subject to the government 's control see llana castellon v. ins 16 f.3d 1093 1097 98 10th cir the petitioner concede deportability but request political asylum and withholding of deportation or in the alternative voluntary departure in support of his claim of past persecution the petitioner testify to the following at that point the petitioner flee the country second the political party with which the petitioner allege affiliation arena convincingly prevail in the 1994 national election and remain in control of the government during the petitioner 's nuptial stay friend and family allegedly inform he that member of a guerilla organization the fmln be make inquiry a judge who play an active but even handed role in keep the focus of the inquiry sharp be to be commend not condemn in short while the petitioner 's and his old brother 's political opinion may have play a part in these untoward incident the record do not mandate a finding to that effect the petitioner seek review argue that the ij 's conduct at the hearing violate his right to due process and that the evidence mandate a grant of asylum the petitioner 's father 's participation in and personal support for arena a political party in ideological opposition to the fmln do not trip the balance at the conclusion of the hearing the immigration judge ij issue an adverse bench decision he claim that the hearing officer 's heavy handedness abridge his right to due process that the bia 's rejection of his application lack record support and that congress 's enactment of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of 1997 nacara pub the petitioner introduce no evidence about the motivation behind these attack and without some proof that the guerrilla be attempt to harm or oppress the townspeople on account of their political opinion the record can not conceivably compel a conclusion that enlistment in the cdp subject its member to politically inspire persecution the petitioner 's self- proclaim nemesis the fmln metamorphose into a legitimate political party at that time a fortiori the record do not compel a conclusion that the guerrilla persecute the petitioner because of his family status with respect to post peace accord evidence the petitioner hawk six loosely relate item i conclusory testimony elicit from his sister a united states resident since 1988 to the effect that peril await he in el salvador and ii a compendium of five letter send to he by person still live in el salvador concerned about their safety the petitioner 's family temporarily move to the capital san salvador this be especially important because the record contain no evidence subsequent to the 1980 incident of any harassment that be even arguably link to the petitioner 's political view we recognize of course that t]he testimony of the applicant if credible may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration despite this lack of personal involvement the petitioner contend that the fmln target he and his family even after his father 's death for special attention during the early 1980s the petitioner 's family receive numerous threat from unspecified source but these also come to naught she also point out that the circumstance surround the purchase belie the petitioner 's story he obtain the card through a brazilian intermediary whose last name he profess not to recall never step foot in a government office pay $ 3,000 in cash for the document and travel from boston to miami to procure it his membership in a series of political party most notably the arena party place he on the opposite end of the political spectrum from the fmln the short of it be that the ij conduct the proceeding in this case in a balanced thoroughly professional manner by like token the ij 's cross examination be wholly consistent with the requirement of the immigration and nationality act the act analysis we address in sequence the petitioner 's claim that the bia err i in its condonation of the ij 's conduct and ii in its denial of his asylum claim during this nomadic period the family home in chalatenango be destroy although the record contain no clear indication as to when how why or by whom the ij conclude that the petitioner fail to establish either past persecution or a well found fear of future persecution on account of one of the five enumerate ground and the bia concur we have review these material and find they inconsequential neither the testimony nor the correspondence contain specific as to the nature of any danger the identity of any potential malefactor or the reason why people might wish to harm the petitioner to the extent that the petitioner 's testimony about what have occur in the 1980 1985 time frame could be credit the ij supportably find that it lack the requisite degree of specificity to sustain the petitioner 's burden of proof accord to the petitioner the cdp engage the guerrilla in several armed confrontation between 1982 and 1984 at which time the guerrilla seize firm control of the region and the cdp disband view against this backdrop the ij 's determination that the petitioner fail to show a well found fear of future persecution pass muster before we the petitioner do not press for voluntary departure but rather seek political asylum and withholding of deportation where as here the constellation of fact and circumstance allege by an asylum applicant together with the other record evidence support two or more compete inference the ij 's choice among those inference can not be deem erroneous some four year later the immigration and naturalization service ins apprehend the petitioner and begin proceeding to deport he on the ground that he have enter the united states illegally in particular the vague evidence of allege persecution that the petitioner adduce fail to establish a sufficient nexus between the event that he describe and any ground enumerate in 8 u.s.c. to sum up the ij find that the petitioner 's meager basis for fear of future persecution fail to refute the overwhelming record evidence of change country condition john r. gibson of the eighth circuit sit by designation
3	3	198343.json	 yet the high maximum set by the guideline be because the robbery result in a murder and brady through his refusal to testify seek to obstruct this investigation in part this result from the promiscuous use in the case of the ambiguous word intent which can mean either knowledge of consequence or purpose to achieve they see model penal code 2.02 amp explanatory note official draft 1962 in part it result from the great range of vary motive that can underlie a refusal to testify e.g. loyalty of various kind concern as to reputation fear of reprisal concern about self- incrimination the issue and this case would be very easy if one accept the view advance in the government 's brief that it be sufficient for the contemnor to know i.e. be aware that silence will in fact obstruct 2j1.2 the obstruction of justice guideline this may be nothing more than the version supply by the government 's lawyer but where accept by the probation officer it be sufficient unless rebut seegonzalez vazquez 34 f.3d at 25 and brady do not seek to rebut the raw fact although he do and do challenge the inference to be draw the presentence report which judge young adopt recommend that brady be sentence under the sentencing guideline that apply to obstruction of justice u.s.s.g. where the contempt be a refusal to testify before a grand jury court have resort to several different guideline as analogy include the obstruction guideline the misprision guideline and the guideline govern the refusal of a material witness to appear 15 when brady later appear at the fbi to provide print he make reference to the incident under investigation state i 've always be partial to the bonneville or word to that effect 1503 which be cross reference by the guideline u.s.s.g. 2x3.1 which increase the offense level up to a maximum of 30 base on the underlying criminal conduct here a robbery and murder here we think it be a fair inference that brady possess some information that could assist the grand jury this be suggest by his association on the night of the minivan robbery with two friend who steal the van use in the robbery and by brady 's refusal to testify which give the immunity order and absent a showing of actual fear suggest that he know something useful in the course of sentencing judge young find that brady have be involve with brennan and hansen that he know of their plan and that brady 's theft of the bonneville be in some way relate to the robbery the agent advise brady that the information be be request in connection with the investigation of the july 31 1996 armored car robbery and murder and of brady 's possible involvement in the incident during the course of this robbery one of the robber intentionally shoot and kill at point blank range one of the armored car guard edward kubera this be suggest by the fact that brady be friend with the other two that they apparently travel together to the same area in the north end for the theft and that brady have some kind of further knowledge that make he reluctant to testify to the grand jury statutory provision and we see nothing to rebut the presumption accordingly he employ the offense level set forth in the accessory after the fact guideline u.s.s.g. 14 on august 23 1996 agent of the fbi issue a grand jury subpoena request that brady appear to provide fingerprint and photographing he in fact have knowledge of their plan and that the stealing of the bonneville be in some way relate to the general plan for which the minivan the minivan sic be steal instead the commission in section 2j1.1 direct the court by cross reference to apply the most analogous offense guideline u.s.s.g. however we think it be ordinarily sufficient to satisfy the corruptly requirement in the statute without regard to other circumstance that might also establish corruption e.g. offer a bribe)--if the contemnor 's purpose for refuse to testify be to prevent the grand jury from locate the criminal here the district court choose as the analogy the obstruction of justice guideline 13 on july 31 1996 the minivan steal by brennan and hansen be in fact use by three mask man to rob a dunbar armored car at the twin city plaza in somerville ma without endorse the topology offer in the opinion we agree completely with ryan that even where the conduct be as here narrow to a contemptuous refusal to testify to a grand jury the choice of the good analogy depend upon the circumstance 2j1.2 comment in march 1997 brady be summon before the federal grand jury investigate the robbery and he take the fifth amendment subsequently brady be make the subject of an immunity order compel he to testify and provide that information he give could not be use against he in the fall of 1996 brady be photograph and fingerprint as part of the fbi 's investigation of the robbery in connection with this investigation brady make statement more or less admitting that he have steal the bonneville the district court finding that brady be friend with the minivan thief and somehow involve in the plot make it highly likely and certainly more likely than not that his refusal to testify be significantly motivate by a desire to frustrate the investigation of the robbery and thereby protect his friend however neither obstruction nor an endeavor to obstruct normally violate the statute unless there be a corrupt purpose and this bring we to the single most difficult legal issue in the case the paragraph be as follow 12 on an evening in late july of 1996 robert brady and two of his closet sic friend brendan brennan and paul james hansen go from their home neighborhood in the charlestown section of boston to the north end neighborhood of boston for the purpose of steal car on two different occasion both before and after the plea brady express a willingness to testify if different condition be meet one condition that no prior interview or proffer be require be agree to but the other a promise that brady would not be prosecute for perjury if he lie be naturally reject follow the robbery and murder the robber make their escape in the steal minivan 1998 uphold use of the obstruction guideline in somewhat similar circumstance in the course of the robbery one of the robber deliberately shoot and kill one of the guard the obstruction guideline provide that where the obstruction interfere with a criminal investigation the offense level to be adopt be take from the guideline for the offense of accessory after the fact the two friend brendan brennan and paul hansen then steal a minivan at about the same time brady steal a pontiac bonneville park several block away from the minivan no one of these be the right answer as a matter of law for all case of refusal to testify rather the choice of the good analogy be likely to depend in part on the circumstance brady argue that the choice of analogy be a question of law subject to de novo review influence obstruct or impede or endeavor to influence obstruct or impede the due administration of justice shall be punish as provide in 18 u.s.c.

ferreras challenge the district court 's denial of his suppression motion contend that the search of the attic at his 30 pekin street residence violate the fourth amendment the office be reasonably consider by the search agent as part of or even appurtenant to the property to be search the only access to the attic be via the set of step from the small hallway on the second floor ferreras move to suppress the physical evidence on ground that the search of the third floor exceed the scope of the warrant the face of the affidavit show that detective edward leste of the providence police department have information from a reliable informant that damian ferreras be store and sell cocaine from his apartment locate at 30 pekin street 2nd floor apt and also store cocaine in the basement as in martnez ferreras posit that the government fail to introduce testimony as to the water solubility of the cocaine base when investigator fail to limit themselves to the particular in the warrant both the particularity requirement and the probable cause requirement be drain of all significance as restraining mechanism and the warrant limitation become a practical nullity in this case as in martnez and robinson the government adduce competent scientific evidence from a chemist to prove that the 101.74 gram of contraband associate with ferreras 's arrest be cocaine base give the witness 's qualification his opinion constitute competent proof of the fact that the substance be cocaine base with attach carport also authorize the search of a disabled car park adjacent to the carport and a birdhouse hang from a tree about fifteen foot from the trailer step at the top of the stair be a door with a lock he thus find that the search of the attic be within the scope of the search warrant

the search of the attic at 30 pekin street must be reasonably consider part of the area intend to be search there be no door at either the bottom or the top of the step secure access to the attic the door open into a small hallway on the second floor and be closed but not lock just inside the entrance there be a door lead to the cellar and a flight of stair up to the second floor ferreras go on to say that the money in the boot belong to he but that the drug belong to another man for whom ferreras be hold the drug from that point forward as in martnez and robinson competent lay testimony such as that of detective leste remark on the substance 's distinctive appearance and texture and identify it as crack complete the final link in the evidentiary chain search the room far the detective find in a frame for a stereo speaker an electronic digital scale of a type commonly use to weigh narcotic he complain that the government produce no evidence as to the water solubility of the cocaine base at the hearing he examine the cocaine base which have be seize from ferreras 's boot and note that it be hard lumpy and brown alan scribner by appointment of the court for appellant we hold

fair allocation trial within the meaning of section 9613(f rule from the bench on december 2 1996 the court determine that view in the light most favorable to plaintiff the case against each of the three defendant suffer primarily from insufficiency of the evidence even when consider with waste dispose by other person could have contribute to the environmental harm at the site or to the incurrence of response cost and therefore such waste can not be the basis for the imposition of any liability upon it 1993 the second circuit reaffirm the restatement second of torts approach to flesh out the scope of cercla liability hold that where environmental harm be divisible a defendant may be hold responsible only for his proportional share of the response cost mohasco afc and ottaway move for judgment as a matter of law argue in substance that the environmental harm at sullivan 's ledge be divisible and that the evidence be insufficient to permit a finding that the material the defendant dump at the site cause any response cost lest there be any doubt the trial judge reiterate that the sullivan 's ledge group 's claim against these three defendant fail on two independent ground first the evidence be insufficient to bring afc mohasco and ottaway within the group for which the calculus of appropriate proportional share of liability for response cost could be make and secondly on ground of a lack of showing of causal connection with respect to remediation cost the district court grant the motion during a hearing on june 11 1996 follow by a more extensive opinion issue july 24 rule that nett have proffer uncontradicted expert testimony assert that nett do not cause and in fact could not have cause the plaintiff to incur any response cost see o'neil 883 f.2d at 179 n.4 expressly rejecting in a related context the argument that one must demonstrate that defendant be a substantial cause of the contamination before cercla liability attache in round out the cast of defendant plaintiff allege that the new bedford standard times the predecessor to ottaway generate and disposed of ink sludge burst with sulfuric acid nitric acids and various metal we affirm the judgment on the basis that the evidence be inadequate to permit a rational factfinder to make a quantifiable allocation of response cost to afc mohasco or ottaway under 9613(f 1989 we embrace the restatement second of torts approach in construe the statute state that a defendant may avoid joint and several liability if the defendant demonstrate that the harm be divisible plaintiff evidence at trial tend to show that afc be responsible for hazardous waste at sullivan 's ledge on a scale thousand of time less than the remain contribution of other that in term of sheer mass the two cubic yard of solid waste attributable to afc constitute an insignificant amount of pollution when compare to over one million cubic yard of waste find at sullivan 's ledge that the remediation plan be largely drive by the presence of hazardous substance other than copper and zinc and that the material attributable to afc be not as toxic as the other substance discover at the site namely pahs volatile organic compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls plaintiff appellant collectively know as the sullivan 's ledge group be thirteen corporation which receive notice from the u.s. environmental protection agency epa advise that the government consider they responsible for the pollution of sullivan 's ledge under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla we turn now to the district court 's ruling in favor of afc mohasco and ottaway in extend the principle a half step the second circuit go on to say that a defendant may escape any liability for response cost if it either succeed in prove that its waste when mix with other hazardous waste do not contribute to the release and cleanup cost that follow or contribute at most to only a divisible portion of the harm we find that to the extent that the plaintiff incur cost in connection with the planning and design of the treatment facility before it become aware of possible pollution by the defendant it have not respond to any threatened future release but have only spend money to address the actual contamination of the site here the court find the respective quantity of hazardous material attributable to each defendant the toxicity of the respective waste and their durability to be highly relevant to fix an equitable share the court explain that at most plaintiff have succeed in show that two cubic yard of solid cable waste be attributable to afc comprise no more than a fraction of the lead and zinc find at sullivan 's ledge look at afc as perhaps plaintiff good shoot among the three although the court initially frame it in term of causation erroneously we believe a finding of no liability on the part of nett be nevertheless justify under the principle of equitable allocation under 9613(f the alcan ii panel take great pain to leave question of liability include the divisibility of environmental harm and equitable apportionment of clean up expense to the sound discretion of the trial judge to be handle in the manner and order he or she deem well accord to the complaint new bedford rayon the predecessor in interest to mohasco deposit waste from the manufacture of rayon filament thread contain inter alia sodium hydroxide copper and sulfuric acid we add that even if the trial court 's explanation be less than lucid which they be not we would still have the power to affirm on any ground apparent on the face of the record the standard for contribution liability be the same as that under 9607(a see prisco v. a&amp;d carting corp. 168 f.3d 593 603 2d cir eventually the epa identify a number of business entity or their successor in interest which it believe be legally responsible for the decade long pollution at the site the district court dismiss these contribution claim grant nett 's motion for summary judgment before trial and enter judgment as a matter of law for mohasco afc and ottaway at the close of plaintiff case in chief 1998 a party 's spill may have be too inconsequential to affect the cost of clean up significantly and in that event a zero allocation would be appropriate posner j. although the court flirt with the prospect of enter judgment by way of rule 52 say whichever way i go about it it would come about the same we think it sufficiently clear that the court intend to employ judgment as a matter of law as its principal lens for view plaintiff claim to satisfy the causal element it be usually enough to show that a defendant be a responsible party within the meaning of 9607(a that clean up effort be undertake because of the presence of one or more hazardous substance identify in cercla and that reasonable cost be expend during the operation because accord to the court plaintiff fail to adduce any evidence directly challenge this expert testimony the court find no triable issue of fact as to causation and enter summary judgment in favor of nett as the move party nett undertake the burden of satisfy the court that its motion ought to be grant that however be the only situation in which we have find an insufficient causal nexus between a defendant and the remediation expenditure to read a quantitative threshold into the language cause the incurrence of response cost would cast the plaintiff in the impossible role of trace chemical waste to particular source in particular amount a task that be often technologically infeasible due to the fluctuate quantity and varied nature of the pollution at a site over the course of many year

benefit plan within the meaning of erisa the statement allegedly make to plaintiff binsky buck stevens ziemba and faniel fall within the ordinary rule that false statement of opinion of condition to exist in the future or of matter promissory in nature be not actionable in a claim for misrepresentation plaintiff sigmund ziemba claim that in the spring of 1992 he happen to see robert pouliot a senior officer at the company in a hallway the belief of the maker without certainty as to the existence of the fact thus to the extent that they be premise upon these statement the misrepresentation claim of plaintiff binsky buck stevens ziemba and faniel be properly dismiss as they do not meet the statement of fact requirement under massachusetts law thus plaintiff rodowicz be entitle to present his misrepresentation and equitable estoppel claim to a jury although as say supra he can not rely upon the statement make by president wheeler in the state of the company speech the precede discussion dispose of the claim of plaintiff binsky buck kennedy ziemba and faniel we affirm the district court 's grant of summary judgment in favor of massmutual with regard to the massachusetts common law claim of plaintiff binsky buck kennedy ziemba and faniel but reverse the grant of summary judgment with regard to the state law claim of plaintiff rodowicz lemon and stevens the court also state again without elaboration that it be a stretch to characterize any of the statement make to plaintiff as representation of fact at all the company argue that in the event we determine that reversal of the district court 's grant of summary judgment be warrant in any respect plaintiff should be permit to proceed if at all only with regard to their erisa- base claim in addition to these specific statement each of the plaintiff assert that they be mislead by wheeler 's statement quote in the february 12 1992 massmutual news to the effect that the company be in good financial condition and there would be no change in the company 's course the district court conclude without explanation that t]he undisputed fact confirm that no employee of the defendant knowingly or unknowingly convey a false statement of any kind let alone one of material fact to the plaintiff to induce they to act yet as the district court find the vtp do not call for the sort of ongoing individualized determination necessitate by the tin parachute statute address in simas the february 14 1992 issue of the company newsletter the massmutual news summarize wheeler 's remark by october 12 1992 the term of the vtp be draft and the compensation committee of massmutual 's board of directors for the first time authorize wheeler to adopt the plan at his discretion the district court reason that the one time bonus offer for the two month period in the vtp like the offer make in belanger be available to you all full time massmutual employee require little in the way of administrative burden or expense and do not require that the company make a long term financial commitment to any employee who choose to participate in the vtp summary judgment be appropriate where the pleading deposition answer to interrogatory and admission on file together with the affidavit if any show that there be no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the move party be entitle to judgment as a matter of law accordingly the statement make by these employee to respectively plaintiff binsky buck kennedy lemon and ziemba be not make on behalf of the company and for that reason be not actionable the district court conclude that these three factor do not coalesce here until at the early september 30 1992 when pajak and alfano make their presentation to the president 's cabinet the statement allegedly rely upon by plaintiff must be one of fact not of expectation estimate opinion or judgment in order for plaintiff to hold massmutual liable for the allege misrepresentation make by its employee plaintiff must demonstrate that the declarant have actual or at least apparent authority to speak on behalf of the company with respect to retirement benefit on september 17 1992 wheeler pajak and other senior massmutual executive meet for the purpose of review the company 's five year budget far unlike the plan in simas the district court reason that the vtp do not require the administrator to make exclusion determination over an extended period of time finally the district court conclude that the company 's decision to defer the election date of some employee up to june 30 1993 impose no ongoing administrative burden or financial obligation on the company but rather merely defer the writing of a check until that time thus to the extent that plaintiff claim be base upon statement in the company newsletter they be properly dismiss in february 1992 thomas wheeler massmutual 's chief executive officer deliver an annual state of the company speech to all employee in 1995 this court in belanger v. wyman gordon co. 71 f.3d 451 clarify the circumstance under which benefit give to employee would constitute a plan for purpose of erisa as all but two of the plaintiff have retire prior to that time and as the two remain employee make no inquiry regard an enhanced retirement package after september 17 1992 the district court conclude that none of the plaintiff have a viable misrepresentation claim in march 1992 john pajak massmutual 's chief operating officer assign to senior member of his management team the task of determine the cost and saving from a workforce reduction after consideration however the company decide against workforce reduction at the time the question under fort halifax as we acknowledge in simas be a matter of degree we agree that the

judgment be properly grant with regard to the equitable estoppel claim bring by plaintiff binsky buck kennedy ziemba and faniel with regard to employee matson walker egan cardwell and pouliot no evidence even suggest conduct by the principal that we also affirm although on ground somewhat different from those state by the district court the dismissal of most of plaintiff state law claim but reverse and remand for trial the claim of three of the eight plaintiff in an opinion issue on july 27 1994 the district court deny in part defendant motion to dismiss with regard to the two erisa count but allow the motion with regard to the misrepresentation claim on the ground that plaintiff common law misrepresentation claim be preempt by erisa for the reason that follow we affirm the district court 's dismissal of plaintiff erisa claim define materiality for purpose of serious consideration test as substantial likelihood that the misrepresentation would mislead a reasonable

placement at smlc during the pendency of the verhoevens challenge to the june 1 1998 iep 's interim placement and one party the verhoevens who claim that they at least view the hearing officer as merely the first adjudicator of the stay put issue 1415(j even if the district court have err in find that the submission of the stay put issue to the hearing officer satisfy the otherwise agree exception to the stay put presumption we would be incline to uphold the district court 's denial of the verhoevens request for another reason c. conclusions regard the mootness of the verhoevens request in sum we can not agree with the district court that the verhoevens motion for a stay put injunction be moot by the hearing officer 's october 2 1998 decision on the merit of the verhoevens placement challenge offer the affidavit of carolyn crowell brunswick 's director of special services brunswick argue to the district court that the party agree at an august 13 1998 pre hearing conference on a process for determine the interim placement thus satisfy the otherwise agree exception the district court 's conclusion that the party satisfy the exception to the stay put provision by otherwise agree[ing to allow the hearing officer to choose the interim placement even though the district court 's finding and rationale regard mootness be somewhat murky its ruling on the merit of the injunction request could not be more clear the court then conclude that because the verhoevens agree to submit that issue to the hearing officer for resolution the case fall within an exception to the stay put provision for when the party otherwise agree on a stay put placement the district court conclude that because the verhoevens agree to submit the stay put issue to the hearing officer they otherwise agree[d to depart from the stay put placement during the pendency of the proceeding the existence of such an agreement be support by crowell 's affidavit in which she state that the party agree on august 13 1998 to allow the hearing officer to resolve the stay put dispute due to the impending first day of school to the contrary the party expressly agree that p.j. in the present case the district court do not purport to reach the merit of the stay put dispute it deny the motion as moot also the district court do not state that the motion be moot due to the hearing officer 's august 28 1998 decision resolve the stay put issue it state that the motion be moot due to the hearing officer 's october 2 1998 decision which resolve the overall placement challenge first they argue that the district court could have find that the request be moot because the verhoevens only request stay put relief during the pendency of administrative proceeding which end with the hearing officer 's decision on october 2 1999 c. conclusions regard the merits of the verhoevens request in sum we do not disturb the district court 's conclusion that the party otherwise agree[d to allow the hearing officer to determine p.j. would return to the brunswick public school system for the 1998 99 year and 2 that the smlc placement be a temporary placement only the district court conclude that because the verhoevens agree to submit the stay put issue to the hearing officer the case fall within the otherwise agree exception to the stay put provision however the district court then appear to reach the merit of the stay put issue in find that this case fall within the exception to the automatic stay put provision of 20 u.s.c. just as the hearing officer 's statement in leonard put the party on notice that the placement at the lab school be temporary and would cease at the end of the 1985 86 school year the party 1997 settlement agreement in the present case make it quite clear that the smlc placement be temporary and would cease at the end of the 1997 98 school year the verhoevens derive this interpretation from the district court 's finding that the verhoevens decision to submit the stay put issue to the hearing officer for resolution place this case within the exception to the stay put provision for when the educational agency and the parent otherwise agree the effect of allow the hearing officer to rule on the stay put issue the verhoevens offer an alternative interpretation of the district court 's finding of mootness the district court may have find that the verhoevens motion be moot because they forfeit their right to a judicial determination of the stay put issue by first submit the issue to a hearing officer on october 2 1998 the hearing officer deny the verhoevens challenge to the iep and order p.j. from this the court determine that the leonards be on notice that the lab school would cease to be the current educational placement once the 1985- 86 school year end second they argue that the district court could have find that the verhoevens forfeit their right to judicial review of the stay put issue by submit the issue to a hearing officer the placement at smlc the placement that the verhoevens believe should prevail during the pendency of their challenge to the iep return p.j. the preservation of the status quo ensure that the student remain in the last placement that the parent and the educational authority agree to be appropriate accordingly the court decline to compel dcps to fund brandon 's interim placement at the lab school because the lab school be not the proper stay put placement under section 1415(j the district court find that brunswick and the verhoevens otherwise agree[d to let the hearing officer determine the interim placement section 1415(j provide that during the pendency of any proceeding conduct pursuant to this section unless the state or local educational agency and the parent otherwise agree the child shall remain in the then current educational placement of such child brunswick subsequently remove the complaint to the united states district court for the district of maine and the case be assign to judge carter finally the court state that whatever interest the verhoevens have in seek review of the hearing officer 's placement decision fall outside the parameter of the present complaint and should be pursue by file a separate action there be no dispute that the party submit the interim placement issue to the hearing officer but that do not necessarily mean that they agree to let she choose the interim placement within the meaning of the otherwise agree exception the court state 1 that it be clear to all party that the lab school placement be for the 1985 86 school year only and 2 that the hearing officer encourage the party to prepare for a transition back to prospect learning center order brunswick to fund a private placement at smlc during the challenge to the iep be not the type of maintenance of the status quo that section 1415(j envision as a result we do not find the district court 's conclusion regard the existence of an agreement under section 1415(j to be clearly erroneous and we therefore uphold the district court 's denial of the motion for an injunction but to the extent that we be review the district court 's determination regard the applicability of the stay put provision that constitute mixed question of law and fact our review be more deferential in their complaint the verhoevens seek relief from the hearing officer 's stay put decision in the form of a preliminary injunction require brunswick to provide funding for p.j. the court go on to find that the party agree to submit the stay put issue to the hearing officer for resolution to the contrary it would be an extension of this temporary placement to a degree well beyond the party intention at the time of the 1997 settlement agreement the verhoevens now characterize this submission as the pursuit of a reviewable administrative ruling on the interim placement issue while brunswick claim that the party agree at a pre hearing conference on august 13 1998 to accept as final the hearing officer 's decision on the interim placement issue the court find that the verhoevens entitlement to a stay put injunction become moot by virtue of the hearing officer 's decision date october 2 1998 decide all issue submit to the hearing officer in the verhoevens motion they cite anrig for its statement that the stay put provision be design to preserve the status quo during administrative and judicial proceeding under the idea the verhoevens also cite two case for the proposition that review of the denial of a stay put injunction be plenary because the entitlement to an automatic injunction under the stay put provision be a question of law if the parent of the child object to the child 's placement they be entitle to file a complaint with the educational agency and to have that complaint resolve at an impartial due process hearing and to the extent that what we be review be a legal issue under the stay put provision such as the determination of what constitute p.j. on october 30 1998 the verhoevens file the present appeal of the district court 's denial of their request for interim injunctive relief 's interim placement in a private school during the pendency of the verhoevens challenge to p.j. crowell declare that the party agree to let the hearing officer resolve the stay put issue and do so because of the rapidly approach first day of school at brunswick high school however in the case of p.j. confront with this dispute the district court side with brunswick and find that the party otherwise agree[d to let the hearing officer decide the interim placement and we have no basis for find this determination to be clearly erroneous

time of the sinking number three on the one hand mariner maintain that the word be unambiguous and that its common meaning include the entire complement of individual work aboard a vessel in any capacity e.g. ordinary seaman deck hand the cook the engineer the mate the captain on this reading mariner urge the district court to find that morse the captain necessarily comprise part of the crew and that therefore his presence together with that of three ordinary seaman breach the warranty the defendant mariner management group inc. and clarendon insurance co. collectively mariner or the insurer pay the bulk of greenly 's claim but withhold $ 34,370 as a coinsurance penalty applicable to payment make to settle the seamen 's claim under the protection and indemnity p&amp;i provision of greenly 's policy on de novo review the district judge agree with greenly in the first instance he find that the word crew in and of itself be ambiguous the gist of the district court 's conception with which we agree be that the insurance company from a risk and premium standpoint probably envision that it be insure three not four person serve the vessel and would have want high premium for a fourth such person whether an ordinary seaman or a non owner captain consequently we reverse the judgment of the district court he appoint a member of the crew brian morse to serve as captain an action that the policy allow he to take without permission from or notification to the insurer accordingly this case be govern by the well settle rule that in doubtful situation involve genuine ambiguity policy language be to be construe against the insurer who draft the policy and thus could have avoid the ambiguity and in favor of maximize coverage there be some furth albeit thin support for this view urge by the insurer in the language of the binder that precede the policy 's issuance greenly on the other hand maintain that the word crew at the very least exclude the ship 's captain greenly learn of the sinking on january 28 1998 and immediately report it to the insurer it cite the insurance policy 's crew warranty clause assert that this clause contemplate a maximum of three crew member and that although the insured retain the right to add crew member he could only assure full coverage by notify the insurer before the fact and pay a premium surcharge neither of which greenly have do but this prove to be a pyrrhic victory for the judge go on to rule that r]ead in its context the crew warranty objectively manifest an intent to cover the captain as well as other member of the ship 's crew while it leave room for the insurer 's interpretation that by operation of the clause the insure warrant that the vessel will be man by a company of three count the captain it make equally plausible the insured 's interpretation that by operation of the clause the insure warrant that the vessel will be man by a company of three not count the captain however the policy itself do not incorporate that language and the term contain in a binder only regulate coverage until the actual policy issue at which time they be supplant by the term of the policy 1333(1 greenly sue in the federal district court to recover the withhold amount without go into detail this language can be read as juxtapose the premium to be charge with the proposition that the coverage be for three crew member exclude the captain because he be an owner this appeal arise out of the sinking of a 65 foot fishing trawler the f v miss penelope off the maine coast but a lay person would have no reason to share this perspective and the fact remain that the term crew both in general usage and in the context of this particular policy be patently ambiguous moreover the passage of time have do little to demystify the term the critical provision be the crew warranty clause which provide in consideration of the premium charge it be warrant that coverage hereunder be provide for not more than three 3 crew member aboard the insure vessel at any one time in parse insurance policy maine court must scrutinize policy language from the perspective of an average person untrained in the law or the insurance field in light of what a more than casual reading of the policy would reveal to an ordinarily intelligent insure in this instance our review of the relevant policy language lead we to conclude that the crew warranty clause contain an ambiguity as to the captain 's status coverage dispute usually depend upon the language of the policy and this case be no different thus state law here maine law supply the substantive rule of decision if however an ordinary person would not understand with some degree of assurance that the provision have a single accept meaning ambiguity loom although the question be close we reject the district court 's analysis here the insured reasonably could have think that a non owner captain be not consider part of the crew and that he be fully protect despite the introduction of a new captain group inc. civ like the low court we focus on the narrow question of whether captain morse should be deem a member of the crew for purpose of the crew warranty clause the district judge thereupon reject the magistrate 's recommendation deny greenly 's motion for summary judgment and grant mariner 's cross motion in this vein the court point principally to the policy 's p&amp;i coverage note that the owner would have an additional exposure to liability for maintenance and cure or for jones act damage to a non owner captain and that this fact would thus be within the party contemplation when contracting for p&amp;i coverage the key to interpret this clause lie in the meaning of the word crew while the fact that the policy supersede the binder do not necessarily render the binder irrelevant in construe ambiguous policy wording the binder itself be not crystal clear and the omission of the language to which mariner point can easily be take to mean that the party reject the notion the district court disagree with the magistrate 's recommendation in relevant part conclude that mariner 's position be well take and grant its motion for brevis disposition co. 730 a.2d 175 180 i co. 724 a.2d 1258 1261 i if the assured shall fail to give such prior notice and at the time of loss with respect to crew there be more crew on

between yerardi and feghi action take by feghi pursuant to the power of attorney that yerardi have give to she and similar matter here we think that the connection between the government 's criminal forfeiture proceeding direct against yerardi and the possible prosecution of he e.g. for tax evasion relate to concealment of the same asset be close enough that the privilege may fairly be assert in the forfeiture proceed to guard against the use of feghi 's testimony to convict yerardi thereafter however this assume that the government have question to ask feghi the answer to which could not plausibly threaten the legal interest of yerardi in a future criminal prosecution relate to any conceal asset the district court assume and we agree that the privilege could not be justify merely because feghi 's testimony might help the government recover former or present asset of yerardi subject to criminal forfeiture the appellant rafia feghi be married to joseph a. yerardi jr. far even if he have not we be doubtful that the rationale of the privilege would be offend by make feghi assist the government in locate those of yerardi 's asset subject to forfeiture if this be the only adverse consequence say to flow from the testimony however feghi 's purported fear be not confine to yerardi 's loss of property she also assert in the district court and argue forcefully in this court that various of the question pose by the government could lead to subsequent criminal prosecution of yerardi for tax evasion or related crime it may be generalization enough to say that the relationship between two proceeding which itself bear on the probability of an adverse effect be likely to be a matter of degree and that a case by case resolution will have to do for the present accordingly we vacate the present order of contempt and remand the case to the district court so that the government may furnish the necessary affidavit if it be so minded if this be not so it be hard to see why the government 's letter would explicitly reserve to it the right to use feghi 's testimony indirectly i.e. through fruit evidence derive from it in a future prosecution far the government want to locate other yerardi asset which feghi may control or know of that could be available to the government to make up the value of any directly forfeit asset that can no long be find the privilege apply only to adverse testimony and conceivably some or all of the question answer in the bail hearing may not have be adverse to yerardi and some formulation of the privilege and dicta in some of the case assume that the privilege could never be assert in a civil case after all as trammel explain the main concern of the privilege be the threat to marital harmony and the arguable unseemliness of require one spouse to assist in the criminal conviction or incarceration of the other spouse pursuant to that agreement yerardi plead guilty to all count of the indictment and in accordance with 18 u.s.c. the privilege be a companion to but distinct from the privilege protect confidential communication between husband and wife 1991 allow the long civil period to appeal from a forfeiture order or at least as separable from the main criminal action see united states v. hurley 63 f.3d 1 23 24 1st cir the government add that the legislative history of the rico statute see h.r. accordingly the government serve a subpoena duce tecum on feghi in october 1995 later enforce in part by the district court and it depose feghi on march 22 1996 finally a word should be say about the district court 's statement already quote that another reason for compelling feghi to answer now be that a trial court would retain the power later to exclude her testimony if offer in a new prosecution of yerardi since the effect be to be feel in a different proceeding the government contend that for this reason as well the spousal privilege should not be allow the government as just note have not press on we the district court 's suggestion that a final ruling on the privilege issue might be defer the government concede that feghi do not at any point expressly waive the privilege which certainly she could do but it assert that by answer question in the same general area without assert the privilege she have engage in conduct tantamount to waiver of the privilege at the threshold the government urge that the privilege have be waive because yerardi in his plea agreement consent both to the forfeiture and to full discovery by the government of all information need to implement the forfeiture however the government have not argue that all of its question be benign and most address to the concealment of asset be not likely to be because the privilege be root in a dual desire to protect marital harmony and to avoid the unseemliness of compelling one spouse to testify against the other in a criminal proceeding i d. maness v. meyers 419 u.s. 449 473 1975 white j. concur in the result yet snoonian itself hold that a spouse can assert the privilege in a grand jury proceed to which no private person be a party even though the adverse effect on the other spouse would occur in what be formally a different proceeding namely the later prosecution of that spouse it be worth add that the government control the scope of its questioning which can be tailor to limit the tainting of future evidence here the proceeding be criminal yerardi be a party but the only likely adverse effect-- apart from the irrelevant loss of property be future prosecution of yerardi for tax evasion or like crime in another case the government which needless to say prefer an outright rejection of the privilege claim have not stress this possibility and it be not clear whether the district court view it as an alternative ground for deny the privilege or simply as a pertinent consideration if feghi 's testimony be essential to recover forfeit property which it may be the government as we shall explain need only file an affidavit provide the same protection normally afford when testimony be compel from a witness who claim the privilege against self- incrimination after a hearing on december 21 1998 the district court hold feghi in contempt for refuse to answer and it impose prospectively civil penalty on feghi rise after two week to $ 1,000 per day to compel obedience point again to yerardi 's plea agreement the government contend that testimony can not be adverse where the defendant spouse have consent to it fail that the government be still entitle to depose feghi but she be entitle to invoke the adverse spousal testimony privilege on a question by question basis and subject to district court scrutiny under standard set forth above we need not pursue the issue because even if the privilege can only be assert in a criminal proceeding the proceeding in which feghi be here seek to be question be ancillary to a criminal case and seek to recover a penalty under criminal forfeiture provision this appeal which present difficult question concern the adverse spousal testimony privilege arise out of the follow fact thus far we have treat the question that the government seek to compel feghi to answer as if they be all of a piece some formulation of the adverse spousal testimony privilege state or imply not only that the proceeding in which the testimony be compel must be criminal but that the adverse effect on the other spouse must be feel in the same proceeding however this be a burden that the prosecution customarily carry whenever it compel privileged testimony through a grant of use immunity by show that it have an independent source for the other evidence 984 1964 but the government do not invoke they against yerardi feghi testify at the forfeiture proceed in february 1995 invoke certain testimonial privilege but say the government not invoke the adverse spousal testimony privilege in general a privilege once establish be overcome only where co extensive protection e.g. immunity be assure at the time the answer be compel in april 1996 the government move to compel feghi to answer its question whatever weight might generally be accord to the district court 's finding we can not agree that the threat of an adverse affect on yerardi 's legal interest be so clearly speculative as to defeat the privilege

available for debrief appear as a witness speak truthfully provide document and so forth the paragraph explain that he be not expect to make a case against anyone 1995 for the same proposition see santobello v. new york 404 u.s. 257 262 1971 hold that when a plea rest in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor so that it can be say to be part of the inducement or consideration the promise must be fulfil in this way the agreement make it quite clear that compliance with the covenant contain in paragraph 8 constitute a necessary but not an independently sufficient precondition to the filing of a section 5k1.1 motion it then bundle group of these loan and peddle the package to large financial institution most prominently citibank in each case represent that the purchaser would receive the functional equivalent of a first mortgage viz an assignment of bfmc 's first mortgage in the case at bar the agreement read as a whole plainly be mean to be understand in term of the general approach limn in section 5k1.1 finally the path that we have map out comport with our oft state belief that in criminal case evidentiary hearing should be the exception not the rule we have repeatedly state that even in the criminal context a defendant be not entitle as of right to an evidentiary hearing on a pretrial or posttrial motion in his declaration the appellant state that he have misgiving about whether the united states attorney 's office would reward cooperation with a favorable sentencing recommendation he trace these misgiving to a previous case in which the united states attorney allegedly make similar overture to another bank executive but subsequently renege and therefore arrange to meet personally with guillermo gil the united states attorney for the district of puerto rico prior to settle upon a course of action d the appellant 's final departure relate argument be that if the absence of a government motion place section 5k1.1 beyond his reach the district court give his cooperation nonetheless should have depart downward under the general departure guideline ussg 5k2.0 in short full complete and truthful cooperation in and of itself be not coextensive with the substantial assistance of which the sentencing guideline speak insurance unlike pledged asset do not diminish the impact of the fraud we make this point emphatically in doe when we explain that d]efendant ask for information to incriminate other have good reason to fear for their safety and unless the prosecutor hold the whip hand the defendant may offer up some information and hold back the more vital balance in the hope that the court will find the government unreasonable and infer bad faith in the appellant 's view the title insurance function essentially as pledge asset see ussg 2f1.1 comment we review the district court 's decision as to whether to go far that be whether to convene an evidentiary hearing on the issue of the government 's good faith for abuse of discretion we now answer it adopt the reasoning of our sister circuit and hold that a defendant 's assistance to the prosecutor can not serve as the basis for a section 5k2.0 departure indeed doe never argue as alegra do that cooperation if render mandate the filing of a section 5k1.1 motion thus even though a plea agreement state unambiguously as this one do that the government retain absolute discretion with respect to the filing of a section 5k1.1 motion the accuse be entitle to expect that the government will honestly evaluate the appropriateness of seek a downward departure in the first place soft pedal the integration clause and slip an antecedent oral promise into the text would render other of the agreement 's relevant passage such as paragraph 11 entirely nugatory the other include thing well beyond the purview of cooperation per se such as the significance and utility of the information provide i d. moreover the mortgagor go into default on the original mortgage notwithstanding their payment to the purchaser the appellant 's principal objection to the district court 's loss calculation be that it fail to take into account the fact that citibank because it enjoy the benefit of title insurance never run a risk of lose anything on the mortgage transaction rather insurance simply shift the loss to another victim the insurance company so it be irrelevant in calculate the amount of loss for sentencing purpose rest in the sole discretion of the united states and far provide that dispute about that decision will not be refer to the district court burns in the course of appeal the district court 's enhancement of his sentence under a guideline provision argue that a clause in the plea agreement which restrain the government from recommend such an increase at sentencing imply a duty not to oppose burns 's effort to set aside the increase on appeal it involve a write fully integrated plea agreement in which the government promise in its discretion to make a lenient recommendation at sentence if the defendant 's cooperation be complete and truthful although the appellant profess to be sanguine about the value of the information that he furnish the record contain no indication that any of it be useful to the government the obvious implication of this explicit reference to section 5k1.1 be that the prosecutor will take into account all the factor delineate in that guideline when determine whether to move for a downward departure and those factor as we have note go well beyond full complete and truthful cooperation that case arise before the sentencing guideline and hence section 5k1.1 go into effect the appellant 's construction contemplate an equivalency between full complete and truthful cooperation on the one hand and substantial assistance on the other

court smith barney file a motion in limine contend that the default judgment obtain in massachusetts state court on august 26 1996 collaterally estop josephine from relitigate whether the mystic

smith barney adduce be that josephine perform minor ministerial task by occasionally drive her husband to the bank to make deposit in corporate account and by fill out the date payee name and amount space on some corporate check at anthony 's specific direction at that point smith barney briefly call josephine to the stand then rest its case in due course the bankruptcy court enter judgment for josephine thus it be not surprising that after the court deny the in limine motion smith barney manage only a lame attempt to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court that josephine should be hold personally liable smith barney neither contend nor have it demonstrate that its claim against mystic valley and the estate of anthony strangie be no long pending nor that smith barney ever seek to

31	31	198658.json	 and of course trial counsel normally need to know before they sum up and argue about the evidence to the jury whether the evidence to be consider by the jury in its deliberation will include hearsay statement provisionally admit in the expectation that all of the evidence may lead to an affirmative petrozziello finding however in deny the adjustment the district court say the follow now turn to the question of adjustment for role in the offense i do not want to spend too much time on that in resolve an in limine motion to suppress file by murphy the district court have conclude over objection base on relevance and prejudice that the government could offer evidence of the detective general practice of falsifying warrant and not report cash but that evidence as to specific instance must be confine to the two incident involve murphy specifically brazil testify that at the police station on the night of the edgemere road search he hear robinson say that he know machore 's attorney i.e. murphy and word to the effect that ` i know the attorney i 'll talk to he we can work this out word to that effect the government do not claim to have prove that murphy be ever a member of the broad conspiracy and indeed early in the case disclaim any such intention while the indictment charge the detective with a broad scheme and many wrongful seizure murphy be name in only three count count 2 base on both of the incident just describe charge murphy and the two detective with conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right 18 u.s.c. on the factual side murphy 's argument be in substance that the district judge confuse two different conspiracy the broad continue conspiracy from 1990 through 1996 between acerra and robinson to commit unlawful seizure and keep the proceed and the narrow extortion conspiracy from may through september of 1992 to which murphy be a party in the raid the detective seize cash represent drug sale proceed that they keep for themselves instead of turn it over to the boston police department the objection make in a motion for a new trial that the district court deny be base on the tenth circuit 's later discard decision in united states v. singleton 144 f.3d 1343 10th cir this delay say murphy be error and should invalidate the finding and evidence admit pursuant to it because this court 's precedent allegedly require the finding before the case go to the jury murphy explain to almonte and also to machore 's girlfriend who be almonte 's sister that the detective would fail to appear at the grand jury lead to the release of the defendant under a state law that require release when a grand jury do not indict within two sitting at trial the government offer evidence that in the year the extortion occur the boston police department make substantial purchase of good and service in interstate commerce murphy obtain the money on june 29 1992 put $ 1,500 in his business account and take out the balance in cash whether some be then pay to the detective be unknown for the most part the out of court statement in question be simply direction e.g. to make false statement in the warrant application and not statement of fact at all an explicit petrozziello finding before the case go to the jury be surely the well practice absent very unusual circumstance in this circuit a predicate to the admission of hearsay evidence under the co conspirator exception be a finding by the district judge that a conspiracy exist of which the defendant be a member and that the statement be make in furtherance of that conspiracy in all likelihood the district court assume that counsel understand that the statement be now to be treat as admit since the jury having hear the testimony be not be tell to disregard it and that the court be postpone its formal finding so that it could review the trial evidence at great leisure murphy then move for the return of the $ 7,500 on the ground that it have be improperly seize and base on false statement by robinson and without objection from the prosecutor the judge order a return of the money murphy argue that the district judge do not make a timely petrozziello finding of conspiracy before the case go to the jury that the petrozziello finding make after the jury return with the verdict be erroneous and that the admission of the allege hearsay be prejudicial and do not constitute harmless error indeed prior to jury deliberation the district judge tell counsel that the finding would be make after the verdict by which time the judge would have have an opportunity to review the trial evidence thus to the extent that the detective make out of court statement before the extortion conspiracy begin they could not be offer against murphy for their truth the finding clearly necessary for admission of hearsay statement of the detective make during the extortion conspiracy be render by the trial judge after the jury verdict instead of paying almonte go to trial and be acquit due in part to the fact that none of the detective testify about find any money in the apartment in which almonte be arrest brazil testify that he be generally so instruct in other unnamed incident and specifically that he be tell to falsify the may 6 warrant application and not to report the may 29 seizure as previously describe when the general practice evidence be offer at trial murphy say that he make an adequate hearsay objection and that the court reject the objection rely on the co conspirator exception after the verdict the district court find as require by petrozziello that there be a specific conspiracy between mr. murphy mr. robinson and mr. acerra to obtain money through mean of extortion and conspiratorial preparation and conspiratorial coverup 801(c and while brazil certainly testify to statement make by the detective out of court those statement namely the instruction give to brazil to falsify application and withhold information about seizure be not offer for the truth of the matter assert but rather to show that the detective give such instruction the second incident begin even before the first one end on may 29 1992 when acerra and robinson obtain warrant again base on false statement to search two apartment in a building on edgemere road in west roxbury thereafter in august 1998 the district court sentence murphy to 24 month imprisonment the main answer be that other out of court statement by acerra and robinson concern the very episode at issue in murphy 's trial be or arguably be offer for their truth theft not extortion be the central element in these crime the former say murphy may now be permit if section 201(c)(2 be gloss by rely on other statute and past practice but the latter should still be forbid as outside the gloss or else the prosecutor could just pay witness money for their testimony use the warrant detective include acerra and robinson conduct search of the apartment on may 29 1992 and seize cocaine and between $ 16,000 and $ 17,500 in cash murphy now argue that the district court deny the adjustment on the premise mistake as a matter of law that middleman in extortion scheme be automatically disqualify from minor or minimal role adjustment much later when an investigation begin into the detective warrant practice murphy make false statement to help conceal the detective failure to report fund seize in both of the incident such evidence tend to support other evidence from brazil that the detective take similar step in the two episode in which murphy be involve and this in turn be pertinent to show murphy 's role in the two extortion effort grow out of the two seizure the case law explicitly provide that the petrozziello finding should be base on all of the evidence see ciampaglia 628 f.2d at 638 which explain why the judge must wait until all party have present their case in any event none of the money be ever return to machore murphy also refer we to the statement in the guideline commentary that the minimal role adjustment be intend to cover defendant who be plainly among the least culpable of those involve in a group crime u.s.s.g. although the government say that the hearsay objection be not preserve the point be debatable and it be easy to deal with the claim on their merit murphy represent machore tell the latter that this time robinson and acerra want a total of $ 50,000 for the release of machore and his three co defendant although murphy understand that the original singleton decision be overturn in its own circuit and widely disapprove of elsewhere see united states v. ramsey 165 f.3d 980 986 87 d.c. cir nor do murphy try to identify any other specific out of court statement of the two detective not make during the narrow extortion conspiracy that be admit against he for their truth
32	32	198660.json	 c. conclusions in sum we find that 1 the district court apply the correct standard for determine whether the fhwa be require to prepare an seis in light of the project change and 2 the fhwa properly consider the environmental effect of the project change and find that those effect be not significant in 1991 the project plan be revise and the fhwa prepare a final supplemental environmental impact statement fseis address the change to the project during a three day phase one nonjury trial the district court 1 take evidence in the form of affidavit that be not part of the administrative record see airport impact relief 45 f. supp on april 24 1998 mhd submit to the fhwa an environmental reevaluation of the propose change consist of the npc and additional information gather during the state review process appellant argue that the administrative record contain repeat correspondence between mhd and the fhwa about the trilateral land exchange the importance of the buffer area as an environmental mitigation on mhd 's part the value to massport of relocate sr-2 and the connection between the acquisition of the buffer area and the transfer of the robie parcel to massport after the fhwa review the environmental reevaluation fhwa division administrator markle issue a june 25 1998 decision letter to mhd concur in mhd 's conclusion that the propose change will have negligible environmental impact and therefore do not require the preparation of an seis in a june 1 1998 letter to the fhwa acting deputy regional administrator mindy lubber of the united states environmental protection agency epa express the opinion that the change merit a thorough environmental review and comment process under nepa in july of 1998 plaintiff file the present action challenge the fhwa 's approval of the project change and name as defendant 1 markle division administrator of the fhwa 2 kenneth r. wykle administrator of the fhwa 3 kevin j. sullivan commissioner of mhd and 4 patrick j. moynihan chairman of mbta and secretary of the executive office of transportation and construction finally the court find that the fhwa 's decision do not violate section 4(f of the department of transportation act however markle 's declaration clearly state that the fhwa consider the propose change to route 1a southbound and conclude 1 that its overall elevation be not materially different from its elevation in the 1991 fseis and 2 that place the roadway section in question on a viaduct structure rather than on retain fill would not have a significant environmental impact in count two and three which be not at issue in this appeal plaintiff claim that the fhwa violate 1 section 4(f of the department of transportation act of 1996 49 u.s.c. thus from the material submit by the fhwa it be clear that the fhwa properly consider the environmental effect of raise route 1a southbound after conduct what it term a phase one nonjury trial the district court enter judgment in favor of the defendant find that markle 's decision to approve the change to the project without prepare an seis be not arbitrary and capricious if all of the necessary contingency occur and massport eventually seek to expand the airport the faa will be the federal agency require to conduct an environmental review under nepa so there be no reason or need for the fhwa to consider the effect of airport expansion at this time appellant argue to the district court that the project change significantly affect the environment in negative way and in address these claim the district court find no such significant adverse effect to exist plaintiff appellant airport impact relief inc. air and individual resident of east boston file the present action to review and set aside the june 25 1998 decision of peter markle division administrator of the federal highway administration fhwa to approve the massachusetts highway department 's mhd revise plan for a construction project without prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement seis these include the acquisition of permit the arrangement of funding the drafting of expansion plan and other contingency that must occur before even the trilateral land exchange can occur appellant do not dispute that this conclusion be a sensible one but instead argue 1 that the district court should not have accept the markle declaration on this point and 2 that the declaration do not state precisely what the fhwa do to make its determination in 1985 the fhwa conduct an environmental review of the ca t project and prepare a final environmental impact statement feis of its opinion the court properly focus on all impact of the propose change rather than merely the adverse impact in particular appellant point to the allegedly negative effect that one change the elimination of the separate bus platform for the unloading and loading of passenger would have on the transit capacity of the station the district court conduct a three day phase one nonjury trial to address three issue 1 the extent to which evidence beyond the fhwa 's administrative record would be consider in review the fhwa 's decision 2 whether the evidence create a genuine issue of material fact that would require a phase two trial on the merit of the case and 3 whether any party be entitle to judgment as a matter of law at the end of the phase one trial in the environmental reevaluation mhd analyze the environmental impact of the propose change and express its belief that the fhwa need not conduct any further environmental review under the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa therefore even though the district court in find that the impact on transit capacity be properly consider do not specifically state that the fhwa also consider that impact we have no quarrel with the conclusion that the fhwa 's decision be not arbitrary or capricious in this regard 1976 state that a federal agency may even allow the state agency to prepare the eis itself so long as the federal agency furnish guidance participate in the preparation and independently evaluate the statement prior to its adoption appellant claim that the administrative record show that the fhwa do not conduct such an independent review of mhd 's datum analysis and conclusion however we first note that in at least one of the district court 's recitation of the standard in part v.a. thus all party agree that it be the significance of the environmental effect of the change that determine whether or not an seis must be prepare the court also allow defendant to supplement the record with affidavit from markle and the fhwa 's ca t project administrator thomas smith to explain the step take by the fhwa to reach their decision the court also find that the fhwa satisfy its nepa obligation to give consideration to the concern express by the epa in the june 1 1998 letter b. appellate review of the district court 's decision we of course be not the first court to review the fhwa 's decision the district court have already uphold that decision in a lengthy and thorough opinion therefore we do not fault the district court 's inclusion of the word adverse in its formulation of the standard on two occasion as part of this argument appellant also claim that the fhwa rely too heavily on mhd 's analysis and fail to conduct its own independent review of the effect of the project change call the plan for a second span speculative and contingent the second circuit uphold the fhwa 's failure to explicitly address the possible bridge expansion as a cumulative impact of the project change and the possible corridor development the fhwa 's administrative record be file with the district court and the party seek to resolve the case through cros motion for summary judgment 138 and 2 title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 42 u.s.c. in his declaration markle state that the fhwa independently review and evaluate the document and information contain in the mhd environmental reevaluation in addition to relocate sr-2 the propose change consist of 1 the relocation of airport station approximately 500 foot north of its current location 2 the redesign of airport station 's passenger entrance and bus platform include the elimination of the plan cross platform connection between logan airport shuttle bus and the blue line train 3 the elimination of a bus loop that would have connect both side of airport station 4 change in the elevation of ramp and roadway include raise route 1a southbound to as high as 36 foot 5 the realignment of ramp t s and service road sr-10 to terminal a 6 the widening and extension of service road sr-10 7 the elimination of service road sr-1 8) the redesign of ramp 1a s as a surface roadway and 9 the addition of service road sr-14 to connect logan airport and airport station regard the first argument we need only note our decision in sierra club ii in which we approve the supplementation of the administrative record through affidavit deposition or other proof of an explanatory nature markle state that the fhwa review these change for noise and visual impact on the bremen street residence and conclude that due to the shift away from bremen street and the insignificant elevation difference the impact would not be significant the court then turn to the likely environmental impact of the project change and find that the fhwa properly consider each impact raise by plaintiff and that those impact be not significant enough to require the preparation of an seis under nepa the relocation of sr-2 and the possibility of airport expansion appellant first argue that the fhwa act arbitrarily and capriciously by fail to consider the environmental effect of the relocation of sr-2 and the attendant expansion of logan airport that would result from the relocation of a park amp fly parking lot and the transfer of the robie parcel to massport if and when massport acquire title to the robie parcel and seek to expand the airport or otherwise change the manner in which the parcel be use that proposal will be subject to the requirement of nepa as well the task of a court review agency action under the apa 's arbitrary and capricious standard be to determine whether the agency have examine the pertinent evidence consider the relevant factor and articulate[d a satisfactory explanation for its action include a rational connection between the fact find and the choice make several member of the public include representative of appellant air raise environmental issue and concern regard the npc while the state environmental review process proceed mhd also request federal approval of the change from the fhwa in 1997 mhd issue a notice of project change npc propose a number of change to the surface road and transit element of the logan airport route 1a interchange as point out by appellee there be no fit between the effect of airport expansion that appellant wish to be study and the decision to be make by the fhwa the district court accept this evaluation find that it be sensible to conclude that the modest increase in height would be offset by move the highway away from the community in rule that defendant be entitle to judgment as a matter of law the district court first outline the numerous fact that be stipulate to by the party
33	33	198662.json	 the board thus remand the case instruct the alj to weigh and analyze the evidence far upon examination of the record in the instant case the board determine that there be evidence in the record which if find credible could support a finding of an aggravation injury and thereby entitle jones to increase benefit from permanent partial to permanent total disability benefit on may 3 1993 the alj find that no new injury have occur as of jones last date of employment february 15 1991 and that therefore there be no reason to adjust the date of the award the first issue be whether the benefits review board err in its august 12 1996 order vacate the alj 's opinion and remanding for determination of whether a new injury arise in february 1991 and the second be whether upon remand the alj err in find that a new injury occur on february 15 1991 petitioner appellant bath iron works inc. challenge a decision of the benefits review board of the united states department of labor office of workers compensation hold it responsible for the payment of ongoing medical benefit and a special fund assessment pursuant to the longshoremen and harbor workers compensation act lhwca 33 u.s.c. jones appeal the 1993 alj determination to the benefits review board claim that a new injury have occur as of february 15 1991 and that he be therefore entitle to benefit base upon his high average weekly salary at that time the board find that the alj have fail to discuss his reasoning for find no aggravation and accordingly remand for clarification of the issue the board find that the alj have not identify discuss or weigh the relevant evidence and that evidence exist which if credit could yield a finding of new injury as a result at the hearing the alj address the issue and bath iron works subsequently appeal his decision to the board bath iron works allege that the decision improperly assess it with liability for medical payment and the special fund assessment for all period after february 15 1991 because the board exceed its scope of review in the august 12 1996 opinion and the subsequent remand the alj award jones benefit for a permanent total disability base upon his salary as of february 15 1991 and grant the employer relief under 33 u.s.c. in this way the board have the authority to address the new injury issue under the aggravation theory next we determine whether the board err in remand the case to the alj on the aggravation issue the board concur find sufficient factual support in the record for the alj 's decision therefore it be disingenuous to allege that the issue be raise for the first time in the brief to the alj for the remand hearing jones respond that he file a section 922 petition for modification of benefit seek permanent total disability benefit which provide notice of his appeal and authorize the board to hear the aggravation claim and that the board 's remand be correct because it be necessary for the alj to determine whether there be evidence to support an aggravation of his injury the alj award jones permanent total disability benefit and once again recognize the employer 's right to relief pursuant to 33 u.s.c. see e.g. bank v. chicago grain trimmers assoc 390 u.s. 459 465 n.8 1968 note the fact that a petitioner label a second action as a claim for compensation rather than an application for review be irrelevant for statutory purpose as long as the action meet the requirement of the section moreover it maintain that the board err in remand the case to the alj because the remand effectively foreclose a true judicial determination by the alj the board determine that jones fulfil the statute of limitation requirement of the lhwca reason that because jones letter seek modification of benefit be timely file under 922 it be unnecessary for jones to take the additional step of file a new injury claim under 913 of the lwhca during the course of this employment he be expose to asbestos become ill and file for worker compensation benefit the board remand for specific factual determination and the alj find a new and discrete injury benefits review board remand order bath iron works contend that absent a prior claim for compensation allege a new injury the board do not possess the authority to address the issue for the first time upon appeal 1941 interpret term under the lhwca we find that jones letter satisfy the requirement of section 922 follow the board 's remand the alj analyze additional evidence and reverse his early decision on march 3 1997 in so do he first note that even though he have consider all of the evidence regard a new injury claim at the time of his original decision a new injury occur in february 1991 at this point our authority to review the decision of the benefits review board end petitioner at that time be receive permanent partial disability benefit and therefore satisfy the statutory time limit of section 922 the board far note that the proceeding under 922 if not the letter itself provide a timely alert that jones be assert a new injury claim under an aggravation theory on january 16 1981 an administrative law judge alj determine that jones have sustain an occupational disease asbestosis as a result of his work as a pipe coverer at the bath iron work shipyard additionally bath iron works maintain that the evidence fail to reasonably establish that a new injury occur as of february 15 1991 the combination of these factor lead the alj to conclude that a new injury arise on february 15 1991 and to award permanent total disability benefit accordingly on august 12 1996 the benefits review board hold that there be evidence that could result in a finding of new injury in 1991 908(f base upon a pre exist chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that the alj determined have combine with the occupational disease to create the disability then in november 1990 bath iron work change the location of jones workplace in

state court since the united states supreme court have exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the final judgment of the superior court the high court of new hampshire in which a decision could be have rooker feldman instruct that no federal court other than the united states supreme court have jurisdiction to entertain appellants federal claim moreover in the unusual situation in which no appellate court have jurisdiction to review the trial court 's judgment the writ of certiorari of the united states supreme court run to that trial court decide whether rooker feldman bar the plaintiff federal suit therefore require that we determine what the state court hold and whether the relief that the plaintiff request in their federal action would void the state court 's decision or

judgment as to walker pursuant to fed but if walker could have intervene without risk we think that it be far from clear that the husband decision foreclose liability technically the case do not

district court be the general reluctance of the law to impose affirmative duty to aid except in narrowly define situation base on special relationship e.g. parent child policeman citizen and the benefit of bright line in reduce litigation the court hold that the host now in danger herself and badly frightened could not have be expect to disarm the assaulter or to remain in the house and it say that the defendant 's warning to the plaintiff to flee be an adequate response to a very dangerous situation that have arise suddenly on the night of november 9 1997 doe go to a comedy club in boston massachusetts where she socialize with walker irvin and smith as well as two of walker 's teammate ronald mercer and chauncey billups whom doe have not previously meet the child be thereafter injure and the jury find the building owner liable for the wilful wanton or reckless conduct of its agent the standard deem to apply in the case of a trespasser and while the district court do not directly mention the opportunity for walker to halt the assault without risk to himself that be an inference at least as easy to draw in favor of doe as the other two still it be instructive to consider an old decision cite to we by neither of the party with egregious fact on december 18 1998 the district court grant walker 's motion to dismiss it reason that walker have no duty under massachusetts law to intervene or otherwise to protect doe from the assault by the other on may 14 1998 walker move to dismiss the claim against he on the ground that doe have fail to state a claim in such a case the statute give the district court discretion to decline jurisdiction over a supplemental state claim where as here it raise a novel or complex issue of state law however decision like pridgen do suggest that the sjc like most other court respond as much to fact as to abstraction and it confirm to we that further development of the fact in this case be well warrant before doe 's

group prepare to leave the club irvin tell doe that walker want she to visit he at his home this be the gist of the allegation in the complaint of course further evidence might reveal that walker could have do nothing to stop the assault but action range from tell the other to stop to call 911 present themselves as reasonable possibility as amend doe 's complaint assert claim against mercer irvin and billups under the violence against women act 42 u.s.c. far as irvin be himself live in the residence and extend the invitation this might mitigate any duty that walker might otherwise have have in uphold the verdict the sjc say that it do not matter that the defendant 's conduct could be describe simply as a failure to act 1988 where the defendant be sue when unexpectedly one of her two guest draw a knife state that she intend to kill the other guest and eventually inflict knife wound on the other guest the district court draw every possible inference in favor of doe base on the bare

that the defendant might have breach a duty to render aid once the knife attack have begin not prepared to say that prevail value and expectation require the defendant to be more vigilant of security to intervene directly or to summon assistance at the risk of serious personal injury to herself or of cause great danger to the plaintiff because the appeal be from a dismissal for failure to state a

mercer michael irvin chauncey billups defendants 260 2a and it be probably subject to the massachusetts one year tolling statute in any event w]e conclude as do the trial judge that the circumstance impose no duty on the defendant but we think that the massachusetts court have not clearly speak one way or the other and while they would surely give weight to concern about vigilantism they might on

facility cover by the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca 33 u.s.c. the alj also hold that the hardings facility be a cover situs under the act and that liberty mutual as the carrier at the time of the last exposure be liable for payment of the benefit 920(a in any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter it shall be presume in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary a that the claimant come within the provision of this chapter nonetheless there be policy argument to be make to support such an extension of an allocation rule in those situation where as here the employee work for the same employer throughout and be simply transfer by the employer from a cover facility where he be expose to a non covered facility brown appeal alj shatz 's ruling and on june 16 1992 the brb reverse the second alj do not have the issue of compensability before he and unsurprisingly his opinion do not even refer to 920(a on february 21 1990 a second alj shatz find that the only reliable audiogram be conduct in 1983 find the audiogram do in 1955 and 1967 be unreliable and that the 1983 audiogram could not be rely upon as an indicator of brown 's hearing loss in 1978 since brown be expose to loud noise at the hardings plant after that date if base on the record as a whole the evidence have be evenly balanced between brown and biw brown would have lose this issue do not need to be resolve because we have uphold the finding of compensability against biw arise out of brown 's 1941 to 1978 employment at the shipyard and commercial union concede at oral argument that if brown be entitle to compensation under the act the extent of such compensation could be base on the 1983 audiogram here however the presumption be not rebut and so brown be properly award compensation as a result the alj deny brown 's claim the basic attack mount by commercial union and biw be that the second alj find on substantial evidence that brown fail to produce credible evidence of any hearing loss during the cover period at the shipyard and that the brb be not free to disturb that rule brown jr et al respondents we decide this case on the ground argue by brown the first alj find that brown have adduce evidence sufficient to make out a prima facie case as to his hearing loss during his employment at the shipyard and consequently to invoke the presumption of liability in 33 u.s.c. the director office of workers compensation programs u.s. department of labor argue that this case should turn on an extension of the well accept last employer rule the context in which the rule arise be where it have already be determine that the claimant have a right to recover the issue be one of allocation and the last employer cover by the act be the last employer therefore the second alj conclude brown ha[d not sustain his burden of proof by credible evidence that he sustain a hearing loss prior to be transfer in 1978 from the employer 's shipyard to the hardings facility brown jr. now nearly 78 year old work at shipbuilding facility own by the bath iron works biw for 43 year from 1941 to 1984 he argue that the first alj find on substantial evidence both exposure to loud noise and hearing loss during the cover period and that the brb 's order should be affirm the nature of occupational disease and the dearth of medical certainty with respect to the time that be require for they to develop and the permanence and extent of the resultant injurious effect at different stage of the disease evolution make it exceedingly difficult if not practically impossible to correlate the progression of the disease with specific point in time or specific industrial experience the rule state that the employer during the last employment in which the claimant be expose to injurious stimulus prior to the date upon which the claimant become aware of the fact that he be suffer from an occupational disease arise naturally out of his employment be liable for the full amount of the award 717 761 62 1983 ii on july 22 1983 brown file a claim for compensation with the office of workers compensation u.s. department of labor the first alj rule incorrectly the brb later say that both of the biw facility where brown work be cover facility thus his focus be not primarily on whether the injury be cause or aggravate at the shipyard or at the hardings facility or both the employer do not rebut the presumption and the brb correctly determine that substantial evidence support the first alj 's determination if the presumption have be rebut by biw it would have fall out of the case and brown would have have to establish his burden base on the record as a whole since brown and biw could not agree on a settlement the dispute go before an alj of the department of labor upon reconsideration the board reaffirm this holding an explanation of our reasoning benefit from a description shorten and focused of the protract prior proceeding the board also decide that a]ggravation of a cover injury occur after termination of cover longshore employment be not compensable under the act under leach v. thompson 's dairy inc. 13 ben the original claim for compensation be file on july 22 1983 and the matter have be before three different administrative law judges alj and have be to the brb four time on june 11 1986 after the only evidentiary hearing hold in this matter alj glennon award brown benefit for a 39.6 binaural hearing loss base on expert testimony and audiogram take in 1955 1967 and 1983

purpose of the actor under the circumstance g solicit an innocent agent to engage in conduct constitute an element of the crime deny 507 u.s. 943 1993 or as the code frame the issue a substantial step in a course of conduct plan to culminate in the defendant 's commission of the crime in question the more difficult question be whether doyon 's effort to make the payoff constitute a substantial step toward the commission of the possession united states v. figueroa 976 f.2d 1446 1459 1st cir at sentencing the district court attribute to doyon the four ounce of cocaine that the court think doyon have attempt to buy and as relate conduct the three ounce he have purchase in late october it be true as doyon argue that evidence derive from the operation of a machine or instrument normally depend for its validity on the premise that the device be in proper working order but the nature and stringency of this requirement vary with the circumstance 841 846 and convict of the offense a person be guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if act with the kind of culpability otherwise require for commission of the crime he a purposely engage in conduct that would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstance be as he believe they to be or b when cause a particular result be an element of the crime do or omit to do anything with the purpose of cause or with the belief that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part or c purposely do or omit to do anything that under the circumstance as he believe they to be be an act or omission constitute a substantial step in a course of conduct plan to culminate in his commission of the crime indeed the government admit in court that the tape recorder be an old one that have to be operate manually and at least in this instance omit the first few second of both of the tape conversation that be introduce in evidence the district court although regard the issue as a close one deny the motion and the case be submit to the jury in consider the motion to acquit the district judge reject the notion that the jury could find that doyon have an intent to make a simultaneous purchase and in closing argument both lawyer invite the jury to focus on a different question namely whether in context doyon 's effort to pay off his drug debt could be regard as a substantial step toward a purchase in the near future and might therefore constitute a substantial step toward possession with intent to distribute under the code definition set forth in section 5.01 reprint as an appendix to this opinion we have view the two key element of the offense of attempt as 1 an intent to commit the substantive offense and 2 a substantial step towards its commission the difficult question be whether the conduct here doyon 's travel to the hotel with cash to pay off the prior debt be substantial in relation to reach the criminal goal within the meaning of this article renunciation of criminal purpose be not voluntary if it be motivate in whole or in part by circumstance not present or apparent at the inception of the actor 's course of conduct that increase the probability of detection or apprehension or that make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose 4b1.1 and after decline to depart impose the minimum sentence of 262 month we consider the issue in the same light and while agree that this could be regard as a close case uphold the refusal to direct a verdict both the code and instruction we have approve say that the substantial step must be one strongly corroborative of the actor 's criminal purpose one of his claim be that the evidence be insufficient to support the conviction so we set forth the fact in the light most favorable to the government however both our case law and the code 's specific example of conduct that may be find sufficient as a substantial step show that the defendant do not have to get very far along the line toward ultimate commission of the object crime in order to commit the attempt offense the case law say doyon usually involve conduct by defendant that bring he somewhat close to final commission of the object crime the law of attempt be reasonably clear in the center but quite fuzzy around the edge different formulation have be use to cope with a range of problem such as degree of involvement impossibility and withdrawal shortly thereafter at another location escobar sell three ounce of cocaine to doyon for approximately $ 3,300 the drug be fronted to doyon mean that he pay an extra amount per ounce but do not have to pay escobar up front a practice that be common in deal between drug trafficker on appeal doyon 's attack on the evidence rest on the premise that doyon could not have intend to accept the new delivery at the same time that he pay off his old debt because escobar have say early that he do not have any drug and that the payment of an old debt as a first step in secure a later delivery be not the substantial step toward possession require to make out an attempt this appear to be just such a case the key admission on the tape be doyon 's express desire to purchase four to ten ounce of cocaine his intent to pay off his old debt as a predicate and his plan to meet promptly with escobar at the hotel in this circuit as in a number of other the court have take the model penal code as its guide thus the conviction be proper and while the sentence be certainly severe federal sentencing be largely outside the control of federal judge in the case of record conversation some court have a recipe for this showing e.g. united states v. mcmillan 508 f.2d 101 104 8th cir doyon have a prior relationship with his wholesaler he have make a prior purchase on credit he be pay off the first debt as a condition of make a second purchase from the same wholesaler and his plan to acquire more drug be specific down to the quantity of drug be seek at 12:30 p.m. about half an hour after the first call escobar act under the government 's supervision page doyon and a second telephone conversation ensue base on evidence not present to the jury it appear that doyon may well have expect to make an immediate purchase but of course our concern be solely with what the jury could reasonably have find on the evidence before it thus no basis exist to suppose that the tape be misleading at all let alone that the district judge abuse his discretion in reject the objection escobar then agree to cooperate and while give a statement receive a pager signal from doyon and return doyon 's call in the presence of government agent peter e. rodway by appointment of the court for appellant it be this purpose that inform the judgment whether a specific act or act in context and couple with proof of intent can be regard as substantial and it help explain the code 's otherwise confusing conflation of intent and conduct in define what be a substantial step the case often involve somewhat more robust fact but the defendant 's arrival at the scene ready to commit the crime have be find adequate to constitute a substantial step in a number of case deny 421 u.s. 916 1975 but this circuit have simply require proof that the tape recording accurately reflect the conversation in question such judgment as to which the trial judge have considerable latitude united states v. font ramirez 944 f.2d 42 47 1st cir 1991 require a certain amount of imagination wherever the exact content of the omit portion be unknown in the second conversation doyon and escobar agree to meet at the hotel at around 5 p.m. escobar ask doyon whether he have all the money and doyon reply of course in this case doyon 's intent to acquire cocaine be difficult to dispute and doyon do not now challenge the inference that he intend to distribute what he get when the actor 's conduct would otherwise constitute an attempt under subsection 1)(b or 1)(c of this section it be an affirmative defense that he abandon his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevent its commission under circumstance manifest a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose too ready classification of an otherwise lawful act as a substantial step may capture someone who might well have think well and abandon the effort before the attempt flower into the substantive crime 1993 cert 1994 cert at some point thereafter doyon call escobar at the hotel and say that he have the money he owe escobar from the prior deal and want to meet he 1974 cert 1992 cert prior to trial doyon have seek unsuccessfully to suppress the tape recording but i]f there be separate evidence of criminal intent independent from that provide by the substantial step e.g. a confess admission of a design to commit a crime then the substantial step need not themselves be unequivocally indicative of criminal intent they must merely corroborate that intent

fact answer this question require we to strike a balance between the interest of the teacher as a citizen in comment upon matter of public concern and the interest of the state as an employer in promote the efficiency of the public service it perform through its employee over the course of the semester breitborde become concerned about the appellant 's unusually forceful espousal at inappropriate time of religiously orient view on subject such as homosexuality and abortion e.g. his submission of a paper wrap in a picture of a fetus even though the paper have nothing to do with reproductive right 1983 1985(3 and 1986 the appellant sue a throng of defendant give the appellant the benefit of the doubt see supra we treat his conduct and expression of opprobrium as involve matter of public concern i.e. an intent to comment on the public school curriculum as justice marshall phrase it the expression should not be consider in a vacuum the manner time and place of the employee 's expression be relevant as be the context in which the dispute arise we hold therefore that the appellant be not constitutionally entitle to a hearing regard his removal for academic reason from the teacher certification program that datum however fail to negate the inescapable fact that delucia eventually dismiss he from the practicum the successful completion of which be a prerequisite to certification in january of 1996 salem state act with breitborde 's approval place the appellant at the horace mann elementary school melrose massachusetts for a student teaching practicum and assign he to assist richard mcdermod in instruct a fourth grade class we therefore conclude as a matter of law that the appellant 's statement to everson while touch on matter of public concern do not outweigh the school 's considerable interest as an employer in guard against the impairment of relation among teacher the appellant reject this characterization challenge the propriety of permit such activity to occur in the public school and remain adamant about the moral correctness of his position here the material fact what the appellant say and do during the everson family fiesta night and regard art incident and what he say when delucia call he onto the carpet be mostly admit although the appellant strain to put a more favorable spin on they and the few detail that be controvert do not alter the decisional calculus this tenet remain valid and this case in which the melrose defendant state concern over the serial incident involve the appellant have nothing to do with the content of the appellant 's statement and everything to do with the time place and manner in which he communicate his sentiment come within its heartland in any case the claim to such a property interest be dubious see ewing 474 u.s. at 229 powell j. concurring and in this case it seem especially tenuous because salem state do not expel the appellant but merely preclude he from continue in a particular program and because the approve methodology for assess the teaching competency set by the mdoe explicitly require the certify institution to evaluate a fledgling teacher 's interpersonal skill the appellant 's inability to communicate effectively with his colleague at horace mann and his unwillingness to work within the prescribe curriculum reasonably could have as much influence on salem state from an academic standpoint as say his ability to prepare a lesson plan in this regard the appellant complain that the reason delucia give for terminate the practicum involve his conduct not his competence and thus be disciplinary in nature the district judge in pass upon the sufficiency of the melrose defendant proof that the protect activity be not a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to dismiss the appellant draw a distinction between constitutionally protect expression and the job relate effect of that expression we conclude therefore that the employer employee model furnish the good analogy here and that the case law deal with the first amendment in the government employment context rather than the public school student context provide the appropriate framework for our inquiry we have canvass the record carefully and have confirm that factual dispute do exist e.g. the appellant claim that when he storm out of the regard art activity he repair to the school 's computer room to work on a tutorial assignment whereas the defendant claim that he leave the premise the appellant also deny that he call delucia the devil to her face whereas she insist that he do on may 15 salem state send he a letter advise that he have a fail his student teaching practicum due to the premature termination of his placement and b fail to meet four of the common teaching competency communication skill self- evaluation equity and professionalism require for certification by the massachusetts department of education mdoe for ease in reference we divide they into moiety delucia and the city of melrose collectively the melrose defendant on one hand and the commonwealth and numerous salem state hierarchs collectively the salem state defendant on the other here although the appellant 's remark relate in part to the curriculum a matter of admit public concern they simultaneously evince a level of intransigence and insubordination that no employer should be compel to tolerate where as here an apprentice teacher elect a mode of communication audible denigration and visible petulance in the learn environment in front of student and other that plainly conflict with the school 's legitimate interest in require full participation in the designate curriculum the constitutional balance tip sharply in the employer 's favor on the afternoon of april 1 delucia instruct the appellant to meet with the school superintendent the appellant contact the appropriate college official and learn the nature of the charge who have make they and how the hearing process work see connick 461 u.s. at 151 52 when close work relationship be essential to fulfil public responsibility a wide degree of deference to the employer 's judgment be appropriate in march the situation begin to deteriorate it assume that the first amendment safeguard some of the activity describe by delucia in her communique to salem state but rule that the record compel the conclusion that the appellant 's job performance rather than his protect speech prompt the melrose defendant decision when a teacher reject constructive criticism vilify the principal and openly challenge her power to set ground rule for professional conduct that teacher jeopardize the successful and efficient operation of the institution dr. john mangini a salem state faculty member responsible for evaluate the appellant 's performance at horace mann report during the initial stage of the practicum that he be do well the appellant term the display disgusting brand the cesaro paint obscene and storm out of the class the anti- abortion sentiment express by the appellant during that tte-- tte clearly relate to a subject of political controversy and hence public concern when salem state remove the appellant from the certification program it advance two reason 1 he receive a fail grade in his practicum and 2 he have not satisfy four of the common teaching competency require for certification by the mdoe against this backdrop we have little difficulty conclude that the school 's strong interest in preserve a collegial atmosphere harmonious relation among teacher and respect for the curriculum while in the classroom outweigh the appellant 's interest in proselytize for his choose cause in an abundance of caution however we assume for argument 's sake that the appellant possess a constitutionally protect property interest in complete the teacher certification program we therefore restrict our discussion to the appellant 's two most promising assertion namely 1 that the melrose defendant violate his first amendment right and 2 that the salem state defendant abridge his fourteenth amendment right to procedural due process the mere fact that the appellant 's conduct carry both disciplinary and academic implication do not without more transform the character of salem state 's action or support the inference that the college use its academic decisionmake power as a back door to achieve disciplinary goal background in accord with the summary judgment standard we limn the fact as hospitably to the appellant 's claim as the record permit indulge all reasonable inference in his favor the appellant maintain that his expressive conduct in both instance relate at least in some degree to his view on the public school curriculum the supreme court however have show a preference for a different analytic methodology one which incorporate consideration of the job relate effect of expression into the logically antecedent question of whether the expression be protect in the first place analysis summary judgment be appropriate where t]he pleading deposition answer to interrogatory and admission on file together with the affidavit if any show that there be no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the move party be entitle to a judgment as a matter of law see waters 511 u.s. at 676 state that of necessity public employer often do rely on hearsay on past similar conduct and on their personal knowledge of people 's credibility and that such reliance if reasonable do not contravene the first amendment still the district court determine this case on summary judgment and under that appellant- friendly standard we be reluctant wholly to discount hennessy 's suggestion that he intend to express principled disapproval of the curriculum through his hegira and that those

58	58	198691.json	 this say the town preclude a finding of privity neither party have pursue this latter claim on appeal but the town have appeal from the dismissal of its claim for environmental harm to its citizen because of the inadequate remediation specifically the failure to extend the water line in 1998 subsequent to the dismissal of the state court action the town bring a diversity action against the defendant in the federal district court in maine ground not in the state environmental statute but instead in state common law claim of trespass negligence nuisance and strict liability in this case the defendant be allegedly responsible for the discharge between 1939 and 1976 of gasoline from underground storage equipment at their service station in the town of boothbay maine the town into the surround groundwater 1998 seek reimbursement for the cost of cleanup and remediation of the affected area the magistrate judge grant summary judgment on this claim in favor of the defendant reason that the same claim for environmental damage be previously bring and settle by the state and that the town be bind by this resolution because the issue be re judicata and the town be in privity with the state in 1990 the state discover that the contamination have spread to surround well and bring suit against the defendant in maine superior court pursuant to several state environmental statute see i d. yet in this case the town assert a claim for relief which be not supplemental to but rather the same as that previously bring by the state 1998 and nothing suggest that the legislature want to give other the opportunity to bring the same environmental enforcement claim where the state have already do so a central demand by the state be that the defendant finance an extension of the water line from the town 's water supply to the contaminated property this appeal concern the question whether under maine law the doctrine of re judicata bar a town from sue a private party for environmental damage affect the town 's water supply insofar as the state have previously litigate and settle claim of environmental damage against the same private party for the same environmental harm the legislature have empower the department of environmental protection to enforce its environmental law see i 1998 the defense of re judicata be inapplicable in this context the maine department of environmental protection the state subsequently discover the contamination and begin cleanup effort on this appeal the town mount two attack on the magistrate 's finding that the claim for environmental damage be bar by re judicata 98 125 p dmc mem the town evidently do not learn of the settlement until after it occur but it be aware of the state 's lawsuit and opt not to intervene the town 's second argument be that because the state environmental statute under which the state bring the early action reserve to municipality and other a right against the state environmental fund as well as a right to bring their own lawsuit see i partway into the litigation however the state determine that other remediation scheme would obviate the need for a water line extension it thus drop its demand for a water line extension and settle with the defendant for a lump sum payment calculate to cover the alternative remediation cost the town 's first argument be that there be a divergence of interest between the state and the town such that the former do not adequately represent the latter 's interest in restore a clean water supply to the contaminated area because the state be only interested in recoup expense that it have incur the most significant component of relief seek by the town be for the same water line extension previously seek by the state however it appear from the record that the state vigorously pursue the demand that the defendant finance a water line extension until it determine that alternative measure would adequately solve the contamination problem as to that claim the magistrate judge hold that it be not bar by re judicata but that the amount be insufficient to meet the jurisdictional minimum so the claim should be dismiss without prejudice dec. 7 1998 to which we add only a few brief comment address to the specific issue raise on this appeal a detailed description of background fact and issue be set forth in the magistrate judge 's thorough opinion below see town of boothbay v. getty oil co. civ appeal from the united states district court for the district of maine hon the lawsuit be subsequently dismiss with prejudice 38 347 a 541 60 561 70 g west 1989 amp supp the town fail to point to any fact in support of its contention that the state act in bad faith or unreasonably and its say so be insufficient to make out a showing of misaligned interest or inadequate representation see generally restatement second of judgments 41 cmt 38 541 561 west 1989 amp supp it be true that the determination whether a party be deem in privity with the state and thus bar from bring supplemental claim against a defendant subsequent to a suit bring by the state be affect by the legislature 's implicit or explicit

time of england 's injury for the tending of line to be do by the ship the tugboat or in certain case the barge agent and that longshoreman do not have responsibility for tend line regard reinauer 's duty to intervene england present evidence that a custom exist in the port of boston encompass the charlestown moran terminal that the tug crew not only initially moor the barge to the pier possibly with the help of line handler hire by the barge company but also inspect and adjust the mooring line before cargo loading operation begin as well as during break in the longshoreman 's work captain weber state that on the day of england 's injury the tug crew check the mooring line at approximately 8:00 a.m. just before the longshoreman begin work and that although they do not undertake a formal check during the longshoreman 's 10:00 break when he leave the tug at approximately 10:30 to make a phone call in the terminal he be able to view the line along the barge and determine that everything look fine shortly thereafter the line attach the stern of the barge to the pier burst strike england fracture his kneecap and render he disable as a longshoreman follow the close of england 's case in chief reinauer make a motion which it renew several time thereafter for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative a new trial contending inter alia that the evidence be insufficient to establish that it owe england any duty and that the court have err by exclude evidence of england 's collateral source benefit fourth and most telling frederick weber captain of the tug state that on his few dozen trip into the moran terminal tow unmanned barge the tug crew would secure the barge to the pier upon arrival inspect the line before the cargo operation begin and recheck the line while the longshoreman be on break when a case be be hear in federal court the evidentiary as oppose to the substantive aspect of the collateral source rule be govern by the federal rules of evidence particularly rule 401 402 and 403 1985 in which the massachusetts supreme judicial court uphold the introduction of evidence of collateral source benefit when the victim 's motivation be a genuine issue at trial to contradict the victim 's extensive testimony of the lack of money that he experience as a result of his injury give that the hale england agreement do not fall into the mary carter category the issue reveal itself to be the simple question of whether the court abuse its considerable discretion by refuse to force hale and england to disclose the term of its post trial agreement to reinauer the court and the jury the supreme court have however in scindia steam navigation co. v. de los santos 451 u.s. 156 1981 provide guidance as to the main attribute of a shipowner 's duty to longshoreman for example on october 5 the second day of trial england 's counsel inform the court and all party in chamber that england have reach a tentative settlement with hale but that its finalization be dependent on the court 's ruling on hale 's motion in limine to exclude from evidence a contract between hale and reinauer see scindia steam 451 u.s. at 167 state that the vessel owner may be liable if it fail to exercise due care to avoid expose longshoreman to harm from hazard they may encounter in area or from equipment under the active control of the vessel see also torres v. johnson lines 932 f.2d 748 750 9th cir 1994 state that post-'turnover duty may arise if the vessel owner be obligate by contract statute or custom to monitor stevedore operation for the purpose of detect and remedy unsafe condition kirsch v. plovidba 971 f.2d 1026 1031 3rd cir second because it be endorse on october 13 after the case have be submit to the jury the settlement can not be guilty of alter the party behavior during trial third under the duty to intervene the shipowner have a duty only if contract provision positive law or custom dictate by way of supervision or inspection that the shipowner exercise reasonable care to discover dangerous condition that develop within the confine of the cargo operation that be assign to the stevedore we review the court 's denial of reinauer 's motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo but we examine the evidence and the inference to be extract therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant and may reverse the denial of such a motion only if reasonable person could not have reach the conclusion that the jury embrace 1967 and although it have be characterize many way can be summarize as an agreement in which 1 the liability of the settle defendant be limit and the plaintiff be guarantee a minimum recovery 2 the settling defendant remain a party to the pende action without disclose the full agreement to the nonsettle defendant and/or the judge and jury and 3 if judgment against the nonsettle defendant be for more than the amount of settlement any money collect will first offset the settlement so that the settle defendant may ultimately pay nothing third england represent that the agreement establish a settle sum not contingent on the jury 's verdict england state that on occasion he have be inform by the crane operator that the line be slack and the barge be pull away from the pier and that upon the relay of that information to the tug crew the crew would tighten the line at approximately 8:00 a.m. just before the longshoreman be to begin unload the barge the tug crew inspect the mooring line we note that reinauer do not allege that the evidence be insufficient to support finding that the element of negligence other than the duty be establish captain weber testify that by inspect the mooring line he mean that the tug crew would walk over and check on they to make sure that they be not too tight that the barge be up against the dock secure in place and it be safe for people to come back and forth first the shipowner have a turnover duty to warn the longshoreman of hazard from gear equipment tool and workspace to be use in cargo operation t]hat be know to the ship or should be know to it in the exercise of reasonable care that case however be not bring under the lhwca because it do not involve a longshoreman 's claim and therefore the scindia steam outline of a shipowner 's duty to longshoreman be not applicable between 10:30 and 10:45 the tug 's captain leave the boat to make a phone call and testify that from the bow of the barge he view the entire row of mooring line tie the barge to the pier third matthew crimson barge operation manager for hale agree that it be consistent with his experience in the port of boston that the tug crew maintain mooring line see e.g. john e. benedict note it be a mistake to tolerate the mary carter agreement 87 colum as we have already explain the timing of the settlement be such that it do not alter the relationship between the party and thus disclosure of its term to reinauer or the court be unnecessary although reinauer argue that it have no duty to continuously monitor the condition of the mooring line and make adjustment as cargo operation be occur an abundance of evidence lend itself to a finding that it be a custom in the port of boston for the tug crew to inspect and adjust the mooring line before the cargo loading operation begin and during break in the work england contend that the mooring line be within the exclusive control of the tug crew and barge agent as evidence by the tug crew 's morning inspection of the line on the day of the accident captain weber 's mid morning check of the line the vessel crew 's admit practice of review the line at certain interval and the longshoreman 's lack of knowledge about the tending of mooring line england 's testimony in this case however be not sufficient to imply that he be suffer such financial difficulty as to negate impliedly the receipt of any additional benefit due to the accident and thus do not open the door for the introduction of his collateral source benefit in scindia steam the court outline the application of 905(b to relation between a longshoreman and a vessel owner and place the primary responsibility for avoid accident on the stevedore because he be in the good possible position to avoid accident during cargo operation finally regardless of whether reinauer 's motion for disclosure of the term of the hale england post trial settlement agreement be categorize as a discovery request because it seek disclosure to itself and to the court or an evidentiary request because it seek disclosure to the jury the court 's disposition of the motion be commit to its sound discretion the fifth circuit hold without citation that although custom itself do not create a duty it might be relevant to the standard of care once a duty have be find to exist he comment that on the date of the accident he have not make any particular note of the line and indeed he do not have the skill to observe whether a line be too tight or too slack regardless of fault the longshoreman 's employer must compensate the injure worker and his or her family with medical disability and death benefit generally the vessel owner have the right to expect that the stevedore will perform his task safely and properly without supervision of the ship in june 1996 longshoreman joseph england be seriously injure when a mooring line binding a barge to the pier on which he be work burst and strike he in the knee second the vessel be liable for a breach of its active control duty if it actively involve itself in the cargo operation and negligently injure a longshoreman or if it fail to exercise due care to avoid expose longshoreman to harm from hazard they may encounter in area or from equipment under the active control of the vessel during the stevedoring operation 1989 state that the trial court have broad discretion in determine the scope of discovery united states v. cardales 168 f.3d 548 557 1st cir regard the turnover duty england concede that a breach of this duty be not a possible basis for the jury 's verdict we review the court 's denial of reinauer 's alternative request for a new trial for an abuse of discretion recognize that the trial judge may set aside a jury 's verdict only if he or she believe that the outcome be against the clear weight of the evidence such that uphold the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice when such evidence be relevant to some other contest issue however it may be admit if it be not unfairly prejudicial the risk of unfair prejudice from the admission of this type of evidence must be weigh carefully because a jury inform say that a plaintiff have recourse to first party insurance proceed may be unduly inclined to return either a defendant 's verdict or an artificially low damage award england maintain that he have never be rely upon to attach tighten or slacken line and that the responsibility have always be assign exclusively to the tugboat crew and the barge agent on june 25 1996 england a longshoreman employ by p&amp;w marine service be oversee a gang of twelve longshoreman unload and then load cargo onto a barge the norfolk trader moreover it be doubtful that the court would have inform the juror of the term of the settlement since they have already enter deliberation require they to specify the degree of fault of each party reinauer rely on fitzgerald in which the court uphold the admission of collateral source benefit evidence when the victim 's mother testify that the medical bill result from the victim 's accident have financially strain the family the line handler be employ by hale for the limited purpose of assist with the mooring and unmooring of the barge but be not on site during cargo operation moreover the court note when prevent reinauer from inquire into england 's collateral source benefit on cross examination that the jury be likely aware that england be receive worker compensation benefit c. disclosure of the hale england settlement agreement finally reinauer contend that the court 's denial of its post judgment motion for disclosure of the term of the settlement agreement between hale and england be error because the agreement be a mary carter agreement and thus unfairly prejudicial to reinauer

61	61	198694.json	 prior to the suit be file john carota a structural engineering expert give samos imex a report evaluate the condition of the building recommend repair and identify the probable cause of the damage to the building and the freight elevator in the same motion nextel seek summary judgment on the separate ground that the report even if believe do not establish that the antenna have more likely than not cause the harm complain of rather accord to nextel the report dwelt solely in could have and possibility p. 26(a)(2)(b such as exhibit to be use at trial by the expert a list of his publication disclosure of compensation and a list of other case in which the expert have testify within the precede four year in the hearing counsel for samos imex respond to the court that carota would testify that when he use the phrase the probable cause in his report he mean more likely than not it reject the request to exclude the engineering report as a sanction for violation of discovery rule but it enter summary judgment on the ground that the report do not purport to establish that more probably than not the antenna construction be the cause of the damage the threshold of proof that the court say be inherent in the preponderance of the evidence standard that generally apply in civil case but the main use of these phrase which occur in the same paragraph as the probable cause statement be actually reference to multiple cause all of which relate to the construction or operation of the antenna and for all of which nextel would likely be responsible absent some further explanation to establish the latter plaintiff must show that it be more probable than not that the injury be cause by the action or event or a combination of they for which the defendant be responsible the gist of the complaint be that in 1995 nextel have construct an antenna or monopole over 100 foot high within several foot of a building lease and occupy by samos imex under a lease that require samos imex to make repair to the building in all event counsel for the plaintiff make an immediate proffer that the expert would testify that the monopole be more likely than not the cause of the injury and that that be what he have intend by use of the phrase probable cause in the report nor do this appear to be a case in which the expert be talk generally about why building collapse without reach a conclusion as to why this specific building have shift on the contrary the pivotal sentence in the probable cause section of the report quote above speak of the probable cause of the shifting of this three story brick building nextel ask we to affirm the district court 's decision on a distinct alternative ground namely the alleged failure of nextel to comply with discovery rule by furnish required information about the expert in effect nextel be ask we to conclude that there be a violation of the discovery rule and that it be of such a character as to compel the district court to exclude the report as a sanction for this violation when a magistrate judge speak of probable cause in a suppression hearing we assume that he mean a reasonable basis sufficient to satisfy the fourth amendment but if a doctor testify on the stand that the probable cause of death be a heart attack he might be expect to mean that the heart attack be more likely than not the cause of death the phrase probable cause be use in the narrow confine of fourth amendment precedent to establish a standard less demanding than more probable than not this document which be prepare in advance of the litigation be the only disclosure of anticipate expert testimony make by samos imex by the time of the discovery deadline for plaintiff 's expert testimony in august 1998 the district court hear oral argument and decide the matter from the bench but it be hard to justify dismissal of a case on summary judgment base on what be at bad ambiguous language in the face of an explicit proffer by counsel that the witness mean just what many reader would expect the witness to have intend the court say that it understand the proffer to mean that if carota be call to the stand he would answer that more likely than not the shifting of the building which cause the elevator to bind be cause by the nextel pole samos imex now appeal and review the grant of summary judgment de novo see cadle co. v. hayes 116 f.3d 957 960 1st cir the standard be obviously high at trial where in a civil suit for negligence the plaintiff must normally show both fault and causation however the court say that to accept this proffer as modify the report would undermine proper case management and discovery rule and that the report itself remain inadequate give the require standard admittedly far in the carota report he use phrase like could have cause and the like and nextel press this point on appeal and layman and many judge might easily refer to such a cause as the probable cause of an accident mean that it be the more likely than not cause in all event on remand the district court be free to enforce its discovery rule by order compliance sanction or any other appropriate remedy at one point in the transcript the district court appear squarely to have reject such a claim of violation as the basis for exclude carota 's testimony hardly a choice comprise a patent abuse of discretion nextel be free to depose carota to clarify his could have reference but it be not entitle to summary judgment on the present state of the record the judgment of the district court be reverse and the matter remand for further proceeding consistent with this opinion can be directly attribute to the building respond to the effect of construct the monopole project it be one thing to allow counsel to contradict by proffer something the expert say in the report or to supply a manifest omission in that event case management and discovery concern would be legitimate objection see e.g. forlano v. hughes 471 n.e.2d 1315 1319 20 mass. so long as nextel be responsible for all of the possible cause it would not matter whether the precise causal path could be identify there may well be more to the story but we can only act on what the record disclose 1997 we reverse if the doctor mean only that a heart attack be merely one possible cause among other it would be up to the oppose counsel to draw this out on cross examination see e.g. colantuonis v. alfred calcagni amp sons inc. 44 f.3d 1 5 1st cir see e.g. united states v. garcia 179 f.3d 265 269 5th cir but where a building incur harm after significant nearby construction and an expert call the construction the probable cause we think that more be need to support summary judgment than an easily resolve doubt as to whether the expert mean more probable than not if there be any doubt it would be easy enough to conduct a brief deposition of the witness samos imex claim that the antenna which itself involve subsurface construction have cause samos imex 's building to shift result in structural damage and render its freight elevator inoperative 98 2126 samo imex corporation plaintiff appellant v. nextel communications inc defendant

that exclusion of evidence be a standard sanction for a violation of duty of disclosure under rule 26(a but this be far from say that the district court be obligate to exclude evidence base on a failure long before trial and likely subject to correction without much harm to the oppose party nor do we know whether there may be some justification for any failure to disclose united states v.

62	62	198695.json	 although this provision might appear to channel judicial intervention in all deportation matter to the court of appeal the supreme court conclude that section 242(g govern only three specific decision by the attorney general namely to commence proceedings adjudicate case and execute removal order american arab 119 s. ct at 943 the much hard question in this case be whether the ban on waiver as that ban be enlarge by aedpa 440(d should be apply to those who like wallace and lemos be already in deportation proceeding prior to the enactment of aedpa but have not yet seek a section 212(c waiver after all elsewhere in the new statute congress give detailed direction both way as to immediate or deferred application of new provision in some case it order immediate application see e.g. aedpa 413(g 421(b in other only prospective application see e.g. aedpa 435(b 440(e f 441(b the supreme court 's surprisingly narrow reading of section 242(g compare goncalves 144 f.3d at 122 certainly do not encourage we to enlarge the reach of that section 101 649 511(a 104 stat to the contrary the government have argue that wallace be not in deportation proceeding until after aedpa 's enactment because although the ins issue an order to show cause to wallace in march 1996 before aedpa 's enactment that order to show cause be not file with the office of the immigration judge until june 14 1996 after aedpa become law pertinently the amendment be design to limit even beyond immact the attorney general 's authority to waive deportation for certain felon and by complementary jurisdictional change congress seek to curtail judicial review especially for this same class of felon against this background we think that there be good reason absent a contrary direction from congress to apply the pre aedpa scope of waiver to deportation proceeding already in progress at the time of aedpa 's enactment 98 2317 the appellee be tasfa wallace a native of jamaica who enter this country as an immigrant on may 10 1988 the government say that even as narrow in american arab section 242(g do apply to wallace although not to lemos because wallace seek not only his release but also a stay of deportation these other circuit stress the fact that congress consider a proposal to mandate immediate application but do not enact it but at least in the present context compare lindh v. murphy 521 u.s. 320 326 30 1997 we think this be a pretty thin basis for inferring that it intend the opposite the circuit have disagree about how these term should be apply to the enlarged ban compare mayers 175 f.3d at 1303 with requena rodriguez 1999 wl 717367 at 6 5th cir in wallace the district court take the view that wherever an alien plead guilty prior to aedpa the alien might have rely on the availability of a waiver and so the broaden aedpa waiver ban should never apply in such a case 1998 cert finally consistency favor a result that be thus far uniform among the circuit see note 7 above except the seventh circuit lemos concede deportability on september 24 1996 and seek a waiver of deportation under section 212(c of the ina as it exist before april 24 1996 as codify at 8 u.s.c. the district court judge keeton dismiss the habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction find that a contrary position take by this court affirm habeas jurisdiction in goncalves v. reno 144 f.3d 110 123 1st cir however until congress revamp the judicial review provision once again or the supreme court provide further guidance goncalve stand and habeas jurisdiction be available to both lemos and wallace thus the government 's well argument be that section 2241 be a general grant of jurisdiction to issue habeas petition but that the new immigration statute read together should be treat as an imply prohibition on habea as to deportation in general because congress mean to preclude any judicial intervention where a person be deportable by reason of specify offense and with respect to other deportee mean to channel judicial review into narrowly circumscribe proceeding in the court of appeal subject to specific time limit trigger by entry of the final order to maintain habea in the face of section 242(g but deny the ancillary relief need to make it meaningful would be to strain at the gnat after swallow the camel 99 1596 the appellant be carlos lemos a native of

1998 the district court judge gertner grant the petition agree with wallace that the limitation could not be apply to he because aedpa have not yet be enact when he plead guilty in his underlie criminal case at the threshold of both appeal be the question whether habeas be available to those who like lemos and wallace be subject to iirira 's transitional rule because proceeding to deport they begin prior to april 1 1997 of course the stay issue be arguably moot since the district court have grant the writ on the other hand the change could certainly have a direct and in some measure predictable impact on their interest in avoid deportation under the old ina deportation order be reviewable directly in the court of appeal see 8 u.s.c. as for iirira it contain further change to the waiver rule but we ignore those change here because iirira explicitly provide that only its transitional rule and not the new waiver and other permanent provision apply to proceeding like lemos 's commence before april 1 1997 after lemos 's deportation proceeding have begin but before it be complete congress enact two new statute amend the ina these amendment commonly reduce to the acronym aedpa and iirira be enact on april 24 1996 and september 30 1996 respectively see e.g. landgraf v. usi film prods 511 u.s. 244 261 1994 on december 18 1996 wallace concede deportability and indicate

other case and nothing in american arab be to the contrary on february 12 1999 lemos petition for habeas corpus in the district court pursuant to 28 u.s.c. as a result the immigration and naturalization service ins begin deportation proceeding against lemos on august 16 1995 in this case we be not concerned with ins 's internal time table start point due date and the like but with the judicial question of retroactivity iirira be pass while their case be on appeal and the attorney general argue that the injunction seek be prohibit by an iirira provision effective at once see iirira 306(c)(1 that limited judicial intervention for alien regardless of when their deportation proceeding begin the limited scope of section 242(g and its aim to protect against premature review of discretionary determination be specifically stress but the government say that a cryptic passage in american arab 119 s. ct at 945 make the whole case subject to section 242(g because it include a request for a stay 4978 5052 2241(c rather the government argue that this quote language be simply a limitation on habea and that there be no affirmative authority to grant habea in immigration case both because congress specifically repeal the grant which exist in the old ina and because congress intend to curtail habea in favor of very limited direct review as confirm by new ina section 242 99 1596 carlos alberto lemos petitioner appellant v. immigration and naturalization service respondent appellee this latter request say the government be a direct interference with the attorney general

corpus jurisdiction wherever a person be hold in violation of the constitution or law or treaty of the united states 28 u.s.c. aug. 16 1999
63	63	198696.json	 specifically the district court find the following as to some or all of the plaintiff that most of the plaintiff have believe for decade that david lombard have steal the lombard lot as for the plaintiff motion to amend to assert a quiet title claim under the quiet title act the court hold that the amendment would be futile because the claim of the plaintiff and several additional heir who have intervene be bar by the twelve year statute of limitation govern section 2409a in that event it would not necessarily suggest that the government be claim ownership of the lot itself and provide a key to the gate would be consistent with recognize an easement over the road to reach the lombard lot cf and sell it to higgins and i]n light of the widespread family knowledge of the sale to higgins over such a long period of time they could easily have learn the status of the property by make inquiry that some of the plaintiff recall learning of the cape cod national seashore in the 1960 and that most know that the united states have acquire the brook bound sic island property for that purpose the cape cod national seashore and that the plaintiff do not pay property taxis on the land surround the cemetery do not maintain that land do not occupy it and do not assert ownership to the national park service or the town of wellfleet but at most occasionally visit the family cemetery pick blueberry and have picnic on the adjacent property elsewhere in the opinion the district court note that the government have erect a locked gate somewhere on the road to the family cemetery see lombard 28 f. supp.2d at 49 50 and there be also an indication in the record that at some point tree grow up around the road make it difficult for car to pass the plaintiff claim through two of the three child of thomas lombard who have not convey their interest to higgins assert that the lombard descendant still own 60 percent of the lombard lot as tenant in common with the united states and seek to partition their interest for example if the gate be just at the property line of the lombard lot this might support an inference that the government be claim ownership of the lot thereafter privy of the plaintiff bring a new suit assert title to the western portion the subject of the dismiss suit and the court hold that the new suit could not be bring because the original 1958 order of the land court make clear that the dismissal of the sever action be intend to be without prejudice it would not normally result in claim preclusion see restatement second of judgments 20 1982 and since no fact be actually resolve in the case at all there can not be issue preclusion under ordinary doctrine the district court point to two other set of fact that a number of plaintiff think that the lombard lot have be steal by higgins long ago and that the heir do not pay property taxis maintain the lot live there assert ownership or visit it except occasionally the district court 's finding that as early as the 1960s most of the plaintiff know that the united states have acquire the brook bound sic island property for that purpose could be take as a reference to the lombard lot itself in 1962 higgins agree to sell the lombard lot to the united states all of it not just a 40 percent interest and the deed be record in the barnstable county registry of deeds on december 31 1962 one of thomas lombard 's grandson appear in the suit claim an interest and at higgins 's request the suit so far as it pertain to the lombard lot be sever from the rest in august 1964 the court confirm higgins 's title subject to the lombard family 's ownership of the cemetery and an easement to visit it the court then confirm higgins 's title to the other land but the sever case involve the lombard lot remain dormant until 1958 when it be order dismiss without prejudice through apparent error the dismissal order be not properly docket and in 1976 the land court sua sponte docket an order dismiss the sever case for lack of prosecution at least some of the plaintiff know that the gate be under the government 's control one of the plaintiff have complain and the government have provide a key to the gate although it do not remove the barrier the statute read if the court find that the plaintiff have not title proper for registration a judgment shall be enter dismiss the complaint and such judgment may be order to be without prejudice in whole or in part but unless so order it shall bind the party their privy and the land in respect of any issue of fact which have be try and determine their argument be that the 1976 dismissal of higgins 's original sever case in which he seek to acquire from the state land court a declaration of full ownership over the lot be a dismissal with prejudice under state law that this dismissal therefore determined that higgins own only 40 percent of the lombard lot and the heir own the remainder and that the federal district court be require under the full faith and credit statute 28 u.s.c. about the most one can say be that this background knowledge of purchase in the area might have add to suspicion of a government claim to the lombard lot if there be other more specific indication suggest that the government be claim ownership of the lombard lot if so read and adequately support in the record this would resolve this case in favor of the united states it would mean that such plaintiff have actual knowledge of the government 's claim to the lombard lot as far back as the 1960 however the government be aware of potential claim by lombard descendant the title search report incident to the sale so indicate and by agreement with higgins it withhold the purchase price for the lombard lot apparently $ 13,500 so that higgins could clear up the defect formally the district court merely deny the plaintiff motion to amend which the government claim be a step review solely for abuse of discretion the rationale for limit the partition statute to undisputed title may have vanish in 1972 but any effort to read the two statute in light of each other work both way if the partition statute allow the court to resolve incidental title dispute a point we need not decide it be so only if the suit be bring within the twelve year limitation period but as we read the district court 's decision it rest squarely on a finding that the amendment would be futile because the plaintiff quiet title claim be bar by the statute of limitation a finding that it support with a detailed discussion of the fact 2409a this be a later enact companion to the partition statute that permit a quiet title action against the united states provide it be bring within twelve year of the date that the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest know or should have know of the claim of the united states to sum up we conclude that the rejection of the propose amendment to the complaint can not on this record be support on the ground give for the denial in april 1997 eight descendant of thomas lombard bring the present lawsuit against the united states in the federal district court in massachusetts under the partition statute 28 u.s.c. thus we treat the district court decision just as if the district court have grant the motion to amend and then dismiss the new claim on the ground that the statute of limitation have run then in 1924 two of the child convey their interest to one george higgins possibly say that they own the entire parcel if the same lombard plaintiff now bring a new action under the quiet title statute the united states would assert that the district court 's finding be re judicata on the limitation issue in all likelihood the district court 's quote finding mean only that the plaintiff know that the government be buy property for the national seashore in wellfleet include property in the bound brook island area the government in addition to assert title base on the 1964 decree argue that the partition statute do not extend to suit in which title be dispute the land court hold in the new suit that the early one have make a factual determination of the western boundary of the property and it be this finding to which the court give preclusive effect and while the government 's hand be not perfectly clean give its actual knowledge of higgins 's doubtful paper title to the whole the plaintiff be in some measure seek a windfall from property widely think to have be lose long ago by the family but the statute of limitation in this case be trigger only if the plaintiff know or should have know of the government 's claim compare united states v. beggerly 118 s. ct 1862 1868 1998 that for other reason they may have doubt their own title be beside the point unless this fact fit into a set of inference suggest that they believe or should have believe that the government claim title however the plaintiff full faith and credit argument be without merit and to prevail ultimately the plaintiff would have to avoid the 1964 quiet title judgment and defeat a likely claim by the government that higgins have obtain full title to the lombard lot by adverse possession this appeal arise out of a title dispute between a family and the united states over an 8.6 acre parcel know as the lombard lot contain within it a family cemetery and locate in the bound brook island area of wellfleet cape cod massachusetts in november 1998 the district court grant the government 's motion for summary judgment as to the partition statute claim deny the plaintiff motion for summary judgment as to title deny as futile the plaintiff motion for leave to amend and enter final judgment for the united states we agree that if the government put a gate at the entrance to your property this be ordinarily sufficient notice to warrant inquiry and have the plaintiff suspicion been arouse the government 's claim would have be easy to discover either by ask national seashore official or look at the title record at the barnstable registry in 1935 higgins petition the massachusetts land court to register and confirm his sole title to nearly 150 acre of land in the bound brook island area include the 8.6 acre lombard lot in waive sovereign immunity to quiet title action against it the government establish a special limitation period favorable to itself but only where the property ownership know or should have know that the government claim ownership and then fail to dispute it within the period this might well be the case if they have know of higgins 's sale to the government but the record be at good uncertain on this point only with more detailed and specific finding by the district court could the gate help to show that the plaintiff should have know of a government claim to own the lombard lot in all event george higgins thereafter claim ownership of the entire parcel and not just of the 40 percent that the two child have actually own the more serious problem with the gate argument be that nothing in the testimony or crude map in the record indicate to we precisely where the gate be place in relation to the property line of the lombard lot 1738 to accept this determination as bind in the present action against the united states the district court rule that the lombard heir have enough information to alert they over twelve year ago to the government 's adverse claim to the lombard lot and this be a somewhat different point that many of the plaintiff acknowledge by their admission and action that they think that they have no interest in the property

pende the outcome of arbitration argue that relief could not be grant in the district court because all of morani 's claim be cover by a valid arbitration agreement in effect what morani be say be that when the district judge stay the proceed pende arbitration morani be entitle to submit some of his claim to the arbitrator withhold other and say nothing to the judge about this reservation until after the arbitrator have act and the case have return to court unsatisfie with the outcome morani return pro se to district court move to vacate the arbitration decision and request a hearing or trial on his original complaint p. 12(b 56 grant summary judgment for the appellee stress in a write opinion that morani have voluntarily submit his claim to arbitration by file the uniform submission agreement and statement of claim and that t]his court must hold the plaintiff to that voluntarily- enter into agreement on november 20 1998 after a hearing the district court deny the motion to vacate and treat the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment fed in any event to the extent morani fail to present some claim to arbitration that be set forth in the complaint and be arbitrable under his agreement this be a counseled decision morani do not make this argument either in his write opposition to the renew motion to dismiss nor in his lengthy oral presentation at the hearing morani 's wife who also speak at the hearing do refer very briefly to forgery of prospectus receipt as an issue not resolve by arbitration but when the district judge say mistakenly that this be a new claim not raise in the original complaint neither of the moranis correct the district judge this be apparent after compare his brief with the arbitrator own write statement at the close of the arbitration as to the issue actually arbitrate base on morani 's statement of claim and the arbitrator decision morani appear to have submit only the first two claim to arbitration by endorsement the district court stay the case pende arbitration in fact the appellee do not call landenberger and morani apparently be not permit to reopen his case in order to question he after file the pro se complaint morani retain counsel and in october 1997 file a uniform submission agreement""--thus submit certain claim against landenberger and commonwealth to an arbitration panel sponsor by the national association of securities dealers and agree to abide by any result arbitration award morani allege that during and subsequent to his recovery from a motor vehicle accident that leave morani brain damage landenberger fraudulently advise he and his wife to accept an inadequate lump sum settlement from their disability insurer and to invest the money through landenberger and the brokerage company he represent appellee commonwealth equity services inc. commonwealth the agreement warn inter alia that a]rbitration be final and bind on the party and that t]he party be waive their right to seek remedy in court include the right to jury trial the agreement provide that the party agree that all controversy that may arise between we concern any order transaction or the continuation performance or breach of this or any other agreement between we whether enter into before on or after the date of this account be open shall be determine by arbitration before a panel of independent arbitrator and it be a reasonable guess that in consider the motion to dismiss the district court wrongly assume that the arbitration proceeding do encompass all of the claim set forth in morani 's district court complaint the arbitration hearing at which morani be represent by counsel take place over five day in july and august 1998 and result in a $ 10,000 award issue on october 1 1998 but here morani do have counsel when determine what to submit to arbitration and in conduct the arbitration proceeding we add that the district judge make every effort to give morani a fair opportunity to be hear and the judge do all he could to untangle a morass of allegation we be not go to rely on this failure adequately to preserve the issue because counsel for the appellee explicitly tell the district judge that all claim press in morani 's complaint have be submit to arbitration defense counsel twice repeat that statement in his appellate brief he allege that landenberger and commonwealth have violate various federal security law base on landenberger 's advice regard the insurance settlement the inappropriate investment and churning and the lack of disclosure here the district court simply endorse a stay pende arbitration since the party be by then agree that arbitration should occur but surely the court intend that whatever claim in the complaint be arbitrable should be submit to the arbitrator at the same time 1997 cert the judgment of the district court be affirm however when they first open their investment account the moranis have along with landenberger sign a pre dispute arbitration agreement the first be that very little of this be make clear to the district court morani 's brief in this court then describe the issue he now want to pursue and some of they be issue that clearly be arbitrate the lawyer apparently expect base on witness list prepare by the appellee counsel that landenberger would testify on his own behalf and would thus be subject to cross examination 99 1010 dennis g. morani plaintiff appellant v. william landenberger and commonwealth equity services inc defendants appellees the judge hear not only from morani and his wife but also from a non lawyer advocate whom morani bring to court and the judge press both side in an effort to develop information that neither side have explain adequately at that point morani have already initiate arbitration proceeding in the manner describe above landenberger then allegedly recommend and execute inappropriate investment churn the account by make frequent trade so as to maximize his commission and fail adequately to disclose commission rate and other investment detail to the moranis after learn of landenberger 's allege misconduct morani file a pro se complaint in the federal district court in massachusetts in refuse to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy one ground for vacatur under 9 u.s.c. those claim in morani 's complaint that he choose not to submit to arbitration be nevertheless arbitrable under the agreement or at least he do not give we any reason to think otherwise the three- member arbitration panel do not make any finding of fact or otherwise explain the basis for the award indeed the arbitration agreement provide that t]he arbitrator award be not require to include factual or legal reasoning morani 's statement of claim echo the allegation in the pro se complaint regard churning and the inadequate insurance settlement what appear to have happen be this after present testimony from several witness but not landenberger morani 's lawyer indicate that he be prepared to rest his case but morani can hardly disavow the agreement at this late stage after invoke it himself and proceeding to arbitration with the assistance of counsel this may not be a frivolous argument in light of morani 's brain damage see generally krasner v. berk 319 n.e.2d 897 898 900 mass. co. 388 u.s. 395 403 04 1967 it be hard to find any direct precedent on this issue if arbitration be welcome the complain party be usually anxious to submit all of its arguably arbitrable claim to arbitration conversely if arbitration be dispute normally an order issue direct arbitration of arbitrable claim this appear as we have just explain to be an inaccurate statement his district court complaint arguably cover four different claim and available evidence suggest that he probably submit only two of those claim in the arbitration proceeding however morani face a second difficulty"

69	69	198704.json	 thus platt argue the king statement be more consistent with the description of the robber give by kim stark the econo lodge clerk and without the king statement the jury would not have vote to convict base on braley 's inconsistent testimony the robert king statement at a post arrest interview in january 1995 robert king provide the following version of the econo lodge robbery on the evening of july 16 1994 king and his friend dale braley and timothy boudreau be drive around bangor in boudreau 's car when the police stop the car and ticket boudreau for drag racing b dale braley the state 's other eyewitness to the robbery be codefendant dale braley who give the following account in july 1994 he share a bangor apartment with his fiancee wendy his brother donald braley thomas platt and platt 's girlfriend angela turner the defense suggest that state 's exhibit 1 the old orchard beach sweatshirt wear by one of the robber belong to dale braley 's brother donald rather than platt in order to substantiate the braley testimony that platt know kim stark the state call both stark and dale braley 's brother donald to confirm that platt have stay overnight at the econo- lodge two week prior to the robbery far from hinder the defense the king statement allow it to exploit an otherwise unavailable theory that only two people viz dale braley and king commit the econo lodge robbery and that no third person remain outside in the getaway vehicle thus in attempt to impeach the king statement the defense be allow to introduce evidence that king have recently recant his january 1995 statement and now claim that platt be never involve in the robbery second the defense intimate that two person robert king and dale braley rob the econo lodge not three furthermore although the defense impeach braley with his prior criminal record and thoroughly explore the term of the plea agreement the jury hear testimony that braley have important reason not to lie about platt 's involvement braley who be serve a twelve year prison sentence with all but six year suspend acknowledge that perjury would have expose he to six year further imprisonment finally timothy boudreau testify that platt king and dale braley have show up together at boudreau 's apartment on the morning of the robbery that all three be act hyper and that platt look wide eyed and attentive first the defense suggest that dale braley 's brother donald who have a prior robbery conviction commit the econo lodge robbery along with robert king and dale braley and that dale falsely implicate platt to protect donald since the econo lodge clerk could neither identify the two robber nor state whether a third participant have remain in the braley car the central dispute at trial be whether platt or some other mask person viz dale braley have accompany robert king into the motel office d the platt admissions the state also present four witness angela turner donald braley timothy boudreau and susan boober who testify that platt have admit in the presence of each that he have take part in the econo lodge robbery braley testify that platt have the duffel bag in his possession when braley and boudreau pick he up at the airport and that the same bag be in the back seat of braley 's car on the morning of the robbery importantly the defense impeach the king statement along substantially the same line as it have do with braley introduce evidence of king 's plea agreement and prior criminal record e.g. a 1992 robbery conviction dale braley the driver wait in his car platt next contend that the jury must have reject the braley testimony i as unreliable since he admittedly give the police different version of the crime and ii as self serve since he receive a reduce sentence for cooperate with the state thus the corroborate evidence tend strongly to substantiate the dale braley testimony that platt have be the third participant in the econo lodge robbery i background in the early morning hour of july 17 1994 two person wear camouflage net mask enter the office of the econo lodge in bangor maine accost the desk clerk with a knife and make off with $ 1000 in cash levasseur 70 f.3d at 193 a kim stark kim stark the clerk on duty at the econo lodge on july 17 1994 provide the follow eyewitness version of the robbery at 2 a.m. two person enter the office while she be on the phone furthermore dale braley neither testify that king and platt have not retrieve the mask from the duffel bag nor that they have not wear mask or carry a knife into the motel turner testify that she have loan the bag to platt for a trip to chicago on july 9 11 1994 that she have not see it after platt return from the trip and far that a friend have supply platt with camouflage clothing tellingly dale braley 's brother donald testify that platt have buy the sweatshirt on a recent trip to old orchard beach a maroon duffel bag with white handle which platt have borrow from angela turner be visible in the back seat of the braley car donald also testify that some time after the robbery he have drive to ohio street with platt platt 's friend dennis sullivan and sullivan 's girlfriend susan boober where he see they hide the plastic shopping bag in the bridge foundation after platt brandish the knife and force the clerk to open the cash register he and king return to the braley car and the defense adduce evidence that in january 1996 robert king have give a different account of the robbery claim that platt be not involve finally the defense rely on evidence that donald braley have spend one night with platt at the econo lodge in late june 1994 thus suggest that donald may have be the person who tell dale braley and robert king on july 17 that he know the motel clerk result in a decision that be contrary to or involve an unreasonable application of clearly establish federal law as determine by the supreme court of the united states see gray 118 s. ct at 1156 hold that as a class this sort of redacted statement pose too great a risk that the factfinder may presume that the unnamed actor be the defendant thereafter braley and king meet platt and the three drive off in braley 's car stark testify that one of the robber have wear the old orchard beach sweatshirt state 's exhibit 1 braley testify that platt own the sweatshirt and have wear it on the day of the robbery finally under the harmless error analysis the critical inquiry be not whether the braley testimony stand alone be reliable but whether the jury return a guilty verdict against platt solely because the robert king statement be in evidence 99 1056 thomas platt plaintiff appellant v. the state of maine defendant appellee 1996 platt focus on what he consider a crucial discrepancy robert king state that he and platt have don the mask which be in the duffel bag whereas dale braley do not see they do so thus have the jury find ground to consider braley 's testimony suspect it would have have like ground to reject as unreliable the robert king statement three day before the sjc decision become final however the united states supreme court have issue its decision in gray v. maryland 118 s. ct 1151 1998 which hold that the use of incriminate statement obtain from nontestifye codefendant violate the defendant 's right of confrontation even though the prosecution redact their statement by replace the defendant 's name with a neutral symbol rather angela turner one of two defense witness have be a reluctant government witness see supra note 5 who testify not only that platt be the father of her infant daughter but that she remain close to he and visit he often normally we focus our analysis on three criterion 1 the extent to which the error permeate the proceeding 2 the centrality of the issue affect by the error to the case as actually try and 3 the relative strength of the properly admit evidence of guilt similarly boudreau testify that platt be his friend and that in the fall of 1994 he have not tell the police that platt have admit his involvement in the econo lodge robbery as the state acknowledge robert king 's statement readily meet the second of the three levasseur test the centrality of the issue implicate by the error since there can be no real question but that the jury would have understand some person as a reference to platt on the evening of july 16 1994 braley and his friend robert king be ride on main street in bangor with tim boudreau at the wheel first braley acknowledge that platt 's duffel bag contain a couple of camouflage suit be in the back seat of the braley car while braley wait in his car platt and king go into the motel thus the dale braley testimony do not contradict kim stark 's statement that the robber wear mask while inside the motel inside the bag there be a tag bear the name and address of platt 's girlfriend angela turner as well as a camouflage net jacket with hood two camouflage baseball cap fit with netting mask some brown glove and a halloween mask finally donald braley acknowledge that he and platt have stay at the econo lodge on a previous occasion the burden rest with the state to establish that the putative bruton gray error have no substantial and injurious effect or influence in determine the jury 's verdict or that it be not of such magnitude that it actually cast doubt on the integrity of the verdict thus the king statement be directly on point rather the third criterion the relative strength of the case for the prosecution and the defense absent the offending evidence be the major test of harmlessness

72	72	198707.json	 although the guideline language do not nail down the point we think that in general the plea of guilty it envisage be an unconditional plea to the indictment see united states v. morillo 8 f.3d 864 871 72 1st cir 1993)--unless the government and defendant agree to some less set of offense condition or both see united states v. donovan 996 f.2d 1343 1345 1st cir the next day as the trial be about to resume the defendant agree to plead guilty to all charge and in exchange the government agree to withdraw the information under section 851 and to recommend at sentence a two level reduction in the defendant 's offense level for acceptance of responsibility but of course the government 's consent to a guilty plea be not require so what hines actually mean be that the government would not agree before trial to confer certain benefit within its control i.e. provide its support for a two- level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and withholding or withdraw the information imagine for example that a defendant offer to plead to all count but one say with good cause that this last charge be unconstitutional and imagine far that on the eve of trial the judge agree the last count be dismiss and a guilty plea be take to all other count hines seek a three level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility the government support a two level reduction as promise but it oppose the third level which be available inter alia where the defendant otherwise have a criminal offense level of 16 or high qualify for a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and have assist authority in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by take one or more of the follow step 1 timely provide complete information to the government concern his own involvement in the offense or 2 timely notify authority of his intention to enter a plea of guilty thereby permit the government to avoid prepare for trial and permit the court to allocate its resource efficiently in donovan we sustain the denial of a three level reduction for a defendant who plead guilty on the eve of trial there too the defendant say that his offer to plead guilty to reduce charge have be make early but the government have refuse it to obtain cooperation on the second day of trial after this witness conclude his direct testimony the party attempt to negotiate a plea in both case one might argue we do not decide the outcome that the spirit of the guideline would be satisfied and remember that the guideline itself do not say plea of guilty to what at a plea hearing conduct on february 19 1998 the government describe the term of the plea bargain include the provision waive hines 's right to appeal from the sentence so long as it do not exceed the statutory maximum prior to trial there be apparently some discussion with the government as to a possible plea of which more hereafter but no agreement be reach the government 's action in this regard be unexplained but it be quite possible that until the co defendant plead the government hold the threat of a mandatory life sentence over hines 's head in order to coerce hines 's cooperation hines then notice an appeal and the district court be remind of the waiver say that the validity of the appeal in light of the waiver be a matter for this court 98 1821 united states of america appellee v. darius hines defendant appellant as already note there might be some basis for a three level reduction where the defendant resist an early plea to an indictment that be itself overbroad as to one or more of its charge but so far as we know there be nothing whatever improper about the section 851 information that the government hold in reserve then file and later withdraw this be make explicit in the commentary which say that to qualify for the third level reduction the notice will usually occur particularly early in the case and must come at a sufficiently early point in the process so that the government may avoid prepare for trial as a predicate we note that under the guideline a three level reduction under section 3e1.1(b)(2 be mandatory if the state condition be meet in the end the question may be not whether waiver be allow but when what kind upon what explanation and to what extent see e.g. united states v. springer 28 f.3d 236 237 1st cir the two level reduction be for contrition and contrition can exist even where albeit in unusual circumstance the defendant go to trial 3e1.1 comment vicki s. marani department of justice with whom donald k. stern united states attorney and george w. vien assistant united states attorney be on brief for the united states e.g. united states v. schmidt 47 f.3d 188 190 7th cir in response hines say that as a matter of public policy such waiver should not be enforce against a defendant and that in any event his waiver be not know or voluntary he now suggest that this be because the government hold over his head the threat of the section 851 information its filing hines say would have mean a mandatory life sentence make acceptance of responsibility meaningless 1998 united states v. talladino 38 f.3d 1255 1263 64 1st cir 1996 united states v. covarrubias 65 f.3d 1362 1367 68 7th cir here of course hines do not agree to plead guilty until trial be actually underway and the government have call one witness and prepare other 1995 united states v. marin 961 f.2d 493 496 4th cir the only dispute condition in this case be whether hines timely notif[ie the prosecutor of his intention to enter a plea of guilty thereby permit the government to avoid prepare for trial and permit the court to allocate its resource efficiently united states v. marroquin 136 f.3d 220 223 1st cir three month later the court hold a sentencing hearing the district court rule that hines be entitle to a two level but not a three level reduction that with that reduction hines be subject under the guideline to a minimum

williams 86 f.3d 1203 1206 d.c. cir november 8 1999 boudin circuit judge in this case we have no reason to decide the waiver issue since the result be the same whether the waiver be give effect or the merit be resolve or suppose that well before trial the defendant admit his guilt on all count but one plead guilty to all other count and be acquit at trial on the remain count give the purpose set forth in the thereby clause the notice of an intent to plead guilty must ordinarily be give well before trial otherwise a defendant could offer at the outset to plead guilty to only one of several offense or to a less offense and then claim to have satisfy the requirement of timely notice credit union v. delbonis 72 f.3d 921 924 1st cir on this appeal the government suggest that we ought not

in which a valid waiver deprive we of jurisdiction and create a possible objection to bypass waiver and decide the merit this court 's jurisdiction to decide a timely appeal from a sentence be establish by statute and the choice among available ground for disposition be a matter for the inform judgment of the court reverse the cliche about wagner 's music the argument sound well than it be four day before trial the government file an information under 21 u.s.c. he argue that in these extreme circumstance the refusal to plead guilty in advance of trial should not be regard as

one of the most dangerous time for both partner be at the point or threat of separation in conclude that there be no exigent circumstance justify the officer action the magistrate judge rely on the officer lack of haste in go to fletcher 's home after hearing that mcdonald have be see there early the lack of a history of physical violence in the pair 's relationship and the fact that the police see nothing to suggest plaintiff be in danger that evening fear that mcdonald have reentere the home and know that fletcher be vulnerable in her handcuffed position genest return to the front door find it lock and shout a demand that the door be open the sequence of event describe early three call to the police a protective order mcdonald 's be jail could easily lead the officer to the conclusion that fletcher be at risk on the night of july 31 indeed at great risk than she have be previously fletcher then bring a federal civil right action against the officer the town and the bail commissioner on the evening of july 31 1997 the date of the incident in question officers genest and bessey go on duty at 6 p.m. the magistrate judge in deny summary judgment find that the officer lack of haste mean that exigent circumstance do not exist to justify the entry this be particularly true when as in this case the resolution of the officer claim for qualified immunity hinge on a court 's decision that the law be clearly establish at the time the charge of escape do not result in a violation of she clearly establish constitutional right and the officer be therefore protect by qualified immunity far the situation have at this point escalate increase the possibility that mcdonald might engage in violence aware of the restraining order and past occasion on which fletcher seek police help the police enter her home despite her objection and her assertion that mcdonald be not in the house v accordingly we affirm in part and reverse in part the magistrate judge 's denial of

would have face the threat of suit fletcher in contrast say that she never open the door but that the officer let themselves in through the front door which might have be lock fletcher 's own testimony be that she lie to the officer and say mcdonald be not in the house or in the bathroom mcdonald have not be physically violent with fletcher fletcher have not hesitate to call the police when she feel in danger and the officer see no evidence of violence after a struggle with mcdonald the officer spray pepper spray into the bathroom and mcdonald slam the door closed leave the officer outside we affirm in part and reverse in part hold that the officer have qualify immunity as to count i and ii of the complaint and find the defendant have waive their appeal from the denial of

before a copy be also deliver to the clinton police department as the agency responsible for enforce the order arrest protective order and other attempt to break the cycle of violence often increase the short term danger to abuse victim thus the officer be entitle to qualified immunity as to the first entry we conclude that an objectively reasonable officer face the circumstance that genest and

dispatch who he be and explain that no assistance be need at that time 1995 we do not think that the police must stand outside an apartment despite legitimate concern about the welfare of the occupant

activity that have be hold to satisfy this demand criterion include the administration of election the operation of a company town eminent domain peremptory challenge in jury selection and in at least limited circumstance the operation of a municipal park for the purpose of nexus analysis the appellant 's claim that the town as a general matter exercise a modicum of control over lbc by reason of the sanctioning requirement and the reserved power to regulate the use of school gymnasia miss the mark pass the fact that the appellant unveil this assertion for the first time on appeal and it be therefore procedurally default see campos orrego v. rivera 175 f.3d 89 95 1st cir more importantly however the appellant 's construct misconstrue the law to the precise contrary the fact though we have view they in the light most congenial to the appellant do not warrant a finding of joint participation to the degree need to sustain a claim of state action at the start of the 1997 1998 season

conclusion subject to certain caveat another factor that court take into account in evaluate the nature of the relationship between the state and a private entity be whether and if so to what extent the former knowingly share in the profit spawn by the latter 's discriminatory conduct in the 1980s arthur psaledas the town 's recreation director run a youth basketball program on his own time thus in contrast to the nexus inquiry this avenue of approach oust the challenge conduct from center stage and concentrate instead on the nature of the overall relationship between the state and the private entity and without factual support for the conclusory claim that the same sex tournament rule which the town have no hand in propound be indispensable to the town 's success anent the venture the profit share rationale will not wash see burton 365 u.s. at 723 24 such a nexus require more than the state 's passive acquiescence in or mere approval of the challenge conduct appendix the town 's sanctioning requirement for use of the school gym quote verbatim and in full provide that 1 in point of fact the appellant can prevail in this instance only by demonstrate that the town exercise coercive power over or significantly encourage lbc 's promulgation of the same sex tournament rule or its decision to ban the appellant from tourney participation in a meticulously reason unpublished opinion the district court grant the motion as to the fourteenth amendment and section 1983 claim hold that lbc 's conduct do not constitute state action the mere fact that over the year lbc donate some $ 22,000 to the town a relatively small percentage of the total fund that it raise do not suffice to bind the town 's gain to the same sex tournament rule see tarkanian 488 u.s. at 197 n.18

exclusive state function citation omit san francisco arts amp athletics inc. v. united states olympic comm 483 u.s. 522 545 1987 neither the conduct nor the coordination of amateur sport have be a traditional governmental function build on this foundation the appellant assert that by maximize participation the rule simultaneously maximize lbc 's profit and therefore maximize the town 's profit here the appellant posit that the town 's sanctioning requirement and control over scheduling constitute impermissible rationing and thus joint participation the united states district court for the district of new hampshire discern no state action resolve the constitutional claim adversely to the appellant albeit without reach the merit and decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the appellant 's pendent state law claim hence the nexus claim fail second for profit sharing to be relevant the challenged conduct must be indispensable to the financial success of the joint project finally the appellant labor to demonstrate that lbc be not independent in the conduct of its everyday affair in rendell baker v. kohn 457 u.s. 830 842 1982 the court hold that the education of maladjuste high school student be not an exclusive function of the state and therefore be not an inherently governmental function thus the focal point be the connection between the state and the challenged conduct not the broad relationship between the state and the private entity this inquiry be a target one with the challenge conduct at the hub of the analytical wheel and the justices mindful of the fact sensitive nature of the inquiry have staunchly eschew any attempt to construct a universally applicable litmus test to distinguish state action from private conduct because psaledas have be handle these submission for many year he know the need of the basketball soccer volleyball and other league and automatically furnish information to the school district on behalf of lbc and other similarly situate private group see magill 516 f.2d at 1335 explain that facility use decision in and of themselves do not significantly involve the state in the athletic conference 's

court 's grant of summary judgment de novo see coyne 53 f.3d at 457 follow the appellant mass her heavy artillery behind the claim that lbc and the town enjoy a symbiotic relationship sufficient to establish state action the scene now shift from seabrook to londonderry new hampshire the town where basketball have prove to be a popular pastime in case that involve indirect state action court conventionally have travel a trio of analytic avenue deem a private entity to have become a state actor if 1 it assume a traditional public function when it undertake to perform the challenge conduct or 2 an elaborate financial or regulatory nexus tie the challenge conduct to the state or 3 a symbiotic relationship exist between the private entity and the state in order to prevail under the second test for state action a plaintiff must show a close nexus between the state and the challenge action of the private entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treat as that of the state itself rather the plaintiff must show that the state have exercise coercive power or have provide such significant encouragement either overt or covert that the challenge conduct fairly can be attribute to the state background we marshal the fact in the light most hospitable to the appellant 's theory of the case draw all reasonable inference in her favor the appellant next propose that a symbiotic relationship exist because the town knowingly share in profit generate by the challenge conduct i.e. the same sex tournament rule in the second place the record reflect that both sanctioned and non sanctioned group actually use the gym point out that lbc take over the task of operate the youth basketball program from the town 's recreation director the appellant contend that lbc assume a traditional public function assume arguendo that repeal the rule would shrink lbc 's revenue there be no basis for a finding that lbc 's donation to the town also would shrink let alone that they would diminish so drastically as to undermine the town 's approval of lbc 's use of public school gymnasia during the baseball season the little league preempt the facility five night per week and on saturdays vastly restrict other group access to they to the point that other user often be precluded from all practical access extensive regulation without more can not establish the necessary nexus although sanctioned group theoretically receive priority in scheduling this fact alone without proof of adverse effect do not amount to the type of rationing that constitute state action the district court disagree and so do we the appellant hypothesize that each and all of these avenue lead to the conclusion that lbc 's conduct meet the requirement of the state action doctrine this dichotomy distinguishe between state action which must conform to the prescription of the fourteenth amendment and private conduct which generally enjoy immunity from fourteenth amendment stricture

court instruct the jury on negligent failure to warn the court submit varano 's negligence claim to the jury which find for jabar we conclude that whether or not jabar be a seller under maine law the court submit to the jury the same element in the negligence instruction as varano would have be entitle to under a strict liability failure to warn instruction on march 9 1995 jabar 's employee be back at work on the roof of the mall thus while the maine court indicate that there be difference in the defense and limitation on liability applicable to the two cause of action both cause spring from an identical duty of care regardless of whether a failure to warn claim be phrase in term of negligence or strict liability the analysis 14 221 in a duty to warn context be the responsibility to inform user and consumer of danger about which the seller either know or should know at the time the product be sell the maine court quote the comment of professor prosser who state that the two claim be the same except that the claim sound in strict liability be subject to strict liability defense and other limitation on liability rather than the defense and limitation relevant to negligence claim she go outside the store and see that employee of jabar 's company mike 's roofing be work on the roof in response two of jabar 's employee and jabar 's wife wendy collins come to the nautica store back inside the store varano find that the odor have grow strong so she call the property management company to report the problem the district court deny the res ipsa loquitur instruction state i think the evidence do not show that this accident could happen only as a result of the conduct on the part of the defendant and that there be no showing no basis on which a jury could conclude there be no other explanation than the conduct of the defendant in bring about the injury complain of in this case the district court grant judgment as a matter of law against varano on the ground that jabar be not a seller of splice adhesive within the meaning of maine 's product liability statute i on appeal varano argue that the district court err in enter judgment against she on her strict liability claim in permit jabar to introduce evidence of his past use of the adhesive without injury and in deny she request re ipsa loquitur instruction we affirm the judgment of the district court varano testify that on february 17 1995 she be work in her office in the back of the nautica store in a mall in kittery maine after varano present her case the district court enter judgment as a matter of law against she on her strict liability failure to warn claim because the court conclude that jabar be not a seller of the adhesive which be a statutory element of varano 's claim under maine law accord to the restatement second of torts it be the function of the court to determine whether the inference may reasonably be draw by the jury or whether it must necessarily be draw he open the can and varano identify the odor as the one she have smell in the store on february 17 the court submit varano 's negligence claim to the jury but refuse varano 's request re ipsa loquitur instruction on the ground that varano have not adduce evidence that would warrant the instruction after the incident at the store in february and march 1995 varano be diagnose with occupational asthma induce by exposure to isocyanate in neither situation may the court weigh the evidence make credibility determination or resolve conflict in the proof under maine law the res ipsa loquitur doctrine permit a finding of negligence in connection with an unexplained event if the plaintiff can show 1 the event be of a kind which ordinarily do not occur in the absence of negligence 2 other responsible cause be sufficiently eliminate by the evidence and 3 the indicate negligence be within the scope of the defendant 's duty to the plaintiff she hear some banging on the roof of the store follow by the presence of a strong odor of glue or adhesive consequently we need not reach the question of whether jabar be a seller under the maine product liability statute i. varano argue that the district court err in enter judgment as a matter of law against she on her strict liability claim on the ground that jabar be not a seller of splice adhesive within the meaning of i if the court erroneously fail to instruct on a material issue of fact we still may not grant a new trial on the basis of that error if the error be harmless therefore any possible error in deny varano the chance to submit her strict liability failure to warn claim to the jury be harmless be basically the same instead the court must determine whether the evidence present at trial along with all inference that may reasonably be draw therefrom could plausibly support a finding for either party on any give issue of material fact to the contrary such evidence be directly relevant to varano 's claim that jabar 's use of splice on february 17 cause her injury we need not decide whether on different fact there might be some difference between the strict liability failure to warn and negligent failure to warn claim under maine law the only difference urge upon we in this case concern whether the strict liability failure to warn theory must include the concept that the supplier know or should have know of the danger pose by the defect the court permit jabar to introduce evidence that he have use the adhesive in the past without any problem varano say that since jabar deny use the splice on the date in question evidence of what happen on other occasion when he do use it be irrelevant here because varano only object to the evidence by a motion in limine and make no contemporaneous objection we review for plain error varano argue that this testimony be irrelevant because jabar contend at trial that his employee do not use splice adhesive on february 17 1995 but only clear ice and snow off the roof

that find to be an affirmative finding of fraud 2 uphold the ins 's finding of fraud despite the fact that the ins call no witness and offer no documentation rely instead on the petitioner 's form i-751 joint petition its support document and the notice of intent to terminate conditional resident status and 3 determine that the respondent do not meet his burden of show that it be a bona fide marriage when in fact the burden be on the ins to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his marriage be enter into to procure immigration benefit instead the petitioner rely heavily on his contention that the district director and the ij never make affirmative finding of marriage fraud and therefore the bia in its failure to independently review the record mistakenly conclude that there be a host of evidence show that the petitioner have violate immigration law at the conclusion of the deportation hearing on december 28 1993 the immigration judge ij affirm the denial of the joint petition and deny the petitioner 's application for suspension of deportation likewise in its affirmance of deportability the bia rely on the ij 's finding that the petitioner be not a credible witness and on the evidence of marriage fraud to the contrary base on the petitioner 's record of lie before the ij file false document before the ins file tax return list his child as a dependent when all the evidence suggest otherwise and enter into a previous questionable marriage we conclude that any reasonable fact finder would determine on this record that the petitioner have marry duarte for the purpose of procure immigration benefit in deny the motion to remand the bia consider the merit of his request for adjustment of status and conclude that the positive factor of the grant visa the relationship with his new wife and child and strong work history be outweigh by the adverse factor a host of evidence which indicate that the respondent have engage in marriage fraud on two prior

prerequisite to adjustment of status render this issue moot if the alien seek review of the district director 's decision in the deportation proceeding the burden of proof be place on the ins to

fail to raise it at his deportation hearing at his hearing for suspension of deportation or before the bia in reach this conclusion the ij rely on the inconsistency in the petitioner 's testimony

then state that these interest if they go unclaimed for five year would be transfer to the united states treasury in the name and credit of the united states pursuant to 28 u.s.c. they argue that give the failure of other party to appear the trial court should conclude that the ruxton heir be the close heir with a claim to the property and consequently award they the interest of the absent party pursuant to mass. nothing in the distribution prevent the ruxton claimant from file a motion below state that they be for example the heir of lilla rich higgins and thus entitle under the very term of the distribution to these fund the ruxton heir argue that in addition to the share award to they by the trial court they be entitle to claim the interest of absent heir who do not appear in court and whose existence in some case can not be confirm the absent heir paragraph one of the order distribute a portion of the award to the ruxton heir and other party before the court base on the percent that the dallas report state they have inherit distribution of the condemnation award rather than challenge the specific percentage award in the distribution the ruxton heir argue that they as the close heir to come forward be entitle to collect the share of the absent heir pursuant to mass. the language of 2042 and the case law make clear that the ruxton heir entitlement to these fund if any exist irrespective of whether the fund sit in the court registry or the united states treasury the court reject this claim note that even after deposit in the united states treasury the fund remain subject to the order of the district court to be pay to the person lawfully entitle to it upon proof of their ownership we will leave that determination in the first instance to the district court however the district court do not award the beneficial interest in these fund to the united states and the ruxton heir challenge to the distribution fail when deprive of this premise the court also provide that five year follow the date of the judgment unclaimed fund would be remove from the court 's own registry and deposit in the treasury of the united states pursuant to 28 u.s.c 2042 if 2042 award the interest of the absent heir to the united states the ruxton heir would have a plausible argument that the district court deprive they of their interest in the condemnation fund on appeal we conclude that the trial court have properly distribute the interest of two of the four original heir to the eight acre charles and richard sr see cadorette v. united states 988 f.2d 215 1st cir rather the court after identify the entitlement of the absent party in paragraph two leave open the question of who could claim their share while 2042 do provide that unclaimed fund will be deposit in the united states treasury in the name and to the credit of the united states the statute go on to state that a]ny claimant entitle to any such money may on petition to the court and upon notice to the united states attorney and full proof of the right thereto obtain an order direct payment to he soon other intervene in the lawsuit all claim that they too be heir of edmund the elder and thus own a share of the property that elizabeth have sell to the government regrettably the seller of the property elizabeth freeman own only a small fraction of the land she purport to convey at the same time as we note in cadorette the court apparently retain a degree of freedom to divide compensation and to condition its distribution in a manner that seem fair in light of the possibility that lose heir may eventually appear nonetheless there be no ruling of the court that bar they from assert a claim under the term set forth in the distribution or otherwise conclusively determine that they could not collect the share of the absent heir the ruxton heir argue that the district court deny they their claim to the fund of absent party by escheate the interest of the absent heir to the united states their entitlement to the fund of the absent heir be therefore not yet ripe for our resolution the trial court enjoy extremely broad latitude in determine the appropriate share of the common fund and may calculate such an award either on the basis of a reasonable percentage of the fund or use a lodestar method to multiply a reasonable hourly rate by the compensable hour the attorney work on the matter the ruxton heir suggest that the non- appearance of more direct heir create a presumption that they do not exist and that their interest in the property would therefore pass to the ruxton claimant the close heir who have appear for example the court award the heirs of amy swett higgins approximately three percent of the proceed give our involvement with this collateral heir issue in the cadorette appeal and our remand with the instruction that the party relitigate their claim we conclude that the silence below can not be construe as an implicit denial of the claim of the ruxton heir the ruxton heir be free to return to the district court and assert their claim to the fund of the absent party attorneys fee the ruxton heir argue that the district court award inadequate fee to their attorney john hallisey under the common fund doctrine give the sparsity of information the district court have inappropriately presume that betsy i and edmund ii 's line have die out and it have be particularly inappropriate to presume that they have die out during the one seven year period under which the party before the court would be entitle under massachusetts law to their entire interest in the land rose austin l. rose and the estate of priscilla l. rose collectively the ruxton heir or ruxton claimant appeal from an order of the united states district court for the district of massachusetts establish the interest of several dozen claimant in a condemnation award we rule that the initiation of condemnation proceeding moot the quiet title dispute and thus displace any further need for the trial court to determine the interest of betsy i and edmund ii in the quiet title action pursuant to that order the ruxton heir may still claim that they be entitle to collect a portion of the award reserve for the absent heir emphasis add this order do not bar the claim of the ruxton heir to the portion of the award set aside for the absent party for example the dallas report conclude that the heirs of william edward sargent betsy i 's grandson be entitle to a specific share of the eight acre but it fail to specify who those heir be but we vacate the trial court 's decision to distribute the interest of the other two original heir betsy i and edmund ii solely to those litigant who be presently before it the issue turn once again to distribution the united states present the finding of its expert genealogist george m. dallas who have author a report trace the devolution of ownership interest of betsy i and edmund ii the dallas report although we understand the ruxton heir desire to have their allotted interest in the fund of the absent heir finally decide their assertion that the district court have already rule against they by escheate these fund to the united states be erroneous under 3 the ruxton heir be collateral heir to all of the descendant of betsy i and edmund ii the ruxton heir claim that the district court deprive they of this entitlement by rule that the unclaimed fund would escheat to the united states here we sketch the outline focus on the specific relevant to this dispute in addition to affirm the dallas report 's genealogical evidence the district court establish procedure for the party to claim their share the united states appeal argue that the trial court misapply massachusetts law 1957 a]lthough such subsequent deposit in the federal treasury be require by the statute to be in the name and to the credit of the united states the fact be that the united states have no beneficial interest therein but hold the money as statutory trustee for the rightful owner when and if they be determine by the court we start by analyze the escheat claim and then turn to the language of the distribution free from the misconception

the issuance of regulation a mere legislative function in order to lead he not to hold the balance nice clear and true ward 409 u.s. at 60 a panel member would have to be sway by his own pro rata share in the additional profit assume that there be any of a relatively tiny proportion of the compact milk receipt 7 the commission have authority to impose price and assessment on elmhurst dairy

per hundredweight cwt into the pool accord to the volume of class i milk purchase we have previously hold that in conduct this inquiry court must look primarily to the plain meaning of the statute

recommendation and reject all claim at the time this suit begin the commission include director of women infants and children 's program of various state the rhode island attorney general 's chief of

or the labor of its resident as note above the hearing panel in this case consist of the commission chair who be also the consumer representative from the maine delegation the chief of the consumer protection division of the rhode island attorney general 's office and the consumer representative from the new hampshire delegation the linchpin of this argument be that because the differential payment pay back to producer through the handler depend on whether the handler be pool plant the pooling mechanism be in effect a subsidy and compensatory payment which be a barrier to the entry of milk into the compact region the commission hold that 1 it have the authority to regulate by impose an over order price and administrative assessment on all pool and partially regulate handler all milk distribute in the new england region regardless of where it be produce 2 application of the over order pricing and pool regulation to partially regulate plant do not constitute an impermissible compensatory payment scheme and 3 the participation of new england farmer and processor in set the over order price do not absent specific allegation of bias violate the due process clause similarly the regulation pass the producer referendum overwhelmingly second they challenge the inclusion of a producer representative in each state 's delegation to the commission the primary purpose of the

precise scope of which be here at issue permit the police to arrest an individual in his home without an arrest warrant as long as they be lawfully on the premise by reason say of a search warrant and probable cause exist 1993 and see no reason in this instance to abandon the almost invariable assumption of the law that juror follow their instruction richardson v. marsh 481 u.s. 200 206 1987 see ingraham 832 f.2d at 236 suggest that the court when perform the requisite balance under rule 403 may take into account the jury 's familiarity with the substance of the evidence in the last analysis probable cause require practical context specific determination make case by case that give due weight to the totality of the circumstance and the trial court 's superior coign of vantage the appellant who cite no case federal or state that hold to the contrary resist this view complain that it diminish the stature of arrest warrant and render they virtually obsolete in the process the court note the high probative value of the evidence flint after all be an alibi witness whose testimony if credit would have exonerate winchenbach and conclude that it be not unduly prejudicial take the totality of the circumstance present the agent belief that the appellant be engage in the distribution of cocaine be eminently reasonable and the fact as supportably find by the trial court see winchenbach 31 f. supp see lafave supra 6.1(c at 249 amp n.114 cite inter alia the mahlberg line of case hence we turn directly to the legitimacy of the arrest this time the agent track spinney to a trailer on the ralph wink road in which defendant appellant ralph winchenbach jr. reside with his quondam paramour arlene jones formerly arlene winchenbach by virtue of her early marriage to one of the appellant 's brother see payton 445 u.s. at 588 90 see also new york v. harris 495 u.s. 14 17 1990 explain that the rule in payton be design to protect the physical integrity of the home 1989 in which the court treat the arrest as take place with probable cause immediately upon entry by the police prior to any search first the prosecutor already have bring the content of the purported conversation to the jury 's attention when without objection he cros examined flint about it the testimony fail this test the appellant do not squarely argue that the mere assertion that the officer miss some bury jar of cocaine during their search of the premise offer in an effort to cooperate with law enforcement sink to the level of an affirmative example of flint 's misconduct such as would significantly affect flint 's credibility and such an argument if make would be unconvincing this argument have be make and reject before in analogous contexts see e.g. watson 423 u.s. at 414 423 24 hold that a warrantless arrest base on probable cause may be make in a public place even though the officer have ample prior opportunity to obtain an arrest warrant yet eschew that course united states v. demasi 40 f.3d 1306 1312 1st cir in our view the evidence gather here include several recorded conversation between holmes who at time wear a body wire and spinney and the agent own observation especially those pertinent to the third transaction afford sufficient corroboration to reduce the risk of error to an acceptable level 1996 cert the court overrule the appellant 's objection and bradford testify that he speak with flint some month after the fact and that flint in an effort to redeem himself for assist in a jailbreak tell he that the agent overlook a quantity of bury cocaine during the search of winchenbach 's trailer conclude as we do that the arrest and the search conduct incident thereto be constitutionally permissible and that the trial court 's admission of the challenge extrinsic evidence pass muster we affirm the judgment of conviction in such an event the cross examiner be permit to show the discrepancy by extrinsic evidence if necessary not to demonstrate which of the two be true but rather to show that the two do not jibe thus call the declarant 's credibility into question the appellant also fault the control employ by the agent and remonstrate that as a result spinney 's statement lack corroboration lafave supra 6.1(b at 236 n.56 in rebuttal however the prosecutor call bradford and seek to interrogate he about the conversation in this court as below the government parry the appellant 's rule 608(b objection by claim that rule 613(b not rule 608(b control the evidentiary question at trial the appellant call arlene jones 's son robbie flint as an alibi witness thus rule 608(b apply to and bar the introduction of extrinsic evidence of specific instance of a witness 's misconduct if offer to impugn his credibility we have frequently remark the prophylactic effect of such limiting instruction see e.g. houlihan 92 f.3d at 1285 united states v. o'bryant 998 f.2d 21 26 1st cir when the appellant open the door the officer immediately enter the trailer arrest he bring he outside and search he lafave supra 6.1(c at 249 emphasis supply accord 1 david s. rudstein et al criminal constitutional law 2.05[3 at 2 189 to 2 190 1998 a police officer act upon probable cause also may make a warrantless arrest in premise not open to the general public when he have lawfully enter the premise for example pursuant to a search warrant the same logic doom the appellant 's argument that during the final transaction spinney do not have sufficient time to drive to and from the ralph wink road the motion to suppress the appellant argue that his arrest be unlawful and that therefore the district court should have suppress the evidence glean from the search of his person for instance spinney might have purchase the cocaine from the appellant 's brother dale winchenbach a know cocaine user who previously have own the trailer and who still live on the ralph wink road albeit in another mobile home like the district court see winchenbach 31 f. supp flint testify inter alia that the appellant be not in the trailer when spinney arrive on september 3 put simply when probable cause exist the timing of an arrest be a matter that the constitution almost invariably leave to police discretion at trial flint deny any knowledge of drug deal at the premise of the appellant 's involvement with drug or of having tell the agent about jar of cocaine bury in the yard we too reject it file u.s.l.w. apply this analysis to the case at hand bradford 's testimony fall within the compass of rule 613(b

anticompetitive consequence of this limitation i.e. less competition and high price and while there be various way to show that state representation be not adequate the burden of overcome the presumption be upon the would be intervenor daggett 172 f.3d at 111 after briefing and argument the district court on january 6 1999 deny intervention to the trade association but grant the defendant motion to dismiss 1992 and the district court opinion in patch 173 f.r.d. the trial court in apply a general rule to specific fact be usually accord a measure of deference in make the adequate representation determination so long as the court apply the proper legal standard 1978 it be common knowledge that many statute regulate private activity to protect the narrow economic interest of other company often to the detriment of the public since we affirm the judgment of dismissal the intervention issue be largely although not entirely academic and we return to it only after address the merit xxi 2 one of the well settle rule in antitrust law be that the sherman act be not intend to apply to the state so as to foreclose otherwise valid state regulation in this case the state have not order or authorize private party to engage in conduct that absent immunity would even arguably violate the antitrust law there be no private agreement or arrangement between retailer as to the number of retail outlet and therefore no violation to be shield the main condition be that the state do so as part of a deliberate policy to displace competition and that the state provide an alternative regime that provide active supervision of the conduct patrick v. burget 486 u.s. 94 100 1988 an example would be a specific authorization for joint ratemaking by intrastate carrier couple with state agency authority to require that the result rate be just and reasonable this resemblance in effect be the gist of the plaintiff position although it be narrow by the suggestion that preemption may be confine to statute that produce the same effect as a per se violation rather than a non per se one and of course plaintiff concede that even a per se violation would be all right if the requisite state policy and active supervision exist here there be no doubt that the commonwealth be zealously interested in uphold the validity of the statute with some ingenuity the plaintiff in this case have seek to make the most of the result ambiguity but perhaps as a counterweight to the broad reading of interest the court have be quite ready to presume that a government defendant will adequately represent the interest of all private defender of the statute or regulation unless there be a showing to the contrary see frank h. easterbrook antitrust and the economics of federalism 26 j.l. but amici like respondent can advise the supreme court of miss argument we certainly do not adopt such a rule in mosbacher where the intervenor overcome the presumption of adequate representation by the government defendant because inter alia the agency have not file an answer to the complaint but have instead accept a consent decree provide for you all the relief seek and subject the fishing group to more stringent rule than have previously be in effect all three entity seek to intervene as of right or in the alternative as permissive intervenor how clearly the policy must be articulate and above all what kind of supervision will suffice be among the issue that have provoke endless litigation the only difference between it and the would be intervenor be their interest in offer other legal argument for example base on the twenty first amendment to sustain the statute massachusetts like many other state extensively regulate the sale of alcoholic beverage fisher v. city of berkeley california 475 u.s. 260 265 1986 138 15 1998 but as we shall see there be qualification on this general rule and the case law be not entirely coherent the district court hold that the wholesaler interest be too general and contingent to justify intervention in the case of mpsa whose member be subject to the very three store regulation challenge by plaintiff the court say that its member do have a direct and concrete interest in defend the statute but that they be adequately represent by the commonwealth miles medical co. v. john d. park amp sons co. 220 u.s. 373 1911 be so close that the supreme court treat the arrangement as if they be nothing other than private resale price maintenance scheme license and abet by the state but even where this necessary condition be present the rule merely permit intervention at the discretion of the district court of course such state statute remain subject to the constraint of the commerce clause and other constitutional provision 23 23 24 1983 the trade association that seek to intervene appeal from the denial of intervention but in an amicus brief support the dismissal of the complaint as for permissive intervention the would be intervenor likely meet the low threshold set by rule 24(b)--that their defense include question of law common to the defense offer by the state see e.g. patrick 486 u.s. at 100 01 suggest that state supervision reinforce requirement that anticompetitive behavior at issue be consistent with the state 's deliberate policy to the exclusion of private control see i areeda supra 226 from these decision mpsa infer a general rule that the state defendant 's representation be inadequate as a matter of course whenever it be also the regulator of the entity that seek to intervene the three store limit be no more an agreement among competitor or subordination of one competitor to the dictate of another than a state electrical code that prescribe safety standard for contractor who wire building for electricity put aside the special status of state liquor regulation under the twenty first amendment u.s. const despite disclaimer the plaintiff case rest in the end on the implicit proposition

rest of the sentence on direct review we sustain the lawfulness of the sentence include the departure the case begin in 1992 when the defendant steven sanders plead guilty to federal charge of be a felon in possession of a firearm 18 u.s.c. may 5 1998 and sander then seek resentencing despite a warning from the district court that this might not be in his good interest it continue in pertinent part as follow the extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the extent of the injury the degree to which it may prove permanent and the extent to which the injury be intend or knowingly risk the basis for the attack be the supreme court 's intervene decision in bailey v. united states 516 u.s. 137 1995 which construe the term use to require active employment of the weapon during the drug crime with no shooting at all sanders gun possession and his record require a 15 year sentence base on the attempt murder and the terrible harm do the court add 12 more year result in a 27 year sentence here the second degree murder analogy can easily be criticize as too kind to sanders it account for the deliberate attempt to murder his victim indeed over account in one sense since harnum do not die but ignore entirely the peculiar brutality of the crime and the terrible permanent harm inflict upon harnum and the awful consequence of that harm e.g. the loss of her child and these element could themselves warrant a very substantial upward departure even if one treat the wicked intent as already cover by the guideline sentence in decide just how far to depart at the original sentencing the district court consider how far it want to go above the sentence that sanders would otherwise serve which include the 60 month as well as the pre departure sentence for the felon in possession offense at the original sentencing in 1992 the district court judge devine sentence sanders to 360 month imprisonment from this starting point of 180 month the district court then depart upward by 144 month again base on significant physical injury to the victim to arrive at the final 324 month sentence in this case the circumstance that give rise to the departure be that sanders seek to murder harnum nearly succeed and inflict upon she an awful and continue injury to protect against the threat of punish a defendant for appeal the supreme court invoke a presumption of vindictiveness and say that a high sentence after retrial must be explain base upon objective information such as new evidence bear on the sentence not available at the initial trial 5k2.2 rely on by the district court provide at the outset that i]f significant physical injury result the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range in our view the pearce limitation where it exist only constrain the bottom line of the new sentence from exceed the bottom line of the old one base on calculation not here in dispute the district court compute sanders initial guideline range for the offense as 135- 168 month but find this trump by the minimum mandatory sentence of 15 year for the offense to which sanders be subject because of his prior conviction he do not dispute the starting point for the departure or the decision to depart constrain on the latter issue by this court 's decision on sanders early appeal see sanders 982 f.2d at 8 10 on march 4 1999 after a hearing sanders be resentence by judge barbadoro who inherit the case on judge devine 's death to 324 month on the felon in possession count but in this case the district court do use a rationale that lend itself to measurement namely what likely would have happen in state court if as usually happens the attempt murder have be independently prosecute under state law where as here the raw fact be not in dispute the end result be usually a judgment call base on all of the pertinent circumstance and be review for abuse of discretion rather sanders able counsel attack the magnitude of the departure 144 month which practically double the guideline maximum 168 month and greatly exceed the mandatory minimum sentence 180 month at the time of the original sentencing harnum be in a vegetative state and be not expect to survive the supreme court have yet to consider the situation in which there be not a subsequent trial and where the resentencing be by a different judge and be occasion by a successful collateral attack on one of the underlie conviction but we will assume dubitante that the presumption of vindictiveness apply in such a case the charge arise from a violent incident in which sanders shoot his girlfriend brenda bayko harnum in the back of the head at point blank range although she survive she be leave permanently and terribly impaired 5k2.3 but the district court decline the invitation for lack of specific evidence as to the child 's condition the government plausibly seek a separate departure for psychological injury to the child see u.s.s.g. this comprise a maximum guideline range sentence for the felon in possession offense compute as 262 month the five year consecutive mandatory sentence for use of a firearm during a drug crime 60 month and a further upward departure 38 month under u.s.s.g. as to intent the court reject as preposterous sanders explanation that the back of the head shooting be an accident result from a struggle it find explicitly that sanders have intend to kill harnum although it describe this as an attempt at murder in the second degree rather than in the first because it apparently grow out of a quarrel and premeditation be uncertain however the court do conclude that harnum 's inability to care for or live with her child be a further indication of the injury inflict upon she and thus properly consider in measure the extent of the departure under u.s.s.g. 1997 cert 1996 cert 1992 cert the two relevant element in this explanation be intentionality and the extent of harm and the district court make finding as to both element depend on how it reason the district court could have choose a small departure or possibly a somewhat large one without court reversal while federal sentencing usually reflect a package approach that offense carry a statutorily mandate separate penalty of 60 month which fall with the overturning of the conviction he argue that under the federal guideline conviction for second degree murder would have produce a guideline range with a maximum far below the 324 month sentence the proper figure for comparison be probably 235 month rather than the 168 month claim by defense counsel but even so the jump from 235 month to 324 month be a large one in its sentencing the court discuss at some length the fact just recite as to intention and harm c. 651:2 ii c but a few year more than the 22 and 1/2 year that defense counsel say be the likely sentence if all of sanders gun relate conduct have be consider in a new hampshire state court 99 1382 united states of america appellee v. steven h. sanders defendant appellant and the 235 month sentence build in a criminal history adjustment base on sanders prior crime which the district court find to place he in category iv although it take no account of his most recent felon in possession offense because sanders guilty plea have be base on a less demanding definition then in force in this circuit the district court vacate sanders conviction on that count in may 1998 see sander v. united states no on this basis the district court depart upward by 144 month sander original sentence like federal sentence in general be a package there a defendant be try and convict appeal win a new trial and after reconviction be give a high sentence 922(g)(1 and use a firearm during a drug trafficking crime 18 u.s.c. assume the premise that it be at least as serious as the first the near doubling be easily explain the new sentence be 324 month less than the total sentence judge devine have impose but large than the amount nominally attributable to the felon in possession count and the departure under judge devine 's sentencing scheme

100	100	198742.json	 it present a narrow but difficult issue under the sentencing guidelines as to the meaning of the term assault in a specific context the question then be whether the assault requirement of the adjustment be satisfied in this case the principal doubt revolve around the scienter requirement for assault accordingly the court make the three level adjustment lead to a guideline range of 51 to 63 month there be thus no doubt that lee 's conduct satisfy most of the requirement of the guideline include immediate flight knowledge that the officer be police and the creation of a substantial risk of serious bodily injury 3a1.2(b with which we be primarily concern say in the commentary that the guideline apply in circumstance tantamount to aggravate assault in the end we think that the policy of this guideline-- to protect official victim embrace the case where an escape criminal drive straight at a police officer know he to be there regardless of whether the criminal desire to hit he so long as the criminal have ample reason to know that fear will be cause the lack of purpose to cause fear should not matter provide that there be no clear error of law we be very likely to sustain the choice of the district judge who have the good feel for the factual subtlety involve the other implicit in what have already be say be that at good lee could have get no more than a one level downward adjustment out of this appeal if the assault adjustment do not apply in this case the reckless endangerment guideline certainly would that subsection design to protect an official victim provide for such an increase where during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom the defendant common law assault embrace two different crime one be attempt battery that is an intend effort to cause bodily harm to another which fall short of success an example would be strike at a police officer but miss regardless of whether the intend victim know of the attempt the fact be take from the undisputed portion of the presentence report the testimony at the sentencing hearing and the district court 's finding here the district court make no finding that lee intend to shoot the police officer and it be not clear that the evidence would readily lend itself to such a finding unless the judge discredit lee 's own statement as to his intent the other branch of assault be an act which be intend to and reasonably do cause the victim to fear immediate bodily harm such menacing constitute assault even if no physical harm be attempt achieve or intend the perfect example of this blurring of specific and general intent be the criminal who flee in a car and drive straight at a police officer stand in his way it be normally hard to tell whether the criminal have a purpose to scare the officer or merely an indifferent awareness of the threat incidental to an override aim to escape surprisingly the answer be far from clear and whatever lee 's purpose his effort to seize his gun do create a substantial risk of bodily injury whether from accidental discharge or the threat of fire from the police 3a1.2 comment while awareness be perhaps a matter of degree this feedback from the official victim during the assault itself take the case pretty far up the scale and justify the adjustment but the district court make no finding that lee have a purpose to shoot at the officer his own hearsay statement be to the contrary or to frighten they there be no evidence on the point but the statute more broadly encompass the action of anyone who forcibly assault resist oppose impede intimidate or interfere with specify federal officer 2a2.2 comment these two notion correspond at least roughly to what common law judge call specific and general intent see united states v. bailey 444 u.s. 394 405 1980 and some of the case and commentary on assault use these term or more modern counterpart that guideline be probably of most help in illuminate the separate requirement in 3a1.2(b that the assault create a substantial risk of serious bodily injury conduct of the a and b type would usually satisfy the risk of harm requirement although the c category conduct do not correspond to anything in our own guideline what be tell be that in several such case obviously the fact vary from case to case court have impose the three- level assault adjustment we be consider while in several other the court have apply only a two level adjustment for reckless endangerment during flight u.s.s.g. while the drafter may not have have this precise question in mind we think that generally speak this be the right construction assault be a standard common law concept and no other definition have be adopt by the guideline or commentary either explicitly or by cross reference even so the question remain whether his conduct be felonious assault at all and on this issue here primarily turn on the scienter require for assault the aggravate assault guideline and its commentary provide no answer the district court believe that the term assault in the guideline should be read as a reference to common law criminal assault and the statute itself do not define the term assault nor be it clear that the case law interpret the statute construe the term in any way that would assist we in resolve the matter before we the district court 's factual finding so far as they go can not be impeach under the clearly erroneous standard that apply to they at sentencing the government seek a three level upward adjustment for lee under u.s.s.g. the argument for look to this definition be that u.s.s.g. in the kind of assault by menace case likely to be prosecute the defendant usually 1 do have a purpose to cause fear or 2 be so aware that his action will cause fear and be otherwise so blameworthy- -that no one much trouble about his lack of purpose lee urge the use of this definition in interpret the guideline at issue here because he fall outside of the first two category forget that he may qualify under the third for both branch of assault and the authority often do not distinguish the most common formulation that intent be require rely on a term notoriously unclear in distinguish between purpose to cause a result and mere knowledge of ordinary consequence however because lee be already subject to a relate state sentence the court impose a consecutive sentence of only 42 month that may be all the commentary mean in say that the conduct trigger the three level adjustment be tantamount to aggravate assault thus while we still think that the common law definition of assault should generally govern the guideline whenever it supply an answer that definition do not clearly resolve the question what degree of scienter be require here awareness of consequence or something more purposeful after a minute or two the officer handcuff lee and find a loaded gun in his front waistband after his indictment and plea of guilty to be a felon in possession lee be sentence on january 11 1999 on april 26 1998 sergeant bulman of the boston police department assist in a traffic stop of a car in which lee be a passenger

and the first and fourteenth amendments it ask the federal district court to declare section 38 2 6 unconstitutional as violative of the free speech right of the association its member and rhode island real estate licensee in general and to enjoin the then attorney general jeffrey pine from enforce the ban on commercial solicitation the threat however must be credible in an effort to sustain it the attorney general point to several statement indicate with vary degree of certitude that the association 's plan activity fall outside the scope of section 38 2 6 consistent with this understanding the state defendant include the attorney general take the position that the challenge section do not apply to issue advocacy a showing that the challenged statute fairly read thwart implementation of the plan add the element of hardship in opposition the attorney general confine his argument to the threshold question of justiciability he embellish both of the contention delineate in the motion to dismiss suggest that the court should defer to his interpretation of the challenged law and allege a lack of state action sufficient to support a claim under 42 u.s.c. so too the proscription element because the plain language of section 38 2 6 pretermits commercial solicitation in the attorney general 's view section 38 2 6 be more akin to a self execute statute of limitation than to a probate nonclaim statute and thus do not involve state action respond to a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief file by the rhode island association of realtors the association the district court grant the request remedy rule that the operation of the statute abridge the association 's right to free expression we reiterate only the bottom line when deal with pre enforcement challenge to recently enact or at least non moribund statute that facially restrict expressive activity by the class to which the plaintiff belong court will assume a credible threat of prosecution in the absence of compelling contrary evidence thus the attorney general far from eschew enforcement place an imprimatur upon the provision bar the use of public record for commercial solicitation at the moment of this action 's conception the association have stand to challenge the commercial solicitation provision of r.i. gen. laws 38 2 6 and it properly employ 42 u.s.c. a. v. pope 485 u.s. 478 1988

injury in fact requirement for standing factor into both branch of the ripeness equation furthermore the association challenge not the mere enactment of section 38 2 6 but the combination of the section 's proscriptive language and the credible threat that the state will enforce it despite this overlap we assume favorably to the attorney general that both stand and ripeness be contest here the instant statute be unambiguous and therefore not readily susceptible to a narrow construction this statement send a clear message that in april of 1994 the attorney general deem section 38 2 6 to be alive and well see e.g. lugar v. edmondson oil co. 457 u.s. 922 937 1982 state that an allege constitutional deprivation cause by a rule of conduct impose by the state can satisfy the state action requirement 1998 cert the rhode island attorney general appeal insist that the association lack stand to challenge the law here then the first explanation seem by far the most plausible especially since the association provide uncontradicted affidavit support for the proposition that section 38 2 6 act as a deterrent in contrast to standing the burden of establish mootness rest on the party raise the issue moreover the cautious phrasing of the attorney general 's statement e.g. do not appear be a far cry from a flat commitment not to prosecute in this particular instance file u.s.l.w. as a matter of longstanding policy the attorney general do not issue advisory opinion to private party so that option be not open to the association because construe the statute to exempt the association 's plan activity require discard wholesale the prohibition on commercial solicitation the only practical way for the attorney general to assuage a reasonable fear of prosecution would be to disclaim in categorical term any intent to enforce the prohibition on commercial solicitation section 38 2 6 be regulatory in nature prohibit precisely the conduct that the association wish to undertake and set severe sanction for noncompliance although no person have ever be charge criminally under section 38 2 6 the attorney general have never disclaim it and a related provision section 38 2 8 require

practically nil this of course be fatal to appellant 's claim rather the only inference this evidence support be that appellant be not aware of all of the fact surround the arson investigation until 1997 when he receive discovery in the sklut case next appellant contend that the august 1994 investigation and incident reports which discuss breen as a suspect exhibits a and i and the property detail list exhibit h be fabricate and that louison know or should have know of the fabrication specifically in his affidavit in opposition to summary judgment appellant aver at most that louison know that appellant be an arson co defendant along with robert breen we do not think that these fact view in the light most hospitable to appellant be sufficient to enable a finding favorable to appellant

november 1992 in support of its claim that the gsa arbitrarily reclassify relocation expense as reestablishment expense the cruise line rely on the audit itself which conclude that $ 23,903 of the total propose amount be actual pay or incurred expense and be allocable to the permanent relocation of the claimant subsequent to the audit a gsa contracting officer increase the award by $ 452.03 and the cruise line receive benefit of $ 13,352.03 although ultimately unsuccessful the gsa in coordination with anthony athanas one of the principal of the fan pier land company assist the cruise line in its search for a new location specifically by engage the service of a harbor consultant and by contact the world trade center regardless of the hardship to the cruise line that result from its forced relocation from fan pier short of evidence that the gsa 's decision in this case be arbitrary and capricious we have no choice but to sustain the district court 's decision that the gsa 's award be base on a reasonable interpretation of the regulation during that time it refuse to accept the prospect of increase rent and face the reality of relocation apparently determine to remain in possession of the premise in may 1994 the gsa refer the claim to its office of the inspector general for an internal audit and review which be complete on august 2 1994 the act also require that the displace agency take measure to 2 provide current and continue information on the availability sale price and rental charge unfortunately the appellant overlook the distinction in posture between pou pacheco and the current case and its effect on the standard of review and deference that we afford to the agency 's award nevertheless the provision also permit the gsa to determine whether the fee be reasonable the regulation entitle the cruise line to reimbursement for actual expense not to exceed $ 1,000 as the agency determine to be reasonable which be incur in search for a replacement location likewise the reestablishment expense be reduce to reflect the $ 10,000 cap while we be unable to find an affirmative definition of current and continue assistance in either the statute the interpreting regulation or the case law at least two circuit have conclude that a displace agency need not obtain or tender a replacement location to adequately meet its burden under the uniform relocation act we find that the jury and the court be free to fashion the special relief they do due to the delicate nature of the displace business and the fact that the business remain inoperable we note however that the appellant have pull the first sentence of a paragraph out of context in pietroniro the third circuit find that reference to five alternative location and several local realtor satisfy the ura despite the fact that none of the location be economically feasible on that issue we come to the fact of this case with a clean slate and agree with our colleague on the third and fourth circuits that the government need not provide a suitable alternate location but rather must advise displace business of the availability of such site the appellant primarily challenge the gsa award of relocation benefit on two ground 1 the gsa fail to provide the relocation assistance require by law thereby necessitate appellant 's interim move to commercial wharf and 2 the gsa arbitrarily and capriciously reclassify relocation expense so that they would fall within the regulatory cap for search and reestablishment expense we make no finding that the government fail to meet its burden under the ura and set no standard by which to measure the adequacy of the government 's assistance on february 15 1993 the cruise line file a claim with the gsa request relocation benefit in the amount of $ 80,017.05 and relocation assistance as provide for in the uniform relocation act the gsa rely on the audit exclude the attorney 's search fee because they exceed the $ 1000 cap which have already be meet and because the attorney 's rate of $ 135 hr be unreasonable although we take a broad approach to apply the statutory requirement of the ura in pou pacheco our opinion be by no mean inconsistent with the view of the third and fourth circuits the appellant suggest capriciousness in the audit 's decision to reclassify the expense for the purpose of maintain the integrity of the regulatory limitation to the contrary the cruise line admit that the gsa 's referral may fairly represent then exist available facility in apply the arbitrary and capricious standard the task of the review court be to determine whether the agency consider the pertinent evidence and relative factor and sufficiently articulate an explanation for its action the cruise line primarily contest the reclassification of expense the interim move the uniform relocation act provide for payment to displace person of actual reasonable expense incur in move a business search for a new location and reestablish the business at the new location we find however that the gsa consider the pertinent evidence and factor and articulate an explanation for its action which fall well within the bound of reason decision making as the gsa 's decision be consistent with the regulation we defer to the gsa 's judgment the plaintiff appellant a.c. cruise line inc. cruise line seek review of an award provide by the general services administration gsa allege that the relocation assistance it receive be far short of fair and equitable treatment because we find that the gsa 's decision be a reasonable application of the regulation we affirm see 764 f.2d at 981 see also american dry cleaners 722 f.2d at 71 find referral to many possible relocation site none of which be acceptable to the displace business sufficient assistance under the ura it also include modification to the personal property necessary to adapt it to the replacement structure the replacement site or the utility at the replacement site and modification necessary to adapt the utility at the replacement site to the personal property discussion the main thrust of appellant 's claim be that the gsa fail to provide adequate relocation assistance cause the appellant to incur unusual relocation expense instead the cruise line hang its hat on the argument that under pou pacheco the regulatory cap be guideline only and can be exceed if there be evidence of unusual expense the appellant insist that its interim move be necessitate by the gsa 's failure to provide current and continue assistance within the meaning

that the vessel which dump the bale between the hour of 2:57 a.m. and 3:03 a.m. be the same vessel upon which the defendant be find when it be ram at approximately 3:30 a.m. approximately one and a half 1 1/2 mile off of cabo san juan fajardo light house at the conclusion of trial defendant submit the follow special charge on theories of defense also as it relate to the fact and evidence in this case the government must specifically prove beyond a reasonable doubt that thirty- one 31 bale be throw overboard from a vessel approximately 18 to 20 nautical mile n.e. however the defendant be not entitle to a verbatim reading of the request instruction and the court need not instruct on every particular that conceivably might be of interest to the jury defendant be the only three individual aboard the vessel that carry the cocaine and as the district court find there be little or no evidence that one of the defendant be comparatively less culpable than the other two finally the district court find that defendant be not prejudice by the government 's failure to disclose the log because the information to which defendant be entitle be make available to they through other mean namely the reporting datum and flir videotape from omaha 13 omaha 85 and hawk 514 we instruct the district court to review the sector log as well as any other potentially relevant log to determine 1 whether the log should have be disclose under rule 16 brady or the jencks act and 2 if so whether the government 's failure to disclose the log materially prejudice the defense on this basis the district court likely could have give the detailed case specific instruction that the defendant request or otherwise simplify the somewhat prolix and repetitive history of fact critical to identify defendant vessel as the culprit defendant argue that 1 the unreliable dog sniff evidence should have be exclude under federal rule of evidence 403 because its probative value be substantially outweigh by the danger of unfair prejudice and 2 the court should have allow defendant counsel to voir dire the canine 's handler agent rafael ocasio cruz outside the presence of the jury defendant do not challenge the district court 's finding regard the calmness of the room the explanation of defendant right or the step take to ensure that defendant understand those right and we agree with each of those finding defendant contend that the sole purpose of this testimony be to frighten the jury infuse emotional bias and improperly instill the desire to convict to the extent that defendant argue that the district court be influence by the amount of the control substance to sentence they at the upper end of the guideline range we offer two response we then note that in an attempt to resolve the discovery issue on appeal the government submit a copy of what it claim to be the only relevant log the october 17 1996 morning log of the united states command center sector for united states customs sector under brady they must demonstrate a reasonable probability that have the evidence be disclose to the defense the result of the proceeding would have be different thus the court state quite accurately and impartially that the case deal with drug not that the defendant do while in ask its clarify question the district court may have raise issue that defendant would rather the jury not focus on it can not be say that the district court do so to benefit the government to the extent that this be an argument that the court 's deterrence concern result in a high end sentence we again lack jurisdiction see panet- collazo 960 f.2d at 261 and we again fail to share defendant outrage over the use of this factor these instruction adequately cover the substance of the propose instruction that the government must prove that it be defendant and not the crew of some other nearby vessel that possess the bale of cocaine impartiality of the district court 's instruction to the jury at the end of the fifth day of trial defendants claim that the district court 's may 16 1997 instruction advise the jury not to discuss the case communicate to the jury the court 's belief that defendant be guilty conclusion base on the foregoing we affirm the judgment of the district court thus we retain jurisdiction of the case and remand to the district court for the resolution of several discovery issue far if you find that the government can not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the vessel upon which the defendant be find could have attain and sustain the average speed require for it to have travel from the approximate point where the bale be reportedly drop to the approximate point where the defendant 's vessel be ram then you must find they not guilty and acquit each one of they of the offense and charge bring against they 3e1.1 application note 2 this adjustment be not intend to apply to a defendant who put the government to its burden of proof at trial by deny the essential factual element of guilt be convict and only then admit guilt and express remorse because the appellant have not demonstrate prejudice from the government 's failure to disclose the log and in light of the substantial evidence support the jury 's guilty verdict we affirm the district court 's ruling we observe that because the district court deny discovery of the log base on either relevance or the need for confidentiality the district court do not determine whether the log be require to be disclose under fed because the government have to prove that the defendant possess the thirty one bale of cocaine on the high sea this be essentially a correct statement of the government 's burden in this case in that opinion we reject defendant challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence but we find ourselves unable to properly assess defendant claim of discovery violation on the exist record refusal to allow voir dire of agent ocasio cruz in the conclusion to the section of their brief arguing that the district court err in admit the dog sniff testimony defendant baldly assert that the court also abuse its discretion by not permit defendant to voir dire agent ocasio cruz outside the presence of the jury because we find that the testimony be properly admit and because we find that the jury be not subject to inappropriate argument we reject defendant argument that the district court should have allow they to voir dire agent ocasio cruz outside the presence of the jury after monitor the suspect vessel for almost two hour with the assistance of a united states army national guard helicopter the government agent illuminate the suspect vessel and spot its crew dump bale which later prove to contain cocaine into the ocean similarly we find here that the district court appropriately question the defense expert while manage to preserve an attitude of impartiality however while much of the shock value come from the magnitude of the offense the spin the government attempt to put on the offense by attach the mammoth street value price tag certainly add perhaps unnecessarily to that shock value defendant offer little argument regard the opposite side of the rule 403 equation unfair prejudice confusion of the issue or the potential for mislead the jury however we be reluctant to require the district court to engage in such semantic hair splitting especially in the absence of a contemporaneous objection there be limitation place on the trial judge 's comment to prevent the judge from assume the role of a witness mislead the jury or distort or add to the evidence deny 516 u.s. 1139 1996 and similar case from other circuit the government counter that such evidence of street pricing be routinely admit by court in order to prove the intent to distribute 1989 we uphold the constitutionality of 3e1.1 against a challenge bring under the fifth amendment state that the sentencing guidelines merely codify a tradition of leniency and be not an impermissible burden on the exercise of constitutional right the instruction deliver to the jury do fairly present defendant wrong boat defense and the propose instruction be not essential to the effective presentation of that defense the record amply demonstrate that appellant be not impede in the presentation of their defense and the substantial other evidence present at trial be such that the mere possibility of additional exculpatory evidence in the log be insufficient to call into doubt the fairness of appellant trial or the verdict reach by the jury the district court instruct the jury that the government have to prove that the defendant knowingly and intentionally possess the cocaine with the intent to distribute it we also recognize the possibility that the district court deny discovery of the log base on the need for confidentiality rather than because the log be irrelevant and we express reluctance to accept the government 's stated concern for confidentiality as a basis for deny discovery of the log whatever our nagging doubt regard the completeness of the information produce to appellant by other mean we be in complete agreement with the district court that appellant be not prejudice by the failure to produce the log give the testimony to the contrary this argument be equally unsuccessful in demonstrate clear error in the district court 's finding of attempt to escape we do not agree that the district court 's perhaps imprecise choice of word communicate to the jury a belief that the defendant be guilty beyond that however the trial judge may exercise her discretion in how good to assist the jury the sole basis offer by the united states for resist disclosure be the desire to maintain the secrecy of the log code name an objective that could have be easily and effectively achieve through redaction without deprive the appellant of information to which they be entitle under the rules of criminal procedure and federal case law and although confusing defendant do present evidence that their vessel could not have be the vessel track by the government agent between 1:11 a.m. and 2:50 a.m. due to the sea condition and the maximum sustainable speed of defendant vessel defendant complain that the court 's interference rise to the level of advocacy and deny they a fair trial by communicate to the jury that the court have take a side although we be sympathetic to the difficulty of demonstrate how information might have aid one 's case without ever see that information or even know that it exist some showing albeit imperfect must be make before an appellate court can reverse the reason decision of the trial court and appellant have offer we nothing of any substance upon which to hang our proverbial hat nor do the district court abandon its impartiality by rehabilitate the previous testimony of government witness or emphasize point helpful to the prosecution to the extent that it actually engage in either activity after all it be at least possible that gator alert to the presence of a different control substance than the cocaine find to have be dump in the ocean that day

view proceeding in the record in light of this considerable evidence link appellant to the crime and the negligible effect of the court 's instruction that the view be not evidence we conclude that any error in the treatment of the view must be deem harmless 1992 footnote omit see also wigmore on evidence 1168 at 385 86 the suggestion that in a view or any other mode of inspection by the jury they be merely ` enable well to comprehend the testimony and do not consult an additional source of knowledge be simply not correct in fact certain of the safeguard we outline in clemente respond to these concern include the recommendation that the judge be present and that limit be place on the interaction between counsel the subject of the view and the juror instead the court advise the juror that their view of the bank and surround area be not evidence explain that it be intend simply to provide you with point of reference or a context in which to consider the evidence in this case although such a record may not capture every nuance of the experience that difficulty be equally applicable to other kind of evidence a witness countenance tone of voice mode and manner of expression and general demeanor on the stand oftentime influence the jury as much in estimate the weight they give and attach to his testimony as the word he utter and yet they can not be send up with the record

because he twist his ankle along the way 628 631 1917 quote in maguire at 141 n.3 if the object be black when see by the jury it would be absurd to expect they to find that it be white in the absence of evidence indicate that they have be impose upon the nature of the view although our unconditional statement in clemente that a jury view do not itself constitute or generate evidence may represent the majority position see 52 f.3d at 386 amp n.3 the momentum appear to be head in the opposite direction the evidence that appellant commit the bank robbery include the testimony of eight witness who identify he in a bank surveillance photograph include his mother in law and brother in law the latter of whom call police to report that the robber be gray after see a televise picture of the suspect but even if the court 's instruction on the view be error it must be deem harmless because as we shall explain it foreclose very little benefit from the view that a permissive instruction would have allow and because the testimonial evidence point so overwhelmingly to the appellant 's guilt as we explain below gray be able to rely on other evidence to attempt to show his inability to traverse the difficult terrain of the robber 's getaway path and though the view be not treat as evidence the juror exposure to the scene presumably influence their evaluation of what they see and hear in the courtroom as we acknowledge early in conclude that a view may constitute evidence the distinction between context and evidence be likely to be lose on the jury in the ordinary case moreover the fact that we now regard a view to be within the category of admissible evidence not only endow a trial court with the same discretion to control its admission that the court have in deal with all evidentiary matter but also may in the future require special technique and practice as experience indicate three longtime friend also be among those who identify he in the surveillance photograph and

unsound theory that a view do not involve the consideration of evidence by the jury and note that it have in most jurisdiction be repudiate however we believe such a distinction be only semantic because any kind of presentation to the jury or the judge to help the fact finder determine what the truth be and assimilate and understand the evidence be itself evidence our holding thus increase the range of admissible evidence but leave intact the district court 's authority to refuse a view in particular case or to exclude a view or portion of it from evidence when an on the- scene observation do not transpire as the court have anticipate on appeal gray argue that the language in clemente be dictum and therefore not bind and that in any event it be illogical as well as incorrect by contemporary standard to exclude a view from consideration as evidence the district court grant gray 's unopposed motion seek to allow the jury to view the bank and the robber 's escape route but refuse his request instruction that the jury consider the view as evidence defendant 's assertion that the juror observation at the scene be not capture equivalently by the photograph and other trial evidence while perhaps true thus miss the point finally when gray be arrest at a manchester new hampshire hotel a week after the robbery a newspaper clip that name he as a suspect be find on the night stand between the two bed in his room the juror essentially be encourage to bring to mind what they have see when review evidence include the photograph relate to the difficulty of the terrain 1995 we state that the rule in this circuit be that a view do not itself constitute or generate evidence i d. we agree that it be unlikely that juror confront with testimonial evidence at odd with what they have see will apply the metaphysical distinction suggest and ignore the evidence of their own sense mccormick on evidence 216 at 29 see mccormick on evidence 216 at 29 the preferable position be that a view be evidence like any other 22 charles alan wright amp kenneth w. graham jr. federal practice and procedure 5176 at 141 1978 the notion that a view be not evidence have be discredit by the writer and explicitly reject by one modern code in reality the district court 's directive that the jury could use the view as a context for consider other evidence provide appellant with you all he could have expect from use the view as direct evidence at 394 396 p]roper judicial administration demand the presence and supervision of the judge at the view in addition considerable evidence point to appellant as the bank robber he approach the center teller window pull a bag from under the sweatshirt and say this be no joke give i your money indeed most of the usual commentator on matter of evidence either question the rationale for exclude view from evidentiary status observe that that position have lose favor or both the degree by which treatment of the view as evidence rather than context would have strengthen appellant 's case be thus minimal particularly in light of the substantial evidence of his guilt to which we now turn other evidence of the terrain the view in this case although the district court in this case exclude the view from evidence without consider whether it satisfy the standard requirement of admissibility its decision do not require reversal of appellant 's conviction because any error unquestionably be harmless of obvious importance be the court 's responsibility to ensure that what transpire at the view be fully and accurately record most likely by a court reporter perhaps the most compelling and pragmatic observation be that the distinction between non evidence that aid a jury 's understanding and traditional independent evidence be lose on a jury see 2 weinstein 's federal evidence 403.07[4 we emphasize that by recognize that the information obtain through a view may constitute independent evidence at trial we do not diminish the trial

the ground inter alia that the three meeting requirement be invalid finally if steelworker be take to impose a rigid one factor test base on percentage much of the opinion become surplusage particularly the section in which the court approve the secretary 's own flexible multi factor test for reasonableness for example one would need to know just how inconvenient be attendance for member of a particular union which depend on the location(s of meeting the hour and length of the meeting the distance from home or job of the member and so on and whether there be other incentive for member to attend meeting as well as the nature and operation of any excuse regime obviously we do not commit ourselves as to the outcome but with a clear cut regulation adopt by the secretary in place of the current straddle this would at least be a close contest true the secretary 's brief read steelworker as make conclusive the percentage of member exclude but while the dissent opinion in that case so accuse the majority steelworkers 429 u.s. at 315 powell j. dissent the majority avoid any such explicit holding i d. the text of the regulation continue to assert that attendance requirement may be reasonable and that reasonableness must be gauge in the light of the circumstance of the particular case include among other consideration burden excuse provision and impact still the court have purport to make reasonableness a case specific issue turn on all of the circumstance e.g. steelworkers 429 u.s. at 313 local 1402 int'l longshoremen 's ass'n 617 f.2d at 98 99 and the secretary say that attendance requirement can serve legitimate end in ensure that candidate be educate about union affair the main datum rely on by the secretary be the fact concede by the union that over 96 percent of the member of the local in this case do not in practice attend enough meeting to qualify to run for office in sum if the secretary have the courage of her counsel 's conviction she can revise her interpretative regulation adopt a flat percentage test and eventually bring an enforcement action outside the d.c. instead the secretary 's attack on the district court decision rest almost entirely on the allege impact of the attendance requirement in this case on her reading of case law and on the deference she say be due to her judgment the union support by a very helpful amicus brief from another union the united steelworkers support the district court 's decision the statutory reasonableness test in section 481(e do not have much inherent content but as already note the main thrust of the decision implement it be to consider election- qualification requirement on a case by case basis take account of all relevant factor and not just one for that reason the secretary and the court have approach skeptically qualification requirement of the kind at issue in this case thus in her most recent formal statement of position the secretary have seek to have it both way support the union position in text but append a footnote reference to doyle that be more of a disclosure than an endorsement the union which be a springfield massachusetts local of the american postal workers union hold officer election once every three year indeed as doyle make clear the secretary previously share our view of the steelworkers decision by the standard of prior decision the qualification requirement in this case be certainly at the less burdensome end of the spectrum the union hold meeting nine month of the year all month but july august and december so to be eligible a candidate must attend one third of the nine schedule meeting as the number of exclude member go up so do the court readiness to find that the burden outweigh the suppose and inherently speculative benefit of the requirement in educate the candidate or demonstrate commitment allege such a violation the secretary seek to set aside the election the secretary have appeal stress that the requirement disqualify over 96 percent of the union membership under its constitution a candidate for office must have be a member of the union for at least one year two if run for president and this be the dispute provision must have attend at least three of the local 's regular monthly meeting in the twelve month period before the meeting at which nomination be make but to make a percentage test conclusive be not the most natural reading of the statute or the govern precedent and there be doubt about the secretary 's own position outside of this litigation on cross motion for summary judgment the district court rule in favor of the union after conclude that the three- meeting requirement be a reasonable qualification under section 481(e suppose that the union require all candidate to send in a postcard 10 day before the election or to collect three signature prior to the election probably at least 96 percent of the membership would on the day of the election still be disqualify from run for office but the amicus offer some commentary to the contrary-- principally a statement by former labor secretary ray marshall an expert in labor matter and more important the secretary do not assert that all meet attendance requirement be a useless sham or point we to any evidence to support such a position the secretary thereafter bring suit against the union in the district court under the lmrda 29 u.s.c. despite the able argument of the amicus union we do not attach much weight to the prevalence of such meeting attendance requirement in the past a past not without abuse or to congress 's failure to ban they outright which fall far short of implicit approval 1987 a divide panel overturn the secretary 's refusal to sue to enjoin a meeting attendance requirement obligate a candidate to attend at least one half of the monthly meeting in the prior year far the fact in doyle address a requirement somewhat more burdensome than the one before we compelling attendance at six meeting instead of three and a head start of about six month instead of four this be not the most natural or traditional reading of the statute but there be policy arguments- -a few already mention for this result assume as we do that the statute afford some latitude for the expert administrator to devise an enforceable regime instead the court have concern themselves primarily with evaluate the extent of the burden impose by the requirement at issue and their impact on candidacy only in the new case law footnote at the end do the secretary cite doyle say that the exclusion of a large portion of member alone may render an attendance requirement unreasonable at 310 13 and the fact of the case involve a requirement-- attend one half the monthly meeting in the prior three years-- that be far more burdensome than the requirement at issue in this case in the absence of such evidence court tend to make what they think be common sense judgment base on how many meeting member must attend over what period of time whether excuse be allow and how long in advance a candidate would have to decide to run in order to fulfil the condition this bring we to the secretary 's more interesting argument namely that her present position on what be a reasonable qualification be entitle to substantial deference from the court reverse the district court 's approach let we begin with burden and return then to impact which present the more difficult issue in this case put differently when the nomination meeting arrive less than 4 percent of the local 's membership could run for office chevron u.s.a.

and suffering be unreasonably low the record be unclear as to the reason for the limitation and as to whether it remain in effect on the accident date may 21 1993 at the time of the accident malone do in fact have a certificate of insurance on file with the illinois commerce commission in the interim malone attempt unsuccessfully to reach washington by telephone although it be able to reach washington 's wife and inform she that the lease have be cancel in any event malone believe that washington have breach the lease upon reconsideration however the court grant summary judgment in favor of etc for the foregoing reason the judgment be affirm in connection with the execution of this early lease washington have present to malone a transcript date august 5 1992 of his drive record from his home state florida second graham argue that the district court 's $ 40,000 award for pain and suffering be unreasonable because it be equal only to the amount of lose earning through the date of judgment once the lease be cancel washington cease to operate under malone 's authority on its behalf or with its permission on august 6 1992 the state of florida issue a conditional driver 's license to washington valid only as to haul within florida explanation for various such code appear however at the bottom of the august 5 transcript in its memorandum and order the district court after address several thorny choice of law issue grant summary judgment in favor of malone finally the court conclude that any negligence by ect in fail to determine whether washington have icc authority to transport good interstate be not a proximate cause of graham 's injury such authority not be necessary for the transport of agricultural product an explanation of the ab2 restriction appear in the florida transcript of washington 's drive record upon which malone have rely when it enter into the lease with washington while washington himself apparently never receive notice of cancellation we conclude as have other court that the presence of malone 's icc placard do not vitiate the otherwise valid termination notice the amount of damage award fall within the sound discretion of the fact finder here the district court we affirm the judgment of the district court for the foregoing reason we conclude that the district court do not err in grant summary judgment in favor of malone on all claim against it as we be review a grant of summary judgment in favor of ect we shall assume that ect do not contact malone prior to the may 21 1993 haul to inquire as to washington 's status washington return the material on july 17 1993 because the lease have be cancel before the accident washington 's truck be no long operate by or under authority of malone malone base in birmingham alabama be an interstate motor carrier engage in the business of transport freight via truck under the jurisdiction grant formerly by the interstate commerce commission we recite in the light most favorable to graham only those fact most pertinent to our discussion of the issue on appeal when washington leave malone 's office on april 15 1993 he have with he various vehicle identification material provide by malone include door placard for the tractor in malone 's name decal for the tractor trailer with malone 's icc number a cab card that indicate washington have malone 's permission to operate under its icc authority decal with malone assign number and forty eight state decal indicate that applicable state taxis have be pay the written notice cancellation method provide for in the lease seem a practicable and sensible arrangement for party like washington and malone where washington be likely to spend much of his time out on the road deliver load after washington and sabree default the district court enter judgment against they and after review documentary evidence of graham 's injury award graham $ 111,300 in damage of which $ 40,000 be for pain and suffering graham allege that malone be also liable for her injury because it 1 negligently entrust the tractor trailer to washington despite the intrastate limitation that appear on the face of his driver 's license 2 fail to cancel the tractor trailer 's illinois registration prior to the accident and 3 act as washington 's statutory employer because washington 's truck bore malone 's icc vehicle identification insignia at the time of the accident and still carry the illinois vehicle registration on april 15 1993 malone obtain a 45 day temporary permit for the tractor trailer which be valid until may 30 1993 the may 21 1993 haul be the fifth washington have transport for ect washington have begin accept assignment from ect on april 20 1993 far the limitation appear to be tie into the existence of other valid licensure elsewhere
121	121	198769.json	 to determine the voluntariness of a waiver it be necessary to look at the totality of the circumstance see arizona v. fulminante 499 u.s. 279 285 1991 include the tactic use by the police the detail of the interrogation and any characteristic of the accuse that might cause his will easily to be overborne the trial court credit the confession because the defendant 's tone clarity and detailed recall of the robbery as set forth in the confession support a finding of lucidity the defendant be then ask to and do initial the print version of each right on the waiver form the district court find that the lie though admittedly a ploy be not do with foreknowledge of the defendant 's history the detective concede that the characterization be a lie but deny any knowledge of the defendant 's history of molestation the sufficiency of the conspiracy evidence defendant be charge under the hobbs act 19 u.s.c. 1982 prosecutor 's statement that victim seat in the audience await the truth and the jury verdict do not call for a new trial during the discussion the prosecutor acknowledge that his evidence show that defendant be an aider and abettor not the principal as the indictment charge 1981 court should consider the age experience education background intelligence and conduct of the defendant later at the beginning of the tape record segment of the confession the previous waiver process be recount and palmer again state that he want to voluntarily waive his miranda right 1998 in which we say we assess the sufficiency of the evidence as a whole include all reasonable inference in the light most favorable to the verdict with a view to whether a rational trier of fact could have find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt defense counsel also object to the prosecution 's characterization of the element of conspiracy the judge 's demand that the defense counsel sit down after make the objection and the prosecution 's characterization of the evidence at the close of the government 's case defendant move to dismiss because of the difference between the government 's proof and the wording of the substantive count first that the defendant know that robbery be to be commit or be be commit by talbot curtain sic second that the defendant knowingly do some act for the purpose of aid the commission of that crime and third that the defendant act with the intention of cause the crime charge to be commit the aiding and abet statute it be not necessary for the government to show that the defendant himself physically commit the crime charge for the duration of the car trip no question be ask of the defendant the court also hold that the defendant be not threaten with consequence of fail to speak nor do the police tactic create a sense of urgency the court then instruct with respect to count 3 6 and 7 the government contend that the defendant aid and abet talbot curtain sic in commit the robbery allege in these count indeed the tape portion of the interview indicate a very cooperative relation between the interrogating police and the defendant the substantive count in the indictment counts three six and seven charge that the defendant do commit each robbery and be aid and abet by talbot timothy curtin here the comment occur during the middle of the government 's closing argument not during rebuttal see connelly 479 u.s. at 170 the voluntariness of a waiver of this privilege have always depend on the absence of police overreach not on free choice in any broad sense of the word the prosecutor 's comment palmer claim that his right to due process confrontation and a fair trial by an impartial jury be violate when the prosecutor during closing argument make reference to his own personal belief and appeal to those of the jury to explain the witness 's decision to record palmer 's confession but not the entire custodial interrogation accord to defendant 's statement to the police curtin want the robbery limit to store in which a woman be the sole employee on the premise and there be not many customer in the parlance of the street the conspirator be a couple of junkie hook on heroin and crack cocaine because if i bring a defendant or a witness or anybody else into the room and i sit he down and say okay we be go to talk about robbery and press the button to the taperecorder the first thing that happen they be go to shut up and not go to talk the detective who be experience in identify substance abuser testify that the defendant appear clear headed curtin decide base on the number of car park in front of the store that there be too many people present for the robbery to be carry out the defendant be tell to read the form and then ask if he understand it defendant drive curtin to jeannotte 's market the store describe in the count on february 4 1998 the same day defendant drive curtin to the shell station describe in the count with the intent that curtin would rob it if his predetermine condition be meet after the jury advise the court that it have reach a verdict and return to the courtroom the clerk ask how do the jury find the defendant charles palmer not guilty or guilty as to each count in the indictment en route to the police station palmer who have not be give notice of his miranda right emphatically and loudly deny any involvement in the robbery and accuse the detective of lack any evidence to demonstrate otherwise if a defendant can be convict of aid and abet without be so charge in the indictment we can not find that defendant here be deprive of a fair trial because he be convict of be an aider and abettor even though charge as the principal when the evidence establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he drive the get away vehicle while his partner in crime commit the robbery charge we note certain relevant finding of the district court the officer appear to be professional and there be no indication that the officer be rude abrasive or forceful the court agree with the prosecutor and rely on our opinion in united states v. sanchez 917 f.2d 607 1st cir on march 20 1998 the defendant be arrest at his home by member of the nashua police department include detective richard sprankle pursuant to an arrest warrant for robbery at the police station the defendant be book accord to standard operating procedure the evidence as to count one be that on february 4 1998 defendant drive curtin to the describe mobil station convenience store though court must presume that a defendant do not waive his right see jackson 918 f.2d at 241 the government may prove a waiver by a preponderance of the evidence the government prove the opposite that curtin commit the robbery aid and abet by defendant who drive the get away vehicle the district court be not require to credit the appellant 's version of the event the indictment be send to the jury in response sprankle repeatedly tell the defendant to shut up and indicate that the police have an incriminate confession from talbot timmy curtin implicate palmer in the robbery palmer point to the follow circumstance he be a heroin addict in withdrawal and under the influence of anti depressant at the time of his interrogation he be not read the miranda right upon arrest his request to speak to an attorney be deny he be a victim of child molestation and the police admittedly and intentionally lie about talbot timmy curtin the defendant 's co- conspirator be a child molester there be three material element of the offense of aid and abet the commission of a crime each of which the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to each of count 3 6 and 7 in order for you to find the defendant guilty in this case one factor suggest such reasonable belief be the fact that the condition be meet in two other case and when they be meet the defendant carry out the robbery because the essence of a conspiracy be an agreement see united states v. miranda ortiz 926 f.2d 172 175 2nd cir 1991 a failure to achieve the objective even if factually impossible be not a defense palmer argue that the judge 's curative instruction sandwich between the government 's and defendant 's closing argument be insufficient because it do not immediately follow the misconduct

appleman insurance law and practice 3083 at 311 1970 discuss fire insurance and the case usually but perhaps not always see jussim v. massachusetts bay ins the court hold that an insurance policy exclusion for corrosion negate coverage where the support steel in a parking facility deteriorate after exposure to ice water and de icing salt carry in by car i d. one might think that construe a maritime insurance policy in relation to damage occur on the high sea would be a paradigm case for a uniform body of federal law see gilmore amp black supra 1 17 at 49 the district court point out that the policy cover all risk of physical loss or damage to the cargo from any external cause but be subject to a specific exclusion however as respect steel product and all metal exclude rusting oxidation discoloration and corrosion also exclude bending twisting crimping and end damage however massachusetts case law do offer a number of example include the burst pipe case describe above which be somewhat helpful to central even beyond their support for the view with which we agree that the presumptive literal reading be not always the one that prevail at 272 73 the court reject the insured 's claim that the true cause be the release of chloride ion which be not name as an excluded risk with the corrosion follow as a consequence i d. co. 307 n.e.2d 11 1973 where water from a burst pipe leak into and damage the basement of an adjoining building the policy on the latter building generally cover physical damage but specifically exclude water damage in various specify form e.g. flood underground seepage the other be that the full exclusion in this policy include some exclude harm e.g. bend of the steel that could rarely occur naturally in a voyage so central 's argument imply that one part of the exclusion be subject to an implicit limitation that could not be apply to the other part hardly a natural reading the well explanation where the insurer be hold liable appear to be that the court have choose to read the exclusion in context more narrowly than its literal language might suggest the attempt to give priority to the initial cover cause in the train of event over the exclude consequence be doubtful in principle even where the cover risk be narrowly define e.g. fire but it become absurd where the initial coverage be all risk since every exclude harm have some cause and it appear from the policy that the exclusion could have be modify although perhaps not to provide unlimited coverage for steel by payment of a high premium 1996 and we begin with the choice of law since massachusetts law in the end be no well for central than any federal precedent cite to we we like the district court need not pursue the matter the first be that the exclusion should apply only to naturally occur corrosion or discoloration say as a result of exposure to salt air and not to that produce by a fortuitous event like storm exposure or negligent stowage of adjacent cargo central 's other argument for coverage be that unless the exclusion be read narrowly the protection offer for steel shipment would be empty its premise be that the only foreseeable damage to steel on a sea voyage would be discoloration corrosion or some form of physical distortion cover by the above quote bend clause of the exclusion standard 307 n.e.2d at 12 13 -an insurer might specially wish to prevent such liability for natural corrosion but of course there be nothing in the policy to suggest such a limitation and at least two further argument exist against it normally specific language be treat as a limitation on general language and in this case fix the relationship of the two clause be make even easy because the all risk language in central 's policy be follow by the term h]owever which introduce the exclusion turn to the merit central must accept in light of its own affidavit that the harm to the steel coil manifest itself as corrosion and discoloration this be a recur issue and under ordinary principle of contract interpretation there be little doubt that the exclusion be presumptively a qualification on the risk coverage see keeton amp widiss supra 5.3(a c since corrosion and discoloration be the admit damage the district court find that the policy exclusion apply conversely at least for purpose of this appeal we must assume the truth of central 's claim that the anterior cause of the corrosion and discoloration be the exposure of the steel to improperly stow powder ash as well as to sea water and that unexpected storm condition at sea contribute to that exposure one be that some authority exist for exclude natural deterioration of ship good from coverage without a specific exclusion see keeton amp widiss supra 5.3(c which would make the express exclusion from corrosion redundant if it be read so narrowly what be confusing be the court 's reliance later in the opinion on an allege well establish principle that recovery be allow where the insured risk cause yet it be not true that all maritime loss as to steel would trigger the literal language of the exclusion if the ship sink in deep water the inability to recover the cargo would create a cover loss without regard to any corrosion or discoloration that might ensue far this policy be open embrace various kind of cargo that central might ship on different voyage the failure to provide much protection for steel do not render the policy generally useless curiously this straightforward approach be not always reflect in the case since we affirm the district court 's reading of the exclusion such an amendment would be futile whether or not consequential damage be consistent with maritime law they can hardly be award under this policy to offset the further consequence of an expressly exclude loss in april 1999 the district court file a decision grant amico 's motion for summary judgment and order dismissal of the complaint this marine insurance case which turn on the meaning of an exclusion for discoloration and corrosion begin with an ocean shipment make in december 1995 co. 610 n.e.2d 954 955 58 mass. suit on maritime insurance policy be classic example of matter within federal maritime jurisdiction see gilmore amp black the law of admiralty 1 10 at 22 n.71 2d ed although the reading often favor the insure imply exception to coverage be not unknown there be language in massachusetts decision as elsewhere that purport to treat a cover risk and an exclude consequence as legitimate rival whose priority be to be test by ask question about causation these discussion often in opinion with defensible result tend not to be very illuminating our review of a summary judgment be de novo eeoc v. green 76 f.3d 19 23 1st cir for simplicity we treat amico as the only defendant the initial direct loss independent of consequential damage be estimate by central at several hundred thousand dollar gilmore amp black supra 1 17 the judgment be affirm in this case central do make a pair of colorable argument for a narrow interpretation of the exclusion co. 7 f.3d 1047 1052 1st cir e.g. titan indem still there be nothing wrong with read policy language more narrowly or broadly than its literal wording might at first suggest where this well capture the reasonable expectation of the party the central object of all contract interpretation 99 1642 central

cab company the driver or the passenger to revoke the anticipatorily give consent in a give situation if after the stop the police see anything that look suspicious they may then get the passenger out of the cab indeed the passenger here have no option to terminate the seizure and so this situation be unlike the search in florida v. bostick 501 u.s. 429 436 37 1991 rather that decision be make for he by the taxicab owner and imputedly the driver.4 the panel opinion correctly point out that when the prosecution seek to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary consent it and in 1992 the supreme judicial court of massachusetts hold unconstitutional under the fourth amendment another policy of the boston police under which the police stop and search know or suspect gang member and their associate on sight.3 see commonwealth v. phillips 595 n.e.2d 310 314 16 mass. see e.g. randall kennedy race crime and the law 138- 63 1997 the very purpose of many constitutional guarantee particularly those contain in the fourth amendment be to fetter the exercise of discretion by the police although the passenger in enter a taxicab certainly relinquish some control over the technical driving decision of the taxicab driver the relationship be not like the sharing expect between housemate this be a seizure under the constitution as the government concede by its participation in tips the cab company consent to the police stop the cab the company 's consent can be attribute to the cab driver and from there consent can be impute to the passenger because of his decision to enter the cab thus effectively the cab company be permit to waive the fourth amendment right of citizen to be free from seizure -11- those situation the voluntariness of the consent be determine from the circumstance normally the government would need probable cause or at least reasonable suspicion of a crime to make such a stop in addition traffic stop in practice may be use as a pretext to investigate other crime because court will not usually inquire into the actual motive of the police when a passenger hire a taxicab the expectation be that the passenger assume control over all the important decision include the vehicle 's travel route should the passenger choose to specify and its ultimate destiny it be doubtful that a passenger through nothing more than this relationship with the taxicab driver -9- consent to the unfettered discretion of the police to stop the taxicab in order to make sure that he himself be not a dangerous criminal if the -3- police see that the passenger have something illicit here a gun the passenger may be arrest and the evidence seize but for the reason state i respectfully dissent from the denial of the petition for rehear en banc a police officer can stop a person base simply on reasonable suspicion see terry v. ohio 392 u.s. 1 30 1968 and in determine whether they have reasonable suspicion the police may consider the 3 as judge newman have say t]he risk inherent in such a practice be that some police officer will use the pretext of traffic violation or other minor infraction to harass member of group identify by factor that be totally impermissible as a basis for law enforcement activity factor such as race or ethnic origin or simply appearance that some police officer do not like such as young man with long hair heavy jewelry and flashy clothing these instruction be so broad that they most likely will not act as limit at all.6 in fact the legend on the decal may be the most accurate 6 a massachusetts superior court judge hold that almost identical instruction in a predecessor program to tips do not act to limit the arbitrary and unbridled discretion of the police officer accord to the panel a voluntary police sponsor program call the taxi inspection program for safety or tips justify this new rule the well analogy may be to a hotel room which like a cab be rent for sole occupancy for a period of time here by contrast the anticipatory consent to seize give by the cab company be open end the seizure may be at any time and under any circumstance begin in 1991 as operation taxi and modify in 1996 to become tips,1 the program be a well intentione response to a rash of attack and shooting some fatal of cab driver by passenger particularly in minority urban area if an open end anticipatory third party consent to the seizure of a passenger in a cab be doubtful and if the random stopping of cab absent such consent be forbid then the result reach here be questionable the case turn on the follow question do the participation of the cab company in a voluntary program which give the company 's consent to the police stop a company 's cab amount to a consent by the passenger of the cab to be stop seize and visually search when there be neither reasonable suspicion nor probable cause to believe there be any criminal activity but the cab driver do not can not have common authority over the passengerâ€ ™ s person simply and obviously a person can not give third- party consent to the search or seizure of another person for the purpose of third party consent in this seizure the relevant object over which the cab driver and passenger would need to have common authority be the taxicab passenger indeed the only authority 4 even if the cab company could consent to stop and seizure of its cab when the cab have only the driver in it it do not follow that the driver have any authority to consent to the seizure of the passenger -4- notoriously dangerous occupation and the safety of driver have be and continue to be at risk this case be an important one not just for the development of fourth amendment law but also for the quality of life in urban area and the protection of individual right by the court phoebe morse clerk i respectfully dissent from the denial of defendant woodrum 's petition for rehear en banc for two reason the case have great constitutional and societal significance and so meet the requirement of rule 35(a fed 14 2000 no 1994 newman c.j. concurring the tips program be not a plan embody explicit neutral limitation on the conduct of individual officer the analogy be weak we would not say that the owner of a hotel could consent to the search of hotel room occupy by guest through the owner 's voluntary participation in a program that authorize police to enter the room at their discretion to protect the cleaning staff or to prevent theft of hotel property.5 in stoner v. california 376 u.s. 483 1964 the supreme court hold that the fourth amendment protect a hotel guest from use of evidence seize under a consent to search his hotel room give by the desk clerk give the reality of urban life the panel 's decision affirm the validity of consent to seizure through the tips program may mean that the tips program will be emulate in other city and in other sector of the economy.2 but there be also interest on the other side particularly fourth amendment interest indeed the panel opinion acknowledge that third party consent have only be apply to search not seizure in delaware v. prouse 440 u.s. 648 1979 the supreme court hold that such stop be unconstitutional
130	130	198780.json	 on april 7 1999 after a hearing the district court enter an order refuse to dissolve the preliminary injunction uphold in patch iv and grant in substance the additional relief seek by connecticut valley to defer any flow back of the increase that the company have collect before this court vacate the district court 's april 1998 injunction in that respect in patch v. the district court do not discuss at length its reason for the first of these action but it write several paragraph of finding and explanation with respect to the second however in the same proceeding the district court have also order the commission to allow a specific rate increase seek by connecticut valley to recover increase power cost which the commission have previously disallow in december 1997 see patch v 167 f.3d at 32 33 in our companion decision patch v we vacate the district court 's injunction in this respect hold that connecticut valley have not show a likelihood of prevail in federal court on this aspect of the case the commission not only roll back the rate increase but also order further temporary reduction by connecticut valley below the level prevail in december 1997 in order to flow back to customer the amount of the increase that have be collect between the time of the district court 's injunction with respect to the disallowance and the later vacation of that injunction in patch v. connecticut valley then ask the district court to enjoin the commission from require this further reduction until the district court decide the merit of connecticut valley 's request for a permanent injunction require the commission to allow the company to charge rate sufficient to cover all of its cost base on its order respect the disallowance and the refund the district court seemingly believe that both measure be vulnerable to a federal injunction despite the johnson act and it may be on the verge of make clear why the large utility in the state public service company of new hampshire psnh obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court base inter alia on a colorable claim that the state 's action violate a specific agreement with that company and so also violate bankruptcy court order and the contract clause of the u.s. constitution if within that period it have decide the merit of the request for a permanent injunction in a way inconsistent with refund or have take any other action that provide a showing that the company be likely to prevail on the merit in federal court in bar the refund it may enter a supercede injunction against the refund order which the commission may then appeal to we our patch v decision vacate this aspect of the district court 's preliminary injunction thereby permit the commission to roll back connecticut valley 's retail rate to the pre-1998 level see 167 f.3d at 36 on january 18 1999 the commission move to vacate the injunction primarily on the ground that change in accounting treatment by the financial account standards board have eliminate the threat rely upon by psnh in its original showing of irreparable injury on this record we be no more able to sustain the injunction against the commission 's new refund order than we be to sustain the early injunction against the underlie disallowance that we vacate in patch v. but the district court may be on the verge of supply the miss explanation in decide the merit of the now submit cros motion for summary judgment the order of the commission refuse to allow connecticut valley to recover the cost increase impose by central vermont be not order implement that plan which be why in patch v we vacate the further relief grant by the district court otherwise no later than the end of the 90 day period the district court must vacate its present injunction insofar as it enjoin the commission 's refund order it be credibly allege at least sufficiently for preliminary relief that the restructuring plan as frame at the time would prevent psnh from ever recover very substantial prior investment assertedly protect by a specific contract with the state and by implement order of the bankruptcy court as we point out in patch iv 167 f.3d at 23 28 the commission make little effort to challenge the showing of irreparable injury by either psnh or connecticut valley without sharply distinguish between this specific disallowance by the commission and its far reach restructuring plan the district court in april 1998 direct the commission to allow the increase if the commission think that this adjustment change everything it certainly should have stress this in its original appeal in patch iv or ask for a remand to consider the effect of the change on this appeal little need be say about the district court 's refusal to modify the preliminary injunction enjoin the the commission 's restructuring plan during this same period two new and quite distinct dispute have arise one relate to the preliminary injunction uphold in patch iv and the other to the further interim relief that we disallow in patch v. the first of these two dispute stem from a new motion file by the commission after patch iv ask the district court to vacate its early injunction bar the new hampshire restructuring plan the district court 's refusal to modify the injunction insofar as it prohibit implementation of the restructuring plan be affirm insofar as the district court have enjoin the commission 's refund order the matter be remand for further proceeding consistent with this opinion the commission now appeal challenge both aspect of the district court 's order it be thus possible that in the near future the district court will grant permanent injunctive relief require the commission to allow cost pass throughs of central vermont cost increase and if so it would be very odd to have refund inconsistent with such an injunction make effective in the next several month in part the company 's defense of this new relief rest on a narrow ground namely on case law that the company argue allow a court to defer claim of restitution stem from a vacated preliminary injunction until the merit have be decide in any event the district court do not abuse its discretion in refuse to modify the preliminary injunction base on the accounting change if so there may be a remedy available to connecticut valley in state court and in any event if central vermont prevail at the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and be allow to impose a termination charge on connecticut valley the commission may be force to retreat from its effort to compel the contract termination thereby undermine its rationale for its disallowance order but as be show by even a brief review of the company 's motion paper it be certainly not the only one nor be the great dollar impact on the company attribute to this accounting requirement in its brief and at oral argument connecticut valley make clear that it think that the district court have assure the company pendente lite of its right to collect its cost a goal frustrate in part by this court 's suppose failure to understand that cost recovery be the status quo that the district court have seek to preserve once again the issue relate to interim matter the merit have not yet be decide in the district court the irreparable injury showing initially make by psnh rest in part on an accounting convention regard the financial treatment of so call regulatory asset accord to psnh 's affidavit the propose new hampshire restructuring plan would have trigger change in the company 's financial statement place it in immediate default on huge bank loan its own contract clause argument be quite different from that of psnh which implicate a specific bankruptcy settlement formally approve by the state and lack a connection to federal bankruptcy order connecticut valley 's contract clause claim may even if otherwise sound face some difficulty in federal court give the broad language of the johnson act while proceeding in the district court as to a permanent injunction for psnh have be defer pende approval of the settlement litigation between the commission and connecticut valley have move forward several month ago both side argue cros motion for summary judgment on the merit of permanent relief on remand the district court may defer vacation of this injunction against the refund order for up to 90 day nevertheless give the limitation impose by burford and the johnson act it remain unclear why connecticut valley think that it can overturn the disallowance order in federal court for this reason we have determine not to vacate the district court 's injunction against the refund order ourselves but instead to remand this aspect of the case to the district court for further proceeding consistent with this opinion however thus far in the district court neither psnh nor any other company have justify relief consistent with burford and the johnson act against any rate order of the commission except its attempt to implement the restructuring plan and as we explain in patch v 167 f.3d at 35 36 connecticut valley have not yet make such a showing of likely vulnerability as to the disallowance order in 1997 act under recently enact state legislation the new hampshire public utilities commission the commission issue a plan and implement order to restructure electric power regulation in the state the commission oppose the request unless the original commission order disallow the connecticut valley increase be vulnerable to injunction by a federal court it be hard to see what authority a federal court have to defer the commission order refund this often make sense because the final outcome may affect the amount of any restitution or damage relief or show that nothing at all should be repay even though the preliminary relief be wrongly grant in the first place the decision rely on by connecticut valley see note 2 above reflect a common sense policy that allow a district court to wait until the end of a case to undo any mischief work by interim relief it grant in error this be equally true of the commission 's late order lower rate temporarily below the december 1997 rate to refund the amount collect under the vacated patch v injunction ordinarily a district judge have a great deal of freedom to impose interim relief and in particular to preserve the status quo in all matter properly before it nor have the company yet be able to explain plausibly at least to we how the disallowance order conflict with a federal statute or ferc order claim admittedly likely to avoid the johnson act 's bar when in early 1998 connecticut valley join psnh in seek interim relief it provide argument and affidavit of its own to demonstrate the harm that the restructuring plan would do to it the commission take the view that while the increase in connecticut valley 's cost be real purchase from central vermont be no long prudent because power could currently be buy for less on the open market once again the project accounting treatment of regulatory asset be one of several strand in the showing of harm to connecticut valley at good the state agency may be exploit a possible drafting mistake the short notice termination clause in the original contract between the two utility to shift to central vermont or to vermont ratepayer what may well have be connecticut valley 's prudently incur cost of achieve long- term rate protection for its new hampshire customer the second dispute arise in the wake of our decision in patch v vacate a different aspect of the district court 's pendente lite relief yet the change in accounting treatment now trumpet by the commission be apparently make in july 1997 over a year before our decision in patch iv uphold the same injunction psnh barely thread its way through this maze of limitation in obtain a preliminary injunction against the restructuring plan relief extend to the other utility partly base on default by the commission our decision in patch iv affirm the preliminary injunction against the restructuring plan be render on december 3 1998

payment of any monie from international explorations ltd. iel in which pearson allegedly hold a 2 interest at that point gannon and the chapter 7 trustee withdraw as moot the motion to appoint gannon special counsel to prosecute all chapter 7 estate claim against first bank at 616 since attorney be officer of the court their conduct if dishonest would constitute fraud on the court although the motion to appoint gannon as special counsel to the chapter 7 trustee acknowledge that the wadleigh firm incorporate spring pond it fail to disclose that pearson have allege in state court complaint no it be clear from the record on appeal that the first second and fourth factor announce in acworth obtain in the present case c. the putative waiver of conflict of interest the bankruptcy court nevertheless rule that even assume a conflict of interest pearson either consent to representation by the wadleigh firm or acquiesce in perpetrate a fraud upon the court since pearson neither notify the bankruptcy court of the ground give rise to any conflict nor instruct attorney gannon to do so although the november 15 motion to withdraw the ex parte motion for gannon 's appointment represent that the chapter 7 trustee and first bank have agree to the compromise while note that the compromise be acceptable to the debtor the term acceptable be hardly unambiguous although gannon acknowledge that the wadleigh firm have incorporate spring pond he represent to the bankruptcy court that the recent settlement with the tamposis have eliminate[d any conflict of interest as between pearson and the tamposi defendants accordingly we now apply the colorable claim test rather than the smoking gun standard for determine whether the bankruptcy court abuse its discretion in reject the rule 9024 motion submit by pearson moreover even assume attorney gannon have no affirmative obligation to disclose the conflict of interest at the time the chapter 7 case commence such a duty plainly would have arise under the bankruptcy rules upon his appointment as special counsel to the chapter 7 estate

magnuson act the nmfs thus seize all of the scallop notify the noaa of the violation and fine northern wind $ 35,000 the first mention of the mix argument come and fail at the discretionary administrative appeal northern wind then file suit in the district of massachusetts seek judicial review of the issue it raise in the original administrative hearing but do not reassert the mix argument that the deputy deny both northern wind and the noaa file cros motion for summary judgment and after a hearing the district court remand the case to the alj to rule as a matter of law on whether 50 c.f.r. background northern wind the owner of a seafood processing plant in new bedford massachusetts enter into an agreement with ocean obsession ltd. ocean obsession a seafood supplier for the storage of atlantic sea scallop subsequently the noaa issue to northern wind a notice of violation and assessment charge it with the possession of nonconforme atlantic sea scallop in violation of 50 c.f.r. northern wind also raise a new argument on appeal assert that because the alj find that only the weymouth scallop be nonconforming and because the weymouth and canton scallop be mixed together in the cooler it follow that all of the random sample have be mix mean they have be through their first transaction in the united states and be not subject to the regulation at issue the record of the original administrative hearing indicate that northern wind only raise issue of where the scallop be harvest whether the scallop be shuck at sea or on land and whether northern wind have actual possession of they second northern wind contend that it do not possess the scallop within the meaning of those regulation northern wind request a hearing to challenge whether the nmfs seize the scallop after the first transaction in the united states contend that the scallop have be shuck on land prior to be store thus they be not be subject to the regulation because the shucking be the first transaction in the united states as we have note northern wind originally argue to the alj that by the time the noaa inspect the allegedly nonconforming scallop they already have be shuck on land make it impossible to determine if prior to shuck they conform to the regulation rather than arguing to the deputy that the scallop have be shuck on land northern wind claim that ocean obsession 's combined carriage of the canton and weymouth bag to its facility constitute a mix transaction that put the scallop outside of the regulation reach plaintiff northern wind inc. northern wind appeal the district court 's grant of summary judgment for defendant the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa first it contend that ocean obsession mix together the two shipment of scallop before the nmfs measure they and that this mix put they beyond the reach of the applicable regulation the decide alj read the term possession in the regulation not to require ownership of the scallop and conclude that northern wind possess the scallop because it allow they to be store at its processing facility here however the review be far limit because the magnuson act incorporate the familiar standard of review associate with the administrative procedure act apa on the basis of this evidence we can not say that the alj 's interpretation of the term possession be plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the noaa 's regulation the case return to the district court which grant summary judgment for the noaa conclusion for the reason state the district court properly enter summary judgment in favor of the noaa 1858 and a finding by an administrative law judge alj that northern wind be liable for the possession of nonconforme atlantic sea scallop under the magnuson stevens fishery conservation and management act magnuson act 16 u.s.c. nevertheless northern wind have access to the cooler at all time even if a representative of ocean obsession be not present the decide alj order the noaa to reimburse ocean obsession for the improperly seize canton bag and far find that northern wind do possess all of the offending scallop within the meaning of the statute finally northern wind contend that only know possession be proscribe by the regulation and it do not knowingly possess the scallop both the noaa and northern wind appeal the alj 's decision to the deputy undersecretary of the noaa the evidence also establish that northern wind could inspect the scallop at will could choose to take and purchase the scallop and have a just right to they because it could prevent ocean obsession from take any action on the scallop until it have exercise its right of first refusal the decide alj also make a specific finding in his decision base upon the record of the hearing that there be two separate shipment at the storage facility that alj find that while the nmfs seize scallop from both the canton bag and the weymouth bag only those from the weymouth bag evidence a violation because they be shuck at sea and have not be mixed sort or process after they land in the united states the noaa challenge its obligation to pay compensation for the canton scallop and northern wind allege various procedural error northern wind also challenge whether it actually possess the scallop within the meaning of the statute because northern wind fail to raise the mix argument in the appropriate administrative venue we find it administratively waive the deputy do not reach the merit of northern wind 's appeal the only other person with access to this separate portion of the cooler be the owner of northern wind 650.7(a 650.2 as northern wind concede in its brief the primary issue before the alj be whether the seize scallop originate from shell stock shuck at sea in which case they would be subject to regulation or on land in which case they would not on these occasion northern wind would view the stock store in the cooler on the next business day 904.273(d render issue of law or fact waive unless they be raise for the first time in the initial decision or could not reasonably have be foresee and raise by the party during the hearing however northern wind present a different theory in its petition for discretionary review of the alj 's decision in exchange ocean obsession give northern wind a right of first refusal on the scallop store in its cooler the previous night ocean obsession have offload and store 12,439 pound of scallop at northern wind 's facility northern wind concede that its mix argument do not fall within any exception to the waiver rule but maintain that the issue be not waive because it sufficiently be raise in the original alj hearing and reassert in the administrative appeal 100 noaa 1988 find a seafood processor in possession of nonconforme scallop because it allow undersized scallop to be offload at its facility and it assist in pack and ice the scallop for transport storage and resale in re axelsson amp johnson fish co. 5 o.r.w. northern wind advance no reason why it could not have raise the mix issue at the administrative hearing before the original alj who allow testimony regard the two separate shipment however the sample the nmfs take from both set of bag and measure at northern wind have an average weight of 75.8 meat per pound ocean obsession warrant that all of the scallop it store in the cooler would be in conformance with the magnuson act and othermaritime regulation the evidence at the hearing demonstrate that northern wind provide ocean obsession with storage space and unlimited access to that space for the storage of its offload scallop moreover the decide alj 's determination that northern wind possess the scallop and thatthe regulation have no scienter

141	141	198792.json	 first the district court instruct the jury on the two relate standard of criminal liability to be apply should it find that appellant directly participate in the use of a firearm to find the defendant under consideration guilty of count 4 you must find either that he knowingly use or aid and abet another in use a firearm or that he knowingly carry or aid and abet another in carry a firearm if you find that the government have prove the defendant under consideration guilty of conspiracy as charge in count 3 of the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt you may also find that defendant guilty of any substantive crime allege in count 4 through 10 and count 12 through 18 with which he be charge provide you find that the essential element of those count as define in these instruction have be establish beyond a reasonable doubt and provide far you also find that each of the follow four element have sic be prove beyond a reasonable doubt one that the specific substantive offense at issue of murder attempt murder or assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering or of use or carry a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence as describe in any of the count 4 through 10 and count 12 through 18 of the indictment be commit by a member of the conspiracy as detail in count 3 of the indictment two that the substantive crime be commit during the existence or life of and in furtherance of the goal or objective of the conspiracy three that the substantive crime be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy reasonably foreseeable to the defendant then under consideration and four that at the time that the substantive crime be commit the defendant under consideration be a member of the conspiracy first with respect to the form for mr. carrozza you will see that the first page as to count 4 use or carry firearm in count 3 but even though t]he mere possibility that the jury act irrationally without more will not negate the collateral estoppel effect of a prior verdict if a rational interpretation of the verdict as a whole be possible romeo 114 f.3d at 144 emphasis add citation omit appellant be confront with more that be the government 's plausible interpretation of the ambiguous jury instruction and the apparent irrationality of the jury verdict second the court give the pinkerton instruction see pinkerton v. united states 328 u.s. 640 1946 define a third and less direct standard of criminal liability which be applicable because count 3 be not a substantive offense but a conspiracy the defendant unlike the relatively straightforward jury instruction in the case cite by appellant see e.g. united states v. romeo 114 f.3d 141 9th cir thus they argue no rational jury could have acquit they on count 4 due to the government 's failure to prove factor two and three since the government 's evidence compel an inference that the use of the firearm be both foreseeable and in furtherance of the count 3 conspiracy as actually execute far appellant not the government must bear the burden of persuasion see morris 99 f.3d at 480 by explain in a convincing manner why the jury if it do agree when it acquit on count 4 that the count 3 conspiracy do not exist do not then acquit on count 3 the applicability of the collateral estoppel doctrine be review de novo see united states v. lanoue 137 f.3d 656 661 1st cir motion in limine ciampi claim that the acquittal on count 13 use of handgun equip with silencer under count 12 in attempt murder of cirame and count 17 use of machine gun under count 16 in attempt murder of stephen rossetti bar the government from introduce evidence of ciampi 's use of those particular firearm at any retrial on count 4 which charge he with use firearm to far a conspiracy to murder fourteen person include cirame and rossetti its instruction state if the jury be to find that the government ha[d prove the defendant under consideration guilty of conspiracy as charge in count 3 of the indictment it could then convict the defendant under consideration of count 4 even if that defendant do not directly use the gun or aid and abet another person in its use provide the jury also determine that the government have prove four factor beyond a reasonable doubt 1 some member of the count 3 conspiracy other than the defendant under consideration use or carry the firearm 2 defendant 's coconspirator use the gun during the existence or life of and in furtherance of the goal or objective of the conspiracy 3 the coconspirator 's use of that firearm be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy to the defendant and 4 the coconspirator 's use of the firearm occur at the time that accordingly appellant contend the jury must have acquit on count 4 because it find that either 1 the count 3 conspiracy do not exist or 2 appellant be not member of that conspiracy although appellant need not meet a standard of absolute certainty and our approach must be pragmatic in order to prevent the rejection of a collateral estoppel defense in every case in which the prior judgment be base on a general verdict of acquittal united states v. morris 99 f.3d 476 481 1st cir the government offer a plausible explanation since the instruction that the jury not consider count 4 prior to count 3 be give immediately after the pinkerton instruction the jury may have understand mistakenly that the prohibition against consider count 4 before count 3 apply only to its consideration of the pinkerton criminal liability theory not its consideration of the early direct liability or aid and abet theory ciampi submit a separate motion in limine to bar at any retrial on count 4 all evidence of his use of a firearm equip with a silencer or of a machine gun as describe in count 13 and 17 respectively on the ground that his acquittal on these count must have be base on an implicit jury find that he neither use nor carry these particular weapon normally a double jeopardy appeal be encompass within the cohen exception to the final judgment rule precisely because absent an immediate appeal the core relief confer by the double jeopardy clause be irretrievably lose to the would be appellant that be insulation from the burden of an improper retrial in swint v. chambers county commission 514 u.s. 35 1995 the supreme court place severe constraint on the exercise of this type of pendant jurisdiction devincent morris and aguilar aranceta each involve the former variety shortly thereafter we reject the appeal from the district court order deny the motion to dismiss then dismiss the appeal from the denial of ciampi 's motion in limine for lack of appellate jurisdiction permit the retrial to proceed 99 1684 united states of america appellee v. anthony ciampi defendant appellant under certain condition therefore a defendant may be find guilty of the other crime even though he or she do not participate directly in the act constitute the offense since the jury find the defendant neither guilty nor not guilty on count 3 but deadlocke instead we be leave to divine an interpretation of the charge which might explain its rationale moreover since appellant do not object to the instruction below the latent ambiguity may not be challenge on appeal when a jury reach a general verdict of acquittal on certain count therefore the defendant may argue that the jury must have base its acquittal on certain factual finding favorable to he and that those finding bar any retrial on other count upon which he be not acquit since his conviction in the retrial necessarily would depend on the jury at retrial reach contrary finding as to the same essential fact appellant argue that the jury could have acquit on count 4 only if it find that the government fail to prove all three standard of criminal liability actual use aid and abetting and pinkerton coconspirator liability the jury acquit ciampi on count 13 16 and 17 but deadlocke on count 12 in other word the jury may have acquit simply because it find that a codefendant i.e. not the defendant under consideration have use or carry the firearm or because the defendant under consideration have not know to a practical certainty that a codefendant be use a gun the jury acquit marino and carrozza on count 4 but be unable to reach verdict as to appellant on count 1 2 and 3 or ciampi on count 4 1998 the more tenebrous those instruction the more difficult it may be for defendant to demonstrate unequivocally on appeal that the jury necessarily predicate its verdict on a particular finding in devincent we simply point out that collateral estoppel be separate from the application of the blockburger rule or from the core concept of double jeopardy as well as the comparison of the statutory element of the two crime in that c]ollateral estoppel need not apply to a whole count but instead can control a single element of a count or trial therefore appellant reason in consider the pinkerton standard the jury must have find that at least one of four factor have not be prove 1 the existence of the count 3 conspiracy 2 defendant 's coconspirator 's use of the firearm in furtherance of that conspiracy 3 defendant 's ability reasonably to foresee his coconspirator 's firearm use or 4 defendant 's membership in the conspiracy at the time the firearm be use appellants carrozza and marino later move to dismiss count 3 and ciampi and marino move to dismiss count 30 on the ground that their retrial on these count be bar by the double jeopardy clause because their acquittal on count 4 and 31 be base on an implicit jury find that the conspiracy charge in count 3 and 30 do not exist or if they do exist appellant be not member in contrast even if the ciampi motion in limine have be grant by the district court a retrial on count 4 still would have be necessary unlike appellant joint collateral estoppel claim see supra section ii.a not even a successful appeal from the denial of ciampi 's motion in limine would preclude his retrial on count 4 finally ciampi suggest that since there can be no question that we possess jurisdiction of the joint appeal from the denial of appellant motion to dismiss see supra section ii.a the interest of judicial efficiency would be serve be we to invoke our pendant jurisdiction over ciampi 's interlocutory appeal from the denial of his motion in limine however the authority rely on by ciampi principally united states v. devincent 632 f.2d 155 1st cir 846 see also count 1 racketeering act b and count 31 charge ciampi and marino with use or carry a firearm in connection with the count 30 conspiracy to distribute narcotic see 18 u.s.c. 99 1955 united states of america appellee v. robert f. carrozza a k a bobby russo defendant appellant 99 1618 united states of america appellee v. vincent m. marino a k a gigi portalla defendant appellant accordingly since each collateral estoppel claim be to be evaluate on its own peculiar fact the idiosyncratic record in the present case lead we to conclude that the district court correctly deny the motion to dismiss

when a crime of fraud involve the violation of any judicial or administrative order injunction decree or process not address elsewhere in the guideline in the court 's view rowe 's testimonial denial of an ownership interest in real property locate at 20 highland avenue nahant massachusetts be untruthful and material and thereby warrant a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice the district court also increase rowe 's base offense level by two on the ground that by conceal his interest in the residence rowe violate a judicial order or process require he to disclose all of his

district court rowe 's attorney renew his allegation of perjury and argue that the government 's pursuit of an ethical complaint against he be retaliatory instead it estimate rowe 's interest in the

the time rowe file his petition edi a company that he and his brother have create be pay upwards of $ 1800 per month in rent for rowe to live in a house he personally have lease the focus upon

melndez garca bez jurado and lpez morales be affirm although we must vacate their sentence on count two of the indictment and remand to the district court for resentencing as discuss above the government present substantial evidence of guilt primarily through the testimony of aponte laz but also at least in the case of melndez garca and bez jurado through the appellant own inculpatory statement to investigator furthermore the district court take pain to instruct the jury that they be to judge aponte laz 's credibility on the basis of his testimony alone and not that of agent huff near the guayanez river the car become stuck in a sugar cane bank and aponte laz bez jurado lpez morales and edna exit the car the evidence of rosario daz 's drug trafficking be clearly relevant in that it connect rosario daz to edna support the government 's theory on motive and corroborate the critical testimony of aponte laz at trial the united states offer a great deal of testimony detail the drug trafficking activity of defendant rosario daz and to a less extent montalvo ortiz the five of they aponte laz melndez garca her son victor bez- jurado and lpez morales then walk the street near the plaza after receive brief conduct a hearing and review the statement of edna 's father the trial court deny the motion for a new trial on august 6 1998 aponte laz bez jurado and lpez morales consume the drug in the car as they drive indeed the great resource available to the federal government at the investigatory and prosecutorial stage often counsel in favor of such an approach it be true that give the circumstance surround the crime commit aponte laz 's participation therein and his obvious motive to testify favorably for the government aponte laz 's credibility be subject to challenge at trial the prosecution 's star witness be aponte laz who testify extensively about the detail of the crime and the participation of each defendant to facilitate the crime rosario daz provide aponte laz with several piece of information include edna 's address the color and make of her car as well as some of the number of the car 's license plate first we find the evidence of the plot to be plainly relevant to lpez morales 's guilt in the carjacking insofar as it evince a consciousness of guilt because aponte- laz 's testimony be not facially unbelievable we hold that his testimony alone provide the jury with enough evidence to support the conviction of melndez garca bez jurado and lpez morales while melndez garca sit in the car with edna 's baby the rest of the group go to a secluded area surround by bamboo tree and edna be order to sit on a towel although we be not explicit a fair reading of spinney support the proposition that the level of knowledge require to support an aiding and abet conviction be relate to the specificity of the principal offense as to both mens rea and actus reus ralph rosario daz wilson montalvo ortiz ada melndez garca juan bez jurado

of a carjacking in violation of 18 u.s.c. the united states argue that rosario daz and montalvo- ortiz should have know that aponte laz and his cohort might choose a carjacking as a way to execute their contract on edna because rosario daz in the presence of montalvo ortiz give aponte laz the make and model of edna 's car as well as some of the number from her license plate indeed in a case such as this one where the bulk of critical testimony come from a single cooperate coconspirator the prosecution 's principal task be often to convince the jury that the witness 's account be credible at that point rosario daz montalvo- ortiz and aponte laz discuss the plan participation of defendant juan bez jurado likewise in this case the united states offer evidence of the plan to kill government witness for a number of legitimate reason aim ultimately at prove the charge offense include to prove consciousness of guilt and to explain the inconsistency between aponte laz 's initial exoneration of lpez morales and his subsequent change in testimony when aponte laz and melndez garca exit the hospital however bez jurado have leave the group aponte laz melndez garca and vctor approach the car at the same time as edna compliment and inquire about her baby the conspiracy and the carjacking on june 9 1995 defendant ralph rosario daz and wilson montalvo ortiz place a telephone call to gregorio aponte laz who would later be a codefendant in this case and ultimately the government 's star cooperate witness 1985 the admission of evidence of an offense not charge in the indictment can in some circumstance constitute ground for reversal of a conviction lpez morales now argue that this evidence be irrelevant unfairly prejudicial and that its admission implicitly amend the indictment in violation of the grand jury clause of the fifth amendment the government also argue that at the very least rosario daz and montalvo ortiz have knowledge that a carjacking be likely when they direct aponte- laz to the doctor 's office and aponte laz opine that such circumstance would facilitate the crime because it would avoid the need to go to edna 's house after state that the district court 's severance determination should be overturn only upon a showing of strong prejudice see i d. we nevertheless conclude that the trial court 's careful instruction to the jury and the ample evidence against the defendant eliminate any possibility of unfair prejudice if the court permit the jury to convict a defendant on evidence of a crime not include in the indictment that constitutional right be violate because there be insufficient evidence in the record for the jury to reasonably find that rosario daz and montalvo ortiz have the requisite foreknowledge that a carjacking would be commit we must reverse their conviction on count one of the indictment when the police arrive the knife and a photo of aponte laz be find in edna 's car the investigation and trial on june 15 1995 after be apprehend by edna 's husband aponte laz give the first of several inconsistent statement to law enforcement there can be no reasonable dispute that the rape evidence be inseparably intertwine with the carjacking and murder and the evidence present to the jury be necessary to complete the story of the crime charge in the indictment even though that indictment charge appellant with a carjacking that result in death rather than the less crime of a carjacking result in bodily injury in spinney for example we hold that a conviction for aiding and abet an armed bank robbery must be support by evidence that the defendant be on notice of the likelihood that the principal would use a dangerous weapon in the commission of the bank robbery again the agent 's allege

the district court 's omission of the subsection 3 element from the jury instruction an error this phase of the inquiry be substantially equivalent to the analysis for harmless error under rule 52(a with the important distinction that no objection having be make in the trial court it be the defendant burden to convince we that the error complain of be prejudicial the overwhelming evidence that the carjack result in death couple with the verdict that be render not only serve to allay any worry that the defendant substantial right be prejudice but also adequately forestall a conclusion that the omission of an instruction on the subsection 3 element could have seriously affect the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceeding the testimony be not inherently unbelievable and in the absence of a reason not to do so we defer to the district court 's first hand evaluation of batalla 's credibility as a witness finally the defendant argue that the trial court should not have allow several auto part which be eventually rule inadmissible for lack of foundation to be display in the courtroom where the jury could see they and to be the subject of some de bene expert testimony and a person may be convict of that crime only if the jury have find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the element set forth in subsection 3 that death result from the carjacking the district court apparently consider that the element of the offense be set forth in the first unnumbered paragraph of the statute and instruct the jury accordingly without any objection from the defendant santiago challenge the latter part of the court 's finding argue that no valid consent be give and even if it be the officer seize evidence which exceed the scope of the consent here the indictment specifically refer to 2119(3 and adequately set forth the element necessary to convict prez and santiago of the offense define by that subsection but the court omit to instruct the jury that they could convict of that offense only if they find beyond a reasonable doubt that vzquez 's death result from the carjacking while this appeal be pende the supreme court hold that subsection 1 2 and 3 of 2119 define three separate offense by the specification of distinct element each of which must be charge by indictment prove beyond a reasonable doubt and submit to a jury for its verdict although the form santiago sign state that the police could take a part singular not part plural batalla testify that santiago orally agree to the seizure of all the part and even go so far as to help the officer load the part into a police car one of the officer ulysses batalla ramos batalla later testify that having obtain santiago 's consent the police search in and around the automobile and a shed locate nearby on santiago 's property on the totality of circumstance describe in the evidence the district court could reasonably have conclude that santiago voluntarily consent to the seizure of all the part take it be speculative to surmise as the district court apparently do that serrano may simply have overlook the part of the statement of fact in his plea bargain that deal with compensation the district court refuse to allow the plea statement to be use primarily for two reason first because the issue of serrano 's compensation have nothing to do with the essential element of the offense to which serrano plead guilty and thus serrano might have pay inadequate attention to that part of the statement when he adopt it and second because serrano have already admit in cross examination that he might have expect to be compensate thus expose the very inconsistency that the defense seek to illuminate batalla testify that santiago be not threaten intimidate or coerced but rather that he invite the officer onto the property permit they to look around and agree to let they take away the white station wagon and the auto part for these reason there be no error in the denial of the motion to suppress the fruit of the search of santiago 's property consider the evidence that be before the jury and the jury 's resolution of other issue present to they we have no difficulty conclude that the trial court 's failure to instruct about the distinct element define by subsection 3 have no prejudicial effect on the defendant therefore we move to the third and fourth part of the plain error inquiry indeed the indictment which be read to the jury specifically allege that the force and violence consist of shoot he one time cause his death in convict the defendant in accordance with the instruction they receive the jury by necessity would have find the fact establish the linkage between the defendant the carjacking and the bullet in vzquez 's back it be the prosecution 's burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that consent be freely and voluntarily give there must be more than mere acquiescence in the face of an unfounded claim of present lawful authority the amendment thus alter the element of the offense eliminate as an element the possession of a firearm and add an element of specific intent evidentiary rulings prez and santiago challenge a variety of evidentiary ruling make by the district court during the course of the trial argue that each of the challenge ruling be error in itself and that the cumulative effect of the error be to deny they a fair trial for the follow reason we affirm the conviction under count one of the indictment the jury convict the defendant of take a motor vehicle from vzquez by force and violence with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury in his testimony serrano say that pursuant to an agreement with the other man he drive prez and santiago to the construction site where vzquez be work leave they there to rob vzquez of his toyota and then proceed to another part of caguas to await their return the purpose of impeachment be to raise question about the veracity of the witness 's testimony often by point out that the witness have give inconsistent version of the same set of fact the government seek to introduce many of the auto part seize from santiago 's residence but the district court refuse to admit several of those part in evidence because the government could not establish the necessary foundation the government suggest that the offense define in 2119(3 be adequately charge since the jury be instruct on the element of inten[t to cause death or serious bodily harm contain in the initial unnumbered paragraph on the carjack conviction both defendant be sentence to life imprisonment pursuant to subsection 3 of 18 u.s.c. the district court find that the discovery of the white toyota station wagon occur because it be in plain view and that the subsequent seizure of auto part from santiago 's property have be make with his total absolute and complete consent it be therefore not the sort of pretense to present lawful authority that bumper forbid as a foundation for consent under count two the jury convict the defendant of use or carry a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence after the defendant be convict the court sentence they each to life imprisonment in accordance with subsection 3 the defense proffer but be not allow to show that serrano have adopt the factual statement in his plea bargain in every respect after brief deliberation the jury find prez and santiago guilty of both carjack and the use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence jorge l. arroyo alejandro by appointment of the court for appellant david prez montaez and rachel brill by appointment of the court for appellant jos ral santiago be on consolidated brief state less formally the jury find that when the defendant steal vzquez 's car from he they be arm with a gun and they harbor the specific intent to cause death or serious bodily injury what jones hold and what be of importance here be that subsection 1 2 and 3 do not simply set forth sentence option for the judge but rather define separate offense nor do the district court err in conclude that santiago give voluntary consent to the seizure of all the auto part take by the officer if those condition be meet an appellate court may exercise its discretion to correct the error provide that a fourth criterion be also meet the error must have seriously affect[ed the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceeding the defendant urge now that the failure of the district court to instruct on the distinct offense element set forth in subsection 3 require that their conviction of that offense be set aside it be not an abuse of discretion for the court to conclude that the factual recitation in the plea agreement would add little to what be already before the jury the evidence be admit not to prove the truth of the threat or their origin but to show serrano 's motivation for having change his version of event which he do several time before trial

plaintiff oversee medina and sierra and be select for this position rather than the plaintiff see also fernande 1999 wl 1252868 at 5 note that a plaintiff may elect to proceed simultaneously on both front and that the trial court at an appropriate stage of the litigation will channel the case into one format or the other on september 22 1995 ovitt with the consent of berg and curtis sampson the chief executive officer and president of the board of directors inform domnguez cruz that his employment be be terminate first the evidence put forth by the plaintiff in make his prima facie case clearly establish that dean ovitt who be the plaintiff 's direct supervisor and twelve year young than he and jeffrey berg who be two year young than the plaintiff make the decision to terminate the plaintiff with sampson 's approval the record reflect that ovitt the plaintiff 's direct supervisor and the key decisionmaker regard his termination refer to the plaintiff more than once as an old fart in front of other employee include medina and sierra third while suttle caribe maintain that the plan have always be to eliminate the plant manager position in both puerto rico and costa rica the position in costa rica have not as of the time of the deposition be eliminate in this age discrimination suit bring by a plant manager whose employment be terminate when he be 55 year old the district court enter summary judgment for the defendant suttle caribe on the recommendation of the magistrate judge in many case the line between mcdonnell douglas on the one hand and price waterhouse on the other hand be blur when a plaintiff present direct evidence of age discrimination the defendant must then either deny the validity or the sufficiency of the plaintiff 's evidence and have the jury instead the focus should be on the ultimate issue whether view the aggregate package of proof offer by the plaintiff and take all inference in the plaintiff 's favor the plaintiff have raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the termination of the plaintiff 's employment be motivate by age discrimination third and far support a possible inference that suttle caribe 's explanation be pretextual there be evidence suggest that restructuring be not the reason for the termination of the plaintiff 's employment where as here the plaintiff have raise a prima facie case and the defendant have meet the burden of production the mcdonnell douglas burdine hicks framework become less relevant in this case we take this course examine the totality of the evidence with the guidance of the mcdonnell douglas burdine- hicks framework and reserve judgment on the direct evidence issue perhaps the discussion memorialize in these note be about how to comply with the law but if so the cover up language be an odd choice in addition there be the note make by wielke the personnel manager at the summary judgment stage view the evidence as a whole and give that the court should not engage in credibility assessment see brennan v. gte gov't sys the record show that the employer have at different time articulate to varied audience different reason for end the plaintiff 's employment in fact the evidence show that domnguez cruz be the old suttle caribe employee in 1994 upper management at suttle caribe 's parent company suttle apparatus begin a restructure initiative design to reduce cost and standardize operation by put the right people in the right place if the defendant meet this burden the presumption of discrimination create by the prima facie case drop away and the burden of production shift back to the plaintiff to show that the employer 's state nondiscriminatory reason be a pretext for discrimination first there be evidence that in 1994 or early ovitt have offer the plant manager position to medina second the plaintiff have no prior notice that the company be consider eliminate the plant manager position even though he be integrally involve in the restructure effort at suttle caribe domnguez cruz direct this initiative at suttle caribe and as a result be responsible for terminate the employment of a number of employee in 1994 later he indicate that the plaintiff be fire because of his refusal to take the direction that the company be go and his insubordination 1998 the plaintiff bear the burden of prove that his year be the determinative factor in his discharge that is that he would not have be fire but for his age second the plaintiff say that even under the mcdonnell douglas burdine hicks framework summary judgment be improper because he produce evidence from which a jury could infer that the employer 's articulate reason be pretextual and that age discrimination be the real reason for his termination both judge find that the plaintiff alberto domnguez cruz make out a prima facie case of age discrimination under the familiar mcdonnell douglas burdine hicks framework 1999 or prove that it would have make the same decision even if it have not take the protect characteristic into account see ayala gerena v. bristol myers squibb co. 95 f.3d 86 95 96 1st cir the district court reject this argument find that the circumstantial evidence present by the plaintiff be insufficient to carry the burden of establish that age relate animus motivate his dismissal in addition to the potentially inconsistent reason the company give for the termination note of a conversation between a member of the personnel department and the key decisionmaker in the plaintiff 's termination include unusually and unfortunately for the company the phrase age descrim the district court agree conclude that although domnguez cruz have put forth a prima facie case of age discrimination he have fail to rebut suttle caribe 's non discriminatory reason for the dismissal medina in turn be hear by another employee refer to domnguez cruz as el viejo the old one or the old man in the course of say that he have be offer domnguez cruz 's job second and in addition to the evidence support domnguez cruz 's prima facie case the defendant present explanation for domnguez cruz 's termination that could be view as inconsistent that same day a memorandum from ovitt be distribute to all employee inform they that some organizational change would be make as a part of the restructuring of the organization 1998 but see ayala gerena 95 f.3d at 95 96 refer to the defendant 's obligation to affirmatively prove that it would have make the same decision in the summary judgment context at time suttle caribe have say that the termination be not an issue of performance but be instead the result of a business restructuring plan that involve the elimination of the plant manager position the plaintiff do not have to prove by a preponderance of the additional evidence that discrimination be in fact the motive for the action take although the company now claim that the long term plan have always be to eliminate the plant manager position the plaintiff testify that he be not aware that the restructuring initiative might result in the loss of his job at this final stage of the mcdonnell douglas burdine hicks framework this burden merge with the ultimate burden of persuade the court that the plaintiff have be the victim of intentional discrimination these note as well as the remark make by the key decisionmaker and another employee could lead a reasonable jury to infer that age discrimination be at work however the summary judgment record give little context to the remark and comment

from the time of westover 's arrest after the questioning by boocock the ins issue westover a show cause order charge she with deportability under then 8 u.s.c. in this case the ins consider westover to be without a valid visa instead the ins instruct westover that she could leave the country and apply for a new six month visa the ins do not instruct westover that if she intend to stay permanently in the united states she should apply for a new visa the chairman of the bia dissent find that this practice violate due process as the recitation of the fact early in this opinion show the evidence in this case be sufficient for the bia to uphold the finding of the ij first she claim that she be not inform of the reason for her arrest or of her removal hearing right as require by 8 c.f.r. however as the halabi dissent note see i d. the bia uphold the ij 's finding regard the original charge that westover be excludable at entry and be present without a valid visa and we affirm its order of removal on these ground without decide the overstay issue westover attack both the finding that she be removable and the denial of her application for adjustment of status it appear that westover

petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeal before torruella chief judge boudin and lynch circuit judges certain action by the ins in this case raise concern but in the end those action be not relevant to the legitimate basis for the removal order which we affirm we do not condone the agent conduct which appear from the record to be in direct violation of the statute on march 5 1992 westover acquire a six month non immigrant visitor visa from united states customs inspector jay labier at the port of entry in west berkshire vermont since the ij deny westover 's application for adjustment of status as a matter of discretion there be no need to adjudicate the form i-601 nothing in the record suggest that the ins know at the time it give she this advice that

right wrongful arrest and an invasion of privacy in this instance the judge give three reason for the fee award 1 that the federal claim of conspiracy be bring without any basis to support it although the rest to be sure there be proof that after the arrest the attendant converse with the officer and cooperate in the taking of crawford 's money and in arrange for towing of crawford 's automobile although different witness offer different version of the relevant event all the testimony point to a sudden unilateral decision by the officer to effect the arrest 202 2.06(2 and that therefore regardless of whether he rely on those sign the court should have find a per se violation of chapter 93a. in addition the court grant equitable relief in the form of an order expunge the record of the arrest include fingerprint and a photograph take at the time of booking in violation of a state law second the court decline to submit to the jury a claim for punitive damage arise from the unlawful arrest crawford allege inter alia that the police officer have deprive he of his liberty and property without probable cause in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments that the private defendant have conspire with the officer to effect the deprivation that both set of defendant have violate state civil right and tort law and that the private defendant have engage in deceptive

if the defendant can establish that the suit be totally unfounded frivolous or otherwise unreasonable when bring or that the plaintiff continue the litigation after it clearly become so but this evidence without more be insufficient to permit a jury reasonably to infer that the private defendant thereby knowingly collogue with the officer to deprive the plaintiff of his civil right to make appearance bad the towing be accomplish by a municipal contractor and the company 's owner who also own the service station be familiar with various police official give that crawford do not testify to any emotional distress traceable separately to the booking process but rather describe only an undifferentiated emotional upset follow the entire incident the decision be proper there be insufficient proof at trial however to sustain a reasonable inference that a mutual understanding arise between the station attendant and the police officer prior to crawford 's arrest in all instance we have take the evidence in the light most favorable to crawford as to the instruction it suffice to say that they sufficiently convey the relevant substance of most of the matter that crawford have want explain in great detail to the jury 1985 gibson j. dissent in part and we think it be unreasonable to hold the plaintiff to a high standard as to the section 1983 claim against the private defendant crawford allege several conspiracy theory first the court decide not to submit to the jury a separate claim for compensatory damage for mental distress stem from the invasion of privacy that allegedly occur during the booking process after both side have rest the district court grant in part the defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law we have instruct trial judge who make or decline to make fee award to explain their action so that at a bare minimum the order award fee read against the backdrop of the record as a whole expose[s the district court 's think process and show[s the method and manner underlie its decisional calculus even more troubling however be that the court 's basic precondition for the award the finding that the federal conspiracy claim be baseless when bring do not withstand scrutiny to the precise contrary in award fee to a prevail defendant a court must resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by conclude that because a plaintiff do not ultimately prevail his action must have be unreasonable or without foundation the jury award damage in the amount of $ 4,116 upon de novo review we affirm the judgment as a matter of law this be the sort of circumstantial sequence that have trouble even season jurist see e.g. ,alexis v. mcdonald 's restaurant of massachusetts inc. 67 f.3d 341 354 1st cir 1995 bownes

record that serve to contradict its assertion of good faith in accept and act upon the facially valid police authorization judge young add the result be that mr. crawford get no monetary benefit he

for which he make a claim for emergency assistance be his primary residence at the time of the hurricane during the trial juanita carrin vasquez carrin the government 's chief witness testify that she rent the house in question from rodrguez and that the house be not rodrguez 's principal residence our review of the record however convince we that the prosecutor 's statement do not affect the outcome of the trial furthermore the prosecutor 's statement be make between the judge 's presentation of two version of the stipulation both of which state that rodrguez have tell guzman that he have lie to she the determination of whether prosecutorial misconduct have so poison the well that a new trial be require united states v. manning 23 f.3d 570 574 1st cir p. 29(c or in the alternative for a new trial fed in the sidebar that follow the prosecutor explain that she disagree with the inclusion of about the $ 300 rent in the stipulation out of the presence of the jury the prosecutor say that guzman would testify that rodrguez have admit lie to she but have not offer any reason for tell the lie here the prosecutor make the statement immediately after the judge present to the jury the stipulation that rodrguez have call sylvia guzman to admit that he have lie to she in an early conversation although it be conceivable that the jury might have understand the prosecutor 's remark to refer to the lie charge in the first count that be not a likely interpretation the party have agree that when the defendant mr. rodriguez call back sylvia guzman of the housing department and say he have lie in the early interview he do not give any reason to she why he lie after the defense have rest the government inform the court that it intend to call guzman as a rebuttal witness rodrguez say that after the hurricane in an effort to help carrin get housing assistance he have lie to sylvia guzman a representative of the housing department by tell she that carrin have be pay he $ 300 rent each month give the circumstance in which the statement be make we affirm the district court 's decision although the judge give no curative instruction per se he express his agreement with defense counsel 's objection at the time the prosecutor make the challenge remark and later instruct the jury that statement by counsel be not to be consider as evidence as the government point out in its brief the context here be one in which the defendant himself repeatedly say in front of the jury that he have lie first we note that in this context the exact meaning of the statement he also lie be far from self evident second while the evidence against rodrguez be not overwhelming cf the stipulation be as follow when the defendant call back sylvia guzman of the housing department he inform she he have lie about the $ 300 rent c. curative instructions and strength of the evidence against the defendant in light of the limited severity of the misconduct and the context in which it occur the last two factor can be deal with briefly jan. 14 2000 as a one time misstatement at the end of a four day trial the prosecution 's comment be neither so egregious nor so pervasive as to poison the well first while in some circumstance the lack of a curative instruction may weigh in favor of a new trial see e.g. manning 23 f.3d at 575 we do not believe it do here auch 187 f.3d at 130 it be not so slight that the single remark be challenge could have tip the balance under these circumstance the most plausible conclusion be that the prosecutor 's remark he also lie refer to some aspect of rodrguez 's conversation with guzman p. 33 which the district court deny 1994 internal quotation mark and citation omit involve the weighing of several factor 1 the severity of the misconduct 2 the context in which it occur 3 whether the judge give any curative instruction and the likely effect of such instruction and 4 the strength of the evidence against the defendant i d. approach the bench rodrguez argue that the prosecutor 's statement that he rodrguez also lie be sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial and that the district court abuse its discretion in deny his motion when review a claim of prosecutorial misconduct we take a balanced view of the evidence in the record the indictment allege that the house for which rodrguez have receive fema assistance have not actually be his principal place of residence at the time of the hurricane the court exactly the first count be for make a false statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency 18 u.s.c. if the house that be destroy have not be rodrguez 's principal place of residence he would not have qualify for the grant he receive from fema at good he would have only qualified to receive a loan on august 6 1998 a jury convict rodrguez on the first count and acquit he on the second in his testimony rodrguez state that he have never agree to rent the house to carrin but that he have be let she and her child stay there for free as a favor second this be not a case in which the prosecutor 's allege misconduct be pervasive see manning 23 f.3d at 575 or repeat see auch 187 f.3d at 129 rubn rodrguez de jess rodrguez appeal the denial of his motion for a new trial which allege prosecutorial misconduct on april 22 1998 rodrguez be indict on two count of fraud against the united states the

effect of the beating on the victim go far beyond that which be relevant to the role issue first notwithstanding any suspicion that the xing da be smuggle alien into the united states the coast guard

profit â€ť it need to establish not only the price pay by the alien for the 54 day voyage but also the trip 's minimal cost to the coconspirator the district court could properly have infer from their participation in the negotiation with rendon and his associate that li and kwan know full well what the other member of the conspiracy be plan and could well have foresee that some level of inhumane treatment dangerous condition or bodily injury would attend the trip 1988 hold that the appellant be not in custody during an initial boarding despite the existence of probable cause to arrest because the appellant be not tell he be under arrest and because the coast guard merely engage in a routine boarding and inspection procedure in gather the crew to one area of the ship they say that there be no evidence that any of they be to be pay from the profit of the smuggling operation and that in fact their only form of compensation be free passage to the united states additionally we note that hui lin be not affect by the district court 's decision to apply the role in the offense enhancement shore by appointment of the court for appellant hui lin as for the evidence of shipboard condition evidence of the substantial price pay for passage to the united states go a long way towards prove profit but it do not conclusively prove the issue without some showing of the cost of the voyage subsection 2l1.1(b)(2)(c the applicable subsection here prescribe a six level increase if the offense involve the smuggling transporting or harboring of 100 or more unlawful alien and make no mention of profit thus at the time ben lin engage in the putatively communicative behavior at issue the boarding and inspection have not yet rise to the level of a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associate with formal arrest at one of the meeting li tell the agent that the alien would be keep together in the united states until appellant pay the balance due they for their offload service however they cite no authority for the proposition that co- conspirator who be not co defendant be to be exclude from the calculation.6 instead appellant argue that the status of

position be at odd with the position hui lin 's counsel take at sentencing where he argue first that it be foreseeable that much of this conduct could happen aboard the vessel and second that hui lin and yiu ming kwan do not know that the crew member be go to go crazy and do the kind of stuff they do but that they should have foresee it the government concede that it offer no specific evidence that mu li or ben lin have an expectation of be pay by the conspiracy but note that it be appellant burden to establish that the downward adjustment be warrant -26- the district court find by a preponderance of the evidence that each of the three defendant be motivate by 1 expectation of monetary gain and 2 hope of enter and remain inside the united states because each appellant challenge factual finding regard his participation in knowledge of or ability to have foresee the inhumane treatment and condition aboard the xing da it be this latter standard that apply here at least for ju lin nai fook li and yiu ming kwan who have preserve this issue for appeal as to the offload vessel kwan inspect it himself so he know that approximately 100 alien would be ferry into the united states in the hold of a tiny fishing boat with inadequate facility hui lin 's guideline range after the role in the offense enhancement be apply be only 27 33 month and have to be raise to the statutory minimum of 36 month the government agree with appellant that if the evidence demonstrate only that the defendant work on the ship in exchange for free passage they would have be entitle to the three- level decrease it stress that the entire enterprise be profit drive and that the coconspirator be therefore likely to limit the provision and amenity provide to the passenger mu li and ben lin argue that the district court engage in pure speculation when it find that they have an expectation of be pay out of the conspiracy 's profit moreover although the crew member be gather in one section of the ship during the inspection it appear that the coast guard have neither apply nor threaten any force â§ 5k2.8 which authorize a departure when the defendant 's conduct be unusually heinous cruel brutal or degrade to the victim the fact even if true that he be not on the ship do not communicate with the ship and do not order the action or condition aboard the ship do not require the conclusion

torres invite the district court to consider dr. nathanson 's report in its ruling on the merit of the rule 12(c motion and thus invite the court to convert the rule 12(c motion into one for summary judgment we do not do so lightly but because of the highly probative nature of the jury view of kimayra the lack of use of less restrictive mean of eliminate the prejudicial effect of the evidence and the arbitrary manner in which the judge proceed which furnish a complementary reason powerful in itself brooks 145 f.3d at 455 we hold that the district court abuse its discretion in disallow the demonstrative evidence then apparently off the record in chamber the district court ban kimayra not only from the courtroom but from the entire courthouse for the duration of trial on such a central issue as causation and in the absence of specific finding of prejudice it would be speculation at good much less with fair assurance to say that the jury verdict be unaffected by the error this statement directly respond to the hospital 's contention that pursuant to applicable law it be not liable for kimayra 's condition and implicitly invite the district court to consider the expert

evident the district court rule before allow a response to the objection there be no finding on prejudice and probativeness and a hair trigger decision be make however rubert torres not only rely upon dr. nathanson 's report for the limited purpose of refute the hospital 's motion to the extent that it be a 12(e motion she also use it to argue the merit of the rule 12(c motion state the departure

with the ruling of the helminski court that a trial court may decide to bar from the courtroom a disabled plaintiff incapable of comprehend judicial proceeding during the liability phase of a trial in order to prevent prejudice the jury before trial the district court enter summary judgment for the hospital additionally in this case the evidence be fundamental to the central issue in the case causation the record reflect that her attorney do not request and the district court do not offer a reason for the decision this be so because in that situation the court must balance the plaintiff 's due process right with the defendant 's right to an unbiased jury trial in her response to the hospital 's rule 12(c motion rubert torres state that the contention in the motion be more properly frame as a motion for a more definite statement under federal rule of civil procedure 12(e and that to the extent that hospital san pablo 's motion be in effect a 12(e motion it have be moot by the provide

court do not enter summary judgment sua sponte rather it convert the hospital 's motion for judgment on the pleading pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure 12(c into a motion for summary judgment

for instance the court might have consider limit the amount of time she would be present before the jury allow she to enter and exit the courtroom outside the jury 's presence and give limit instruction all of which might minimize prejudice without require exclusion in addition even assume the jury view preference be somewhat prejudicial the district court could have use a less -15- restrictive mean to minimize the prejudice than entirely exclude kimayra from the courtroom we also review evidentiary ruling such as the district court 's decision to disallow kimayra 's presence in

clearly the evidence be highly relevant the non movant append at the hearing the defendant have the burden of persuasion to show that the plaintiff should be exclude because his or her mere presence

frulla 's fishery law experience be not the sort of practice specialty that can qualify for an enhanced fee under the statute although the amount of the differential about $ 12,000 be not huge the government have a continue interest in how the cap condition be interpret and apply 1 pertinently the district court find that because of frulla 's expertise his time be properly bill at $ 175 per hour although it reduce the hourly rate for the other two attorney to $ 125 the regulatory scheme the datum and the analysis that lead to the regulation 's downfall be set forth straightforwardly in the district court 's original five page opinion the remainder of the district court case therefore be devoted to plaintiff claim that the government 's position be not substantially justified and that the statute therefore entitle they to attorney 's fee of course the use of a cap construct in this way may be penny wise and pound foolish since a lawyer without frulla 's experience might have to spend far more hour to do the same work leave the government bad off even at the low per hour rate this objection might at first seem only crudely relate to the statutory criterion--""a special factor such as the limited availability of qualified attorney for the proceeding involved""--but the connection be provide by pierce v. underwood 487 u.s. 552 1988 2000 hold under â§ 7430 of the

flavor of the argument and the district court 's treatment of they be easily convey the government cite some circuit authority that could be read in its favor,3 while readily concede that the ninth circuit have take a more liberal view of the statute.4 however we do not read the supreme court or most of the circuit case as adopt a mechanical rule that automatically exclude a specialist from extra compensation merely because no separate credential exist for his field and because no foreign law or 3 see f.j. vollmer co. v. magaw 102 f.3d 591 598 d.c. cir -2- curiously the regulation do not

expertise should be compensate but as the statute be write and as it have be gloss by the supreme court the government be entitle to oppose this request to exceed the cap and on this record to prevail we agree with both of the premise but this be not by a long shot the same as a finding that such an expertise be require in this case but in law practice as with airline fare deviation from the customary rate be legion because the lawyer 's unused hour like empty airline seat be a perishable asset the story begin with the adoption in july 1997 of a new regulation by the secretary of commerce

harvesting of undersized tuna the district court find that the evidence do not support this position but probably point in the other direction of course patent law be itself a specialty but it have

propriety of a class action the question be not whether the plaintiff or plaintiff have state a cause of action or will 6 in all event should wmh demonstrate in the future that individualized statute of limitation problem actually shift the balance and undercut the predominance of common issue the district court may modify its class certification order or even decertify the class the court below do not rely on a generalization like the one that the general telephone court find objectionable but rather engage in a case specific analysis that go well beyond the pleading we conclude on the record present that the district court do not abuse its discretion in certify the plaintiff class p. 23(b)(3 mowbray then move for certification of a class consist of all person who during the period

ex post waiver a circumstance that in all likelihood account for the district court 's silence anent the issue in all event no matter how strong the economic pressure to settle a rule 23(f application

can take early than usual cognizance of important unsettled legal -9- question thus contribute to both the orderly progress of complex litigation and the orderly development of the law but the advisory committee 's note read as a whole do not support this attempt to transplant the certiorari standard root and branch into the virgin soil of rule 23(f wmh oppose class certification arguing

breath however the advisory committee predict that p]ermission be most likely to be grant when the certification decision turn on a novel or unsettled question of law or when as a practical matter the

too far behind the pleading and thus effectively reject the waiver defense on the merit do not preclude certification of a class action so long as the necessary commonality and in a 23(b)(3 class action predominance be otherwise present the court 's opinion read as a whole belie this condemnation nor do eisen fairly read foreclose consideration of the probable course of the litigation at the class certification stage spur in part by the lack of precedent in this newly construct corner of the law we set an expedite briefing schedule and instruct the party to address not only the standard for grant leave to appeal but also the merit of the class certification decision in the meantime proceeding continue in the district court in explicate its reasoning the court reiterate that the class determination generally involve consideration that be enmesh in the factual and legal issue comprise the plaintiff 's cause of action i d. build on this foundation wmh asseverate that the district court do not delve deeply enough before it conclude that the incidence variety and complexity of statute of- limitation issue do not defeat the quest for class certification instead it assess the impact of wmh 's asserted limitation defense vis- ă -vis member of the warranty group acknowledge the lack of 5 see mowbray ii 189 f.r.d. p. 23(f wmh timely petition this court for permission to appeal the class certification order the advisory committee 's note accompany rule 23(f underscore that t]he court of appeal be give unfettered discretion whether to permit the appeal liken this to the supreme court 's authority in grant or deny certiorari.2 2embrace this analogy mowbray argue that because the supreme court grant certiorari only for compelling reason sup the district court agree that individual question predominate over common question with respect to the potential class member who have sell asset pursuant to contract that do not contain express warranty and therefore deny class certification as to this subset of individual but reach the opposite conclusion with 1although mowbray 's motion also mention rule 23(b)(2 this reference appear extraneous give his specific allegation on july 31 1992 robert mowbray sell his business to a predecessor of waste management holdings inc. wmh in exchange for share of wmh 's common stock an order grant certification on the other hand may force a defendant to settle rather than incur the cost of defend a class action and run the risk of potentially ruinous liability nonetheless when c]onfronte with a request for settlement- only class certification a district court need not inquire whether the case if try would present intractable management problem for the proposal be that there be no trial we believe therefore that blair 's third category should be restrict to those instance in which an appeal will permit the resolution of an unsettled legal issue that be important to the particular litigation as well as important in itself and likely to escape effective review if leave hang until the end of the case.3 with this small emendation we adopt the blair taxonomy

lead the officer to believe that he be try to distract she at 309 because his conduct be deliberate.5 a deliberate miranda violation he say constitute per se improper tactic and automatically warrant a presumption of compulsion as to the subsequent statement without regard to the effect of the violation on the voluntariness of the initial statement since esquilin voluntarily consent to the presence of zena and the officer in his motel room the district court correctly conclude that the sniff be not a search.2 esquilin argue far that his consent to the full- blow search of the motel room in which zena find and retrieve the cocaine be not voluntary in the absence of any police coercion there be nothing to hinder esquilin from invoke his right to remain silent after the miranda warning be administer except perhaps his own sense that the initial statement and the discovery of the cocaine have let the cat out of the bag so that he might as well confess in the district court esquilin seek suppression of all the physical evidence discover in the motel room include the cocaine some cash that be discover under a mattress and a piece of paper find in his clothing finally esquilin suggest that the deterrence rationale of the miranda rule would be undercut if a deliberate violation by brady do not result in the suppression of esquilin 's confession even go so far as to claim that elstad could not apply to the present situation without implicitly overrule miranda -7- esquilin expressly consent to the search and the evidence amply support the district court 's finding that the consent be voluntary on the other hand when the prior unwarned statement be not coerce a careful and thorough administration of miranda warning serve to cure the condition that render the unwarned statement inadmissible in elstad the court observe that absent deliberately coercive or improper tactic in obtain the initial statement the mere fact that a suspect have make an unwarned admission do not warrant a presumption of compulsion""4 as to the subsequent statement in elstad the supreme court hold that if a statement obtain in violation of miranda be nevertheless voluntary a subsequent statement be not subject to the fruit of the poisonous tree analysis applicable to a constitutional violation contrary to esquilin 's argument that there be improper tactic that can raise a presumption of compulsion without regard to voluntariness the elstad court hold that there be no warrant for presume coercive effect where the suspect 's initial inculpatory statement though technically in violation of miranda be voluntary the voluntariness of a consent to search turn on an assessment of the totality of the circumstance and it be not essential that the officer first inform the consent party of the right to withhold consent at 306 so it can rebut the presumption of compulsion by demonstrate that the coercion have not carry over into the second confession i d. the court conclude that mr. esquilin voluntarily consent to the officer and the drug detection dog enter his motel room 42 f. supp in response to question from brady esquilin say that he be from new york

holding the passage in carter that esquilin rely on however appear to be dicta on appeal esquilin first contend that the district court err by find that the dog sniff inside the motel room be not a search and that his subsequent consent to search the room be voluntary -11- esquilin contend that brady be guilty of more than a simple failure to administer the warning i d. esquilin gesture at the plastic bag and say because of cocaine after pull out some clothing she pull out a plastic bag contain white powder and accord to hebert throw it in the air and it do the somersault and fall in the middle of the floor although viger and hebert give conflicting testimony at the suppression hearing about what hebert and zena be do while viger and esquilin converse the district court accept hebert 's testimony that zena be sniff throughout the motel 1esquilin argue before the district court that he do not voluntarily consent at least to the entry of the dog after the district court deny esquilin 's motion to suppress physical evidence seize in a search of his motel room and statement he make to the police after his arrest see united states v. esquilin 42 f. supp the addition of a subjective intent by the officer to violate miranda unaccompanied by any coercive conduct can not in itself undermine the suspect 's free will furthermore -13- carter 's assertion that the admissibility of a post warning confession follow a miranda violation be not necessarily determine by whether the two statement be voluntary see i d. -9- esquilin nevertheless argue that elstad be distinguishable because it involve two temporally separate interrogation about an hour apart see 470 u.s. at 301 the first unwarned and the second warn whereas in this case there be only one interrogation with the warning occur mid stream we need not address the legal theory behind this contention raise for the first time on appeal because the record be devoid of evidence that zena move anything until after esquilin consent to a full scale search rely on elstad the district court conclude that esquilin 's unwarned and warn statement be voluntary and decline to suppress the latter the court refuse to suppress the other evidence and esquilin preserve the issue for appeal by enter a conditional guilty plea pursuant to fed the admission of esquilin 's pre warning statement to brady be not at issue esquilin also argue that his first unwarned statement be the product of improper tactic hebert give zena the command to find the dope and she immediately return to the gap bag because brady 's careful and thorough administration of miranda warning serve[d to cure the condition that render the unwarned statement inadmissible -15- i d. it be part and parcel of the elstad holding that a failure to give miranda warning do not without more make a confession involuntary at 311 the court be also correct to conclude that esquilin 's subsequent confession be voluntary the court 's discussion suggest that it may have assume arguendo that the miranda violation be deliberate see i d. indeed the court specifically explain that the factual distinction emphasize by esquilin be of no legal consequence in other word although the elapse time between interrogation be one factor that may dissipate the taint of a coerced confession the less taint of a miranda violation may be dissipate by subsequent warning even if the unwarned and warn statement be obtain during the same interrogation just as the government can purge the taint of an unreasonable search or seizure by show a sufficient break in event to undermine the inference that the confession be cause by the fourth amendment violation i d. on september 17 1998 esquilin be stay at the super 8 motel in westbrook maine

203	203	198874.json	 the government 's evidence support the conclusion that cabrera employ a computer a document scanner a printer and commercial software that together could be use to scan alter and reproduce document cabrera contend that his system be not specially design for the fabrication of false identification document emphasize that the hardware at issue namely the computer printer and scanner be not uniquely suit to such activity the government contend however that the relevant inquiry focus not on the use of some hypothetical user but on cabrera 's own primary use of the computer system subsequently on january 20 1999 a federal grand jury in the district of rhode island return a two count indictment charge inter alia that cabrera possess document make implement with the intent that such implement be use in the production of false identification document in violation of 18 -4- u.s.c. they find cabrera 's computer equipment a board use for measure and trim document microsoft

that cabrera repeatedly use his computer scanner printer software and digitize template to create false identification document the committee 's remark then lend credence to the government 's case specific interpretation of the â€śprimarily usedâ€ť prong at the relevant time period the statute define â€śdocument making implementâ€ť to mean any implement or impression specially design or primarily use for make an identification document a false identification document or another document make implement.1 count one the only count relevant to this appeal2 be base on cabrera 's

and scanner refer to in the indictment we]re document make implements.â€ť the district judge reserve judgment on the motion discussion we address in turn the sufficiency of the evidence support cabrera 's conviction and the district court 's decision to curtail cabrera 's cross examination of agent mooney the government acknowledge that if it be require to prove that as a general matter computer scanner and printer be primarily use for make identification document or false identification document cabrera 's conviction must be overturn because the court be present with no evidence support that conclusion -5- examine he regard the general use to which anyone could put computer equipment the court intervene and the follow sidebar exchange regard the meaning of â§ 1028 's â€śprimarily usedâ€ť prong ensue the court congress might have be a little bit more precise in their definition but as i read that definition in the context of this statute i read it as refer to the possession and the intent of the possessor in put it to use to determine the sufficiency of the evidence we canvass the evidence direct and circumstantial in the light most agreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence include all plausible inference extractable therefrom enable a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant commit the charge crime 3519 3530 however the evidence adduce at trial permit a jury to conclude that cabrera 's system also include software such as the â€śpicture it!â€ť program which testimony indicate â€ścould be use specifically he a assert that under a proper interpretation of â§ 1028 the prosecution present insufficient evidence upon which to ground a conviction and b challenge the district court 's decision to limit the scope of cross examination of a particular government witness on may 21 1999 the jury convict cabrera on count one and the district judge deny his motion for a judgment of acquittal on that count first as the government note congress could have use a word such as â€śgenerallyâ€ť in lieu of â€śprimarilyâ€ť if it intend the meaning that cabrera propose i. sufficiency of the evidence cabrera argue first that his computer system be not prove to constitute a document making implement within the meaning of the statute because â€śthere be no proof either directly sic or by inference that it be while no court appear to have analyze the meaning of this prong it have be find to encompass an assortment of paraphernalia not â€śgenerallyâ€ť use for illicit purpose include laminating machine plastic laminating pouch packet of rub on letter eraser tape scissor and small photograph mr mccormick cabrera 's counsel i want to ask generally if computer equipment be primarily use for the making of the court no because that primarily refer to the possession of this individual not the general public this statement of course accurately describe the template which be merely computer file contain digital image of â€śtext in a distinctive type face and layout.â€ť alone each template form â€śpart of an identification documentâ€ť and together with the insert datum each would constitute a complete document although the court ultimately find that it be primarily use by the defendant for make telephone call and that it therefore do not fall within the ambit of â§ 1029(e)(6 the court 's very pursuit of the inquiry reflect its belief that what matter be the particular use to which the defendant put the device not its â€śgeneralâ€ť use within society in view of the precede ruling this testimony would have be irrelevant and therefore inadmissible we share the government 's view and find that a jury reasonably could have find that cabrera 's equipment be â€śprimarily usedâ€ť for the fabrication of document as that term be set forth in former â§ 1028 first use the aforementioned equipment cabrera scan genuine document into his computer save the image on his computer hard drive and on floppy disk remove or alter the identify information and photograph on the document and then print the document on photographic paper moreover the treatment which former â§ 1028 have be accord by the court suggest that â€śprimarily usedâ€ť refer to the defendant 's primary use of the item in question paper and ink even â€śspecializedâ€ť paper and ink be not â€śgenerallyâ€ť use for the production of false identification document but could in a give case be â€śprimarily usedâ€ť in the service of such end by a particular defendant in fact the more relevant portion of the legislative history be that which precede the language quote above 99 2061 united states appellee v. vladimir cabrera defendant appellant this system be use in conjunction with laminate exacto blade a supply of photographic quality paper and genuine identification document thus she join the opinion to this point as well as part ii and the opinion 's conclusion but decline to join this section medeiro then insert new identify information onto the document trim the counterfeit and laminate they as appropriate so i think that the general use that anyone might put a computer to in this case a computer to be not relevant cabrera keep the computer equipment at his home while the equipment medeiros use be store in a suitcase that the two own jointly see e.g. burlington northern

such other relief the court deem just o'neill say that the essential due process requirement be not fulfil because she do not have specific notice that the purpose of the december 23 meeting be to discuss her impending termination because the decision to terminate she be make prior to the meeting and because the termination letter be draft sign and mail -15- prior to the meeting.8 these fact she say deprive she of real notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond similarly the uncontradicted evidence show that o'neill whether or not she exercise it have a meaningful opportunity to speak in her own defense at a series of meeting up to and include the meeting of december 23 because the fact even when view in the light most favorable to o'neill fail to make out a due process violation

violation or deliberate indifference and in herwins we view zinermon as a case in which state law do authorize the procedure follow albeit unconstitutionally so that the act of the official could not be describe as random and unauthorized zinermon do however require that court scrutinize carefully the assertion by state official that their conduct be random and unauthorized lowe 959 f.2d at 341

long enough for she to vest in the retirement system.3 ii the termination letter be mail to o'neill the day before the termination meeting take place and o'neill receive it at her home on december 24 1993 far the fact that o'neill be advise of her right to have a union representative present and that the meeting be a hearing should have in a practical sense alert she that this meeting would more likely involve more serious discipline than have the prior meeting the district court state that o'neill do not have a constitutional right to a pre termination hearing in these circumstance that the post termination relief available to she under state law be constitutionally adequate and that any challenge to the arbitral award be not properly before the court in july 1993 ruth mcdermott the area director for the chelsea office meet with o'neill about her chronic tardiness and absence from work it be possible that mcdermott 's reading of the letter which say it have be determine that there

important the status of the parratt hudson line of case in the albedo of zinermon be at good uncertain a. pre termination procedures and due process begin with the defendant first argument the record show that the pre termination proceeding provide to o'neill do not 7 in light of our holding we need not examine the other argument the defendant make in support of the grant of summary judgment under the civil service law o'neill have the right to challenge her termination and the termination procedure in two way the complaint as amend seek compensatory damage punitive damage attorney 's fee and

that pop up like a rampant case of impetigo throughout the motion paper should have put the low court on notice that the institute 's main goal be to seek judicial review of the adverse administrative decision.3 we add moreover that even assume contrary to our impression that the district court 's decision to construe the motion for temporary restraining order as the complaint be within its discretion its decision to dismiss the entire action base on a non lawyer 's isolated use of the phrase in the alternative be not accordingly angel ruiz rivera ruiz the institute 's -4- founder and president purport to act both on the institute 's behalf and to his own behoof file a notice of appeal in this court ask that we review the secretary 's determination in the page that follow we summarize the strange series of event that lead to the district court 's dismissal of the action and explain why in the interest of justice we deem it appropriate to vacate the order of dismissal in part and remand for further proceeding the title be misleading although not a model of clarity this submission fairly read seek not only an injunction but also judicial review of the final decision of the secretary.1 indeed the request for relief include a prayer that doe be command to produce its entire administrative record vis ă -vis the institute in order for this appeal of the final agency decision to be able to commence the district court be of course correct in hold that the lease controversy have become moot because the appellant previous counsel have withdraw from the case only ruiz a non lawyer sign the notice of 2 the motion state inter alia that i]t be our humble understanding that we believe that give the peculiar circumstance of this case the district court should have chart such a course before terminate the entire action say by issue a show cause order or otherwise advise the institute that its case be at risk of a final decision of the department of education and transfer it to the district court eschew oral argument the district court issue a terse three page order in which it dismiss the action rather than merely deny the request for a temporary restraining order on the ground that the relief seek by the institute already have be obtain this request stem from an assertion that doe have refuse to furnish another educational institution that wish to lease a building from the institute with an assurance that if it consummate the lease it would not inherit the institute 's 1 by way of illustration the submission state in relevant part that the institute be the appellant in this appeal of the u.s.d.e. the district court apparently influence both by the ambiguity contain in the motion for a temporary restraining order and by doe 's self serve argument erroneously conclude that the abatement of the lease controversy accord the institute all the relief that it seek that be so its thesis run the district court have a perfect right to treat the motion as the institute 's complaint and to -10- construe the phrase in the alternative as erase any need to consider other redress include judicial review of administrative action once the institute have achieve the relief request in regard to the lease controversy because the transfer process be plague by lose document and similar glitch attributable to the court involve not to the party the case be not docket in the -5- district court until october 29 1998 in a footnote the court explain that s]ince the relief seek in the motion for injunctive relief have be provide by defendant the other claim plead in the alternative by plaintiff in their motion be also render moot by the dismissal of this action for lack of controversy for the reason state we affirm the district court 's order with respect to the denial of the motion for a temporary restraining order but vacate it insofar as it purpose to dismiss the entire action unfortunately ruiz choose the wrong forum the district court rather than the court of appeal have original jurisdiction over action for judicial review of the secretary 's final determination this procedural motley stem from the admittedly awkward effort of plaintiff appellant instituto de educacion universal corp. the institute to secure judicial review of a final determination of the united states department of education doe pursuant to the administrative procedure act the apa 5 u.s.c. doe complain that the institute have fail to file a complaint and then shift the focus to one of the institute 's request for injunctive relief the notice of appeal be docket on march 6 1998 well within the six year period allow for seek judicial review of the secretary 's final order the institute then inquire rhetorically if this case be not the appeal of judicial review of the secretary 's final decision doe self servingly characterize the lease controversy as the real issue in the case and contend that because it recently have provide suitable assurance to the prospective lessee the issue be moot thus we hold that a corporate officer may sign and file a notice of appeal on behalf of the corporation as long as the corporation then promptly retain counsel to take up the cudgel and prosecute the appeal on january 24 1997 an administrative law judge alj reverse the clock hour finding but affirm several other agency determination e.g. the excess cash and unpaid refund finding and the decision to debar the institute from participation in federal student aid program follow yet another procedural contretemp the fact of which need not concern we the institute still unrepresented file a document over ruiz 's signature entitle motion for temporary restraining order this tenet rest on the sober reality that p]resumably unskille in the law the pro se litigant be far more prone to make error in plead than the person who benefit from the representation of counsel this be the first of the two opinion we have elect however to decide the two appeal separately the motion for reconsideration however make it clear that the court have misinterpret an admittedly prolix hard to- read pro se plead doe then pounce upon an isolated use of the phrase in the alternative in the institute 's paper â€ to be precise the institute have use the phrase once in a thirty six page submission â€ and argue that the court could ignore the remainder of the institute 's claim include the request for judicial review of the secretary 's final decision because those claim have be proffer only in the alternative at any rate the matter lie fallow until july 24 1998 when we issue an order that interpret the notice of appeal as an attempt to seek review on october 28 1997 the secretary affirm the alj 's decision in part but reinstate the clock hour finding and vacate the debarment decision thus a refusal to reconsider may be overturn if the record make manifest that the court below commit a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reach upon a weighing of the relevant factor under those circumstance the interest of justice require that the court reconsider and modify its early order the matter be remand to the district court with instruction that the institute be give an opportunity to file a complaint seek judicial review of the secretary 's final administrative determination 1978 we believe that a valid distinction can be draw between ongoing legal representation and the essentially ministerial action involve in the filing of a notice of appeal ought to be judicially review and begg[ed the court to hold a conference for the coordination of this judicial review of the final agency decision we hold only that when as now a pleading draft by a pro se party appear non frivolous on its face the court ought not automatically to resolve material ambiguity against the pleader but we think that the record adequately though inartfully raise the separate issue of judicial review of the secretary 's final decision

214	214	198885.json	 the evidence take favorably to the mccanns show that wal mart employee stop the mccanns as they be seek to exit the store say that the child be not allow in the store tell the mccanns that they have to come with the wal- mart employee and that wal mart be call the police and then stand guard over the mccanns while wait for a security guard to arrive against this background we examine wal mart 's claim that the evidence be insufficient take the fact in the light most favorable to the mccanns draw reasonable inference in their favor and assume that the jury resolve credibility issue consistent with the verdict the direction to the mccanns the reference to the police and the continue presence of the wal mart employee who at one point tell jonathan mccann that he could not leave to go to the bathroom be enough to induce reasonable people to believe either that they would be restrain physically if they seek to leave or that the store be claim lawful authority to confine they until the police arrive or both eventually the security officer rhonda bickmore arrive at the store and inform hughes that the mccanns be not the family whose son have be catch shoplift -2- despite debra mccann 's protestation taylor say that they have the record that the police be be call and that the mccanns have to go with she a somewhat different claim by wal mart cite whittaker 85 a. at 402 be that the district court 's instruction be defective because it do not tell the jury that the restraint must be a physical and not merely a moral influence and that influence or convince another to stay be not actual physical restraint take too literally the phrase actual physical restraint would put maine law broadly at odd with not only the restatement but with a practically uniform body of common law in other state that accept the mere threat of physical force or a claim of lawful authority to restrain as enough to satisfy the confinement requirement for false imprisonment assume always that the victim submit use this standard we think that a reasonable jury could conclude that wal mart 's employee intend to confine the mccanns within boundary fix by wal mart that the employee act do result in such a confinement and that the mccanns be conscious of the confinement one of their receipt be time stamp at 10:10 p.m. as the mccanns be leave the store two wal mart employee jean taylor and karla hughes step out in front of the mccanns shopping cart block their path to the exit 1 in context the reference to the necessity of actual physical restraint be well understand as 1 although the distinction may seem a fine one it be well settle that a threat to confine at a future time even if do to extract payment be not itself false imprisonment the district court largely borrow the restatement formulation by tell the jury that it must find the follow one that the defendant act intend to confine the plaintiff within boundary fix by the defendant two that the act of the defendant directly or indirectly result in such a confinement of the plaintiff and third the plaintiff be conscious of the confinement or be harm by it -9- however in this case wal mart do not offer a proper instruction in argue for a different instruction it say to the district court that the restraint must be physical and not merely a moral influence implicate wal mart 's incorrect view that actual physical restraint be require and its further statement that i]nfluence or convince another to remain in place be not actual physical restraint have the same fault and be also open to the criticism that i]nfluence or convincing be itself a misleading phrase at least as present by wal- mart because one could influence or convince by threat of force or assertion of lawful authority which do or can constitute false imprisonment we think it be at least arguable that if a proper instruction be tender it might be appropriate or even obligatory the latter be a nice point that we do not decide to make clear to the jury that there be outer boundary to the confinement concept and that a personal plea by the defendant to remain or the defendant 's invocation of moral obligation alone would not be sufficient to inflict a confinement in assail the instruction wal mart repeat its claim which we have already reject that the district court should have charge that actual physical restraint be require to make out confinement while a police officer be in the room and mrs. knowlton say she think that the door be lock the sjc find that the plaintiff have not be confine by the defendant while we think it be foolish for hughes to tell the 12 year old that he could not go to the bathroom the denial be not outrageous give the failure to press the request although nuance vary from state to state the gist of the common law tort be conduct by the actor which be intend to and do in fact confine another within boundary fix by the actor where -4- in addition the victim be either conscious of the confinement or be harm by it in fact the employee be mistaken the son of a different family have be catch shoplift in the store about two week before and taylor and hughes confuse the two family the court add that the jury could find for the mccanns if it find that the plaintiff reasonably believe they be not -8- permit to leave the store and that the plaintiff do not have to prove that such restraint be accomplish through actual physical force against their body in knowlton the wife of a man who owe a hotel for past bill enter the hotel office and be allegedly tell that she would go to jail if she do not pay the bill after discussion she give the hotel a diamond ring as security for the bill in this case the mccanns contend that hughes 's refusal to permit jonathan to use the bathroom be sufficiently outrageous to support a claim for punitive damage -11- the mccanns insist that the refusal must be consider in conjunction with other fact include an asserted violation by wal mart of its own policy of ask prior shoplifter to leave the store rather than detain they hughes 's action of point her finger at jonathan while accuse he of steal and her failure to clear up the mccanns identity at an early stage hughes then acknowledge her mistake to the mccanns and the mccanns leave the store at approximately 11:15 p.m. she later win a verdict for false imprisonment against the hotel which the maine supreme judicial court then overturn on the ground that the evidence be insufficient under maine law malice can be express as when the defendant be motivate by ill will toward the plaintiff or imply where the defendant 's action be outrageous and not merely reckless or negligent p. 50(b and 59 respectively argue that the mccanns do not prove false imprisonment under maine law and that the court 's jury instruction on false imprisonment be in error wal mart assert that under maine law the jury have to find actual physical restraint a phrase it take from knowlton 95 a. at 283 see also whittaker 85 a. at 402 at that point the issue be drop and neither jonathan nor his mother say another word to the wal mart employee about it on december 11 1996 debra mccann and two of her child jillian then 16 and jonathan then 12 -were shopping at the wal mart store in bangor maine since it do not do the latter we be free from the chore of decide in the abstract -10- whether and when such a limiting instruction would be appropriate finally the mccanns cross appeal from the district court 's pre trial dismissal of their claim for punitive damage 1912 and the district court 's instruction to which we will return seem to have be draw from the restatement in due course the mccanns bring suit against wal mart for false imprisonment a defamation claim be also make but be reject by the jury taylor and hughes then bring the mccanns past the register in the store to an area near the store exit after approximately an hour and a half the mccanns go to a register and pay for their purchase after they return a christmas tree and exchange a cd player jonathan go to the toy section and jillian and debra mccann go to shop in other area of the store the employee tell debra mccann that the child be not allow in the store because they have be catch steal on a prior occasion the few maine case on point contain no comprehensive definition see knowlton v. ross 95 a. the court note that the defendant do not ask mrs. knowlton into the room another guest have send for she do not touch she and do not tell she she could not leave restatement supra â§ 41 99 1355 debra mccann personally and as mother and next friend of jillian mccann and jonathan mccann plaintiffs appellees cross appellants v. wal mart stores inc

early shoplifter the mccann 's testimony be simply that jonathan say once that he need to use the bathroom and hughes tell he he could not the jury award the mccanns $ 20,000 in compensatory damage on their claim that they be falsely imprison in the wal mart store by wal mart employee indeed the restatement provide that confinement may occur by other unspecified mean of duress taylor stand near the

underage enhancement and a two level increase to reflect escalera 's role in those offense see i d. in fact when the district court seek to confirm that the enhancement be appropriate escalera 's attorney explicitly say y]es the government agree with escalera 's position and the district court accept it impose only a two level role enhancement thus in the absence of any meaningful evidence to the contrary the district court be free to credit the psr insofar as it suggest that escalera have play a leadership role in the conspiracy after consider the psr hear argument from counsel and give the defendant the opportunity to speak the district court sentence escalera to seventy month in prison plus five year of supervised release and a $ 1000 special assessment escalera now contend that the district court should not have increase his base offense level to reflect the involvement of an underage individual pursuant to â§ 2d1.2(a)(1 of the guidelines even though he do not challenge this enhancement at sentencing having make the requisite factual finding the district court properly apply a two level role enhancement under â§ 3b1.1(c of the guidelines on appeal escalera challenge both of the sentencing enhancement by the district court escalera 's psr support the conclusion that the defendant have be involve in a drug traffic conspiracy in which he control a source of supply and direct laythe gilley and possibly other to sell cocaine on his behalf escalera 's psr similarly state that laythe who be less than 18 year old for each of the cocaine transaction describe in count 2 through 8 of the indictment have sell cocaine with and at the direction of defendant escalera the defendant orlando escalera appeal the sentence he receive after plead guilty to various drug relate offense during escalera 's plea colloquy the government make an offer of proof that from at least may 5 1997 through september 29 1997 escalera laythe and gilley have conspire -5- to traffic cocaine and have sell at least 599.6 gram of cocaine in nine transaction to an undercover police officer in particular the government represent that from at least may 5 1997 through september 29 1997 laythe sell cocaine with and at the direction of mr. escalera as a result we review the propriety of the two level role enhancement only for plain error â§ 3b1.1(c prescribe a two- level increase i]f the defendant be an organizer leader manager or supervisor in any criminal activity and less than five participant be involve on these fact the district court properly conclude that escalera have use someone under eighteen year old in the commission of an offense thereby warrant a two level increase in his base offense level 1995 b]attle over a defendant 's status and over the scope of the criminal enterprise will almost always be win or lose in the district court for the follow reason we affirm â§ 2d1.1(c)(7 with a two level increase because escalera 's crime involve an underage individual see i d. consistent with rule 32 of the federal rules of criminal procedure a probation officer prepare a presentence report psr that describe the crime that escalera have commit and also discuss his personal background although escalera argue that this provision apply only to some drug- relate crime and not to other such as the one to which he plead guilty he concede that another section of the guidelines would have provide an alternative basis for the same sentencing enhancement give this standard of review we turn to the merit because the conspiracy appear to involve five participant the psr urge the district court to apply a four- level enhancement to escalera 's base offense level whether support by â§ 2d1.2 or â§ 3b1.4 of the guidelines it be evident that the district court have the authority to increase escalera 's offense level by two if he use someone under eighteen year old to commit the crime at issue conclusion -9- for the foregoing reason we affirm the district court 's sentence before escalera plead guilty the government make an offer of proof that detail his involvement in the drug- trafficking conspiracy we will uphold the trial court 's decision to apply the enhancement unless that decision -4- constitute a plain error that affect substantial right and that would seriously affect the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceeding if leave unredressed background on october 9 1997 a grand jury indict escalera tonya laythe scott gilley and rolando cartagena on a number of drug traffic charge escalera 's psr confirm that escalera have be the decision maker and leader of the conspiracy escalera also argue that the district court err in apply the role in the offense enhancement to his sentence the court also reduce escalera 's offense level by three find acceptance of responsibility mr. escalera arrange for the receipt of cocaine from his source and laythe would make and receive telephone call to arrange the sale of that cocaine and then deliver the cocaine to customer â§ 3b1.4 prescribe a two level enhancement if the defendant use or attempt to use a person less than eighteen year of age in the commission of an offense on march 26 1998 escalera plead guilty to all count when ask escalera advise the district court that he agree with this proffer and that he have nothing to add to it by ask the district court to impose a two level role enhancement at sentencing escalera almost certainly waive his right to object to that enhancement on appeal johnson v. united states 520 u.s. 461 467

overstate the government 's burden to the defendant 's benefit by demand proof of a -13- high level of intent than â§ 113(a)(5 actually require collectively the decision support the conclusion that in a prosecution for simple assault under â§ 113(a)(5 it be sufficient to show that the defendant deliberately touch another in a patently offensive manner without justification or excuse p. 29(c it shall not be necessary to the making of such a motion that a similar motion have be make prior to the submission of the case to the jury see united states v. turley 352 u.s. 407 411 1957 w]here a federal criminal statute use a common law term of establish meaning without otherwise define it the general practice be to give that term its common law meaning in any event the district court refuse

surround bayes 's case the court conclude that the defendant 's unwillingness to accept responsibility for assault smoak the impact of his conduct on the specific victim of the assault charge and the risk that his conduct pose on an airplane in mid flight warrant the imposition of the maximum allowable prison term bayes concede that this sentence be within the range that â§ 113(a)(5 permit but argue that it be plainly unreasonable to give he the maximum allowable term of imprisonment if this instruction accurately describe the level of intent that â§ 113(a)(5 require then we might question

228	228	198900.json	 in this circuit such a collateral order must be distinct from the merit definitive as to the issue to be review affect interest that could not be vindicate by appeal after a final judgment and present a significant legal issue as oppose for example to the mere challenge to the exercise of discretion section 4241(d)--the centerpiece of this case provide inter alia that where the district court find a defendant incompetent to stand trial by reason of mental disease or defect the court shall commit the defendant to the custody of the attorney general who be require to hospitalize the defendant for treatment and for such a reasonable period of time not to exceed four month as be necessary to determine whether there be a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future the defendant will attain the capacity to -2- permit the trial to proceed turn to the merit we assume arguendo that the statute mean exactly what it say namely that the district court have no discretion in the matter and must commit the defendant for an initial period of up to four month after find he incompetent to stand trial the due process clause have be take to protect certain fundamental right from unreasonable impairment even where there be no challenge to the fairness of the procedure use washington v. glucksberg 117 s. ct 2258 2267 1997 and among such right an individual 's interest in his liberty -6- be surely at the top of the list for two reason one practical and the other precedential we think the statute be constitutional instead the court conclude that where a defendant be find incompetent to stand trial congress have provide for automatic hospitalization for a limited period to permit an inpatient diagnosis and it reject filippi 's constitutional attack on the statute in our view congress could reasonably think that in almost all case temporary incarceration would permit a more careful and accurate diagnosis before the court be face with the serious decision whether to defer trial indefinitely and quite often to release the defendant back into society although the supreme court have not squarely decide the issue before we it do face in jackson v. indiana 406 u.s. 715 1972 the general issue of commit those find incompetent to stand trial here the order that filippi be challenge be his initial commitment which be now occur and the constitutional issue he seek to present be address and expressly decide by the district court the constitutional question be whether automatic commitment with substantial safeguard as to duration be a reasonable and sufficiently narrowly tailor accommodation of the compete interest here the district judge order report at 30 day interval and the record reflect the expectation that the detention will not last the entire four month in -7- addition to the cap on the initial diagnosis limit it to a maximum of four month the statute provide that the period of incarceration be only for such a reasonable period of time as for the significance of the legal issue it be true that the two circuit that have address the constitutional issue both agree with the government and uphold the statute the government do not concede that filippi be irreversibly incompetent but the district court make no finding on the point however filippi assert that the order incarcerate he for up to four month be reviewable under the collateral order doctrine see cohen v. beneficial indus on the question of jurisdiction filippi concede that the commitment order be not a final decision resolve this case within the meaning of 28 u.s.c. but no such extraordinary claim have be press in this case and whatever the possible implicit exception the statute certainly establish a general rule of some breadth and do not appear to call for any case by case choice by the district court as to whether to incarcerate once the incompetency finding have be make although the finding of incompetency be to filippi 's liking the commitment order be not on the practical side the statute be categorical in determine who shall be incarcerate but it be much more flexible and case- orient in determine the length of incarceration filippi 's liberty be certainly be impair by the order but clearly the government have a compelling interest in pursue the diagnosis filippi after all have be indict by a grand jury for serious crime but now claim that he can not be try and punish because his mental condition make he unable to assist his counsel thus there be enough significance to the issue to warrant review under the collateral order doctrine like the district court this court deny the stay but we expedite this appeal he object on the ground that the medical evidence show that he suffer from vascular dementia that the condition be irreversible and that therefore confinement for purpose of diagnosis serve no legitimate purpose and thus violate the due process clause see e.g. 18 u.s.c. 00 1071 united states of america appellee v. peter a. filippi defendant appellant this may be an overstatement suppose for example the defendant be close to -5- death 3182 3418 thereafter in january 2000 the district court find that filippi be not competent to stand trial and should be commit to a federal facility for evaluation for a period not to exceed four month pursuant to 18 u.s.c. but the issue be an open one in this circuit its importance be obvious both for this case and many other and we think the constitutional attack be not frivolous even though we ultimately reject it and believe it reasonably clear that the supreme court would do likewise after a limited examination the government 's psychiatrist agree the present statute be self evidently build upon jackson congress having

commitment it uphold in principle commitment for a reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there be a substantial probability that the defendant will attain that capacity in the

position at trial.1 the district court conduct a lengthy hearing on admissibility of the dna evidence under daubert v. merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc. 509 u.s. 579 592 1993 and hold that any flaw in dr. deadman 's application of an otherwise reliable methodology go to weight and credibility and not to admissibility however the district courtâ€ ™ s find on willfulness be not clear error the

prove the existence of a single racketeering enterprise racketeering conspiracy or a broad conspiracy to commit armed robbery at good he contend the jury could only have find small enterprise or conspiracy with a change cast of conspirator despite an interruption in -10- mcdonald 's role cause by his temporary imprisonment on a parole violation and o'halloran 's somewhat late arrival in the scheme enough evidence exist of a common and continue aim similar method of operation continuity in personnel and interdependence to permit the court to send the separate count to the jury and the jury to find a rico enterprise a rico conspiracy and a broad conspiracy to rob bank and armored car the remain count minus particular racketeering act and overt act as to which no evidence be present

carjack in relation to the hudson robbery 1995 rely on the view that cross- examination presentation of contrary evidence and careful instruction on the burden of proof be the proper challenge to shaky but admissible evidence however the case law make clear that the second sentence be definitional that the statute be intend to adopt the felony murder rule and for a state felony the malice element be satisfied by the intent to commit the unlawful felony.3 the four defendant argue that the district court have no basis for find malice aforethought and wrongly shift to the defendant the burden of show that they do not intentionally cause the death of the guard 1981 in find that these statement be more probably than not make during and in furtherance of the conspiracy the print be dust but not lift during the first inspection of the truck it be conceal because a door be open and burke argue at trial that the print later lift come from a different truck and that the government

crime charge the four with -30- the carjack incident to the hudson robbery most circuit that have speak have agree with this approach see e.g. united states v. johnson 56 f.3d 947 1 at the pre trial daubert hearing dr. deadman testify that the dna testing he perform on the sweat from the cap match stephen burke 's blood sample on may 8 1998 the court impose sentence on each of the defendant a

mention the possibility of a fourth amendment claim on the fact allege in the complaint and although this possibility be raise by the court at oral argument we need not venture into this subject because the appellant fail to raise any fourth amendment theory of recovery before the district court or in their brief on appeal and have therefore waive any such claim at one point cruz erazo go to

that the defense seem at least at first glance inappropriate in a case such as this where the conduct be allege to be an intentional abuse of official power although the court refuse to condone such despicable and wrongful harassment it hold that the conduct do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation at 754 and note the supreme court 's admonition that the activity complain of must do

there be a comparable scheme in 1995 it may not have apply to bilida ironically because she do not hold a permit the supreme court uphold this second entry seemingly because of the continue urgent need to determine the cause of the fire so as to rule out the risk of 6accord e.g. dicesare v. stuart 12 f.3d 973 978 10th cir 1998 cert in general this warrant requirement apply to civil as well as criminal search soldal v. cook county 506 u.s. 56 66 67 n.11 1992 and whether the entry be by the police or some other government official michigan v. tyler 436 u.s. 499 504 05 1978 our opinion establish that if the fact be as bilida claim the fourth amendment do not permit a warrantless entry and seizure of the racoon at the time the racoon be actually seize on the theory that this be a mere continuation of a prior lawful entry having take the racoon the officer then consult with the deputy chief of the department thomas greene and he in turn contact susan littlefield the state 's public health veterinarian it be hard to see why a new entry after the legally enter officer have leave the premise and for a quite different purpose should avoid the warrant requirement absent some new exigent circumstance or other excuse for fail to get a warrant.6 we can not be certain how the supreme court would view this matter since michigan v. tyler 436 u.s. 499 1978 send conflicting signal uncertain whether possession of the raccoon be legal he call nora legault the city 's animal control officer and then leave the premise a warrant probable cause exigent circumstance follow the suppression order the state abandon the prosecution of bilida the reason be that the interest and incentive of the individual police or official be not identical to those of the state and the officer normally have little control over the conduct of a criminal proceeding.4 thus whether there be a violation remain an open issue in our view these circumstance establish qualified immunity for these two officer who be the only present individual defendant implicate in the seizure as oppose to the destruction of the animal nevertheless the due process clause protect property interest and while the notion of property interest have be stretch quite far in certain context e.g. goldberg v. kelly 397 u.s. 254 1970 it depend importantly on what interest be recognize under state law -17- however belmonte and disarro do know from the radio dispatcher that a superior officer one captain tyler have direct they to go to bilida 's address and seize the racoon they claim and the district court hold that the original entry of officer brierly be justify as an exigent circumstance viz the security alarm signal that he be investigate that mia be then notice by brierly and subject to a seizure without a warrant under the plain view doctrine and that the later entry into the backyard by belmonte and disarro and their seizure of the raccoon be an extension of brierly 's early entry and sighting of the raccoon and do not need to be independently support by a warrant a number of case hold as the district court do here that a claimant have no property interest in per se contraband -14-

not liable for damage in any event the district judge think that neither of these ground although permissible in the abstract be make out by the circumstance of this case and the defendant do not

that the appellee cause they any harm even assume that the bank 's loan amount to â€śonlyâ€ť $ 300,000 the distefanos can not prove that their claim loss result from the appellee behavior even a generous accounting of the appellee specific misdeed suggest that the distefanos could prove at most a $ 30,000 loss result from those actions.12 this figure do not even approach the $ 119,000 loss

its estimation the cba be not a minimum standard contract and thus deprive the employer of the freedom to pay more than the stipulate wage in mount this challenge the union brush aside the cba 's definition of seniority as the period of employment with supervalu in the work cover by this agreement at the terminal or terminal within the jurisdiction of the local and posit that year service â€ the critical integer in the bonus day equation â€ be a broad term that could include period in the employ of slf here the cba only set forth a minimum and the wage rate pay to the transferee and sanction by the arbitrator be not inconsistent with it in a case in which the arbitrator purport to interpret the language of a collective bargaining agreement a party who seek judicial review ordinarily must demonstrate that the award be contrary to the plain language of the cba and that the arbitrator heedless of the contract language prefer instead to write his own prescription for industrial justice place the remark in context clarify their possible role in the decisional calculus.6 toward the beginning of arbitrator cooper 's discussion he write that o]nce the fact be determine an arbitrator 's first step be to look at the party agreement and if the clear and unambiguous language of that agreement do not answer the question pose the party conduct should be use to help decipher their intent the first poisonous plant bloom when the union act on the transferee behalf grieve the allocation of bonus day i.e. extra personal day charge that under article 25 of the cba the transferee entitlement to bonus day should be determine in light of their year of service with 1 to offer a few illustration the transfer worker be treat like experienced hand in that they be exempt from the 60 day probationary period for new hire impose by article 2 of the cba and receive credit toward vacation eligibility for the time they have work with slf in that case however the cba specify a maximum as well as a minimum wage and the award rate of pay exceed the cap the arbitral award at issue here stem rationally if not inevitably from the arbitrator 's construction of the cba it complain that at the arbitration hearing the arbitrator deny its representative the opportunity to present evidence among other thing the cba designate local 42 as the exclusive bargaining agent for its member lay out wage rate for the multi year period cover by the pact distinguish in the process between present and new full time employee and set out guideline for the allocation of benefit for example the cba dictate that all new full time employee would reach the top rate in their classification after seven year but on the union 's interpretation some casual worker would receive the top rate simultaneous with their engagement as regular full time employee leapfrog more senior member of local 42 in the process.3 the arbitrator express grave doubt that the party 3 this would create a stark inequity in regard to worker who have be recall after force layoff in this type of case the district court 's authority and hence our authority be very tightly circumscribe the court be not authorize to reconsider the merit of an award even though the party may allege that the award rest on error of fact or on misinterpretation of the contract the arbitrator find additional support for the theory that year of service and seniority be independent variable in the differ use of those term within the four corner of the cba a review of the term use in the agreement show that where the intent be to provide an employee with a benefit that be non competitive i.e. do not impact on any other employee such as bonus day and entitlement to vacation day the party use the synonymous term of date of hire or year of service or length of service or the period of employment with the company and in the company 's employ all mean essentially the same thing when all be say and do court must confine themselves to determine whether the arbitrator 's construction of the contract be in any way plausible labor relations div 29 f.3d at 743 and the decision here pass that undemande test even if his usage be susceptible to the union 's charge that he impermissibly read a timeliness provision into the cba a mere ambiguity in the opinion accompany an award which permit the inference that the arbitrator may have exceed his -18- authority be not a reason for refuse to enforce the award begin at that time the cba make provision for casual employee i.e. part time worker hire as need to toil in the andover warehouse and those employee collectively have come to constitute the pool from which most new full time worker be recruit second the union contend that whereas article 13 create only two classification of regular full time employee the arbitrator take it upon himself to rewrite the agreement and construct another category first the union assert that the arbitrator impermissibly rely upon the transferee acquiescence in regard to their wage rate reliance which in the union 's view contradict the union 's status as the transferee exclusive bargaining representative in respect to wage the question for the transferee then be whether the wage unilaterally impose by the employer breach the cba -16- provision right or wrong have a plausible basis in the language and structure of the cba because we agree that the arbitrator regardless of whether his decision be right or wrong act within the realm of the authority vest in he by the applicable collective bargaining agreement we affirm 7 view in this light the arbitral decision do not amend the cba but rather derive its essence from the cba whatever word be use however all the formulation reflect the idea that a court ought not to vacate an arbitral award as long as the arbitrator be even arguably construe or apply the contract and act within the scope of his authority we hasten to add that arbitrator cooper 's rendition of the wage provision seem reasonable â€ especially since the party know when the cba be sign that the category of new employee under the previous cba have be deem to include former casual employee for wage purpose for that reason we see no problem in approve the instant decision base on the arbitrator 's plausible construction of the term new and minimum hourly wage without more but we do not review arbitral decision for style point and the arbitrator 's core message â€ that the cba as draft permit the employer unilaterally to pay class of employee more but not less than the agree minimum wage â€ come through with sufficient precision to cinch matter although rational mind can differ about whether the arbitrator accurately divine the party intent the standard of review do not allow an inquire court to second guess the correctness of that determination the statutory argument be therefore waive this be the same whine â€ a protest against the arbitrator 's construction of the term minimum 7we note in pass that for much the same reason the high wage do not contravene article 9(c which bar attempt[s to arrange other condition of employment with any of its employee than be set forth in this agreement after weigh cros motion for summary judgment the court determine that the union 's jeremiad amount to no more than a litany of factual and legal error allegedly make by the arbitrator and conclude that it lack authority to intercede the opposite be true in the current case the company never count from the date of hire to determine the appropriate wage rate for casual employee in resolve the second grievance favorably to the employer the arbitrator give short shrift to the union 's claim that supervalu be in breach because it have pay the transfer worker more than the wage stipulate in article 13 for new employee third the union charge that the arbitrator depart from his proper province when he allow supervalu to pay the transferee more than the minimum hourly wage for new worker specify in the cba supervalu reject the grievance assert that year of service like seniority have to be calculate from the date it hire an employee to work full time at andover the union claim that acquiescence be irrelevant and that the arbitrator 's reliance on it effectively rewrote the cba and frustrate the union 's prerogative as the exclusive negotiating agent for all the employee in the bargaining unit include those who transfer from slf about two month before the cba take effect supervalu acquire the business of a competitor sweet life foods slf which operate a grocery warehouse in northboro massachusetts 42 local 42 or the union a teamsters affiliate invite a federal district court to vacate a labor arbitrator 's award in favor of supervalu inc. supervalu or the employer the fact that the slf transferee be not treat generically as new hire unlike another group that have previously join the work force from an acquire company contribute heavily to her conclusion that supervalu have breach the cba in compute the transferee entitlement to bonus day without regard to year service include time spend at slf).2 the battleground then shift to wage and in particular to article 13 of the cba govern minimum hourly wage a local 42 calumnize the arbitrator 's comment that w]hile the union do not agree to the transferee wage rate the general acquiescence by the employee involve should be infer to the union thus the union 's claim of error fail the arbitrator 's award whether or not mistaken result directly from his interpretation of two term set forth in article 13 of the cba new and minimum hourly wage put another way to the extent that the arbitral award properly can be characterize as embody a conclusion that the cba function like a minimum standard contract that be a legal conclusion which fall outside the narrow confine of judicial review it do not ignore the plain language of the contract misco 484 u.s. at 38 because new plausibly

al 's service station the corporation at $ 390,000 and then assign $ 175,000 of this total to the l]and building and installation own personally by lizotte and thus subject to the attachment on september 18 1995 the trustee in bankruptcy richard p. salem notify the court and creditor of his intention to compromise the judgment for $ 100,000 p. 2004 to examine lizotte gulf and the corporation limited however to information concern the term of the sale and to whom the proceed have gone.2 the permit discovery move at a snail 's pace in the end the bankruptcy court approve the proposal subject to the follow condition if the gas station be sell within two year from october 19 1995 the trustee may move for revocation of this approval lizotte maintain that the business asset represent most of the value thus he propose to satisfy the first mortgage remit $ 100,000 to salem to complete the settlement and pay the remain net proceed to the corporation 's creditor the large of which apparently be gulf oil or its distributor new england petroleum the district court affirm these twin determination hold 1 that the bankruptcy court do not err in find the november 1990 fee agreement unenforceable and 2 that the bankruptcy court 's allowance of the claim in an amount equal to one third of the actual recovery be reasonable and do[es not constitute an abuse of discretion for present purpose the acid test of the bankruptcy court 's decision be not whether press onward might have produce more fund for the estate but rather whether accept the settlement and thereby forgo the risk inherent in intransigence fall within the universe of reasonable alternative in this instance the decision whether to seek revocation of the settlement have be poke prod and probe at some length when the debtor later file for bankruptcy and leblanc serve a proof of claim base on the november 1990 fee agreement the agreement prove as much necrotic as neoteric the bankruptcy court strike it down as violative of rule 3:05(5)(e of the rules of the supreme judicial court of massachusetts which at the time provide in pertinent part that a contingent fee shall not exceed state maximum -10- percentage of the amount collect 4 the court do not disallow leblanc 's claim entirely however but allow it to the extent of one third of the amount of the litigation proceed ultimately collect upon consider all the available evidence the court elect as its discretion fully allow to accept the trustee 's recommendation in the end it approve leblanc 's claim to the extent of one third of the amount actually realize on the judgment against lizotte the situation thus be reminiscent of in re thompson in which we write t]he baseline for appellant opposition to the propose settlement rest in their readiness to second guess the inform judgment of the chapter 7 trustee as well as the discretionary determination of the bankruptcy court that continue litigation would not result in a net benefit to the chapter 7 estate 1999 mailman i and an abbreviated version borrow heavily from the original suffice here.1 in october 1990 the debtor represent by attorney gary r. leblanc win a verdict in excess of $ 450,000 against alfred c. lizotte in an environmental suit the ascertained fact as reveal by the record convince we that the bankruptcy court do not exceed the wide boundary of its discretion in determine that a bird -9- in the hand be worth more than continued shake of a potentially barren bush in our view the allowance of the claim pass the test of reasonableness with fly color with these tenet in mind we consider the particular of the appellant 's claim the court therefore have the right â€ and arguably the duty â€ to refuse to enforce it in all event assess the reasonableness of claim for counsel fee be a matter in which the court of first instance enjoy particularly great leeway in re i do not trust 143 f.3d at 3 and there be no sign that the bankruptcy court 's allowance of leblanc 's claim in a sum less than he have hope outstrip that leeway in an abundance of caution it remand for further finding and ultimately affirm the decision of the bankruptcy court -13- the proof of the pudding be in the tasting by leave open the possibility of fee in excess of the state percentage that agreement plainly run afoul of the then applicable ethical canon s.j.c. the district court affirm and so do we the debtor originally retain leblanc to handle the environmental suit pursuant to a write retainer agreement date june 20 1988 that specify a one third contingent fee base on the verdict jury award or settlement an early opinion of this court adumbrate the relevant background see leblanc v. salem in re mailman steam carpet cleaning corp. 196 f.3d 1 2 4 1st cir this bring we to the reasonableness of the allowance contend that this allocation be a sham and would fraudulently divert $ 360,000 from lizotte 's creditor include the debtor leblanc move to compel salem to seek revocation of the order conditionally approve the settlement so view leblanc 's complaint reduce to a quarrel over the percentage that the court deem appropriate back these sum out of the sale price leave only $ 200,000 on the table â€ some of which obviously would have to be devote to closing cost taxis attorney fee and the like see e.g. i d. depend on the fact of the sale the court will then either confirm or revoke its approval since the november 1990 fee agreement have purport to supplant not merely supplement the original fee agreement the bankruptcy court determine that it would consider not only the original agreement but also equitable doctrine betimes the debtor attach a parcel of commercial real estate upon which al 's service station a corporation control by lizotte operate a gulf station in an effort to secure the judgment an individual creditor be the more appropriate arbiter of the good interest of the chapter 7 estate consequently the district court conclude that the bankruptcy court have not abuse its discretion that end the matter as the appellant acknowledge 3 strike on a different front leblanc simultaneously file an adversary proceeding against salem in which he allege negligence and breach of fiduciary duty stem from salem 's failure to seek revocation of the settlement the district court also review the fact we appreciate that notwithstanding the district court 's imprimatur we must independently review the bankruptcy court 's determination at a hearing hold on april 15 1998 leblanc recount his version of the pertinent fact and the conclusion that he have draw from his investigation apparently unimpressed the bankruptcy court overrule his objection and authorize salem to surrender the right to seek revocation we glean from the record that the court think this sum reasonable in relation to the service render and to the result achieve and believe that such an award would prevent unjust enrichment of the bankruptcy estate see in re i do not 4in the district of massachusetts both the federal district court and the bankruptcy court have incorporate the supreme judicial court 's ethical standard into their own rule

and make statement that support the government 's version of the fact this evidence in the aggregate be adequate to support the finding that tes have agree to the criminal scheme and have commit overt act in furtherance of it under the aiding and abet theory by contrast it would suffice that footman cause the woman to be transport across state line for the purpose of prostitution begin in the summer of 1996 the young woman be transport to new castle delaware where they work their trade at a truck stop and give their earning to footman overall the evidence be sufficient to support the verdict footman pay for the bus ticket and a.m. give the money they make to footman the woman travel -15- in footman 's car and tes register for the motel room in particular footman say that the other prostitute also register for room and send money back to he as tes do and so she be indistinguishable the trial judge initially explain to the jury that it could convict footman under either a direct

13,870.50 the district court do not rest on a lack of record but rather on the conclusion that cofield approve and owens receive payment for inappropriate expenditure shall recover threefold the damage by it sustain and the cost of the suit 2000 the court in its discretion may allow the prevail party accord to cofield the present suit be selective enforcement in violation of the equal protection clause yick wo v. hopkins 118 u.s. 356 1886 as incorporate in the fifth amendment the court reject the government 's request for double damage and attorney 's fee the court note cofield 's uncompensated year of service to the project and owens 's past recovery in litigation of large sum for the benefit of the project the absence of fraud charge and the government 's refusal shortly before trial to accept a settlement offer from the defendant for $ 63,000 in december 1992 hud secure a court order to replace the management of the project and hud later foreclose on the property nevertheless we think that the government be entitle under the law as we have clarify it to an opportunity to persuade the district court that the conduct of the defendant reflect sufficient fault to warrant double damage despite the defendant past service on the merit the district court find that the allege discrepancy in treatment claim by cofield be explain by other factor in particular as to the $ 50,000 that no other law firm have be pay without submit a bill evidence the service in question in any event the court permit cofield to offer evidence on the issue at trial and reject it on the merit so we treat the claim as preserve however the government explain that the amount of ineligible expense be less than for those bill by owens and again that the other firm be not pay any money without submit a bill in sum the district court provide a plausible explanation for its conclusion and again owens have not show that the finding be clear error the district court may have feel that the defendant after many year of service be no bad than careless in the transaction in question as to the $ 50,000 payment the court find that it be not a payment for previously unpaid work in the roofing litigation that no such unpaid work have be document by cofield or owens and that the payment be at good an impermissible retainer for unspecified work which be reflect in the project 's record in a reasonable condition for a proper audit hud and ultimately the u.s. attorney 's office make demand on cofield and owens for adequate explanation and/or for the return of the dispute amount $ 50,000 and $ 13,870.50 it be similarly clear from the legislative history of the amendment to section 1715z-4a provide for double damage and attorney 's fee that congress mean to encourage more enforcement by federal authority h.r. after audit the government take the position that owens have previously be pay in full by roxse homes for all of his work on the roofing case and that the $ 50,000 be not a justified expenditure as for the $ 13,870.50 cofield 's brief contain only general assertion of discrepant treatment and undeveloped reference to transcript and document exhibit from which we can not construct a coherent argument on the contrary some of the referenced material help the government imagine for example that owens have in fact perform service and properly bill for the $ 50,000 but in a retrospective evaluation the payment be find by a close margin to be an unreasonable operate expense of the project or suppose that payment of a plausible bill be authorize by cofield in good faith but the documentation be later find not quite sufficient the crux of the argument be cofield 's claim that i]t be implicit in the statute that hud have to make a request on the project owner for such book record and other document and roxse have no opportunity to make such book record and other document available for audit when it be not ask james e. cofield jr. be the chairman of the board of roxse homes from 1971 until 1992 and henry f. owens iii be an attorney who represent roxse homes in various matter start in the early 1970 the project be build in 1969 subject to a mortgage insure by the department of housing and urban development hud and it be own and operate by a non profit corporation roxse homes inc. roxse homes until hud take over the project in 1992 the district court do not pass on the merit of these common law claim treat they as supersede by the judgment in favor of the government on the statutory claim owens concede that he be the attorney for the project in various matter and therefore its agent in a conventional sense a regulatory agreement 1 in addition to its statutory claim the united states make claim of conversion breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against the defendant the district court trace in detail the chronology of bill and payment relate to the roofing case and it find that all of owens 's bill on that case have be pay in october 1995 the united states file this suit against cofield owens owens associates and roxse homes to recover $ 63,870.50 plus interest double damage and cost include attorney 's fee while a set of project minute contain a summary reference by cofield to the suppose $ 50,000 debt for past service there be no bill from the law firm and apparently no documentation in the book and record of the service allegedly perform the statute far provide for purpose of this section a use of asset or income in violation of the regulatory agreement or any applicable regulation shall include any use for which the documentation in the book and account do not establish that the use be make for a reasonable operate expense or necessary repair of the project and have not be maintain in accordance with the requirement of the secretary and in reasonable condition for proper audit document record and other related paper of the project must be maintain in a reasonable condition for proper audit -7- here the expenditure that the district court find to be improper be payment to owens or his law firm by the project so owens 's agency responsibility be clearly implicate an add problem be the lack of clarity in the statute as to what level of scienter if any be require for a violation and what causal connection must be show between the violation and any claim loss and incentive aside in all case the award of attorney 's fee tend more completely to make the injure party whole rather as the legislative history confirm the double damage provision be adopt simply to provide a great deterrent to violation these concern encourage we to leave to the informed judgment of the district court the decision whether the award of double damage be just in the

close of discovery to september 1 1998 and adjust all other deadline accordingly the deposition notice prescribe september 1 1998 as the date for these deposition subsequently doe move in federal court for dismissal without prejudice of his federal action pursuant to rule 41(a)(2 moreover in determine whether two party be in privity court often look to the commonality of their interest in the matter as urohealth note in its brief doe â€śconducte no discovery and do nothing to advance his case for that matter from october 8 1997 to august 27 1998.â€ť the district court twice reprimand doe for his failure to meet discovery deadline and for his discovery abuse to the extent the district court permissibly consider the potential prejudice stem from urohealth 's have to litigate on behalf -10- of dacomed in the state case 4 we find an abuse of discretion because the court err in find no privity between the company accordingly we disagree with the district court 's legal conclusion that the lawsuit against the subsidiary could be maintain in state court if the motion for summary judgment be grant in favor of the parent on the merit 1989 see also e.g. 2 restatement supra â§87 cmt see e.g. pan am we do think that a plaintiff can not conduct a serious product liability claim in a federal court provoke over a year 's worth of discovery and motion practice allow the case to reach the stage at which the defendant file a full scale summary judgment motion and then when matter seem to be go badly for plaintiff simply dismiss its case and begin all over again in a state court in what be essentially an identical proceeding we do not suggest that the parent subsidiary relationship automatically establish privity but give the relationship of the company in this case couple with their joint involvement with the product in question we have little doubt that a rhode island court would treat a merit judgment in favor of urohealth as resolve an identical claim against its wholly own subsidiary at the same time it be very difficult to imagine in the circumstance of this case a no prejudice dismissal at plaintiff 's behest that would not involve payment by the plaintiff of the defendant 's attorney 's fee and other expense of litigation in federal court to date the dura ii originally be design and manufacture by the dacomed corporation â€śdacomedâ€ť which urohealth acquire as a wholly own subsidiary in 1995 after the acquisition urohealth manufacture and sell the dura ii to physician and hospital this result do not necessarily preclude the possibility that for some other reason the district court could dismiss the case without rule on the summary judgment motion but give the record it be somewhat difficult to discern what that reason might be -9- the district court then indicate that even though the pace factor favor urohealth it do not believe that urohealth would â€śtruly suffer legal prejudiceâ€ť if it dismiss the federal lawsuit without prejudice because urohealth still would have to litigate these claim on behalf of dacomed in the state suit an assessment of -13- the legal rule that would be apply by a rhode island court however present a clear cut legal issue on which no special deference be due to the district court an evaluation of the re judicata effect normally would not be part of the rule 41(a)(2 analysis but this case be unusual because of the relationship of the two entity in its order grant doe 's motion the district court first reference the four factor enumerate in pace 3 the district court suggest that because the discovery from the federal case would apply in the state case the fact that urohealth have considerable discovery expenditure do not weigh against grant doe 's motion we appreciate that any decision by the district court on such motion if unaffected by error on a matter of law be entitle to considerable deference see e.g. hart steel co. v. railroad supply co. 244 u.s. 294 298 1917 acton

the third requirement knowledge of a mistake in identity the statute of limitation have run and the district court repulse this effort 1561 1567 n.d. ga. 1992 e]ven the most liberal interpretation of

which be draft by a lawyer represent the insurer â€ name only the policyholder raymond boulanger as a defendant and misdescribe he as the operator of the jeep but when as in kilkenny the defendant have serve responsive pleading an amend complaint can be file only by leave of the court or by write consent of the adverse party we agree with the wilson court that rule 15(c)(3 be not design to remedy a mistake in the selection of a legal theory.6 see i d. virtually by definition every mistake involve an element of negligence carelessness or fault â€ and the language of rule 15(c)(3 do not

substitute the government should relate back under rule 15(c)(3 1 there be no showing that the government have receive timely notice 2 there be no basis for impute knowledge of a mistake to the

point but move to amend the complaint by substitute parry as the defendant see leonard slip op see leonard slip op july 22 1999 in this instance it be plain from the face of the original complaint â€ which erroneously state that boulanger be drive at the time of the accident â€ that leonard make a mistake concern the identity of the proper party defendant since raymond boulanger maureen 's husband have arrange for insurance on the jeep the leonards attorney contact the carrier with a view toward settlement of the personal injury claim the statute of limitation run on february 28 1998 under the clear language of rule 15(c post filing event include inaction 4 the court also draw support from pessotti v. eagle manufacturing co. 946 f.2d 974 1st cir there be no reason to think that this bevue a few case tend to suggest that if plaintiff 's own inexcusable neglect be responsible for the failure to name the correct party an amendment substitute the proper party will not be allow notwithstanding adequate notice to the new party the district court grant the motion to amend without prejudice simultaneously dismiss the action as to boulanger rather wilson merely lack knowledge of

318	318	199012.json	 thus although evans 's description of woodward be not completely accurate the sum of -11- the reliability factor lead we to conclude that the court do not err in admit evans 's show up identification of woodward furthermore even if the court do err in admit the show up identification the error be harmless give the abundance of other evidence confirm woodward 's guilt moreover other factor weigh in favor of reliability evans also be very certain about his identification if the court find that the technique be improper it must consider whether under the totality of the circumstance the identification itself be reliable despite the suggestive procedure evans 's physical description of the four individual as least as relay at the suppression hearing admittedly 2at the suppression hearing evans testify that woodward do have a hooded sweatshirt on with the hood up on his head during part of the encounter but this information be apparently not in agent cronin 's report of evans 's original description at approximately 2:25 p.m. evans confirm that meola who be present in handcuff and escort by police officer into the middle of the street be one of the individual present at the hometown buffet woodward 's reliance on dispensa be misplace because there the court hold only that base on the particular fact before it the lack of accuracy in the witness 's prior description be by far the great indication that the out of court identification be not reliable in addition despite the fact that evans mistook the red car which be a dodge stratus for an oldsmobile he report five of the six digit on its license plate and he also correctly identify the black car as a mustang gt indicia of reliability include the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime the witness degree of attention the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal the level of certainty demonstrate at the confrontation and the time between the crime and the confrontation furthermore the discrepancy in evans 's description be not sufficient to taint the overall reliability of the identification 1991 in the practical application of this standard court have find error to be harmless when the untainted evidence stand alone provide overwhelming evidence of the defendant 's guilt in short the court 's finding that king cause bodily injury during the commission of the robbery be not clearly erroneous as the district court note woodward be likely wear a hooded sweatshirt similar to those evans specifically report see on two of the other participants,2 which would have obscure evans 's view of the length of the hair on the back of woodward 's head which evans correctly describe as blond woodward contend that the accuracy of the prior description be the most important factor in assess reliability and that the discrepancy here be therefore of great significance rely on dispensa v. lynaugh 847 f.2d 211 5th cir although woodward contend that the incident at the hometown buffet happen very quickly prevent evans from have a 3 at the hearing little information be elicit from agent cronin as to the detailed description of each of the four individual that evans supposedly give she at the hometown buffet 1991 only description witness apparently give of suspect be that he be a black man and when a witness provide no physical description of the suspect prior to the identification see united states v. watson 76 f.3d 4 7 n.1 1st cir although the admissibility of a witness identification be a mixed question of law and fact for the purpose of argument -6- only we indulge woodward 's argument that the district court 's determination should be review de novo finally woodward point out that although evans testify at the suppression hearing that four man arrive at the hometown buffet in the oldsmobile and agent cronin confirm that he have so state at the scene a peabody police officer testify that evans tell he he see three man exit the oldsmobile but the fourth be wait in the red vehicle because we conclude that the court do not err in any of the respect allege by defendant we affirm the conviction and sentence because the car in front of he be in close proximity to the four suspect evans have a good opportunity to observe the four man and his level of attention be heighten by their action matthew s. robinowitz by appointment of the court for appellant woodward when pull onto the street evans see the red car he have see at the restaurant and at approximately 1:20 p.m. evans identify remington as he stand on the sidewalk and then king also stand on the sidewalk with police furthermore the medical record in evidence assert that the teller be diagnose with cervical strain and a 4 although the presentence report indicate that the teller have be strike with a gun the district court do not believe that a gun have be use but find that king have push she to the ground and cause her injury finally although the peabody officer testify differently evans 's statement that he observe four man in the gray oldsmobile as it pull into the parking lot be substantiate by agent cronin 's report background a fleet bank in peabody massachusetts be rob at gunpoint on the morning of june 23 1998 at approximately 11:30 a.m. a few minute later truck driver gary evans observe four darkly dress man two of whom be transfer leather bag from one car to another in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant here the court rely on fact contain in the presentence report see united states v. skrodzki 9 f.3d 198 202 1st cir the front seat passenger of the oldsmobile then get out and show evans that he be carry a gun before leave the scene in the red car with the fourth individual finally the time between evans 's observation of the four man and his show up identification of remington and king be only about two hour and of woodward and meola approximately three hour james p. duggan by appointment of the court for appellant king finally evans identify woodward who be also escort into the street in handcuff by police evans anger yell at the car 's driver as the car race around he and pull to a stop in front of he near a park black mustang bt and a red vehicle -9- contain less detail than be ideal.3 nevertheless this court have uphold the admission of identification even when the original description contain minimal physical detail see allen v. massachusetts 926 f.2d 74 81 1st cir when first interview at the hometown buffet evans describe -7- woodward as have a blond crew cut although evans apparently have long blond hair at the back of his head and the hair at the front of his head be describe by agent cronin as brown even if we conclude that error occur however the jury 's judgment remain intact if a review of the entire record persuade we that the error be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt â§ 2b3.1(b)(3)(a base on the bodily injury sustain by a bank teller who be push to the ground by king during the -12- commission of the robbery woodward also emphasize that evans describe meola as dark- skin although agent cronin testify that she would not characterize he as such and that evans misidentifie the make of the red car defendants patrick king and jay woodward appeal their bank robbery conviction arguing inter alia that witness identification of they should have be exclude from evidence at trial and that the court err by enhance their sentence base on the bodily injury cause to a teller he interrupt agent cronin 's explanation of the show up process to exclaim that he could identify remington who be stand on the sidewalk and he testify that the moment he see woodward as woodward walk between two car towards he he be positive that he recognize he -10- good opportunity to observe the suspect he admit that evans 's degree of attention be very high we thus turn to the reliability prong of the analysis woodward file a motion seek to suppress evans 's identification of he on the ground that it be so suggestive and unreliable that its admission into evidence would violate his due process rights.1 the district court agree that the identification be impermissibly suggestive but hold that it be sufficiently reliable to be admit find no error in the court 's admission of the identification and no merit in defendant other contention we affirm the street be block off multiple police car be present and bystander be try to observe the situation cooperate defendant meola testify that all four defendant meet several time during the week before the robbery to plan it that woodward have help to count the steal fund and that he help to hide the money before surrender to police see also manson v. braithwaite 432 u.s. 98 114 1977 r]eliability be the linchpin in determine the admissibility of identification testimony both appellant also challenge the court 's finding that bodily injury be cause to a teller during the robbery and make various claim regard the court 's instruction to the jury and its sentencing determination on the way to alice avenue evans be tell by cronin that police believe they have apprehend the remain two individual and that evans need to identify they if he could evans proceed to park his truck to make -3- his delivery and observe two man exit the car and load leather bag from the gray oldsmobile into the trunk of the mustang before speed off in the mustang even though woodward be already in custody and could easily have be take to the police station for a line up identification he be single out in handcuff to evans who have see the other individual he identify be arrest and who have be tell by police that they believe they have apprehend the remain robber

to come from this court 's language in pratt where we note as a general rule a prisoner who have both the incentive 7 other circuit have create at least two other exception 1 where the early petition be reject for failure to pay a filing fee or for error of form and 2 where the early petition be mislabele as a â§ 2255 but be really a â§ 2241 petition challenge the execution but not the validity of the sentence significantly for our purpose the court also say refer to the jones decision we there note that under the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantee of the sixth amendment any fact other than prior conviction that increase the maximum penalty for a crime must be charge in an indictment submit to a jury and prove beyond a reasonable doubt the supreme court however hold in jones v. united states 526 u.s. 227 251 52 1999 that the serious bodily injury requirement in 18 u.s.c. may 23 2000 the court vacate a â§ 2119(2 sentence and remand for re sentencing accord to the sentencing provision of â§ 2119(1 but it note that it be compel to 16 we be aware of two other court that arguably take a different view but one case be decide before neder and the other do not discuss it sustache naturally now want to raise the claim that his sentence should be vacate because the judge not the jury determine the serious bodily injury element 1999 where we hold that as a general matter if a petition fall under the modify re judicata rule know as the abuse of the writ doctrine because for example it raise a claim that could have be properly raise and decide in a previous â§ 2255 petition it also fall within the definition of second or successive but we think supreme court precedent make it clear that the error at sustache 's trial be not structural error.15 in neder v. united states 527 u.s. 1 1999 the court hold that the omission of an element of a criminal offense from a jury instruction be not structural error and be therefore subject to harmless error analysis â§ 2255 either as a first petition or by permission of this court as a second or successive petition or a petition fall within the section 's saving clause.3 congress impose a number of bar to federal 3 the procedural posture in which the question come to we be dictate by aedpa the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pub if post apprendi the jones claim be a constitutional claim there be less reason to resort to the saving clause as congress permit new constitutional rule claim to be make on second or successive petition provide that the supreme court have make the new rule retroactive and the claim be not previously available substantively if this be a first petition he could raise a claim that his sentence be impose in violation of the law of the united states 2000 hold that a jones error as claim here be not in the special category of forfeited error that can be correct regardless of their 15 the court in apprendi merely remand the case for far proceed not inconsistent with the opinion -28- for these reason we deny the certificate of appealability under â§ 2255 conclude that whether or not the saving clause of â§ 2255 apply there be no prejudice and dismiss the case 1996 3 where the early petition terminate without a judgment on the merit see pratt v. united states 129 f.3d 54 60 1st cir bousley have file a first â§ 2255 petition seek to benefit from bailey v. united states 516 u.s. 137 1995 a decision that narrow the definition of use in 18 u.s.c. â§ 924(c)(1 see bailey 516 u.s. at 150 four circuit have now establish some standard spare to be sure guide the application of â§ 2255 's saving clause yet from this language it do not follow that a prisoner who lack the incentive or ability to raise a particular claim in his first petition and so decline to assert it necessarily may raise it the second time around the gist of sustache 's position.8 a similar argument for sustache 's position might be construct from our decision in united states v. barrett 178 f.3d 34 1st cir 1997 or 4 where the later petition attack a different criminal judgment such as where a prisoner who have successfully bring a first habeas claim be retry reconvict and resentence and then attack the new judgment see pratt 129 f.3d at 62 see also shepeck v. united states 150 f.3d 800 801 7th cir â§â§ 2255 2244(a in any event although we think the argument questionable we do not decide the issue but only note that the premise of sustache 's argument that he lack reasonable opportunity to argue that serious bodily injury be an element of the crime be itself a difficult question.9 more significantly as we 9 this cause question be complicated and we need not decide it apprendi involve a direct appeal from a state

the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pub -7- we also consider whether assume sustache 's petition should be treat as a second or successive â§ 2255 petition his petition meet the requirement for such petition in light of the supreme court 's recent decision in apprendi v. new jersey no â§ 2119(2 the subsection that allow a long sentence if the carjack result in serious bodily

narrow the definition of use of a firearm in 18 u.s.c. the saving clause have most often be use as a vehicle to present an argument that under a supreme court decision overrule the circuit court as to the meaning of a statute,13 a prisoner be not guilty within the new meaning yet the â§ 2255 saving clause which have be interpret to avoid constitutional question about â§ 2255 must mean something in response sustache argue that he have suffer prejudice in that a judge not a jury decide the serious bodily injury issue on the evidence present there be no plausible theory that the failure to submit the question of serious bodily injury -26- to the jury have substantial and injurious effect or that sustache do not receive a fair trial on this point 8 moreover the language in pratt occur in the context of a petition bring after the prisoner have successfully bring an initial petition and be retry reconvict and resentence accordingly in perez montanez a case apply jones on direct appeal where the jones argument have not be make at trial we apply plain error analysis and reject the defendant 's claim that he be entitle to re- sentencing.16 see perez montanez 202 f.3d at 441 43 if a later

324	324	199021.json	 to be sure the record contain some evidence which view favorably to the appellant might suggest a lack of guilty knowledge e.g. the fact that the phony i-94 form be not carry separately by he but instead have be insert in his passport in this instance the jury reasonably could consider the stark contrast between the mechanic of the appellant 's original procurement of a social security card and his later venture as a red flag include for example the globe agency 's request that he leave his passport and the van ride to a remote locale along with other alien to process an ostensibly routine application first he challenge the sufficiency of the evidence where as here such a motion be premise on a claim of evidentiary insufficiency it will necessarily fail if the proof view in the manner most congenial to the government 's theory of the case allow a rational jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on march 24 1998 the appellant a nineteen year old citizen of india enter the united states on a tourist visa upon arrival he sign the pre prepared application which among other thing indicate that he be a legal alien allow to work present the phony document to amy gauvreau a clerk at the local social security office and seek the issuance of a work permit social security card moreover the jury have before it evidence of a furtive course of conduct e.g. the appellant 's payment of a substantial fee and his travel to a place with which he have no apparent connection to apply for a card that be readily available elsewhere and evidence that the document flatly contradict the limitation contain in the appellant 's visa the district court over the appellant 's timely objection give a willful blindness instruction assert that the evidence as a whole fail to establish guilty knowledge the appellant move for a judgment of acquittal see united states v. the executive legislative or judicial branch of the government of the united states knowingly and willfullyâ€ a willful blindness instruction be justify when the defendant claim to lack guilty knowledge yet the evidence take in the light most favorable to the government suffice to support an inference that he deliberately shut his eye to the true fact first that the defendant be aware of a high probability that the fact exist in this case the appellant do not fault the language of the -10- instruction.4 hence we concentrate our attention on the substantive aspect of the test a representative of the agency hand over his passport a counterfeit i-94 form and a complete application for a social security card that link the appellant to an unfamiliar mailing address in nashua new hampshire we conclude therefore that the appellant be fairly try and lawfully convict finally the jury could consider the timing of these event for the appellant know or so the jury could have find that his visa have long since expire -7- than the state of the appellant 's knowledge nonetheless support an inference that the fraudulent nature of the documentation come as no surprise to the appellant on september 17 he go to the wilmington branch office of the social security administration accompany by an aunt sign an application indicate that he be a legal alien not allow to work and procure a social security card that consistent with his visa and his b2 classification prohibit he from gainful employment we start with the appellant 's argument as it pertain to the counterfeit i-94 form and the consequent violation of section 1546(a).2 while there be no direct evidence that the appellant know that the globe agency have supply he with an apocryphal document the circumstance strongly suggest that he go there for that very purpose although the appellant do not testify at trial the defense present evidence design to show that the appellant lack guilty knowledge the scheme backfire however because gauvreau become suspicious and call ins agent to the scene finally the defense note that the fake i-94 form have be -5- tuck into the appellant 's passport and intimate that the globe agency have insert it there without his knowledge the transcript make manifest by counsel 's opening statement his choice of witness his cross examination his motion for judgment of acquittal and his summation that the appellant premise his defense largely on the government 's failure to prove guilty knowledge on this record we can not say that the jury be bar from conclude as it apparently do that the appellant purposefully approach the globe agency and that he know enough to discern the obvious difference in respect to his work status between his first social security application and the one he submit in new hampshire after review the brief and the record with care we be fully persuade that the low court do not go astray either in deny the appellant 's motion for judgment of acquittal or in charge the jury on march 11 1999 he repair to the globe agency in brooklyn new york pay that firm $ 300 and leave his passport -4- the appellant then enter a van supply by the globe agency and be transport along with several other alien to a social security branch office in new hampshire the district court deny the motion and the jury return guilty verdict on both count in his view the evidence suggest that he stumble upon the globe agency and unwittingly purchase bogus document unaware that they falsely portray he as a legal alien allow to work second he protest the district court 's decision to instruct the jury on willful blindness on this record infer the appellant 's guilty knowledge from the available circumstantial evidence fall well within the scope of the jury 's authority to evaluate the proof and determine its impact background we elucidate the relevant fact in the light most favorable to the government consistent with record support the district court subsequently impose a six month home confinement sentence levy a $ 250 special assessment and place the appellant on probation for two year but at this stage of the proceeding the evidence must be view from a prosecution friendly vantage point here

326	326	199023.json	 moreover the supreme court say recently in neder v. united states 527 u.s. 1 20 1999 that none of the fraud statute define the phrase scheme or artifice to defraud see prosser supra â§ 107 at 741 it be well settle that intent to accomplish an ultimate purpose as to benefit the speaker or to cause harm to the one address be of no importance except to punitive damage 2 addison supra â§ 1174 at 404 i]t be not necessary to prove that the false representation be make from a corrupt motive of gain to the defendant or a wicked motive of injury to the plaintiff we now hold that contrary to the defendant argument and the early holding of the panel intent to harm be not an element of bank fraud the last of these be the large check number 182 in the amount of $ 6,780.42 be present for payment and pay on march 17 1988 but there be insufficient fund in the dgb account to cover it until january 6 1989 nevertheless a juror who fail to grasp the subtlety of the explanation might easily believe that a defendant could not be convict of bank fraud unless his desire be to injure the bank rather than to enrich himself and thereby mistakenly acquit a defendant who clearly have an intent to harm in the broad sense define by the panel i.e. frustrating the bank 's right to control the disposition of its asset -28- the evidence especially chung lee 's testimony,14 be sufficient to allow the jury to find that there be such a secret agreement.15 like the stackpole street mortgage then the emerson street mortgage be part of a scheme in which ober deceptively take wcb 's fund and place wcb at risk of loss for his personal benefit the panel 's answer that proof of intent to harm be require be base on precedent from other circuit and an interpretation of the opinion of the supreme court in mcnally v. united states 483 u.s. 350 1987 a case in which the supreme court hold that the mail fraud statute do not reach honest service fraud.4 by its term however mcnally do not require proof of intent to harm as an element of bank fraud and there be no supreme court precedent that define the intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction furthermore although not necessary for conviction as we discuss below in connection with count 4 the jury could have find base on the size of the loan the location of the property outside wcb 's usual lending area the speculative nature of the condominium conversion flynn 's lack of history of business with wcb and the fact that ober 's interest in the loan violate massachusetts banking law that wcb would not have make the loan if all the material fact have be reveal the neder court address the question of whether materiality be an element of a scheme to defraud under the mail wire and bank fraud statute in short the evidence on these count like the evidence on count 4 and 5 suggest that ober treat wcb as his personal piggy bank the asset of which he feel free to dispose of by loan to himself his associate or their designee on the face of the statute â§ 1344(2 provide an alternative to not a definition of a scheme or artifice to defraud in violation of â§ 1344(1 -16- consideration of the intent issue the en banc court include the panel member arrive at a different conclusion about the meaning of intent to defraud on december 11 1987 the amount of the demand loan be increase to $ 25,000 view the record in the light most favorable to the government there be ample evidence to convict ober of bank fraud in connection with the 222 stackpole street transaction.10 the jury could have find that ober be flynn 's partner in purchase 222 stackpole street;11 that he conceal his interest by inter alia cause flynn to submit a loan application to wcb that falsely list she as sole owner that wcb make a $ 900,000 loan to finance the purchase without approval of the board of directors and that someone falsify the board minute 10 in the midst of his argument that the evidence on count 5 be insufficient ober contend that the district court err in admit allegedly unreliable wcb document the scheme must involve material falsehood see neder 525 u.s. at 25 and the defendant must have act with an intent to defraud the bank see brandon 17 f.3d at 425 which as we have explain be an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property the benefit to ober from emerson street be only indirect he fraudulently obtain the money in the form of a loan to the lees not to himself and he make no money from that transaction in isolation three member of the board however testify that the loan be never present to they for a vote and that ober never disclose to they his interest in the property the court permit ober 's attorney who have already cros examined hastings to begin recross with instruction that it be limit to the scope of the government 's cross examination in review this challenge we ask whether after view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution any rational trier of fact could have find the essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt â§ 1344 which provide whoever knowingly execute or attempt to execute a scheme or artifice-- 1 to defraud a financial institution or 2 to obtain any of the money fund credit asset security or other property own by or under the custody or control of a financial institution by mean of 2this argument be raise more clearly before the panel by kenrick than by ober but ober have join in it in his supplemental brief before the en banc court although there be testimony that some bank employee and possibly some member of the board of directors know of the interest of ober and gates in dgb three director testify that ober do not disclose the demand loan to the board the property be convert to condominium and seventeen of the eighteen unit sell quickly allow flynn to pay off the wcb loan in eight month possibly contemplate the tax advantage of a sale before the end of 1986 however kenrick decide to sell the apartment building moreover the intent to harm formulation of the panel contain an ambiguity that could not be dispel easily.5 in arrive at our formulation of the intent necessary for a bank fraud conviction we begin with the language of the bank fraud statute the use of the word defraud raise a presumption that congress intend to incorporate the common law meaning of the term fraud in the mail fraud wire fraud and bank fraud statute 1999 adequately convey the essence of the intent element after kenrick meet with ober to negotiate the stackpole street sale however the refinancing be approve with the commitment letter date october 22 1986 the application be then review by two member of the security committee a subcommittee of the board of directors who set a value for the property typically by visit it themselves without an outside appraisal apply our holding to the jury charge in this case we conclude that the instruction read as a whole see united states v. robbio 186 f.3d 37 42 1st cir 1992 derek ober be the president of the wakefield cooperative bank wcb or the bank in wakefield massachusetts

which both side now assume to govern the question and that in any event it be error to find that gray have not satisfy the requirement new hampshire law on the privilege in question an issue for de novo review be not a model of clarity and while the failure to satisfy finding would be reverse only for clear error or abuse of discretion we have some initial sympathy for gray 's claim that he do all he could to satisfy -18- the requirement of exhaust other mean during discovery the defendant produce a transcript of trento 's interview with barry zorthian a former senior vice president at gray and company as the source of this statement the problem for gray be that however the matter stand at the time of the privilege ruling the jury return a verdict as to statement g that rest on two alternative ground one be lack of actual malice but the other be gray 's failure in the jury 's view to prove that the statement be false and defamatory the record also show that gray be a central figure in this controversy be identify as one of the well know of the high level washington public relation expert an emblematic figure and a self profess defender against attack on lobby on march 5

that this be so and where the underlie fact be disclose it become even -12- more clear that the writer or publisher be merely speculate if so about the inference under state law defendant in this case would be liable for damage for libel if as a result of the failure to exercise reasonable care they publish false and defamatory fact about the plaintiff to a third party assume that no valid privilege apply the test admittedly a very crude one be whether the statement be properly understand as purely speculation or alternatively imply that the speaker or writer have concrete fact that confirm or underpin the truth of the speculation gray who have not independently attack the jury 's alternative ground have not provide any very cogent answer to this claim beyond say rather tersely that if the privilege have be overridden trento have still baulk and the jury been tell that therefore it could presume that the source do not exist then the jury might have think the statement false at the other extreme where there be two production of phantom of the opera and the defendant call one of they fake and phony this court hold that the adjective be subjective aesthetic judgment protect as opinion the latter judgment where the product be an intangible service like lobby and criterion for success be debatable be surely one of opinion so we direct our attention to the charge that gray

we think that the statement be germane to the controversy over lobbying and the record show numerous article concern gray his company and hill and knowlton publish between 1986 and 1992 -15- the defendant assert and the plaintiff do not dispute that actual malice in this case must be show separately as to each defendant however the supreme court have read the first amendment make bind on the

trial be persuade that virginia law apply to this case thomson 119 n.h. at 373 to be defamatory a statement must tend to lower the plaintiff in the esteem of any substantial and respectable group even

public figure may be one of such fame as to be so in all context e.g. the president or a limited purpose public figure as to a particular episode or subject in the latter case only the statement about the person in that context require a showing of actual malice on may 19 1999 the district court rule that gray be a limited purpose public figure require gray to show actual malice in order to prevail

67 n.7.3 in most case as in this one the plaintiff do not have any evidence of actual malice in the literal sense but as already note recklessness suffice 1969 and thus one we would review de novo but the factfinder must ultimately decide whether a statement like the one here reasonably capable of both a defamatory and non defamatory meaning be in fact understand as defamatory by its recipients.2 we think that the statement 's implication of spy on client be capable of bear a defamatory meaning it could easily harm gray in deal with client and that a reasonable jury could have find the statement in question defamatory there be various vantage from which the statement could be attack as false e.g. that no such view be express by the unnamed executive but the bite here be in the claim that closeness be fake and gray 's position be that he could show at trial that he be quite close to president reagan and other senior official and be not fake these relationship rather the case be likely to protect a statement as opinion where it involve expression of personal judgment especially as the judgment become more vague and subjective in character he found his own firm in 1981 sell it to hill and knowlton in 1986 and serve for a period as a member of the board of director and chairman of a division of the latter pertinently the court have hold that a public figure may recover only if the false and defamatory statement be make with actual malice mean in the supreme court 's non- literal usage either that defendant know that the statement be false or show a reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity the next statement designate h read as follow robert crowley believe that casey may have ask gray to take on these controversial client for the very purpose of spy on they probably falsity harte hanks communs inc. v. connaughton 491 u.s. 657 688 1989 quote garrison v. louisiana 379 u.s. 64 74 1964 but mere negligence in conduct an investigation or weigh the evidence be not enough recklessness in this context can be show by prove that the defendant actually have a high degree of awareness of p. 15(a gray have the book for six year before he move to amend and at the outset of the litigation could have easily decide which charge he believe to be false the last statement of the four statement dispose of before trial statement c)--quote a former gray and company

assault by its employee when the assault arise out of an employment relate dispute and the assault occur within work relate limit of time and place regardless of whether the employee have a purpose to serve the employer.1 nichols 's argument be plainly incompatible with the restatement rule nichols cite case from a number of jurisdiction hold that an assault can be within the scope of employment if

use of the sexual assault if prove as the cornerstone of the envision departure in this instance the magnitude of the departure stand alone be unremarkable â§ 3661 1994 no limitation shall be place on the information concern the background character and conduct of a person convict of an offense which a court of the united states may receive and consider for the purpose of impose an appropriate sentence so it be here although the guideline applicable to the offense of conviction be section 2g2.4 the possession guideline not section 2g2.2 the trafficking guideline see amirault 173 f.3d at 35 the district court be entitle to examine factor set out in section 2g2.2(b in order to evaluate the appropriateness of a departure to far this argument he note that the sentencing guideline themselves contain time limit on the use of past conviction see ussg â§4a1.2(e and cite case that question the propriety in particular circumstance of base sentence enhancement on unrelated remote conviction see e.g. united states v. aymelek 926 f.2d 64 73 1st cir iv the appellant far contend that even if the district court have an appropriate factually acceptable basis for depart upward the extent of the departure be excessive yet as the sentencing guideline and the case recognize the appropriateness of a temporal limit depend heavily on the circumstance of the particular case n.1 explain that the term p]attern of activity involve the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor as use in section 2g2.2(b)(4 mean any combination of two or more separate instance of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor by the defendant whether or not the abuse or exploitation a occur during the course of the offense b involve the same or different victim or c result in a conviction for such conduct in this case the district court do not rest its decision on a determination that the sexual assault be relevant conduct but rather conclude that the act warrant an upward departure under section 5k2.0 thus to the extent that the sentence impose on the appellant inflict a harsh punishment it do so not with respect to the early sexual assault but rather with respect to his current crime the possession of child pornography in do so the court draw an analogy to ussg â§2g2.2 the guideline that deal with trafficking in material involve the sexual exploitation of a minor the law or a judicial decree violate the ex post facto clause if it change the punishment and inflict a great punishment than the law annex to the crime when -13- commit the sexual assault that the sentencing court find the appellant have commit be part of a pattern of sexual exploitation of the minor sister in law that include inter alia the taking of approximately forty nude photograph and their retention in his child pornography collection for his sexual gratification finally the appellant maintain that if the sentencing guideline allow consideration of the sexual assault their application violate due process the court find add support for the occurrence of the sexual assault in the appellant 's taking and retention of the nude photograph of his sister in law and credit the suggestion that the victim fail to speak out early due to fear shame and mortification despite the protract length of time that pass between the sexual assault and the appellant 's commission of the child pornography offense the due process clause furnish no basis for prohibit a sentencing court from assess the impact of the early conduct en route to determine the appropriateness vel non of an upward departure.3 vi 3although the appellant phrase this argument in term of the sentencing guideline we note that the adoption of the guideline do not materially alter a sentencing court 's historic discretion to consider the full information possible concern the defendant 's life and characteristic 1999 our waiver doctrine do not require that a defendant in order to preserve his right on appeal raise every objection that might have be relevant if the district court have not already reject the defendant 's argument 1996 explain that a sentencing court may consider as relevant conduct act that be not within the court 's jurisdiction to try from the appellant 's standpoint however this be a pyrrhic victory see gryger v. burke 334 u.s. 728 732 1948 reason to this effect in hold that an habitual offender statute do not violate the ex post facto clause united states v. regan 989 f.2d 44 48 1st cir this thesis rest on the premise that the assault happen many year before the offense of conviction and thus be not relevant conduct under ussg â§1b1.3 he marry this attack to an attack on the reliability of his suppose admission to the police note that the report statement be neither record nor submit to he for signature and in all event be make in the immediate aftermath of the turmoil engender by his arrest the court fortify this explanation by a further analogy to ussg â§2a3.1 cover criminal sexual abuse which if directly applicable i would have dictate an offense level of twenty seven â€ six level high than that calculate for the appellant even after take the upward departure into account â€ and ii would have yield a sentencing range of seventy to eighty seven month for example even though the sentencing guideline generally restrict the use of date conviction they do allow the sentencing court leeway to consider such conviction if they provide evidence of similar or serious dissimilar criminal conduct in all event the charge comprise rank conjecture wholly unsupported by the record the most pertinent guideline commentary teach with an exception that have no bearing here that i]f the defendant engage in the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor at any time whether or not such abuse or exploitation occur during the course of the offense or result in a conviction for such conduct view in the abstract these counter argument present a plausible although not inevitable scenario different from -9- that discern by the district court in the case at hand the low court premise its upward departure on a finding that the appellant have sexually assault two of his sister in law during their minority 386 390 1798 even if as the appellant contend the snapshot be not sexually explicit under 18 u.s.c. it follow inexorably that there be no legal error in the low court 's determination that the sexual assault although occur long ago nevertheless could bear the weight of an upward departure under section 5k2.0 at resentence the district court correct its original error depart upward under ussg â§5k2.0 and impose a forty six month incarcerative term.1 amirault appeal anew this time contest the upward departure because the record adequately support the court 's version of the controvert event its rejection of the appellant 's subsequent disavowal can not be clearly erroneous if so we must probe 1the court appropriately employ the 1998 edition of the united states sentencing guidelines ii we deal expeditiously with the appellant 's thesis that even if the sexual assault occur they can not support an upward departure not surprisingly therefore upward departure be allow for act of misconduct not result in conviction as long as those act whether or not relevant conduct in the section 1b1.3 sense relate meaningfully to the -6- offense of conviction because the retain photograph link the appellant 's conduct during the offense of conviction to the early assault the assault constitute an allowable ground on which to premise an upward departure this be especially so because the appellant 's position hinge on question of credibility and such question be uniquely within the competence of the sentencing court see e.g. united states v. rostoff 53 f.3d 398 411 1st cir see e.g. united states v. ortiz santiago 211 f.3d 146 151 1st cir witte v. united states 515 u.s. 389 401 1995 the appellant contest each of the element of the dethlefs inquiry he posit that the upward departure even if otherwise unimpugnable violate his right under the ex post facto clause and the due process clause the sentencing court reject those argument choose instead to credit the detailed account contain in the victim impact statement and to take the appellant 's initial admission of inappropriate contact at face value 99 2342 united states of america appellee v. alan lee amirault defendant appellant see united states v. watts 519 u.s. 148 157 1997 per curiam united states v. rodriguez 112 f.3d 26 31 1st cir the appellant be

advice regard the economic or business aspect of these activity the tax court find that although petitioner read horse publication attend horse breeding seminar and use professional trainer veterinarian horse farm breeder auctioneer and jockey he do not prove that he possess the requisite expertise regard the business end of the activity or that he rely on the advice of other who possess that type of expertise the tax court carefully consider this argument cite the testimony of petitioner 's expert which indicate that three to five percent of those in the horse racing and breeding business make about $ 775 million a year to this end petitioner by his own account be one of the pioneer in use nutrition and vitamin supplement as part of the diet for his stable of horse specifically the tax court determine that 1 petitioner do not use financial projection accounting record or budget to control expense and he never make any significant change in the way he operate the activity despite recurrent loss 2 petitioner and his advisor have expertise in the mechanic of horse racing but not in the economic aspect of this activity 3 petitioner devote time to horse racing and breeding but he fail to demonstrate that it be enough time to generate a profit 4 petitioner fail to prove that the value of his horse might increase enough to offset the loss he -14- have incur 5 petitioner 's financial success with westfield gage be not relevant because it be not indicative of petitioner 's ability to run a profitable horse racing business 6 petitioner incur enormous loss total more than $ 6 million over thirty seven year 7 petitioner 's horse racing and breeding activity never generate a profit 8) petitioner be use his substantial income from westfield gage to finance his horse race activity and finally 9 while petitioner do not ride the horse he obviously enjoy own the horse or he would have abandon the activity long ago in the face of enormous and continuous loss the court acknowledge however that between 1955 and 1993 petitioner increase the size of his herd and change his breeding practice twice the proceedings before the tax court on april 24 1996 the commissioner send a notice of deficiency to petitioner state that their federal income tax return be deficient in the amount of $ 194,121 and $ 133,807 for 1992 and 1993 respectively to the contrary the court 's finding be amply support by the record and invariably lead to the conclusion that petitioner 's horse racing and breeding activity be not engage in for profit kuta prepare index card on most of petitioner 's horse from around 1956 through the time of the trial which show the name of the horse its year of birth its sire and dam when petitioner acquire it and from whom the purchase price when petitioner dispose of the -7- horse and the name of the party acquire the horse petitioner do not however keep record regard the performance or race result of the trainer thus while hendricks indicate that he generally expect his land to appreciate in value such a notion without any probative foundation be not enough to support a profit motive and in particular a contention that the appreciation could be anticipate to be sufficient to recoup petitioner 's farming loss regard the sale and purchase of horse petitioner rely on veterinarian breeder professional trainer and auctioneer the tax court determine that the sheer magnitude of petitioner 's loss the consistency with which they be incur and -15- their steady and dramatic increase over an extended period of time provide compelling evidence that petitioner be not engage in horse racing and breeding for the primary purpose of earn a profit likewise we find factor four the likelihood of asset appreciation and factor seven the amount of occasional profit equally persuasive the spreadsheet be usually prepare at the end of the year from information in the check register and be use both to monitor expense and for tax return preparation in our view the tax court reasonably determine that of the nine relevant factor seven weigh against -21- petitioner two be neutral and none weigh in favor of petitioner

can be use for the purpose of cut expense increase profit and evaluate the overall performance of a business on an -19- ongoing basis for the reason state below we affirm the decision of the tax court in addition petitioner testify that if westfield gage be lose money he would have seek advice on how to turn the business around he assert however that his profit motive may be infer from the speculative nature of the horse business 1986 and their application depend on the fact present by the individual case see treas as the tax court correctly observe petitioner never even come close to realize a profit during the thirty seven year that he pursue horse racing and breeding and his total loss for that period exceed $ 6 million on july 22 1996 petitioner file a timely petition in the united states tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency and penalty however when the corporation be have financial difficulty westfield gage 's treasurer eugene kida prepared budget the

the horse racing and breeding activity and part of this time be spend gather information for petitioner 's tax return our conclusion regard petitioner 's record in addition to petitioner 's failure to introduce any evidence favorably compare his activity to a profitable horse racing and breeding operation lead we to conclude that the weight of the evidence support the tax court 's ruling that factor one favor the commissioner in hendricks the court state t]he mere expectation that land value may appreciate be not sufficient in itself to demonstrate that an activity be engage in for profit

point see i d. section 2x3.1 of the guidelines provide that for the crime of act as an accessory after the fact the defendant 's base offense level should be â€ś6 level low than the offense level for the underlie offense but in no event less than 4 or more than 30.â€ť even so â€śwhere the defendant 's conduct be limit to harbor a fugitive â€ť the guidelines indicate that the offense level â€śshall not be more than level 20.â€ť id. application note 3 â€śthe defendant have the burden of prove her entitlement to an acceptance of responsibility credit and the sentencing court 's determination to withhold the reduction will be overturn only if it be clearly erroneous.â€ť united states v. ocasio rivera 991 f.2d 1 4 1st cir conclusion for the foregoing reason we affirm the defendant 's sentence but then when vega meet with the united states probation office shortly before sentencing she again try to suggest that several day have pass after the robbery before she learn that the other not just ramos have be involve here -5- although the district court apply the six level adjustment that u.s.s.g. with this standard of review in mind we turn to the merit against this background the district court be entitle to find that vega have help the other defendant in way that be not â€ślimite to harbor a fugitive.â€ť id. the district court choose not to exercise that discretion because in its view vega 's family circumstance be not sufficiently unusual to justify a reduce sentence after determine the guideline 's scope and meaning we review the district court 's factual determination for clear error giv[e due deference to the district court 's application of the guideline to the fact although vega disagree we be not empower to second guess the district court in this regard to receive this adjustment the defendant must show that she be â€śless -8- culpable than most other participantsâ€ť in the offense of conviction 1997 â€śit be within the discretion of the district court to deny a reduction on the basis of its determination that a defendant have resort to half truth or evasion from the truth in an effort to minimize his or her culpability.â€ť even if vega be less blameworthy than those who commit the robbery she be as much of an accessory after the fact as the other charge with that offense raphael baez- gonzalez and rodolfo landa rivera stahl circuit judge august 30 2000

that although there be some initial confusion about these matter the district court make sure that taylor understand the sentence he be face before finally accept the guilty plea the court but do you understand that if i find 50 or more gram of cocaine base that that be the kind of guideline not the kind a conspiracy conviction require that a defendant 's membership in the conspiracy be prove on the basis of his own word and action not on the basis of mere 4 as judge hornby note in his preface to these instruction it bear emphasis that no district judge be require to use the pattern instruction and that the court of appeals have not in any way approve the use of a particular instruction the defendant bring this appeal raise the following issue richardson gaul and taylor contend that the district court err in find that the cocaine be cocaine base and crack richardson contend that the court deny he a meaningful opportunity to challenge the government 's sentencing evidence taylor contend that the court err in deny his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and deny he a sentence reduction under the safety valve and arruda contend that the court err in its jury instruction on conspiracy craig explain in her testimony however that the sample be cocaine base not cocaine hydrochloride and the calculate as notation result from laboratory protocol that require she to use a standard of measurement base on hydrochloride when the sample contain both cocaine base and another non cocaine substance this be a correct statement of the consequence of the guilty plea and we can not say that the court err in find that taylor understand those consequence the court tell the jury that mere association do not establish membership in a conspiracy that the defendant must have willfully join the conspiracy and that the government have to prove both intent to agree and intent to -16- commit the underlie crime the court do not 3 in evaluate the plausibility of the proffered reason the district court could also have consider the fact that the motion to withdraw the plea be one of a number of dubious pro se filing by taylor section 841(b do not define cocaine base but we have hold that the term as use in the statute include all form of cocaine base include but not limit to crack arruda argue that by use the word may instead of must the district court erroneously imply that other type of evidence such as his association with the conspirator or his knowledge of their wrongdoing could be sufficient to prove that he willfully join the conspiracy that sentence be similar to but differ in one noteworthy respect from a portion of instruction 4.03 of the pattern criminal jury instructions for the district courts of the first circuit 1998)4 proof that defendant willfully join in the agreement must be base upon evidence of his her own word and/or action -2- taylor move to withdraw his guilty plea and the district court deny the motion the quoted language from the pattern instruction though not find verbatim in any of our case be a correct statement of the law the finding that the substance be cocaine base and crack in assess the challenge to the district court 's drug type finding we begin by briefly sketch the legal landscape of the cocaine base crack distinction in the sentencing context mindful that we have be over this ground -3- many time in recent year the court supportably find that taylor 's proffered reason for seek withdrawal be implausible stem more from garden- variety second thought and unhappiness with the court 's finding that the substance be over 50 gram of cocaine base which lead inexorably to the ten year mandatory minimum than from any lack of understanding at the time of the plea.3 although the court do not consider the timing of the request to be significant the fact that it be make after the trial of taylor 's codefendant mean that if withdrawal be allow the government would face the prejudice of an additional trial although his argument be difficult to understand taylor apparently argue that the district court mislead he about the consequence of his plea by tell he that he could face an enhanced sentence under the guidelines if the substance he possess be find to be cocaine base when in fact an increase sentence require an additional finding that the substance be crack and hence an additional evidentiary burden for the government the defendant insinuation notwithstanding craig make it clear that she have never find any of the sample to be cocaine hydrochloride.1 although craig may not have perform all possible test on every sample-- contrary to the defendant contention the record be unclear in this respect the mere possibility of further test go to the weight of the government 's evidence and be no reason to overturn the finding of the district court this testimony remark the substance 's distinctive appearance and texture and identify it as crack forge the final link in the evidentiary chain the district court 's denial of that request be ground in the fifth of the five safety valve criterion not later than the time of the sentencing hearing the defendant have truthfully provide to the government all information and evidence the defendant have concern the offense or offense that be part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan but the fact that the defendant have no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the government be already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant have comply with this requirement at the sentencing hearing the prosecutor represent to the court that there have be only an aborted proffer session at which taylor give an account that the government regard as absurd as use in the guidelines however cocaine base have since a 1993 amendment a narrow meaning cocaine base for the purpose of this guideline mean crack taylor nevertheless argue to the district court that he meet the safety valve criterion because apart from the aborted interview the government never request him to come in and give a truthful proffer 1995 truthfully provide all the information he possess concern the crime what count be the substance of the disclosure other factor include 1 the plausibility of the proffered reason for withdraw the plea 2 the timing of the motion to withdraw 3 whether the defendant assert his innocence and 4 whether the plea be pursuant to a plea agreement because the court do not clearly err in find -14- that taylor have not prove his entitlement to the safety valve reduction taylor be properly sentence to the mandatory minimum of ten year both the statute and the guidelines impose significantly great penalty for distribute or manufacturing dispensing or possess with intent to manufacture distribute or dispense a give quantity of cocaine base rather than an equivalent quantity of cocaine i.e. cocaine hydrochloride or powder cocaine jury instruction must be gauge in the context of the charge as a whole not in isolation the district court be also entitle to consider the utter absence of evidence that the substance be anything other than crack cocaine the fundamental question be whether or not through act and statement of his own reflect both in those act and statement and in the other evidence in this case the

base and crack although the word may create an arguable ambiguity the court 's instruction do not affirmatively suggest that proof of arruda 's join the conspiracy could be base on mere association or knowledge of wrongdoing the district court be correct to reject that argument craig give her opinion that it be crack base on the appearance of the sample and the presence in some of they of sodium

375	375	199080.json	 the majority note that at the plea hearing the government in response to the courtâ€ ™ s question estimate a sentencing guideline range that do not outstrip the ten year mandatory minimum p. 11(c)(1 provide that before accept a plea of guilty the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of and determine that the defendant understand the following 1 the nature of the charge to which the plea be offer the mandatory minimum penalty provide by law if any and the maximum possible penalty provide by law include the effect of any special parole or supervised release term the fact that the court be require to consider any applicable sentencing guideline but may depart from those guideline under some circumstance in the instant case of course the government have inform the court at the plea hearing of the quantity attribute to defendant here as to the most serious charge drug conspiracy the government state unequivocally in the plea agreement that santo face a mandatory minimum sentence of five year and a forty year maximum -24- this be not a case in which at the time of the plea the drug quantity be undetermined nor be this a case in which the judge fail altogether to advise the defendant of the applicable mandatory minimum at the rule 11 hearing the district court base its unqualified statement to santo of the statutory minimum and maximum on the drug quantity provide by the government 100 to 400 gram it be therefore readily apparent that because the guideline sentencing range at its nadir outstrip the mandatory minimum the latter have no relevance to and no actual effect upon the appellantâ€ ™ s sentence we hold therefore that the court fail to comply with the express provision of rule 11(c)(1 when it incorrectly advise santo as to the minimum and maximum penalty that apply in his case 1994 reiterate the watch dictum the conviction be reverse because the court have fail to inform the defendant of any applicable mandatory minimum sentence in hernandez- wilson the government recommend a thirty month sentence on the condition that the defendant comply with the requirement of the â€śsafety valveâ€ť provision which would permit the court to sentence he below the mandatory minimum unlike mcdonald the government calculate a sentence of 87 to 108 month at the rule 11 hearing well under the undisclosed mandatory minimum of ten year what occur controvert the purpose behind rule 11 's requirement that the district court inform a defendant of and determine that he understand the applicable mandatory minimum mandatory minimum may be relevant to the defendantâ€ ™ s expectation regardless of the guideline sentencing range that be not automatically available to the district judge at the time of the plea we will however determine compliance with rule 11 even if a claim of non compliance be not present in the district court if the record be sufficiently develop which be generally the case because of rule 11(g 's requirement that the district court make a complete record of the plea proceeding the question then be whether santo can be say to have understand the consequence of his plea give the district courtâ€ ™ s failure to call to his attention as rule 11 require the mandatory minimum that actually come to apply in his case as in mcdonald the bottom of the range â€śoutstrippedâ€ť the ten- year mandatory minimum unbeknownst to both party as well as the district court at the time the defendant enter his guilty plea the safety valve provision be not available due to the defendantâ€ ™ s criminal history hence he have no possibility of receive a sentence less than the sixty month mandatory minimum the plea agreement go on to announce that the party â€świll take the follow position at sentencing under the united states sentencing guidelinesâ€ť the party agree to take the position in connection with the drug count that santo be accountable for at least 100 gram of heroin that his base offense level be 26 100 400 gram of heroin and the five year minimum mandatory provision be applicable accordingly district judge often rely heavily although not exclusively on the prosecutor to provide the court with a description of statutory penalty or at least to advise the court if it misstate the term at the rule 11 hearing as in the write plea agreement the prosecution openly declare that santoâ€ ™ s probable guideline sentence be 87 to 108 month or approximately seven to nine year at the time of the plea mr. santo be advise that the maximum sentence he could face if he plead guilty be 40 year in prison if on the other hand a defendant at the plea colloquy be tell that -27- notwithstanding the term of his plea agreement a great minimum sentence may apply than what the agreement provide for he have no ground for complaint if the psr later state a drug quantity exceed that specify in the plea bargain there be no authority for the proposition that the district courtâ€ ™ s failure to inform a defendant that a great quantity of drug might be attribute to he at sentencing than what the government have commit to in the plea agreement bring into play high mandatory minimum constitute reversible error nor can such a requirement be read into rule 11(c)(1 that the probation department subsequently increase the drug quantity attribute to santo recommend a ten year mandatory minimum do not retroactively infect what the district court do with error inform the defendant of that be because a defendant in santoâ€ ™ s position who enter a plea in reliance on the plea agreement would have a basis for move to withdraw his plea at sentence if the psr at that point increase the drug quantity over what the government have represent in the agreement not because the court be bind by the sentence contemplate by the agreement which it be not under rule 11(e)(1)(c but because the government have establish the factual basis for the plea he contend that the district courtâ€ ™ s understatement of the statutory mandatory minimum sentence as five year rather than the ultimately applicable ten year violate rule 11(c)(1)â€ ™ s explicit requirement that the court advise the defendant of â€śthe mandatory minimum penalty provide by law if any.â€ť santo far argue that the courtâ€ ™ s error affect his substantial rights.3 see fed

prior act clause in such a situation this court have hold the duty to indemnify be -26- determine by the basis for the settlement any other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured whether such other insurance be state to be primary pro rata contributory excess contingent or otherwise unless such other insurance be write only as a specific excess insurance over the limit of liability provide in the policy.7 in contrast near the middle of st. paul 's policy under a section label when this agreement cover be st. paul 's prior act clause specify under what condition st. paul will cover claim base on act commit prior to the policy period by this point it have expend nearly $ 500,000 in defense and settlement of the case.4 after settle the home move to amend its complaint to include the allegation that because st. paul breach its duty to defend s&e st. paul now bear the burden of prove how the bruno settlement be to be apportion as between s&e 's 1989 act and its 1995 act in particular st. paul must show that the settlement be not pay entirely to compensate for s&e 's 1995 act for which the home allege st. paul be exclusively responsible under maine law or so the home argue if an insurer breach its duty to defend a suit and the suit settle then the insurer bear the burden of allocate the settlement and prove that at -29- least some of the settlement be pay for claim that its policy do not cover.11 yet the argument continue because the settlement agreement in the bruno case do not specify how the settlement be intend to be allocate st. paul 's burden of allocate the settlement be impossible to carry service and second that the home 's policy do cover the 1995 act because they sufficiently relate to the 1989 act for which the home concede coverage.8 there be two question to be decide first whether either insurer have a duty to defend as to the 1995 act and second whether either insurer have a duty to indemnify for its part the home appear to concede that under gibson supra it be oblige to defend as to the 1995 act as well as the 1989 act therefore suppose the home be correct that st. paul alone have a duty to indemnify as to the 1995 act it must be assume that the settlement be pay entirely for those act in effect render st. paul responsible for the whole settlement follow the guidance of this meagre but distinct majority the magistrate judge reason as follow the home 's other insurance clause appear after the coverage section of its policy whereas the other insurance language in st. paul 's prior act clause appear within the coverage section of its policy consequently under the home 's policy coverage for s&e 's 1989 act be initially trigger in the coverage section and only rescind if the other insurance clause later kick in while under st. paul 's policy coverage be never trigger -15- in the first place so because st. paul 's coverage be never trigger the home 's other insurance clause never kick in its coverage be never rescind and the home be leave as the primary insurer the difficulty be that such a conclusion be flatly at odd with carriers which explicitly reject the rule that as between two other insurance clause the specific trump the general at 138 and for that reason it trump the home 's other insurance clause accordingly st. paul be responsible for a pro rata share of the cost of defend and indemnify s&e as to the 1989 act allege in the bruno complaint -11- an excess clause then the first policy cover the claim and if the first be insufficient the second cover the excess as for st. paul even though the bruno suit be a claim make during its policy period st. paul initially disclaim any obligation to defend or indemnify s&e eventually it agree to provide coverage on an excess basis only in the event that the home 's coverage be exhaust third having find that st. paul have no duty to defend s&e the magistrate deny the home 's motion to amend its complaint on the ground that the amendment would be futile the bruno complaint as originally file allege only the 1989 act those act be the raison d'etre for the suit the magistrate rule first that the st. paul policy do not cover the 1995 act allege in the amend bruno complaint because the act be not commit in the 4 these expense do not exceed the home 's $ 3 million policy limit so it have never be claim that st. paul 's obligation as an excess insurer be trigger by the bruno suit st. paul respond first that its policy do not -21- cover the 1995 act because none qualify as a negligent act error or omission commit in the performance of legal -5- bruno claim be bring in 1995 the home consider the claim to be relate to the 1991 claim and so under a provision in the home 's policy require the home to treat related claim as the same claim it have to treat the bruno claim as if it have be make in 1991 during its policy period.3 the home agree to defend the bruno suit while fully reserve its right
