After carefully reviewing the  record\n                    \n\nand the  briefs of the parties, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.   We do  so essentially for  the reasons  set\n\nforth  in the  Report  and Recommendation  of the  magistrate\n\njudge  which was adopted by  the district court  in its order\n\ndated May 12, 1994.\n\n          Specifically, we agree that under the standards set\n\nforth  in  Strickland v.  Washington,  466  U.S. 668  (1984),\n                                    \n\ncounsel's choice to forego  an entrapment defense plainly was\n\nan  objectively reasonable choice, given appellant's criminal\n\nhistory and  the  evidence.   As  for the  jury  instructions\n\nconcerning  venue, we add that even if they had been reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion -- the standard of review  applicable\n\nto properly preserved objections -- appellant still would not\n\nhave  prevailed.   Under  this standard,  \"[t]he trial  court\n\nshould be  reversed only  if the  instruction was capable  of\n\nconfusing and thereby misleading the jury.\"  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nFischbach  &amp; Moore, Inc., 750 F.2d 1183, 1195 (3d Cir. 1984),\n                        \n\ncert. denied, 470 U.S. 1029 (1985).\n            \n\n          The  venue  instruction,  viewed in  light  of  all\n\nevidence,  was not  misleading.   As we  held in  appellant's\n\ndirect appeal, even had the jury accepted appellant's version\n\nof the events, the evidence of venue in Maine  was \"so clear\"\n\nthat  \"no  reasonable  juror  could  have  found  otherwise.\"\n\nUnited States v. Georgacarakos, 988 F.2d 1289, 1297 (1st Cir.\n                              \n\n1993).  Further,  when the instruction  is considered in  the\n\ncontext of  the charge as a whole, it is plain that there was\n\nno abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Doane, 975 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n8, 11 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (quoting Cupp v.  Naughten, 414  U.S.\n                                                  \n\n141,  146-47  (1973)).   Given  our  findings concerning  the\n\nadequacy  of  the  instructions  on  constructive  and  joint\n\npossession, counsel's  failure to timely object  to the venue\n\ninstruction  did  not deprive  appellant  of  \"a trial  whose\n\nresult  is  reliable.\"   See  Strickland,  466  U.S.  at 687.\n                                        \n\nTherefore, he was not prejudiced.\n\n          Because  we  affirm the  judgment  of the  district\n                             \n\ncourt, appellant's appeal of the denial of bail is moot.\n\n                             -3-\n",
