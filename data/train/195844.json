Michael  DuPont  is  appealing  the\r                                 \n\nOctober  27,  1994, and  November  23,  1994,  orders of  the\n\ndistrict court,  which basically denied his  request that the\n\ncourt file  an incomplete habeas form on  his behalf as a new\n\nhabeas action.  We affirm for the following reasons. \n\n          First,  DuPont  submitted  his  motions  under  the\n\ndocket  number of a closed  habeas case.   The district court\n\ncorrectly  concluded that  DuPont  should file  a new  habeas\n\naction. \n\n          Second, the habeas petition submitted by DuPont did\n\nnot  state  what his  grounds for  relief  were or  provide a\n\nstatement of  supporting facts in  summary form.   Rather, it\n\nattempted  to incorporate  by reference  his original  habeas\n\npetition  and his  \"traverse\" from  the closed  case.   Under\n\nthose  circumstances,  the district  court  could  reject the\n\npetition as insufficient under Rule 2(c) and could decline to\n\norder  the  clerk to  open a  new  habeas action  on DuPont's\n\nbehalf.  See Adams v. Armontrout, 897 F.2d 332, 334 (8th Cir.\r                                            \n\n1990)  (stating that  a  habeas petitioner  must state  facts\n\nshowing he is entitled to habeas relief sufficient to \"enable\n\nthe  court to determine, from the face of the petition alone,\n\nwhether the petition  merits further  habeas corpus  review,\"\n\nthe court affirmed  dismissal of a habeas  petition which did\n\nnot describe  the facts  supporting the asserted  grounds for\r\r\n\nrelief, but  simply referred  the court to  appellate briefs,\n\ntranscripts, the record, and other such materials).\n\n          Third,  although DuPont  claims  that state  prison\n\nofficials are  withholding his  original  habeas record  from\n\nhim,  he  acknowledges that  he has  received  a copy  of his\n\noriginal  habeas  petition from  the  clerk  of the  district\n\ncourt.   His  original  petition  sufficiently describes  his\n\ngrounds  for habeas relief  and facts  in support  thereof to\n\npermit  him  to  file  a  new  habeas  petition.    From  his\n\nsubmissions  here and  below,  DuPont appears  to have  ample\n\naccess to documents required to support his claim that he has\n\nexhausted his state remedies since filing his original habeas\n\naction.   The district court was not required to send him the\n\ntraverse from his original habeas action.\n\n          Fourth, the October 11 order of this court  did not\n\ndirect  the district  court to  file a  new habeas  action on\n\nDuPont's behalf.  Nor  did it direct DuPont to seek  an order\n\ncompelling prison  officials to return his habeas file to him\n\nby  applying for  such an  order in  a closed  case.   At the\n\npresent time, DuPont has the materials he needs to file a new\n\nhabeas  action.  If he  does so, and  if it becomes necessary\n\nfor DuPont to obtain  his original habeas record in  order to\n\npursue his  new habeas  action, then  he may  seek injunctive\n\nrelief  in the  new action.   Otherwise,  he  may file  a new\n\naction for injunctive  relief in the  district court for  the\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nsole  purpose  of  obtaining  the allegedly  withheld  habeas\n\nrecord.1\n\n          Finally,  in view  of the  above, we  deny DuPont's\n\nrequest that counsel be appointed to represent him.\n\n          Affirmed.  \r                               \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  We infer  from DuPont's arguments  on appeal that  he may\nhave sought a motion to compel prison officials to return his\nhabeas record to him in a civil rights  action he has brought\nagainst  prison officials in DuPont v.  Dubois, D. Mass. Dkt.\r                                                          \nNo. 92-12420.   If so,  his motion  will be acted  on in  due\ncourse.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
