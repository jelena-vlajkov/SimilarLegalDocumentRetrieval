We recount the material facts in the light\r\nmost favorable  to Thorn, Ltd.,  the party against  which summary\r\njudgment was granted.  Velez-Gomez v. SMA Life Assur. Co., 8 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n873, 874 (1st Cir. 1993). \r\n\n     2The Note is set out in the appendix.  See infra pp. i-ii. \r                                                               \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nInc.  (\"HLI\"), a  corporation partly owned  by Alletzhauser.   To\r\n\ninduce  the  transfer,  Alletzhauser  (as  guarantor),  HTRA  (as\r\n\nmaker), and Thorn, Ltd. (as subordinated lender), entered  into a\r\n\nloan  guaranty  agreement  (\"the  Guaranty\") on  July  11,  1991,\r\n\nwhereby Alletzhauser guaranteed prompt  payment of HTRA's debt to\r\n\nThorn, Ltd.  \"when and as the Subordinated Obligations become due\r\n\nand payable in accordance with their terms. . . .\"3   Pursuant to\r\n\nsection 1  of the Note and the Guaranty, on April 8, 1994, Thorn,\r\n\nLtd. demanded full  payment from Alletzhauser.   HTRA and Alletz-\r\n\nhauser declined on the ground that payment was not due.  \r\n\n          In  September 1994, Thorn,  Ltd. commenced  this action\r\n\nagainst  Alletzhauser in  federal district  court to  enforce its\r\n\nGuaranty.   Alletzhauser  denied  liability, and  asserted as  an\r\n\naffirmative defense that legal action on the Guaranty was \"prema-\r\n\nture.\"   Ultimately, the district court  entered summary judgment\r\n\nagainst Thorn, Ltd. on the ground that it had no present right to\r\n\nenforce the Guaranty against Alletzhauser since HTRA, the primary\r\n\nobligor, was not in default on its loan obligation to Thorn, Ltd.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The relevant Guaranty provisions are set out below:\r\n\nSection 2 - Guaranty of Payment and Performance\r                                                         \r\nThe Guarantor unconditionally guarantees . . . the prompt payment\r\nby the  Borrower to  the Lender of  the Subordinated  Obligations\r\nwhen  and as the Subordinated  Obligations become due and payable\r\nin accordance with their terms . . . .\r\n\nSection 3 - Obligations Unconditional\r                                               \r\n. . .

Thorn,  Ltd.\r\n\nresponds  that the loan obligation  became due on  April 1, 1994,\r\n\nand  since HTRA has not paid, Alletzhauser must honor the Guaran-\r\n\nty.   The  parties agree  that  Massachusetts law  governs  their\r\n\ndispute.\r\n\n          Under  Massachusetts  law, a  guarantor's  liability is\r\n\ndetermined by the terms  of the guaranty agreement; as  a general\r\n\nrule, the terms  of the  guaranty are not  construed against  the\r\n\nguarantor.   See Merrimack Valley Nat'l Bank v. Baird, 363 N.E.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n688, 690-91 (Mass. 1977).  The operative provision in the Guaran-\r\n\nty states that Alletzhauser \"unconditionally guarantees . . . the\r\n\nprompt  payment by the Borrower to the Lender of the Subordinated\r\n\nObligations when  and as the Subordinated  Obligations become due\r                                                                           \r\n\nand payable in accordance with their terms  . . . . \"  See  supra\r                                                                           \r\n\nnote 3,   2 (emphasis added).

This  provides for  periodic  payments by  HTRA and\r\n\nfurther provides  that all outstanding principal  and accrued but\r\n\nunpaid interest \"shall be due and payable on April 1, 1994.\"  See\r                                                                           \r\n\ninfra Appendix p. i,   1.  \r               \r\n\n          Alletzhauser responds that the court must interpret the\r\n\nNote as a whole, and that the  unconditional subordination provi-\r\n\nsions  in section  4 plainly  supersede the payment  schedule set\r\n\nforth in section 1.5   Section 4 contains the  following subordi-\r                             5\r\n\nnation  provision:  \"Notwithstanding any  other provision  of the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5See Culp v.

App. 1987) (ruling that subordination provisions in\r\nnotes superseded schedule for annual interest payments).  Alletz-\r\nhauser suggests that the  Note provides for \"complete\" subordina-\r\ntion, which  is not uncommon  in circumstances  where the  junior\r\nlender is a parent company or an officer, director, or stockhold-\r\ner  of  the borrower.

Thorn, Ltd.\r                   \r\n\ninsists that the subordination  provisions, interpreted in  light\r\n\nof subsection  4.5(a), reflected  the overarching concern  of the\r\n\noriginal senior lender (Beverly  National Bank) that its priority\r\n\nright  to  payments from  HTRA not  be  jeopardized by  any right\r\n\nThorn,  Ltd. had  to payment  from HTRA;  and, further,  that any\r\n\nattempt  by Thorn,  Ltd. to proceed  against Alletzhauser  on the\r\n\nGuaranty  not be permitted to affect the senior lender's right to\r\n\npriority payment,  nor undermine  HTRA's ability to  repay senior\r\n\ndebt according to its  terms.  As this lawsuit  only contemplates\r\n\nrecovery  from Alletzhauser and not HTRA, Thorn, Ltd. urges us to\r\n\ndisregard  section 4, and instead  give full effect  to the April\r\n\n1994 due date specified in section 1. \r\n\n          In addition  to subsection 4.5(a),  Thorn, Ltd.  points\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nout that the unquestioned  purpose of the Guaranty was  to induce\r\n\nThorn, Ltd. to transfer its  general partnership interest in HTRA\r\n\nto HLI, a company partly owned by Alletzhauser.   With the resul-\r\n\ntant transfer of control, Thorn, Ltd. lost all ability to require\r\n\nHTRA to satisfy its senior debt to Bank of Boston, as well as any\r\n\npower  to control  the  timing of  its  own recovery  from  HTRA.\r\n\nThorn,  Ltd. maintains, therefore, that section 1 of the Note was\r\n\nmeant  to offset  its loss  of control  by prescribing  a payment\r\n\nschedule  which would  continue to  govern the  ongoing repayment\r\n\nrelationship between Thorn,  Ltd. and  Alletzhauser.   Otherwise,\r\n\nThorn, Ltd.  might never be able to collect on either the Note or\r\n\nthe Guaranty. \r\n\n          Confronted with these mutually incompatible interpreta-\r\n\ntions,  we conclude  that neither  satisfactorily  reconciles the\r\n\nconflicting contract language so as to enable summary judgment on\r\n\nthe  present record.   The  Alletzhauser interpretation  comports\r\n\nwith  the classic construct of a  loan guaranty,8 as well as with\r\n\nthe  parties' \"course of performance.\"9   On the  other hand, the\r                                                                        \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Indeed,  permitting  recovery   from  Alletzhauser  on  the\r\nGuaranty  would result  in  a corresponding  depletion of  HTRA's\r\nassets  prior to repayment of  the senior debt  in the event that\r\nAlletzhauser is entitled to indemnification from HTRA, see 38 Am.\r                                                                    \r\nJur. 2d Guaranty   127 (1968); Restatement (Second) of Security  \r                                                                         \r\n104(1) (1941),  notwithstanding the  fact that  the subordination\r\nprovisions are designed to protect  senior lenders from just such\r\nan occurrence. \r\n\n     9Thorn,  Ltd. does  not explain  why it  made no  attempt to\r\nenforce its rights sooner despite the fact that HTRA had not made\r\na  single payment of interest or principal in accordance with the\r\npayment schedule in section 1 of the Note, either before or after\r\nThorn, Ltd. transferred control  to HLI in July 1991.

Yet  their\r\n\naffidavits provide little information concerning the actual terms\r\n\nof their negotiations and each party draws a different conclusion\r\n\nas to their import.  Were  we to approve summary judgment without\r\n\nmore information, the  result reached might well  fail to reflect\r\n\nthe  aims and intentions of  the parties.

(\"Thorn, Ltd.\") appeals a summary judgment order disallowing its claim for breach of a loan guaranty by defendant Albert J. Alletzhauser (\"Alletzhauser\").  As we conclude that Alletzhauser is not entitled to judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) under Massachusetts law, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, 1989, an individual named Laura Thorn loaned $250,000 to Hamilton/Thorn Research Associates (\"HTRA\").  At that time, Laura Thorn was the principal shareholder in Thorn, Ltd., and Thorn, Ltd. in turn was a general partner in HTRA.  Under the terms of a Subordinated Loan Agreement (\"Agreement\") and a Subordinated Promissory Note (\"Note\"), HTRA's loan obligation to Laura Thorn was subordinated to all existing and future HTRA obligations to Beverly National Bank or its successors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On December 31, 1990, Laura Thorn assigned all her rights under the Agreement and Note to Thorn, Ltd.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1991, Thorn, Ltd. negotiated a transfer of its general partnership interest in HTRA to Hamilton Laboratories, Inc.  (\"HLI\"), a corporation partly owned by Alletzhauser.  To induce the transfer, Alletzhauser (as guarantor), HTRA (as maker), and Thorn, Ltd.  (as subordinated lender), entered into a loan guaranty agreement (\"the Guaranty\") on July 11, 1991, whereby Alletzhauser guaranteed prompt payment of HTRA's debt to Thorn, Ltd. \"when and as the Subordinated Obligations become due and payable in accordance with their terms....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Pursuant to section 1 of the Note and the Guaranty, on April 8, 1994, Thorn, Ltd. demanded full payment from Alletzhauser.  HTRA and Alletzhauser declined on the ground that payment was not due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1994, Thorn, Ltd. commenced this action against Alletzhauser in federal district court to enforce its Guaranty.  Alletzhauser denied liability, and asserted as an affirmative defense that legal action on the Guaranty was \"premature.\"   Ultimately, the district court entered summary judgment against Thorn, Ltd. on the ground that it had no present right to enforce the Guaranty against Alletzhauser since HTRA, the primary obligor, was not in default on its loan obligation to Thorn, Ltd.  Thorn, Ltd. contends on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment and abused its discretion in refusing to strike certain affidavits submitted in support of Alletzhauser's motion for summary judgment.II</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alletzhauser acknowledges the validity of the Guaranty, but contends that the present attempt to enforce it is premature since the loan obligation itself is not yet due.  Thorn, Ltd. responds that the loan obligation became due on April 1, 1994, and since HTRA has not paid, Alletzhauser must honor the Guaranty.  The parties agree that Massachusetts law governs their dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, a guarantor's liability is determined by the terms of the guaranty agreement;  as a general rule, the terms of the guaranty are not construed against the guarantor.  See Merrimack Valley Nat'l Bank v. Baird, 372 Mass. 721, 363 N.E.2d 688, 690-91 (1977).  The operative provision in the Guaranty states that Alletzhauser \"unconditionally guarantees ... the prompt payment by the Borrower to the Lender of the Subordinated Obligations when and as the Subordinated Obligations become due and payable in accordance with their terms ....\"  See supra note 3, Sec. 2 (emphasis added).  No other provision in the Guaranty expressly states when Thorn, Ltd. may look to Alletzhauser for payment under the Guaranty, and the parties agree that the court must examine the Note to determine when Alletzhauser is obligated to make good on the Guaranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that HTRA was not obligated to repay the Note as long as senior debt remained outstanding.  Thorn, Ltd. insists that the district court misinterpreted the plain language of the Note, which includes a payment schedule in section 1.  This provides for periodic payments by HTRA and further provides that all outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest \"shall be due and payable on April 1, 1994.\"   See infra Appendix p. 995, Sec. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alletzhauser responds that the court must interpret the Note as a whole, and that the unconditional subordination provisions in section 4 plainly supersede the payment schedule set forth in section 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Section 4 contains the following subordination provision:  \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the Subordinated Loan Documents,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the Maker [HTRA], and each holder of this note [Thorn, Ltd.] ... agree that the Subordinated Debt shall be subordinated as set forth in this Section 4 to all present and future extensions of credit to the Maker by The Beverly National Bank [or its successors]....\"  See infra Appendix p. 995, Sec. 4.  More to the present point, subsection 4.4 expressly restricts the right of Thorn, Ltd. to enforce the Note against HTRA.  \"Notwithstanding any contrary term or provision of the Subordinated Debt Documents, (i) no Subordinated Debt shall become or be declared to be due and payable prior to the date on which the Senior Debt becomes or is declared to be due and payable ....\"  See infra Appendix p. 996, Sec. 4.4 (emphasis added).  Since there is no dispute that senior debt to Bank of Boston remains outstanding, Alletzhauser argues that the district court correctly ruled that HTRA's primary loan obligation to Thorn, Ltd. is not yet due, and therefore, he presently has no obligation on the Guaranty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thorn, Ltd. contends that subsection 4.4 does not affect its right to enforce its Guaranty against Alletzhauser, as distinguished from its rights against HTRA under the Note.  Thorn, Ltd. finds support for this contention in subsection 4.5(a):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>The provisions of this Section 4 are solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holders of Senior Debt on the one hand, and the holders of Subordinated Debt on the other hand, and none of such provisions shall impair as between the Maker and any holder of Subordinated Debt the obligation of the Maker [HTRA], which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to such holder of Subordinated Debt the principal and premium, if any, thereof and interest thereon, and all other amounts in respect thereof, all in accordance with the terms thereof, nor shall any such provisions prevent any holder of Subordinated Debt from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law or under the terms of such Subordinated Debt upon a default thereunder, subject to the rights, if any, under the provisions of this Section 4 of holders of Senior Debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See infra Appendix p. 996, Sec. 4.5(a) (emphasis added).  Thorn, Ltd. insists that the subordination provisions, interpreted in light of subsection 4.5(a), reflected the overarching concern of the original senior lender (Beverly National Bank) that its priority right to payments from HTRA not be jeopardized by any right Thorn, Ltd. had to payment from HTRA;  and, further, that any attempt by Thorn, Ltd. to proceed against Alletzhauser on the Guaranty not be permitted to affect the senior lender's right to priority payment, nor undermine HTRA's ability to repay senior debt according to its terms.  As this lawsuit only contemplates recovery from Alletzhauser and not HTRA, Thorn, Ltd. urges us to disregard section 4, and instead give full effect to the April 1994 due date specified in section 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to subsection 4.5(a), Thorn, Ltd. points out that the unquestioned purpose of the Guaranty was to induce Thorn, Ltd. to transfer its general partnership interest in HTRA to HLI, a company partly owned by Alletzhauser.  With the resultant transfer of control, Thorn, Ltd. lost all ability to require HTRA to satisfy its senior debt to Bank of Boston, as well as any power to control the timing of its own recovery from HTRA.  Thorn, Ltd. maintains, therefore, that section 1 of the Note was meant to offset its loss of control by prescribing a payment schedule which would continue to govern the ongoing repayment relationship between Thorn, Ltd. and Alletzhauser.  Otherwise, Thorn, Ltd. might never be able to collect on either the Note or the Guaranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confronted with these mutually incompatible interpretations, we conclude that neither satisfactorily reconciles the conflicting contract language so as to enable summary judgment on the present record.  The Alletzhauser interpretation comports with the classic construct of a loan guaranty,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> as well as with the parties' \"course of performance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  On the other hand, the context in which the execution of the Guaranty took place gives no indication as to why Thorn, Ltd. would permit a virtually perpetual loan repayment extension to an enterprise it no longer owned.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Both parties represent that substantial negotiations attended the drafting of the Note and Guaranty.  Yet their affidavits provide little information concerning the actual terms of their negotiations and each party draws a different conclusion as to their import.  Were we to approve summary judgment without more information, the result reached might well fail to reflect the aims and intentions of the parties.  See Merrimack Valley, 363 N.E.2d at 690 (\"[W]hen a contract term is ambiguous, its import is ascertained from the parties' intent as manifested by the guaranty's terms and the circumstances surrounding its creation, such as [the] relationship of the parties, actions of the parties and established business usages.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally, we would not press for further record development absent a clearer indication that further evidence will be forthcoming.  We are convinced nonetheless that a remand for further proceedings is appropriate here:  the contract language is in conflict;  there is no public policy consideration to tip the balance;  and there is a much better prospect of resolving this private conflict as the parties intended, if an effort is made to discern their intentions based on their actual negotiations and the events that led up to and followed the Guaranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the unresolved conflict in the language of the guaranty and loan documents and the dearth of evidence relating to the parties' intent, we conclude that Alletzhauser failed to establish an entitlement to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore vacate the judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  The parties shall bear their own costs.

At that time, Laura Thorn was the principal shareholder in Thorn, Ltd., and Thorn, Ltd. in turn was a general partner in HTRA.  Under the terms of a Subordinated Loan Agreement (\"Agreement\") and a Subordinated Promissory Note (\"Note\"), HTRA's loan obligation to Laura Thorn was subordinated to all existing and future HTRA obligations to Beverly National Bank or its successors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On December 31, 1990, Laura Thorn assigned all her rights under the Agreement and Note to Thorn, Ltd.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1991, Thorn, Ltd. negotiated a transfer of its general partnership interest in HTRA to Hamilton Laboratories, Inc.  (\"HLI\"), a corporation partly owned by Alletzhauser.  To induce the transfer, Alletzhauser (as guarantor), HTRA (as maker), and Thorn, Ltd.  (as subordinated lender), entered into a loan guaranty agreement (\"the Guaranty\") on July 11, 1991, whereby Alletzhauser guaranteed prompt payment of HTRA's debt to Thorn, Ltd. \"when and as the Subordinated Obligations become due and payable in accordance with their terms....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Pursuant to section 1 of the Note and the Guaranty, on April 8, 1994, Thorn, Ltd. demanded full payment from Alletzhauser.  HTRA and Alletzhauser declined on the ground that payment was not due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1994, Thorn, Ltd. commenced this action against Alletzhauser in federal district court to enforce its Guaranty.  Alletzhauser denied liability, and asserted as an affirmative defense that legal action on the Guaranty was \"premature.\"   Ultimately, the district court entered summary judgment against Thorn, Ltd. on the ground that it had no present right to enforce the Guaranty against Alletzhauser since HTRA, the primary obligor, was not in default on its loan obligation to Thorn, Ltd.  Thorn, Ltd. contends on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment and abused its discretion in refusing to strike certain affidavits submitted in support of Alletzhauser's motion for summary judgment.II</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alletzhauser acknowledges the validity of the Guaranty, but contends that the present attempt to enforce it is premature since the loan obligation itself is not yet due.  Thorn, Ltd. responds that the loan obligation became due on April 1, 1994, and since HTRA has not paid, Alletzhauser must honor the Guaranty.  The parties agree that Massachusetts law governs their dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, a guarantor's liability is determined by the terms of the guaranty agreement;  as a general rule, the terms of the guaranty are not construed against the guarantor.  See Merrimack Valley Nat'l Bank v. Baird, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2045944\"><a href=\"/opinion/2045944/merrimack-valley-national-bank-v-baird/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2045944\"><a href=\"/opinion/2045944/merrimack-valley-national-bank-v-baird/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span>, 690-91 (1977).  The operative provision in the Guaranty states that Alletzhauser \"unconditionally guarantees ... the prompt payment by the Borrower to the Lender of the Subordinated Obligations when and as the Subordinated Obligations become due and payable in accordance with their terms ....\"  See supra note 3, Sec. 2 (emphasis added).  No other provision in the Guaranty expressly states when Thorn, Ltd. may look to Alletzhauser for payment under the Guaranty, and the parties agree that the court must examine the Note to determine when Alletzhauser is obligated to make good on the Guaranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that HTRA was not obligated to repay the Note as long as senior debt remained outstanding.  Thorn, Ltd. insists that the district court misinterpreted the plain language of the Note, which includes a payment schedule in section 1.  This provides for periodic payments by HTRA and further provides that all outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest \"shall be due and payable on April 1, 1994.\"   See infra Appendix p. 995, Sec. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alletzhauser responds that the court must interpret the Note as a whole, and that the unconditional subordination provisions in section 4 plainly supersede the payment schedule set forth in section 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Section 4 contains the following subordination provision:  \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the Subordinated Loan Documents,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the Maker [HTRA], and each holder of this note [Thorn, Ltd.] ... agree that the Subordinated Debt shall be subordinated as set forth in this Section 4 to all present and future extensions of credit to the Maker by The Beverly National Bank [or its successors]....\"  See infra Appendix p. 995, Sec. 4.  More to the present point, subsection 4.4 expressly restricts the right of Thorn, Ltd. to enforce the Note against HTRA.  \"Notwithstanding any contrary term or provision of the Subordinated Debt Documents, (i) no Subordinated Debt shall become or be declared to be due and payable prior to the date on which the Senior Debt becomes or is declared to be due and payable ....\"  See infra Appendix p. 996, Sec. 4.4 (emphasis added).  Since there is no dispute that senior debt to Bank of Boston remains outstanding, Alletzhauser argues that the district court correctly ruled that HTRA's primary loan obligation to Thorn, Ltd. is not yet due, and therefore, he presently has no obligation on the Guaranty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thorn, Ltd. contends that subsection 4.4 does not affect its right to enforce its Guaranty against Alletzhauser, as distinguished from its rights against HTRA under the Note.  Thorn, Ltd. finds support for this contention in subsection 4.5(a):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>The provisions of this Section 4 are solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holders of Senior Debt on the one hand, and the holders of Subordinated Debt on the other hand, and none of such provisions shall impair as between the Maker and any holder of Subordinated Debt the obligation of the Maker [HTRA], which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to such holder of Subordinated Debt the principal and premium, if any, thereof and interest thereon, and all other amounts in respect thereof, all in accordance with the terms thereof, nor shall any such provisions prevent any holder of Subordinated Debt from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law or under the terms of such Subordinated Debt upon a default thereunder, subject to the rights, if any, under the provisions of this Section 4 of holders of Senior Debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See infra Appendix p. 996, Sec. 4.5(a) (emphasis added).  Thorn, Ltd. insists that the subordination provisions, interpreted in light of subsection 4.5(a), reflected the overarching concern of the original senior lender (Beverly National Bank) that its priority right to payments from HTRA not be jeopardized by any right Thorn, Ltd. had to payment from HTRA;  and, further, that any attempt by Thorn, Ltd. to proceed against Alletzhauser on the Guaranty not be permitted to affect the senior lender's right to priority payment, nor undermine HTRA's ability to repay senior debt according to its terms.  As this lawsuit only contemplates recovery from Alletzhauser and not HTRA, Thorn, Ltd. urges us to disregard section 4, and instead give full effect to the April 1994 due date specified in section 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to subsection 4.5(a), Thorn, Ltd. points out that the unquestioned purpose of the Guaranty was to induce Thorn, Ltd. to transfer its general partnership interest in HTRA to HLI, a company partly owned by Alletzhauser.  With the resultant transfer of control, Thorn, Ltd. lost all ability to require HTRA to satisfy its senior debt to Bank of Boston, as well as any power to control the timing of its own recovery from HTRA.  Thorn, Ltd. maintains, therefore, that section 1 of the Note was meant to offset its loss of control by prescribing a payment schedule which would continue to govern the ongoing repayment relationship between Thorn, Ltd. and Alletzhauser.  Otherwise, Thorn, Ltd. might never be able to collect on either the Note or the Guaranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confronted with these mutually incompatible interpretations, we conclude that neither satisfactorily reconciles the conflicting contract language so as to enable summary judgment on the present record.  The Alletzhauser interpretation comports with the classic construct of a loan guaranty,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> as well as with the parties' \"course of performance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  On the other hand, the context in which the execution of the Guaranty took place gives no indication as to why Thorn, Ltd. would permit a virtually perpetual loan repayment extension to an enterprise it no longer owned.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Both parties represent that substantial negotiations attended the drafting of the Note and Guaranty.  Yet their affidavits provide little information concerning the actual terms of their negotiations and each party draws a different conclusion as to their import.  Were we to approve summary judgment without more information, the result reached might well fail to reflect the aims and intentions of the parties.
