Defendant forwards  four\r\n\nissues  on appeal  which  we consider  seriatim.   We  affirm\r\n\ndefendant's conviction.\r\n\n1.  The  Alleged Violation of  the Jencks Act  - 18 U.S.C.   \r            1.  The  Alleged Violation of  the Jencks Act  - 18 U.S.C.   \r                                                                         \r\n\n3500\r            3500\r                \r\n\nThe factual basis for  this issue is the accidental\r\n\ndestruction  of certain tape recordings by a DEA agent.  This\r\n\nis the  second time we  have been  called upon to  decide the\r\n\nlegal consequences of the destruction of the tape recordings.\r\n\nSome historical exegesis is necessary, most of which is taken\r\n\nfrom  our prior opinion, United  States v. Femia,  9 F.3d 990\r                                                            \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (\"Femia I\"). \r                                   \r\n\nAn  indictment  against defendant  and  eight other\r\n\nalleged co-conspirators  was filed  in the district  court on\r\n\nOctober 3, 1986.  Femia was not arrested until July 16, 1992.\r\n\nThe facts relevant to  the tape recordings can  be summarized\r\n\nas follows.\r\n\nCristopher LaPlante  was the bookkeeper and  one of\r\n\nthe  founding  members of  a  large-scale  cocaine operation,\r\n\nknown as Triple X.  The DEA started investigating Triple X in\r\n\n1985.  LaPlante entered into a plea bargain with the DEA.  As\r\n\npart of  the plea  agreement, LaPlante covertly  made twenty-\r\n\n              -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nfour  tape  recordings  of  conversations  he  had  with  co-\r\n\nconspirators or  customers of Triple X.  The DEA set up three\r\n\nfiles for three of the alleged co-conspirators, Perea, Stone,\r\n\nand  Femia.  The LaPlante tapes were physically stored in the\r\n\nPerea  file,  which was  cross-referenced  to  the other  two\r\n\nfiles.  \r\n\nTrial of Femia's  alleged co-conspirators was  held\r\n\nin 1987.  At this  time Femia was still at large.   The eight\r\n\ndefendants were  convicted either  by trial or  guilty pleas.\r\n\nSubsequent to those convictions, a DEA agent,  newly-assigned\r\n\nto the case,  authorized the destruction of all  the LaPlante\r\n\ntapes contained in the Perea file.\r\n\nAfter his  arrest and  arraignment, Femia  moved to\r\n\nsuppress the testimony of LaPlante, a key government witness,\r\n\non  the ground that the destruction of the tapes violated his\r\n\nconstitutional right  to due process as  annunciated in Brady\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).  The district court granted\r                        \r\n\nFemia's  motion to  suppress.   The government appealed.   We\r\n\nreversed the district  court, finding that  there was no  due\r\n\nprocess violation  because the  tapes were \"not  destroyed in\r\n\nbad faith.\"  Femia  I, 9 F.3d  at 994.   We also pointed  out\r                              \r\n\nthat  the  district  court  had  made  no  bad  faith finding\r\n\nrelative to the destruction of the tapes.  Id. at 996.  After\r                                                          \r\n\nremand,  the case  was  tried.   The district  court rejected\r\n\n              -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nFemia's  claim  that  the  destruction  of the  tapes  was  a\r\n\nviolation of the Jencks Act.\r\n\nWe start our analysis of  this issue by quoting the\r\n\ndistrict  court's written rejection of defendant's Jencks Act\r\n\nclaim:\r\n\n   Defendant also contends that\r\njudgment  of  acquittal  as  to\r\nCount 1  is appropriate because\r\nthe  government   violated  the\r\nJencks Act, 18  U.S.C.    3500.\r\nHe  bases  this  claim  on  the\r\ngovernment's   destruction   of\r\ntape recordings made by its key\r\nwitness,  Cristopher  LaPlante,\r\nand     allegedly    containing\r\nstatements amounting  to Jencks\r\nmaterial.     The   Jencks  Act\r\nprovides  that  a court  shall,\r\nupon defendant's request, order\r\nthe   government   to   produce\r\nstatements made  by its witness\r\nwhich  relate to  the witness's\r\ntestimony.    18 U.S.C.    3500\r\n(1970).  Such statements may be\r\nused  solely   for  impeachment\r\npurposes.    Palermo v.  United\r                                                          \r\nStates,   360  U.S.   343,  349\r                                 \r\n(1959).   Defendant  speculates\r\nthat  the  tapes  revealed  the\r\nidentities of  large scale drug\r\nsuppliers,  thereby  containing\r\nstatements      related      to\r\nLaPlante's testimony.   Because\r\nthe  tapes   were  destroyed  I\r\ncannot  review  them  and  thus\r\nassess whether they fall within\r\nthe purview of the  Jencks Act.\r\nThe  record does  not, however,\r\nrequire   me    to   make   the\r\n\"dubious\"       inquiry      of\r\n\"reconstruct[ing]  a  [tape] no\r\nlonger in  existence using 'the\r\nvery  witness  whose  testimony\r\nthe    defendant    seeks    to\r\nimpeach.'\"    United States  v.\r                                                          \r\n\n              -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nCarrasco,  537  F.2d  372,  377\r                                   \r\n(9th Cir. 1976) (quoting United\r                                                          \r\nStates  v.  Johnson,  521  F.2d\r                                              \r\n1318,  1320  (9th Cir.  1975)).\r\nHere,  the affidavits  of Agent\r\nReilly  and  Detective  Kinder,\r\nwhich  stated that  the missing\r\ntapes     \"contained    general\r\nconversations  that   were  not\r\nspecifically  relevant  to  the\r\nTriple     X    investigation,\"\r\nsupport  the  ruling  at  trial\r\nthat the missing tapes were not\r\n\"Jencks   Act  materials   with\r\nrespect  to  the matters  about\r\nwhich  the  government inquired\r\non direct . . . .\"  \r\n\n(Footnote omitted.)\r\n\nWe review the district  court's ruling for abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.    United  States  v. Augenblick,  393  U.S.  348\r                                                        \r\n\n(1969).  Augenblick involved,  inter alia, missing tapes that\r                                                     \r\n\nwere,  without doubt, covered by  the Jencks Act.   The Court\r\n\nheld that  the ruling by the law  officer and Board of Review\r\n\nthat the tapes  need not be produced under the Jencks Act was\r\n\nnot  an abuse  of discretion.   Id.  at 355.   In  Palermo v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited States, 360 U.S.  343 (1959), the Court held  that the\r                         \r\n\nfinal  decision as  to  production of  Jencks Act  statements\r\n\n\"must rest  . . . within the good sense and experience of the\r\n\ndistrict judge  . . . .\"   Id. at  353.  In United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFoley,  871 F.2d  235,  239 (1st  Cir.  1989), we  found  not\r                 \r\n\nclearly erroneous the district court's ruling  that so-called\r\n\n\"302's\" were not statements covered by the Jencks Act.\r\n\nThe pertinent parts of the Jencks Act provide:\r\n\n              -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n   After  a  witness called  by\r\nthe United States has testified\r\non   direct  examination,   the\r\ncourt shall, on  motion of  the\r\ndefendant,  order   the  United\r\nStates to produce any statement\r\n(as hereinafter defined) of the\r\nwitness  in  the possession  of\r\nthe United States which relates\r\nto  the  subject  matter as  to\r\nwhich    the     witness    has\r\ntestified.     If   the  entire\r\ncontents of  any such statement\r\nrelate to the subject matter of\r\nthe  testimony of  the witness,\r\nthe  court shall order it to be\r\ndelivered   directly   to   the\r\ndefendant  for his  examination\r\nand use.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3500(b).\r\n\n   The  term   \"statement\",  as\r\nused  in subsections  (b), (c),\r\nand  (d)  of  this  section  in\r\nrelation to  any witness called\r\nby the United States, means--\r\n\n   . . . .\r\n\n   a  stenographic, mechanical,\r\nelectrical, or other recording,\r\nor  a   transcription  thereof,\r\nwhich   is   a    substantially\r\nverbatim  recital  of  an  oral\r\nstatement made  by said witness\r\nand  recorded contemporaneously\r\nwith  the  making of  such oral\r\nstatement;\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3500(e)(2).\r\n\nThere is nothing in  the record indicating that any\r\n\nof the  destroyed tapes  contained statements related  to the\r\n\nsubject  matter of LaPlante's testimony.   On the other hand,\r\n\nthe missing tape  observation we made in Femia I  is a strong\r                                                          \r\n\n              -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nindication  that  the  tapes   did  not  contain  Jencks  Act\r\n\nstatements:\r\n\nThe    evidence   before    the\r\ndistrict court  showed that any\r\nmissing  evidence--whether  one\r\nconsiders   allegedly   missing\r\nfragments  of   the  tapes  for\r\nwhich  copies  exist  or  those\r\ntapes which no longer  exist in\r\nany   form--did   not   possess\r\nexculpatory    value   apparent\r                                                          \r\nbefore      law     enforcement\r                                 \r\ndestroyed  the  tapes.    Agent\r\nReilly  and  Detective   Kinder\r\nprovided   affidavits   stating\r\nthat   the    destroyed   tapes\r\ncontained   no   references  to\r\nFemia,   his   code  names   or\r\nnumbers.    Agent  Reilly  also\r\nexplained    that    any   tape\r\ncontaining references  to Femia\r\nwould have been transcribed.\r\n\nFemia I, 9 F.2d at 995.\r                 \r\n\nIn light of  the facts and  the applicable law,  we\r\n\nrule that  the district  court neither abused  its discretion\r\n\nnor clearly erred in finding and  ruling as it did.  We think\r\n\nits decision was clearly correct.\r\n\n2.  Whether the Supplemental Jury Instruction on Conspiracy\r            2.  Whether the Supplemental Jury Instruction on Conspiracy\r                                                                       \r\nWas Reversible Error\r                Was Reversible Error\r                                    \r\n\nThe  only  way  to  understand  this  issue  is  to\r\n\nreplicate what  happened.   After deliberating  for sometime,\r\n\nthe jury submitted two  written questions to the judge.   She\r\n\nresponded as follows:\r\n\n   Members of the jury,  let me\r\nrespond to your note, do it one\r\nat  a time, and so I will state\r\n\n              -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nfor   the   record,   for   Mr.\r\nLaughlin, each question.\r\n\n  Question 1 is:   Restate  the\r\ncharges.\r\n\n   I interpret that to mean the\r\naccusations against  Mr. Femia.\r\nI assume that's what you meant,\r\nthat you didn't wish me to give\r\nyou  the instructions  all over\r\nagain.\r\n\n   There   are   two  sets   of\r\ncharges.  Count  1 accuses  the\r\ndefendant  of   having  been  a\r\nmember   of  a   conspiracy  to\r\ndistribute  cocaine.     That's\r\nCount 1.\r\n\n   There are two -- there's one\r\nentirely   separate   set    of\r\ncharges, Counts  22 through 45,\r\nthat  accuse  the defendant  of\r\nhaving  possessed  on  specific\r\ndates,   specific  amounts   of\r\ncocaine  with   the  intent  to\r\ndistribute that cocaine.\r\n\n   That's  the  second  set  of\r\ncharges.\r\n\n   Now,  let me  go back  for a\r\nmoment and explain again to you\r\neach of these.\r\n\n   With respect to Count 1, the\r\nconspiracy      charge,     the\r\ngovernment has to prove, first,\r\nthat  there  was  an  agreement\r\nbetween two or more people, not\r\nnecessarily  Mr.  Femia,  could\r\nhave   been   anybody.      The\r\nindictment  names some  people,\r\nbut any two people,  that there\r\nwas  an  agreement between  any\r\ntwo   people    to   distribute\r\ncocaine.     That's  the  first\r\nthing it has to prove.\r\n\n              -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n   The second thing  it has  to\r\nprove is that Mr. Femia at some\r\npoint,  while  this  agreement,\r\nthis    conspiracy    was    in\r\nexistence, willfully,  that is,\r\nwith an intent  to violate  the\r\nlaw,  became  a member  of that\r\nconspiracy.    That's what  the\r\ngovernment has to prove.\r\n\nThe second question was:\r\n\nIn  Count 1, is paragraph 1 the\r                                                          \r\nsummation  of  charges  against\r                                    \r\nMr. Femia, or  is paragraph  2b\r\n(Count 1) part of the summation\r                                                          \r\nof   charges   or   simply   an\r\nexplanation   of   charges   in\r                                      \r\nCounts 22-45.  Specifically--is\r\nthe   defendant  charged   with\r\nconspiracy     to    distribute\r\ncocaine   or   conspiracy    to\r\ndistribute   the  specific   47\r\nkilograms  named  in  paragraph\r\n2b.  (Id.)\r                                    \r\n\nThe judge answered the question thus:\r\n\n   Now you  also inquired about\r\nParagraph   2B   [b]  in   this\r\nindictment.    The   conspiracy\r\ncharge  sets  out, in  general,\r\nwhat  the  conspiracy  was  all\r\nabout.   It  then  goes  on  in\r\nParagraph  2  to  describe,  in\r\ngeneral, the  role that various\r\nof  the  defendants  played  in\r\nthis conspiracy.   And then  it\r\ngoes on in Paragraph 3  and its\r\nvarious sub parts  to say  what\r\nthe purpose of this, the object\r\nof this conspiracy was.  And it\r\nkind of goes  on and on and  on\r\nabout that.\r\n\n   In  Paragraph  2B  [b],  the\r\ngovernment says what it -- what\r\nit says Mr. Femia  did.  But in\r\nyour   deliberating   on   your\r\nverdict and deciding this case,\r\n\n              -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nyou  should   base,  base  your\r\nverdict   not   on   what   the\r\nindictment says, but on  all of\r\nthe  evidence.   Taking  all of\r\nthe   evidence,  you   need  to\r\ndecide what Mr. Femia did, what\r\nMr.   Femia   knew,  what   the\r\ncircumstances were.\r\n\n   And  then  based  on all  of\r\nthat, all the  evidence in  the\r\ncase,  what the  witnesses told\r\nyou,  what  the  exhibits  tell\r\nyou, did he willfully  become a\r\nmember of the conspiracy?   And\r\nspecifically did the government\r\nprove  and  convince  you  that\r\nbeyond a  reasonable doubt that\r\nhe -- there was  this agreement\r\nand that he willfully  became a\r\nmember of the conspiracy.\r\n\nThe first paragraph of  Count One of the indictment\r\n\ncharged nine named persons including Femia:\r\n\ndefendants      herein,     did\r\nknowingly   and   intentionally\r\ncombine,  conspire, confederate\r\nand  agree   with  each  other,\r\n. . . and with other persons to\r\ncommit  an offense  against the\r\nUnited   States,    namely   to\r\npossess    with    intent    to\r\ndistribute, and  to distribute,\r\nquantities   of    cocaine,   a\r\nSchedule II narcotic controlled\r\nsubstance,   in  violation   of\r\nTitle  21, United  States Code,\r\nSection 841(a)(1).\r\n\nParagraph 2b of Count One of the indictment states:\r\n\n   b.    Defendant  Noel  Femia\r\nalso supplied  large quantities\r\nof cocaine to  Triple X.   From\r\nJuly   1984   to  April   1985,\r\ndefendant Noel Femia caused the\r\ndelivery    of    approximately\r\nforty-seven     kilograms    of\r\n\n              -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ncocaine,  having  an  aggregate\r\nwholesale  value of  nearly two\r\nmillion dollars, to Triple X on\r\nconsignment.          Following\r\ndelivery, this cocaine was sold\r\nand distributed  by members and\r\nassociates of Triple X.\r\n\nBy now  it is axiomatic \"that  a single instruction\r\n\nto a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must\r\n\nbe  viewed in the  context of the  overall charge.\"   Cupp v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nNaughten, 414 U.S. 141, 146-47 (1973).  In this connection we\r                    \r\n\nnote that defendant did not object to the original conspiracy\r\n\ncharge which was, of course, more extensive and detailed than\r\n\nthe   supplemental  one,  but  basically  conveyed  the  same\r\n\nmessage.\r\n\nIt is  difficult for  us to understand  exactly the\r\n\nbasis  for  defendant's  contention  that   the  supplemental\r\n\ninstruction  was  erroneous.    It  might  be  inferred  from\r\n\ndefendant's brief  that he  is arguing  that the jury  should\r\n\nhave  been instructed that in  order to convict  Femia on the\r\n\nconspiracy count,  the government had to prove the overt acts\r\n\nalleged in paragraph 2b.   At the sidebar colloquy  after the\r\n\nsupplemental instructions were given, the judge asked defense\r\n\ncounsel:   \"What  do  you want  me  to tell  them?\"   Counsel\r\n\nreplied:\r\n\nMR.  CARROLL:   This is  what I\r\nwant you to say, Judge.  I want\r\nyou  to  say that  Paragraph 2B\r\n[b] is what the  government has\r\naccused  Mr.  Femia  of  doing.\r\nThat's what they said he did in\r\n\n              -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nthis  conspiracy, that  was his\r\nrole in the conspiracy, and the\r\ngovernment must  prove beyond a\r\nreasonable  doubt that  is what\r\nhe did.\r\n\nThe judge quite correctly pointed out:  \"No.  That's  not the\r\n\nlaw.\"  \r\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously held in United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

To\r\nprove a  drug conspiracy charge\r\nunder  21  U.S.C.     846,  the\r\ngovernment  is obliged  to show\r\nbeyond a  reasonable doubt that\r\na conspiracy existed and that a\r\nparticular defendant agreed  to\r\nparticipate in it, intending to\r\ncommit      the      underlying\r\nsubstantive    offense   (here,\r\npossession   of  cocaine   with\r\nintent to distribute, 21 U.S.C.\r\n  841(a)(1).\r\n\nId.  at  1173  (citations  omitted).1    That  was  what  the\r               \r\n\n     \r                                \r\n\n1.

Cristopher (Cris)  LaPlante, the chief witness for\r\n\nthe prosecution,  testified that  he, Alan Stone,  and Edward\r\n\nIntinarelli  pooled their resources and shared their contacts\r\n\nto form a drug cartel in  1984 for the purpose of  purchasing\r\n\nand selling cocaine and  marijuana.  The cartel was  known as\r\n\n\"Triple X\" or \"XXX.\"  Defendant was a drug supplier for Stone\r\n\nand  Intinarelli.    LaPlante  met with  defendant  \"numerous\r\n\ntimes\" to  further Triple  X's business.   LaPlante explained\r\n\nthat those who  did business  with Triple X  were given  code\r\n\nnames and numbers.   Defendant's  code name was  Max and  his\r\n\ncode number was 86.  After a raid on Intinarelli's house, the\r\n\ncode  numbers were changed in January of 1985 \"to protect the\r\n\nidentities  of  the  suppliers  and  the  customers  and  the\r\n\nemployees.\"  Defendant's new code number was 898.   Defendant\r\n\nwas contacted  through  Fem's  Gas Station  on  Route  35  in\r\n\nFramingham, Massachusetts,  which he owned.   Defendant  told\r\n\nLaPlante  that  he  intended to  use  the  proceeds  from the\r\n\ncocaine sales to build a housing development on a large tract\r\n\nof land he owned and then retire.  LaPlante saw entries about\r\n\ndefendant in a  notebook, used by Intinarelli  to record drug\r\n\ntransactions.\r\n\nPhillip Moore  was an  employee of  Triple X.   His\r\n\nduties  consisted of  holding the  cocaine (\"sitting  on it\")\r\n\nprior to sale,  breaking it up  into small saleable  amounts,\r\n\n              -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nand  delivering it to customers.   He was paid $1,000 a week.\r\n\nMoore introduced defendant to Stone in the spring of 1984; he\r\n\ntold  Stone that  defendant  could supply  him with  cocaine.\r\n\nMoore  testified about  three cocaine  transactions involving\r\n\ndefendant.  All three followed the same format.  Moore parked\r\n\nhis car  unlocked in  a parking  lot.  He  then went  into an\r\n\nadjacent bar.  Defendant subsequently joined him and they had\r\n\na  drink together.  Within a short time, defendant would tell\r\n\nMoore that he should leave.   Moore would then leave the  bar\r\n\nand get  into his car.   Each time  this scenario was  played\r\n\nout, there was  a package of cocaine wrapped in  duct tape on\r\n\nthe back seat of the car.  Moore took the cocaine back to the\r\n\n\"safe\"  house where  he weighed  and tested  it.   Moore then\r\n\n\"sat\"  on the  cocaine  until he  received instructions  from\r\n\nStone.  He then broke it up into small amounts  and delivered\r\n\nit to customers.  \r\n\nChristine  Lenhard  testified  under  a   grant  of\r\n\nabsolute immunity.  She worked for Triple X as a \"mule\";  she\r\n\ndelivered cocaine to purchasers and picked up the money.  She\r\n\nwas  paid $1,000 a  week by Triple  X.   She was romantically\r\n\ninvolved with defendant.  The Triple X partners that she knew\r\n\npersonally  were  LaPlante  and  Intinarelli.   Lenhard  knew\r\n\ndefendant's  code name  and  number.   She  knew, based  upon\r\n\nobservations  and  her  work  for Triple  X,  that  defendant\r\n\nsupplied the cartel with cocaine.\r\n\n              -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nDonna Dinallo-Beane also testified under a grant of\r\n\nabsolute immunity.  She lived with LaPlante during Triple X's\r\n\noperations and, like Lenhard,  was employed by Triple X  as a\r\n\n\"mule.\"    She  knew  beyond doubt  that  defendant  supplied\r\n\ncocaine to Triple X.\r\n\nBased   upon  the   evidence  and   the  reasonable\r\n\ninferences  to  be  drawn  from  it,  we  find  that  it  was\r\n\nsufficient  to   sustain   defendant's  conviction   on   the\r\n\nconspiracy count.\r\n\n4.

Listed in  this column to  correspond with\r\n\nthe  count and  date  columns are  amounts  in kilograms  and\r\n\ngrams.   Defendant was  charged in Counts  Twenty-Two through\r\n\nForty-Five  with  possessing  with intent  to  distribute and\r\n\ndistributing specific amounts of cocaine on specific dates.\r\n\nThe jury found defendant not guilty on Count Forty-\r\n\nFive, but  did not return  any verdicts on  Counts Twenty-Two\r\n\nthrough Forty-Four.   In effect, there was a hung  jury as to\r\n\nthese counts.   The  government moved that  Counts Twenty-Two\r\n\nthrough Forty-Four be dismissed without prejudice.  Defendant\r                                                   \r\n\nobjected and moved for  judgment of acquittal on the  counts,\r\n\nor,  in   the  alternative,  that  they   be  dismissed  with\r                                                                         \r\n\nprejudice.

The\r\n\ntrial judge stated:\r\n\n   Defendant's assertion  as to\r\nCounts   22   through   44   is\r\nsimilarly  unpersuasive.     He\r\ninsists    that    since    the\r\ngovernment  offered   the  same\r\nproof for Counts 22  through 44\r\nas for Count  45 --  LaPlante's\r\ntestimony  and certain  ledgers\r\nhe  maintained  --  it  was  an\r\naberration  that  the jury  did\r\nnot acquit him on  those counts\r\nas   well.      In  fact,   the\r\ngovernment   did   not   simply\r\nduplicate the evidence for each\r\ncount.   Although  LaPlante was\r\nthe  key  witness  as   to  all\r\nsubstantive    charges,    each\r\ncharge  reflected  a   separate\r\ntransaction  and  corresponding\r\nentry  in  the  ledger and  the\r\ntestimony    was,    in   fact,\r\ndifferent as to each.   Matters\r\nof credibility are for the jury\r\nand   it   may   believe   some\r\nportions    of   a    witness's\r\ntestimony     and    disbelieve\r\nothers.

The  Court pointed\r\n\nout the obvious:  \"The testing of the effect of the dismissal\r\n\norder  must  abide  petitioner's  trial, and  only  then,  if\r\n\nconvicted will he have been aggrieved.\"  Id. at 517.\r                                                        \r\n\nIn United  States v.

Sec. 841(a)(1).  Defendant forwards four issues on appeal which we consider seriatim.  We affirm defendant's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>1. The Alleged Violation of the Jencks Act--18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual basis for this issue is the accidental destruction of certain tape recordings by a DEA agent.  This is the second time we have been called upon to decide the legal consequences of the destruction of the tape recordings.  Some historical exegesis is necessary, most of which is taken from our prior opinion, United States v. Femia, 9 F.3d 990 (1st Cir.1993) (\"Femia I \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An indictment against defendant and eight other alleged co-conspirators was filed in the district court on October 3, 1986.  Femia was not arrested until July 16, 1992.  The facts relevant to the tape recordings can be summarized as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cristopher LaPlante was the bookkeeper and one of the founding members of a large-scale cocaine operation, known as Triple X.  The DEA started investigating Triple X in 1985.  LaPlante entered into a plea bargain with the DEA.  As part of the plea agreement, LaPlante covertly made twenty-four tape recordings of conversations he had with co-conspirators or customers of Triple X.  The DEA set up three files for three of the alleged co-conspirators, Perea, Stone, and Femia.  The LaPlante tapes were physically stored in the Perea file, which was cross-referenced to the other two files.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial of Femia's alleged co-conspirators was held in 1987.  At this time Femia was still at large.  The eight defendants were convicted either by trial or guilty pleas.  Subsequent to those convictions, a DEA agent, newly-assigned to the case, authorized the destruction of all the LaPlante tapes contained in the Perea file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his arrest and arraignment, Femia moved to suppress the testimony of LaPlante, a key government witness, on the ground that the destruction of the tapes violated his constitutional right to due process as annunciated in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).  The district court granted Femia's motion to suppress.  The government appealed.  We reversed the district court, finding that there was no due process violation because the tapes were \"not destroyed in bad faith.\"  Femia I, 9 F.3d at 994.   We also pointed out that the district court had made no bad faith finding relative to the destruction of the tapes.  Id. at 996.   After remand, the case was tried.  The district court rejected Femia's claim that the destruction of the tapes was a violation of the Jencks Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our analysis of this issue by quoting the district court's written rejection of defendant's Jencks Act claim:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also contends that judgment of acquittal as to Count 1 is appropriate because the government violated the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500.  He bases this claim on the government's destruction of tape recordings made by its key witness, Cristopher LaPlante, and allegedly containing statements amounting to Jencks material.  The Jencks Act provides that a court shall, upon defendant's request, order the government to produce statements made by its witness which relate to the witness's testimony.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500 (1970).  Such statements may be used solely for impeachment purposes.  Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 349 [79 S.Ct. 1217, 1223, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287] (1959).  Defendant speculates that the tapes revealed the identities of large scale drug suppliers, thereby containing statements related to LaPlante's testimony.  Because the tapes were destroyed I cannot review them and thus assess whether they fall within the purview of the Jencks Act.  The record does not, however, require me to make the \"dubious\" inquiry of \"reconstruct[ing] a [tape] no longer in existence using 'the very witness whose testimony the defendant seeks to impeach.' \"  United States v. Carrasco, 537 F.2d 372, 377 (9th Cir.1976) (quoting United States v. Johnson, 521 F.2d 1318, 1320 (9th Cir.1975)).  Here, the affidavits of Agent Reilly and Detective Kinder, which stated that the missing tapes \"contained general conversations that were not specifically relevant to the Triple X investigation,\" support the ruling at trial that the missing tapes were not \"Jencks Act materials with respect to the matters about which the government inquired on direct....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's ruling for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Augenblick, 393 U.S. 348, 89 S.Ct. 528, 21 L.Ed.2d 537 (1969).  Augenblick involved, inter alia, missing tapes that were, without doubt, covered by the Jencks Act.  The Court held that the ruling by the law officer and Board of Review that the tapes need not be produced under the Jencks Act was not an abuse of discretion.  Id. at 355, 89 S.Ct. at 533.   In Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959), the Court held that the final decision as to production of Jencks Act statements \"must rest ... within the good sense and experience of the district judge....\"  Id. at 353, 79 S.Ct. at 1225.   In United States v. Foley, 871 F.2d 235, 239 (1st Cir.1989), we found not clearly erroneous the district court's ruling that so-called \"302's\" were not statements covered by the Jencks Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent parts of the Jencks Act provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination, the court shall, on motion of the defendant, order the United States to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.  If the entire contents of any such statement relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order it to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"statement\", as used in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section in relation to any witness called by the United States, means--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C.

On the other hand, the missing tape observation we made in Femia I is a strong indication that the tapes did not contain Jencks Act statements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>The evidence before the district court showed that any missing evidence--whether one considers allegedly missing fragments of the tapes for which copies exist or those tapes which no longer exist in any form--did not possess exculpatory value apparent before law enforcement destroyed the tapes.  Agent Reilly and Detective Kinder provided affidavits stating that the destroyed tapes contained no references to Femia, his code names or numbers.  Agent Reilly also explained that any tape containing references to Femia would have been transcribed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Femia I, 9 F.3d at 995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the facts and the applicable law, we rule that the district court neither abused its discretion nor clearly erred in finding and ruling as it did.  We think its decision was clearly correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>2. Whether the Supplemental Jury Instruction on Conspiracy Was Reversible Error</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only way to understand this issue is to replicate what happened.  After deliberating for sometime, the jury submitted two written questions to the judge.  She responded as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Members of the jury, let me respond to your note, do it one at a time, and so I will state for the record, for Mr. Laughlin, each question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Question 1 is:  Restate the charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I interpret that to mean the accusations against Mr. Femia.  I assume that's what you meant, that you didn't wish me to give you the instructions all over again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two sets of charges.  Count 1 accuses the defendant of having been a member of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.  That's Count 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two--there's one entirely separate set of charges, Counts 22 through 45, that accuse the defendant of having possessed on specific dates, specific amounts of cocaine with the intent to distribute that cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That's the second set of charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, let me go back for a moment and explain again to you each of these.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Count 1, the conspiracy charge, the government has to prove, first, that there was an agreement between two or more people, not necessarily Mr. Femia, could have been anybody.  The indictment names some people, but any two people, that there was an agreement between any two people to distribute cocaine.  That's the first thing it has to prove.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second thing it has to prove is that Mr. Femia at some point, while this agreement, this conspiracy was in existence, willfully, that is, with an intent to violate the law, became a member of that conspiracy.  That's what the government has to prove.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The second question was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>In Count 1, is paragraph 1 the summation of charges against Mr. Femia, or is paragraph 2b (Count 1) part of the summation of charges or simply an explanation of charges in Counts 22-45.  Specifically--is the defendant charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine or conspiracy to distribute the specific 47 kilograms named in paragraph 2b.  (Id.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judge answered the question thus:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now you also inquired about Paragraph 2B[b] in this indictment.  The conspiracy charge sets out, in general, what the conspiracy was all about.  It then goes on in Paragraph 2 to describe, in general, the role that various of the defendants played in this conspiracy.  And then it goes on in Paragraph 3 and its various sub parts to say what the purpose of this, the object of this conspiracy was.  And it kind of goes on and on and on about that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Paragraph 2B[b], the government says what it--what it says Mr. Femia did.  But in your deliberating on your verdict and deciding this case, you should base, base your verdict not on what the indictment says, but on all of the evidence.  Taking all of the evidence, you need to decide what Mr. Femia did, what Mr. Femia knew, what the circumstances were.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And then based on all of that, all the evidence in the case, what the witnesses told you, what the exhibits tell you, did he willfully become a member of the conspiracy?   And specifically did the government prove and convince you that beyond a reasonable doubt that he--there was this agreement and that he willfully became a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first paragraph of Count One of the indictment charged nine named persons including Femia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>defendants herein, did knowingly and intentionally combine, conspire, confederate and agree with each other, ... and with other persons to commit an offense against the United States, namely to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute, quantities of cocaine, a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 2b of Count One of the indictment states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Defendant Noel Femia also supplied large quantities of cocaine to Triple X.  From July 1984 to April 1985, defendant Noel Femia caused the delivery of approximately forty-seven kilograms of cocaine, having an aggregate wholesale value of nearly two million dollars, to Triple X on consignment.  Following delivery, this cocaine was sold and distributed by members and associates of Triple X.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By now it is axiomatic \"that a single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\"  Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973).  In this connection we note that defendant did not object to the original conspiracy charge which was, of course, more extensive and detailed than the supplemental one, but basically conveyed the same message.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult for us to understand exactly the basis for defendant's contention that the supplemental instruction was erroneous.  It might be inferred from defendant's brief that he is arguing that the jury should have been instructed that in order to convict Femia on the conspiracy count, the government had to prove the overt acts alleged in paragraph 2b.  At the sidebar colloquy after the supplemental instructions were given, the judge asked defense counsel:  \"What do you want me to tell them?\"   Counsel replied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>MR. CARROLL:  This is what I want you to say, Judge.  I want you to say that Paragraph 2B[b] is what the government has accused Mr. Femia of doing.  That's what they said he did in this conspiracy, that was his role in the conspiracy, and the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that is what he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge quite correctly pointed out:  \"No.  That's not the law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court unanimously held in United States v. Shabani, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 382, 383, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994), that 21 U.S.C. Sec. 848 does not require the government to prove that a conspirator committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  We do not think that United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994), is of any help to defendant.  In Sepulveda we held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the challenged convictions center around a charge of conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine.  To prove a drug conspiracy charge under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846, the government is obliged to show beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed and that a particular defendant agreed to participate in it, intending to commit the underlying substantive offense (here, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C.

Cristopher (Cris) LaPlante, the chief witness for the prosecution, testified that he, Alan Stone, and Edward Intinarelli pooled their resources and shared their contacts to form a drug cartel in 1984 for the purpose of purchasing and selling cocaine and marijuana.  The cartel was known as \"Triple X\" or \"XXX.\"   Defendant was a drug supplier for Stone and Intinarelli.  LaPlante met with defendant \"numerous times\" to further Triple X's business.  LaPlante explained that those who did business with Triple X were given code names and numbers.  Defendant's code name was Max and his code number was 86.  After a raid on Intinarelli's house, the code numbers were changed in January of 1985 \"to protect the identities of the suppliers and the customers and the employees.\"   Defendant's new code number was 898.  Defendant was contacted through Fem's Gas Station on Route 35 in Framingham, Massachusetts, which he owned.  Defendant told LaPlante that he intended to use the proceeds from the cocaine sales to build a housing development on a large tract of land he owned and then retire.  LaPlante saw entries about defendant in a notebook, used by Intinarelli to record drug transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillip Moore was an employee of Triple X.  His duties consisted of holding the cocaine (\"sitting on it\") prior to sale, breaking it up into small saleable amounts, and delivering it to customers.  He was paid $1,000 a week.  Moore introduced defendant to Stone in the spring of 1984;  he told Stone that defendant could supply him with cocaine.  Moore testified about three cocaine transactions involving defendant.  All three followed the same format.  Moore parked his car unlocked in a parking lot.  He then went into an adjacent bar.  Defendant subsequently joined him and they had a drink together.  Within a short time, defendant would tell Moore that he should leave.  Moore would then leave the bar and get into his car.  Each time this scenario was played out, there was a package of cocaine wrapped in duct tape on the back seat of the car.  Moore took the cocaine back to the \"safe\" house where he weighed and tested it.  Moore then \"sat\" on the cocaine until he received instructions from Stone.  He then broke it up into small amounts and delivered it to customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Christine Lenhard testified under a grant of absolute immunity.  She worked for Triple X as a \"mule\";  she delivered cocaine to purchasers and picked up the money.  She was paid $1,000 a week by Triple X.  She was romantically involved with defendant.  The Triple X partners that she knew personally were LaPlante and Intinarelli.  Lenhard knew defendant's code name and number.

The first column is entitled \"Count\" and under it are listed in chronological order the words \"Twenty-Two\" through \"Forty-Five.\"   The second column is headed \"DATE\" and opposite each numbered count are specific dates starting with \"July 24, 1984\" opposite \"Twenty-Two\" and ending with \"March 22, 1985\" opposite \"Forty-Five.\"   The third column is entitled \"Amount\" \"(approximate\").  Listed in this column to correspond with the count and date columns are amounts in kilograms and grams.  Defendant was charged in Counts Twenty-Two through Forty-Five with possessing with intent to distribute and distributing specific amounts of cocaine on specific dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found defendant not guilty on Count Forty-Five, but did not return any verdicts on Counts Twenty-Two through Forty-Four.  In effect, there was a hung jury as to these counts.  The government moved that Counts Twenty-Two through Forty-Four be dismissed without prejudice.  Defendant objected and moved for judgment of acquittal on the counts, or, in the alternative, that they be dismissed with prejudice.  A hearing was held.  The district court granted the government's motion and denied defendant's motions.  The trial judge stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's assertion as to Counts 22 through 44 is similarly unpersuasive.  He insists that since the government offered the same proof for Counts 22 through 44 as for Count 45--LaPlante's testimony and certain ledgers he maintained--it was an aberration that the jury did not acquit him on those counts as well.  In fact, the government did not simply duplicate the evidence for each count.  Although LaPlante was the key witness as to all substantive charges, each charge reflected a separate transaction and corresponding entry in the ledger and the testimony was, in fact, different as to each.  Matters of credibility are for the jury and it may believe some portions of a witness's testimony and disbelieve others.  United States v. Jackson, 778 F.2d 933, 942 (2d Cir.1985) (upholding instruction that \"jurors are not required to reject or accept any particular witness's testimony in toto.\")   Since the evidence, if believed, was sufficient to sustain convictions as to Counts 22 through 44, judgment of acquittal is inappropriate.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).  Defendant's renewed motion for judgment of acquittal is therefore denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing I allowed the government's motion to dismiss without prejudice these same counts (Counts 22-44).  For the reasons outlined, defendant's alternative motion to dismiss with prejudice is also denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law holds squarely that a defendant does not have standing to appeal a without-prejudice dismissal of an indictment.

United States, 351 U.S. 513, 516-18, 76 S.Ct. 912, 915-16, 100 L.Ed. 1377 (1956), the Court held that a defendant does not have standing to appeal the dismissal of an indictment because he is not legally aggrieved by such action.  The Court pointed out the obvious:  \"The testing of the effect of the dismissal order must abide petitioner's trial, and only then, if convicted will he have been aggrieved.\"  Id. at 517, 76 S.Ct. at 915.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

Femia was not arrested until July 16, 1992.  The facts relevant to the tape recordings can be summarized as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cristopher LaPlante was the bookkeeper and one of the founding members of a large-scale cocaine operation, known as Triple X.  The DEA started investigating Triple X in 1985.  LaPlante entered into a plea bargain with the DEA.  As part of the plea agreement, LaPlante covertly made twenty-four tape recordings of conversations he had with co-conspirators or customers of Triple X.  The DEA set up three files for three of the alleged co-conspirators, Perea, Stone, and Femia.  The LaPlante tapes were physically stored in the Perea file, which was cross-referenced to the other two files.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial of Femia's alleged co-conspirators was held in 1987.  At this time Femia was still at large.  The eight defendants were convicted either by trial or guilty pleas.  Subsequent to those convictions, a DEA agent, newly-assigned to the case, authorized the destruction of all the LaPlante tapes contained in the Perea file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his arrest and arraignment, Femia moved to suppress the testimony of LaPlante, a key government witness, on the ground that the destruction of the tapes violated his constitutional right to due process as annunciated in Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Sec. 3500.  He bases this claim on the government's destruction of tape recordings made by its key witness, Cristopher LaPlante, and allegedly containing statements amounting to Jencks material.  The Jencks Act provides that a court shall, upon defendant's request, order the government to produce statements made by its witness which relate to the witness's testimony.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500 (1970).  Such statements may be used solely for impeachment purposes.  Palermo v.

Defendant speculates that the tapes revealed the identities of large scale drug suppliers, thereby containing statements related to LaPlante's testimony.  Because the tapes were destroyed I cannot review them and thus assess whether they fall within the purview of the Jencks Act.  The record does not, however, require me to make the \"dubious\" inquiry of \"reconstruct[ing] a [tape] no longer in existence using 'the very witness whose testimony the defendant seeks to impeach.' \"  United States v.

Count 1 accuses the defendant of having been a member of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.  That's Count 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two--there's one entirely separate set of charges, Counts 22 through 45, that accuse the defendant of having possessed on specific dates, specific amounts of cocaine with the intent to distribute that cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That's the second set of charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, let me go back for a moment and explain again to you each of these.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Count 1, the conspiracy charge, the government has to prove, first, that there was an agreement between two or more people, not necessarily Mr. Femia, could have been anybody.  The indictment names some people, but any two people, that there was an agreement between any two people to distribute cocaine.  That's the first thing it has to prove.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second thing it has to prove is that Mr. Femia at some point, while this agreement, this conspiracy was in existence, willfully, that is, with an intent to violate the law, became a member of that conspiracy.  That's what the government has to prove.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The second question was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>In Count 1, is paragraph 1 the summation of charges against Mr. Femia, or is paragraph 2b (Count 1) part of the summation of charges or simply an explanation of charges in Counts 22-45.  Specifically--is the defendant charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine or conspiracy to distribute the specific 47 kilograms named in paragraph 2b.  (Id.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judge answered the question thus:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now you also inquired about Paragraph 2B[b] in this indictment.  The conspiracy charge sets out, in general, what the conspiracy was all about.  It then goes on in Paragraph 2 to describe, in general, the role that various of the defendants played in this conspiracy.  And then it goes on in Paragraph 3 and its various sub parts to say what the purpose of this, the object of this conspiracy was.  And it kind of goes on and on and on about that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Paragraph 2B[b], the government says what it--what it says Mr. Femia did.  But in your deliberating on your verdict and deciding this case, you should base, base your verdict not on what the indictment says, but on all of the evidence.  Taking all of the evidence, you need to decide what Mr. Femia did, what Mr. Femia knew, what the circumstances were.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And then based on all of that, all the evidence in the case, what the witnesses told you, what the exhibits tell you, did he willfully become a member of the conspiracy?   And specifically did the government prove and convince you that beyond a reasonable doubt that he--there was this agreement and that he willfully became a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first paragraph of Count One of the indictment charged nine named persons including Femia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>defendants herein, did knowingly and intentionally combine, conspire, confederate and agree with each other, ... and with other persons to commit an offense against the United States, namely to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute, quantities of cocaine, a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 2b of Count One of the indictment states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Cristopher (Cris) LaPlante, the chief witness for the prosecution, testified that he, Alan Stone, and Edward Intinarelli pooled their resources and shared their contacts to form a drug cartel in 1984 for the purpose of purchasing and selling cocaine and marijuana.  The cartel was known as \"Triple X\" or \"XXX.\"   Defendant was a drug supplier for Stone and Intinarelli.  LaPlante met with defendant \"numerous times\" to further Triple X's business.  LaPlante explained that those who did business with Triple X were given code names and numbers.  Defendant's code name was Max and his code number was 86.  After a raid on Intinarelli's house, the code numbers were changed in January of 1985 \"to protect the identities of the suppliers and the customers and the employees.\"   Defendant's new code number was 898.  Defendant was contacted through Fem's Gas Station on Route 35 in Framingham, Massachusetts, which he owned.  Defendant told LaPlante that he intended to use the proceeds from the cocaine sales to build a housing development on a large tract of land he owned and then retire.  LaPlante saw entries about defendant in a notebook, used by Intinarelli to record drug transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillip Moore was an employee of Triple X.  His duties consisted of holding the cocaine (\"sitting on it\") prior to sale, breaking it up into small saleable amounts, and delivering it to customers.  He was paid $1,000 a week.  Moore introduced defendant to Stone in the spring of 1984;  he told Stone that defendant could supply him with cocaine.  Moore testified about three cocaine transactions involving defendant.  All three followed the same format.  Moore parked his car unlocked in a parking lot.  He then went into an adjacent bar.  Defendant subsequently joined him and they had a drink together.  Within a short time, defendant would tell Moore that he should leave.  Moore would then leave the bar and get into his car.  Each time this scenario was played out, there was a package of cocaine wrapped in duct tape on the back seat of the car.  Moore took the cocaine back to the \"safe\" house where he weighed and tested it.  Moore then \"sat\" on the cocaine until he received instructions from Stone.  He then broke it up into small amounts and delivered it to customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Christine Lenhard testified under a grant of absolute immunity.  She worked for Triple X as a \"mule\";  she delivered cocaine to purchasers and picked up the money.  She was paid $1,000 a week by Triple X.  She was romantically involved with defendant.  The Triple X partners that she knew personally were LaPlante and Intinarelli.  Lenhard knew defendant's code name and number.  She knew, based upon observations and her work for Triple X, that defendant supplied the cartel with cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donna Dinallo-Beane also testified under a grant of absolute immunity.

In effect, there was a hung jury as to these counts.  The government moved that Counts Twenty-Two through Forty-Four be dismissed without prejudice.  Defendant objected and moved for judgment of acquittal on the counts, or, in the alternative, that they be dismissed with prejudice.  A hearing was held.  The district court granted the government's motion and denied defendant's motions.  The trial judge stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's assertion as to Counts 22 through 44 is similarly unpersuasive.  He insists that since the government offered the same proof for Counts 22 through 44 as for Count 45--LaPlante's testimony and certain ledgers he maintained--it was an aberration that the jury did not acquit him on those counts as well.  In fact, the government did not simply duplicate the evidence for each count.  Although LaPlante was the key witness as to all substantive charges, each charge reflected a separate transaction and corresponding entry in the ledger and the testimony was, in fact, different as to each.  Matters of credibility are for the jury and it may believe some portions of a witness's testimony and disbelieve others.  United States v.

See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).  Defendant's renewed motion for judgment of acquittal is therefore denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing I allowed the government's motion to dismiss without prejudice these same counts (Counts 22-44).
