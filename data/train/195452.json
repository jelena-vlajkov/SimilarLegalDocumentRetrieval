Oscar Anibal  Tillett appeals  the\n                    \n\ndismissal of his motion under 28 U.S.C.   2255.  We affirm.  \n\n          In this case, the magistrate recommended dismissing\n\nTillett's section 2255 petition on the ground that he had not\n\nexcused a double procedural default  -- his failure to object\n\nat sentencing to  a fine imposed on him by  the court and his\n\nfailure  to  appeal  his  sentence.1   Tillett  submitted  an\n\nobjection to  the  magistrate's report  alleging  ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel  as cause  for his failure  to file  an\n\nappeal.   Tillett said that he had asked his attorney to file\n\na direct appeal, that his attorney had promised to do so, and\n\nthat Tillett later discovered that  his attorney had not done\n\nso.   The  district court  accepted the  magistrate's report,\n\nwithout referring specifically to Tillett's objection.  \n\n                    \n\n1.   We note a problem in the magistrate's report.  The final\nsentence  of  the  report  states  that  \"[f]ailure  to  file\nspecific objections  in a timely manner  constitutes a waiver\nof  the  right  to  review by  the  district  court.\"   In  a\nfootnote, the magistrate cites Park Motor Mart,  Inc. v. Ford\n                                                             \nMotor Co., 616 F.2d 603 (1st Cir. 1980), and United States v.\n                                                          \nValencia-Copete,  792 F.2d  4  (1st Cir.  1986).   The  final\n               \nsentence in  the magistrate's  report  accurately states  our\nholding  in Park Motor, but does not encompass our holding in\n                      \nValencia-Copete.   In that case, we  directed all magistrates\n               \nto include in their  reports a notice that failure  to timely\nobject  to  a report  would waive  \"the  right to  appeal the\n                                                             \ndistrict court's decision.\"  792  F.2d at 6 (emphasis added).\n                         \nWe  note that  a different  Rhode Island  magistrate's report\nincluded in the record  is similarly deficient.  Accordingly,\nwe remind  all magistrates in Rhode Island that their reports\nmust  include the  statement  that failure  to file  specific\nobjections  to  reports in  a timely  manner waives  both the\nright to review by the district court and the right to appeal\nthe district court's decision.\n\n                             -2-\n\n          On appeal, Tillett has  not objected to the court's\n\nfailure to  address  his ineffective  assistance  of  counsel\n\nclaim,  and he  has  not presented  that claim  to  us as  an\n\nappellate ground  for relief.  Indeed,  his initial appellate\n\nbrief says  nothing about ineffective assistance of counsel.2\n\nIt is  well  established  that  arguments not  raised  in  an\n\ninitial  appellate brief  are generally  deemed waived.   See\n                                                             \n\nPlayboy Enterprises v.  Public Service  Commission of  Puerto\n                                                             \n\nRico, 906 F.2d 25, 40 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 498 U.S. 959\n                                               \n\n(1990).  \n\n          We  see no  reason why  we  should not  follow that\n\nprinciple  here.  On this record, it is abundantly clear that\n\nTillett has  long known that he  had the right  to appeal his\n\nsentence  and that it was  his failure to  appeal that barred\n\nhim from obtaining collateral relief.  It is also clear that,\n\nbefore bringing  the present appeal, Tillett  must have known\n\n                    \n\n2.  Tillett's   reply  brief  makes   only  the  inconsistent\nassertion  that his counsel never  even told him  that he had\nthe  right to appeal  his sentence and  that he  did not know\nthat  he  could  appeal  after   having  pled  guilty.    The\nsentencing  transcript  shows  that  the  court  itself  told\nTillett at sentencing  that he  had the right  to appeal  his\nsentence, and  that counsel  would be appointed  to represent\nhim  if  necessary.    Thus,  the  new  claim  on  appeal  is\nconclusively refuted  by the record,  and does not  provide a\nbasis  for relief.  We  note that Tillett's  reply brief also\nsuggested that he was in  a state of shock at  his sentencing\nbecause  an agreement to treat the charges against him in New\nYork  and Rhode  Island  in the  same  proceeding had  fallen\nthrough.  This is a new claim which was not  presented to the\ndistrict court, and so  we decline to consider it  on appeal.\nSee United States v.  Ocasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d 1, 3  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n1993). \n\n                             -3-\n\nthat  ineffective assistance  by his  attorney was  a legally\n\nsignificant  factor  in  determining  his  right   to  obtain\n\ncollateral relief.  As already  noted, the court told Tillett\n\nat sentencing that he had the \"right\" to appeal his sentence.\n\nTillett knew by  the time he filed  a previous postconviction\n\nmotion for relief in 1991 that his  attorney had not done so.\n\nThe  dismissal of that motion  was grounded on  the fact that\n\nTillett  had not  filed an  appeal.   Tillett then  filed his\n                \n\nsection 2255 action with the help of a prison paralegal.  The\n\nform  he used stated that  failure to allege  all grounds for\n\nrelief could  mean that  those grounds would  be barred  from\n\nbeing  presented  at a  later  date;  it specifically  listed\n\n\"denial of  effective assistance  of counsel\" and  \"denial of\n\nright of appeal\"  as commonly cited grounds  for section 2255\n\nrelief.  Furthermore, the magistrate's report made clear that\n\nTillett's unexplained failure to  appeal his sentence was one\n                     \n\nreason why collateral relief was not available.  Against this\n\nbackdrop, we  need not  look beyond  the  issues Tillett  has\n\npresented to us on  appeal to decide his case.   Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude  that Tillett has voluntarily  waived any Bonneau\n                                                             \n\nclaim he  may have had.   See Bonneau  v. United States,  961\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 17,  23 (1st Cir. 1992)  (where there was no  doubt that\n\nappellant  was deprived of his right of appeal because of the\n\ndereliction of counsel, a section 2255 petitioner had a right\n\n                             -4-\n\nto take a direct appeal without first showing that the issues\n\non appeal would be meritorious).\n\n          In the interests of judicial economy, therefore, we\n\nproceed to evaluate  the merits of  his section 2255  claims,\n\nand  affirm  the district  court  because  those claims  lack\n\nmerit.    The sentencing  court's  failure  to make  specific\n\nfindings of fact in support of its decision to impose a  fine\n\nprovides  no basis  for  granting collateral  relief in  this\n\ncircuit.   See United States  v. Savoie, 917  F.2d 1057, 1064\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).  The sentencing  transcript also makes clear\n\nthat  the court did consider Tillett's ability to pay a fine.\n\nThe  court acknowledged that a fine of $20,000 per count (for\n\na total  of $60,000 on the three counts to which Tillett pled\n\nguilty)  seemed \"somewhat  out  of line\"  with the  financial\n\nstatement  in the presentence report.   But it suggested that\n\nother facts given  in the report indicated that the financial\n\nstatement did not accurately reflect Tillett's actual assets.\n\n          Contrary to what  Tillett suggests, the presentence\n\nreport did not conclude that he had no ability to pay a fine.\n\nMoreover,  it contains  sufficient  evidence  to support  the\n\ncourt's  imposition of a total  fine of $60,000.   The report\n\nstated that Tillett had admitted that he had received $17,225\n\nfor heroin  sold to a single  Drug Enforcement Administration\n\nagent in Rhode Island in the nine-month period  preceding his\n\narrest.   The  agent  gave an  additional  $2,500 to  one  of\n\n                             -5-\n\nTillett's   co-defendants,  Luis   Cepeda,  who,   the  court\n\ndetermined  at  sentencing,  was  a runner  for  Tillett  who\n\ncollected money  from heroin purchasers  on Tillett's behalf.\n\nThe presentence report also indicates that, two months before\n\nhis  arrest,  Tillett  had  arranged  to  sell  heroin  \"that\n\nweekend\"  to the  DEA agent  for $35,000-$37,500,  suggesting\n\nthat  Tillett already had the heroin available, or that he at\n\nleast had  ready access to it.   The sale did  not go through\n\nbecause  the government  backed  out;  it  did  not  want  to\n\njeopardize  a  separate  investigation  into  Tillett's  drug\n\ntrafficking activities  in New  York.3  The  court reasonably\n\ncould have inferred that  Tillett eventually sold that heroin\n\nto other  parties and that he  had received up  to $37,500 in\n\nillegal  drug sale  proceeds  in the  two months  immediately\n\npreceding  his   arrest.    Thus,  the   information  in  the\n\npresentence report  permitted the  court to conclude  that in\n\nthe  nine-month  period  preceding  Tillett's  arrest  he had\n\nreceived up to $57,225  in proceeds from the sale  of heroin.\n\nAs  the  report says,  Tillett also  had  over $3,000  in his\n\nchecking and savings accounts,  and so we have no  doubt that\n\nthe  court did not abuse  its discretion in  imposing a total\n\nfine  of $60,000 on Tillett, and in not deferring its payment\n\nuntil after his release from prison.  \n\n                    \n\n3.  The presentence report noted that Tillett had pled guilty\nin  New York  district court  to one  count of  conspiracy to\npossess with intent to distribute heroin.  \n\n                             -6-\n\n          The district court knew that Tillett was engaged in\n\ndrug trafficking in both  Rhode Island and New York,  and the\n\npresentence report does not suggest that Tillett's activities\n\nwere limited  to a few, isolated sales  of heroin.  The court\n\nconcluded at sentencing that Tillett was the organizer of the\n\ndrug conspiracy in  which he  was involved, and  that he  had\n\nrecruited  others to join that  conspiracy.  In addition, the\n\npresentence report indicated  that Tillett had been  arrested\n\nbefore on the charge that he had possessed heroin with intent\n\nto deliver.  Accordingly, the court would have been justified\n\nin  concluding  that  the  specific  sums  mentioned  in  the\n\npresentence report,  which reflected  only several actual  or\n\npotential  sales to a single  DEA agent in  Rhode Island, did\n\nnot  reflect the  total amount  of Tillett's  illegal income.\n\nFurthermore,  before  his  arrest,  Tillett  had  had  steady\n\nemployment  with  the same  employer  for 17  years,  had net\n\nmonthly  income of  $2,240  and monthly  expenses of  $1,492,\n\nleaving him with  a net monthly surplus of  $748.  From this,\n\nthe court could have inferred that Tillett's income from drug\n\nsales was  not  used for  his  living expenses  (and  Tillett\n\nsuggests as much in his reply brief).  \n\n          The financial statement  in the presentence  report\n\nshowed that Tillett's combined checking and  savings accounts\n\ncontained  some  $3,136,  that  his  liabilities  were   some\n\n$11,523, so that he had a negative net worth of approximately\n\n                             -7-\n\n$8,386.  In view of the facts recited above, however, and the\n\nfact  that Tillett had retained counsel to represent him, the\n\ncourt  could  reasonably  have  concluded that  the  sums  in\n\nTillett's  bank accounts reflected only his legitimate income\n\nand not what his total financial resources were.  Under these\n\ncircumstances, and  given the fact  that the court  imposed a\n\nfine  at  the  lower end  of  the  applicable  fine range  of\n\n$12,500-$1,000,000,  we  think  that  there   was  sufficient\n\nevidence  to support  the  court's imposition  of  a fine  of\n\n$20,000 per count on Tillett.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -8-\n",

Oscar Anibal  Tillett appeals  the\n                    \n\ndismissal of his motion under 28 U.S.C.   2255.  We affirm.  \n\n          In this case, the magistrate recommended dismissing\n\nTillett's section 2255 petition on the ground that he had not\n\nexcused a double procedural default  -- his failure to object\n\nat sentencing to  a fine imposed on him by  the court and his\n\nfailure  to  appeal  his  sentence.1   Tillett  submitted  an\n\nobjection to  the  magistrate's report  alleging  ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel  as cause  for his failure  to file  an\n\nappeal.   Tillett said that he had asked his attorney to file\n\na direct appeal, that his attorney had promised to do so, and\n\nthat Tillett later discovered that  his attorney had not done\n\nso.   The  district court  accepted the  magistrate's report,\n\nwithout referring specifically to Tillett's objection.  \n\n                    \n\n1.   We note a problem in the magistrate's report.

In that case, we  directed all magistrates\n               \nto include in their  reports a notice that failure  to timely\nobject  to  a report  would waive  \"the  right to  appeal the\n                                                             \ndistrict court's </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471042\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">decision.\"</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/471042/united-states-v-emiliano-valencia-copete/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">6</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(emphasis added).\n                         \nWe  note that  a different  Rhode Island  magistrate's report\nincluded in the record  is similarly deficient.

Indeed,  his initial appellate\n\nbrief says  nothing about ineffective assistance of counsel.2\n\nIt is  well  established  that  arguments not  raised  in  an\n\ninitial  appellate brief  are generally  deemed waived.

On this record, it is abundantly clear that\n\nTillett has  long known that he  had the right  to appeal his\n\nsentence  and that it was  his failure to  appeal that barred\n\nhim from obtaining collateral relief.  It is also clear that,\n\nbefore bringing  the present appeal, Tillett  must have known\n\n                    \n\n2.  Tillett's   reply  brief  makes   only  the  inconsistent\nassertion  that his counsel never  even told him  that he had\nthe  right to appeal  his sentence and  that he  did not know\nthat  he  could  appeal  after   having  pled  guilty.    The\nsentencing  transcript  shows  that  the  court  itself  told\nTillett at sentencing  that he  had the right  to appeal  his\nsentence, and  that counsel  would be appointed  to represent\nhim  if  necessary.    Thus,  the  new  claim  on  appeal  is\nconclusively refuted  by the record,  and does not  provide a\nbasis  for relief.  We  note that Tillett's  reply brief also\nsuggested that he was in  a state of shock at  his sentencing\nbecause  an agreement to treat the charges against him in New\nYork  and Rhode  Island  in the  same  proceeding had  fallen\nthrough.  This is a new claim which was not  presented to the\ndistrict court, and so  we decline to consider it  on appeal.\nSee United States v.  Ocasio-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604815\"><a href=\"/opinion/604815/united-states-v-richard-ocasio-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n1993). \n\n                             -3-\n\nthat  ineffective assistance  by his  attorney was  a legally\n\nsignificant  factor  in  determining  his  right   to  obtain\n\ncollateral relief.  As already  noted, the court told Tillett\n\nat sentencing that he had the \"right\" to appeal his sentence.\n\nTillett knew by  the time he filed  a previous postconviction\n\nmotion for relief in 1991 that his  attorney had not done so.\n\nThe  dismissal of that motion  was grounded on  the fact that\n\nTillett  had not  filed an  appeal.   Tillett then  filed his\n                \n\nsection 2255 action with the help of a prison paralegal.  The\n\nform  he used stated that  failure to allege  all grounds for\n\nrelief could  mean that  those grounds would  be barred  from\n\nbeing  presented  at a  later  date;  it specifically  listed\n\n\"denial of  effective assistance  of counsel\" and  \"denial of\n\nright of appeal\"  as commonly cited grounds  for section 2255\n\nrelief.  Furthermore, the magistrate's report made clear that\n\nTillett's unexplained failure to  appeal his sentence was one\n                     \n\nreason why collateral relief was not available.  Against this\n\nbackdrop, we  need not  look beyond  the  issues Tillett  has\n\npresented to us on  appeal to decide his case.   Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude  that Tillett has voluntarily  waived any Bonneau\n                                                             \n\nclaim he  may have had.   See Bonneau  v.

The sentencing  court's  failure  to make  specific\n\nfindings of fact in support of its decision to impose a  fine\n\nprovides  no basis  for  granting collateral  relief in  this\n\ncircuit.   See United States  v. Savoie, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1064\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).  The sentencing  transcript also makes clear\n\nthat  the court did consider Tillett's ability to pay a fine.\n\nThe  court acknowledged that a fine of $20,000 per count (for\n\na total  of $60,000 on the three counts to which Tillett pled\n\nguilty)  seemed \"somewhat  out  of line\"  with the  financial\n\nstatement  in the presentence report.   But it suggested that\n\nother facts given  in the report indicated that the financial\n\nstatement did not accurately reflect Tillett's actual assets.\n\n          Contrary to what  Tillett suggests, the presentence\n\nreport did not conclude that he had no ability to pay a fine.\n\nMoreover,  it contains  sufficient  evidence  to support  the\n\ncourt's  imposition of a total  fine of $60,000.   The report\n\nstated that Tillett had admitted that he had received $17,225\n\nfor heroin  sold to a single  Drug Enforcement Administration\n\nagent in Rhode Island in the nine-month period  preceding his\n\narrest.   The  agent  gave an  additional  $2,500 to  one  of\n\n                             -5-\n\nTillett's   co-defendants,  Luis   Cepeda,  who,   the  court\n\ndetermined  at  sentencing,  was  a runner  for  Tillett  who\n\ncollected money  from heroin purchasers  on Tillett's behalf.\n\nThe presentence report also indicates that, two months before\n\nhis  arrest,  Tillett  had  arranged  to  sell  heroin  \"that\n\nweekend\"  to the  DEA agent  for $35,000-$37,500,  suggesting\n\nthat  Tillett already had the heroin available, or that he at\n\nleast had  ready access to it.   The sale did  not go through\n\nbecause  the government  backed  out;  it  did  not  want  to\n\njeopardize  a  separate  investigation  into  Tillett's  drug\n\ntrafficking activities  in New  York.3  The  court reasonably\n\ncould have inferred that  Tillett eventually sold that heroin\n\nto other  parties and that he  had received up  to $37,500 in\n\nillegal  drug sale  proceeds  in the  two months  immediately\n\npreceding  his   arrest.    Thus,  the   information  in  the\n\npresentence report  permitted the  court to conclude  that in\n\nthe  nine-month  period  preceding  Tillett's  arrest  he had\n\nreceived up to $57,225  in proceeds from the sale  of heroin.\n\nAs  the  report says,  Tillett also  had  over $3,000  in his\n\nchecking and savings accounts,  and so we have no  doubt that\n\nthe  court did not abuse  its discretion in  imposing a total\n\nfine  of $60,000 on Tillett, and in not deferring its payment\n\nuntil after his release from prison.  \n\n                    \n\n3.  The presentence report noted that Tillett had pled guilty\nin  New York  district court  to one  count of  conspiracy to\npossess with intent to distribute heroin.  \n\n                             -6-\n\n          The district court knew that Tillett was engaged in\n\ndrug trafficking in both  Rhode Island and New York,  and the\n\npresentence report does not suggest that Tillett's activities\n\nwere limited  to a few, isolated sales  of heroin.  The court\n\nconcluded at sentencing that Tillett was the organizer of the\n\ndrug conspiracy in  which he  was involved, and  that he  had\n\nrecruited  others to join that  conspiracy.  In addition, the\n\npresentence report indicated  that Tillett had been  arrested\n\nbefore on the charge that he had possessed heroin with intent\n\nto deliver.  Accordingly, the court would have been justified\n\nin  concluding  that  the  specific  sums  mentioned  in  the\n\npresentence report,  which reflected  only several actual  or\n\npotential  sales to a single  DEA agent in  Rhode Island, did\n\nnot  reflect the  total amount  of Tillett's  illegal income.\n\nFurthermore,  before  his  arrest,  Tillett  had  had  steady\n\nemployment  with  the same  employer  for 17  years,  had net\n\nmonthly  income of  $2,240  and monthly  expenses of  $1,492,\n\nleaving him with  a net monthly surplus of  $748.  From this,\n\nthe court could have inferred that Tillett's income from drug\n\nsales was  not  used for  his  living expenses  (and  Tillett\n\nsuggests as much in his reply brief).  \n\n          The financial statement  in the presentence  report\n\nshowed that Tillett's combined checking and  savings accounts\n\ncontained  some  $3,136,  that  his  liabilities  were   some\n\n$11,523, so that he had a negative net worth of approximately\n\n                             -7-\n\n$8,386.  In view of the facts recited above, however, and the\n\nfact  that Tillett had retained counsel to represent him, the\n\ncourt  could  reasonably  have  concluded that  the  sums  in\n\nTillett's  bank accounts reflected only his legitimate income\n\nand not what his total financial resources were.  Under these\n\ncircumstances, and  given the fact  that the court  imposed a\n\nfine  at  the  lower end  of  the  applicable  fine range  of\n\n$12,500-$1,000,000,  we  think  that  there   was  sufficient\n\nevidence  to support  the  court's imposition  of  a fine  of\n\n$20,000 per count on Tillett.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -8-\n</pre>",
