The National Football League\n                                  \n\nand twenty-one  organizations owning NFL franchises  (referred to\n\ncollectively as  the \"NFL\")  appeal the judgment  entered against\n\nthem  after a jury found that the NFL violated the antitrust laws\n\nby  restricting  owners of  member  football  clubs from  selling\n\nshares in their teams to the public.  Plaintiff-appellee, William\n\nH. Sullivan, former  owner of the  New England Patriots  football\n\nteam  (the \"Patriots\"),  was awarded  a total  of $51  million in\n\ndamages for the losses Sullivan incurred when he had to  sell the\n\nPatriots  to a  private buyer  after the  NFL prevented  him from\n\noffering 49%  of the team to  the public in the  form of publicly\n\ntraded stock.  Because  several prejudicial errors were committed\n\nduring the trial,  we vacate  the judgment and  remand for a  new\n\ntrial.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Under  Article 3.5  of the  NFL's constitution  and by-\n\nlaws,  three-quarters of  the NFL  club  owners must  approve all\n\ntransfers  of ownership  interests  in an  NFL  team, other  than\n\ntransfers within a  family.  In conjunction with this  rule is an\n\nuncodified policy against  the sale of ownership  interests in an\n\nNFL  club to  the  public through  offerings  of publicly  traded\n\nstock.  The  members, however, retain  full authority to  approve\n\nany given transfer by a three-quarters vote  according to Article\n\n3.5.\n\n          Sullivan  owned the Patriots  from the team's inception\n\nin  1959 until  October  of  1988.    When  Sullivan  formed  the\n\n                               -2-\n\nPatriots, he and his  partner sold non-voting shares of  the team\n\nto the public beginning in 1960.  At that time, the Patriots were\n\nin  the old American Football League  (\"AFL\"), which was separate\n\nfrom the NFL, and which had no policy against public ownership of\n\nteams.  In  1966, the AFL and  the old NFL  merged into a  single\n\nleague.  Under  the terms of the merger, the  new NFL would adopt\n\nthe old NFL's  policy against  public ownership.   The  Patriots,\n\nhowever, were allowed  to retain their level of  public ownership\n\nas a special exception to the rule under a grandfather clause.\n\n          In 1976,  Sullivan sought to acquire  the publicly held\n\nshares of  the Patriots through a  merger of the club  into a new\n\nSullivan-owned company.   Stockholders approved  the transfer and\n\nthe  transaction  was  subsequently  consummated,  although  some\n\nshareholders   subsequently   brought   suit,   challenging   the\n\nsufficiency of the purchase  price.  After protracted litigation,\n\nthe shareholders  obtained a  judgment requiring Sullivan  to pay\n\nthem a higher price for their shares.  The Patriots then became a\n\nfully privately owned club.\n\n          Sullivan  and his  son, Chuck  Sullivan, who  owned the\n\nstadium where the Patriots  played, began to experience financial\n\ndifficulties  and increasing debt burdens in  the mid-1980s.  The\n\nSullivans decided that  they needed to raise capital to alleviate\n\ntheir financial problems.   After the Boston Celtics professional\n\nbasketball franchise made a public offering of 40% of the team in\n\nDecember  of 1986, the Sullivans decided to pursue a similar deal\n\nwith the Patriots in order  to raise cash to cover some  of their\n\n                               -3-\n\ndebts.\n\n          On October  19, 1987, the Sullivans  met with Stephens,\n\nInc.,  a small investment banking firm  in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThey discussed a  debt financing deal whereby Stephens would loan\n\nthe  Sullivans  $80  million  dollars,  with  half going  to  the\n\nPatriots  and the  other half  to Chuck Sullivan's  company which\n\nowned the Patriots' stadium.   The Patriots' portion of  the loan\n\nwould  be repaid out  of the proceeds  of the sale of  49% of the\n\nPatriots through the  offering of public stock.   Stephens agreed\n\nto  look into the possibility of arranging the deal, but informed\n\nthe Sullivans that  they would  first have to  get NFL  approval.\n\nSullivan ultimately never obtained NFL approval and the deal with\n\nStephens never progressed beyond some preliminary discussions.\n\n          At a meeting  of the  NFL owners on  October 27,  1987,\n\nSullivan raised his  stock sale  idea with the  other owners  and\n\nasked  for  a modification  of  the NFL's  policy  against public\n\nownership  to  allow for  certain  controlled  sales of  minority\n\ninterests  in NFL  clubs.   Alternatively,  Sullivan requested  a\n\nwaiver  from the  public  ownership policy  for his  contemplated\n\npublic  offering  of  the   Patriots.    Sullivan's  request  was\n\neventually tabled  at this meeting.   Discussions continued among\n\nthe  owners  and, at  one point,  Sullivan counted  17 of  the 21\n\nowners needed for  approval as being in favor  of allowing him to\n\nmake  his public  offering (seven  owners were  still undecided).\n\nPete Rozelle, NFL Commissioner  at the time, told  Sullivans that\n\nhe  was  not in  favor of  Sullivan's  proposals and  that league\n\n                               -4-\n\napproval was \"very dubious.\"  Sullivan ultimately never asked for\n\na vote on amending  the ownership policy or on waiving the policy\n\nfor the Patriots,  and the NFL never held such  a vote.  Sullivan\n\nclaims that he did not ask for a  vote because it would have been\n\nfutile.\n\n          In  October of  1988,  Sullivan sold  the Patriots  for\n\napproximately  $83.7  million to  KMS  Patriots  L.P. (\"KMS\"),  a\n\nlimited  partnership owned  by  Victor Kiam  and Francis  Murray.\n\nSullivan alleges that, absent  the NFL's public ownership policy,\n\nhe  would have been able to retain  a majority share of a rapidly\n\nappreciating  asset with  a  high potential  for future  profits.\n\nInstead,  Sullivan asserts, he was forced to sell the Patriots at\n\na depressed price to private buyers.\n\n          On May 16, 1991, Sullivan  sued the NFL claiming  that,\n\namong other  things, the NFL  had violated the  Sherman Antitrust\n\nAct, 15 U.S.C.    1-2, by preventing him from selling  49% of the\n\nPatriots to the public  in an equity offering.   Sullivan alleged\n\nthat, as a  result, he was forced  to sell the  entire team to  a\n\nprivate  buyer at a fire sale price  in order to pay off existing\n\ndebts.  Prior  to trial, the district  court dismissed Sullivan's\n\nclaim under    2 of the Sherman Act along  with various state law\n\nclaims.   After  a trial  on Sullivan's  claim under    1  of the\n\nSherman  Act, the  jury rendered  a verdict  for Sullivan  in the\n\namount of  $38 million,  which the  judge  later reduced  through\n\nremittitur  to $17 million.   Pursuant to  15 U.S.C.    15, which\n\nprovides for  treble damages for antitrust  violations, the court\n\n                               -5-\n\nentered a final judgment for Sullivan of $51 million.\n\n                               -6-\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\n\n          The  NFL  has  raised  a number  of  issues  on  appeal\n\nconcerning the application of   1 of the Sherman Act to the facts\n\nof this case, which, according to the NFL, entitle it to judgment\n\nas a matter  of law.  We address these issues first to see if the\n\npresent case should be dismissed, and we ultimately conclude that\n\nit should  not.  We next  address the NFL's  allegations of trial\n\nerror and we  find that several of them require  that we overturn\n\nthe verdict in this case and order a new trial.\n\n          The first  set of issues involves  the district court's\n\ndenial of the NFL's motions for judgment as a matter of law under\n\nFed. R.  Civ. P.  50.   We review the  court's decision  de novo,\n                                                                \n\nusing the same stringent decisional standards that controlled the\n\ndistrict court.

Under these standards,\n     \n\njudgment for the NFL can only be ordered if  the evidence, viewed\n\nin the light most  favorable to Sullivan, points so  strongly and\n\noverwhelmingly  in favor of the NFL, that a reasonable jury could\n\nnot have arrived at a verdict for Sullivan.  Gallagher,  962 F.2d\n                                                      \n\nat 124-25; Hendricks, 923 F.2d at 214.\n                    \n\n      III.  ISSUES ALLEGEDLY REQUIRING JUDGMENT FOR THE NFL\n\n                   A.  Lack of Antitrust Injury\n\n          To establish  an antitrust violation  under   1  of the\n\nSherman Act, Sullivan must prove that  the NFL's public ownership\n\npolicy is \"in  restraint of  trade.\"  Monahan's  Marine, Inc.  v.\n                                                             \n\n                               -7-\n\nBoston Whaler, Inc., 866  F.2d 525, 526  (1st Cir. 1989).   Under\n                   \n\nantitrust  law's  \"rule  of  reason,\"  the  NFL's  policy  is  in\n\nrestraint  of trade if the anticompetitive  effects of the policy\n\noutweigh the policy's legitimate business justifications.  Id. at\n                                                             \n\n526-27 (citing  Business Electronics Corp.  v.

Anticompetitive effects, more\n     \n\ncommonly referred to as  \"injury to competition\" or \"harm  to the\n\ncompetitive  process,\" are  usually  measured by  a reduction  in\n                                                                 \n\noutput  and  an  increase  in  prices  in  the  relevant  market.\n                                     \n\nNational Collegiate  Athletic Ass'n v.

Injury  to\n                         \n\ncompetition has also  been described more  generally in terms  of\n\ndecreased efficiency in the marketplace  which negatively impacts\n                    \n\nconsumers.   Town of Concord v.  Boston Edison Co.,  915 F.2d 17,\n                                                  \n\n21-22  (1st  Cir.  1990),  cert.  denied,  499  U.S.  931 (1991);\n                                        \n\nInterface Group, Inc. v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 816 F.2d 9, 10\n                                                 \n\n(1st Cir. 1987).   Thus, an action harms the  competitive process\n\n\"when it obstructs the achievement of competition's basic goals -\n\n- lower  prices, better  products, and more  efficient production\n\nmethods.\"  Town of Concord, 915 F.2d at 22.\n                          \n\n          The jury determined in this case, via a special verdict\n\nform,  that the relevant market is the \"nationwide market for the\n\n                               -8-\n\nsale and purchase of ownership interests in the National Football\n\nLeague member clubs, in general, and in the New England Patriots,\n\nin particular.\"   The jury went on to find  that the NFL's policy\n\nhad an \"actual harmful effect\" on competition in this market.\n\n          The  NFL  argues  on   appeal  that  Sullivan  has  not\n\nestablished the  existence of any injury to competition, and thus\n\nhas not established a  restraint of trade that can  be attributed\n\nto  the NFL's ownership policy.  The league's attack is two-fold,\n\nasserting (1)  that NFL clubs do not  compete with each other for\n\nthe sale of ownership interests in their teams so there exists no\n\ncompetition  to be injured in  the first place;  and (2) Sullivan\n\ndid not present sufficient evidence of injury to competition from\n\nwhich  a reasonable  jury could  conclude that  the  NFL's policy\n\nrestrains   trade.    Although   we  agree  with   the  NFL  that\n\nconceptualizing the  harm to competition  in this case  is rather\n\ndifficult, precedent and deference to the jury verdict ultimately\n\nrequire us to reject the NFL's challenge to the finding of injury\n\nto competition.\n\n          Critically, the  NFL does  not challenge on  appeal the\n                                        \n\njury's   initial  finding   of   the  relevant   market  and   no\n\ncorresponding challenge was raised  at trial.1  As a  result, the\n\n                    \n\n1   The  NFL  argues in  passing  that certain  expert  testimony\nrelated to the relevant  market issue was inherently unreasonable\nand thus could  not support the  jury's relevant market  finding.\nWe  do not  consider this  passing argument  to be  sufficient to\nraise the relevant market  issue on appeal as matters  averted to\nin  a  perfunctory  manner,   unaccompanied  by  some  effort  at\ndeveloped  argumentation, are  deemed waived  on appeal.   United\n                                                                 \nStates  v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d  456, 468 (1st  Cir. 1993).

Given the existence of a relevant market\n\nfor ownership interests in NFL teams, it is reasonable to presume\n\nthat  a  policy  restricting  the  buying  and  selling  of  such\n\nownership interests injures competition in that market.   The NFL\n\nnevertheless maintains that NFL teams do not compete against each\n\nother  for  the sale  of their  ownership  interests, even  if we\n\naccept that a market exists for such ownership interests.\n\n          1.

The question  of\n        \n\nwhether competition  exists between NFL  teams for sale  of their\n\nownership interests, such that the NFL's ownership policy injures\n\nthis  competition, is  ultimately a  question of  fact.   The NFL\n\nwould have us find, however, that,  as a matter of law, NFL teams\n\ndo not compete against each other for the sale of their ownership\n\ninterests.  We decline to make such a finding.\n\n          The NFL  relies on  a series  of cases  which allegedly\n\nstand for the \"well established\" rule that a professional  sports\n\nleague's  restrictions on who may  join the league  or acquire an\n\ninterest in a member club do not  give rise to a claim under  the\n\nantitrust laws.

To put it  another way, the  NFL's public ownership\n\npolicy allegedly does  not merely prevent the  replacement of one\n\nclub owner with another -- an action having little evident effect\n\non  competition --  it compromises  the entire  process by  which\n\ncompetition for club ownership occurs.2\n\n                    \n\n2   This same argument  distinguishes cases cited by  the NFL for\nthe  proposition that  a franchisor's  disapproval of  a proposed\nsale of  a franchise does not  give rise to  an antitrust injury.\nSee  Kestenbaum v.

As we  have  already  noted, NFL  member  clubs\n\ncompete in several ways off the field, which itself tends to show\n\nthat the teams pursue diverse interests and thus are not a single\n\nenterprise under   1.\n\n          Ultimately,  the NFL's Copperweld challenge is subsumed\n                                           \n\nunder the question of whether  or not the evidence can support  a\n\nfinding that NFL teams compete against each other for the sale of\n\ntheir  ownership interests.   Proof  of such  competition defeats\n\nboth  the  NFL's  challenge to  the  existence  of  an injury  to\n\ncompetition  and   the   NFL's  Copperweld   argument  as   well.\n                                          \n\nInsufficient proof  of such competition would  require a judgment\n\nin  favor of the NFL anyway, regardless of the implications under\n\nCopperweld.  As we  discuss below, the jury's finding  that there\n          \n\nexists  competition  between  teams  for the  sale  of  ownership\n\ninterests was based on sufficient evidence.\n\n          2.  Insufficient Evidence of Harm to Competition\n                                                          \n\n          The   NFL  contends  that   Sullivan  did  not  present\n\nsufficient evidence concerning: (1) the existence of  competition\n\n                               -15-\n\nbetween NFL clubs  for the sale of ownership  interests, or (2) a\n\ndecrease in output,  an increase in prices,  a detrimental effect\n\non  efficiency or other incidents  of harm to  competition in the\n\nrelevant market, from which a reasonable jury could conclude that\n\nthe NFL's policy injured competition.  Although we agree that the\n\nevidence  of all these factors  is rather thin,  we disagree that\n\nthe evidence  is too thin to support a jury verdict in Sullivan's\n\nfavor. \n\n          With   respect  to   evidence  of   the  existence   of\n\ncompetition  for   the  sale  of  ownership   interests,  one  of\n\nSullivan's experts, Professor Roger  Noll, testified that \"one of\n\nthe ways in which the NFL exercises monopoly power in the  market\n\nfor  the franchises and ownership  is by excluding certain people\n\nfrom owning  all or part --  any type part of  an NFL franchise.\"\n\nDr.  Noll explained that this \"enables a group of owners, in this\n\ncase, you only need eight owners,  to exclude from the League and\n\nfrom  competing with  them, people  who  might be  more effective\n\ncompetitors than they are.\"   The record also contains statements\n\nfrom several NFL owners which could reasonably be interpreted  as\n\nexpressions of concern about their  ability to compete with other\n\nteams  in the market for  investment capital in  general, and for\n\nthe  sale of  ownership interests  in particular.    For example,\n\nArthur  Rooney II of the  Pittsburgh Steelers stated  in a letter\n\nthat  he did not \"believe  that the individually  or family owned\n\nteams  will  be able  to compete  with the  consolidated groups.\"\n\nRalph  Wilson of the  Buffalo Bills stated  that big corporations\n\n                               -16-\n\nshould not own teams because it gives them an \"unfair competitive\n\nadvantage\" over other teams  since corporations will funnel money\n\ninto  the  team and  make it  \"more  competitive\" than  the other\n\nfranchises.   Former NFL Commissioner Pete  Rozelle admitted that\n\nsimilar sentiments had been expressed by NFL members.\n\n          Although   it   is  not   precisely   clear  that   the\n\n\"competition\"  about   which  Noll,   Rooney,  and  Wilson   were\n\ndiscussing  is  the same  competition at  issue  here --  that is\n\ncompetition for the sale  of ownership interests -- a  jury could\n\nreasonably interpret these statements as expressing a belief that\n\nthe competition  exists between teams  for the sale  of ownership\n\ninterests.    The statements  of the  two  NFL owners  imply that\n\ngreater access  to  capital  for all  teams  will  put  increased\n\npressure on some teams  to compete with others for  that capital,\n\nand  all   the  statements  reveal  that   the  ownership  rules,\n\nparticularly  the  rule against  public  ownership,  is the  main\n\nobstacle  preventing such  access.   The  fact that  ownership by\n\n\"consolidated  groups\"  is not  necessarily  the  same as  public\n\nownership  does  not  affect   the  conclusion  that  teams  face\n\ncompetitive   pressure  in  selling   their  ownership  interests\n\ngenerally to whoever  might buy them.  We also note that evidence\n\nof  actual, present competition is  not necessary as  long as the\n\nevidence shows that the potential for competition exists.  See L.\n                                                                 \n\nA.

The\n\nNFL points  out that other  NFL teams would not  compete with the\n\nPatriots for the sale of stock to their own fans.   This argument\n\nslightly  distorts Professor  Noll's testimony.   Professor  Noll\n\nstated that local  souvenir buyers  would be one  portion of  the\n\nmarket for Patriots stock.  Professor Noll also testified several\n\ntimes  that other investors would buy Patriots stock as well, for\n\ninvestment  purposes.  Noll's point was  that the souvenir buyers\n\nwould serve to bid up the price of the stock above what the price\n\nwould  normally be if  the Patriots were a  regular company.  His\n\ntestimony  did not  preclude  a finding  that  NFL teams  compete\n\nagainst  each  other  for  investment  capital via  the  sale  of\n\nownership interests.\n\n          The record  also  contains sufficient  evidence of  the\n\nnormal incidents of injury to competition from the NFL's policy -\n\n- reduced output, increased prices,  and reduced efficiency -- to\n\nsupport the  jury's verdict.   As  Dr. Noll  pointed  out in  his\n\ntestimony, the NFL's policy \"excludes individuals . . . who might\n\nwant to own a  share of stock  in a professional football  team.\"\n\nSeveral  NFL  officials  themselves  admitted   that  the  policy\n\nrestricts  the market  for  investment capital  among NFL  teams.\n\nThere  is thus  little dispute  that  the NFL's  ownership policy\n\n                               -18-\n\nreduces the available output of ownership interests.\n\n          The NFL is correct that, in one sense, the overall pool\n\nof potential output is fixed because there are  only 28 NFL teams\n\nand, although their  value may fluctuate,  the quantity of  their\n\nownership interests cannot.   However, the NFL's public ownership\n\npolicy completely  wipes out a certain type of ownership interest\n\n-- public  ownership of stock.  By restricting output in one form\n                                                                 \n\nof ownership, the NFL is thereby reducing the output of ownership\n\ninterests  overall.    In  other  words,  the  NFL  is  literally\n\nrestricting the output of a product -- a share in an NFL team.\n\n          There  was considerable testimony  concerning the price\n\neffects  of the NFL policy.  Both of Sullivan's experts testified\n\nthat the policy depressed the price of ownership interests in NFL\n\nteams because NFL franchises would normally command  a premium on\n\nthe  public market relative to their value in the private market,\n\nwhich is all that  the league currently permits.   Professor Noll\n\ntestified that fan loyalty  would push up the price  of ownership\n\ninterests  if  sales to  the public  were  allowed.   Even former\n\nCommissioner Pete Rozelle acknowledged  that \"it was pointed out,\n\nwith  justification,  it  has  been over  the  years,  that  [the\n\nownership policy] does restrict your market and, very likely, the\n\nprice you  could get for one  of our franchises if  you wanted to\n\nsell it, because  you are eliminating a very broad market . . . .\n\nAnd they have  said that there is a depression  on the price they\n\ncould get for their franchise.\"\n\n          The NFL  points  out that  the  alleged effect  of  its\n\n                               -19-\n\nownership  policy is  to  reduce  prices  of NFL  team  ownership\n                                \n\ninterests,  rather than  to raise  prices which  is normally  the\n\nmeasure of an injury to competition.  E.g.,  Town of Concord, 915\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 22.  We acknowledge that it is not  clear whether, absent\n\nsome sort of dumping or  predatory pricing, see, e.g.,  Monahan's\n                                                                 \n\nMarine, Inc. v. Boston Whaler, Inc., 866 F.2d 525,  527 (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1989), a decrease in prices can indicate injury to competition in\n\na  relevant market.   The Supreme Court  has emphasized, however,\n\nthat overall consumer preferences in setting output and prices is\n\nmore  important than higher prices  and lower output,  per se, in\n                                                             \n\ndetermining  whether there  has  been an  injury to  competition.\n\nNCAA, 468  U.S. at 107.   In this  case, regardless of  the exact\n    \n\nprice  effects of the NFL's policy, the overall market effects of\n\nthe  policy  are  plainly  unresponsive to  consumer  demand  for\n\nownership interests in NFL  teams.  Dr. Noll testified  that fans\n\nare interested in  buying shares in NFL teams and  that the NFL's\n\npolicy deprives  fans of  this product.   Moreover, evidence  was\n\npresented concerning  the public  offering of the  Boston Celtics\n\nprofessional  basketball  team which  demonstrated,  according to\n\nsome  of  the testimony,  fan  interest  in buying  ownership  of\n\nprofessional  sports teams.  Thus, a jury could conclude that the\n\nNFL's policy  injured competition  by making the  relevant market\n\n\"unresponsive to consumer preference.\"  Id.3\n                                          \n\n                    \n\n3   The  NFL maintains  that price  and output  are not  affected\nbecause its ownership policy  does not limit the number  of games\nor  teams, does  not raise ticket  prices or  the prices  of game\ntelecasts  and does not affect  the normal consumer  of the NFL's\nproduct in any  other way.   Such facts might  be relevant to  an\n\n                               -20-\n\n          As for overall efficiency of production in the relevant\n\nmarket,4  Sullivan's  experts  testified that  the  NFL's  policy\n\nhindered  efficiency  gains, and  that allowing  public ownership\n\nwould make for better football teams.  Professor Noll stated that\n\nthe NFL's public ownership policy prevented individuals who might\n\nbe \"more  efficient and  much better  at  running a  professional\n\nfootball  team\" from  owning teams.   Dr.  Noll also  stated that\n\npublicly owned  NFL teams  would be better  managed, and  produce\n\nhigher quality entertainment  for the fans.   Noll testified that\n\nthe  ownership  rule   excluded  certain   types  of   management\n\nstructures which  would likely be  more efficient in  running the\n\nteams,  resulting in  higher  franchise values.   One  NFL owner,\n\nLamar  Hunt, acknowledged  that increased  access to  capital can\n\nimprove  a  team's  operations  and performance.    A  memorandum\n\nprepared  by an NFL staff member stated that changes to the NFL's\n\n                    \n\ninquiry of whether the NFL's policy harms overall efficiency, see\n                                                                 \ninfra note  [4], but  it is not  relevant to  whether the  policy\n     \naffects output  and prices in  the relevant market  for ownership\n                                                  \ninterests.   Just  because consumers  of \"NFL  football\" are  not\naffected  by output  controls and price  increases does  not mean\nthat  consumers of a  product in the  relevant market  are not so\naffected.   In  this  case, two  types  of consumers  are  denied\nproducts  by the NFL policy:  consumers who want  to buy stock of\nthe Patriots or other teams, and consumers like Sullivan who want\nto  \"purchase\"  investment  capital  in  the  market  for  public\nfinancing.\n\n4   Although  the product  at  issue in  the  relevant market  is\n\"ownership interests,\" efficiency  in production of  that product\ncan be measured by the value of the ownership interest.  That is,\nan improved  product produced more efficiently  will be reflected\nin the value of the output in question (regardless of the price).\nIn this case, the value of  the product depends on the success of\nthe  Patriots'  football  team,  the overall  efficiency  of  its\noperations, and the success of the NFL in general. \n\n                               -21-\n\npublic ownership  policy could contribute to each  NFL team's own\n\nfinancial strength and viability, which in turn would benefit the\n\nentire NFL because  the league  has a strong  interest in  having\n\nstrong, viable teams.\n\n          The  NFL presented a  large amount  of evidence  to the\n\ncontrary and  now claims on  appeal that Sullivan's  position was\n\nbased on nothing more  than sheer speculation.  We  have reviewed\n\nthe record, however,  and we cannot say that the  evidence was so\n\noverwhelming that no  reasonable jury could find  against the NFL\n\nand in favor  of Sullivan.  We therefore refuse to enter judgment\n\nin favor of the NFL as a matter of law.\n\n                      B.  Ancillary Benefits\n\n          The  NFL next argues that  even if its public ownership\n\npolicy  injures competition in  a relevant  market, it  should be\n\nupheld as ancillary to the legitimate joint activity that is \"NFL\n                   \n\nfootball\" and thus not violative of the Sherman Act.   We take no\n\nissue  with the  proposition that  certain joint  ventures enable\n\nseparate business entities to  combine their skills and resources\n\nin pursuit of a common goal that cannot be effectively pursued by\n\nthe  venturers acting alone.  See, e.g., Broadcast Music, Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nColumbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,  441 U.S. 1 (1979).   We also\n                                  \n\ndo  not dispute  that  a \"restraint\"  that  is ancillary  to  the\n\nfunctioning of such a joint activity -- i.e. one that is required\n\nto make the joint activity more efficient -- does not necessarily\n\nviolate  the antitrust laws.

Pacific\n                                                                 \n\nStationery  &amp;  Printing Co.,  472 U.S.  284,  295-96 (1985).   We\n                           \n\nfurther  accept,   for  purposes  of  this   appeal,  that  rules\n\ncontrolling who  may join a joint  venture can be ancillary  to a\n\nlegitimate joint activity and  that the NFL's own policy  against\n\npublic  ownership constitutes  one example  of such  an ancillary\n      \n\nrule.    Finally,  we accept  the  NFL's  claim  that its  public\n\nownership  policy  contributes  to  the ability  of  the  NFL  to\n\nfunction  as an  effective  sports  league,  and that  the  NFL's\n\nfunctioning  would  be  impaired  if publicly  owned  teams  were\n\npermitted, because the short-term  dividend interests of a club's\n\nshareholder would often conflict  with the long-term interests of\n\nthe league  as a whole.  That is, the policy avoids a detrimental\n\nconflict of interests between team shareholders and the league.\n\n          We disagree, however, that these factors are sufficient\n\nto  establish as a matter of  law that the NFL's ownership policy\n\ndoes not unreasonably restrain trade  in violation of   1  of the\n\nSherman Act.

The record contains  evidence of a  clearly less\n\nrestrictive alternative to the  NFL's ownership policy that would\n\nyield the same benefits  as the current policy.   Sullivan points\n\nto one proposal to amend the current ownership policy by allowing\n\nfor the sale  of minority, nonvoting shares of team  stock to the\n\npublic  with restrictions on the size  of the holdings by any one\n\nindividual.   Dividend payments, if any, would be within the firm\n\ncontrol of the NFL majority owner.  Under such a policy, it would\n\nbe  reasonable for  a jury  to conclude  that private  control of\n\nmember clubs  is maintained,  conflicts of interest  are avoided,\n\nand  all  the   other  \"benefits\"  of  the  NFL's  joint  venture\n\narrangement are preserved while at the same time teams would have\n\naccess to  the market for  public investment capital  through the\n\nsale of ownership interests.\n\n                 C.

Although  the evidence  of\n\ncausation is  not overwhelming, it is  nevertheless sufficient to\n\nsupport the verdict.\n\n          Regarding  the NFL's  first  claim that  Sullivan never\n\ncalled for  a  vote  from  the  owners to  change  or  waive  the\n\nownership policy,  Sullivan presented sufficient evidence to show\n\nthat the NFL essentially rejected Sullivan's request, even though\n\nno  official  vote was  taken.

Certainly, if  Sullivan can\n\nprove  futility independent of any official  request, he need not\n\nshow that he  actually called for  a vote  and received a  denial\n\nfrom the other NFL owners.\n\n          The jury in this  case heard evidence that would  allow\n\nit to conclude that the NFL effectively denied Sullivan's request\n\nfor a waiver  or amendment  of the public  ownership policy,  and\n\n                               -27-\n\nthat an official  vote would indeed have been  futile.  The NFL's\n\npolicy against public ownership was long-standing, and the policy\n\nwithstood  several  efforts  to  change  it  over  the  years  as\n\nproffered  amendment  proposals were  never  brought  to a  vote.\n\nSullivan requested a wavier of, or  amendment to, the policy at a\n\nmeeting  of the  owners  on October  27, 1987.   His  request was\n\ntabled.     After  further  discussions,  then-Commissioner  Pete\n\nRozelle  said that he opposed  the proposal and  that the chances\n\nfor league approval  were \"very dubious.\"   Although Sullivan was\n\nonly four  votes shy  of winning a  vote, with seven  votes still\n\nundecided, the jury  could reasonably conclude that,  in light of\n\nthe  Commissioner's  statement,  Sullivan  tried  but  failed  to\n\nconvince those undecided owners  to vote in his favor and that an\n\nactual  vote  would  have been  futile.    The  evidence is  thus\n\nsufficient  to support  a  finding  that  the  NFL's  policy  was\n\neffectively enforced against Sullivan and that  the policy did in\n\nfact, when considered with  the evidence discussed below, prevent\n\nSullivan from making his public offering of 49% of the Patriots.\n\n          Sullivan  also presented sufficient evidence to support\n\na  finding that  the Patriots  stock sale  was both  feasible and\n\npotentially  successful.   Sullivan met  with Stephens,  Inc., an\n\ninvestment banking firm, to discuss a deal whereby Stephens would\n\narrange for a loan of  $80 million to Sullivan and his  son, half\n\nof which would  be paid back out of the  proceeds of the Patriots\n\nstock  offering,  which  Stephens  would  also  arrange.    In  a\n\nsubsequent letter, Stephens  stated that it had been  retained to\n\n                               -28-\n\nassist in the \"private placement of $80 million of debt\" and  set\n\nout some preliminary terms and conditions.  Although specifics of\n\nthe  public offering  were  not discussed,  and Stephens  did not\n\ndetermine whether  the  stock offering  was ultimately  feasible,\n\nStephens repeatedly made it clear  to Sullivan that NFL  approval\n\nwas  required --  indeed  Stephens specifically  singled out  NFL\n\napproval as the prerequisite -- before Stephens could proceed any\n               \n\nfurther with  efforts to  prepare for the  placement of  Patriots\n\nstock.\n\n          As discussed above,  NFL approval  was never  obtained.\n\nTherefore,  the jury could conclude that lack of approval was the\n\nreason  Stephens was  unwilling  to proceed  with the  deal, even\n\nthough  Stephens  also expressed  some  concern about  Sullivan's\n\nfinancial and legal troubles.  The jury also heard testimony that\n\nCharles Allen, a prominent investment banker in New York, thought\n\nthe  Patriots  public  offering  was  feasible and  that  he  was\n\npotentially interested  in arranging the deal.   Sullivan himself\n\ntestified  that  the  stock  sale   was  feasible  based  on  his\n\nexperience with the previous public offering of Patriots stock in\n\n1960, and based  on the  public offering of  the Boston  Celtics.\n\nFinally, one of Sullivan's experts, Patrick Brake, testified that\n\nthe  public offering  would have  been feasible  had the  NFL not\n\nblocked it.\n\n          In  addition, despite  significant financial  and legal\n\nproblems with the Patriots, the evidence is sufficient to support\n\na finding that Sullivan  could have solved these problems  in the\n\n                               -29-\n\ncourse  of the public offering  and, further, that  he could have\n\nbrought off a  successful stock  sale that would  have raised  at\n\nleast $70 million.\n\n          The NFL focusses its challenge to the potential success\n\nof  Sullivan's offering on  the testimony  of Patrick  Brake, who\n\nprovided the $70 million figure as the value for  the stock sale.\n\nAccording to the  NFL, Brake's  testimony could  not support  the\n\njury's finding on causation  because it was not supported  by any\n\nfacts,  it was not grounded  in any rational  methodology, and it\n\nignored important factors  indicating that the Patriots  offering\n\nwould  not  be  a  success.    The NFL  does  not  challenge  the\n\nadmissibility of  Brake's opinion  but, instead, claims  that his\n\nopinion cannot support the jury's finding that the Patriots stock\n\nsale  would have  been a  success if  the NFL  had allowed  it to\n\nhappen.\n\n          \"When an expert opinion  is not supported by sufficient\n\nfacts to validate it in the eyes of the law, or when indisputable\n\nrecord   facts  contradict  or   otherwise  render   the  opinion\n\nunreasonable, it cannot support a jury's verdict.\"  Brooke Group,\n                                                                 \n\nLtd. v.

Exchange National  Bank, 877  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1333, 1339 (7th Cir. 1989). \n\n          We  agree  that  the  facts  and  reasoning  underlying\n\nBrake's  opinions and testimony leave much to be desired from the\n\nstandpoint of  a factfinder  charged with determining  the facts.\n\nAs a matter of law, however, Brake provided enough of a basis for\n\nhis opinions and had sufficient facts to back his opinions up, to\n\nsupport, in combination  with the evidence from other  sources, a\n\njury  finding of  potential success  of the  Patriots stock  sale\n\nventure.  To begin with, Brake  stated in his testimony that  his\n\nopinion was based on a review of documents and depositions in the\n\ncase,  a review of the  prospectus for the  Boston Celtics public\n\noffering,  the  fact  that  future television  revenues  for  the\n\nPatriots were likely to increase due to  the Patriots' appearance\n\nin the  Super Bowl, and  the fact that  the public stock  for NFL\n\nteams, like the  Patriots, would  trade at a  premium value  over\n\nwhat  the club would otherwise be  worth.  Brake also stated that\n\nhe  looked at  a  financial statement  of  the Patriots  and  was\n\napprised of some of the debt and loss history of the club.  Other\n\ntestimony and evidence at trial supported the claim that stock of\n\nNFL teams would  sell for a premium above the club's private sale\n\nvalue  and  the claim  that TV  revenues to  the NFL  teams would\n\nincrease.   Sullivan  himself  testified that  a public  offering\n\nwould  be successful  based  upon  the  success  of  his  earlier\n\noffering  of Patriots  stock and  on the  results of  the Celtics\n\npublic  offering.  There  was also testimony  -- highly disputed,\n\n                               -31-\n\nbut potentially  credible testimony nonetheless --  to the effect\n\nthat  the  Celtics' stock  offering was  a  success and  that the\n\nPatriots  stock offering  could  be patterned  after the  Celtics\n\noffering.\n\n          As  for  the source  of  Brake's  specific $70  million\n\nfigure for  the  likely  proceeds  from a  sale  of  49%  of  the\n\nPatriots,  Brake  explained  a two-step  public  offering process\n\nwhich,  after  subtracting  underwriting fees,  would  yield  the\n\nSullivan's  $70 million.    Brake arrived  at  this figure  after\n\nstarting  with a  base value  of $150  million for  the Patriots.\n\nGiven the $80 million private sale price of the Patriots obtained\n\nby  Sullivan  when  he actually  sold  the  team,  and given  the\n\ntestimony  by Brake  and others  that public  stock of  NFL teams\n\nwould sell at a premium, we cannot say that the opinion by Brake,\n\nan investment banking expert,  was unreasonable or \"not supported\n\nby  sufficient facts  to validate  it in  the eyes  of the  law.\"\n\nBrooke Group, 113 S. Ct. at 2589.\n            \n\n          Brake's  testimony was not  merely conclusory.  Rather,\n\nit was  embellished by various  explanations and  justifications.\n\nHis  testimony was  also not  overwhelmingly contradicted  by the\n\nweight of  the evidence or inherently contradictory, unreasonable\n\nor irrational.   Brake did overlook  some important factors  that\n\ncontradicted  his  opinion, but  he  was  questioned about  these\n\nfactors on cross-examination and  the NFL argued them before  the\n\njury.  The factors do not invalidate Brake's  opinion as a matter\n\nof law; rather, they  merely go to the weight  and credibility of\n\n                               -32-\n\nhis  opinions which are  matters for the  jury to consider.   The\n\nbasis of the opinion regarding the success of the Patriots public\n\noffering may be flimsy,  but it is not nonexistent  or irrational\n\nas a matter of law.\n\n          Although we  share the NFL's  skepticism that  Sullivan\n\nwould  have succeeded  in  his public  offering  if the  NFL  had\n\nallowed him to  try it, we cannot say  that, as a matter  of law,\n\nthe  evidence was so  overwhelming that no  reasonable jury could\n\nfind that the NFL's policy harmed Sullivan by preventing him from\n\ndoing  something he  would otherwise  have been  able to do.   We\n\ntherefore  reject  the  NFL's claim  that  it  is  entitled to  a\n\njudgment in its favor on the basis that Sullivan failed to  prove\n\nhis injury was caused by the alleged antitrust violation.\n\n                D.  Assignment of Antitrust Claim\n\n          The NFL argues that  Sullivan cannot bring this lawsuit\n\nbecause  he sold his antitrust  claim when he  sold the Patriots.\n\nThe  sale  contract  between  Sullivan and  KMS  Patriots,  L.P.,\n\nprovided  that  Sullivan transferred  to  the  buyers \"all  other\n\nassets\" of the Patriots' and its holding company,5 besides  those\n\nspecifically listed and those specifically excluded.  None of the\n\nlisted or excluded assets include an antitrust claim.   According\n\nto the NFL,  the term  \"all other assets\"  should be  interpreted\n\n                    \n\n5  The language of the contract actually states \"all other assets\nof  Selling Group,\"  which includes  Sullivan himself.   However,\nneither party asserts that Sullivan  intended to transfer all his\npersonal  assets  with this  clause and,  anyway, the  \"all other\nassets\" clause is number seventeen on a list of items referred to\nby the contract as  \"the following assets of the  Club and Holdco\n[the Patriots' holding company].\" \n\n                               -33-\n\nbroadly to include  the present  antitrust cause of  action.   We\n\ndisagree.    Absent some  express  language  to the  effect  that\n\nSullivan was selling his  football related \"antitrust claims\" or,\n\nat  the very  least,  \"causes of  action,\"  we cannot  find  that\n\nSullivan  assigned the present  antitrust claim to  the buyers of\n\nthe  Patriots.

As no such express language  appears in\n\nthe  contract  for the  sale of  the  Patriots, Sullivan  did not\n\ntransfer his interest in the present lawsuit to KMS Patriots when\n\nhe sold the team.\n\n          The NFL's  arguments concerning the application  of   1\n\nof the  Sherman Act to the facts of this case raise a substantial\n\nchallenge to the jury verdict and are certainly weighty enough to\n\ngive  us  pause.    Upon  careful  consideration  of  the issues,\n\nhowever, we find Sullivan's theory of the case to be  a plausible\n\none and  ultimately find the  evidence sufficient to  support it.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, therefore, we see no justification, as\n\na matter of law, for ringing the death knell on this litigation.\n\n                        IV.  TRIAL ERRORS\n\n          Having reviewed those issues which would have warranted\n\na  judgment in  favor of  the NFL,  had we  decided any  of those\n\n                               -34-\n\nissues in the NFL's favor, we now turn to the NFL's claim that it\n\nis  entitled to a new  trial because of  allegedly erroneous jury\n\ninstructions  and other  trial  errors.   In particular,  the NFL\n\nasserts that the district  court failed to provide the  jury with\n\nseveral crucial jury instructions that were required  in order to\n\npresent to  the jury certain legal theories that were potentially\n\ndispositive  of the  verdict.   The NFL  argues that  the court's\n\nfailure to give the  instructions was prejudicial error requiring\n\na new trial.\n\n          Determining whether the failure to  give proffered jury\n\ninstructions  is  error  depends  on  whether   the  instructions\n\nactually  given  to  the  jury,  taken  as  a  whole,  adequately\n\nexplained  the law or whether  they tended to  confuse or mislead\n\nthe jury  on  the controlling  issues  of  the case.

Equal Involvement Defense\n\n          The NFL argued before  the district court that Sullivan\n\nwas a complete and  substantially equal participant in  the NFL's\n\nownership  policy which he now challenges in the present lawsuit.\n\nAs a result of Sullivan's  involvement, the NFL claimed, Sullivan\n\nwas  barred from  bringing a damages  action under  the antitrust\n\nlaws pursuant to  the \"equal involvement defense\"  doctrine.  The\n\ndistrict court denied motions for summary judgment and a directed\n\nverdict  on this issue and, further, refused to instruct the jury\n\non  the availability  of the  defense because  it found  that the\n\n                    \n\n6   The court's failure  to instruct on  the complete involvement\ndefense was prejudicial error  and, by itself, sufficient grounds\nfor reversal  and a new trial.   We do not decide  whether any of\nthe other errors, standing  alone, are prejudicial.  We  do hold,\nhowever, that all the errors taken together are prejudicial.\n\n                               -36-\n\nevidence  showed   that  Sullivan  \"had  very   little,  if  any,\n\ninvolvement in  the formulation of [the  public ownership] rule,\"\n\nand  because the rule \"was imposed on [Sullivan] by a preexisting\n\nNational   Football  League  rule.\"     This  ruling  constituted\n\nprejudicial error  because the \"equal involvement  defense\" is an\n\nabsolute defense to an  antitrust claim and because the  evidence\n\nwarranted sending the issue to the jury.\n\n          A plaintiff's \"complete,  voluntary, and  substantially\n\nequal participation\"  in an illegal practice  under the antitrust\n\nlaws precludes recovery for that antitrust violation.

We do not see\n                                \na  preclusion  of Sullivan's  damages  action  as presenting  any\n\n                               -37-\n\nLeaseways,  830 F.2d at 720-26; CVD, 769  F.2d at 856.  It is not\n                                   \n\nessential  to  the defense  that  the  plaintiff actually  helped\n\nauthor  or create the policy, although such facts would be highly\n\nprobative, as long as the plaintiff was substantially responsible\n\nfor  maintaining and  otherwise  effectuating the  policy.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  General  Leaseways,  830   F.2d  at  723  (applying  equal\n                         \n\ninvolvement defense  in case where plaintiff  did not participate\n\nin the  actual  adoption of  the  policy although  plaintiff  was\n\nsubstantially involved  in supporting, enforcing  and maintaining\n\nthe  policy).8   On  the other  hand,  proof that  the  plaintiff\n\nbenefitted  from the challenged policy or failed to object to the\n\npolicy, without  more, is  not sufficient to  show \"substantially\n\nequal  participation.\"   See id.,  830 F.2d  at 725  (noting that\n                               \n\n\"mere  participation\" in  the challenged  policy is  not enough).\n\nMoreover, proof that the plaintiff was coerced (\"economically\" or\n\n                    \n\nsignificant  interference  with antitrust  law enforcement.   The\nNFL's policy is  still subject to  challenge under the  antitrust\nlaws.   Because the  equal involvement  defense only  precludes a\ndamages action,  Sullivan could have requested  injunctive relief\nwhen  the public  ownership policy  was allegedly  preventing him\nfrom selling 49% of his team.  In addition, other owners who were\nnot involved  in the adoption or support  of the policy may still\nbring  suit  should they  desire to  sell ownership  interests in\ntheir team to the public.\n\n8    To the  extent this  conflicts with  the \"but  for\" standard\napplied  in  THI-Hawaii,  627  F.2d   at  995  (finding  that  \"a\n                       \nplaintiff's recovery is not  barred unless the illegal conspiracy\nwould  not have  been  formed  but  for its  participation\"),  we\n                                       \ndecline to follow that portion of the case.  There is no evidence\nof  such a  rigid \"but  for\" requirement  in the  Supreme Court's\nformulation of the equal involvement defense in Bateman, 472 U.S.\n                                                       \nat  310-11 (finding the defense applies where \"as a direct result\nof  his own actions,  the plaintiff bears  at least substantially\nequal responsibility for the violations he seeks to redress\").\n\n                               -38-\n\notherwise)  into  supporting  the   policy,  that  the  plaintiff\n\nattempted to oppose the illegal  conduct, or that the plaintiff's\n\nparticipation was otherwise not voluntary, is highly probative of\n\nthe absence of complete and equal involvement by the plaintiff in\n\nan antitrust violation.  E.g., CVD, 769 F.2d at 856.\n                                  \n\n          In this case, the evidence in the record was sufficient\n\nto support a jury  instruction on the equal  involvement defense.\n\nSullivan was one of the three  AFL members on the Joint Committee\n\nthat established the policies,  including the ownership policies,\n\nthat were to govern the new expanded NFL.  That Committee agreed,\n\nin  a merger  agreement signed  by Sullivan,  to adopt  the NFL's\n\npolicy against public ownership for the new NFL.  Sullivan's son,\n\nChuck,  stated that Sullivan was the central figure in the merger\n\nnegotiations.   Sullivan subsequently relied on  the NFL's public\n\nownership policy to justify  his purchase, through the merger  of\n\nhis team into a wholly owned company, of the outstanding stock of\n\nthe   Patriots  in  1976.    In  the  proxy  statement  for  that\n\ntransaction, Sullivan  listed  the NFL's  policy  against  public\n\nownership as one of the \"Reasons for the Merger\", and he attached\n\na  letter from the NFL justifying the public ownership policy and\n\nexplaining  that the  continued presence  of  public stockholders\n\nconflicted  with  the interests  of  the league.    Sullivan also\n\naffirmatively supported the policy  in sworn testimony during the\n\nlitigation with his  former shareholders  following the  Patriots\n\nmerger.  Sullivan stated that the  NFL's public ownership policy,\n\nand the  justifications underlying  the policy, were  the reasons\n\n                               -39-\n\nfor  his desire to purchase  all outstanding shares  of the team.\n\nThere  is no evidence that  Sullivan ever opposed  or objected to\n\ntheownership policypriorto thecircumstances surroundingthis case.\n\n          Taken  together,  this  evidence  is  sufficient for  a\n\nreasonable  jury to  conclude  that Sullivan  bears substantially\n\nequal  responsibility  for  the  NFL's  public  ownership  policy\n\nbecause  Sullivan helped adopt the policy, he relied upon it, and\n\nhe actively supported it.  The  jury, however, was never given an\n\nopportunity  to consider  this  evidence in  light  of the  equal\n\ninvolvement defense.\n\n          Sullivan  claims that  he was  not at  the meetings  in\n\nwhich  Lamar Hunt, the chairman  of the AFL  committee, agreed to\n\nthe NFL's public ownership  policy, and that he  did not know  in\n\nadvance that the old NFL's public ownership rule would be adopted\n\nby the  new NFL.   Mr. Hunt himself  testified, however, that  he\n\nalways spoke for the entire AFL committee at his various meetings\n\nwith NFL owners, and that he discussed various negotiating points\n\nwith  the  other  AFL  owners,  including  Sullivan,  before  any\n\ndecisions were made.   Moreover, Sullivan's  own team obtained  a\n\nspecific waiver  from the  ownership policy, which,  a reasonably\n\njury could  infer, indicates that  Sullivan was  involved in  the\n\ndecision to adopt  the policy.   In any event,  it is the  jury's\n\nresponsibility  to  weigh  the  evidence  and  make a  choice  in\n\ncircumstances  like this  where  the same  evidence supports  two\n\ndifferent yet reasonable conclusions.\n\n          The  district court erred  by failing to  give the jury\n\n                               -40-\n\nthe opportunity to  choose between these  versions of the  facts.\n\nThe court's  \"finding\" that Sullivan's involvement  in the public\n\nownership policy was minimal ignores evidence in the record.  The\n\ncourt's view that the NFL imposed the ownership policy on the AFL\n\nowners, rendering  their  participation involuntary,  is  largely\n\nunsupported  by  the  record.   Ultimately,  however,  these  are\n\nfactual  questions  for the  jury  and none  of  the instructions\n\nprovided  by the district court served to adequately instruct the\n\njury on this issue or send the issue to the jury.  Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court  erred in  refusing  to give  the NFL's  proffered\n\ninstruction on the \"equal involvement\" defense.\n\n          The error was prejudicial.  By refusing to instruct the\n\njury  on  the  equal  involvement  defense,  the  district  court\n\ndeprived the NFL of a  complete defense from Sullivan's  lawsuit.\n\nThe NFL presented facts that could have led to a dismissal of the\n\ncase if they were believed by  a properly instructed jury.  While\n\nthe NFL could have  highlighted, and in fact did  highlight, some\n\nof the facts concerning Sullivan's support of, and reliance upon,\n\nthe  ownership policy  in its closing  argument before  the jury,\n\nthis effort was limited to the argument that the NFL's policy was\n\n\"reasonable\"  for purposes of the  rule of reason  analysis.  The\n\nNFL did not, and could not, argue to the jury that it should rule\n\nin favor  of  the NFL  because  Sullivan's participation  in  the\n\nadoption  and  maintenance of  the  public  ownership policy  was\n\ncomplete,  voluntary  and  substantially  equal.     Without  the\n\nproffered  instruction,  the jury  had  no  occasion to  consider\n\n                               -41-\n\nwhether Sullivan  should be deprived of a  damages remedy because\n\nof his involvement in the policy he now challenges.  As a result,\n\nthe  district  court's  refusal  to send  the  equal  involvement\n\ndefense to the jury was prejudicial error requiring a new trial.\n\n      B.  Failure to Request an Official Vote of the Owners\n\n          As  discussed  in  Section  II.C. above,  in  order  to\n\nestablish  that the  policy  actually caused  injury to  himself,\n\nSullivan must prove  that the NFL effectively denied  his request\n\nto waive or  amend its  policy against public  ownership.   While\n\nthere is evidence that  supports a finding that the  NFL's policy\n\neffectively  blocked Sullivan from  pursuing his public offering,\n\nthere is also sufficient evidence to support a  contrary finding.\n\nSullivan's failure to  request a  vote from the  owners after  he\n\ndiscovered that he was four votes shy of  obtaining a waiver with\n\nseven owners  still undecided, combined with  former Commissioner\n\nRozelle's testimony that he told Sullivan  that Rozelle would put\n\nto  the owners  any plan  that Sullivan  wished, could  support a\n\nfinding  that Sullivan  was  a \"dormant  plaintiff\"  who did  not\n\n\"spring  into action\"  until it  was \"time  to file  suit.\"   Out\n                                                                 \n\nFront, 748 F.2d at 170.  As such, a jury could conclude  that the\n     \n\nNFL  did not prevent Sullivan  from pursuing his  stock sale, but\n\ninstead, Sullivan  simply dropped the idea  for reasons unrelated\n\nto the  NFL's policy.  If the jury had reached such a conclusion,\n\nSullivan would have failed to prove that his injury was caused by\n\nthe antitrust policy, and judgment for the NFL would be required.\n\n          The  NFL  proposed  instructions concerning  Sullivan's\n\n                               -42-\n\nfailure to ask for a vote essentially stating that such a failure\n\nwould result  in judgment  for the  NFL if  it was reasonable  to\n\nrequire  Sullivan to make  such a request.   The court refused to\n\ngive the  instruction because it felt  that to do so  would be to\n\ncomment on the evidence, and the court did not want to comment on\n\nany  of the  evidence  presented at  trial.   We  understand  the\n\ncourt's concern but believe  that, under the facts of  this case,\n\nthere   is  a  crucial  point  of  law  contained  in  the  NFL's\n\ninstruction that was not otherwise provided to the jury.\n\n          The  jury  was instructed  generally  on  the issue  of\n\ncausation, but it was  not told that it had to  determine whether\n\nthe NFL's  policy against public ownership  was actually enforced\n\nagainst  Sullivan;  that  is,  whether the  policy,  the  alleged\n\nantitrust restraint, actually restrained Sullivan in any way from\n\nmaking a  49% public  offering of  his  team.   Although the  NFL\n\ncould, and did,  argue that Sullivan's failure to ask  for a vote\n\nwas  evidence that the policy  did not cause  injury to Sullivan,\n\nthere was no legal hook upon  which the jury could hang the NFL's\n\nargument.   The  failure  of  Sullivan to  request  a  vote is  a\n\ncritical  and potentially dispositive issue in this case.  If the\n\nalleged restraint of trade  does not even exist in  practice, the\n\nwhole case  essentially disappears.   Therefore, the  jury should\n\nhave been directed  to make a specific finding  as to whether the\n\npublic ownership policy was enforced against Sullivan.\n\n          If the jury is instructed that Sullivan must prove that\n\nthe NFL's policy  was enforced  against him, the  jury will  have\n\n                               -43-\n\ncause  to consider the crucial matter of whether the NFL actually\n\nenforced its policy  against Sullivan or rather,  whether the NFL\n\nnever had the chance  to enforce its policy because  Sullivan was\n\nnever  prepared to pursue his  public offering.  The instructions\n\nas  proffered  by the  NFL  may  need  to  be tailored  to  avoid\n\ncommenting on  the evidence surrounding the \"missing\" vote by the\n\nNFL  owners, but  that does not  excuse the court  from giving no\n\ninstruction  at all  on  the issue.   The  failure  to give  some\n\ninstruction concerning the failure of  Sullivan to request a vote\n\nwas error.        \n\n                      C.  The Murray Option\n\n          In 1986, prior to Sullivan's decision to  sell Patriots\n\nstock  to the public, Sullivan sold Fran  Murray an option to buy\n\nthe entire  club.   The  NFL took  the position  that the  Murray\n\noption  would have  been an  absolute bar to  any public  sale of\n\nPatriots  stock  and  that  Sullivan therefore  could  not  prove\n\ncausation.    The  NFL's   position  was  supported  by  evidence\n\nintroduced at trial.  Sullivan proffered evidence that the option\n\nwas not  a bar to sale because the option could be bought out and\n\nbecause it  could not be legally enforced.   The issue of whether\n\nMurray  could have, or would  have, blocked a  public offering by\n\nthe Patriots was ultimately disputed.\n\n          The option agreement and Murray's  deposition testimony\n\nwere  received  into  evidence.   The  district  court,  however,\n\nrefused to admit  Murray's statement  that he  would indeed  have\n\nstopped  any public stock sale of the Patriots from going forward\n\n                               -44-\n\nif  he had been told about it.   The court found the testimony to\n\nbe  too speculative to be admissible.  While the court's decision\n\nto exclude  Murray's \"speculative\"  testimony is well  within the\n\ncourt's wide  latitude of  discretion in making  such evidentiary\n\nrulings, United States  v. Abel, 469 U.S. 45, 54  (1984); Doty v.\n                                                              \n\nSewall,  908  F.2d  1053, 1058  (1st  Cir.  1990),  we note  that\n      \n\nSullivan's  entire case as to the causation of injury was equally\n\nspeculative.   Whether Sullivan's proposed stock  sale could have\n\nproceeded  and would have been  successful in the  absence of the\n\nNFL's  public  ownership  policy  was a  matter  of  considerable\n\nconjecture.  Fairness would seem to militate towards allowing the\n\nNFL to present  its own version of the  probable course of future\n\nevents to counter Sullivans' theorizing.\n\n          In any  event, the  court's subsequent refusal  to give\n\nthe  NFL's proffered  jury  instruction on  the  law of  options,\n\nspecifically    the   legal   consequences   of   options   under\n\nMassachusetts law, erroneously removed another crucial issue from\n\nthe jury's purview.  The Murray  option was a key defense for the\n\nNFL,  because if  Sullivan did  not have  a legal  right to  sell\n\nPatriots stock to the public, he did not suffer any harm from the\n\nNFL's  ownership policy and the  NFL would have  been entitled to\n\njudgment in its favor.   Again, the NFL could make  this argument\n\nto  the jury, but the  jury would still  lack crucial information\n\nconcerning the legal underpinnings  of a crucial defense for  the\n\nNFL.\n\n          Sullivan argues  that  the NFL's  proposed  instruction\n\n                               -45-\n\nwould have singled out one factual issue related to causation for\n\nthe jury's special attention,  something that would have unfairly\n\nprejudiced Sullivan.  Sullivan adds that allowing the instruction\n\nwould  have  generated  countering  instructions  on other  legal\n\nfacets of option law that were relevant to Sullivan's position on\n\nthe  option issue  and ultimately  would have confused  the jury.\n\nThese  arguments  notwithstanding,  we  feel  that,  as  long  as\n\nsuitable  instructions  are  provided covering  the  basic  legal\n\npoints  relevant to each party's arguments, the jury would not be\n\nunduly  confused.   Furthermore, the risk  of prejudice  from the\n\ninstruction -- due  to the  added attention afforded  one of  the\n\nNFL's  defenses  --  is  not sufficient  to  justify  effectively\n\ndepriving  the NFL of a crucial defense.   Ultimately, it was for\n\nthe jury  to  decide whether  the  Murray option  constituted  an\n\ninsurmountable obstacle to Sullivan's  case on causation, and the\n\ndistrict  court's  refusal  to instruct  on  the  law of  options\n\nvirtually removed this issue from consideration by the jury.\n\n     D.  Balancing Procompetitive and Anticompetitive Effects\n                      in the Relevant Market\n\n          As we noted above, the rule of reason analysis requires\n\na  weighing  of  the  injury  and  the  benefits  to  competition\n\nattributable to a practice  that allegedly violates the antitrust\n\nlaws.   Monahan's Marine, 866  F.2d at 526.   The  district court\n                        \n\ninstructed the  jury on its verdict form to balance the injury to\n\ncompetition  in   the  relevant  market  with   the  benefits  to\n\ncompetition in  that same relevant  market.   The NFL  protested,\n\nclaiming  that all  procompetitive  effects of  its policy,  even\n\n                               -46-\n\nthose  in a  market  different from  that  in which  the  alleged\n\nrestraint operated,  should be  considered.   The NFL's  case was\n\npremised on  the claim that  its policy against  public ownership\n\nwas  an important part of the effective functioning of the league\n\nas a  joint venture.  Although  it was not readily  apparent that\n\nthis  beneficial  effect  applied  to the  market  for  ownership\n\ninterests  in NFL teams, the  relevant market found  by the jury,\n\nthe  NFL  argued that  its  justification  should necessarily  be\n\nweighed by the jury under the rule of reason analysis.   Sullivan\n\nresponded, and the district  court agreed, that a jury  cannot be\n\nasked to  compare what  are essentially  apples and  oranges, and\n\nthat  it  is  impossible  to  conduct  a  balancing   of  alleged\n\nanticompetitive   and  procompetitive  effects  of  a  challenged\n\npractice in every definable market.\n\n          The issue of  defining the  proper scope of  a rule  of\n\nreason  analysis  is  a   deceptive  body  of  water,  containing\n\nunforeseen currents  and turbulence lying just  below the surface\n\nof an  otherwise calm and peaceful ocean.  The waters are muddied\n\nby  the Supreme  Court's  decision in  NCAA --  one  of the  more\n                                           \n\nextensive  examples of  the  Court performing  a  rule of  reason\n\nanalysis  -- where  the  Court considered  the  value of  certain\n\nprocompetitive  effects  that  existed outside  of  the  relevant\n\nmarket in which the restraint operated.  NCAA, 468 U.S. at 115-20\n                                             \n\n(considering the NCAA's interest in protecting live attendance at\n\nuntelevised  games  and  the  NCAA's  \"legitimate and  important\"\n\ninterest  in  maintaining  competitive  balance  between  amateur\n\n                               -47-\n\nathletic teams  as a justification for a  restraint that operated\n\nin a completely different market,  the market for the telecasting\n\nof collegiate  football games).9  Other  courts have demonstrated\n\nsimilar confusion.  See,  e.g., L.A. Coliseum, 726 F.2d  at 1381,\n                                             \n\n1392, 1397, 1399 (stating that the \"relevant  market provides the\n\nbasis on which to  balance competitive harms and benefits  of the\n\nrestraint  at  issue\"  but then  considering  a  wide variety  of\n\nalleged  benefits,  and then  directing  the  finder  of fact  to\n\n\"balance the gain  to interbrand competition against  the loss of\n\nintrabrand  competition\",  where  the  two types  of  competition\n\noperated in different markets).\n\n          To our  knowledge, no authority  has squarely addressed\n\nthis  issue.   On  the one  hand,  several courts  have expressed\n\nconcern  over the  use of  wide ranging  interests to  justify an\n\notherwise  anticompetitive   practice,  and  others   have  found\n\nparticular  justifications   to  be   incomparable  and   not  in\n\ncorrelation  with the alleged restraint  of trade.   Smith v. Pro\n                                                                 \n\nFootball,  Inc., 593 F.2d 1173,  1186 (D.C. Cir.  1978); Brown v.\n                                                              \n\nPro Football, Inc., 812 F. Supp. 237, 238 (D.D.C. 1992);  Chicago\n                                                                 \n\nPro. Sports Ltd. Partnership v.

Therefore, it is impossible to tell whether the\nCourt  was consciously applying the  rule of reason  to include a\nbroad area of procompetitive benefits in a variety of markets, or\nwhether  the  Court  was  simply  not  being  very  careful   and\ninadvertently extended  the rule of reason past its proper scope.\nThere is certainly no  language, as Sullivan suggests, indicating\nthat   the  Court   was  considering   the  alleged   benefit  of\n\"competitive   balance\"  only   to   the  extent   that  it   had\nprocompetitive  effects  in  the  market  for  televised football\ngames.\n\n                               -48-\n\nSupp. 1336, 1358  (N.D.Ill. 1991).   We agree  that the  ultimate\n\nquestion  under  the  rule  of reason  is  whether  a  challenged\n\npractice  promotes or  suppresses  competition.   Thus, it  seems\n\nimproper to validate a practice that is decidedly in restraint of\n\ntrade  simply  because  the  practice  produces  some   unrelated\n\nbenefits to competition in another market.\n\n          On  the other  hand,  several  courts,  including  this\n\nCircuit, have found it  appropriate in some cases to  balance the\n\nanticompetitive effects on competition in one market with certain\n\nprocompetitive benefits  in other markets.  See,  e.g., NCAA, 468\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  at 115-20; Grappone, Inc.  v.

Moreover, the\n        \n\ndistrict court's  argument that it would be impossible to compare\n\nthe procompetitive effects of the NFL's  policy in the interbrand\n                                                            \n\nmarket  of  competition  between  the  NFL  and  other  forms  of\n\nentertainment, with the anticompetitive effects of the intrabrand\n                                                            \n\nmarket of competition  between NFL  teams for the  sale of  their\n\nownership interests,  is arguably refuted by  the Supreme Court's\n\nholding  in Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n36 (1977).  Continental  T.V. explicitly recognized that positive\n                             \n\neffects on  interbrand  competition can  justify  anticompetitive\n                 \n\neffects  on intrabrand  competition.   Id.  at  51-59.   Although\n                                         \n\nContinental T.V. can reasonably  be interpreted as referring only\n                \n\nto  interbrand and  intrabrand  components of  the same  relevant\n                                                                 \n\n                               -49-\n\nmarket, Hornsby Oil  Co., Inc.  v.

Continental T.V., 433 U.S. at 52\n                                                 \n\nn.19 (\"The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent\n\nof the  level of interbrand competition.\").  Arguably, the market\n\nput forward by the NFL -- that is the market for NFL  football in\n\ncompetition  with  other forms  of  entertainment  -- is  closely\n\nrelated to the  relevant market found  by the jury such  that the\n\nprocompetitive   benefits  in   one  can   be  compared   to  the\n\nanticompetitive harms  in the other.   Clearly this  question can\n\nonly be answered  upon a much more in-depth  inquiry that we need\n\nnot, nor find it appropriate to, embark upon at this time.   \n\n          Finally,  we  note  that although  balancing  harms and\n\nbenefits in different markets may be unwieldy and confusing, such\n\nis the case with a number of balancing tests that a court or jury\n\nis expected to  apply all  the time.   Indeed, Justice  Brandeis'\n\nfamous formulation of the rule of reason seems to contemplate the\n\nbalancing of  a wide variety of factors  and considerations, many\n\nof which are not necessarily comparable or correlative:\n\n            The true  test of legality is whether the\n            restraint  imposed  is  such   as  merely\n            regulates  and  perhaps thereby  promotes\n            competition or whether it is such as  may\n            suppress or even destroy competition.  To\n            determine  that  question the  court must\n            ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to\n            the  business to  which the  restraint is\n            applied; its condition  before and  after\n            the restraint was  imposed; the nature of\n            the  restraint and its  effect, actual or\n            probable.   The history of the restraint,\n\n                               -50-\n\n            the  evil believed  to exist,  the reason\n            for adopting the  particular remedy,  the\n            purpose or end sought to be attained, are\n            all relevant facts.\n\nBoard of  Trade of the City of Chicago v. United States, 246 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n231, 238 (1918).\n\n          Although the issue of  the proper scope of the  rule of\n\nreason analysis is more appropriately resolved in a case where it\n\nis  dispositive and more fully briefed, we  can draw at least one\n\ngeneral conclusion from  the caselaw at this point: courts should\n\ngenerally give a measure of  latitude to antitrust defendants  in\n\ntheir efforts  to explain  the procompetitive justifications  for\n\ntheir  policies  and  practices;   however,  courts  should  also\n\nmaintain some  vigilance by excluding justifications  that are so\n\nunrelated  to  the challenged  practice  that  they amount  to  a\n\ncollateral  attempt to  salvage a practice  that is  decidedly in\n\nrestraint of trade. \n\n          In any event, we need not enter these  dangerous waters\n\nto  resolve the  instant dispute.    The NFL  wanted the  jury to\n\nconsider its  proffered justifications  for the  public ownership\n\npolicy  -- namely that the  policy enhanced the  NFL's ability to\n\neffectively produce and  present a popular entertainment  product\n\nunimpaired by  the  conflicting interests  that public  ownership\n\nwould  cause.   These  procompetitive justifications  should have\n\nbeen  considered by the jury, even under Sullivan's theory of the\n\nproper scope of the rule  of reason analysis.  As we point out in\n\nnote [4] above, and as Sullivan himself points out, to the extent\n\nthe NFL's  policy strengthens and improves  the league, resulting\n\n                               -51-\n\nin increased competition in the market for ownership interests in\n\nNFL clubs through, for example, more valuable teams, the jury may\n\nconsider the NFL's justifications as relevant factors in its rule\n\nof  reason analysis.  The danger of the proffered instructions on\n\nthe verdict  form is  that they  may have  mislead the  jury into\n\nthinking  that  it  was  precluded  from  considering  the  NFL's\n\njustifications for its ownership policy.  Therefore, the relevant\n\nmarket  language on the verdict  form should be  removed, or else\n\nthe  jury  should  be  informed  that  evidence  of  benefits  to\n\ncompetition  in  the  relevant  market can  include  evidence  of\n\nbenefits flowing indirectly from the public ownership policy that\n\nultimately  have  a  beneficial  impact  on  competition  in  the\n\nrelevant market itself.\n\n     E.  References to Prior Antitrust Cases Against the NFL\n\n          Despite  a  pretrial  motion  in  limine  and  repeated\n                                                  \n\nobjections by the  NFL, the  district court allowed  the jury  to\n\nhear  numerous references  to prior  antitrust cases  against the\n\nNFL.  Evidence about prior  antitrust violations by the defendant\n\nmay, in  appropriate cases,  be  admissible to  show things  like\n\nmarket  power,  intent  to   monopolize,  motive,  or  method  of\n\nconspiracy.

In many of\n               \n\nthe  instances where Sullivan  or his counsel  made references to\n\nprior antitrust cases  at trial, Sullivan failed  to satisfy this\n\nburden.\n\n          Sullivan argues  that  the prior  cases  were  relevant\n\neither to  certain testimony regarding the  reasonableness of the\n\nNFL's ownership policy and voting requirements or to the issue of\n\ndefining  the  relevant  market.    Because  none  of  the  cases\n\nmentioned at  trial concerned the NFL's ownership policy at issue\n\nhere,  evidence of  those  prior cases  is  not relevant  to  the\n\nreasonableness of the NFL's policy against public ownership.  The\n\ngeneral voting requirements are not in dispute, so cases touching\n\nsolely upon them are also not relevant.  Certain limited portions\n\nof  some prior antitrust decisions  are relevant to  the issue of\n\ndefining the  relevant market.   The testimony and  commentary at\n\ntrial  concerning these prior cases,  however, was not limited to\n\nthe relevant market portions of these cases and, on the contrary,\n\nfocussed  primarily on  the  issue of  whether  the NFL's  public\n\nownership policy was  unreasonable.  As  such, that evidence  was\n\nprejudicial,  without  any  balancing  relevance  to  justify its\n\n                               -53-\n\nadmission into evidence.\n\n          The references to prior NFL cases were made in a number\n\nof different  contexts during the trial  (including during direct\n\nexamination,  cross-examination,  and at  closing  argument), and\n\nthey  contained  a  variety  of  different  information.    These\n\nreferences  are not likely to  be repeated in  precisely the same\n\ncontext  upon  a new  trial.   Therefore, instead  of identifying\n\nwhich particular  pieces of evidence were  inadmissible, we think\n\nit  would be  more  useful  to  point  out  more  generally  that\n\nreferences to prior  NFL cases are not  relevant to the  issue of\n\nthe reasonableness of the NFL's  public ownership policy and such\n\nreferences should  be excluded if they  contain information about\n\nthe unreasonableness of other  policies of the NFL which  were at\n\nissue in the other cases.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n                               \n\n                               -54-\n",

The National Football League\n                                  \n\nand twenty-one  organizations owning NFL franchises  (referred to\n\ncollectively as  the \"NFL\")  appeal the judgment  entered against\n\nthem  after a jury found that the NFL violated the antitrust laws\n\nby  restricting  owners of  member  football  clubs from  selling\n\nshares in their teams to the public.  Plaintiff-appellee, William\n\nH. Sullivan, former  owner of the  New England Patriots  football\n\nteam  (the \"Patriots\"),  was awarded  a total  of $51  million in\n\ndamages for the losses Sullivan incurred when he had to  sell the\n\nPatriots  to a  private buyer  after the  NFL prevented  him from\n\noffering 49%  of the team to  the public in the  form of publicly\n\ntraded stock.  Because  several prejudicial errors were committed\n\nduring the trial,  we vacate  the judgment and  remand for a  new\n\ntrial.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Under  Article 3.5  of the  NFL's constitution  and by-\n\nlaws,  three-quarters of  the NFL  club  owners must  approve all\n\ntransfers  of ownership  interests  in an  NFL  team, other  than\n\ntransfers within a  family.  In conjunction with this  rule is an\n\nuncodified policy against  the sale of ownership  interests in an\n\nNFL  club to  the  public through  offerings  of publicly  traded\n\nstock.  The  members, however, retain  full authority to  approve\n\nany given transfer by a three-quarters vote  according to Article\n\n3.5.\n\n          Sullivan  owned the Patriots  from the team's inception\n\nin  1959 until  October  of  1988.    When  Sullivan  formed  the\n\n                               -2-\n\nPatriots, he and his  partner sold non-voting shares of  the team\n\nto the public beginning in 1960.  At that time, the Patriots were\n\nin  the old American Football League  (\"AFL\"), which was separate\n\nfrom the NFL, and which had no policy against public ownership of\n\nteams.  In  1966, the AFL and  the old NFL  merged into a  single\n\nleague.  Under  the terms of the merger, the  new NFL would adopt\n\nthe old NFL's  policy against  public ownership.   The  Patriots,\n\nhowever, were allowed  to retain their level of  public ownership\n\nas a special exception to the rule under a grandfather clause.\n\n          In 1976,  Sullivan sought to acquire  the publicly held\n\nshares of  the Patriots through a  merger of the club  into a new\n\nSullivan-owned company.   Stockholders approved  the transfer and\n\nthe  transaction  was  subsequently  consummated,  although  some\n\nshareholders   subsequently   brought   suit,   challenging   the\n\nsufficiency of the purchase  price.  After protracted litigation,\n\nthe shareholders  obtained a  judgment requiring Sullivan  to pay\n\nthem a higher price for their shares.  The Patriots then became a\n\nfully privately owned club.\n\n          Sullivan  and his  son, Chuck  Sullivan, who  owned the\n\nstadium where the Patriots  played, began to experience financial\n\ndifficulties  and increasing debt burdens in  the mid-1980s.  The\n\nSullivans decided that  they needed to raise capital to alleviate\n\ntheir financial problems.   After the Boston Celtics professional\n\nbasketball franchise made a public offering of 40% of the team in\n\nDecember  of 1986, the Sullivans decided to pursue a similar deal\n\nwith the Patriots in order  to raise cash to cover some  of their\n\n                               -3-\n\ndebts.\n\n          On October  19, 1987, the Sullivans  met with Stephens,\n\nInc.,  a small investment banking firm  in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThey discussed a  debt financing deal whereby Stephens would loan\n\nthe  Sullivans  $80  million  dollars,  with  half going  to  the\n\nPatriots  and the  other half  to Chuck Sullivan's  company which\n\nowned the Patriots' stadium.   The Patriots' portion of  the loan\n\nwould  be repaid out  of the proceeds  of the sale of  49% of the\n\nPatriots through the  offering of public stock.   Stephens agreed\n\nto  look into the possibility of arranging the deal, but informed\n\nthe Sullivans that  they would  first have to  get NFL  approval.\n\nSullivan ultimately never obtained NFL approval and the deal with\n\nStephens never progressed beyond some preliminary discussions.\n\n          At a meeting  of the  NFL owners on  October 27,  1987,\n\nSullivan raised his  stock sale  idea with the  other owners  and\n\nasked  for  a modification  of  the NFL's  policy  against public\n\nownership  to  allow for  certain  controlled  sales of  minority\n\ninterests  in NFL  clubs.   Alternatively,  Sullivan requested  a\n\nwaiver  from the  public  ownership policy  for his  contemplated\n\npublic  offering  of  the   Patriots.    Sullivan's  request  was\n\neventually tabled  at this meeting.   Discussions continued among\n\nthe  owners  and, at  one point,  Sullivan counted  17 of  the 21\n\nowners needed for  approval as being in favor  of allowing him to\n\nmake  his public  offering (seven  owners were  still undecided).\n\nPete Rozelle, NFL Commissioner  at the time, told  Sullivans that\n\nhe  was  not in  favor of  Sullivan's  proposals and  that league\n\n                               -4-\n\napproval was \"very dubious.\"  Sullivan ultimately never asked for\n\na vote on amending  the ownership policy or on waiving the policy\n\nfor the Patriots,  and the NFL never held such  a vote.  Sullivan\n\nclaims that he did not ask for a  vote because it would have been\n\nfutile.\n\n          In  October of  1988,  Sullivan sold  the Patriots  for\n\napproximately  $83.7  million to  KMS  Patriots  L.P. (\"KMS\"),  a\n\nlimited  partnership owned  by  Victor Kiam  and Francis  Murray.\n\nSullivan alleges that, absent  the NFL's public ownership policy,\n\nhe  would have been able to retain  a majority share of a rapidly\n\nappreciating  asset with  a  high potential  for future  profits.\n\nInstead,  Sullivan asserts, he was forced to sell the Patriots at\n\na depressed price to private buyers.\n\n          On May 16, 1991, Sullivan  sued the NFL claiming  that,\n\namong other  things, the NFL  had violated the  Sherman Antitrust\n\nAct, 15 U.S.C.    1-2, by preventing him from selling  49% of the\n\nPatriots to the public  in an equity offering.   Sullivan alleged\n\nthat, as a  result, he was forced  to sell the  entire team to  a\n\nprivate  buyer at a fire sale price  in order to pay off existing\n\ndebts.  Prior  to trial, the district  court dismissed Sullivan's\n\nclaim under    2 of the Sherman Act along  with various state law\n\nclaims.   After  a trial  on Sullivan's  claim under    1  of the\n\nSherman  Act, the  jury rendered  a verdict  for Sullivan  in the\n\namount of  $38 million,  which the  judge  later reduced  through\n\nremittitur  to $17 million.   Pursuant to  15 U.S.C.    15, which\n\nprovides for  treble damages for antitrust  violations, the court\n\n                               -5-\n\nentered a final judgment for Sullivan of $51 million.\n\n                               -6-\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\n\n          The  NFL  has  raised  a number  of  issues  on  appeal\n\nconcerning the application of   1 of the Sherman Act to the facts\n\nof this case, which, according to the NFL, entitle it to judgment\n\nas a matter  of law.  We address these issues first to see if the\n\npresent case should be dismissed, and we ultimately conclude that\n\nit should  not.  We next  address the NFL's  allegations of trial\n\nerror and we  find that several of them require  that we overturn\n\nthe verdict in this case and order a new trial.\n\n          The first  set of issues involves  the district court's\n\ndenial of the NFL's motions for judgment as a matter of law under\n\nFed. R.  Civ. P.  50.   We review the  court's decision  de novo,\n                                                                \n\nusing the same stringent decisional standards that controlled the\n\ndistrict court.

The league's attack is two-fold,\n\nasserting (1)  that NFL clubs do not  compete with each other for\n\nthe sale of ownership interests in their teams so there exists no\n\ncompetition  to be injured in  the first place;  and (2) Sullivan\n\ndid not present sufficient evidence of injury to competition from\n\nwhich  a reasonable  jury could  conclude that  the  NFL's policy\n\nrestrains   trade.

To put it  another way, the  NFL's public ownership\n\npolicy allegedly does  not merely prevent the  replacement of one\n\nclub owner with another -- an action having little evident effect\n\non  competition --  it compromises  the entire  process by  which\n\ncompetition for club ownership occurs.2\n\n                    \n\n2   This same argument  distinguishes cases cited by  the NFL for\nthe  proposition that  a franchisor's  disapproval of  a proposed\nsale of  a franchise does not  give rise to  an antitrust injury.\nSee  Kestenbaum v.

As we  have  already  noted, NFL  member  clubs\n\ncompete in several ways off the field, which itself tends to show\n\nthat the teams pursue diverse interests and thus are not a single\n\nenterprise under   1.\n\n          Ultimately,  the NFL's Copperweld challenge is subsumed\n                                           \n\nunder the question of whether  or not the evidence can support  a\n\nfinding that NFL teams compete against each other for the sale of\n\ntheir  ownership interests.   Proof  of such  competition defeats\n\nboth  the  NFL's  challenge to  the  existence  of  an injury  to\n\ncompetition  and   the   NFL's  Copperweld   argument  as   well.\n                                          \n\nInsufficient proof  of such competition would  require a judgment\n\nin  favor of the NFL anyway, regardless of the implications under\n\nCopperweld.  As we  discuss below, the jury's finding  that there\n          \n\nexists  competition  between  teams  for the  sale  of  ownership\n\ninterests was based on sufficient evidence.\n\n          2.  Insufficient Evidence of Harm to Competition\n                                                          \n\n          The   NFL  contends  that   Sullivan  did  not  present\n\nsufficient evidence concerning: (1) the existence of  competition\n\n                               -15-\n\nbetween NFL clubs  for the sale of ownership  interests, or (2) a\n\ndecrease in output,  an increase in prices,  a detrimental effect\n\non  efficiency or other incidents  of harm to  competition in the\n\nrelevant market, from which a reasonable jury could conclude that\n\nthe NFL's policy injured competition.  Although we agree that the\n\nevidence  of all these factors  is rather thin,  we disagree that\n\nthe evidence  is too thin to support a jury verdict in Sullivan's\n\nfavor. \n\n          With   respect  to   evidence  of   the  existence   of\n\ncompetition  for   the  sale  of  ownership   interests,  one  of\n\nSullivan's experts, Professor Roger  Noll, testified that \"one of\n\nthe ways in which the NFL exercises monopoly power in the  market\n\nfor  the franchises and ownership  is by excluding certain people\n\nfrom owning  all or part --  any type part of  an NFL franchise.\"\n\nDr.  Noll explained that this \"enables a group of owners, in this\n\ncase, you only need eight owners,  to exclude from the League and\n\nfrom  competing with  them, people  who  might be  more effective\n\ncompetitors than they are.\"   The record also contains statements\n\nfrom several NFL owners which could reasonably be interpreted  as\n\nexpressions of concern about their  ability to compete with other\n\nteams  in the market for  investment capital in  general, and for\n\nthe  sale of  ownership interests  in particular.    For example,\n\nArthur  Rooney II of the  Pittsburgh Steelers stated  in a letter\n\nthat  he did not \"believe  that the individually  or family owned\n\nteams  will  be able  to compete  with the  consolidated groups.\"\n\nRalph  Wilson of the  Buffalo Bills stated  that big corporations\n\n                               -16-\n\nshould not own teams because it gives them an \"unfair competitive\n\nadvantage\" over other teams  since corporations will funnel money\n\ninto  the  team and  make it  \"more  competitive\" than  the other\n\nfranchises.   Former NFL Commissioner Pete  Rozelle admitted that\n\nsimilar sentiments had been expressed by NFL members.\n\n          Although   it   is  not   precisely   clear  that   the\n\n\"competition\"  about   which  Noll,   Rooney,  and  Wilson   were\n\ndiscussing  is  the same  competition at  issue  here --  that is\n\ncompetition for the sale  of ownership interests -- a  jury could\n\nreasonably interpret these statements as expressing a belief that\n\nthe competition  exists between teams  for the sale  of ownership\n\ninterests.    The statements  of the  two  NFL owners  imply that\n\ngreater access  to  capital  for all  teams  will  put  increased\n\npressure on some teams  to compete with others for  that capital,\n\nand  all   the  statements  reveal  that   the  ownership  rules,\n\nparticularly  the  rule against  public  ownership,  is the  main\n\nobstacle  preventing such  access.   The  fact that  ownership by\n\n\"consolidated  groups\"  is not  necessarily  the  same as  public\n\nownership  does  not  affect   the  conclusion  that  teams  face\n\ncompetitive   pressure  in  selling   their  ownership  interests\n\ngenerally to whoever  might buy them.  We also note that evidence\n\nof  actual, present competition is  not necessary as  long as the\n\nevidence shows that the potential for competition exists.  See L.\n                                                                 \n\nA.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430940\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Coliseum,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/430940/los-angeles-memorial-coliseum-commission-v-national-football-league-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  at  <span class=\"page\">1394</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (discussing  significance  of\n            \n\npotential  competition, especially where challenged policy limits\n         \n\nsuch  competition so  that it  is not evident  in practice).   It\n\n                               -17-\n\nwould  be   difficult  indeed  to  provide   direct  evidence  of\n\ncompetition when the NFL effectively prohibits it. \n\n          The  NFL  focusses  on  the fact  that  Professor  Noll\n\ntestified that many of the purchasers of Patriots' stock would be\n\nNew England  sports fans and others in the New England area.  The\n\nNFL points  out that other  NFL teams would not  compete with the\n\nPatriots for the sale of stock to their own fans.   This argument\n\nslightly  distorts Professor  Noll's testimony.   Professor  Noll\n\nstated that local  souvenir buyers  would be one  portion of  the\n\nmarket for Patriots stock.  Professor Noll also testified several\n\ntimes  that other investors would buy Patriots stock as well, for\n\ninvestment  purposes.  Noll's point was  that the souvenir buyers\n\nwould serve to bid up the price of the stock above what the price\n\nwould  normally be if  the Patriots were a  regular company.  His\n\ntestimony  did not  preclude  a finding  that  NFL teams  compete\n\nagainst  each  other  for  investment  capital via  the  sale  of\n\nownership interests.\n\n          The record  also  contains sufficient  evidence of  the\n\nnormal incidents of injury to competition from the NFL's policy -\n\n- reduced output, increased prices,  and reduced efficiency -- to\n\nsupport the  jury's verdict.   As  Dr. Noll  pointed  out in  his\n\ntestimony, the NFL's policy \"excludes individuals . . . who might\n\nwant to own a  share of stock  in a professional football  team.\"\n\nSeveral  NFL  officials  themselves  admitted   that  the  policy\n\nrestricts  the market  for  investment capital  among NFL  teams.\n\nThere  is thus  little dispute  that  the NFL's  ownership policy\n\n                               -18-\n\nreduces the available output of ownership interests.\n\n          The NFL is correct that, in one sense, the overall pool\n\nof potential output is fixed because there are  only 28 NFL teams\n\nand, although their  value may fluctuate,  the quantity of  their\n\nownership interests cannot.   However, the NFL's public ownership\n\npolicy completely  wipes out a certain type of ownership interest\n\n-- public  ownership of stock.  By restricting output in one form\n                                                                 \n\nof ownership, the NFL is thereby reducing the output of ownership\n\ninterests  overall.    In  other  words,  the  NFL  is  literally\n\nrestricting the output of a product -- a share in an NFL team.\n\n          There  was considerable testimony  concerning the price\n\neffects  of the NFL policy.  Both of Sullivan's experts testified\n\nthat the policy depressed the price of ownership interests in NFL\n\nteams because NFL franchises would normally command  a premium on\n\nthe  public market relative to their value in the private market,\n\nwhich is all that  the league currently permits.   Professor Noll\n\ntestified that fan loyalty  would push up the price  of ownership\n\ninterests  if  sales to  the public  were  allowed.   Even former\n\nCommissioner Pete Rozelle acknowledged  that \"it was pointed out,\n\nwith  justification,  it  has  been over  the  years,  that  [the\n\nownership policy] does restrict your market and, very likely, the\n\nprice you  could get for one  of our franchises if  you wanted to\n\nsell it, because  you are eliminating a very broad market . . . .\n\nAnd they have  said that there is a depression  on the price they\n\ncould get for their franchise.\"\n\n          The NFL  points  out that  the  alleged effect  of  its\n\n                               -19-\n\nownership  policy is  to  reduce  prices  of NFL  team  ownership\n                                \n\ninterests,  rather than  to raise  prices which  is normally  the\n\nmeasure of an injury to competition.

The Supreme Court  has emphasized, however,\n\nthat overall consumer preferences in setting output and prices is\n\nmore  important than higher prices  and lower output,  per se, in\n                                                             \n\ndetermining  whether there  has  been an  injury to  competition.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111239\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">NCAA,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111239/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-of-okla/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.   In this  case, regardless of  the exact\n    \n\nprice  effects of the NFL's policy, the overall market effects of\n\nthe  policy  are  plainly  unresponsive to  consumer  demand  for\n\nownership interests in NFL  teams.  Dr. Noll testified  that fans\n\nare interested in  buying shares in NFL teams and  that the NFL's\n\npolicy deprives  fans of  this product.   Moreover, evidence  was\n\npresented concerning  the public  offering of the  Boston Celtics\n\nprofessional  basketball  team which  demonstrated,  according to\n\nsome  of  the testimony,  fan  interest  in buying  ownership  of\n\nprofessional  sports teams.  Thus, a jury could conclude that the\n\nNFL's policy  injured competition  by making the  relevant market\n\n\"unresponsive to consumer preference.\"  Id.3\n                                          \n\n                    \n\n3   The  NFL maintains  that price  and output  are not  affected\nbecause its ownership policy  does not limit the number  of games\nor  teams, does  not raise ticket  prices or  the prices  of game\ntelecasts  and does not affect  the normal consumer  of the NFL's\nproduct in any  other way.   Such facts might  be relevant to  an\n\n                               -20-\n\n          As for overall efficiency of production in the relevant\n\nmarket,4  Sullivan's  experts  testified that  the  NFL's  policy\n\nhindered  efficiency  gains, and  that allowing  public ownership\n\nwould make for better football teams.  Professor Noll stated that\n\nthe NFL's public ownership policy prevented individuals who might\n\nbe \"more  efficient and  much better  at  running a  professional\n\nfootball  team\" from  owning teams.   Dr.  Noll also  stated that\n\npublicly owned  NFL teams  would be better  managed, and  produce\n\nhigher quality entertainment  for the fans.   Noll testified that\n\nthe  ownership  rule   excluded  certain   types  of   management\n\nstructures which  would likely be  more efficient in  running the\n\nteams,  resulting in  higher  franchise values.   One  NFL owner,\n\nLamar  Hunt, acknowledged  that increased  access to  capital can\n\nimprove  a  team's  operations  and performance.    A  memorandum\n\nprepared  by an NFL staff member stated that changes to the NFL's\n\n                    \n\ninquiry of whether the NFL's policy harms overall efficiency, see\n                                                                 \ninfra note  [4], but  it is not  relevant to  whether the  policy\n     \naffects output  and prices in  the relevant market  for ownership\n                                                  \ninterests.   Just  because consumers  of \"NFL  football\" are  not\naffected  by output  controls and price  increases does  not mean\nthat  consumers of a  product in the  relevant market  are not so\naffected.   In  this  case, two  types  of consumers  are  denied\nproducts  by the NFL policy:  consumers who want  to buy stock of\nthe Patriots or other teams, and consumers like Sullivan who want\nto  \"purchase\"  investment  capital  in  the  market  for  public\nfinancing.\n\n4   Although  the product  at  issue in  the  relevant market  is\n\"ownership interests,\" efficiency  in production of  that product\ncan be measured by the value of the ownership interest.  That is,\nan improved  product produced more efficiently  will be reflected\nin the value of the output in question (regardless of the price).\nIn this case, the value of  the product depends on the success of\nthe  Patriots'  football  team,  the overall  efficiency  of  its\noperations, and the success of the NFL in general. \n\n                               -21-\n\npublic ownership  policy could contribute to each  NFL team's own\n\nfinancial strength and viability, which in turn would benefit the\n\nentire NFL because  the league  has a strong  interest in  having\n\nstrong, viable teams.\n\n          The  NFL presented a  large amount  of evidence  to the\n\ncontrary and  now claims on  appeal that Sullivan's  position was\n\nbased on nothing more  than sheer speculation.  We  have reviewed\n\nthe record, however,  and we cannot say that the  evidence was so\n\noverwhelming that no  reasonable jury could find  against the NFL\n\nand in favor  of Sullivan.  We therefore refuse to enter judgment\n\nin favor of the NFL as a matter of law.\n\n                      B.  Ancillary Benefits\n\n          The  NFL next argues that  even if its public ownership\n\npolicy  injures competition in  a relevant  market, it  should be\n\nupheld as ancillary to the legitimate joint activity that is \"NFL\n                   \n\nfootball\" and thus not violative of the Sherman Act.   We take no\n\nissue  with the  proposition that  certain joint  ventures enable\n\nseparate business entities to  combine their skills and resources\n\nin pursuit of a common goal that cannot be effectively pursued by\n\nthe  venturers acting alone.

We\n                           \n\nfurther  accept,   for  purposes  of  this   appeal,  that  rules\n\ncontrolling who  may join a joint  venture can be ancillary  to a\n\nlegitimate joint activity and  that the NFL's own policy  against\n\npublic  ownership constitutes  one example  of such  an ancillary\n      \n\nrule.    Finally,  we accept  the  NFL's  claim  that its  public\n\nownership  policy  contributes  to  the ability  of  the  NFL  to\n\nfunction  as an  effective  sports  league,  and that  the  NFL's\n\nfunctioning  would  be  impaired  if publicly  owned  teams  were\n\npermitted, because the short-term  dividend interests of a club's\n\nshareholder would often conflict  with the long-term interests of\n\nthe league  as a whole.  That is, the policy avoids a detrimental\n\nconflict of interests between team shareholders and the league.\n\n          We disagree, however, that these factors are sufficient\n\nto  establish as a matter of  law that the NFL's ownership policy\n\ndoes not unreasonably restrain trade  in violation of   1  of the\n\nSherman Act.

Although  the evidence  of\n\ncausation is  not overwhelming, it is  nevertheless sufficient to\n\nsupport the verdict.\n\n          Regarding  the NFL's  first  claim that  Sullivan never\n\ncalled for  a  vote  from  the  owners to  change  or  waive  the\n\nownership policy,  Sullivan presented sufficient evidence to show\n\nthat the NFL essentially rejected Sullivan's request, even though\n\nno  official  vote was  taken.

Certainly, if  Sullivan can\n\nprove  futility independent of any official  request, he need not\n\nshow that he  actually called for  a vote  and received a  denial\n\nfrom the other NFL owners.\n\n          The jury in this  case heard evidence that would  allow\n\nit to conclude that the NFL effectively denied Sullivan's request\n\nfor a waiver  or amendment  of the public  ownership policy,  and\n\n                               -27-\n\nthat an official  vote would indeed have been  futile.  The NFL's\n\npolicy against public ownership was long-standing, and the policy\n\nwithstood  several  efforts  to  change  it  over  the  years  as\n\nproffered  amendment  proposals were  never  brought  to a  vote.\n\nSullivan requested a wavier of, or  amendment to, the policy at a\n\nmeeting  of the  owners  on October  27, 1987.   His  request was\n\ntabled.     After  further  discussions,  then-Commissioner  Pete\n\nRozelle  said that he opposed  the proposal and  that the chances\n\nfor league approval  were \"very dubious.\"   Although Sullivan was\n\nonly four  votes shy  of winning a  vote, with seven  votes still\n\nundecided, the jury  could reasonably conclude that,  in light of\n\nthe  Commissioner's  statement,  Sullivan  tried  but  failed  to\n\nconvince those undecided owners  to vote in his favor and that an\n\nactual  vote  would  have been  futile.    The  evidence is  thus\n\nsufficient  to support  a  finding  that  the  NFL's  policy  was\n\neffectively enforced against Sullivan and that  the policy did in\n\nfact, when considered with  the evidence discussed below, prevent\n\nSullivan from making his public offering of 49% of the Patriots.\n\n          Sullivan  also presented sufficient evidence to support\n\na  finding that  the Patriots  stock sale  was both  feasible and\n\npotentially  successful.   Sullivan met  with Stephens,  Inc., an\n\ninvestment banking firm, to discuss a deal whereby Stephens would\n\narrange for a loan of  $80 million to Sullivan and his  son, half\n\nof which would  be paid back out of the  proceeds of the Patriots\n\nstock  offering,  which  Stephens  would  also  arrange.    In  a\n\nsubsequent letter, Stephens  stated that it had been  retained to\n\n                               -28-\n\nassist in the \"private placement of $80 million of debt\" and  set\n\nout some preliminary terms and conditions.  Although specifics of\n\nthe  public offering  were  not discussed,  and Stephens  did not\n\ndetermine whether  the  stock offering  was ultimately  feasible,\n\nStephens repeatedly made it clear  to Sullivan that NFL  approval\n\nwas  required --  indeed  Stephens specifically  singled out  NFL\n\napproval as the prerequisite -- before Stephens could proceed any\n               \n\nfurther with  efforts to  prepare for the  placement of  Patriots\n\nstock.\n\n          As discussed above,  NFL approval  was never  obtained.\n\nTherefore,  the jury could conclude that lack of approval was the\n\nreason  Stephens was  unwilling  to proceed  with the  deal, even\n\nthough  Stephens  also expressed  some  concern about  Sullivan's\n\nfinancial and legal troubles.  The jury also heard testimony that\n\nCharles Allen, a prominent investment banker in New York, thought\n\nthe  Patriots  public  offering  was  feasible and  that  he  was\n\npotentially interested  in arranging the deal.   Sullivan himself\n\ntestified  that  the  stock  sale   was  feasible  based  on  his\n\nexperience with the previous public offering of Patriots stock in\n\n1960, and based  on the  public offering of  the Boston  Celtics.\n\nFinally, one of Sullivan's experts, Patrick Brake, testified that\n\nthe  public offering  would have  been feasible  had the  NFL not\n\nblocked it.\n\n          In  addition, despite  significant financial  and legal\n\nproblems with the Patriots, the evidence is sufficient to support\n\na finding that Sullivan  could have solved these problems  in the\n\n                               -29-\n\ncourse  of the public offering  and, further, that  he could have\n\nbrought off a  successful stock  sale that would  have raised  at\n\nleast $70 million.\n\n          The NFL focusses its challenge to the potential success\n\nof  Sullivan's offering on  the testimony  of Patrick  Brake, who\n\nprovided the $70 million figure as the value for  the stock sale.\n\nAccording to the  NFL, Brake's  testimony could  not support  the\n\njury's finding on causation  because it was not supported  by any\n\nfacts,  it was not grounded  in any rational  methodology, and it\n\nignored important factors  indicating that the Patriots  offering\n\nwould  not  be  a  success.    The NFL  does  not  challenge  the\n\nadmissibility of  Brake's opinion  but, instead, claims  that his\n\nopinion cannot support the jury's finding that the Patriots stock\n\nsale  would have  been a  success if  the NFL  had allowed  it to\n\nhappen.\n\n          \"When an expert opinion  is not supported by sufficient\n\nfacts to validate it in the eyes of the law, or when indisputable\n\nrecord   facts  contradict  or   otherwise  render   the  opinion\n\nunreasonable, it cannot support a jury's verdict.\"  Brooke Group,\n                                                                 \n\nLtd. v.

To begin with, Brake  stated in his testimony that  his\n\nopinion was based on a review of documents and depositions in the\n\ncase,  a review of the  prospectus for the  Boston Celtics public\n\noffering,  the  fact  that  future television  revenues  for  the\n\nPatriots were likely to increase due to  the Patriots' appearance\n\nin the  Super Bowl, and  the fact that  the public stock  for NFL\n\nteams, like the  Patriots, would  trade at a  premium value  over\n\nwhat  the club would otherwise be  worth.  Brake also stated that\n\nhe  looked at  a  financial statement  of  the Patriots  and  was\n\napprised of some of the debt and loss history of the club.  Other\n\ntestimony and evidence at trial supported the claim that stock of\n\nNFL teams would  sell for a premium above the club's private sale\n\nvalue  and  the claim  that TV  revenues to  the NFL  teams would\n\nincrease.   Sullivan  himself  testified that  a public  offering\n\nwould  be successful  based  upon  the  success  of  his  earlier\n\noffering  of Patriots  stock and  on the  results of  the Celtics\n\npublic  offering.  There  was also testimony  -- highly disputed,\n\n                               -31-\n\nbut potentially  credible testimony nonetheless --  to the effect\n\nthat  the  Celtics' stock  offering was  a  success and  that the\n\nPatriots  stock offering  could  be patterned  after the  Celtics\n\noffering.\n\n          As  for  the source  of  Brake's  specific $70  million\n\nfigure for  the  likely  proceeds  from a  sale  of  49%  of  the\n\nPatriots,  Brake  explained  a two-step  public  offering process\n\nwhich,  after  subtracting  underwriting fees,  would  yield  the\n\nSullivan's  $70 million.    Brake arrived  at  this figure  after\n\nstarting  with a  base value  of $150  million for  the Patriots.\n\nGiven the $80 million private sale price of the Patriots obtained\n\nby  Sullivan  when  he actually  sold  the  team,  and given  the\n\ntestimony  by Brake  and others  that public  stock of  NFL teams\n\nwould sell at a premium, we cannot say that the opinion by Brake,\n\nan investment banking expert,  was unreasonable or \"not supported\n\nby  sufficient facts  to validate  it in  the eyes  of the  law.\"\n\nBrooke </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112893\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Group,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112893/brooke-group-ltd-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">2589</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n            \n\n          Brake's  testimony was not  merely conclusory.  Rather,\n\nit was  embellished by various  explanations and  justifications.\n\nHis  testimony was  also not  overwhelmingly contradicted  by the\n\nweight of  the evidence or inherently contradictory, unreasonable\n\nor irrational.   Brake did overlook  some important factors  that\n\ncontradicted  his  opinion, but  he  was  questioned about  these\n\nfactors on cross-examination and  the NFL argued them before  the\n\njury.  The factors do not invalidate Brake's  opinion as a matter\n\nof law; rather, they  merely go to the weight  and credibility of\n\n                               -32-\n\nhis  opinions which are  matters for the  jury to consider.   The\n\nbasis of the opinion regarding the success of the Patriots public\n\noffering may be flimsy,  but it is not nonexistent  or irrational\n\nas a matter of law.\n\n          Although we  share the NFL's  skepticism that  Sullivan\n\nwould  have succeeded  in  his public  offering  if the  NFL  had\n\nallowed him to  try it, we cannot say  that, as a matter  of law,\n\nthe  evidence was so  overwhelming that no  reasonable jury could\n\nfind that the NFL's policy harmed Sullivan by preventing him from\n\ndoing  something he  would otherwise  have been  able to do.   We\n\ntherefore  reject  the  NFL's claim  that  it  is  entitled to  a\n\njudgment in its favor on the basis that Sullivan failed to  prove\n\nhis injury was caused by the alleged antitrust violation.\n\n                D.  Assignment of Antitrust Claim\n\n          The NFL argues that  Sullivan cannot bring this lawsuit\n\nbecause  he sold his antitrust  claim when he  sold the Patriots.\n\nThe  sale  contract  between  Sullivan and  KMS  Patriots,  L.P.,\n\nprovided  that  Sullivan transferred  to  the  buyers \"all  other\n\nassets\" of the Patriots' and its holding company,5 besides  those\n\nspecifically listed and those specifically excluded.  None of the\n\nlisted or excluded assets include an antitrust claim.   According\n\nto the NFL,  the term  \"all other assets\"  should be  interpreted\n\n                    \n\n5  The language of the contract actually states \"all other assets\nof  Selling Group,\"  which includes  Sullivan himself.   However,\nneither party asserts that Sullivan  intended to transfer all his\npersonal  assets  with this  clause and,  anyway, the  \"all other\nassets\" clause is number seventeen on a list of items referred to\nby the contract as  \"the following assets of the  Club and Holdco\n[the Patriots' holding company].\" \n\n                               -33-\n\nbroadly to include  the present  antitrust cause of  action.

As no such express language  appears in\n\nthe  contract  for the  sale of  the  Patriots, Sullivan  did not\n\ntransfer his interest in the present lawsuit to KMS Patriots when\n\nhe sold the team.\n\n          The NFL's  arguments concerning the application  of   1\n\nof the  Sherman Act to the facts of this case raise a substantial\n\nchallenge to the jury verdict and are certainly weighty enough to\n\ngive  us  pause.

In particular,  the NFL\n\nasserts that the district  court failed to provide the  jury with\n\nseveral crucial jury instructions that were required  in order to\n\npresent to  the jury certain legal theories that were potentially\n\ndispositive  of the  verdict.   The NFL  argues that  the court's\n\nfailure to give the  instructions was prejudicial error requiring\n\na new trial.\n\n          Determining whether the failure to  give proffered jury\n\ninstructions  is  error  depends  on  whether   the  instructions\n\nactually  given  to  the  jury,  taken  as  a  whole,  adequately\n\nexplained  the law or whether  they tended to  confuse or mislead\n\nthe jury  on  the controlling  issues  of  the case.

Equal Involvement Defense\n\n          The NFL argued before  the district court that Sullivan\n\nwas a complete and  substantially equal participant in  the NFL's\n\nownership  policy which he now challenges in the present lawsuit.\n\nAs a result of Sullivan's  involvement, the NFL claimed, Sullivan\n\nwas  barred from  bringing a damages  action under  the antitrust\n\nlaws pursuant to  the \"equal involvement defense\"  doctrine.  The\n\ndistrict court denied motions for summary judgment and a directed\n\nverdict  on this issue and, further, refused to instruct the jury\n\non  the availability  of the  defense because  it found  that the\n\n                    \n\n6   The court's failure  to instruct on  the complete involvement\ndefense was prejudicial error  and, by itself, sufficient grounds\nfor reversal  and a new trial.   We do not decide  whether any of\nthe other errors, standing  alone, are prejudicial.  We  do hold,\nhowever, that all the errors taken together are prejudicial.\n\n                               -36-\n\nevidence  showed   that  Sullivan  \"had  very   little,  if  any,\n\ninvolvement in  the formulation of [the  public ownership] rule,\"\n\nand  because the rule \"was imposed on [Sullivan] by a preexisting\n\nNational   Football  League  rule.\"     This  ruling  constituted\n\nprejudicial error  because the \"equal involvement  defense\" is an\n\nabsolute defense to an  antitrust claim and because the  evidence\n\nwarranted sending the issue to the jury.\n\n          A plaintiff's \"complete,  voluntary, and  substantially\n\nequal participation\"  in an illegal practice  under the antitrust\n\nlaws precludes recovery for that antitrust violation.

That Committee agreed,\n\nin  a merger  agreement signed  by Sullivan,  to adopt  the NFL's\n\npolicy against public ownership for the new NFL.  Sullivan's son,\n\nChuck,  stated that Sullivan was the central figure in the merger\n\nnegotiations.   Sullivan subsequently relied on  the NFL's public\n\nownership policy to justify  his purchase, through the merger  of\n\nhis team into a wholly owned company, of the outstanding stock of\n\nthe   Patriots  in  1976.    In  the  proxy  statement  for  that\n\ntransaction, Sullivan  listed  the NFL's  policy  against  public\n\nownership as one of the \"Reasons for the Merger\", and he attached\n\na  letter from the NFL justifying the public ownership policy and\n\nexplaining  that the  continued presence  of  public stockholders\n\nconflicted  with  the interests  of  the league.    Sullivan also\n\naffirmatively supported the policy  in sworn testimony during the\n\nlitigation with his  former shareholders  following the  Patriots\n\nmerger.  Sullivan stated that the  NFL's public ownership policy,\n\nand the  justifications underlying  the policy, were  the reasons\n\n                               -39-\n\nfor  his desire to purchase  all outstanding shares  of the team.\n\nThere  is no evidence that  Sullivan ever opposed  or objected to\n\ntheownership policypriorto thecircumstances surroundingthis case.\n\n          Taken  together,  this  evidence  is  sufficient for  a\n\nreasonable  jury to  conclude  that Sullivan  bears substantially\n\nequal  responsibility  for  the  NFL's  public  ownership  policy\n\nbecause  Sullivan helped adopt the policy, he relied upon it, and\n\nhe actively supported it.  The  jury, however, was never given an\n\nopportunity  to consider  this  evidence in  light  of the  equal\n\ninvolvement defense.\n\n          Sullivan  claims that  he was  not at  the meetings  in\n\nwhich  Lamar Hunt, the chairman  of the AFL  committee, agreed to\n\nthe NFL's public ownership  policy, and that he  did not know  in\n\nadvance that the old NFL's public ownership rule would be adopted\n\nby the  new NFL.   Mr. Hunt himself  testified, however, that  he\n\nalways spoke for the entire AFL committee at his various meetings\n\nwith NFL owners, and that he discussed various negotiating points\n\nwith  the  other  AFL  owners,  including  Sullivan,  before  any\n\ndecisions were made.   Moreover, Sullivan's  own team obtained  a\n\nspecific waiver  from the  ownership policy, which,  a reasonably\n\njury could  infer, indicates that  Sullivan was  involved in  the\n\ndecision to adopt  the policy.   In any event,  it is the  jury's\n\nresponsibility  to  weigh  the  evidence  and  make a  choice  in\n\ncircumstances  like this  where  the same  evidence supports  two\n\ndifferent yet reasonable conclusions.\n\n          The  district court erred  by failing to  give the jury\n\n                               -40-\n\nthe opportunity to  choose between these  versions of the  facts.\n\nThe court's  \"finding\" that Sullivan's involvement  in the public\n\nownership policy was minimal ignores evidence in the record.  The\n\ncourt's view that the NFL imposed the ownership policy on the AFL\n\nowners, rendering  their  participation involuntary,  is  largely\n\nunsupported  by  the  record.   Ultimately,  however,  these  are\n\nfactual  questions  for the  jury  and none  of  the instructions\n\nprovided  by the district court served to adequately instruct the\n\njury on this issue or send the issue to the jury.  Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court  erred in  refusing  to give  the NFL's  proffered\n\ninstruction on the \"equal involvement\" defense.\n\n          The error was prejudicial.  By refusing to instruct the\n\njury  on  the  equal  involvement  defense,  the  district  court\n\ndeprived the NFL of a  complete defense from Sullivan's  lawsuit.\n\nThe NFL presented facts that could have led to a dismissal of the\n\ncase if they were believed by  a properly instructed jury.  While\n\nthe NFL could have  highlighted, and in fact did  highlight, some\n\nof the facts concerning Sullivan's support of, and reliance upon,\n\nthe  ownership policy  in its closing  argument before  the jury,\n\nthis effort was limited to the argument that the NFL's policy was\n\n\"reasonable\"  for purposes of the  rule of reason  analysis.  The\n\nNFL did not, and could not, argue to the jury that it should rule\n\nin favor  of  the NFL  because  Sullivan's participation  in  the\n\nadoption  and  maintenance of  the  public  ownership policy  was\n\ncomplete,  voluntary  and  substantially  equal.     Without  the\n\nproffered  instruction,  the jury  had  no  occasion to  consider\n\n                               -41-\n\nwhether Sullivan  should be deprived of a  damages remedy because\n\nof his involvement in the policy he now challenges.  As a result,\n\nthe  district  court's  refusal  to send  the  equal  involvement\n\ndefense to the jury was prejudicial error requiring a new trial.\n\n      B.  Failure to Request an Official Vote of the Owners\n\n          As  discussed  in  Section  II.C. above,  in  order  to\n\nestablish  that the  policy  actually caused  injury to  himself,\n\nSullivan must prove  that the NFL effectively denied  his request\n\nto waive or  amend its  policy against public  ownership.   While\n\nthere is evidence that  supports a finding that the  NFL's policy\n\neffectively  blocked Sullivan from  pursuing his public offering,\n\nthere is also sufficient evidence to support a  contrary finding.\n\nSullivan's failure to  request a  vote from the  owners after  he\n\ndiscovered that he was four votes shy of  obtaining a waiver with\n\nseven owners  still undecided, combined with  former Commissioner\n\nRozelle's testimony that he told Sullivan  that Rozelle would put\n\nto  the owners  any plan  that Sullivan  wished, could  support a\n\nfinding  that Sullivan  was  a \"dormant  plaintiff\"  who did  not\n\n\"spring  into action\"  until it  was \"time  to file  suit.\"   Out\n                                                                 \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444378\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Front,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/444378/out-front-productions-inc-v-larry-magid-joseph-spivak-herbert-spivak/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  As such, a jury could conclude  that the\n     \n\nNFL  did not prevent Sullivan  from pursuing his  stock sale, but\n\ninstead, Sullivan  simply dropped the idea  for reasons unrelated\n\nto the  NFL's policy.  If the jury had reached such a conclusion,\n\nSullivan would have failed to prove that his injury was caused by\n\nthe antitrust policy, and judgment for the NFL would be required.\n\n          The  NFL  proposed  instructions concerning  Sullivan's\n\n                               -42-\n\nfailure to ask for a vote essentially stating that such a failure\n\nwould result  in judgment  for the  NFL if  it was reasonable  to\n\nrequire  Sullivan to make  such a request.   The court refused to\n\ngive the  instruction because it felt  that to do so  would be to\n\ncomment on the evidence, and the court did not want to comment on\n\nany  of the  evidence  presented at  trial.   We  understand  the\n\ncourt's concern but believe  that, under the facts of  this case,\n\nthere   is  a  crucial  point  of  law  contained  in  the  NFL's\n\ninstruction that was not otherwise provided to the jury.\n\n          The  jury  was instructed  generally  on  the issue  of\n\ncausation, but it was  not told that it had to  determine whether\n\nthe NFL's  policy against public ownership  was actually enforced\n\nagainst  Sullivan;  that  is,  whether the  policy,  the  alleged\n\nantitrust restraint, actually restrained Sullivan in any way from\n\nmaking a  49% public  offering of  his  team.   Although the  NFL\n\ncould, and did,  argue that Sullivan's failure to ask  for a vote\n\nwas  evidence that the policy  did not cause  injury to Sullivan,\n\nthere was no legal hook upon  which the jury could hang the NFL's\n\nargument.   The  failure  of  Sullivan to  request  a  vote is  a\n\ncritical  and potentially dispositive issue in this case.  If the\n\nalleged restraint of trade  does not even exist in  practice, the\n\nwhole case  essentially disappears.   Therefore, the  jury should\n\nhave been directed  to make a specific finding  as to whether the\n\npublic ownership policy was enforced against Sullivan.\n\n          If the jury is instructed that Sullivan must prove that\n\nthe NFL's policy  was enforced  against him, the  jury will  have\n\n                               -43-\n\ncause  to consider the crucial matter of whether the NFL actually\n\nenforced its policy  against Sullivan or rather,  whether the NFL\n\nnever had the chance  to enforce its policy because  Sullivan was\n\nnever  prepared to pursue his  public offering.  The instructions\n\nas  proffered  by the  NFL  may  need  to  be tailored  to  avoid\n\ncommenting on  the evidence surrounding the \"missing\" vote by the\n\nNFL  owners, but  that does not  excuse the court  from giving no\n\ninstruction  at all  on  the issue.   The  failure  to give  some\n\ninstruction concerning the failure of  Sullivan to request a vote\n\nwas error.        \n\n                      C.  The Murray Option\n\n          In 1986, prior to Sullivan's decision to  sell Patriots\n\nstock  to the public, Sullivan sold Fran  Murray an option to buy\n\nthe entire  club.   The  NFL took  the position  that the  Murray\n\noption  would have  been an  absolute bar to  any public  sale of\n\nPatriots  stock  and  that  Sullivan therefore  could  not  prove\n\ncausation.    The  NFL's   position  was  supported  by  evidence\n\nintroduced at trial.  Sullivan proffered evidence that the option\n\nwas not  a bar to sale because the option could be bought out and\n\nbecause it  could not be legally enforced.   The issue of whether\n\nMurray  could have, or would  have, blocked a  public offering by\n\nthe Patriots was ultimately disputed.\n\n          The option agreement and Murray's  deposition testimony\n\nwere  received  into  evidence.   The  district  court,  however,\n\nrefused to admit  Murray's statement  that he  would indeed  have\n\nstopped  any public stock sale of the Patriots from going forward\n\n                               -44-\n\nif  he had been told about it.   The court found the testimony to\n\nbe  too speculative to be admissible.  While the court's decision\n\nto exclude  Murray's \"speculative\"  testimony is well  within the\n\ncourt's wide  latitude of  discretion in making  such evidentiary\n\nrulings, United States  v. Abel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111285\"><a href=\"/opinion/111285/united-states-v-abel/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54  (1984); Doty v.\n                                                              \n\nSewall,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545153\"><a href=\"/opinion/545153/arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall-arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1058  (1st  Cir.  1990),  we note  that\n      \n\nSullivan's  entire case as to the causation of injury was equally\n\nspeculative.   Whether Sullivan's proposed stock  sale could have\n\nproceeded  and would have been  successful in the  absence of the\n\nNFL's  public  ownership  policy  was a  matter  of  considerable\n\nconjecture.  Fairness would seem to militate towards allowing the\n\nNFL to present  its own version of the  probable course of future\n\nevents to counter Sullivans' theorizing.\n\n          In any  event, the  court's subsequent refusal  to give\n\nthe  NFL's proffered  jury  instruction on  the  law of  options,\n\nspecifically    the   legal   consequences   of   options   under\n\nMassachusetts law, erroneously removed another crucial issue from\n\nthe jury's purview.  The Murray  option was a key defense for the\n\nNFL,  because if  Sullivan did  not have  a legal  right to  sell\n\nPatriots stock to the public, he did not suffer any harm from the\n\nNFL's  ownership policy and the  NFL would have  been entitled to\n\njudgment in its favor.   Again, the NFL could make  this argument\n\nto  the jury, but the  jury would still  lack crucial information\n\nconcerning the legal underpinnings  of a crucial defense for  the\n\nNFL.\n\n          Sullivan argues  that  the NFL's  proposed  instruction\n\n                               -45-\n\nwould have singled out one factual issue related to causation for\n\nthe jury's special attention,  something that would have unfairly\n\nprejudiced Sullivan.  Sullivan adds that allowing the instruction\n\nwould  have  generated  countering  instructions  on other  legal\n\nfacets of option law that were relevant to Sullivan's position on\n\nthe  option issue  and ultimately  would have confused  the jury.\n\nThese  arguments  notwithstanding,  we  feel  that,  as  long  as\n\nsuitable  instructions  are  provided covering  the  basic  legal\n\npoints  relevant to each party's arguments, the jury would not be\n\nunduly  confused.   Furthermore, the risk  of prejudice  from the\n\ninstruction -- due  to the  added attention afforded  one of  the\n\nNFL's  defenses  --  is  not sufficient  to  justify  effectively\n\ndepriving  the NFL of a crucial defense.   Ultimately, it was for\n\nthe jury  to  decide whether  the  Murray option  constituted  an\n\ninsurmountable obstacle to Sullivan's  case on causation, and the\n\ndistrict  court's  refusal  to instruct  on  the  law of  options\n\nvirtually removed this issue from consideration by the jury.\n\n     D.  Balancing Procompetitive and Anticompetitive Effects\n                      in the Relevant Market\n\n          As we noted above, the rule of reason analysis requires\n\na  weighing  of  the  injury  and  the  benefits  to  competition\n\nattributable to a practice  that allegedly violates the antitrust\n\nlaws.

The  district court\n                        \n\ninstructed the  jury on its verdict form to balance the injury to\n\ncompetition  in   the  relevant  market  with   the  benefits  to\n\ncompetition in  that same relevant  market.   The NFL  protested,\n\nclaiming  that all  procompetitive  effects of  its policy,  even\n\n                               -46-\n\nthose  in a  market  different from  that  in which  the  alleged\n\nrestraint operated,  should be  considered.   The NFL's  case was\n\npremised on  the claim that  its policy against  public ownership\n\nwas  an important part of the effective functioning of the league\n\nas a  joint venture.  Although  it was not readily  apparent that\n\nthis  beneficial  effect  applied  to the  market  for  ownership\n\ninterests  in NFL teams, the  relevant market found  by the jury,\n\nthe  NFL  argued that  its  justification  should necessarily  be\n\nweighed by the jury under the rule of reason analysis.   Sullivan\n\nresponded, and the district  court agreed, that a jury  cannot be\n\nasked to  compare what  are essentially  apples and  oranges, and\n\nthat  it  is  impossible  to  conduct  a  balancing   of  alleged\n\nanticompetitive   and  procompetitive  effects  of  a  challenged\n\npractice in every definable market.\n\n          The issue of  defining the  proper scope of  a rule  of\n\nreason  analysis  is  a   deceptive  body  of  water,  containing\n\nunforeseen currents  and turbulence lying just  below the surface\n\nof an  otherwise calm and peaceful ocean.

Therefore, it is impossible to tell whether the\nCourt  was consciously applying the  rule of reason  to include a\nbroad area of procompetitive benefits in a variety of markets, or\nwhether  the  Court  was  simply  not  being  very  careful   and\ninadvertently extended  the rule of reason past its proper scope.\nThere is certainly no  language, as Sullivan suggests, indicating\nthat   the  Court   was  considering   the  alleged   benefit  of\n\"competitive   balance\"  only   to   the  extent   that  it   had\nprocompetitive  effects  in  the  market  for  televised football\ngames.\n\n                               -48-\n\nSupp. 1336, 1358  (N.D.Ill. 1991).

Arguably, the market\n\nput forward by the NFL -- that is the market for NFL  football in\n\ncompetition  with  other forms  of  entertainment  -- is  closely\n\nrelated to the  relevant market found  by the jury such  that the\n\nprocompetitive   benefits  in   one  can   be  compared   to  the\n\nanticompetitive harms  in the other.   Clearly this  question can\n\nonly be answered  upon a much more in-depth  inquiry that we need\n\nnot, nor find it appropriate to, embark upon at this time.   \n\n          Finally,  we  note  that although  balancing  harms and\n\nbenefits in different markets may be unwieldy and confusing, such\n\nis the case with a number of balancing tests that a court or jury\n\nis expected to  apply all  the time.   Indeed, Justice  Brandeis'\n\nfamous formulation of the rule of reason seems to contemplate the\n\nbalancing of  a wide variety of factors  and considerations, many\n\nof which are not necessarily comparable or correlative:\n\n            The true  test of legality is whether the\n            restraint  imposed  is  such   as  merely\n            regulates  and  perhaps thereby  promotes\n            competition or whether it is such as  may\n            suppress or even destroy competition.  To\n            determine  that  question the  court must\n            ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to\n            the  business to  which the  restraint is\n            applied; its condition  before and  after\n            the restraint was  imposed; the nature of\n            the  restraint and its  effect, actual or\n            probable.

The NFL  wanted the  jury to\n\nconsider its  proffered justifications  for the  public ownership\n\npolicy  -- namely that the  policy enhanced the  NFL's ability to\n\neffectively produce and  present a popular entertainment  product\n\nunimpaired by  the  conflicting interests  that public  ownership\n\nwould  cause.   These  procompetitive justifications  should have\n\nbeen  considered by the jury, even under Sullivan's theory of the\n\nproper scope of the rule  of reason analysis.  As we point out in\n\nnote [4] above, and as Sullivan himself points out, to the extent\n\nthe NFL's  policy strengthens and improves  the league, resulting\n\n                               -51-\n\nin increased competition in the market for ownership interests in\n\nNFL clubs through, for example, more valuable teams, the jury may\n\nconsider the NFL's justifications as relevant factors in its rule\n\nof  reason analysis.  The danger of the proffered instructions on\n\nthe verdict  form is  that they  may have  mislead the  jury into\n\nthinking  that  it  was  precluded  from  considering  the  NFL's\n\njustifications for its ownership policy.  Therefore, the relevant\n\nmarket  language on the verdict  form should be  removed, or else\n\nthe  jury  should  be  informed  that  evidence  of  benefits  to\n\ncompetition  in  the  relevant  market can  include  evidence  of\n\nbenefits flowing indirectly from the public ownership policy that\n\nultimately  have  a  beneficial  impact  on  competition  in  the\n\nrelevant market itself.\n\n     E.

Evidence about prior  antitrust violations by the defendant\n\nmay, in  appropriate cases,  be  admissible to  show things  like\n\nmarket  power,  intent  to   monopolize,  motive,  or  method  of\n\nconspiracy.

In many of\n               \n\nthe  instances where Sullivan  or his counsel  made references to\n\nprior antitrust cases  at trial, Sullivan failed  to satisfy this\n\nburden.\n\n          Sullivan argues  that  the prior  cases  were  relevant\n\neither to  certain testimony regarding the  reasonableness of the\n\nNFL's ownership policy and voting requirements or to the issue of\n\ndefining  the  relevant  market.    Because  none  of  the  cases\n\nmentioned at  trial concerned the NFL's ownership policy at issue\n\nhere,  evidence of  those  prior cases  is  not relevant  to  the\n\nreasonableness of the NFL's policy against public ownership.  The\n\ngeneral voting requirements are not in dispute, so cases touching\n\nsolely upon them are also not relevant.  Certain limited portions\n\nof  some prior antitrust decisions  are relevant to  the issue of\n\ndefining the  relevant market.   The testimony and  commentary at\n\ntrial  concerning these prior cases,  however, was not limited to\n\nthe relevant market portions of these cases and, on the contrary,\n\nfocussed  primarily on  the  issue of  whether  the NFL's  public\n\nownership policy was  unreasonable.  As  such, that evidence  was\n\nprejudicial,  without  any  balancing  relevance  to  justify its\n\n                               -53-\n\nadmission into evidence.\n\n          The references to prior NFL cases were made in a number\n\nof different  contexts during the trial  (including during direct\n\nexamination,  cross-examination,  and at  closing  argument), and\n\nthey  contained  a  variety  of  different  information.    These\n\nreferences  are not likely to  be repeated in  precisely the same\n\ncontext  upon  a new  trial.   Therefore, instead  of identifying\n\nwhich particular  pieces of evidence were  inadmissible, we think\n\nit  would be  more  useful  to  point  out  more  generally  that\n\nreferences to prior  NFL cases are not  relevant to the  issue of\n\nthe reasonableness of the NFL's  public ownership policy and such\n\nreferences should  be excluded if they  contain information about\n\nthe unreasonableness of other  policies of the NFL which  were at\n\nissue in the other cases.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n                               \n\n                               -54-\n</pre>",
