This  appeal  by\r                      BOWNES,  Senior  Circuit  Judge.\r                                                     \r\n\ndefendant-appellant  John Carl DelBonis,  a chapter 7 debtor,\r\n\nconcerns the  dischargeability of educational  loans under 11\r\n\nU.S.C.   523 (a)(8).  The District Court for the  District of\r\n\nMassachusetts  reversed  a  bankruptcy  court  order granting\r\n\nDelBonis  summary  judgment.     Debtor's  appeal  from  that\r\n\ndecision  asks  us to  do  two things:  reverse  the district\r\n\ncourt's  holding  that federal  credit  unions  are nonprofit\r\n\norganizations and  hold that educational loans  issued to him\r\n\nby creditor-appellee TI Federal Credit Union are,  therefore,\r\n\ndischargeable in bankruptcy.  We deny both requests.  \r\n\n          Instead,  we affirm  the  result  achieved  by  the\r\n\ndistrict court -- that debtor's loans are nondischargeable --\r\n\nand  elect not to reach  the issue of  federal credit unions'\r\n\nnonprofit status.  Because our conclusion that federal credit\r\n\nunions  qualify as government units  within the meaning of 11\r\n\nU.S.C.    523(a)(8)  provides  a sufficient  legal basis  for\r\n\nupholding the district court's order, we reserve the issue of\r\n\nwhether such organizations qualify as nonprofit organizations\r\n\nwithin  the   meaning  of  that  statute   for  another  day.\r\n\nJurisdiction of this appeal stems from 28 U.S.C.   158(d).\r\n\n        I.     THE FACTS\r                    I.     THE FACTS\r\n\n          Financial  difficulties caused  defendant-appellant\r\n\nJohn Carl DelBonis (\"DelBonis\")  to file for bankruptcy under\r\n\nChapter  7  of the  Bankruptcy  Code on  September  20, 1993.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nDelBonis's  Chapter  7 application,  which  he  filed in  the\r\n\nEastern  District  of  Massachusetts,  listed,   inter  alia,\r                                                                        \r\n\neducational  loans he  obtained  on behalf  of  his wife  and\r\n\nchildren  as debts to be  discharged.  The  loans, from which\r\n\nDelBonis obtained no direct personal  benefit and on which he\r\n\nis the sole obligor, were acquired from the  Texas Instrument\r\n\nFederal Credit  Union, (\"TIFCU\") while DelBonis  was employed\r\n\nat Texas Instruments, Inc.   DelBonis's employment with Texas\r\n\nInstruments,  Inc.,  one  of  nine  institutional members  of\r\n\nTIFCU, terminated in November, 1992.\r\n\n          Chartered on  May 9, 1960, pursuant  to the Federal\r\n\nCredit  Union Act,  12  U.S.C.    1751  et seq.,  TIFCU is  a\r                                                          \r\n\nfederal credit union and has its principal place of  business\r\n\nin  Attleboro,  Massachusetts.    Like  most  federal  credit\r\n\nunions,  TIFCU provides  a  variety of  credit, savings,  and\r\n\nfinancial  counseling  services to  its  members.   Loans  --\r\n\neducational; home equity; residential real estate; and member\r\n\nbusiness  -- however,  represent TIFCU's  primary investment.\r\n\nCf.   National   Credit  Union   Administration,   Office  of\r              \r\n\nExamination and  Insurance, Federal Credit Union  Handbook 11\r                                                                      \r\n\n(1988).   Because TIFCU is  a federal credit  union, its loan\r\n\nactivities are heavily regulated by the National Credit Union\r\n\nAdministration (\"NCUA\").  See generally 12 C.F.R. Ch. VII (1-\r                                                   \r\n\n1-95 Edition).   NCUA exists  within the executive  branch of\r\n\nthe  federal  government  and  was  established  in  1970  to\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n\"prescrib[e] rules and  regulations for the organization  and\r\n\noperation of federal credit unions  . . . .\"   Federal Credit\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnion Handbook, supra, at 2.\r                                 \r\n\n          DelBonis  took  out his  first  educational expense\r\n\nloan  with TIFCU  on  December  27,  1985,  for  the  sum  of\r\n\n$3,500.00.  TIFCU  advanced the  loans as part  of a  special\r\n\neducational  loan  program.    The  program,  which  was  not\r\n\nfederally guaranteed, had  several attractive  features.   It\r\n\nmade  loans  at low  interest  rates,  gave borrowers  longer\r\n\nrepayment  periods, and  allowed  loans to  be aggregated  in\r\n\nmaximum amounts greater  than those permitted  under personal\r\n\nloan programs.  \r\n\n          One  of  the  most appealing  features  of  TIFCU's\r\n\neducational  loan program  was that  it enabled  borrowers to\r\n\nsimultaneously   borrow   additional   funds  and   refinance\r\n\noutstanding  balances  on  previous  loans.    DelBonis  took\r\n\nadvantage of this feature on  numerous occasions.  Under  the\r\n\nrequirements  of the  loan  program, the  proceeds from  each\r\n\ntransaction were paid directly to the educational institution\r\n\nDelBonis specified. \r\n\n          During  the period  spanning December  27, 1985  to\r\n\nJanuary 4,  1991, DelBonis turned to TIFCU  sixteen times for\r\n\nassistance in  meeting his family's educational  needs.  Each\r\n\ntime TIFCU responded by granting him the funds  he requested.\r\n\nIn  fact,  TIFCU advanced  a  total  of  $43,114.87  in  loan\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nproceeds on DelBonis's behalf.  DelBonis ultimately asked and\r\n\nwas  permitted  to  consolidate  these loans  into  a  single\r\n\npromissory note for $39,064.46,  payable over ten years, with\r\n\ninterest  at  9.6%  per  annum.    A  principal  balance   of\r\n\n$32,618.27 is currently due on that amount.\r\n\n  II.     THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r              II.     THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r\n\n          On  December 3,  1993, nine  months after  DelBonis\r\n\nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and, thereby,  sought to avoid\r\n\nrepayment  of his  loan  debt, TIFCU  initiated a  bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt adversary proceeding.  TIFCU requested a  determination\r\n\nas  to whether 11 U.S.C.   523(a)(8) rendered the educational\r\n\nloans  issued  to  DelBonis nondischargeable  in  bankruptcy.\r\n\nTIFCU  argued that  its  status  as  a nonprofit  required  a\r\n\nfinding of nondischargeability under the statute.\r\n\n          Six months  after the adversary  proceedings began,\r\n\nthe  parties submitted  an Agreed  Statement of  Fact  to the\r\n\nbankruptcy  court.    That  document  included  the erroneous\r\n\nstipulation that \"TIFCU  is not a governmental unit  . . . .\"\r\n\nAgreed  Statement of Fact at 2.   DelBonis filed a motion for\r                                     \r\n\nsummary judgment  on June  6, 1994, almost  immediately after\r\n\nthe Agreed  Statement of Fact  was filed with  the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt.  His summary judgment motion raised two issues bearing\r\n\non  11 U.S.C.   523  (a)(8)'s applicability in  this case: 1)\r\n\nwhether  TIFCU is  a  nonprofit institution;  and 2)  whether\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ndebtor's  loans  became  due  within  the  seven-year  period\r\n\nprescribed by 11 U.S.C.   523(a)(8).  \r\n\n          The  bankruptcy court  granted summary  judgment on\r\n\nthe first issue and, based on its analysis, did not reach the\r\n\nsecond  issue.    The  bankruptcy  court  found  that  \"loans\r\n\nincurred  to educate members of a  debtor's family qualify as\r\n\neducational  loans   within  the  meaning  of   11  U.S.C.   \r\n\n523(a)(8).\"   In re DelBonis, 169 B.R.  1, 2 (Bankr. D. Mass.\r                                        \r\n\n1994).  It ruled, however, that federal credit unions are not\r\n\nnonprofit   organizations   entitled  to   Section  523(a)(8)\r\n\nprotection because they are comprised  of member-shareholders\r\n\nand are authorized to  issue dividends to such members.   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nThe bankruptcy  court found  that nonprofit  organizations do\r\n\nnot  possess  such  characteristics.     Id.  at  3-4.    The\r                                                        \r\n\nbankruptcy  court  acknowledged that  TIFCU's  suit  raised a\r\n\nnovel issue  of law and, therefore,  denied debtor's requests\r\n\nfor fees and costs.  Id. at 4.  \r                                    \r\n\n          TIFCU appealed  the bankruptcy court's  decision on\r\n\nJune  28, 1994  and  filed  a  Motion  to  Amend  the  Agreed\r\n\nStatement  of  Fact   on  the  ground  that  it   included  a\r\n\nstipulation  erroneously denying  TIFCU's legal  status as  a\r\n\ngovernment unit.  The  bankruptcy court denied TIFCU's Motion\r\n\nto Amend  on July 11,  1994.  TIFCU subsequently  filed a new\r\n\nNotice  of Appeal  challenging  both the  bankruptcy  court's\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nsummary  judgment order and denial of the Motion to Amend the\r\n\nAgreed Statement of Fact.\r\n\n          On   appeal,  the   district  court   reversed  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's  grant of summary judgment.   It held that\r\n\nfederal  credit  unions  qualify  as  nonprofit organizations\r\n\nunder  Section  523(a)(8)  and   issued  a  detailed  opinion\r\n\noutlining the legal and  policy-based justifications for such\r\n\na  classification.   Id. at  5.   Our decision  in  La Caisse\r                                                                         \r\n\nPopulaire Ste. Marie v. United States, 563 F.2d 505 (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1977),  defining   a  credit  union   as  \"a   democratically\r\n\ncontrolled, cooperative, nonprofit society organized  for the\r\n\npurpose  of encouraging  thrift and  self-reliance  among its\r\n\nmembers .  . .  ,\"  was cited  as  support for  the  district\r\n\ncourt's reversal.   Id. at  4-5 (quoting La  Caisse Populaire\r                                                                         \r\n\nSte.  Marie v.  United States,  563 F.2d  505, 509  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1977).   La Caisse held that state credit unions are entitled\r                              \r\n\nto general  income tax exemption  under Section 501(c)(14)(A)\r\n\nof the Internal Revenue Code.  Because the ground on which it\r\n\nbased  its decision  independently warranted  a  finding that\r\n\ndebtor's  loans  are  nondischargeable,  the  district  court\r\n\ndeemed  it unnecessary  to \"reach  the question  whether [the\r\n\nbankruptcy court judge]  should have allowed the  appellant's\r\n\nmotion to amend its agreed statement of facts regarding . . .\r\n\n[TIFCU's] status as a federal instrumentality.\"  Id. at 5.\r                                                                \r\n\nIII.      THE STATUTE\r            III.      THE STATUTE\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Resolution   of   this  case,   as   the  following\r\n\ndiscussion  reveals,  requires us  to  consider  a gaggle  of\r\n\nstatutes and statutory issues.  Questions about the status of\r\n\nfederal credit unions implicate the Federal Credit Union Act,\r\n\n12 U.S.C.    1751 et  seq., bankruptcy law,  and the  federal\r                                     \r\n\nincome  tax  code.    See  26  U.S.C.    501.    Because  the\r                                     \r\n\npossibilities for  confusion run high, we  think it important\r\n\nto clearly set out  the terms of 11  U.S.C.   523(a)(8),  the\r\n\nstatute on the basis  of which TIFCU initiated the  adversary\r\n\nproceeding.    In  relevant  part,  11 U.S.C.     523  (a)(8)\r\n\nprovides:\r\n\n          (a) A discharge  under section 727, 1141,\r\n          1228(a), 1228(b) or 1328(b) of this title\r\n          does not discharge  an individual  debtor\r\n          from any debt -- \r\n\n          (8)    for    an   educational    benefit\r\n          overpayment  or  loan  made,  insured  or\r\n          guaranteed by a government unit,  or made\r\n          under  any program funded  in whole or in\r\n          part by a  governmental unit or nonprofit\r\n          institution,  or  for  an  obligation  to\r\n          repay  funds  received as  an educational\r\n          benefit,scholarship or stipend, unless --\r\n          (A) such loan,  benefit, scholarship,  or\r\n          stipend overpayment first became due more\r\n          than 7 years (exclusive of any applicable\r\n          suspension   of  the   repayment  period)\r\n          before  the date  of  the filing  of  the\r\n          petition; or (B) excepting such debt from\r\n          discharge   under  this   paragraph  will\r\n          impose an un-due  hardship on the  debtor\r\n          and the debtor's dependents.\r\n\n          In   summary,   Section   523(a)(8)    offers   two\r\n\nalternatives for  adjudicating educational loans issued  by a\r\n\nfederal credit union  nondischargeable.   First, it  provides\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthat   educational  loans   or   benefit   overpayments   are\r\n\nnondischargeable,  if issued in whole or in part by an agency\r\n\nqualifying as a nonprofit  organization.  Second, the statute\r\n\nalso  makes   loans  issued,   insured,   or  guaranteed   by\r\n\ngovernmental units nondischargeable.  A debtor's loans, thus,\r\n\nare nondischargeable  if they  fall within the  parameters of\r\n\neither provision.  \r\n\n          Congress delineates  only  two exceptions  to  this\r\n\nnondischargeability  policy.     A  demonstration   that  the\r\n\neducational loan,  benefit, scholarship, or  stipend at issue\r\n\nin the case first became due more than seven years before the\r\n\nfiling of the  bankruptcy petition excepts a  debtor from the\r\n\nstatute.    Finally, evidence  that  nondischargeability will\r\n\nimpose  an undue  hardship on  debtor or  debtor's dependents\r\n\nprovides a basis for circumventing  nondischargeability.  The\r\n\nhardship alleged, however, must  be undue and attributable to\r\n\ntruly  exceptional  circumstances,  such  as  illness  or the\r\n\nexistence  of an unusually large number of dependents.  In re\r                                                                         \r\n\nLohman, 79 B.R. 576, 581 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1987).  \r                  \r\n\n          Thus far, this case has primarily traveled down the\r\n\nanalytical path  carved out by Section  523(a)(8)'s nonprofit\r\n\norganization   provision.     In  the   adversary  proceeding\r\n\nconducted  before  the  bankruptcy  court,  TIFCU's principal\r\n\nargument for nondischargeability of DelBonis's loans was that\r\n\nit qualified  as a nonprofit organization  within the meaning\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nof  11 U.S.C.   523  (a)(8).  Similarly,  both the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt and the district  court, albeit with different results,\r\n\nfocused  solely   on  whether  federal   credit  unions   are\r\n\nnonprofits.\r\n\n          A reasonable  basis for assuming such an analytical\r\n\ntack  exists, to be sure.   Numerous other  courts have fixed\r\n\ntheir nondischargeability analyses on questions pertaining to\r\n\nthe, oftentimes, fine distinctions between nonprofit and for-\r\n\nprofit entities.  Unfortunately, a reading of their decisions\r\n\nsuggests that no clear consensus on  these questions has been\r\n\nreached.    See In re Roberts, 149 B.R.  547 (Bankr.

Sound judicial  policy counsels\r\n\nagainst  deciding  complicated legal  issues  where a  clear,\r\n\nprincipled, alternative  basis for  reaching the same  result\r\n\nexists.   Cf.  Walmac Co. v.  Issacs, 220 F.2d  108, 113 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1955).  TIFCU's appeal  of the bankruptcy court's denial\r\n\nof its Motion to Amend the Agreed Statement of Fact  gave the\r\n\ndistrict court an  opportunity to decide  this case under  11\r\n\nU.S.C.     523  (a)(8)'s  government unit  provision.    That\r\n\nprovision  provides us  with a principled,  alternative basis\r\n\nfor affirming the district court's nondischargeability order.\r\n\n          Unlike the nonprofit provision, the government unit\r\n\nprong  of  the  Section  523(a)(8)  is  unambiguous  and  not\r\n\nparticularly difficult  to interpret.

We are convinced that a miscarriage of justice would\r\n\nbe  worked by a failure to address the governmental status of\r\n\nfederal credit  unions because the  governmental issues  that\r\n\nquestion  implicates  are   so  important.     The  continued\r\n\nviability of  educational loan programs and  the stability of\r\n\nfederal  credit  unions impact  the  health  of the  national\r\n\neconomy  and  the  country's   educational  system.    As  we\r\n\nindicated  in  the previous  section, whether  federal credit\r\n\nunions qualify as government units under Section 523(a)(8) is\r\n\n\"strictly a question of law\" and can be resolved on the basis\r\n\nof the  existing record.

The dischargeability  of loans under  Section 523(a)(8)\r               \r\n\ncontinues  to be a heavily  litigated area.

And \"[i]n the review of judicial proceedings . . .\r\n\n[it]  is settled that, if  the decision below  is correct, it\r\n\nmust  be affirmed,  although the  lower court  relied upon  a\r\n\nwrong  ground or gave a  wrong reason.\"   Helvering v.

In the more than sixty years since\r\n\nthe Federal Credit Union Act's passage, federal credit unions\r\n\nhave,  undeniably,  increased  in  number  and  significantly\r\n\nexpanded   the   services  they   provide.     Today,   these\r\n\ninstitutions  offer an  increasingly complicated  and complex\r\n\narray of financial services.  United States v. Michigan,  851\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d  at 805;  see generally  Federal Credit  Union Handbook,\r                                                                        \r\n\nsupra at 11-14. \r                 \r\n\n          We firmly reject,  however, debtor's argument  that\r\n\nthis fact militates against a finding in TIFCU's favor.  That\r\n\nfederal  credit unions  now have  the capacity to  compete on\r\n\nquasi-equal  footing with  other financial  institutions does\r\n\nnot alter  our conclusion  that they perform  a predominantly\r\n\ngovernmental purpose.   We echo the  district court's insight\r\n\nthat  \"the extent to which a federal credit union resembles a\r\n\nbank should  [not] be determinative  of the issue  before the\r\n\ncourt.\"   TI Federal Credit  Union, 183 B.R.  at 4.   We also\r                                              \r\n\nnote  that internal  characteristics, such as  limitations on\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nmembership  and location,  distinguish federal  credit unions\r\n\nfrom proprietary institutions such as banks.  Banks, with few\r\n\nexceptions, may  do business wherever and  with whomever they\r\n\nwish.   Federal credit unions, in contrast,  must limit their\r\n\nmemberships  and, therefore, business  operations, to \"groups\r\n\nhaving  a common  bond  of occupation  or association,  or to\r\n\ngroups  within a  well-defined  neighborhood,  community,  or\r\n\nrural district.\"  12 U.S.C.   1759. \r\n\n          Finally,  we,  like  our  colleagues  on the  Sixth\r\n\nCircuit, find  two additional features  federal credit unions\r\n\nshare   conclusive   --   tax   exemption   and  governmental\r\n\nregulation.   Congress,  in exempting  federal  credit unions\r\n\nfrom  federal income  taxation, has  expressed the  view that\r\n\nfederal  credit  unions  serve  several  unique  governmental\r\n\npurposes and  are, therefore, different from  banks.  Section\r\n\n501(c)(1)(A)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code   provides  an\r\n\nexemption  for  \"[a]ny  corporation  organized  under  Act of\r\n\nCongress which is an instrumentality of the United States . .\r\n\n. if such  corporation is  exempt from  Federal income  taxes\r\n\nunder  such Act as  amended and supplemented  before July 18,\r\n\n1984 . . .  .\"  26 U.S.C. section  501(c)(1)(A)(i).\"  Because\r\n\nthe  Federal  Credit  Union  Act expressly  provides  federal\r\n\ncredit unions  an exemption from  federal, as well  as state,\r\n\nterritorial, or  local taxation, federal  credit unions  fall\r\n\nwithin  the parameters of this provision.

The Internal Revenue  Code itself belies the\r\n\nvalue in drawing such  an inference, for it also  provides an\r\n\nexemption  for state credit  unions under Section  501.  Yet,\r\n\nsuch entities clearly are not federal instrumentalities.  \r\n\n          The  manner  in  which  Congress  exempted  federal\r\n\ncredit   unions  from  taxation   is,  however,  significant.\r\n\nCongress did not treat federal and state credit unions alike;\r\n\nit  addressed federal  and  state credit  unions in  entirely\r\n\ndifferent sections of the Internal  Revenue Code.

These aspects of  the tax exemption  federal credit\r\n\nunions  receive  support  our belief  that  Congress  regards\r\n\nfederal credit unions as federal instrumentalities. \r\n\n          The  imprimatur Congress  places on  federal credit\r\n\nunions by way  of tax  exemption is not  the only  additional\r\n\nfeature which convinces us  of federal credit unions' special\r\n\nstatus.        Extensive   government    regulation   further\r\n\ndistinguishes federal credit unions from ordinary proprietary\r\n\norganizations.

In  reaching our\r\n\ndecision    that    such     organizations    are     federal\r\n\ninstrumentalities,  we noted that  federal savings  and loans\r\n\nare federally  created banks,  chartered and regulated  by an\r\n\nexecutive  branch entity,  the Federal  Home Loan  Board, and\r\n\nthat \"they  serve the  statutory purpose of  providing 'local\r\n\nmutual thrift  institutions in which people  may invest their\r\n\nfunds  and .  . .  for the  financing of  homes, .  . .

But, few, if\r\n\nany,  inferences can  be drawn from  our recognition  of such\r\n\ndistinctions  because  United  States  v.

State credit\r\n\nunions  are altogether  different  entities;  unlike  federal\r\n\ncredit unions,  they are neither chartered  under the Federal\r\n\nCredit Union Act, nor regulated by the NCUA.  \r\n\n          It does not, of  course, follow that no differences\r\n\nbetween   federal   credit   unions   and   federal   savings\r\n\ninstitutions  exist.   The  United States  Supreme Court  has\r\n\nitself  held  that federal  credit  unions  and federal  loan\r\n\nassociations are  \"far from  identical.\"  First  Federal Sav.\r                                                                         \r\n\nand Loan  Ass'n of Boston v.

The basis  for its holding,  however, rested on\r\n\nthe assumption  that federal  credit unions are  more closely\r\n\ntied to  the government and  its functions than  federal loan\r\n\nassociations,  not  less.    As  the   Court  noted  when  it\r\n\nconsidered some  of the  same issues we  addressed in  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

The\r\n\nprinciples addressed  in that case are  not directly relevant\r\n\nhere.  Furthermore, we make no effort to liken federal credit\r\n\nunions  to government  agencies; we  are persuaded  only that\r\n\nthey are government instrumentalities, lesser in scope and in\r\n\nresponsibility than actual government agencies.   \r\n\nD.

We must  still resolve  whether treating\r\n\nfederal credit unions as federal instrumentalities and, thus,\r\n\nas government  units, is consistent  with the purposes  of 11\r\n\nU.S.C.  section  523(a)(8).

The\r\n          destruction  of   student  loan  programs\r\n          would represent a tremendous waste of one\r\n          of  this  nation's  greatest assets,  the\r\n          minds and skills of American youth. \r\n\nId.

L. No. 95-598, 92\r\n\nStat.  2549 (1978); see  also In re  Segal, 57 F.3d  342 (3rd\r                                                      \r\n\nCir.  1995).  This  version of  the subsection,  however, was\r\n\nshort-lived.      Congressional    efforts   to   limit   the\r\n\ndischargeability of educational loans by expanding the  types\r\n\nof   loans  or  institutions  covered  by  Section  523(a)(8)\r\n\ncontinued  after  1978.    Amendments made  in  1979  rewrote\r\n\nSection  523(a)(8)  to  include  \"educational  loan[s]  made,\r\n\ninsured, or guaranteed by a government unit or made under any\r\n\nprogram funded in whole or in part by a governmental  unit or\r\n\na nonprofit institution  of higher education\".

This extended the provisions\r\n\nof that section  to all nonprofit  loan programs, not  merely\r\n\nthose associated  with  an institution  of higher  education.\r\n\nWhen  read  together,  the  1979  and  1984  amendments  made\r\n\nnondischargeable loans issued pursuant to an educational loan\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\nprogram   operated   by  a   nonprofit   organization   or  a\r\n\ngovernmental  unit  and  educational  loans  acquired from  a\r\n\ncommercial financial institution, if such loans were  insured\r\n\nby a  governmental unit.

They\r\n\nexpanded nondischargeability to encompass  educational loans,\r\n\nas  well as educational  benefit overpayments and obligations\r\n\nto   repay  funds   received   as  an   educational  benefit,\r\n\nscholarship  or stipend.

The  1990 Amendment also  made it more\r\n\ndifficult for debtors to take  advantage of the exceptions to\r\n\nnondischargeability.   It  increased from  five to  seven the\r\n\nnumber of years which  must have elapsed between the  date an\r\n\nexception  seeking debtor's  loans first  became due  and the\r\n\nfiling of the bankruptcy petition.  Id. at section 3621(2).\r                                                   \r\n\n          Viewed against  the backdrop of the Bankruptcy Code\r\n\nas a whole, Section  523(a)(8) and the amendments made  to it\r\n\nare  aberrations  from  the   norm.    Congress  drafted  the\r\n\nBankruptcy  Code  to  effectuate  the   \"general  purpose  of\r\n\nproviding  debtors with  'a new  opportunity in  life with  a\r\n\nclear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and\r\n\ndiscouragement of pre-existing debt.'\"   In re Alibayata, 178\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\nB.R.  335,  337 (E.D.N.Y.  1995) (quoting  Local Loan  Co. v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHunt, 292  U.S. 234 (1934)).  The Code, thus, was intended to\r                \r\n\nbe a mechanism for  liberal discharge of debt.   Even Chapter\r\n\n7,  the  Code  section  under which  debtor  currently  seeks\r\n\nrelief,  reflects that  purpose  by entitling  debtors to  \"a\r\n\ndischarge of all debts except obligations . .  . specifically\r\n\nexcept[ed] from  discharge.\"   Jerome M.

Section  523(a)(8), in  contrast,\r                \r\n\ndeparts  significantly  from  the   liberal  dischargeability\r\n\npolicy manifested in  the bankruptcy laws.   In re Alibayata,\r                                                                        \r\n\n178  B.R. 335, 337 (E.D.N.Y.  1995).  From  its inception, it\r\n\nhas operated as  a limit on code sections such  as Chapter 7,\r\n\nprimarily  on the theory that the there are some instances in\r\n\nwhich  a creditor's  interest in  recovering full  payment of\r\n\ndebts  outweighs the  debtor's interest  in a  complete fresh\r\n\nstart.    See Grogan  v.

In re Lohman, 79 B.R. 576, 580 (D. Vt.\r                                               \r\n\n1987). \r\n\n          We  are  convinced  that  treating  federal  credit\r\n\nunions   as   \"government   instrumentalities\"   and,   thus,\r\n\n\"government  units,\" is  consistent with  Section 523(a)(8)'s\r\n\ndischarge-limiting purpose.   \"By enacting Section 523(a)(8),\r\n\nCongress  sought principally  to protect  government entities\r\n\nand nonprofits -- places which  lend money or guarantee loans\r\n\nto individuals for  educational purposes  -- from  bankruptcy\r\n\ndischarge.\"  In  re Segal, 57 F.3d at 348.  Including federal\r                                     \r\n\ncredit  unions within  the universe  of entities  regarded as\r\n\ngovernment units under Section 523(a)(8), in accord with this\r\n\npurpose,  reduces  opportunities  for   dischargeability  and\r\n\nminimizes opportunities for fraud.  \r\n\n          Without imputing any fraudulent intent to DelBonis,\r\n\nwe point  out that  narrowly construing the  term \"government\r\n\nunit\"  to  exclude  federal  credit  unions  would  create  a\r\n\nperverse incentive for educational  debtors.  A definition of\r\n\n\"government  unit\" which excludes federal credit unions would\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\nencourage    debtors   to    circumvent   nondischargeability\r\n\nprovisions  by taking all their school loans out with federal\r\n\ncredit unions or,  as in  the present case,  having a  family\r\n\nmember do  so.  Educational loan programs  could be decimated\r\n\nby this  and millions  of students, individuals  probably not\r\n\nunlike the members of debtor's family who benefitted from his\r\n\ndealings  with  TIFCU,  would ultimately  be  precluded  from\r\n\npursuing opportunities in higher education.  See H.R. No. 95-\r                                                            \r\n\n595, reprinted in App. 2 Collier, pt.

And we\r\n\nnote, though it does not bear directly on our  interpretation\r\n\nof  Section 523(a)(8),  that it  would undermine  the Federal\r\n\nCredit Union Act  as well.   One of the Federal  Credit Union\r\n\nAct's primary goals is  to \"make more available to  people of\r\n\nsmall means credit for provident purposes.\"  12 U.S.C.   1751\r\n\net seq.   Allowing educational loans issued by federal credit\r                  \r\n\nunions to be freely  discharged in bankruptcy could devastate\r\n\nmany federal credit unions.  Because loans comprise the major\r\n\npart  of  the  federal  credit union  investments,  it  would\r\n\ndrastically decrease opportunities  for working class  people\r\n\nto obtain credit.    Federal credit unions, as  mutual thrift\r\n\ninstitutions,  rely on  members  like DelBonis  to repay  the\r\n\ndebts they accrue, even if those debts are incurred on behalf\r\n\n                             -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\nof  a non-member relative.  Cf. In  re Wilcon, 143 B.R. 4 (D.\r                                                         \r\n\nMass.  1992)  (holding  Section  523(a)(8)  includes debt  of\r\n\nparent taken out on behalf of a child).       \r\n\n          We   think  it  extremely  unlikely  that  Congress\r\n\nascribed a meaning to \"government unit\" which would frustrate\r\n\nnot  one, but two of its  legislative enactments.  Therefore,\r\n\nwe  hold that,  federal  credit unions  are government  units\r\n\nwithin the  purpose  and meaning  of 11  U.S.C.    523(a)(8).\r\n\nAbsent  the   applicability  of   one  or  both   of  Section\r\n\n523(a)(8)'s exceptions, the loans debtor obtained from  TIFCU\r\n\nare  nondischargeable.

Sec. 523(a)(8).  The District Court for the District of Massachusetts reversed a bankruptcy court order granting DelBonis summary judgment.  Debtor's appeal from that decision asks us to do two things:  reverse the district court's holding that federal credit unions are nonprofit organizations and hold that educational loans issued to him by creditor-appellee TI Federal Credit Union are, therefore, dischargeable in bankruptcy.  We deny both requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, we affirm the result achieved by the district court--that debtor's loans are nondischargeable--and elect not to reach the issue of federal credit unions' nonprofit status.  Because our conclusion that federal credit unions qualify as government units within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8) provides a sufficient legal basis for upholding the district court's order, we reserve the issue of whether such organizations qualify as nonprofit organizations within the meaning of that statute for another day.

THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Financial difficulties caused defendant-appellant John Carl DelBonis (\"DelBonis\") to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on September 20, 1993.  DelBonis's Chapter 7 application, which he filed in the Eastern District of Massachusetts, listed, inter alia, educational loans he obtained on behalf of his wife and children as debts to be discharged.  The loans, from which DelBonis obtained no direct personal benefit and on which he is the sole obligor, were acquired from the Texas Instrument Federal Credit Union, (\"TIFCU\") while DelBonis was employed at Texas Instruments, Inc.  DelBonis's employment with Texas Instruments, Inc., one of nine institutional members of TIFCU, terminated in November, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chartered on May 9, 1960, pursuant to the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1751 et seq., TIFCU is a federal credit union and has its principal place of business in Attleboro, Massachusetts.  Like most federal credit unions, TIFCU provides a variety of credit, savings, and financial counseling services to its members.  Loans--educational;  home equity;  residential real estate;  and member business--however, represent TIFCU's primary investment.  Cf. National Credit Union Administration, Office of Examination and Insurance, Federal Credit Union Handbook 11 (1988).  Because TIFCU is a federal credit union, its loan activities are heavily regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (\"NCUA\").  See generally 12 C.F.R. Ch. VII (1-1-95 Edition).  NCUA exists within the executive branch of the federal government and was established in 1970 to \"prescrib[e] rules and regulations for the organization and operation of federal credit unions....\"  Federal Credit Union Handbook, supra, at 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DelBonis took out his first educational expense loan with TIFCU on December 27, 1985, for the sum of $3,500.00.  TIFCU advanced the loans as part of a special educational loan program.  The program, which was not federally guaranteed, had several attractive features.  It made loans at low interest rates, gave borrowers longer repayment periods, and allowed loans to be aggregated in maximum amounts greater than those permitted under personal loan programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the most appealing features of TIFCU's educational loan program was that it enabled borrowers to simultaneously borrow additional funds and refinance outstanding balances on previous loans.  DelBonis took advantage of this feature on numerous occasions.  Under the requirements of the loan program, the proceeds from each transaction were paid directly to the educational institution DelBonis specified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the period spanning December 27, 1985 to January 4, 1991, DelBonis turned to TIFCU sixteen times for assistance in meeting his family's educational needs.  Each time TIFCU responded by granting him the funds he requested.  In fact, TIFCU advanced a total of $43,114.87 in loan proceeds on DelBonis's behalf.  DelBonis ultimately asked and was permitted to consolidate these loans into a single promissory note for $39,064.46, payable over ten years, with interest at 9.6% per annum.  A principal balance of $32,618.27 is currently due on that amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1993, nine months after DelBonis filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and, thereby, sought to avoid repayment of his loan debt, TIFCU initiated a bankruptcy court adversary proceeding.  TIFCU requested a determination as to whether 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8) rendered the educational loans issued to DelBonis nondischargeable in bankruptcy.  TIFCU argued that its status as a nonprofit required a finding of nondischargeability under the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months after the adversary proceedings began, the parties submitted an Agreed Statement of Fact to the bankruptcy court.  That document included the erroneous stipulation that \"TIFCU is not a governmental unit....\"  Agreed Statement of Fact at 2.  DelBonis filed a motion for summary judgment on June 6, 1994, almost immediately after the Agreed Statement of Fact was filed with the bankruptcy court.  His summary judgment motion raised two issues bearing on 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8)'s applicability in this case:  1) whether TIFCU is a nonprofit institution;  and 2) whether debtor's loans became due within the seven-year period prescribed by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment on the first issue and, based on its analysis, did not reach the second issue.  The bankruptcy court found that \"loans incurred to educate members of a debtor's family qualify as educational loans within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8).\"  In re Delbonis, 169 B.R. 1, 2 (Bankr.D.Mass.1994).  It ruled, however, that federal credit unions are not nonprofit organizations entitled to Section 523(a)(8) protection because they are comprised of member-shareholders and are authorized to issue dividends to such members.  Id.  The bankruptcy court found that nonprofit organizations do not possess such characteristics.  Id. at 3-4.   The bankruptcy court acknowledged that TIFCU's suit raised a novel issue of law and, therefore, denied debtor's requests for fees and costs.  Id. at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TIFCU appealed the bankruptcy court's decision on June 28, 1994 and filed a Motion to Amend the Agreed Statement of Fact on the ground that it included a stipulation erroneously denying TIFCU's legal status as a government unit.  The bankruptcy court denied TIFCU's Motion to Amend on July 11, 1994.  TIFCU subsequently filed a new Notice of Appeal challenging both the bankruptcy court's summary judgment order and denial of the Motion to Amend the Agreed Statement of Fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the district court reversed the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment.  It held that federal credit unions qualify as nonprofit organizations under Section 523(a)(8) and issued a detailed opinion outlining the legal and policy-based justifications for such a classification.  Id. at 5.   Our decision in La Caisse Populaire Ste.  Marie v. United States, 563 F.2d 505 (1st Cir.1977), defining a credit union as \"a democratically controlled, cooperative, nonprofit society organized for the purpose of encouraging thrift and self-reliance among its members ...,\" was cited as support for the district court's reversal.  Id. at 4-5 (quoting La Caisse Populaire Ste.  Marie v. United States, 563 F.2d 505, 509 (1st Cir.1977)).  La Caisse held that state credit unions are entitled to general income tax exemption under Section 501(c)(14)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Because the ground on which it based its decision independently warranted a finding that debtor's loans are nondischargeable, the district court deemed it unnecessary to \"reach the question whether [the bankruptcy court judge] should have allowed the appellant's motion to amend its agreed statement of facts regarding ... [TIFCU's] status as a federal instrumentality.\"  Id. at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE STATUTE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Resolution of this case, as the following discussion reveals, requires us to consider a gaggle of statutes and statutory issues.  Questions about the status of federal credit unions implicate the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1751 et seq., bankruptcy law, and the federal income tax code.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 501.  Because the possibilities for confusion run high, we think it important to clearly set out the terms of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8), the statute on the basis of which TIFCU initiated the adversary proceeding.  In relevant part, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b) or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>(8) for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made, insured or guaranteed by a government unit, or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution, or for an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship or stipend, unless--(A) such loan, benefit, scholarship, or stipend overpayment first became due more than 7 years (exclusive of any applicable suspension of the repayment period) before the date of the filing of the petition;  or (B) excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an un-due hardship on the debtor and the debtor's dependents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, Section 523(a)(8) offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a federal credit union nondischargeable.  First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpayments are nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifying as a nonprofit organization.  Second, the statute also makes loans issued, insured, or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable.  A debtor's loans, thus, are nondischargeable if they fall within the parameters of either provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress delineates only two exceptions to this nondischargeability policy.  A demonstration that the educational loan, benefit, scholarship, or stipend at issue in the case first became due more than seven years before the filing of the bankruptcy petition excepts a debtor from the statute.  Finally, evidence that nondischargeability will impose an undue hardship on debtor or debtor's dependents provides a basis for circumventing nondischargeability.  The hardship alleged, however, must be undue and attributable to truly exceptional circumstances, such as illness or the existence of an unusually large number of dependents.  In re Lohman, 79 B.R. 576, 581 (Bankr.D.Vt.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far, this case has primarily traveled down the analytical path carved out by Section 523(a)(8)'s nonprofit organization provision.  In the adversary proceeding conducted before the bankruptcy court, TIFCU's principal argument for nondischargeability of DelBonis's loans was that it qualified as a nonprofit organization within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8).  Similarly, both the bankruptcy court and the district court, albeit with different results, focused solely on whether federal credit unions are nonprofits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable basis for assuming such an analytical tack exists, to be sure.  Numerous other courts have fixed their nondischargeability analyses on questions pertaining to the, oftentimes, fine distinctions between nonprofit and for-profit entities.  Unfortunately, a reading of their decisions suggests that no clear consensus on these questions has been reached.  See In re Roberts, 149 B.R. 547 (C.D.Ill.1993) (\"[I]t is not disputed that the Credit Union is a nonprofit institution.\");  TI Federal Credit Union v. Delbonis, 183 B.R. 1, 1 (D.Mass.1995);  Compare with In re Sinclair-Ganos, 133 B.R. 382 (Bankr.W.D.Mich.1991) (\"[T]his court holds that a credit union is not a nonprofit institution under 11 U.S.C. section 523(a)(8));  and In re Simmons, 175 B.R. 624 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1994) (\"[T]he credit union in the case at bar is not a nonprofit institution within the scope of section 523(a)(8)\").  Disagreements over whether courts should concentrate on an organization's articulated purpose, specific financial activities, or competitiveness with other for-profit institutions in making nonprofit status determinations abound.  Compare TI Federal Credit Union, 183 B.R. at 1 with In re Delbonis, 169 B.R. 1 and In re Roberts, 149 B.R. at 547.   Consequently, no clear test for \"determining when a nonprofit institution is--or is not--a nonprofit institution under section 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code\" has been formulated.  In re Roberts, 149 B.R. at 551;  see also 18 Am.Jur.2d, Corporations Sec. 32 at 827 (\"The words 'profit' or 'nonprofit' have no definite meaning or general application....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this discord, we are satisfied that the district court's focus on whether federal credit unions are nonprofits was misplaced.  Sound judicial policy counsels against deciding complicated legal issues where a clear, principled, alternative basis for reaching the same result exists.  Cf. Walmac Co. v. Isaacs, 220 F.2d 108, 113 (1st Cir.1955).  TIFCU's appeal of the bankruptcy court's denial of its Motion to Amend the Agreed Statement of Fact gave the district court an opportunity to decide this case under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8)'s government unit provision.  That provision provides us with a principled, alternative basis for affirming the district court's nondischargeability order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the nonprofit provision, the government unit prong of the Section 523(a)(8) is unambiguous and not particularly difficult to interpret.  In re Pelkowski, 990 F.2d 737, 741-42 (3rd Cir.1993).  And the law establishes that federal credit unions perform important governmental purposes and operate as federal instrumentalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the substantive issues underlying our conclusion that federal credit unions are government units within the meaning of Section 523(a)(8), we must confront the threshold issue of whether the question of TIFCU's status as a government unit is properly before us.  We, therefore, begin our discussion by evaluating the procedural propriety of our deciding this case on that basis.  The substantive issues underlying our judgment that debtor's loans are nondischargeable will be discussed thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Stipulations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our judicial system, \"[s]tipulations fairly entered into are favored.\"  Burstein v. United States, 232 F.2d 19, 23 (8th Cir.1956).  Factual stipulations tend to \"expedite a trial and eliminate the necessity of much tedious proof.\"  Id.  As a result, \"parties to a lawsuit are free to stipulate to factual matters.\"  Saviano v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 765 F.2d 643, 645 (7th Cir.1985).  They are, however, not generally free to extricate themselves from those stipulations once crafted.  Due to the interest in preserving the efficiency attained through stipulations, \"[t]he general rule ... [is] that stipulations of attorneys made during a trial may not be disregarded or set aside at will....\"  Marshall v. Emersons Ltd., 593 F.2d 565, 569 (4th Cir.1979) (citing Maryland Cas. Co. v. Rickenbaker, 146 F.2d 751, 753 (4th Cir.1944));  see also 73 Am.Jur.2d, Stipulation Sec. 1 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Litigation stipulations can be understood as the analogue of terms binding parties to a contract.  As in contract law though, rules limiting litigants to trial stipulations are not absolute.  Marshall, 593 F.2d at 569.   Case law is clear that \"a stipulation of counsel originally designed to expedite the trial should not be rigidly adhered to when it becomes apparent that it may inflict a manifest injustice upon one of the contracting parties.\"  Id. at 568.   Parties will usually be relieved of their stipulations where it becomes evident that \"the agreement was made under a clear mistake.\"  Brast v. Winding Gulf Colliery Co., 94 F.2d 179, 180 (4th Cir.1938).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relief from erroneous stipulations is especially favored where the mistake made concerns a legal conclusion.

It primarily requires us to consider not facts, but law and various legal authorities--i.e., federal statutes;  case law;  and legislative history.  To the extent, if at all, factual considerations enter our analytical picture, it will be only to help us reach the proper legal conclusion on the question now before us.  TIFCU's erroneous stipulation does not bind this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No injustice flows from our decision to relieve TIFCU from the burden of its erroneous stipulation.  See Marshall, 593 F.2d at 568.   Debtor's position, admittedly, is not aided by our decision to set TIFCU's stipulation aside.  We think it fairly obvious though, that a far greater harm would be effectuated by allowing that stipulation to stand.  Important federal bankruptcy and loan policies are at stake in this litigation, not merely DelBonis's personal financial difficulties, however unfortunate and burdensome they may be.  It was error for the bankruptcy court to refuse to allow TIFCU to amend the Agreed Statement of Facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Appeals and Lower Court Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the issue of whether federal credit unions qualify as government units under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8) remains an open issue, we move on to consider a second, but not unrelated, procedural question:  Does the district court's decision not to evaluate TIFCU's appeal from the bankruptcy court's denial of its Motion to Amend the Agreed Statement of Fact preclude us from addressing that issue?   The answer to this question is an unqualified no.  A district court's failure to decide an issue raised by a party and adequately supported by the facts contained in the record does not move that issue beyond an appellate court's purview.

While it is axiomatic that, except in exceptional circumstances, parties may not surprise appellate courts with new issues, we do not find ourselves faced with a situation in which a party has conjured up an issue for appellate review without first presenting it to the trial court.  See Johnston v. Holiday Inns, 595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir.1979);  see also Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp.

TIFCU raised the issue of its status as a government instrumentality on two separate occasions.  Its effort to amend the Agreed Statement of Facts and to, thereby, correct the erroneous legal conclusion that federal credit unions are not government units, coupled with its appeal of the bankruptcy court's denial of that motion, preserved the issue for our review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TIFCU has fulfilled its obligation to squarely raise those issues most pertinent to the resolution of its entire case.

Contrary to what debtor might have us believe, the rule that binds parties to their arguments is not inflexible.

Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 628 (1st Cir.1995), stands for the proposition that cases involving important constitutional or governmental issues may be exceptional and, as such, there should be a full treatment of all legal issues involved, whether squarely introduced by the parties or not.  See Baybank-Middlesex v. Ralar Distributors, Inc., 69 F.3d 1200, 1202 (1st Cir.1995);  cf. Lebron v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 961, 965, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995) (permitting a party to raise an issue it expressly disavowed and did not raise until after certiorari was granted) (\"parties ...

National Ass'n of Social Workers addressed the constitutionality of Rhode Island House of Representatives Rule 45, banning \"lobbyist and lobbying from the floor of the House while the House is in session....\"  Id. at 625.   The district court held that Rule 45 violated the free speech clause of the First Amendment.  We reversed the district court, holding that legislative immunity thwarted the constitutional attack, even though that issue had not previously been raised by either of the parties.  We departed from the rule limiting parties to their lower court arguments because we recognized the issue presented by the case as important, \"of great public moment.\"  Id. at 628.   It implicated matters \"as basic as federalism, comity, and respect for the independence of democratic institutions.\"  Id. National Ass'n of Social Workers makes us doubly certain of the procedural propriety of deciding this case.  The present case fits squarely into the mold cast by National Ass'n of Social Workers and the cases we have deemed \"exceptional\" in the past.  See United States v.

We are convinced that a miscarriage of justice would be worked by a failure to address the governmental status of federal credit unions because the governmental issues that question implicates are so important.  The continued viability of educational loan programs and the stability of federal credit unions impact the health of the national economy and the country's educational system.  As we indicated in the previous section, whether federal credit unions qualify as government units under Section 523(a)(8) is \"strictly a question of law\" and can be resolved on the basis of the existing record.  La Guardia, 902 F.2d at 1013.   It requires no additional factfinding or further argument;  the parties are not prejudiced in any way by the lack of another opportunity to reargue their case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it likely that questions about the government unit status of federal credit unions will resurface in future cases, in virtually \"identical terms.\"  Id.  The dischargeability of loans under Section 523(a)(8) continues to be a heavily litigated area.  Finally, we are convinced that the result achieved by the district court was correct.  And \"[i]n the review of judicial proceedings ... [it] is settled that, if the decision below is correct, it must be affirmed, although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason.\"  Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245, 58 S.Ct. 154, 158, 82 L.Ed. 224 (1937).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can identify no legitimate reason to decline to chart the alternative course we see in this case.  Additionally, we are certain that remanding at this point in the case would be a colossal waste of judicial resources.  See Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corporation, 318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459-60, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943).  Nothing would be gained by asking the district court to reinstate its holding and to tackle a legal question which falls well within our current power to formulate.  Id.  Accordingly, we proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>C. Are Federal Credit Unions Federal Instrumentalities?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"government unit,\" as employed in 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8), means:  \"United States;  State;  Commonwealth;  District;  Territory;  municipality;  foreign state;  department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, ... a State, a Commonwealth, a District, a Territory, a municipality, or a foreign state;  or other foreign or domestic government.\"  11 U.S.C. Sec. 101.  Legislative history suggests that Congress intended to \"defin[e] 'government unit' in the broadest sense.\"   H.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Session 311 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 5759, 5963, 6268, reprinted in App. 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, pt. II, at 311 (Lawrence P. King, ed., 15th ed. 1995).  We think it evident, based on this, that 11 U.S.C. Sec. 101 encompasses federal credit unions as federal instrumentalities, but refrain from making a categorical holding to that effect at this juncture.  The legislative history indicates that Congress meant to temper its exhortation to define broadly.  According to that history, we must demonstrate that federal credit unions have an active relationship with the federal government, that they carry out some governmental function.  Id.  \" '[I]nstrumentality' does not include entities that owe their existence to State action such as the granting of a charter or a license, but that have no other connection with a State or local government or the Federal Government.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether federal credit unions are federal instrumentalities, thus, depends on the types of functions such organizations perform.  We are aware of no settled process for assessing the governmental character of a particular function or service.  In the area of federal instrumentality decisions, we lack the advantage of any bright line rules or tests.  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston v. Comm'r of Corporations and Taxation, 499 F.2d 60, 64 (1st Cir.1974);  see also United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d at 806 (citing Dep't of Employment v. United States, 385 U.S. 355, 358-59, 87 S.Ct. 464, 467, 17 L.Ed.2d 414 (1966) (\"[T]here is no simple test for ascertaining whether an institution is so closely related to government activity as to become a tax-immune instrumentality\")).  As a result, we rest our decision on a combination of statutory interpretation, case law, and consideration of the factors relevant to federal instrumentality determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the most \"significant factor in determining whether a particular entity is a federal instrumentality is whether it performs an important government function.\"  United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d 803, 806 (6th Cir.188);  see also Federal Land Bank v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U.S. 95, 62 S.Ct. 1, 86 L.Ed. 65 (1941).  In response to devastating Depression era losses--failed banks;  high interest rates;  diminished credit opportunities--Congress created scores of federal organizations and corporations designed to stabilize the national economy and pursue other governmental ends.  See generally Lebron, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 969-71 (detailing the history of federal corporations in the United States and explaining that even the denial of federal instrumentality status in enabling legislation is not dispositive in federal instrumentality determinations);  see also Reconstruction Finance Corporation, 306 U.S. at 391, n. 3, 59 S.Ct. at 518-19, n. 3 (listing federal credit unions among a list of forty corporations Congress provided to discharge governmental functions).  As part of this rehabilitative effort, the Congress created federal credit unions by enacting the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1751 et seq., in 1934.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The express purpose of the Federal Credit Union Act, articulated in its long title, was:  \"[T]o establish a Federal Credit Unions System, to establish a further market for securities of the United States and to make more available to people of small means credit for provident purposes through a national system of cooperative credit, thereby helping to stabilize the credit structure of the United States.\"  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1751, reprinted in Credit Union National Association, Inc., Legislative History of the Federal Credit Union Act:  A Study of the Historical Development From 1934 to 1980 of the Statute Governing Federal Credit Unions; \"  see also Branch Bank &amp; Trust v.

In effect, the Federal Credit Union Act created a localized and liberalized system of federal credit services.  It modeled that system on the strong network of state and local credit unions already established at the time.  That network started functioning in the early twentieth century, with the occurrence of two important events, the founding of the first United States-based credit union, La Caisse Populaire, in 1908 and the enactment of the first comprehensive credit union statute, the Massachusetts Credit Union Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 171, Sec. 1 et seq., in 1909.  See La Caisse Populaire, 563 F.2d at 505;  J. Moody and G. Fite, The Credit Union Movement:  Origins and Development 1850 to 1980 19-31 (2d ed. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This history demonstrates that federal credit unions were intended to perform a variety of governmental functions.  Our research establishes that they still do.  Federal credit unions enable the federal government to make credit available to millions of working class Americans.  These organizations, often described as \"cooperative association[s] organized ... for the purpose of promoting thrift among [their] members and creating a source of credit for provident or productive purposes,\" 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1752, provide credit at reasonable rates to millions of individuals who--because they lack security or, as recent studies show, reside in low income areas or in communities primarily inhabited by racial minorities--would otherwise be unable to acquire it.  Cf. United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d at 806;  see also Federal Credit Union Handbook, at iii;  Anthony D. Taibi, Banking, Finance, and Community Economic Empowerment:  Structure, Economic Theory, Procedural Civil Rights, and Substantive Racial Justice, 107 Harv.L.Rev. 1463 (1994) (describing impact of redlining and credit discrimination on local communities).  Because large financial entities generally refuse to extend credit to individuals without traditionally accepted forms of collateral, entities offering usurious interest rates are too often the only other viable source of credit for many working class people.  See Branch Bank &amp; Trust, 786 F.2d at 621 (outlining formation of credit unions in response to entities offering usurious rates).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the functions performed by federal credit unions are not limited to broadening the availability of credit in the United States.  Federal credit unions are authorized to perform many other governmental functions.  To begin, the Federal Credit Union Act authorizes them to issue loans and dividends to their members.  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1757;  see also 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1763.  It also authorizes federal credit unions to invest their funds in obligations of the United States;  invest in securities;  or make deposits in national banks.  Id.  Indeed, federal credit unions serve as fiscal agents of the United States and depositories for public monies.  United States v. Maine, 524 F.Supp. at 1059;  see also United States v. Michigan, 635 F.Supp. 944, 947 (W.D.Mich.1985), aff'd, 851 F.2d 803 (6th Cir.1988);  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1767(a) (\"Each Federal credit union organized under this chapter ... shall act as fiscal agent of the United States ... [and] [a]ny Federal credit union ... shall be a depository of public money....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such functions have properly been regarded as important governmental functions by other courts.  In Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180, 41 S.Ct. 243, 65 L.Ed. 577 (1921), the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that employment as a fiscal agent of the United States and service as a depository for public monies fulfilled important government purposes.  255 U.S. at 209-11, 41 S.Ct. at 248-49.  Smith exempted farm loans from state taxation because of the governmental functions federal land banks performed and, concomitantly, held that Congress acted within its constitutional authority when it enacted the Federal Farm Loan Act, 39 Stat. 360, as amended by Jan. 18, 1918, 40 Stat. 431.  The Farm Loan Act established federal land banks and joint-stock land banks.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the two decades following the Smith decision, the Court held that federal land banks operated as government instrumentalities on three separate occasions.  See Federal Land Bank of Columbia, S.C. v. Gaines, 290 U.S. 247, 54 S.Ct. 168, 78 L.Ed. 298 (1933);  Federal Land Bank of St. Louis v. Briddy, 295 U.S. 229, 55 S.Ct. 705, 79 L.Ed. 1408 (1935);  and Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U.S. 95, 62 S.Ct. 1, 86 L.Ed. 65 (1941).  In Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U.S. 95, 62 S.Ct. 1, 86 L.Ed. 65 (1941), the Court explained the reasons for this conclusion and emphasized that federal land banks performed the important governmental purpose of extending credit, at low interest rates, to farm borrowers.  314 U.S. at 100, 62 S.Ct. at 4.   Federal credit unions indisputably provide a similar service and reach, by definition, a much \"broader cross-section of the nation's citizens.\"  United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d at 806.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More recently, in 1988, the Sixth Circuit embraced the Supreme Court's conclusions about the governmental importance of extending credit, functioning as a fiscal agent of the United States, and extending credit at low interest rates.  In United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d 803 (6th Cir.1988), the Sixth Circuit found that federal credit unions are government instrumentalities precisely because they perform such functions.  851 F.2d at 806-07.  The court explained that, \"[b]ecause of the important governmental functions performed by federal credit unions, ... we hold that federal credit unions are federal instrumentalities.\"  Id. at 807.   The court then went on to hold that the Supremacy Clause and 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1768 immunize federal credit unions from state taxation.  Id.;  see also United States v. Maine, 524 F.Supp. 1056 (D.Me.1981) (holding that state tax on federal credit unions violated the Supremacy Clause and the Federal Credit Unions Act because federal credit unions are federal instrumentalities).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We appreciate, as debtor pointed out below, that private institutions deliver many of the services performed by federal credit unions.  In the more than sixty years since the Federal Credit Union Act's passage, federal credit unions have, undeniably, increased in number and significantly expanded the services they provide.  Today, these institutions offer an increasingly complicated and complex array of financial services.  United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d at 805;  see generally Federal Credit Union Handbook, supra at 11-14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We firmly reject, however, debtor's argument that this fact militates against a finding in TIFCU's favor.  That federal credit unions now have the capacity to compete on quasi-equal footing with other financial institutions does not alter our conclusion that they perform a predominantly governmental purpose.  We echo the district court's insight that \"the extent to which a federal credit union resembles a bank should [not] be determinative of the issue before the court.\"  TI Federal Credit Union, 183 B.R. at 4.   We also note that internal characteristics, such as limitations on membership and location, distinguish federal credit unions from proprietary institutions such as banks.  Banks, with few exceptions, may do business wherever and with whomever they wish.  Federal credit unions, in contrast, must limit their memberships and, therefore, business operations, to \"groups having a common bond of occupation or association, or to groups within a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district.\"  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1759.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we, like our colleagues on the Sixth Circuit, find two additional features federal credit unions share conclusive--tax exemption and governmental regulation.  Congress, in exempting federal credit unions from federal income taxation, has expressed the view that federal credit unions serve several unique governmental purposes and are, therefore, different from banks.  Section 501(c)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption for \"[a]ny corporation organized under Act of Congress which is an instrumentality of the United States ... if such corporation is exempt from Federal income taxes under such Act as amended and supplemented before July 18, 1984....\"  26 U.S.C. section 501(c)(1)(A)(i).  Because the Federal Credit Union Act expressly provides federal credit unions an exemption from federal, as well as state, territorial, or local taxation, federal credit unions fall within the parameters of this provision.  Cf. La Caisse, 563 F.2d at 509;  see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1768;  see also Rev.Rul. 55-133, superseded by Rev.Rul. 60-169 (\"Federal credit unions are recognized as instrumentalities of the United States within the meaning of section 501(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code\");  Rev.Rul. 60-169 (\"Federal Credit Unions organized and operated in accordance with the Federal Credit Union Act are recognized as instrumentalities of the United States within the meaning of section 501(c)(1) of the Code\");  Bruce R. Hopkins, The Law of Tax-Exempt Organizations 323-24, n. 1 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This tax exemption strengthens our view that Congress regards federal credit unions in a special light.  By this, we do not mean to suggest that a necessary correlation exists between federal instrumentality status and tax exemption.  The Internal Revenue Code itself belies the value in drawing such an inference, for it also provides an exemption for state credit unions under Section 501.  Yet, such entities clearly are not federal instrumentalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The manner in which Congress exempted federal credit unions from taxation is, however, significant.  Congress did not treat federal and state credit unions alike;  it addressed federal and state credit unions in entirely different sections of the Internal Revenue Code.  La Caisse, 563 F.2d at 509.   State credit unions are exempted under Section 501(c)(14), whereas, federal credit unions are exempted under Section 501(c)(1).  Id.  Section 501(c)(14), unlike Section 501(c)(1), neither mentions federal instrumentalities nor draws a direct relationship between the federal government and the services provided by state credit unions.  These aspects of the tax exemption federal credit unions receive support our belief that Congress regards federal credit unions as federal instrumentalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The imprimatur Congress places on federal credit unions by way of tax exemption is not the only additional feature which convinces us of federal credit unions' special status.  Extensive government regulation further distinguishes federal credit unions from ordinary proprietary organizations.  The NCUA administers programs and promulgates regulations for credit union chartering, membership, and governance in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. Sec. 551 et seq.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1752a;  see also 12 C.F.R. Secs. 701.1, 708, 709, 710;  National Credit Union Administration, Chartering and Field of Membership Manual (1994).  It promulgates regulations concerning credit practices, 12 C.F.R. Part 706;  dissemination of savings program information, 12 C.F.R. Secs. 707.1-707.6;  payment of dividends, 12 C.F.R. Sec. 707.7;  and inter alia, insurance and group purchasing plans, 12 C.F.R. Part 721.  Finally, not unlike other executive branch agencies, the NCUA issues revised rulings which provide guidance to credit unions operating in the field.  See 12 C.F.R. Ch. VII (1-1-95 Edition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decentralized system in which federal credit unions operate does not minimize the significance of NCUA's regulatory acts, the weight to be accorded the Federal Credit Union Act's careful delineation of federal credit union powers, or the significance of the other statutes governing federal credit union activities.  See e.g. Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1601 et seq.;   Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1601 et seq.;   Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.;   Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 2801;  and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1692 et seq.   Federal credit unions do not, a fortiori, wield powers akin to those employed by banks because they are member-owned and authorized, through their individual boards of directors, to develop guidelines for their operation or independently make decisions about the services they provide.  Cf. United States v. California Bd. of Equalization, 2 Ca.State Tax Rep.  (CCH), p 400-071, aff'd, 709 F.2d 1518 (9th Cir.1983).  Any suggestion that they do misses, what the Supreme Court, in Federal Land Bank v. Bismark, 314 U.S. 95, 62 S.Ct. 1, 86 L.Ed. 65 (1941) regarded as a fundamental point:  \"[t]he federal government is one of delegated powers, and from that it necessarily follows that any constitutional exercise of its delegated powers is governmental.\"  314 U.S. at 102, 62 S.Ct. at 5.   We refuse to penalize federal credit unions for successfully performing the governmental functions assigned them.  And, therefore, we find that increases in the number of federal credit unions and improvements in federal credit union services indicate that the Federal Credit Union Act's goal of providing credit at reasonable rates is being met.  See United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d at 806.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, moreover, that performance of governmental functions, exemption from federal tax, and extensive government regulation are compelling indicia of federal instrumentality status.  In the past, such factors have persuaded this court to make a finding of government instrumentality status.  In Federal Reserve Bank of Boston v. Comm'r of Corporations and Taxation of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 499 F.2d 60 (1st Cir.1974), for example, we recognized federal reserve banks as federal instrumentalities on the basis of characteristics shared, in large part, by federal credit unions.  Two characteristics of federal credit unions, acting as a depository for public monies and serving as a fiscal agent of the United States, figured prominently in our analysis.  499 F.2d 60, 62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in United States v. State Tax Comm'n, 481 F.2d 963 (1st Cir.1973), we concluded that federal savings and loans associations are federal instrumentalities.  481 F.2d at 969;  see also Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 499 F.2d at 62.   That case, like Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and many of the other cases involving questions of federal instrumentality status, concerned the validity of state taxes imposed on federal entities.  See, e.g., United States v. Michigan, 851 F.2d at 803;  Keifer and Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., 306 U.S. 381, 390 n. 3, 59 S.Ct. 516, 518-19 n. 3, 83 L.Ed. 784 (1939);  United States v. Maine, 524 F.Supp. at 1056;  United States v. California Bd. of Equalization, 2 Ca.State Tax Rep.  (CCH), p 400-071, aff'd, 709 F.2d at 1518.   We held that a Massachusetts tax imposed an impermissible burden on federal savings and loans because it provided a deduction for governmental institutions that were very similar to federal loan associations, but not for federal credit loan associations themselves.  481 F.2d at 963.   In reaching our decision that such organizations are federal instrumentalities, we noted that federal savings and loans are federally created banks, chartered and regulated by an executive branch entity, the Federal Home Loan Board, and that \"they serve the statutory purpose of providing 'local mutual thrift institutions in which people may invest their funds and ... for the financing of homes, ... [a] purpose ... said to affect the welfare of the nation as a whole.\"  481 F.2d at 967-78.   Federal credit unions have similar characteristics and purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. State Tax Comm'n, we, admittedly, indulged the argument that credit unions and federal savings and loans can be distinguished.  But, few, if any, inferences can be drawn from our recognition of such distinctions because United States v. State Tax Comm'n involved state, not federal, credit unions.  State credit unions are altogether different entities;  unlike federal credit unions, they are neither chartered under the Federal Credit Union Act, nor regulated by the NCUA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not, of course, follow that no differences between federal credit unions and federal savings institutions exist.  The United States Supreme Court has itself held that federal credit unions and federal loan associations are \"far from identical.\"  First Federal Sav. and Loan Ass'n of Boston v. State Tax Comm'n, 437 U.S. 255, 260, 98 S.Ct. 2333, 2336, 57 L.Ed.2d 187 (1978).  The basis for its holding, however, rested on the assumption that federal credit unions are more closely tied to the government and its functions than federal loan associations, not less.  As the Court noted when it considered some of the same issues we addressed in United States v. State Tax Comm'n:  Congress has \"long treated federally chartered credit unions differently [and more favorably than] ... federally chartered savings and loan associations.\"  437 U.S. at 260, 98 S.Ct. at 2337.   This special treatment is evident in the tax exemptions exclusively afforded federal credit unions and insurance programs designed to protect federal credit union deposits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it plain that federal credit unions are, as a general matter, federal instrumentalities.  Our statement in Northeast Federal Credit Union v. Neves, 837 F.2d 531 (1st Cir.1988), that federal credit unions are not federal agencies does not detract from this conclusion.  The principles addressed in that case are not directly relevant here.  Furthermore, we make no effort to liken federal credit unions to government agencies;  we are persuaded only that they are government instrumentalities, lesser in scope and in responsibility than actual government agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>D. Is Treating TIFCU As A Governmental Unit Consistent With the Purposes of the Statute?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis in this case does not end with our conclusion that federal credit unions are government instrumentalities.  We must still resolve whether treating federal credit unions as federal instrumentalities and, thus, as government units, is consistent with the purposes of 11 U.S.C. section 523(a)(8).  Each instrumentality must be examined in \"light of its governmental role and the wishes of Congress as expressed in relevant legislation.\"  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 499 F.2d at 64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Section 523(a)(8) was enacted to prevent abuses in student loan programs.  In re Pelkowski, 990 F.2d at 742.   Its history, which begins in 1976 with its precursor, Section 439A of the Education Amendments of 1976, reflects a congressional intent to minimize the opportunities to use bankruptcy as a way of avoiding repayment of student loan debts.  Id.  Section 439A, which limited the dischargeability of only guaranteed or insured educational loans, was enacted after the 1973 Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States described the incidence of debtors attempting to discharge educational loan debts in bankruptcy as \"reprehensible\" and a \"threat to the continuance of educational loan programs.\"   H.R.Doc. No. 93-137, 93d.  Cong., 1st Sess., Pts. I and II (1973), reprinted in App. 2 Collier, pt. I, at 176-77;  see also Jerome M. Organ, Good Faith and the Discharge of Educational Loans in Chapter 13:  Forging A Judicial Consensus, 38 Vand.L.Rev. 1087, 1093-97 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 439A was later reconsidered by the House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, but the nondischargeability policy contemplated nevertheless became part of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 through an amendment made to H.R. 8200.  In re Pelkowski, 990 F.2d at 742.   Representative Allen Ertel introduced the amendment which eventually became Section 523(a)(8), noting that defaults and delinquencies in federal student loan programs increased by more than three hundred percent between 1972 and 1976.  H.R. No. 95-595, 95th Cong. 1st Session (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 5759, 5963, reprinted in App. 2 Collier, pt. II, at 537.  Representative Ertel explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>[T]hese bankruptcies could easily destroy the federal student loan programs....  This problem cannot be permitted to spread nationwide, because destruction of the student loan programs would operate to deny the benefits of higher education to many would-be students who are otherwise qualified for post-high school education or training....  The destruction of student loan programs would represent a tremendous waste of one of this nation's greatest assets, the minds and skills of American youth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  Representative Ertel's statements are noteworthy, though admittedly not conclusive of Congress' intent, In re Pelkowski, 990 F.2d at 743 (citing Consumer Prod.  Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 118, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2061, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980)), because they were supported by a number of legislators.  Id. at 742-43.   Both Senator DeConcini and Representative Edwards mentioned the amendment on the floor of their respective chambers.  See id. at 742.   On the House floor, Representative Edwards also explained that \"Section 523(a)(8) represents a compromise between the House bill and the Senate amendment regarding educational loans.\"   124 Cong.Rec. p. H 11096, reprinted in App. 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, pt. IX, at 101.  Representative Edwards went on to clarify that Section 523(a)(8) would only make educational loans issued by governmental units or nonprofits nondischargeable and that it would broaden the bankruptcy laws in effect at the time by extending coverage to non-federally insured loans.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its original form, Section 523(a)(8) only referred to loans acquired from a \"governmental unit, or a nonprofit institution of higher education for an educational loan.\"   Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549 (1978);  see also In re Segal, 57 F.3d 342 (3rd Cir.1995).  This version of the subsection, however, was short-lived.  Congressional efforts to limit the dischargeability of educational loans by expanding the types of loans or institutions covered by Section 523(a)(8) continued after 1978.  Amendments made in 1979 rewrote Section 523(a)(8) to include \"educational loan[s] made, insured, or guaranteed by a government unit or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or a nonprofit institution of higher education\".  Act of August 14, 1979, Pub.L. No. 96-56, Sec. 3(1), 93 Stat. 387 (1989) (amending 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8) (1979)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, the Bankruptcy Amendment Act of 1984 struck the phrase \"of higher education,\" from Section (a)(8).  P.L. 98-353, section 454(a)(2).  This extended the provisions of that section to all nonprofit loan programs, not merely those associated with an institution of higher education.  When read together, the 1979 and 1984 amendments made nondischargeable loans issued pursuant to an educational loan program operated by a nonprofit organization or a governmental unit and educational loans acquired from a commercial financial institution, if such loans were insured by a governmental unit.  See In re Segal, 57 F.3d 342, 346 (3rd Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amendments made in 1990, by the Crime Control Act of 1990, altered Section 523(a)(8) yet another time.  They expanded nondischargeability to encompass educational loans, as well as educational benefit overpayments and obligations to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship or stipend.  Crime Control Act of 1990, Pub.L. 101-647, Sec. 3621(1), 104 Stat. 4964-4965 (1990) (amending 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8) (1984)).  The 1990 Amendment also made it more difficult for debtors to take advantage of the exceptions to nondischargeability.  It increased from five to seven the number of years which must have elapsed between the date an exception seeking debtor's loans first became due and the filing of the bankruptcy petition.  Id. at section 3621(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against the backdrop of the Bankruptcy Code as a whole, Section 523(a)(8) and the amendments made to it are aberrations from the norm.  Congress drafted the Bankruptcy Code to effectuate the \"general purpose of providing debtors with 'a new opportunity in life with a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt.' \"  In re Alibatya, 178 B.R. 335, 337 (E.D.N.Y.1995) (quoting Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 54 S.Ct. 695, 78 L.Ed. 1230 (1934)).  The Code, thus, was intended to be a mechanism for liberal discharge of debt.  Even Chapter 7, the Code section under which debtor currently seeks relief, reflects that purpose by entitling debtors to \"a discharge of all debts except obligations ... specifically except[ed] from discharge.\"   Jerome M. Organ, \"Good Faith\" and the Discharge of Educational Loans in Chapter 13:  Forging A Judicial Consensus, 38 Vand.L.Rev. 1087, 1093 (1985);  see also 11 U.S.C. Sec. 727(b).  Section 523(a)(8), in contrast, departs significantly from the liberal dischargeability policy manifested in the bankruptcy laws.  In re Alibatya, 178 B.R. 335, 337 (E.D.N.Y.1995).  From its inception, it has operated as a limit on code sections such as Chapter 7, primarily on the theory that the there are some instances in which a creditor's interest in recovering full payment of debts outweighs the debtor's interest in a complete fresh start.  See Grogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 287, 111 S.Ct. 654, 659-60, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991).  Thus, whereas the Bankruptcy Code focuses on the impact financial problems have on individual debtors, Section 523(a)(8) concentrates on the impact individual debtor's have on future educational debtors and institutional creditors, particularly unsecured creditors like TIFCU.  Cf. In re Alibatya, 178 B.R. at 337.   Section 523(a)(8) sends the clear message that the interest in ensuring the continued existence and operation, the educational loan programs of government units and nonprofit organizations supersedes the interest in minimizing the financial difficulties of individual debtors.  See id.;  In re Merchant, 958 F.2d 738, 740 (6th Cir.1992).  Its purpose, essentially, is to preclude certain educational loan debtors from taking unfair advantage of the Code's \"fresh start\" policy.  In re Lohman, 79 B.R. 576, 580 (Bankr.D.Vt.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are convinced that treating federal credit unions as \"government instrumentalities\" and, thus, \"government units,\" is consistent with Section 523(a)(8)'s discharge-limiting purpose.  \"By enacting Section 523(a)(8), Congress sought principally to protect government entities and nonprofits--places which lend money or guarantee loans to individuals for educational purposes--from bankruptcy discharge.\"  In re Segal, 57 F.3d at 348.   Including federal credit unions within the universe of entities regarded as government units under Section 523(a)(8), in accord with this purpose, reduces opportunities for dischargeability and minimizes opportunities for fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without imputing any fraudulent intent to DelBonis, we point out that narrowly construing the term \"government unit\" to exclude federal credit unions would create a perverse incentive for educational debtors.  A definition of \"government unit\" which excludes federal credit unions would encourage debtors to circumvent nondischargeability provisions by taking all their school loans out with federal credit unions or, as in the present case, having a family member do so.  Educational loan programs could be decimated by this and millions of students, individuals probably not unlike the members of debtor's family who benefitted from his dealings with TIFCU, would ultimately be precluded from pursuing opportunities in higher education.  See H.R. No. 95-595, 95th Cong. 1st Session (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 5759, 5963, reprinted in App. 2 Collier, pt. II, at 537 (Remarks of Representative Ertel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result clearly would be in conflict with the legislative goals manifested in Section 523(a)(8).  And we note, though it does not bear directly on our interpretation of Section 523(a)(8), that it would undermine the Federal Credit Union Act as well.  One of the Federal Credit Union Act's primary goals is to \"make more available to people of small means credit for provident purposes.\"  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1751 et seq.   Allowing educational loans issued by federal credit unions to be freely discharged in bankruptcy could devastate many federal credit unions.  Because loans comprise the major part of the federal credit union investments, it would drastically decrease opportunities for working class people to obtain credit.  Federal credit unions, as mutual thrift institutions, rely on members like DelBonis to repay the debts they accrue, even if those debts are incurred on behalf of a non-member relative.  Cf. In re Wilcon, 143 B.R. 4 (D.Mass.1992) (holding Section 523(a)(8) includes debt of parent taken out on behalf of a child).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it extremely unlikely that Congress ascribed a meaning to \"government unit\" which would frustrate not one, but two of its legislative enactments.  Therefore, we hold that, federal credit unions are government units within the purpose and meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8).  Absent the applicability of one or both of Section 523(a)(8)'s exceptions, the loans debtor obtained from TIFCU are nondischargeable.  This case is remanded to the bankruptcy court for a determination of whether either of the exceptions to Section 523(a)(8) nondischargeability are applicable in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 523(a)(8).  The District Court for the District of Massachusetts reversed a bankruptcy court order granting DelBonis summary judgment.  Debtor's appeal from that decision asks us to do two things:  reverse the district court's holding that federal credit unions are nonprofit organizations and hold that educational loans issued to him by creditor-appellee TI Federal Credit Union are, therefore, dischargeable in bankruptcy.  We deny both requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, we affirm the result achieved by the district court--that debtor's loans are nondischargeable--and elect not to reach the issue of federal credit unions' nonprofit status.  Because our conclusion that federal credit unions qualify as government units within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8) provides a sufficient legal basis for upholding the district court's order, we reserve the issue of whether such organizations qualify as nonprofit organizations within the meaning of that statute for another day.  Jurisdiction of this appeal stems from 28 U.S.C. Sec. 158(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Financial difficulties caused defendant-appellant John Carl DelBonis (\"DelBonis\") to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on September 20, 1993.  DelBonis's Chapter 7 application, which he filed in the Eastern District of Massachusetts, listed, inter alia, educational loans he obtained on behalf of his wife and children as debts to be discharged.  The loans, from which DelBonis obtained no direct personal benefit and on which he is the sole obligor, were acquired from the Texas Instrument Federal Credit Union, (\"TIFCU\") while DelBonis was employed at Texas Instruments, Inc.  DelBonis's employment with Texas Instruments, Inc., one of nine institutional members of TIFCU, terminated in November, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chartered on May 9, 1960, pursuant to the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1751 et seq., TIFCU is a federal credit union and has its principal place of business in Attleboro, Massachusetts.  Like most federal credit unions, TIFCU provides a variety of credit, savings, and financial counseling services to its members.  Loans--educational;  home equity;  residential real estate;  and member business--however, represent TIFCU's primary investment.  Cf. National Credit Union Administration, Office of Examination and Insurance, Federal Credit Union Handbook 11 (1988).  Because TIFCU is a federal credit union, its loan activities are heavily regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (\"NCUA\").  See generally 12 C.F.R. Ch. VII (1-1-95 Edition).  NCUA exists within the executive branch of the federal government and was established in 1970 to \"prescrib[e] rules and regulations for the organization and operation of federal credit unions....\"  Federal Credit Union <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Handbook,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">2</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DelBonis took out his first educational expense loan with TIFCU on December 27, 1985, for the sum of $3,500.00.  TIFCU advanced the loans as part of a special educational loan program.  The program, which was not federally guaranteed, had several attractive features.  It made loans at low interest rates, gave borrowers longer repayment periods, and allowed loans to be aggregated in maximum amounts greater than those permitted under personal loan programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the most appealing features of TIFCU's educational loan program was that it enabled borrowers to simultaneously borrow additional funds and refinance outstanding balances on previous loans.  DelBonis took advantage of this feature on numerous occasions.  Under the requirements of the loan program, the proceeds from each transaction were paid directly to the educational institution DelBonis specified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the period spanning December 27, 1985 to January 4, 1991, DelBonis turned to TIFCU sixteen times for assistance in meeting his family's educational needs.  Each time TIFCU responded by granting him the funds he requested.  In fact, TIFCU advanced a total of $43,114.87 in loan proceeds on DelBonis's behalf.  DelBonis ultimately asked and was permitted to consolidate these loans into a single promissory note for $39,064.46, payable over ten years, with interest at 9.6% per annum.  A principal balance of $32,618.27 is currently due on that amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1993, nine months after DelBonis filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and, thereby, sought to avoid repayment of his loan debt, TIFCU initiated a bankruptcy court adversary proceeding.  TIFCU requested a determination as to whether 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8) rendered the educational loans issued to DelBonis nondischargeable in bankruptcy.  TIFCU argued that its status as a nonprofit required a finding of nondischargeability under the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months after the adversary proceedings began, the parties submitted an Agreed Statement of Fact to the bankruptcy court.  That document included the erroneous stipulation that \"TIFCU is not a governmental unit....\"  Agreed Statement of Fact at 2.  DelBonis filed a motion for summary judgment on June 6, 1994, almost immediately after the Agreed Statement of Fact was filed with the bankruptcy court.  His summary judgment motion raised two issues bearing on 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8)'s applicability in this case:  1) whether TIFCU is a nonprofit institution;  and 2) whether debtor's loans became due within the seven-year period prescribed by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment on the first issue and, based on its analysis, did not reach the second issue.  The bankruptcy court found that \"loans incurred to educate members of a debtor's family qualify as educational loans within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8).\"  In re Delbonis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1828953\"><a href=\"/opinion/1828953/in-re-delbonis/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (Bankr.D.Mass.1994).  It ruled, however, that federal credit unions are not nonprofit organizations entitled to Section 523(a)(8) protection because they are comprised of member-shareholders and are authorized to issue dividends to such members.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1828953\"><a href=\"/opinion/1828953/in-re-delbonis/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The bankruptcy </a></span>court found that nonprofit organizations do not possess such characteristics.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1828953\"><a href=\"/opinion/1828953/in-re-delbonis/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 3-4. </a></span>  The bankruptcy court acknowledged that TIFCU's suit raised a novel issue of law and, therefore, denied debtor's requests for fees and costs.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1828953\"><a href=\"/opinion/1828953/in-re-delbonis/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 4.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TIFCU appealed the bankruptcy court's decision on June 28, 1994 and filed a Motion to Amend the Agreed Statement of Fact on the ground that it included a stipulation erroneously denying TIFCU's legal status as a government unit.  The bankruptcy court denied TIFCU's Motion to Amend on July 11, 1994.  TIFCU subsequently filed a new Notice of Appeal challenging both the bankruptcy court's summary judgment order and denial of the Motion to Amend the Agreed Statement of Fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the district court reversed the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment.

La Caisse held that state credit unions are entitled to general income tax exemption under Section 501(c)(14)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Because the ground on which it based its decision independently warranted a finding that debtor's loans are nondischargeable, the district court deemed it unnecessary to \"reach the question whether [the bankruptcy court judge] should have allowed the appellant's motion to amend its agreed statement of facts regarding ... [TIFCU's] status as a federal instrumentality.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1828953\"><a href=\"/opinion/1828953/in-re-delbonis/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 5.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE STATUTE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Resolution of this case, as the following discussion reveals, requires us to consider a gaggle of statutes and statutory issues.  Questions about the status of federal credit unions implicate the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1751 et seq., bankruptcy law, and the federal income tax code.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 501.  Because the possibilities for confusion run high, we think it important to clearly set out the terms of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8), the statute on the basis of which TIFCU initiated the adversary proceeding.  In relevant part, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b) or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>(8) for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made, insured or guaranteed by a government unit, or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution, or for an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship or stipend, unless--(A) such loan, benefit, scholarship, or stipend overpayment first became due more than 7 years (exclusive of any applicable suspension of the repayment period) before the date of the filing of the petition;  or (B) excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an un-due hardship on the debtor and the debtor's dependents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, Section 523(a)(8) offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a federal credit union nondischargeable.  First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpayments are nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifying as a nonprofit organization.  Second, the statute also makes loans issued, insured, or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable.  A debtor's loans, thus, are nondischargeable if they fall within the parameters of either provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress delineates only two exceptions to this nondischargeability policy.  A demonstration that the educational loan, benefit, scholarship, or stipend at issue in the case first became due more than seven years before the filing of the bankruptcy petition excepts a debtor from the statute.  Finally, evidence that nondischargeability will impose an undue hardship on debtor or debtor's dependents provides a basis for circumventing nondischargeability.  The hardship alleged, however, must be undue and attributable to truly exceptional circumstances, such as illness or the existence of an unusually large number of dependents.

In the adversary proceeding conducted before the bankruptcy court, TIFCU's principal argument for nondischargeability of DelBonis's loans was that it qualified as a nonprofit organization within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8).  Similarly, both the bankruptcy court and the district court, albeit with different results, focused solely on whether federal credit unions are nonprofits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable basis for assuming such an analytical tack exists, to be sure.  Numerous other courts have fixed their nondischargeability analyses on questions pertaining to the, oftentimes, fine distinctions between nonprofit and for-profit entities.  Unfortunately, a reading of their decisions suggests that no clear consensus on these questions has been reached.

In the more than sixty years since the Federal Credit Union Act's passage, federal credit unions have, undeniably, increased in number and significantly expanded the services they provide.  Today, these institutions offer an increasingly complicated and complex array of financial services.  United States v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508762\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Michigan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/508762/united-states-v-state-of-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>;  see generally Federal Credit Union Handbook, supra at 11-14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We firmly reject, however, debtor's argument that this fact militates against a finding in TIFCU's favor.  That federal credit unions now have the capacity to compete on quasi-equal footing with other financial institutions does not alter our conclusion that they perform a predominantly governmental purpose.  We echo the district court's insight that \"the extent to which a federal credit union resembles a bank should [not] be determinative of the issue before the court.\"  TI Federal Credit <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2006284\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Union,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2006284/ti-federal-credit-union-v-delbonis/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>.   We also note that internal characteristics, such as limitations on membership and location, distinguish federal credit unions from proprietary institutions such as banks.  Banks, with few exceptions, may do business wherever and with whomever they wish.  Federal credit unions, in contrast, must limit their memberships and, therefore, business operations, to \"groups having a common bond of occupation or association, or to groups within a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district.\"  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1759.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we, like our colleagues on the Sixth Circuit, find two additional features federal credit unions share conclusive--tax exemption and governmental regulation.  Congress, in exempting federal credit unions from federal income taxation, has expressed the view that federal credit unions serve several unique governmental purposes and are, therefore, different from banks.  Section 501(c)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption for \"[a]ny corporation organized under Act of Congress which is an instrumentality of the United States ... if such corporation is exempt from Federal income taxes under such Act as amended and supplemented before July 18, 1984....\"  26 U.S.C. section 501(c)(1)(A)(i).  Because the Federal Credit Union Act expressly provides federal credit unions an exemption from federal, as well as state, territorial, or local taxation, federal credit unions fall within the parameters of this provision.  Cf. La <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349530\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Caisse,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/349530/la-caisse-populaire-ste-marie-st-marys-bank-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>;  see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1768;  see also Rev.Rul. 55-133, superseded by Rev.Rul. 60-169 (\"Federal credit unions are recognized as instrumentalities of the United States within the meaning of section 501(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code\");  Rev.Rul. 60-169 (\"Federal Credit Unions organized and operated in accordance with the Federal Credit Union Act are recognized as instrumentalities of the United States within the meaning of section 501(c)(1) of the Code\");  Bruce R.

By this, we do not mean to suggest that a necessary correlation exists between federal instrumentality status and tax exemption.  The Internal Revenue Code itself belies the value in drawing such an inference, for it also provides an exemption for state credit unions under Section 501.  Yet, such entities clearly are not federal instrumentalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The manner in which Congress exempted federal credit unions from taxation is, however, significant.  Congress did not treat federal and state credit unions alike;  it addressed federal and state credit unions in entirely different sections of the Internal Revenue Code.  La <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349530\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Caisse,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/349530/la-caisse-populaire-ste-marie-st-marys-bank-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>.   State credit unions are exempted under Section 501(c)(14), whereas, federal credit unions are exempted under Section 501(c)(1).  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349530\"><a href=\"/opinion/349530/la-caisse-populaire-ste-marie-st-marys-bank-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Section 501(c)(14), </a></span>unlike Section 501(c)(1), neither mentions federal instrumentalities nor draws a direct relationship between the federal government and the services provided by state credit unions.  These aspects of the tax exemption federal credit unions receive support our belief that Congress regards federal credit unions as federal instrumentalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The imprimatur Congress places on federal credit unions by way of tax exemption is not the only additional feature which convinces us of federal credit unions' special status.  Extensive government regulation further distinguishes federal credit unions from ordinary proprietary organizations.  The NCUA administers programs and promulgates regulations for credit union chartering, membership, and governance in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. Sec. 551 et seq.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1752a;  see also 12 C.F.R. Secs. 701.1, 708, 709, 710;  National Credit Union Administration, Chartering and Field of Membership Manual (1994).  It promulgates regulations concerning credit practices, 12 C.F.R. Part 706;  dissemination of savings program information, 12 C.F.R. Secs. 707.1-707.6;  payment of dividends, 12 C.F.R. Sec. 707.7;  and inter alia, insurance and group purchasing plans, 12 C.F.R. Part 721.  Finally, not unlike other executive branch agencies, the NCUA issues revised rulings which provide guidance to credit unions operating in the field.  See 12 C.F.R. Ch. VII (1-1-95 Edition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decentralized system in which federal credit unions operate does not minimize the significance of NCUA's regulatory acts, the weight to be accorded the Federal Credit Union Act's careful delineation of federal credit union powers, or the significance of the other statutes governing federal credit union activities.  See e.g. Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1601 et seq.;   Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1601 et seq.;   Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.;   Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 2801;  and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1692 et seq.   Federal credit unions do not, a fortiori, wield powers akin to those employed by banks because they are member-owned and authorized, through their individual boards of directors, to develop guidelines for their operation or independently make decisions about the services they provide.  Cf. United States v. California Bd. of Equalization, 2 Ca.State Tax Rep.  (CCH), p 400-071, aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420620\"><a href=\"/opinion/420620/united-states-v-california-state-bd-of-equalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1518</span> </a></span>(9th Cir.1983).

We refuse to penalize federal credit unions for successfully performing the governmental functions assigned them.  And, therefore, we find that increases in the number of federal credit unions and improvements in federal credit union services indicate that the Federal Credit Union Act's goal of providing credit at reasonable rates is being met.  See United States v. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Michigan,</span> <span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">806</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, moreover, that performance of governmental functions, exemption from federal tax, and extensive government regulation are compelling indicia of federal instrumentality status.  In the past, such factors have persuaded this court to make a finding of government instrumentality status.  In Federal Reserve Bank of Boston v. Comm'r of Corporations and Taxation of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"320298\"><a href=\"/opinion/320298/federal-reserve-bank-of-boston-v-commissioner-of-corporations-and-taxation/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1974), for example, we recognized federal reserve banks as federal instrumentalities on the basis of characteristics shared, in large part, by federal credit unions.  Two characteristics of federal credit unions, acting as a depository for public monies and serving as a fiscal agent of the United States, figured prominently in our analysis.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"320298\"><a href=\"/opinion/320298/federal-reserve-bank-of-boston-v-commissioner-of-corporations-and-taxation/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in United States v.

The basis for its holding, however, rested on the assumption that federal credit unions are more closely tied to the government and its functions than federal loan associations, not less.

This version of the subsection, however, was short-lived.  Congressional efforts to limit the dischargeability of educational loans by expanding the types of loans or institutions covered by Section 523(a)(8) continued after 1978.  Amendments made in 1979 rewrote Section 523(a)(8) to include \"educational loan[s] made, insured, or guaranteed by a government unit or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or a nonprofit institution of higher education\".

P.L. 98-353, section 454(a)(2).  This extended the provisions of that section to all nonprofit loan programs, not merely those associated with an institution of higher education.  When read together, the 1979 and 1984 amendments made nondischargeable loans issued pursuant to an educational loan program operated by a nonprofit organization or a governmental unit and educational loans acquired from a commercial financial institution, if such loans were insured by a governmental unit.

The 1990 Amendment also made it more difficult for debtors to take advantage of the exceptions to nondischargeability.

Congress drafted the Bankruptcy Code to effectuate the \"general purpose of providing debtors with 'a new opportunity in life with a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt.' \"  In re Alibatya, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1917759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1917759/in-re-alibatya/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 337 (E.D.N.Y.1995) (quoting Local Loan Co. v.

Even Chapter 7, the Code section under which debtor currently seeks relief, reflects that purpose by entitling debtors to \"a discharge of all debts except obligations ... specifically except[ed] from discharge.\"   Jerome M. Organ, \"Good Faith\" and the Discharge of Educational Loans in Chapter 13:  Forging A Judicial Consensus, 38 Vand.L.Rev. 1087, 1093 (1985);  see also 11 U.S.C. Sec. 727(b).  Section 523(a)(8), in contrast, departs significantly from the liberal dischargeability policy manifested in the bankruptcy laws.  In re Alibatya, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1917759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1917759/in-re-alibatya/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 337 (E.D.N.Y.1995).  From its inception, it has operated as a limit on code sections such as Chapter 7, primarily on the theory that the there are some instances in which a creditor's interest in recovering full payment of debts outweighs the debtor's interest in a complete fresh start.  See Grogan v. Garner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112522\"><a href=\"/opinion/112522/grogan-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112522\"><a href=\"/opinion/112522/grogan-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span> </a></span>(1991).  Thus, whereas the Bankruptcy Code focuses on the impact financial problems have on individual debtors, Section 523(a)(8) concentrates on the impact individual debtor's have on future educational debtors and institutional creditors, particularly unsecured creditors like TIFCU.  Cf. In re <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1917759\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Alibatya,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1917759/in-re-alibatya/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>.   Section 523(a)(8) sends the clear message that the interest in ensuring the continued existence and operation, the educational loan programs of government units and nonprofit organizations supersedes the interest in minimizing the financial difficulties of individual debtors.  See id.;  In re Merchant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579238\"><a href=\"/opinion/579238/in-re-weiner-merchant-debtor-andrews-university-v-weiner-merchant/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 740 (6th Cir.1992).  Its purpose, essentially, is to preclude certain educational loan debtors from taking unfair advantage of the Code's \"fresh start\" policy.  In re Lohman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1948169\"><a href=\"/opinion/1948169/in-re-lohman/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 580 (Bankr.D.Vt.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are convinced that treating federal credit unions as \"government instrumentalities\" and, thus, \"government units,\" is consistent with Section 523(a)(8)'s discharge-limiting purpose.  \"By enacting Section 523(a)(8), Congress sought principally to protect government entities and nonprofits--places which lend money or guarantee loans to individuals for educational purposes--from bankruptcy discharge.\"  In re <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697682\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Segal,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/697682/in-re-stanton-l-segal-elizabeth-crowe-segal-debtors-santa-fe-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>.   Including federal credit unions within the universe of entities regarded as government units under Section 523(a)(8), in accord with this purpose, reduces opportunities for dischargeability and minimizes opportunities for fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without imputing any fraudulent intent to DelBonis, we point out that narrowly construing the term \"government unit\" to exclude federal credit unions would create a perverse incentive for educational debtors.  A definition of \"government unit\" which excludes federal credit unions would encourage debtors to circumvent nondischargeability provisions by taking all their school loans out with federal credit unions or, as in the present case, having a family member do so.  Educational loan programs could be decimated by this and millions of students, individuals probably not unlike the members of debtor's family who benefitted from his dealings with TIFCU, would ultimately be precluded from pursuing opportunities in higher education.  See H.R. No. 95-595, 95th Cong. 1st Session (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 5759, 5963, reprinted in App. 2 Collier, pt. II, at 537 (Remarks of Representative Ertel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result clearly would be in conflict with the legislative goals manifested in Section 523(a)(8).  And we note, though it does not bear directly on our interpretation of Section 523(a)(8), that it would undermine the Federal Credit Union Act as well.  One of the Federal Credit Union Act's primary goals is to \"make more available to people of small means credit for provident purposes.\"  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1751 et seq.   Allowing educational loans issued by federal credit unions to be freely discharged in bankruptcy could devastate many federal credit unions.  Because loans comprise the major part of the federal credit union investments, it would drastically decrease opportunities for working class people to obtain credit.  Federal credit unions, as mutual thrift institutions, rely on members like DelBonis to repay the debts they accrue, even if those debts are incurred on behalf of a non-member relative.  Cf. In re Wilcon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1836277\"><a href=\"/opinion/1836277/in-re-wilcon/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span> </a></span>(D.Mass.1992) (holding Section 523(a)(8) includes debt of parent taken out on behalf of a child).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it extremely unlikely that Congress ascribed a meaning to \"government unit\" which would frustrate not one, but two of its legislative enactments.  Therefore, we hold that, federal credit unions are government units within the purpose and meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(8).  Absent the applicability of one or both of Section 523(a)(8)'s exceptions, the loans debtor obtained from TIFCU are nondischargeable.  This case is remanded to the bankruptcy court for a determination of whether either of the exceptions to Section 523(a)(8) nondischargeability are applicable in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
