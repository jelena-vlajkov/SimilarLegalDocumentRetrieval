The district judge decided that the\n\ngovernment's guerilla tactics impermissibly  endangered civilians\n\nand  dismissed the ensuing charge.  See United States v. Santana,\n                                                                \n\n808 F. Supp.  77 (D.  Mass. 1992).   The  United States  appeals.\n\nAlthough law enforcement officers  might well profit from reading\n\nthe lower court's  thoughtful opinion, we conclude that the court\n\nexceeded its authority.  Consequently, we reverse.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          In  1991, the  federal Drug  Enforcement Administration\n\n(DEA)  mounted an  elaborate reverse  sting  designed to  bring a\n\nmammoth heroin distribution network to  ground.  The DEA believed\n\nthat defendant-appellee  Rafael Santana ran the  ring from prison\n\nthrough  various  henchmen, including  defendant-appellee Francis\n\nFuentes.  In the course of the sting, Fuentes asked an undercover\n\nagent, posing as  a heroin supplier, to  furnish a sample of  his\n\nwares.    The  agent  received a  special  dispensation  from DEA\n\nhierarchs  and  delivered  13.3 grams  of  heroin,  92%  pure, to\n\n                                2\n\nFuentes  in August of 1991.1  The authorities never recovered the\n\nsample.\n\n          There is a factual dispute over the size of the stakes.\n\nThe  government, based on its  agent's testimony, claims that the\n\ndeal under negotiation contemplated  delivery of 141 kilograms of\n\nheroin.   It further claims, based on an informer's account, that\n\nSantana's  organization was  capable  of distributing  up to  200\n\nkilograms  of  heroin  monthly.     Appellees  suggest  that  the\n\nnegotiations  concerned   a  considerably  smaller   quantity  of\n\nnarcotics, and that the  organization, if it existed at  all, was\n\nfar less ambitious.  We need not  enter this thicket; for present\n\npurposes, the relevant finding is the reasonableness, at the time\n\nthe sample  was furnished,  of the  government's belief that  the\n\nalleged  organization  had  the  capacity  to  manage  widespread\n\ndistribution  of heroin.  It  is not seriously  disputed that the\n\ngovernment  thought  this  to be  the  case;  and, moreover,  the\n\ngovernment's  belief, given both the information in its files and\n\nSantana's history   he  had been convicted in 1990  of conspiracy\n\nto  smuggle   1,000  kilograms   of  heroin      was  objectively\n\nreasonable.\n\n          Having been made privy to the evidence collected in the\n\ncourse  of  the government's  indagation,  a  federal grand  jury\n\n                    \n\n     1The heroin sample comprises  about 2,500 doses of the  size\nand purity  typically sold on the street.  See Gerald F. Uelman &amp;\n                                              \nVictor G. Haddox, Drug Abuse and the Law  Sourcebook,   2.4(a) at\n                                                    \n2-19 (1991).   The DEA  authorized delivery  pursuant to  section\nIII-E  of the DEA's  Domestic Operations Guidelines,  20 Crim. L.\nRep. (BNA) 3055-58 (Feb. 2, 1977).\n\n                                3\n\nreturned  a  three-count  indictment  against  seven  defendants,\n\nincluding appellees,  in October of  1991.  The  defendants filed\n\npretrial motions seeking to dismiss the indictment on  the ground\n\nthat the government acted outrageously in fronting so much heroin\n\nand then losing track of it.  A magistrate judge recommended that\n\nthe  motions   be  denied.    The  district  court  rejected  the\n\nrecommendation.   Presuming that  most of the  unretrieved sample\n\nreached  end users,  see  id. at  79, the  court  found that  the\n                             \n\ngovernment's actions exceeded the bounds of propriety, see id. at\n                                                              \n\n81-84.  It  thereupon dismissed  count 3 of  the indictment  (the\n\ncount  for   which  the   13.3-gram  sample  formed   the  corpus\n                                                                 \n\ndelicti).2  See id.  at 85-86.   The court derived its  authority\n                   \n\nfrom  the  due  process  clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment,  and,\n\nalternatively, from its supervisory power.   See id. at 86.   The\n                                                    \n\ngovernment  moved  unsuccessfully  for reconsideration3  and  now\n\nappeals.  We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.   3731 (1988).\n\n          There  are two main legal points in contention.  First,\n\n                    \n\n     2Count  3 named only Santana  and Fuentes.   Hence, they are\nthe lone appellees.\n\n     3The briefs  highlight several  other factual disputes.   By\nand  large,  these  disputes hinge  on  the  admissibility of  an\naffidavit appended  to the motion  to reconsider    an  affidavit\nwhich  tries to shed  light on the  sample's ultimate disposition\nand  the agent's motive in delivering it.  Because this affidavit\nwas not proffered originally, and because the lower court made no\nfindings concerning it, we  consider only two undisputed portions\nof the affidavit, namely, that the agent, in asking his superiors\nto  arrange for  a  sample, believed  that  \"Fuentes was  testing\nwhether I was a real drug  dealer,\" and that supplying the sample\n\"was  an  important part  of  Fuentes' evaluation  whether  to go\nforward  with the deal.\"   We will assume,  as appellees implore,\nthat most,  if not all, of  the 13.3 grams of  heroin reached end\nusers.\n\n                                4\n\nthe government  denies that its conduct was  outrageous.  Second,\n\nthe  government  asseverates  that   the  district  court  lacked\n\nauthority  under either the due  process clause or  the rubric of\n\nsupervisory  power  to  redress  injuries  to  third  parties  by\n                                                             \n\ndismissing charges against appellees.  On the facts of this case,\n\nwe think that both points are well taken.\n\nII.  THE DOCTRINE OF OUTRAGEOUS MISCONDUCT\n\n          Outrageous   misconduct  is   the  deathbed   child  of\n\nobjective  entrapment, a  doctrine  long since  discarded in  the\n\nfederal  courts.  See, e.g.,  Sherman v. United  States, 356 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n369, 372  (1958) (rejecting  an objective entrapment  approach in\n\nfavor  of a  subjective  approach).   The doctrine's  midwife was\n\nChief  Justice Rehnquist  (then Justice  Rehnquist), who,  in the\n\ncourse  of  championing  a   subjective  theory  of   entrapment,\n\nspeculated that the  Court might  \"some day be  presented with  a\n\nsituation  in which the conduct  of law enforcement  agents is so\n\noutrageous that  due process principles would  absolutely bar the\n\ngovernment   from  invoking  judicial   processes  to   obtain  a\n\nconviction. . . .\"  United States v. Russell, 411  U.S. 423, 431-\n                                            \n\n32 (1972).  Seizing upon this dictum, the defendant in Hampton v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited States,  425 U.S. 484  (1975), attempted  to construct  an\n             \n\noutrageous misconduct  defense rooted in the  due process clause.\n\nHampton lost his case but succeeded in legitimating the doctrine,\n\nalbeit precariously.4\n\n                    \n\n     4In Hampton,  a concurrence  combined with the  plurality to\n                \nreject the appeal.  However, the two concurring Justices switched\nsides  to form  a different  majority vivifying  the  doctrine of\n\n                                5\n\n          Although   it  has   a   comfortably   familiar   ring,\n\n\"outrageous  misconduct\" is  surpassingly difficult  to translate\n\ninto a closely  defined set  of behavioral norms.   The  broadest\n\nhints as to the content of the outrageousness standard lie in the\n\ndictum  that  spawned  the  doctrine.    Inasmuch  as  Rochin  v.\n                                                             \n\nCalifornia, 342  U.S. 165 (1952), is the case irrefragably linked\n          \n\nwith  the legal rubric of fundamental fairness, one hint is found\n\nin Justice Rehnquist's citation to Rochin.  See Russell, 411 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat  431-32.   A second  hint is  contained in  Russell's explicit\n                                                      \n\nequation  of  outrageous  misconduct  with  violations  of  \"that\n\n'fundamental  fairness,  shocking  to  the  universal   sense  of\n\njustice,'  mandated  by  the  Due  Process  Clause  of the  Fifth\n\nAmendment.\"  Russell, 423 U.S. at 432 (quoting Kinsella v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates ex rel. Singleton, 361 U.S. 234, 246  (1960)).  Picking up\n                        \n\non  these clues, most courts  apply a variant  on the fundamental\n\nfairness standard as  a sounding  line for  outrageousness.   See\n                                                                 \n\nMosley, 965 F.2d at 910 (collecting formulations).  Although this\n      \n\nstandard lacks  mathematical  precision, we  agree  with  Justice\n\nFrankfurter that imprecision of this nature does not leave courts\n\nwithout  adequate guidance;  rather, \"[i]n  dealing not  with the\n\nmachinery of  government but with  human rights,  the absence  of\n\nformal  exactitude, or  want  of fixity  of  meaning, is  not  an\n\nunusual  or   even   regrettable  attribute   of   constitutional\n\nprovisions.\"  Rochin, 342 U.S. at 169.\n                    \n\n                    \n\noutrageous  misconduct.

Even though one respected  jurist contends that\n\nthe doctrine belongs in the dustbin of history, see United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Burbine,  475 U.S. 412, 432 (1985) (\"We\n                                 \n\ndo not question that on facts more egregious than those presented\n\nhere police  deception might  rise to  a level  of a  due process\n\nviolation.\"); United  States v.

Indeed, since  the Supreme\n\nCourt  decided Hampton,  a  federal appellate  court has  granted\n                      \n\nrelief to a  criminal defendant  on the basis  of the  outrageous\n\nmisconduct  defense only once.   See United States  v. Twigg, 588\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 373,  382 (3d  Cir. 1978).   The historical record  makes it\n\nclear,  therefore,  that  the  outrageous  misconduct defense  is\n\nalmost never successful.6\n\n          There are two competing visions of the doctrine's role.\n\nOne school of thought  holds that the defense should  be confined\n\nto cases involving extreme  physical, and possibly psychological,\n\nabuse of a defendant.  See United States v. Kelly, 707 F.2d 1460,\n                                                 \n\n1476  n.13 (D.C.  Cir.)

A second school  of thought holds\n      \n\nthat  outrageous  misconduct  may  also  function  as  a  kind of\n\nsupplement to  the entrapment  defense, reserved for  those cases\n\n                    \n\n     6In  addition to  Twigg, one  court  of appeals  invoked the\n                            \ndoctrine in an  alternative holding, see  United States v.  Lard,\n                                                                \n734 F.2d 1290,  1296 (8th  Cir. 1984), and  another directed  the\ndistrict court to determine  whether outrageous misconduct should\nbe  found on remand, see Bogart, 783  F.2d at 1438.  A smattering\n                               \nof district  courts have  also applied the  outrageous misconduct\ndoctrine to the defendant's advantage.   See, e.g., United States\n                                                                 \nv. Marshank, 777  F. Supp.  1507, 1524 (N.D.

This case does not  require us to\n      \n\nchoose between these two conceptions of the doctrine.\n\nIII.  APPLYING THE DOCTRINE\n\n          Having  traced   the  evolution  of  the   doctrine  of\n\noutrageous misconduct,  we proceed to consider  its applicability\n\nin this case.   Although what transpired here fits neither of the\n\nconventional  patterns of outrageous  misconduct described above,\n\nthe district  court nonetheless  ruled that furnishing  the hefty\n\nheroin  sample (and  then losing  track of  it) comes  within the\n\ndoctrine's sweep.  We  conclude, for two independently sufficient\n\nreasons, that the district court erred.\n\n                       A.  Outrageousness.\n                                         \n\n          \"It  is clear that the government may supply drugs to a\n\nsuspect  in  a drug  investigation.\"   Hampton,  425 U.S.  at 491\n                                              \n\n(Powell, J.,  concurring).  When this occurs  in the prototypical\n\ncase,  an   agent  documents  a  malefactor's   acceptance  of  a\n\ngovernment-supplied  sample and  then promptly  arrests him.   In\n\nthis scenario, even a large quantity of government-supplied drugs\n\nwill not raise judicial eyebrows, for the  contraband is regained\n\ncoincident with the arrest.   See, e.g., Barnett, 989 F.2d at 560\n                                                \n\n(declining to find outrageous misconduct where agent sold suspect\n\nenough hydriodic acid to  manufacture 18 kilos of methamphetamine\n\n                                9\n\nbut  recovered it  promptly); United States  v. Gianni,  678 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n956, 960 (11th Cir.)

Nonetheless,\n\nseveral  courts have  held that  providing a  known addict  small\n\nquantities of drugs  in order  to facilitate the  progress of  an\n\nundercover   agent's   work   does   not   constitute  outrageous\n\nmisconduct.  See United States v. Harris,     F.2d    ,     (10th\n                                        \n\nCir.  1993) [No. 92-4001, 1993 WL 232155 at *5-*6]; United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Ford, 918 F.2d 1343, 1349-50 (8th Cir. 1990).\n              \n\n          Common  sense suggests  that, where  the target  of the\n\ninvestigation  is  a  distributor  rather  than  an  addict,  the\n\nquantity  of  drugs  needed  to  earn  or  retain  the  suspect's\n\nconfidence   will  likely   be  larger.7     It   is,  therefore,\n\nunsurprising  that  courts  generally   have  declined  to   find\n\noutrageous  misconduct in  situations  of this  sort despite  the\n\n                    \n\n     7We recognize that narcotics  differ in many ways, including\nsize, weight, and potency; and that, therefore, a small amount of\na  particular drug, say,  heroin, may be much  more lethal than a\nlarger amount  of a different drug, say,  marijuana.  For ease in\nreference, however,  we use  the term \"quantity\"  throughout this\nopinion as a proxy for dangerousness.\n\n                                10\n\ndisappearance  of fairly  substantial  quantities  of  government\n\nsupplied contraband.   See,  e.g., United  States v.  Valona, 834\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1334, 1344-45 (7th Cir. 1987) (declining to  find misconduct\n\nwhere  the government disbursed,  without recovering,  a 3.5-gram\n\nsample  of cocaine while  negotiating sales aggregating  up to 35\n\nkilos); United States v.  Buishas, 791 F.2d 1310, 1314  (7th Cir.\n                                 \n\n1986) (similar; government disbursed,  without recovering, a  69-\n\ngram  sample of  marijuana in  the course  of closing  an 89-kilo\n\ndeal).\n\n          Although  Valona and Buishas are structurally analogous\n                                      \n\nto the case at hand, the government concedes that the quantity of\n\ndrugs given to Fuentes is, in absolute terms, unprecedented.  The\n\nquestion,  then, is whether, at some point, the quantity of drugs\n\ndisbursed  on the government's  behalf may become  so large that,\n\ngiven  all the  attendant  circumstances,  the government's  role\n\nbecomes qualitatively different, i.e., outrageous.\n                                     \n\n          The court below devised a seven-part test and, applying\n\nthat test, determined the  government's actions to be outrageous.\n\nSee Santana, 808 F. Supp. at 81-86.  The court focused on (1) the\n           \n\ntype of drug furnished;  (2) the sample's potency or  purity; (3)\n\nits relative  size; (4) whether  the defendant requested  it; (5)\n\nwhether the  drugs were  recovered; (6)  what likely happened  to\n\nthem;  and (7) whether  the sample itself  constitutes the corpus\n                                                                 \n\ndelicti  of the crime charged in the  indictment.8  Id. at 81-82.\n                                                       \n\n                    \n\n     8In contrast, the relevant DEA guidelines, see supra note 1,\n                                                         \nsuggest  consideration of  (1) the  type and  amount of  the drug\ncontained  in the sample; (2) the likelihood that the sample will\n\n                                11\n\nWe  appreciate  the  district  court's effort  to  structure  the\n\nexercise of  judicial discretion, and  we realize that  the court\n\ndid not intend  its compendium to be exhaustive.   See id. at 82.\n                                                          \n\nNevertheless,   we   do  not   think   that   the  inquiry   into\n\noutrageousness can  usefully  be broken  down  into a  series  of\n\ndiscrete  components.  Almost by definition, the power of a court\n\nto control prosecutorial excesses  through resort to  substantive\n\naspects of  the due process  clause is  called into play  only in\n\nidiosyncratic situations    and such situations are  likely to be\n\nhighly ramified.   Where facts are critically  important and fact\n\npatterns tend  to be  infinitely diverse, adjudication  can often\n\nbest proceed on a case-by-case basis.  The outrageousness defense\n\nfalls into this category.   Thus, it is unproductive to force the\n\ndetermination of outrageousness into a mechanical mode.\n\n          Let   us   be   perfectly   plain.     We   find   that\n\noutrageousness, by its nature,  requires an ad hoc determination.\n                                                  \n\nWe  do not suggest, however, that the assessment should be wholly\n\nunguided.  The calculus must be rooted in the record, and it will\n\noften  be informed  by  the  various  factors enumerated  in  the\n\ndistrict  court's test,  the DEA's  test, see  supra note  8, and\n                                                    \n\n                    \n\nreach consumers;  (3) the number  and prominence of  the suspects\nimplicated;  (4)  the  type  and  amount  of evidence  needed  to\ncomplete the  ongoing investigation; (5) the time  required to do\nso;  and (6) the likelihood of obtaining such evidence.  Although\nthe DEA's list, like the  district court's list, contains factors\nrelevant to the seriousness of harm likely to  be suffered by end\nusers,  the DEA's list emphasizes, and  the court's list slights,\nthe  likelihood   that  the   investigation  will  lead   to  the\nprosecution of important drug dealers.\n\n                                12\n\nsimilar tests produced  by other sources.9   At bottom,  however,\n\noutrageousness is a  concept, not  a constant.   What shocks  the\n\nconscience in a given situation may be acceptable, though perhaps\n\ngrim  or  unpleasant, under  a  different  set of  circumstances.\n\nSlashing  a  person's  throat  with  a  sharp  knife  may  be  an\n\nunrelievedly outrageous  course of conduct if one thinks in terms\n\nof  Jack the Ripper, helpless  women, and the  shadowy streets of\n\nLondon; the same behavior will be thoroughly acceptable, however,\n\nif  the knife is a  scalpel, the knife-wielder  a skilled surgeon\n\nperforming  a tracheotomy, the target a patient, and the venue an\n\noperating room.  Although we recognize that formulaic tests offer\n\nadministrative  convenience  and  ease  in  application,  we also\n\nrecognize that neither life nor law can always be made convenient\n\nand easy.  So here:   there is simply no way to reduce the myriad\n\ncombinations of potentially relevant circumstances to a neat list\n\nof weighted factors without  losing too much in  the translation.\n\nCf.

The\n\noutrageousness  vel non of a police officer's actions can only be\n                       \n\nevaluated by  taking into  account the  totality of  the relevant\n\ncircumstances.  When  the officer is on  the trail of  a criminal\n\nenterprise,  these  circumstances  include  the  identity of  the\n\nsuspects, the gravity of past crimes, and the dangers foreseeably\n\nattributable   to   the   enterprise's   uninterrupted   progress\n\n(including  likely  future  crimes).     In  this  instance,  the\n\ngovernment had  a solid basis  to believe that  Santana's network\n\ncould distribute up  to 200 kilograms of heroin per  month.  Seen\n\nin that light,  it does  not shock our  collective conscience  to\n\nthink that a lawman would dangle  13.3 grams of heroin as bait to\n\nland  such a large-scale ring, even though delivery of the sample\n\nran a palpable risk of ushering it into the marketplace.\n\n          The  district  judge  refused to  honor  this argument,\n\nwhich the magistrate described as setting \"a  big hook to catch a\n\nbig fish,\" for several reasons.  We find none of them convincing.\n\nFirst, the  judge worried  that the  big  hook/big fish  approach\n\nwould remove any outer limit  on \"the quantity of drugs that  the\n\ngovernment can introduce to  society.\"  Santana, 808 F.  Supp. at\n                                               \n\n                                14\n\n83.   It is a sufficient  answer to this concern  that, here, the\n\nsize of the sample was proportionate both to the perceived threat\n\nposed by the ongoing  criminal activity and to the  exigencies of\n\nthe chase.  Other cases, involving greater quantities of drugs or\n\nmaterially different  circumstances, need not  be decided  unless\n\nand until they arise.\n\n          Second,  the judge  concluded  that  \"the  government's\n\nconduct served  only  to increase  the  aggregate sum  of  heroin\n\navailable for consumption.\"  Id. at 84.  This statement, which we\n                                \n\nread as  a bid to repudiate the  magistrate's implicit assessment\n\nof  costs and benefits, is  highly questionable.   Let us compare\n\ntwo  worlds.  In the first world, the government distributes 13.3\n\ngrams  of heroin, but Santana's  network is put  out of business.\n\nIn the  second world, the government  exercises greater restraint\n\nin its undercover activities, but fails to gather enough evidence\n\nto immobilize the  ring.  The aggregate supply of  heroin will be\n\ngreater in the first world only if one is prepared to indulge the\n\nunlikely assumption  that  some other  equally  skilled  criminal\n\nnetwork will instantaneously pick up the slack.\n\n          Third,  the judge,  without  saying so  in haec  verba,\n                                                                \n\nseemingly  suggests that  some situations  cannot be  analyzed in\n\nterms of societal costs and benefits.

He maintains that no  possible prosecutorial objective\n\ncan justify the distribution of so much heroin by the government.\n\nBut, since there is abundant precedent for distribution of  drugs\n\nby law  enforcement agents  mounting stings and  other undercover\n\noperations,  see cases cited supra  pp. 9-10, the  only course of\n                                  \n\naction compatible with Fuentes's argument would be to construct a\n\nper se rule, drawing a bright line at some particular quantity of\n      \n\ndrugs  and forbidding lawmen to  cross that line  in dealing with\n\nsuspected  drug traffickers.   We regard  a per  se rule  in this\n                                                   \n\n                                16\n\ncontext  as unprecedented,  unworkable,10 unwise,  and thoroughly\n\nuninviting.  We, therefore, refuse to travel that road.\n\n          Saying that we  reject the district court's  objections\n\nto the big  hook/big fish  metaphor is not  tantamount to  saying\n\nthat we unreservedly embrace the comparison.   A hook, regardless\n\nof its size, causes injury  only to the fish that is caught.   We\n\nthink that a more useful metaphor is that it takes a wide  net to\n\ncatch a  big fish.   Of course, a  net cast to  catch a  big fish\n\n(thought to be predatory) might also catch hundreds of relatively\n\ninnocent little fish.  But, if  the big fish would have  devoured\n\nmillions  of little  fish,  even the  most tender-hearted  marine\n\nbiologist would be hard pressed to argue against  the fisherman's\n\nuse of the net.   In the final analysis, probing the magistrate's\n\nmetaphor for imprecisions does  not assist appellees' cause, but,\n\nrather, reinforces  our conviction that the  intuition underlying\n\nthe metaphor is sound.\n\n          We  have trolled enough  in these waters.   We conclude\n\nthat, on  the facts  of this  case, the district  court erred  in\n\ndiscounting the import of the criminal enterprise's scope and the\n\nmagnitude  of the  threat that  it posed.   This  error possesses\n\ndecretory  significance:  once the size of the sample is measured\n\nin  relative  rather  than   absolute  terms,  the  investigation\n\n                    \n\n     10We illustrate one of  the many problems that such a per se\n                                                                 \nrule would  present.  Were  we to draw  such a  line at, say,  10\ngrams of heroin, we would be handing criminals a foolproof way to\ndetect whether prospective new suppliers were actually government\nagents:    simply demand  a sample  equal to  11  or 12  grams of\nheroin.\n\n                                17\n\nreviewed  here  is no  longer  unprecedented and  the  conduct in\n\nquestion cannot plausibly be classified as outrageous.11\n\n             B.  Misconduct Not Injuring Defendants.\n                                                   \n\n          Generally  speaking,  an outrageous  misconduct defense\n\ncan  prosper only if a  defendant's due process  rights have been\n                                   \n\nviolated.   The defense is  normally not available  in situations\n\nwhere the government has injured only  third parties or committed\n\na victimless gaffe.  We would  be compelled to reverse the ruling\n\nbelow on  this basis even  if the government's  deportment failed\n\nthe test of outrageousness.\n\n          In  an early entrapment  case, Justice  Brandeis wrote:\n\n\"The prosecution  should be stopped,  not because  some right  of\n\nth[e] defendant's] has been  denied, but in order to  protect the\n\nGovernment.  To preserve it from illegal conduct of its officers.\n\nTo  protect the purity of  its courts.\"   Casey v. United States,\n                                                                \n\n276  U.S.  413,  425 (Brandeis,  J.,  dissenting).   The  obvious\n\nimplication of this perspective    with its emphasis on  the rule\n\nof law rather than on individual rights   is that the state ought\n\nnot  profit by  its miscreancy, regardless  of whether  a charged\n\ndefendant  has been  wronged.   Although  the  doctrinal view  of\n\nentrapment based on this philosophy never prevailed, see Russell,\n                                                                \n\n411 U.S. at  428-36, the Second Circuit subsequently flirted with\n\nthe  same perspective in a  different context.   In an outrageous\n\n                    \n\n     11We do not totally reject the possibility, suggested by the\ncourt below, that outrageous  misconduct may be found  apart from\nsituations in which the government has used brutality  or induced\ncommission of a crime.  We simply note that the case at hand does\nnot require us to explore this doctrinal frontier.\n\n                                18\n\nmisconduct  case   decided  on  other  grounds,   Judge  Friendly\n\nexpressed tentative support,  in the abstract, for  the view that\n\nthe government  ought not reap prosecutorial  success growing out\n\nof  the seeds of misconduct  injuring third parties.

We do not agree.\n       \n\n          In our  estimation, the  Archer dictum  is incompatible\n                                         \n\nwith later  pronouncements of  the Supreme  Court.   The flagship\n\ncase is United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727 (1979).  There, the\n                               \n\ngovernment  obtained evidence  against a  defendant by  rifling a\n\nthird  party's briefcase.    Although no  due  process claim  was\n\npresented on appeal, the Court seized the occasion to address the\n\nprecise question of misconduct injuring third parties and adopted\n\na distinction first endorsed by the Hampton plurality:\n                                           \n\n          [E]ven  if  we   assume  that  the   unlawful\n          briefcase  search  was  so outrageous  as  to\n          offend  fundamental  \"`canons of  decency and\n          fairness,'\"  Rochin  v.

Chin, 934 F.2d  393, 400 (2d  Cir. 1991).   But neither panel\n        \nactually  applied  this principle,  because  no  injury to  third\nparties had been established.  By like token, in United States v.\n                                                              \nPanet-Collazo,  960 F.2d 256 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S.

This statement, to be sure,\n      \n\nis dictum    but it  bears the earmarks  of deliberative  thought\n\npurposefully  expressed.   The statement  is clear,  pointed, and\n\nsubscribed to  by a  6-3 majority  of the Justices.   It  is also\n\nprominent  in  its  placement,  appearing,  as it  does,  in  the\n\nconcluding footnote of a major opinion.   What is more, the issue\n\nthat  footnote 9  addressed had  been thoroughly  debated in  the\n\nrecent  past,  the Payner  dissent  treated it  as  purporting to\n                         \n\nestablish a \"standing\" limitation, see id. at 749 n.15 (Marshall,\n                                          \n\nJ., dissenting), and the footnote's message has not  been diluted\n\nby any subsequent pronouncement.

SUPERVISORY POWER\n\n          The district court grounded its dismissal of count 3 on\n\nits supervisory  power as well as on the due process clause.  See\n                                                                 \n\nSantana, 808 F. Supp. at 86.  In a reprise of an argument earlier\n       \n\nadvanced, see supra  Part III(B), the  government asserts that  a\n                   \n\nfederal court's  supervisory  power does  not enable  it to  curb\n\nmisconduct that injures only  third parties by dismissing charges\n\nagainst uninjured defendants.  We test this assertion.\n\n          The  contours of  a court's  supervisory power  are not\n\n                                21\n\nmuch in doubt.  Under them, a federal court \"may, within  limits,\n\nformulate  procedural  rules  not specifically  required  by  the\n\nConstitution or  the Congress.\"   United States  v. Hasting,  461\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 499, 505 (1983).  The Hasting Court flagged three underlying\n                                  \n\npurposes  that  can  justify  the  use  of supervisory  power  in\n\nresponse  to  case-related misconduct,  viz.:    \"to implement  a\n                                            \n\nremedy for  violation of recognized rights;  to preserve judicial\n\nintegrity  by ensuring  that  a conviction  rests on  appropriate\n\nconsiderations validly before the jury;  and finally, as a remedy\n\ndesigned  to deter  illegal conduct.\"   Id.  (citations omitted).\n                                           \n\nWhile we have expressed the view that courts should be willing to\n\n\"consider   invoking  [their]   supervisory   powers  to   secure\n\nenforcement  of `better  prosecutorial practice and  reprimand of\n\nthose who fail to observe it,'\" United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n753, 763 (1st Cir.  1991) (citation omitted), we have  repeatedly\n\ncautioned that such  powers must  be used  sparingly, see,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nid.; United  States v.

Potent elixirs should not be\n            \n\ncasually dispensed.\n\n          We  do not believe that the  circumstances of this case\n\nwarrant  such  strong medicine.    Although resort  to  a court's\n\nsupervisory power has not been  foreclosed altogether as a  means\n\nto remedy  government misconduct not injuring  the defendant, the\n\nSupreme Court  has plainly  semaphored its likely  disapproval in\n\nseveral  analogous  contexts.    For example,  the  Payner  Court\n                                                          \n\n                                22\n\nconcluded  that  \"the  supervisory  power does  not  authorize  a\n\nfederal court  to suppress  otherwise admissible evidence  on the\n\nground  that  it was  seized unlawfully  from  a third  party not\n\nbefore the  court.\"  Payner, 447  U.S. at 735.   In reaching this\n                           \n\nconclusion, the Court emphasized that such evidence  could not be\n\nsuppressed under the Fourth Amendment, see Rakas v. Illinois, 439\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  128,  133-38 (1978),  and reasoned  that the  lower court's\n\nchoice of a different analytic framework did nothing to alter the\n\nrelative values  assigned to  the underlying interests.   Payner,\n                                                                \n\n447 U.S. at 736.  The lesson that this portion  of Payner teaches\n                                                         \n\nis  that,  in  a  case-specific context,  society's  interest  in\n\nadjudicating guilt  and innocence on  full information  outweighs\n\nits   interest  in  punishing  governmental  misconduct  directed\n\nagainst third parties.\n\n          The Court subsequently held  that the supervisory power\n\ncould  not be  invoked  to  reverse  a  conviction  in  order  to\n\ncastigate the  prosecution for misconduct that  did not prejudice\n\n(as  opposed to injure) the  defendant.13  See  Hasting, 461 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat 505.  Because the prosecutor's actions in Hasting  constituted\n                                                    \n\nharmless error vis-a-vis the defendant, see id. at 507, no relief\n                                               \n\nwas warranted.   The holding  of Hasting  replicates the  message\n                                        \n\n                    \n\n     13Misconduct  not  injuring the  defendant  is  a subset  of\nharmless error (which itself might be described as misconduct not\nprejudicing the defendant).  For our purposes, the two categories\nmay be fruitfully analyzed  as one.  The only  salient difference\nbetween  them is that the larger set subsumes not only misconduct\nthat injures  third persons  and victimless misconduct,  but also\nsubsumes misconduct  that violates a  defendant's rights  without\naffecting the outcome of his case.\n\n                                23\n\nsent by Payner, but it does so a fortiori:  if society's interest\n                                         \n\nin  fully  informed  adjudication   sometimes  can  outweigh  its\n\ninterest in protecting the  Fifth Amendment rights of defendants,\n                                                                \n\nthen surely  it can outweigh society's  more generalized interest\n\nin making law enforcement officers toe the line.\n\n          The reasoning of the Hasting Court is also instructive.\n                                      \n\nAs  in Payner,  the Court  in Hasting  reasoned that  when courts\n                                     \n\nexercise  the supervisory power, they must respect the balance of\n\ninterests  struck  by  conventional   application  of  the  legal\n\ndoctrines  governing  the particular  problem  in  the particular\n\ncase.

Furthermore, the Hasting Court identified\n                                                \n\nthree  justifications,   or  goals,  in  service   of  which  the\n\nsupervisory power might appropriately be invoked, see id. at 506-\n                                                         \n\n07; see also supra  p. 21, and rested  its holding in part on  an\n                  \n\nanalysis of them.   The Court concluded that none  of these three\n\ngoals are significantly advanced  when the error that  is alleged\n\nto  constitute  misconduct  proves  harmless, for  concerns  over\n\nindividual rights and  the integrity of the  judicial process are\n\nless acute in  all such cases.  See id. at 506.  The Court stated\n                                       \n\nthat the  third doctrinal goal    the deterrence  of misconduct14\n\n   \"is  an inappropriate  basis  for  reversal where  .  . .  the\n\nprosecutor's  remark  is  at  most  an  attenuated  violation  of\n\n[defendant's  right  to  remain  silent]  and  where  means  more\n\n                    \n\n     14We highlight this goal because it not only constitutes the\nlinchpin  of the  district  court's rationale  for employing  the\nsupervisory power in this  case, but also serves as  the mainstay\nof  the supporting arguments advanced by the appellees and by the\namici.\n\n                                24\n\nnarrowly  tailored to  deter objectionable  prosecutorial conduct\n\nare available.\"  Id.\n                    \n\n          Another  case  delineating  limits on  the  supervisory\n\npower is  Bank of  Nova Scotia  v.

In reaching this conclusion, the  Court adverted to\n   \n\nPayner's point that  value choices dictated by  the resolution of\n      \n\nthe underlying legal problem should not be affected by the source\n\nfrom which an inquiring court  draws its power.  See id.  at 255.\n                                                        \n\nThe Court also reaffirmed Hasting's point that the rationales for\n                                 \n\ninvoking supervisory power  are much weaker in the harmless error\n\ncontext.15  See id. at 255-56.\n                   \n\n          In  keeping with  the Supreme  Court's teachings,  this\n\ncourt  has  repeatedly  refused  to sanction  the  deployment  of\n\nsupervisory  power  in order  to  redress  harmless  error.

We  think this  line of cases  adequately\n\nevinces our institutional  belief that,  taken together,  Payner,\n                                                                \n\nHasting,  and  Bank of  Nova  Scotia form  a  trilogy admonishing\n                                    \n\nfederal  courts to refrain  from using  the supervisory  power to\n\nconform  executive  conduct  to  judicially  preferred  norms  by\n\ndismissing charges, absent cognizable  prejudice to a  particular\n\ndefendant.16   Accord United  States v. Williams,  874 F.2d  968,\n                                                \n\n976  n.23  (5th  Cir.  1989).     Here,  appellees  sustained  no\n\nredressable  injury  attributable  to   governmental  misconduct.\n\nAccordingly, the district court erred as a  matter of law when it\n\ninvoked supervisory power to dismiss count 3 of the indictment.\n\n          Before  departing from these shores,  we pause to add a\n\nqualification:    the  use  of supervisory  power  to  dismiss an\n\nindictment, in the absence of injury to the defendant, may not be\n\nentirely a dead letter.  The  Court's reasoning in Hasting may be\n                                                          \n\nread to leave  open the  possibility that the  goal of  deterring\n\nfuture misconduct  would justify  using the supervisory  power to\n\nredress conduct not injuring defendants if the conduct is plainly\n\nimproper,  indisputably outrageous,  and not  redressable through\n\nthe utilization of less drastic disciplinary tools.  See Hasting,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     16The  Second Circuit  has  gone even  further, reading  the\nSupreme Court's  cases to  suggest that \"the  federal judiciary's\nsupervisory powers over prosecutorial activities  that take place\noutside  the courthouse  is extremely  limited, if  it exists  at\nall.\"   United  States v.  Lau Tung  Lam, 714  F.2d 209,  210 (2d\n                                        \nCir.), cert. denied,  464 U.S. 942  (1983).  Because the  case at\n                   \nbar  does not  require that  we probe  the ramifications  of this\nsuggestion, we take no view of it.\n\n                                26\n\n461 U.S. at 506.  Be that as it may, we leave the qualification's\n\nfate and dimensions for  another day, as this is plainly not such\n\na case.\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          In  summary,   the   orphan  doctrine   of   outrageous\n\nmisconduct  finds no  nurturing home  on the  facts of  this case\n\nbecause  the objects  of the  government's  ongoing investigation\n\nsatisfactorily justified whatever harm  stemmed from the delivery\n\n(and subsequent loss) of  a large heroin sample, and  because, in\n\nany  event,   that  harm  was  not  incurred   by  the  appellees\n\nthemselves.     In   like   manner,  because   the  trial   court\n\noverestimated  the reach  of  its supervisory  power in  cases of\n\nmisconduct  not  injuring defendants,  its  alternative rationale\n\ncrumbles.  If there are  exceptions to the general rules that  we\n\nhave  elucidated   a matter  on which we do not  opine   they are\n\nassuredly not triggered by this case.   Hence, the court lacked a\n\nsufficient legal basis for dismissing count 3 of the indictment.\n\n          We  need go  no further.   Although  the effect  of our\n\nruling is to  uphold the  government's tactics in  this case,  we\n\nremain   secure  in  the  knowledge  that,  despite  restrictions\n\nhobbling  the  outrageous  misconduct doctrine,  law  enforcement\n\npractices are subject to a wide range of specific \"constitutional\n\nand statutory  limitations and  to judicially fashioned  rules to\n\nenforce  those  limitations.\"   Russell,  411  U.S.  at  435; cf.\n                                                                 \n\nHasting, 461 U.S. at 506 n.5 (illustrating more narrowly tailored\n       \n\nmeans  to  punish  prosecutorial  misconduct).    Moreover,   the\n\n                                27\n\noutrageous  misconduct  doctrine,  no   matter  how  cramped  its\n\nconfines, is not entirely mummified.  Should the occasion and the\n\nnecessity arise, we continue  to believe that the law  will prove\n\nitself adequate  to the  task of  preventing the government  from\n\ngoing too  far.  In the war on crime, as in conventional warfare,\n\nsome tactics simply cannot be tolerated by a civilized society.\n\n          Reversed.\n                  \n\n                                28\n",

Consequently, we reverse.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          In  1991, the  federal Drug  Enforcement Administration\n\n(DEA)  mounted an  elaborate reverse  sting  designed to  bring a\n\nmammoth heroin distribution network to  ground.  The DEA believed\n\nthat defendant-appellee  Rafael Santana ran the  ring from prison\n\nthrough  various  henchmen, including  defendant-appellee Francis\n\nFuentes.  In the course of the sting, Fuentes asked an undercover\n\nagent, posing as  a heroin supplier, to  furnish a sample of  his\n\nwares.    The  agent  received a  special  dispensation  from DEA\n\nhierarchs  and  delivered  13.3 grams  of  heroin,  92%  pure, to\n\n                                2\n\nFuentes  in August of 1991.1  The authorities never recovered the\n\nsample.\n\n          There is a factual dispute over the size of the stakes.\n\nThe  government, based on its  agent's testimony, claims that the\n\ndeal under negotiation contemplated  delivery of 141 kilograms of\n\nheroin.   It further claims, based on an informer's account, that\n\nSantana's  organization was  capable  of distributing  up to  200\n\nkilograms  of  heroin  monthly.     Appellees  suggest  that  the\n\nnegotiations  concerned   a  considerably  smaller   quantity  of\n\nnarcotics, and that the  organization, if it existed at  all, was\n\nfar less ambitious.  We need not  enter this thicket; for present\n\npurposes, the relevant finding is the reasonableness, at the time\n\nthe sample  was furnished,  of the  government's belief that  the\n\nalleged  organization  had  the  capacity  to  manage  widespread\n\ndistribution  of heroin.  It  is not seriously  disputed that the\n\ngovernment  thought  this  to be  the  case;  and, moreover,  the\n\ngovernment's  belief, given both the information in its files and\n\nSantana's history   he  had been convicted in 1990  of conspiracy\n\nto  smuggle   1,000  kilograms   of  heroin      was  objectively\n\nreasonable.\n\n          Having been made privy to the evidence collected in the\n\ncourse  of  the government's  indagation,  a  federal grand  jury\n\n                    \n\n     1The heroin sample comprises  about 2,500 doses of the  size\nand purity  typically sold on the street.

We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.   3731 (1988).\n\n          There  are two main legal points in contention.  First,\n\n                    \n\n     2Count  3 named only Santana  and Fuentes.   Hence, they are\nthe lone appellees.\n\n     3The briefs  highlight several  other factual disputes.   By\nand  large,  these  disputes hinge  on  the  admissibility of  an\naffidavit appended  to the motion  to reconsider    an  affidavit\nwhich  tries to shed  light on the  sample's ultimate disposition\nand  the agent's motive in delivering it.  Because this affidavit\nwas not proffered originally, and because the lower court made no\nfindings concerning it, we  consider only two undisputed portions\nof the affidavit, namely, that the agent, in asking his superiors\nto  arrange for  a  sample, believed  that  \"Fuentes was  testing\nwhether I was a real drug  dealer,\" and that supplying the sample\n\"was  an  important part  of  Fuentes' evaluation  whether  to go\nforward  with the deal.\"   We will assume,  as appellees implore,\nthat most,  if not all, of  the 13.3 grams of  heroin reached end\nusers.\n\n                                4\n\nthe government  denies that its conduct was  outrageous.  Second,\n\nthe  government  asseverates  that   the  district  court  lacked\n\nauthority  under either the due  process clause or  the rubric of\n\nsupervisory  power  to  redress  injuries  to  third  parties  by\n                                                             \n\ndismissing charges against appellees.

Almost by definition, the power of a court\n\nto control prosecutorial excesses  through resort to  substantive\n\naspects of  the due process  clause is  called into play  only in\n\nidiosyncratic situations    and such situations are  likely to be\n\nhighly ramified.   Where facts are critically  important and fact\n\npatterns tend  to be  infinitely diverse, adjudication  can often\n\nbest proceed on a case-by-case basis.  The outrageousness defense\n\nfalls into this category.   Thus, it is unproductive to force the\n\ndetermination of outrageousness into a mechanical mode.\n\n          Let   us   be   perfectly   plain.     We   find   that\n\noutrageousness, by its nature,  requires an ad hoc determination.\n                                                  \n\nWe  do not suggest, however, that the assessment should be wholly\n\nunguided.  The calculus must be rooted in the record, and it will\n\noften  be informed  by  the  various  factors enumerated  in  the\n\ndistrict  court's test,  the DEA's  test, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span>  supra </span><pre class=\"inline\">note  8, and\n                                                    \n\n                    \n\nreach consumers;  (3) the number  and prominence of  the suspects\nimplicated;  (4)  the  type  and  amount  of evidence  needed  to\ncomplete the  ongoing investigation; (5) the time  required to do\nso;  and (6) the likelihood of obtaining such evidence.  Although\nthe DEA's list, like the  district court's list, contains factors\nrelevant to the seriousness of harm likely to  be suffered by end\nusers,  the DEA's list emphasizes, and  the court's list slights,\nthe  likelihood   that  the   investigation  will  lead   to  the\nprosecution of important drug dealers.\n\n                                12\n\nsimilar tests produced  by other sources.9   At bottom,  however,\n\noutrageousness is a  concept, not  a constant.   What shocks  the\n\nconscience in a given situation may be acceptable, though perhaps\n\ngrim  or  unpleasant, under  a  different  set of  circumstances.\n\nSlashing  a  person's  throat  with  a  sharp  knife  may  be  an\n\nunrelievedly outrageous  course of conduct if one thinks in terms\n\nof  Jack the Ripper, helpless  women, and the  shadowy streets of\n\nLondon; the same behavior will be thoroughly acceptable, however,\n\nif  the knife is a  scalpel, the knife-wielder  a skilled surgeon\n\nperforming  a tracheotomy, the target a patient, and the venue an\n\noperating room.  Although we recognize that formulaic tests offer\n\nadministrative  convenience  and  ease  in  application,  we also\n\nrecognize that neither life nor law can always be made convenient\n\nand easy.  So here:   there is simply no way to reduce the myriad\n\ncombinations of potentially relevant circumstances to a neat list\n\nof weighted factors without  losing too much in  the translation.\n\nCf.

It is a sufficient  answer to this concern  that, here, the\n\nsize of the sample was proportionate both to the perceived threat\n\nposed by the ongoing  criminal activity and to the  exigencies of\n\nthe chase.  Other cases, involving greater quantities of drugs or\n\nmaterially different  circumstances, need not  be decided  unless\n\nand until they arise.\n\n          Second,  the judge  concluded  that  \"the  government's\n\nconduct served  only  to increase  the  aggregate sum  of  heroin\n\navailable for consumption.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 84. </span><pre class=\"inline\"> This statement, which we\n                                \n\nread as  a bid to repudiate the  magistrate's implicit assessment\n\nof  costs and benefits, is  highly questionable.   Let us compare\n\ntwo  worlds.

At least when\n\nthe decisionmaker uses a common currency of exchange and operates\n\nunder  conditions of reasonable  certainty, cost/benefit analysis\n\nis  a perfectly  legitimate mode  of legal  reasoning, frequently\n\nemployed by both courts  and agencies.

Using such\n                                      \n\nan  approach here  does  not strike  us  as either  theoretically\n\nunsound or fundamentally  unfair.  More  important still, we  can\n\nidentify no constitutional impediment to the  government weighing\n\nthe  risk of an immediate 13.3-gram increase in the heroin supply\n\nagainst  the potential  benefit of  diverting vast  quantities of\n\nheroin from the American market.\n\n          The   district   court's  resistance   to  cost/benefit\n\nanalysis  is  carried  to  its  logical  conclusion  by  appellee\n\nFuentes.   He maintains that no  possible prosecutorial objective\n\ncan justify the distribution of so much heroin by the government.\n\nBut, since there is abundant precedent for distribution of  drugs\n\nby law  enforcement agents  mounting stings and  other undercover\n\noperations,  see cases cited supra  pp. 9-10, the  only course of\n                                  \n\naction compatible with Fuentes's argument would be to construct a\n\nper se rule, drawing a bright line at some particular quantity of\n      \n\ndrugs  and forbidding lawmen to  cross that line  in dealing with\n\nsuspected  drug traffickers.   We regard  a per  se rule  in this\n                                                   \n\n                                16\n\ncontext  as unprecedented,  unworkable,10 unwise,  and thoroughly\n\nuninviting.  We, therefore, refuse to travel that road.\n\n          Saying that we  reject the district court's  objections\n\nto the big  hook/big fish  metaphor is not  tantamount to  saying\n\nthat we unreservedly embrace the comparison.   A hook, regardless\n\nof its size, causes injury  only to the fish that is caught.   We\n\nthink that a more useful metaphor is that it takes a wide  net to\n\ncatch a  big fish.   Of course, a  net cast to  catch a  big fish\n\n(thought to be predatory) might also catch hundreds of relatively\n\ninnocent little fish.  But, if  the big fish would have  devoured\n\nmillions  of little  fish,  even the  most tender-hearted  marine\n\nbiologist would be hard pressed to argue against  the fisherman's\n\nuse of the net.   In the final analysis, probing the magistrate's\n\nmetaphor for imprecisions does  not assist appellees' cause, but,\n\nrather, reinforces  our conviction that the  intuition underlying\n\nthe metaphor is sound.\n\n          We  have trolled enough  in these waters.   We conclude\n\nthat, on  the facts  of this  case, the district  court erred  in\n\ndiscounting the import of the criminal enterprise's scope and the\n\nmagnitude  of the  threat that  it posed.   This  error possesses\n\ndecretory  significance:  once the size of the sample is measured\n\nin  relative  rather  than   absolute  terms,  the  investigation\n\n                    \n\n     10We illustrate one of  the many problems that such a per se\n                                                                 \nrule would  present.  Were  we to draw  such a  line at, say,  10\ngrams of heroin, we would be handing criminals a foolproof way to\ndetect whether prospective new suppliers were actually government\nagents:    simply demand  a sample  equal to  11  or 12  grams of\nheroin.\n\n                                17\n\nreviewed  here  is no  longer  unprecedented and  the  conduct in\n\nquestion cannot plausibly be classified as outrageous.11\n\n             B.  Misconduct Not Injuring Defendants.\n                                                   \n\n          Generally  speaking,  an outrageous  misconduct defense\n\ncan  prosper only if a  defendant's due process  rights have been\n                                   \n\nviolated.   The defense is  normally not available  in situations\n\nwhere the government has injured only  third parties or committed\n\na victimless gaffe.  We would  be compelled to reverse the ruling\n\nbelow on  this basis even  if the government's  deportment failed\n\nthe test of outrageousness.\n\n          In  an early entrapment  case, Justice  Brandeis wrote:\n\n\"The prosecution  should be stopped,  not because  some right  of\n\nth[e] defendant's] has been  denied, but in order to  protect the\n\nGovernment.

The only  salient difference\nbetween  them is that the larger set subsumes not only misconduct\nthat injures  third persons  and victimless misconduct,  but also\nsubsumes misconduct  that violates a  defendant's rights  without\naffecting the outcome of his case.\n\n                                23\n\nsent by Payner, but it does so a fortiori:  if society's interest\n                                         \n\nin  fully  informed  adjudication   sometimes  can  outweigh  its\n\ninterest in protecting the  Fifth Amendment rights of defendants,\n                                                                \n\nthen surely  it can outweigh society's  more generalized interest\n\nin making law enforcement officers toe the line.\n\n          The reasoning of the Hasting Court is also instructive.\n                                      \n\nAs  in Payner,  the Court  in Hasting  reasoned that  when courts\n                                     \n\nexercise  the supervisory power, they must respect the balance of\n\ninterests  struck  by  conventional   application  of  the  legal\n\ndoctrines  governing  the particular  problem  in  the particular\n\ncase.

CONCLUSION\n\n          In  summary,   the   orphan  doctrine   of   outrageous\n\nmisconduct  finds no  nurturing home  on the  facts of  this case\n\nbecause  the objects  of the  government's  ongoing investigation\n\nsatisfactorily justified whatever harm  stemmed from the delivery\n\n(and subsequent loss) of  a large heroin sample, and  because, in\n\nany  event,   that  harm  was  not  incurred   by  the  appellees\n\nthemselves.     In   like   manner,  because   the  trial   court\n\noverestimated  the reach  of  its supervisory  power in  cases of\n\nmisconduct  not  injuring defendants,  its  alternative rationale\n\ncrumbles.  If there are  exceptions to the general rules that  we\n\nhave  elucidated   a matter  on which we do not  opine   they are\n\nassuredly not triggered by this case.   Hence, the court lacked a\n\nsufficient legal basis for dismissing count 3 of the indictment.\n\n          We  need go  no further.   Although  the effect  of our\n\nruling is to  uphold the  government's tactics in  this case,  we\n\nremain   secure  in  the  knowledge  that,  despite  restrictions\n\nhobbling  the  outrageous  misconduct doctrine,  law  enforcement\n\npractices are subject to a wide range of specific \"constitutional\n\nand statutory  limitations and  to judicially fashioned  rules to\n\nenforce  those  limitations.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Russell,</span>  <span class=\"volume\">411</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  at  <span class=\"page\">435</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; cf.\n                                                                 \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hasting,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">506</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">n.5 (illustrating more narrowly tailored\n       \n\nmeans  to  punish  prosecutorial  misconduct).
