Champlin on brief pro se.\r                                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   Attorney John  Hallisey appeals  from\r                                \r\n\nthe  district  court's  dismissal  of his  motion  for  civil\r\n\ncontempt.    Hallisey claims  that  his  former clients,  the\r\n\nChamplins, should be held in contempt for not complying  with\r\n\na fee settlement that was approved and signed by the district\r\n\ncourt in a case that has been closed.\r\n\n          Hallisey  characterizes the  alleged breach  of the\r\n\nfee settlement as a \"refusal  to obey [the district  court's]\r\n\njudgment.\"   The term \"judgment,\" however,  begs the question\r\n\nof  subject matter  jurisdiction:   absent  some  independent\r\n\nbasis    for   federal    jurisdiction,   dismissal-producing\r\n\nsettlement agreements  are not  enforceable in federal  court\r\n\nunless  the   district  court  has  ensured   its  continuing\r\n\nancillary jurisdiction by making  \"the parties' obligation to\r\n\ncomply with the settlement agreement . . . part of  the order\r\n\nof dismissal.\"   See Kokkonen  v. Guardian Life  Ins. Co.  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nAm.,  114 S. Ct.  1673, 1677 (1994).   We are  unable to tell\r               \r\n\nfrom the  record presented to  us whether the  district court\r\n\npreserved its  ancillary jurisdiction in this matter, \"either\r\n\nby  separate  provision  (such   as  a  provision  `retaining\r\n\njurisdiction'   over   the   settlement  agreement)   or   by\r\n\nincorporating the  terms of  the settlement agreement  in the\r\n\norder.\"  Id.\r                        \r\n\n          In any  event, because the  merits of the  case are\r\n\neasily resolved  in favor  of the  parties who would  benefit\r\r\n\nfrom an objection  to jurisdiction, we  need not resolve  the\r\n\njurisdictional  issue.

Trustees of  Tufts\r                                                                         \r\n\nCollege,  613  F.2d  1200,  1202 (1st  Cir.  1980)  (assuming\r                   \r\n\ndistrict court had  subject matter jurisdiction  to entertain\r\n\nmotion for a preliminary  injunction; upholding the denial of\r\n\nthe  motion).    The  complainant in  a  contempt  proceeding\r\n\ncarries  the \"heavy burden\" of  proving contempt by clear and\r\n\nconvincing  evidence.   Langton v.  Johnston, 928  F.2d 1206,\r                                                        \r\n\n1220-22 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing AMF, Inc. v. Jewett, 711 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1096,  1100 (1st  Cir. 1983)).   The denial  of a  motion for\r\n\ncontempt  is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.  Langton,\r                                                                        \r\n\n928  F.2d at  1220.   See  also  AMF, 711  F.2d  at 1100  (\"a\r                                                \r\n\ndistrict  court's  refusal to  find  contempt  should not  be\r\n\noverturned lightly\").1\r\n\n          The  district   court  dismissed  the   motion  for\r\n\ncontempt because \"[n]o factual basis\" had been proffered.  We\r\n\nthink  it meant  that Hallisey's  allegations, even  if true,\r\n\nfell  short of  clear  and convincing  evidence of  contempt.\r\n\nThere was no abuse of discretion in this determination.\r\n\n          Hallisey  argues that  the district  court deprived\r\n\nhim  of due process by dismissing the motion for contempt sua\r                                                                         \r\n\nsponte  while  his discovery  requests were  pending, without\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In the section of his brief setting forth our standard of\r\nreview,  Hallisey says  that  we review  questions of  law de\r                                                                         \r\nnovo,  but  fails to  follow up  this  truism with  the well-\r                \r\nsettled standard of review in denial of contempt cases.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ngiving  him an opportunity to plead the factual basis for his\r\n\nclaims.   We think that Hallisey had an adequate opportunity,\r\n\nif not in his  motion for contempt, certainly in  his related\r\n\nmotion for summary judgment, to present the factual basis for\r\n\nhis  claims.  The district court did not abuse its discretion\r\n\nby denying the motion for contempt.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
