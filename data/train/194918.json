Defendant  contends  that the  government\r                            \n\nknowingly  permitted its main  witness, Tina Pina,  to commit\n\nperjury.  We  conclude defendant has not  established perjury\n\nand affirm his conviction.\n\n     First, defendant claims  Tina perjured herself  when she\n\ntestified that  \"being handcuffed  and charged with  unlawful\n\ncarrying a  firearm\" was \"all  new to [her].\"   The statement\n\nwas  perjurious,  according  to  defendant,  because  it  was\n\ntantamount to an assertion  that she had never  been arrested\n\nbefore,  when,  in  fact, she  had  previously  faced several\n\ncharges  in her  life.   Defendant  reads too  much into  the\n\nstatement.   Tina  did not  assert  that she  had never  been\n\narrested.   Moreover, even if  Tina had been arrested  in the\n\npast, being handcuffed and charged with unlawfully carrying a\n\nfirearm  in the manner described  at trial could well qualify\n\nas \"new\" to her.  Defendant has not shown perjury.\n\n     Second, defendant  contends Tina  perjured herself  when\n\nshe testified  that it was defendant who handed her a gun and\n\ntold her to  stash the gun in  her pants.  Perjury  is shown,\n\ndefendant  claims, by the fact that Tina, interviewed several\n\ndays after arrest by Agent  Offringa, did not then tell Agent\n\nOffringa that defendant  was the one who had  directed her to\n\nstash the gun  and by alleged statements in  two reports that\n\nshe did not know who had handed her the gun.\n\n     Again,  defendant has not shown perjury.  Agent Offringa\n\n                             -2-\r\n\nacknowledged at trial  that his report of his  interview with\n\nTina several days after arrest  did not identify defendant as\n\nthe one who had  given her the gun  and had told her to  hide\n\nit.   Agent Offringa  testified, however, that  in subsequent\n\ninterviews  Tina consistently  claimed defendant was  the one\n\nwho had directed her and that she had never  said anyone else\n\nhad handed  her the gun.1   As for the  alleged statements in\n\ntwo reports  that Tina had claimed  she did not know  who had\n\nhanded  her  the gun,  the reports  were not  introduced into\n\nevidence.    Consequently,  there is  no  record  support for\n\ndefendant's claim  that Tina told  officers she did  now know\n\nwho  handed her  the gun.    We will  not consider  on appeal\n\nevidence or  arguments which have  not been presented  to the\n\ntrial court.  In any event, however, the  fact that a witness\n\ncontradicts herself or  changes her story does  not establish\n\nperjury.   See,  e.g., Tapia  v. Tansy,  926 F.2d  1554, 1563\r                                                  \n\n(10th  Cir.)  (\"Contradictions  and  changes  in a  witness's\n\ntestimony alone do not  constitute perjury and do  not create\n\nan  inference, let alone prove, that the prosecutor knowingly\n\npresented perjured testimony.\"), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 115\r                                                         \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Defendant asks this court to expand the record to include\nAgent Offringa's  report.  The  request is denied.   Although\nthe report was utilized by defense counsel in cross-examining\nAgent  Offringa, the report was not introduced into evidence.\nDefendant may not  add to the record at  the appellate level.\nIn any event, since Agent Offringa acknowledged at trial that\nhis report did not identify defendant as the one handing Tina\nthe gun,  the report itself  is not needed to  establish what\nAgent Offringa has admitted.\n\n                             -3-\r\n\n(1991).\n\n     In  accordance  with  our  obligation  under  Anders  v.\r                                                                     \n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S.  738, 744 (1967),  we have reviewed  the\r                      \n\ntrial  and sentencing  record.   We  conclude  the appeal  is\n\nwholly frivolous.  Consequently, counsel's motion to withdraw\n\nis granted.
