Defendant-appellant  Mary   Gail  Malloy\r                            \r\n\nappeals on the sole  ground that the district court  erred in\r\n\ndenying  her  motion  for  a  downward  departure  from   the\r\n\nguidelines  sentencing range  pursuant to  U.S.S.G.    5H1.4.\r\n\nThe government  argues that we lack jurisdiction and urges us\r\n\nto dismiss the appeal.  We agree with the government.  \r\n\n     The sentencing  transcript  suggests that  the  district\r\n\ncourt  may have made no final determination whether or not it\r\n\nhad the authority to  depart to a reduced prison  sentence as\r\n\nrequested by Malloy.   However, the  court clearly  concluded\r\n\nthat whether or not it  had such authority, the facts  in the\r\n\ninstant  case  do not  warrant  a downward  departure.   This\r\n\nlatter finding constitutes a discretionary refusal to depart.\r\n\nSince it  is sufficient to support the sentence, the district\r\n\ncourt's decision not to  depart is unreviewable.
