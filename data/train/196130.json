They did not  file\r\n\nstatutory liens, nor  was there  a surety bond  or any  other\r\n\ncontract for  their protection.  The  district court affirmed\r\n\nthe  bankruptcy  court's summary  judgment  in  favor of  the\r\n\ntrustee.

Defendants claimed  they had equitable liens.   The\r\n\ncourt held that, in the absence of any special contract, they\r\n\nhad  none,  and hence  the  payments  to them  were  voidable\r\n\npreferences.    Plaintiffs   here,  who   likewise  have   no\r\n\nprotection of  a surety,  and no special  contract otherwise,\r\n\ncan  escape  foreclosure of  their  equitable  claim only  by\r\n\npersuading us that Ehrlich is no longer law.\r                                      \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Plaintiffs would reach that result  by pointing out\r\n\nthat in Canter  v. Schlager,  358 Mass. 789,  267 N.E.2d  492\r                                       \r\n\n(1971), the  court recognized  subrogation rights.   There it\r\n\nheld  that   a  surety  on  a  performance   bond  that  paid\r\n\nsubcontractors has a priority  \"right of subrogation over the\r\n\nrights of a construction contractor's trustee in bankruptcy.\"\r\n\n358  Mass. at 792,  267 N.E.2d at  494.  Strictly  this meant\r\n\npriority for  the  surety who  was \"subrogated  . . . to  the\r\n\nrights  of  the subcontractors  it paid.\"    Id. at  791, 267\r                                                            \r\n\nN.E.2d   at  494.      This  differed   from  Ehrlich   where\r                                                                 \r\n\nsubcontractors were  held to  have no special  rights because\r\n\nhere there  was a  contract.   The subcontractors  had rights\r\n\nbecause  \"they  are  entitled  to  rely  on  a  payment  bond\r\n\nproviding  expressly that they may sue thereon.\"  Id. at 795,\r                                                                 \r\n\n267  N.E.2d at 496.   The court noted,  further, that, unlike\r\n\nEhrlich, the surety was  not claiming, timewise, in violation\r                   \r\n\nof the Bankruptcy Act.   \"[T]he surety's right dates  back to\r\n\nthe date  of the bond.\"   Id. at  795-96, 267 N.E.2d  at 496.\r                                         \r\n\nFor present plaintiffs, who lack a bond, and such timeliness,\r\n\nthese are fatal distinctions.\r\n\n          Since we  are concerned  with state law  choices in\r\n\nthe  treatment of  creditors,  and  not  federal law,  it  is\r\n\npointless for plaintiffs to argue that Canter's reasoning and\r                                                           \r\n\nits treatment of subcontractors' rights as depending upon the\r\n\npresence of a  surety bond was inconsistent with Ehrlich, and\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ntherefore must be taken as overruling  Ehrlich -- although it\r                                                          \r\n\nsaid it distinguished it.  Our sole duty is to take state law\r\n\nas we find it, not build on  it.  Nor would we be tempted  to\r\n\nbuild.    There  is  sound  public  policy  in  recognizing a\r\n\ndifference   when  there   is  a   surety  in   the  picture.\r\n\n\"Traditionally  sureties compelled  to  pay  debts for  their\r\n\nprincipal have  been deemed entitled to  reimbursement.\"  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nPearlman v.
