Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                       \r\n\n          Before\r\n\n  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nJohn R. Gibson, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                       \r\n\nJoseph L. Bierwirth, Jr., with whom Susan Hughes Banning  and\r\nHemenway &amp; Barnes were on brief, for appellant.\r\nJohn D. Dwyer, with whom Dwyer &amp; Dwyer was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                       \r\n\n    February 3,1999\r\n                                 JOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.  The Parish of\r\nChrist Church brought this action for a declaration that the\r\ngeneral liability insurance policy issued to it by the Church\r\nInsurance Company provided coverage for an action claiming\r\ndefamation, invasion of privacy, and discrimination in employment\r\nbrought by a former music director of the Parish.  The Parish\r\nappeals from a summary judgment entered by the district court based\r\non a policy exclusion of \"personal injury sustained by any person\r\nas a result of an offense directly or indirectly related to the\r\nemployment of such person by the named insured.\"  The Parish argues\r\nthat the district court erred in its interpretation of the\r\nexclusion in the policy and abused its discretion by denying a\r\nmotion to amend, alter, or reconsider the judgment.  We affirm.\r\nRenea Waligora was the music director at the parish. \r\nAfter Reverend James A. Diamond, the parish's pastor, dismissed\r\nWaligora from her job, Waligora filed a multi-count lawsuit in\r\nMassachusetts state court, naming the parish, Diamond, and the\r\nProtestant Diocese of Massachusetts as defendants.  Waligora\r\nalleged that Diamond discharged her because she suffered from Post-\r\nTraumatic Stress Disorder and Multiple Personality Disorder.  Among\r\nother things, the complaint contained counts of defamation,\r\ninvasion of privacy, and discrimination in employment.  The\r\nrelevant allegations of the complaint are as follows: \r\n8.  Among Waligora's responsibilities as Music\r\nDirector were . . . to lead the adult and\r\nchildren's vocal and handbell choirs.\r\n\n. . . .\r\n\n13.  On December 26, 1993 . . . . Rev. Diamond\r\n. . . fired Waligora from her position as\r\nMusic Director of the Parish . . . .   \r\n\n14.  In a letter dated December 29, 1993, a\r\nformer parishioner and member of the Parish\r\nchoir sought the intervention of the then-\r\nBishop of the Diocese . . . [but the Bishop]\r\ndid nothing to reverse Waligora's termination\r\nof employment.\r\n\n15.  [B]eginning in or about November, 1993,\r\nand thereafter, Reverend Diamond made the\r\nfollowing statements, uttered words to similar\r\neffect, and/or published to members of the\r\nparish, the following, inter alia, concerning\r\nWaligora:  \r\n\n(a) That 'Renea is very sick and disturbed and\r\nneeds to be under intense medical treatment;'\r\n\n(b) That he (Rev. Diamond) had consulted with\r\na psychiatrist whose advice indicated that the\r\nchildren should be protected from Waligora;\r\n\n(c) That after consulting a psychiatrist he\r\n(Rev. Diamond) felt he could no longer trust\r\nWaligora and was afraid to leave Waligora\r\nalone with the children;\r\n\n(d) That if others learned more about Multiple\r\nPersonality Disorder they would understand why\r\nhe (Rev. Diamond) had to fire Waligora.  \r\n\nApp. at 15-16.  The parish removed Waligora's suit to federal\r\ncourt, and after counts based on the Americans with Disabilities\r\nAct were dismissed, the case was remanded to the state court and is\r\nnow pending.\r\nThe parish carried a general liability insurance policy\r\nissued by the company providing coverage from April 1, 1993 to\r\nApril 1, 1994.  The policy indemnifies the parish for damages\r\nresulting from personal injury, including injury from defamation. \r\nThe policy further obligates the company to defend the parish in\r\nany suit seeking damages covered by the policy.  However, the\r\npolicy excludes from coverage \"personal injury sustained by any\r\nperson as a result of an offense directly or indirectly related to\r\nthe employment of such person by the Named Insured.\"  Based on the\r\npolicy exclusion, the company denied any duty to defend the suit or\r\nindemnify the parish for the costs of defending the suit.  The\r\nparish filed this action seeking a declaration of its rights under\r\nthe policy.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. \r\nBoth parties stipulated that on the motions for summary judgment\r\nthe district court need only look to the policy and Waligora's\r\ncomplaint to decide whether the exclusion applied.  The district\r\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of the company, holding\r\nthat the exclusion applied, and we affirm.\r\nThe key issue before us is whether the district court\r\nerred in holding that the exclusion applied.  We review this\r\nconclusion of law de novo.  See Mt. Airy Ins. Co. v. Greenbaum, 127\r\nF.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1997).  The question is whether Waligora's\r\nsuit was for personal injury sustained \"as a result of an offense\r\ndirectly or indirectly related to her employment\" by the parish. \r\nIf it is, then the policy exclusion applies, and the company has no\r\nduty to defend the parish against Waligora's suit.  Looking only to\r\nWaligora's complaint and the relevant language of the policy, as\r\nthe parties so agreed, we conclude the exclusion applies. \r\nThis case is similar to three others cited by the\r\ncompany.  See Interco Inc. v. Mission Ins. Co., 808 F.2d 682 (8th\r\nCir. 1987);  Frank and Freedus v. Allstate Ins. Co., 45 Cal. App.\r\n4th 461, 52 Cal.Rptr. 2d 678 (1996); Loyola Marymount Univ. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemn. Co., 219 Cal. App. 3d 1217, 271 Cal.\r\nRptr. 528 (1990).  In each of these cases, discharged employees\r\nbrought similar claims against their employer, insured by policies\r\nwith  similar exclusions.  See Interco, 808 F.2d at 683-84; Frank\r\nand Freedus, 45 Cal. App. 4th at 464, 470, 52 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 680,\r\n683; Loyola Marymount, 219 Cal. App. 3d at 1220-22, 271 Cal. Rptr.\r\nat 529-30.  Each court held that the offenses alleged in the\r\ncomplaint were \"related to\" employment.  See Interco, 808 F.2d at\r\n685; Frank and Freedus, 45 Cal. App. 4th at 471-72, 52 Cal. Rptr.\r\n2d at 684; Loyola Marymount, 219 Cal. App. 3d at 1223,  271 Cal.\r\nRptr. at 531. \r\nAs those courts observed, defamatory statements providing\r\nan explanation for termination or directed to performance are\r\n\"related to\" employment.  See Frank and Freedus, 45 Cal. App. 4th\r\nat 471-72, 52 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 684.  Alleged offenses occurring as\r\n\"part and parcel\" of an allegedly wrongful termination are \"plainly\r\nrelated\" to employment.  Loyola Marymount, 219 Cal. App. 3d at\r\n1223, 271 Cal. Rptr. at 531.  Post-employment defamations can be\r\ndirectly or indirectly related to employment, and thus can fall\r\nwithin an exclusion of the sort at issue here.  See id.\r\nThe statements to which Waligora's complaint refers are\r\ncomments as to Waligora's abilities and job performance.  They are\r\nexplanations as to why Diamond terminated Waligora's employment. \r\nThe complaint alleges that Waligora's duties included leading the\r\nchildren's choir.  Allegations 15(b) and 15(c) specifically\r\nindicate that it was not safe for Waligora to be around the\r\nchildren.  Allegation 15(d) explicitly mentions that Diamond was\r\nexplaining his basis for firing Waligora.  Allegation 15(a) does\r\nnot explicitly mention the children or the firing of Waligora, but\r\nplacing it in context with the other provisions in the complaint\r\ncited above, it too relates to Waligora's ability to perform her\r\njob and provides an explanation for the termination of her\r\nemployment.  Because the allegations in the complaint contain\r\nstatements directed to Waligora's abilities and job performance and\r\nare explanations as to why her employment was terminated, we\r\nconclude the offenses are, at the least, indirectly related to\r\nWaligora's employment, if not directly related.  In either case,\r\nthe exclusion applies, and the company has no duty to defend.\r\nThe parish next contends that the district court abused\r\nits discretion by denying its motion to alter, amend, or reconsider\r\nthe judgment.  This contention is wholly without merit.  First, the\r\nmotion asks the court to consider documents other than those agreed\r\nto by the parties in their stipulation.  Moreover, the motion\r\nrefers to only one statement of a truly different substantive\r\nnature, which Diamond allegedly made after the policy had expired. \r\nThus, the statement is immaterial to this litigation. \r\nAffirmed. \r\n",
