The district court's determination\r\n\nof  the  quantity of  drugs  embraced by  the  conspiracy and\r\n\nforeseeable by the defendant will  be reversed only for clear\r\n\nerror. De La Cruz, 996 F.2d at 1314.\r                             \r\n\n     Clark argues on appeal that he could not have reasonably\r\r\n\nforeseen  the amount of drugs involved in the August 21, 1993\r\n\ntransaction because there  is no evidence that he  had joined\r\n\nthe conspiracy by  that date.  He relies on  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nO'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015  (1st Cir. 1992), in which  this court\r                   \r\n\nheld  that \"the  base offense  level of  a co-conspirator  at\r\n\nsentencing  should  reflect only  the  quantity  of drugs  he\r\n\nreasonably foresees  it is  the object  of the conspiracy  to\r\n\ndistribute after he joins the conspiracy.\" Id. at 1026.\r                                                          \r\n\n     In this  case,  however, the  district  court  expressly\r\n\nfound that the  government had proved  by a preponderance  of\r\n\nthe  evidence  that Clark  \"was  part  of  the conspiracy  to\r\n\ndistribute  crack  cocaine  on  August  21,  1993  which  was\r\n\naccomplished by [co-conspirators Terrence and Alfred Brooker]\r\n\nin Newport.\"    Therefore,  O'Campo does not  apply, and  the\r                                               \r\n\nonly  question is whether it was clear error for the district\r\n\ncourt to  conclude that  Clark had  joined the conspiracy  by\r\n\nAugust 21, 1993.\r\n\n     Less  than   a  week   passed  between  the   August  21\r\n\ntransaction  in  Newport and  the  August  27 transaction  in\r\n\nPhiladelphia.      At  Clark's  sentencing  hearing,  Matthew\r\n\nHorace, an undercover agent working for the Federal Bureau of\r\n\nAlcohol,   Tobacco   and  Firearms,   testified   that  Clark\r\n\nidentified himself as the  person in charge at the  August 27\r\n\ntransaction.  He referred to Alfred Brooker as \"his man.\"  He\r\n\ndetermined  who stayed at the  train station and  who went to\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nget the drugs.  Alfred Brooker reportedly told Horace that he\r\n\nand Terrence Brooker worked for Clark in an organization that\r\n\ndistributed crack  cocaine and guns in  Philadelphia and that\r\n\nhe  went frequently  to Newport  to bring  crack and  guns to\r\n\nNewport.   The district court found  this testimony credible.\r\n\n\"At sentencing,  credibility determinations are  the province\r\n\nof  the district court.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1161, 1200 (1st Cir.  1993), cert. denied,     U.S.     , 114\r                                                     \r\n\nS.Ct 2714 (1994).\r\n\n     From this testimony, it would certainly be reasonable to\r\n\ninfer  that Clark had  joined the conspiracy  prior to August\r\n\n21, 1993, and that -- as the self-proclaimed person in charge\r\n\n-- he could reasonably have foreseen the sale by the Brookers\r\n\nof 10.9 grams of cocaine base on that date.   This is not the\r\n\nonly reasonable inference.  Horace testified that he  did not\r\n\nknow the source  of the cocaine sold  on August 21,  1993 and\r\n\nthat the Brookers had told him that  Clark was not their only\r\n\nsource  of   cocaine,  at  least  as   of  September,  1993.1\r\n\nNonetheless, \"where there is more than  one plausible view of\r\n\nthe  circumstances,  the  sentencing  court's   choice  among\r\n\nsupportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.\" United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Ruiz,  905 F.2d  499, 508  (1st Cir.  1990).   The\r                           \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The district court found  that \"the Brookers branched off\r\nafter that  [the August  21 transaction] in  September, 1993,\r\nand  decided to freelance  and find cocaine  and weapons from\r\nother sources\").\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ndistrict court's inclusion of the 10.9  grams of cocaine base\r\n\nsold  on   August  21,   1993  as  \"relevant   conduct\"  when\r\n\ndetermining  Clark's  guideline   sentencing  range  was  not\r\n\nclearly erroneous.\r\n\n     B. Role in the Offense\r                                       \r\n\n     Section 3B1.1(c) of the Guidelines provides, in relevant\r\n\npart, that  defendant's offense  level shall be  increased by\r\n\ntwo levels  if  he was  \"an  organizer, leader,  manager,  or\r\n\nsupervisor.\"  Application of    3B1.1(c) is appropriate where\r\n\nthere  are   at  least  two  participants   in  the  criminal\r\n\nenterprise and where  \"the defendant exercised  control over,\r\n\nor was  otherwise responsible  for organizing the  activities\r\n\nof, at  least one other individual in  committing the crime.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 227 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                     \r\n\nA  district  court's  role-in-the-offense   determination  is\r\n\nreviewed only for clear error. Id.\r                                              \r\n\n     The district  court's application of    3B1.1(c) in this\r\n\ncase was not  clearly erroneous.   There is  no dispute  that\r\n\nmore  than  one  person  was  involved  in  the  offenses  of\r\n\nconviction.  With respect to Clark's exercise of control, the\r\n\nrecord  supports  the  district  court's  finding  that  \"the\r\n\nDefendant  was a leader in the offenses that are the offenses\r\n\nof conviction  in this  case.\"   Horace testified  that Clark\r\n\nannounced during  the August 27  transaction that  he was  in\r\n\ncharge.  Alfred  Brooker told Horace that the Brookers worked\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nfor  Clark.    Clark  called  Alfred Brooker  \"his  man\"  and\r\n\ndirected him to stay  with Horace at the train  station while\r\n\nClark  went to  get the  drugs.   This evidence  supports the\r\n\ndistrict court's finding that Clark exercised control over at\r\n\nleast one  other person  in committing the  charged offenses.\r\n\nThere was no clear error.\r\n\n     Accordingly, appellant's sentence  is affirmed  pursuant\r                                                               \r\n\nto Loc.

He relies on United States v. O'Campo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589965\"><a href=\"/opinion/589965/united-states-v-claudia-ocampo-united-states-v-julian-redeondo/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1992), in which this court held that \"the base offense level of a co-conspirator at sentencing should reflect only the quantity of drugs he reasonably foresees it is the object of the conspiracy to distribute after he joins the conspiracy.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589965\"><a href=\"/opinion/589965/united-states-v-claudia-ocampo-united-states-v-julian-redeondo/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1026.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, the district court expressly found that the government had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Clark \"was part of the conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine on August 21, 1993 which was accomplished by [co- conspirators Terrence and Alfred Brooker] in Newport.\"  Therefore, O'Campo does not apply, and the only question is whether it was clear error for the district court to conclude that Clark had joined the conspiracy by August 21, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than a week passed between the August 21 transaction in Newport and the August 27 transaction in Philadelphia.  At Clark's sentencing hearing, Matthew Horace, an undercover agent working for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, testified that Clark identified himself as the person in charge at the August 27 transaction.  He referred to Alfred Brooker as \"his man.\"  He determined who stayed at the train station and who went to get the drugs.  Alfred Brooker reportedly told Horace that he and Terrence Brooker worked for Clark in an organization that distributed crack cocaine and guns in Philadelphia and that he went frequently to Newport to bring crack and guns to Newport.  The district court found this testimony credible.  \"At sentencing, credibility determinations are the province of the district court.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1200 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct 2714 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this testimony, it would certainly be reasonable to infer that Clark had joined the conspiracy prior to August 21, 1993, and that-as the self-proclaimed person in charge-he could reasonably have foreseen the sale by the Brookers of 10.9 grams of cocaine base on that date.  This is not the only reasonable inference.  Horace testified that he did not know the source of the cocaine sold on August 21, 1993 and that the Brookers had told him that Clark was not their only source of cocaine, at least as of September, 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Nonetheless, \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.\"  United States v.

The district court's inclusion of the 10.9 grams of cocaine base sold on August 21, 1993 as \"relevant conduct\" when determining Clark's guideline sentencing range was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

There is no dispute that more than one person was involved in the offenses of conviction.  With respect to Clark's exercise of control, the record supports the district court's finding that \"the Defendant was a leader in the offenses that are the offenses of conviction in this case.\"  Horace testified that Clark announced during the August 27 transaction that he was in charge.  Alfred Brooker told Horace that the Brookers worked for Clark.  Clark called Alfred Brooker \"his man\" and directed him to stay with Horace at the train station while Clark went to get the drugs.  This evidence supports the district court's finding that Clark exercised control over at least one other person in committing the charged offenses.
