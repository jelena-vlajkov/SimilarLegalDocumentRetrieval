This case concerns the oft-\n                                  \n\nlitigated pollution  exclusion clause  commonly found  in general\n\nliability  insurance  policies.   Insurance  coverage  under this\n\nclause,  or the lack thereof,  has engendered bitter and frequent\n\ndisputes between  insurance  companies and  policyholders  facing\n\nsome form of environmental  liability.  We enter the  fray secure\n\nin  the knowledge that, regardless  of our holding,  we will have\n\nfollowed a sizeable number of the courts that have considered the\n\nissue.   Upon our  own consideration  of the  pollution exclusion\n\nclause as applied to the specific facts of this case, we cast our\n\nlot with those courts narrowly construing the breadth of coverage\n\nafforded under the clause.   We thus affirm the  district court's\n\norder of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiff-appellee, St. Paul  Fire and Marine Insurance\n\nCompany (\"St. Paul\"), brought  this action in the  district court\n\nto  obtain a declaratory judgment that St. Paul had no obligation\n\nunder  an insurance  contract  issued to  the defendant,  Warwick\n\nDyeing Corporation  (\"Warwick\"), to defend  or indemnify  Warwick\n\nfor claims arising  from environmental damages at  the Landfill &amp;\n\nResource  Recovery Superfund  Site  in  North  Smithfield,  Rhode\n\nIsland (the \"L&amp;RR landfill\" or the \"Site\").  St. Paul asserted in\n\nits complaint  that, among other things,  the pollution exclusion\n\nclause of the insurance  policy barred coverage for contamination\n\nat the L&amp;RR landfill  after Warwick arranged for the  disposal of\n\nits waste materials at the Site.\n\n                               -3-\n\n          A.  The Claims\n                        \n\n          Warwick  is in  the business  of dyeing,  finishing and\n\ncoating synthetic and synthetic-natural  fiber blend fabrics.  In\n\nJuly  of 1979, Warwick hired ACME Services, Inc. (\"ACME\"), a duly\n\nlicensed waste  hauler,  to collect,  haul away,  and dispose  of\n\nvarious waste  materials  generated  by  Warwick's  West  Warwick\n\nplant.  The waste  contained certain hazardous substances.   ACME\n\nhauled  the waste  to  the L&amp;RR  Site,  also duly  licensed,  and\n\ndisposed of it in the landfill.   One ACME truck driver stated in\n\nan affidavit that he discharged waste directly into the  landfill\n\nby opening  a drain valve on his truck and letting the waste pour\n\nonto the ground.   There  is no evidence,  however, that  Warwick\n\nknew  where  or   how  ACME  disposed  of  its  waste  materials.\n\nFurthermore,  no party  or governmental  agency has  alleged that\n\nWarwick or ACME improperly discharged Warwick's waste materials.\n\n          On September 18, 1989,  the United States Environmental\n\nProtection Agency (\"EPA\") notified Warwick that it had determined\n\nWarwick was  a \"potentially responsible party\"  (\"PRP\") under the\n\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation  and Liability\n\nAct  (\"CERCLA\"), 42  U.S.C.     9601  et  seq., with  respect  to\n                                             \n\ncontamination at  the L&amp;RR  Site.  The  EPA stated that  the L&amp;RR\n\nSite experienced  releases and  threatened releases  of hazardous\n\nsubstances requiring the EPA  to undertake cleanup activities for\n\nwhich  the PRP's could be  held liable pursuant  to Sections 104,\n\n106(a) and  107(a)  of CERCLA.    42 U.S.C.     9604,  9606(a)  &amp;\n\n9607(a).\n\n                               -4-\n\n          The   EPA  noted  that  \"responsible  parties\"  include\n\n\"persons who arranged for  disposal of hazardous substances found\n\nat  the site.\"  Under  CERCLA, a person  that generates hazardous\n\nsubstances and  arranges for  their disposal is  strictly liable,\n                                                                \n\nregardless  of whether  the person  was at  fault or  whether the\n\nsubstance actually caused or  contributed to any damage, for  all\n\ncosts of remediating environmental damages at  the site where the\n\nsubstances  ultimately are  disposed.   See  Dedham Water  Co. v.\n                                                              \n\nCumberland Farms  Dairy, Inc., 889  F.2d 1146, 1150-56  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1989); O'Neil v. Picillo,  883 F.2d 176, 177-83 (1st  Cir. 1989),\n                        \n\ncert. denied, 493 U.S. 1071 (1990).\n            \n\n          The EPA alleged that  Warwick was a \"responsible party\"\n\nat the L&amp;RR Site because it had arranged, \"by contract agreement,\n\nor otherwise,\" for the \"disposal\" of hazardous  substances at the\n\nL&amp;RR Site.  The EPA demanded reimbursement of the response costs,\n\nmainly for investigation and monitoring, that it had incurred and\n\nplanned to incur at the Site.\n\n          On  June 29,  1990,  the EPA  issued an  administrative\n\norder, pursuant  to    104(e)  &amp; 106(a)  of CERCLA, 42  U.S.C.   \n\n9604(e) &amp;  9606(a), against  twenty  five respondents,  including\n\nWarwick, demanding  that the respondents perform certain remedial\n\nactivities  at the  L&amp;RR Site.   The  order alleged  that Warwick\n\n\"arranged  for  the  disposal  of water  soluble  dye  and fibers\n\ncontaining  acids  and VOCS  [volatile organic  compounds], which\n\nwere disposed  of  at the  Site.\"    According to  the  EPA,  the\n\nhazardous  substances at the  L&amp;RR Site had  been poured directly\n\n                               -5-\n\ninto the landfill  or deposited in drums into  the landfill.  The\n\nEPA's order  documented the  results of an  investigation showing\n\nthat \"the  landfill continues to release  Hazardous Substances to\n\nthe environment.\"   The  EPA made  no allegations, however,  that\n\nwaste was improperly  disposed of  or discharged at  the Site  or\n\nthat  the landfill  was  improperly  maintained.    In  fact,  no\n\nspecific cause of the contamination was mentioned beyond the fact\n\nthat the  named respondents disposed of  waste at the Site.   The\n\nEPA   ordered  that   respondents   undertake  various   remedial\n\nactivities  to  monitor  and   prevent  the  further  release  of\n\nhazardous substances  and to reimburse  the EPA for  its previous\n\nand future actions at the Site.\n\n          On  July 25, 1991, a  group of fourteen plaintiffs that\n\nwere also named by  the EPA as PRPs  at the L&amp;RR Site filed  suit\n\nagainst  Warwick and  forty-six others  for recovery of  past and\n\nfuture  response costs incurred at  the Site.   The suit asserted\n\nthat  Warwick  was  jointly   and  severally  liable  for  having\n\n\"arranged for the disposal of  hazardous substances\" at the site.\n\nSubsequent to the  filing of  this suit, Warwick  entered into  a\n\nsettlement agreement with the plaintiffs under which Warwick paid\n\n$40,000  and assigned  its  rights under  the St.  Paul insurance\n\npolicies to the plaintiffs.\n\n          During  the  EPA's  actions and  the  private  lawsuit,\n\nWarwick  notified  St.  Paul,  its  general  liability  insurance\n\ncarrier,  that  it  was  seeking  defense  costs,  and  possibly,\n\nindemnity coverage for the claims made by the EPA and the private\n\n                               -6-\n\nplaintiffs.   St. Paul  denied  that coverage  existed under  the\n\napplicable insurance policies for  the claims against Warwick and\n\neventually  brought  this   action  to   obtain  an   enforceable\n\ndeclaration of noncoverage.\n\n          B.  The Insurance Contract\n                                    \n\n          St.  Paul  issued a  series  of \"Comprehensive  General\n\nLiability  Policies\" (\"CGL\"  policies) to  Warwick  that provided\n\nWarwick  with  continuous coverage  from  1971  through 1985  for\n\ngeneral commercial risks.\n\n          The insurance policies provided:\n\n            The Company [St.Paul] will pay  on behalf\n            of the Insured  [Warwick] all sums  which\n            the   Insured    shall   become   legally\n            obligated to pay as damages because of:\n\n            Coverage A.: bodily injury or\n            Coverage B.: property damage\n\n            to which this  insurance applies,  caused\n            by  an occurrence, and  the Company shall\n            have  the right  and duty  to defend  any\n            suit against the insured  seeking damages\n            on  account  of  such  bodily  injury  or\n            property   damage  even  if  any  of  the\n            allegations of the  suit are  groundless,\n            false or fraudulent, . . .\n\n          The policies thus provided coverage for property damage\n\ncaused by an \"occurrence\" which the policies defined as:\n\n            an  accident,   including  continuous  or\n            repeated  exposure  to conditions,  which\n            results  in  bodily  injury  or  property\n            damage neither expected nor intended from\n            the standpoint of the insured.\n\n          Following this insuring clause was a list of exclusions\n\nfrom coverage,  including the  pollution exclusion at  issue here\n\n(the \"exclusion\").   Although  the policies  varied from year  to\n\n                               -7-\n\nyear, the  following is  representative  of the  language of  the\n\nexclusion:\n\n            It is agreed that the  insurance does not\n            apply to bodily injury or property damage\n            arising out of the  discharge, dispersal,\n            release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot,\n            fumes,  acids, alkalis,  toxic chemicals,\n            liquids  or  gases,  waste  materials  or\n            other    irritants,    contaminants    or\n            pollutants   into   or  upon   land,  the\n            atmosphere  or any watercourse or body of\n            water.\n\nThe  exclusion contained  an  exception (the  \"exception\")  which\n\nstated:\n\n            This  exclusion does  not  apply if  such\n            discharge,  dispersal, release  or escape\n            is sudden and accidental.\n\n          St.  Paul filed  its action  on January  27, 1991.   In\n\nresponse to  motions for summary  judgment made by  both parties,\n\nthe federal magistrate recommended  that the district court enter\n\na judgment  in favor of St.  Paul.  The magistrate  held that the\n\npollution  exclusion barred coverage for Warwick's claims because\n\nthe discharge of pollutants at the L&amp;RR Site was neither \"sudden\"\n\nnor \"accidental\" as required by  the exception to the  exclusion.\n\nThe district court initially  issued an order on March  18, 1993,\n\nadopting this recommendation.  On the same day, Warwick moved for\n\nreconsideration in light of \"newly discovered evidence\" regarding\n\nrepresentations  made to  state insurance  regulatory authorities\n\nabout  the meaning  of  the pollution  exclusion  clause.     The\n\ndistrict court responded by recalling  its order and vacating the\n\njudgment.   After additional  briefing, however, the  court again\n\nadopted  the magistrate's  recommendation and,  on June  4, 1993,\n\n                               -8-\n\nentered a judgment for St. Paul.\n\n           II.

We find, therefore,  that Warwick bears\n\nthe  burden of establishing that  the discharge of  its waste was\n\n\"sudden  and accidental\"  under  the exception  to the  pollution\n\nexclusion.\n\n          III.  THE POLLUTION EXCLUSION\n\n          The pollution exclusion clause  of the St. Paul-Warwick\n\ninsurance policies bars coverage for \"property damage arising out\n\n                               -11-\n\nof the  discharge, dispersal,  release or escape\"1  of pollutants\n\nof  waste   materials  unless   the  discharge  is   \"sudden  and\n                                                                 \n\naccidental\" (emphasis added).  The issue before us is whether the\n          \n\ndistrict  court erred in finding  that the discharge of Warwick's\n\nwastes at the L&amp;RR landfill was neither sudden nor accidental and\n\nthus not covered under the policies.\n\n          State and federal courts are fairly evenly divided over\n\nthe  meaning  and  application  of the  \"sudden  and  accidental\"\n\nexception  to the  pollution exclusion  clause.   See, e.g.,  CPC\n                                                                 \n\nInt'l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins.

Despite the deep\n\ndivisions in  their holdings, almost  all courts  agree, and  the\n\nparties to this  case agree  as well, that  the term \"sudden  and\n\naccidental,\"   means,  at   the  very   least,   \"unintended  and\n\nunexpected.\"  E.g., CPC  Int'l, 962 F.2d at 91-98;  Hartford, 962\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 1488; New Castle, 933 F.2d at 1192-99; Upjohn, 476 N.W.2d\n                                                     \n\nat 392; Hecla, 811 P.2d at 1091-92.  In  other words, intentional\n             \n\nand  expected  discharges of  pollutants  are  not covered  under\n\npolicies with the standard pollution exclusion.  Because we agree\n\nwith  the district court that the discharge of pollutants was not\n\nunintended and  unexpected in this  case, we  uphold the  summary\n\njudgment  order  on that  ground  without reaching  the  issue of\n\nwhether the term \"sudden,\" as used in the policy, is ambiguous.\n\n          Certain facts of this case are not in dispute.  Warwick\n\npurposefully arranged  to have its waste  materials collected and\n\nhauled off its property.  Those materials were disposed of in the\n\n                               -14-\n\nL&amp;RR  landfill.   At  the same  time,  Warwick presumed  that its\n\nwastes  were  disposed of  lawfully  and  properly.   It  neither\n\nexpected nor intended that contamination of the environment would\n\nresult from the disposal of its wastes.\n\n          The district court found that Warwick's arrangement for\n\nACME to  dispose of its  waste in the regular  course of business\n\nwas  sufficient  to establish  that  the  relevant discharge  was\n\n\"intentional and expected\" and thus not \"accidental.\"  On appeal,\n\nWarwick  argues  that the  district  court  erred in  attributing\n\nWarwick's  act  of generating  the  waste and  arranging  for its\n\ndisposal with ACME's  act of  discharging the waste  at the  L&amp;RR\n\nSite.   Additionally, Warwick contends  that the  court erred  in\n\nfinding the relevant discharge to be the disposal of waste at the\n\nlandfill instead of the subsequent escape of  pollutants from the\n\nlandfill  into  the  surrounding  environment.   We  reject  both\n\narguments.\n\n          A.  Arranging for discharge versus making the discharge\n                                                                 \n\n          Warwick maintains that the pollution exclusion does not\n\napply when  the discharges are made  by a third party,  such as a\n\nwaste hauler  like ACME.   Rather,  Warwick argues,  the relevant\n\ndischarge must be one by the  insured itself.  Because ACME,  and\n\nnot  Warwick,  discharged  this   waste  in  this  case,  Warwick\n\nconcludes that no discharge has  occurred that would trigger  the\n\npollution exclusion  to begin with.  This argument has previously\n\nbeen  rejected by a number of courts.   See Aardvark, 942 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n194; United States Fidelity  &amp; Guar.

For purposes of the exclusion, neither action was\n\nunexpected or unintended by  Warwick.3  Although Warwick did  not\n\n                    \n\n3   There  is  strong disagreement  among  the parties  and,  not\nsurprisingly, among  the courts,  over the issue  of whether  the\ndischarge must  be unintended and unexpected  from the standpoint\n\n                               -16-\n\nknow  the particular site where its waste would be disposed, and,\n\nindeed, the record does not  reveal whether Warwick actually knew\n\nthat  its waste would  be deposited in  a landfill  to begin with\n\n(presumably, Warwick  intended and expected that  its wastes were\n\nbeing  \"taken care of\"  without knowing  any specific  details of\n\ntheir disposal),4  we think  this case provides  every indication\n\nthat the disposal of waste in the L&amp;RR landfill was,  at the very\n\nleast, not unexpected or unintended.\n                                   \n\n          The relevant inquiry is not confined to whether Warwick\n\nactually  knew  or  planned   that  the  discharge  would  occur.\n\nInstead, the relevant  inquiry, according to the  language of the\n\nexception to the pollution exclusion -- \"this exclusion  does not\n\n                    \n\nof the insured or from the  standpoint of some other party who is\nmore closely connected to the actual discharge of  the waste.  As\nthis  issue does  not affect  our holding,  we proceed  under the\nassumption  that  the  relevant point  of  view  is  that of  the\ninsured, Warwick.   We do not decide, however, whether this is in\nfact the proper construction of the contract.\n\n4   In  a  September  14, 1988,  letter  to  the  EPA,  Warwick's\nPresident  stated: \"It was believed by the writer that the liquid\nwaste  was to be carried to a waster-water [sic] sewage treatment\nfacility since the waste was acceptable to the West Warwick Sewer\nSystem.\"   The language of this statement  indicates that Warwick\nnever bothered to find out,  or even to inquire about, where  its\nwaste was going.  It does not indicate that Warwick was told that\nACME would bring its waste to a sewage treatment facility or that\ndisposing of  its  waste  in  a landfill  was  against  Warwick's\nintentions.  Moreover, this  statement indicates that Warwick did\nnot intend for its waste to be  handled in any particular fashion\nbeyond  merely dumping it down the  sewer.  Notations on the L&amp;RR\nmanifests, recording  ACME's disposal  of Warwick's waste  at the\nlandfill, state that, \"this product normally goes to [the] sewer.\nThis  is the  sludge that  collects on  the bottom  [of Warwick's\nwaste  pit].\"   The disposal  of the  waste into  a landfill  was\nconsistent  with  Warwick's normal  treatment of  the waste  -- a\ngeneral disposal  into the normal sanitation  infrastructure.  In\nlight  of this fact, ACME's discharge of Warwick's waste into the\nlandfill could not be viewed as unexpected or unintended.\n\n                               -17-\n\napply if such  discharge . .  . is sudden  and accidental\" --  is\n\nwhether  the discharge  is \"accidental,\"  meaning \"unexpected  or\n\nunintended.\"   Coverage  is  only afforded  if  the discharge  is\n\nneither  expected  nor intended.    \"The  courts are  practically\n\nagreed that the words 'accident' and 'accidental' mean that which\n\nhappens by  chance or fortuitously, without  intention or design,\n\nand which is unexpected, unusual and unforeseen.\"  Aetna Casualty\n                                                                 \n\n&amp; Surety  Co. v. General Dynamics  Corp., 968 F.2d 707,  710 (8th\n                                        \n\nCir. 1992)  (quoting St. Paul Fire &amp;  Marine Ins. Co. v. Northern\n                                                                 \n\nGrain Co., 365 F.2d 361, 364 (8th Cir. 1966)).\n         \n\n          We  think it  would strain  common sense  to find  that\n\nACME's  disposal of Warwick's waste in  a landfill was unexpected\n\nor unintended by Warwick.   A landfill is a  sufficiently common,\n\nif not  likely, destination for the disposal of waste.  We see no\n\nerror  in  presuming that  a party  arranging  to have  its waste\n\ndisposed  of by a licensed  hauler would not  find it fortuitous,\n\nunforeseen, unusual, or  otherwise contrary  to its  expectations\n\nthat its waste was disposed of at a landfill.  This is not a case\n\nwhere ACME did something  surprising or out of the  ordinary with\n\nthe waste after  collecting it from  Warwick.  ACME did  not dump\n\nthe waste  in a river or  at an illegal dumping  ground.  Despite\n\nthe affidavit from an  ACME driver stating that waste  was poured\n\ndirectly onto the ground, the EPA and private party suits against\n\nWarwick  allege no  wrongdoing or  improper dumping at  the Site.\n\nThe  essence of the  EPA's letter and order  is that the property\n\ndamage  at the  Site arose  as a  result of  hazardous substances\n\n                               -18-\n\nbeing  placed  in  the  landfill  to  begin  with;  there  is  no\n\nintermediate  event of  discharge that  Warwick can  point to  as\n\nbeing unexpected or unintended from its standpoint.\n\n          B.  The Relevant Discharge at the L&amp;RR Landfill\n                                                         \n\n          Warwick argues that even if the disposal  of its wastes\n\nat the  L&amp;RR Site was  intended and  expected, this  was not  the\n\nrelevant discharge under the pollution exclusion clause.  Warwick\n\nclaims  that after  the disposal  of  its waste,  some subsequent\n\nunexpected and unintended release  of hazardous substances at the\n\nSite occurred which led to the damage in this case.  The issue of\n\nwhether  the   proper   object  of   Warwick's   intentions   and\n\nexpectations  is the disposal of  waste materials at  the Site or\n\nsome other discharge  of pollutants is  resolved by reference  to\n\nthe contract.  The  language of the pollution exclusion  is clear\n\nthat  coverage does not exist for \"property damage arising out of\n\nthe discharge\" of  waste materials or  other pollutants \"into  or\n             \n\nupon  land\"  unless  \"such   discharge  .  .  .  is   sudden  and\n                                      \n\naccidental.\"   Clearly, the  occurrence that  must be  sudden and\n\naccidental -- or, for  our purposes, unintentional and unexpected\n\n-- is the discharge of pollutants \"into or upon land\"  from which\n\nthe property damage arose.\n\n          It is  well established  that whether the  damages were\n                                                            \n\nintended  or  expected  is irrelevant;  the  pollution  exclusion\n\nplainly refers  to the  discharge and  not  to the  environmental\n\ndamages themselves.

The\n                     \nexclusion  bars  coverage  so long  as  the  discharge  of \"waste\nmaterials\"  was expected and intended and as long as the property\ndamage is \"arising out of\" this discharge.  On this latter point,\nthe EPA's claim that Warwick's waste contained acids and volatile\norganic compounds  which contributed to the  contamination of the\nSite was sufficient to trigger the pollution exclusion.\n\n                               -20-\n\nlawsuit based upon the EPA's actions, state that waste containing\n\nhazardous  substances was placed in  the L&amp;RR landfill  and, as a\n\nresult, the environment surrounding the landfill was contaminated\n\nand  faced the  risk of  continued contamination  unless remedial\n\nmeasures were  taken to shore up  the landfill.  No  cause of the\n\ncontamination, other than the fact that hazardous substances were\n\nplaced  in the  landfill, is  mentioned in  the  order or  in the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n          According  to these  facts,  the  \"property damage\"  at\n\nissue is the contamination of the environment at the L&amp;RR Site as\n\nwell as  the condition  of the  landfill itself,  which threatens\n\nfuture  contamination.  As a result,  the relevant discharge from\n\nwhich  the  damage   arose  is  clearly  the  disposal  of  waste\n\ncontaining hazardous substances into the  landfill.  There is  no\n\nintermediate discharge  onto the land  causing the damage  to the\n\nenvironment.   This is not a case involving ruptured or exploding\n\ntanks,  leaking drums, or even  some sort of  improper dumping of\n\nwaste  after  its  arrival at  the  Site.    Although the  record\n\ncontains  an affidavit from one of ACME's drivers stating that he\n\ndumped  waste directly  onto the  ground, the  EPA and  the other\n\nclaimants make no allegation that any improper disposal of wastes\n\noccurred  at the  L&amp;RR Site  that might  have been  unexpected or\n\nunintended.   In  sum,  because  there  is  no  evidence  of  any\n\nintervening  discharge  between  the  disposal of  waste  on  the\n\nlandfill  and the  actual  damage that  eventually resulted,  the\n\ninitial  disposal of waste at the Site was the relevant discharge\n\n                               -21-\n\nwhich must be sudden  and accidental for coverage to  exist under\n\nthe exception to the pollution  exclusion.

To  put it  another way,  the relevant  discharge for\n\npurposes of the pollution  exclusion was the escape  of hazardous\n\nsubstances  from a state of containment at the L&amp;RR landfill into\n\nor upon the land outside  the confines of the landfill.   Warwick\n\nhighlights  the EPA  statement  that \"the  landfill continues  to\n\nrelease Hazardous  Substances to the  environment.\"  At  the very\n\nleast, Warwick  asserts, the language of  the pollution exclusion\n\nis ambiguous as  to the  meaning of \"discharge\"  in this  context\n\nwhere  several possible releases exist.

As\n\npreviously  noted, the contract is clear that what must be sudden\n\nand accidental is  the discharge and  not the resulting  damages.\n\nThe damage in this  case is the contamination of  the environment\n\nby hazardous  substances  disposed  of  in the  landfill.    This\n\nenvironmental  damage  is essentially  coterminous  with the  so-\n\ncalled \"release\" of hazardous substances from the landfill to the\n\nenvironment.   To  describe  such releases  as  a separate  event\n\nconstituting   an  independent  discharge  would  eviscerate  the\n\nimportant   distinction   established  between   intentional  and\n\nexpected damages  and intentional  and expected discharges.   See\n                                                                 \n\nBroderick, 954 F.2d  at 607  (\"[The insured] tries  to shift  the\n         \n\nfocus to the  second discharge  and attempts to  graft an  intent\n\nrequirement related  to damages onto the  unambiguous language of\n                               \n\nthe policy's  exclusion clause.

What matters is whether the initial discharge  \"into\n\nor upon land\"  that led  to the damage  is expected or  intended;\n\n\"only  the  initial  release  is  relevant  to  the  'sudden  and\n\naccidental' inquiry.\"   A. Johnson,  933 F.2d at  72 &amp; n.9;  see,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Hartford, 962 F.2d at 1491;  Oklahoma Pub., 805 F. Supp. at\n                                                \n\n910; Heileman, 779 F. Supp. at 740.\n             \n\n          Warwick and its amici insist that  the landfill is some\n\ntype of container, like  a storage tank, which did  not discharge\n\nits  contents   into  the  environment  until   some  unforeseen,\n\nunexpected  releasing  event occurred.    Nothing  in the  record\n\nsupports this contention that the L&amp;RR landfill was a containment\n\nvessel such  that  discharges  into  it would  not  constitute  a\n\ndischarge  \"into  or upon  land.\"   The  EPA did  state  that the\n\nlandfill  \"releases\" hazardous  substances \"to  the environment,\"\n\nbut this  simply describes the property damage resulting from the\n\ndischarge of waste into the landfill.  There is no indication the\n\nEPA considered the landfill to be a containment vessel from which\n\nhazardous substances escaped.  To the contrary, the object of the\n\nEPA's concern  in its 87  page order  is the fact  that hazardous\n\nsubstances  were placed in the  L&amp;RR landfill to  begin with, not\n\nthe failure of the landfill to  contain wastes or the failure  of\n\nsome party to properly operate and maintain the landfill.\n\n          We are  not  presented with  a situation  like the  one\n\nrecently  discussed by  Judge Posner  in Patz, where  the insured\n                                             \n\nintended its disposal pit to serve as a containment vessel due to\n\nits clay bottom.  Patz, No. 93-2135,  1994 WL 27280, at *3-5.  In\n                      \n\n                               -24-\n\nthat case, Judge  Posner found  cause to believe  there may  have\n\nbeen a separate unexpected  discharge of pollutants subsequent to\n\nthe placement  of waste into  the pit.   The waste in  this case,\n\nhowever, was  removed from  its containers on  Warwick's premises\n\nand placed into the landfill --  literally onto the land -- where\n\nit later caused contamination.   We presume all parties  involved\n\nexpected  this  to  be an  acceptable  practice,  but  we see  no\n\nevidence  that the  landfill  itself was  expected  to act  as  a\n\ncontainment  vessel.    See  Broderick,   954  F.2d  at  607  n.5\n                                      \n\n(rejecting contention that \"containment ponds\" that may have been\n\nlined  with cement  could  serve as  a  container preventing  the\n\ndischarge of waste into them from being a discharge \"into or upon\n\nland\"  such  that  the  pollution  exclusion  applied  only  when\n\nsubstances  were subsequently  released from  the ponds  into the\n\nsurrounding   environment).     We  therefore   reject  Warwick's\n\ncontention  that  there  exists some  unexpected  and  unintended\n\ndischarge of its wastes triggering the exception to the pollution\n\nexclusion.   Instead,  we agree  with the  district court  to the\n\nextent  it  found  the  pollution  exclusion  applicable  because\n\nWarwick's discharge of  waste was expected and  intended and thus\n\nnot \"accidental.\"\n\n          IV.  REGULATORY ESTOPPEL ARGUMENT ESTOPPED\n\n          Warwick  argues that  St.  Paul should  be estopped  or\n\nbarred from applying the pollution exclusion to the facts of this\n\ncase because of alleged representations that were made by various\n\nparties to  state insurance  regulatory authorities.   See Morton\n                                                                 \n\n                               -25-\n\nInt'l,  Inc. v. General Accident  Ins. Co., 629  A.2d 831, 870-76\n                                          \n\n(N.J.  1993).  This argument  was never made  before the district\n\ncourt.  \"It has long been the rule of this circuit that arguments\n\nnot  made initially  to the  district court  cannot be  raised on\n\nappeal.\"   Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., 861 F.2d 746, 755 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1988);  see, e.g., Vanhaaren v.  State Farm Mut.  Auto. Ins. Co.,\n                                                                \n\n989 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Warwick claims  that it raised the  estoppel issue when\n\nit argued:\n\n            In short, the insurance industry was able\n            to  obtain  approval  of   the  pollution\n            exclusion clause by labelling it merely a\n            \"clarification\"  that  would  not  change\n            coverage  for  pollution  claims.    This\n            Court    should    treat    the    clause\n            accordingly.\n\nThis  statement  hardly  raises  the issue  of  estoppel  for the\n\ndistrict court's consideration.   Warwick's statement was made in\n\nconjunction  with Warwick's  submission to  the court  of various\n\nmaterials  relating  to  representations  made before  the  state\n\ninsurance  regulatory board.    The submissions  and motions  all\n\nrelated to the argument that the insurance contract was ambiguous\n\nand should  be interpreted  in  favor of  Warwick.   No claim  of\n\nestoppel  was made  at  the time.    Consequently, the  issue  is\n\nwaived.\n\n          We  find no \"egregious  circumstances\" or \"miscarriages\n\nof  justice\" that would allow  us to transgress  our rule against\n\nraising  issues for the first time on  appeal.  Kale, 861 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n755.     Furthermore,  this   case  presents  no   other  special\n\n                               -26-\n\ncircumstances,  such  as  an  issue  which  \"the  district  court\n\nexpressly  and   unequivocally  addressed\"  or  an   \"an  ongoing\n\ninjunction, constraining part  of a  governmental program,\"  that\n\nmight otherwise  give  us  the authority  to  decide  the  issue.\n\nTrailer Marine Transport Corp.  v. Rivera V zquez, 977 F.2d  1, 6\n                                                 \n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          V.  MOTIONS DELAYED AND MOTIONS DENIED\n\n          Apparently unsatisfied with the argumentation presented\n\nin their  briefs and in the briefs  of various amici, the parties\n                                                    \n\nin this case  have filed a huge  batch of additional  motions and\n\nmaterials  in  this case.   As  a  consequence, we  received more\n\npaperwork  after  the case  was briefed  and  argued than  we did\n\nbefore argument.  Because  the majority of this deluge  is either\n\nsuperfluous, moot, or flaunts even  a liberal application of  our\n\nrules concerning  page limits and  the proper subject  matter for\n\nmotions and other filings, we deny most of the motions and strike\n\nmany of the other filings.\n\n          For the  record, we  deny the motion  for certification\n\nand  grant St.  Paul's  motion to  strike Warwick's  supplemental\n\nbrief  in support of certification.  St. Paul's motions to strike\n\nextrinsic materials  or alternatively expand the  record are moot\n\nas  we  found no  cause  to  consider  the  extrinsic  materials.\n\nWarwick's motion  to  strike St.  Paul's effusive  filing on  the\n\nNestle case is granted.  We deny St. Paul leave to file responses\n      \n\nand replies to various  reply briefs and to  Warwick's opposition\n\nto  St. Paul's  motion  to strike  extrinsic  evidence.   In  the\n\n                               -27-\n\nalternative,  we  grant Warwick's  motion  to  strike St.  Paul's\n\nresponses and replies.  Lest we neglect the amici, we deny amicus\n                                                                 \n\nTextron's motion to file  a reply to several other  amicus briefs\n\nand  we find  that  St.  Paul's  motion  to  strike  material  in\n\nTextron's brief  is  moot.   Finally, we  deny Mid-America  Legal\n\nFoundation  permission  to  file an  amicus  brief  and  we grant\n\nWarwick's motion to strike Aetna's amicus brief.\n\n          We  affirm  the  district   court's  order  of  summary\n                                                                 \n\njudgment and dispose of all other motions as described above.\n                                                            \n\n                               -28-\n",

This case concerns the oft-\n                                  \n\nlitigated pollution  exclusion clause  commonly found  in general\n\nliability  insurance  policies.   Insurance  coverage  under this\n\nclause,  or the lack thereof,  has engendered bitter and frequent\n\ndisputes between  insurance  companies and  policyholders  facing\n\nsome form of environmental  liability.  We enter the  fray secure\n\nin  the knowledge that, regardless  of our holding,  we will have\n\nfollowed a sizeable number of the courts that have considered the\n\nissue.   Upon our  own consideration  of the  pollution exclusion\n\nclause as applied to the specific facts of this case, we cast our\n\nlot with those courts narrowly construing the breadth of coverage\n\nafforded under the clause.   We thus affirm the  district court's\n\norder of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiff-appellee, St. Paul  Fire and Marine Insurance\n\nCompany (\"St. Paul\"), brought  this action in the  district court\n\nto  obtain a declaratory judgment that St. Paul had no obligation\n\nunder  an insurance  contract  issued to  the defendant,  Warwick\n\nDyeing Corporation  (\"Warwick\"), to defend  or indemnify  Warwick\n\nfor claims arising  from environmental damages at  the Landfill &amp;\n\nResource  Recovery Superfund  Site  in  North  Smithfield,  Rhode\n\nIsland (the \"L&amp;RR landfill\" or the \"Site\").  St. Paul asserted in\n\nits complaint  that, among other things,  the pollution exclusion\n\nclause of the insurance  policy barred coverage for contamination\n\nat the L&amp;RR landfill  after Warwick arranged for the  disposal of\n\nits waste materials at the Site.\n\n                               -3-\n\n          A.  The Claims\n                        \n\n          Warwick  is in  the business  of dyeing,  finishing and\n\ncoating synthetic and synthetic-natural  fiber blend fabrics.  In\n\nJuly  of 1979, Warwick hired ACME Services, Inc. (\"ACME\"), a duly\n\nlicensed waste  hauler,  to collect,  haul away,  and dispose  of\n\nvarious waste  materials  generated  by  Warwick's  West  Warwick\n\nplant.  The waste  contained certain hazardous substances.   ACME\n\nhauled  the waste  to  the L&amp;RR  Site,  also duly  licensed,  and\n\ndisposed of it in the landfill.   One ACME truck driver stated in\n\nan affidavit that he discharged waste directly into the  landfill\n\nby opening  a drain valve on his truck and letting the waste pour\n\nonto the ground.   There  is no evidence,  however, that  Warwick\n\nknew  where  or   how  ACME  disposed  of  its  waste  materials.\n\nFurthermore,  no party  or governmental  agency has  alleged that\n\nWarwick or ACME improperly discharged Warwick's waste materials.\n\n          On September 18, 1989,  the United States Environmental\n\nProtection Agency (\"EPA\") notified Warwick that it had determined\n\nWarwick was  a \"potentially responsible party\"  (\"PRP\") under the\n\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation  and Liability\n\nAct  (\"CERCLA\"), 42  U.S.C.     9601  et  seq., with  respect  to\n                                             \n\ncontamination at  the L&amp;RR  Site.  The  EPA stated that  the L&amp;RR\n\nSite experienced  releases and  threatened releases  of hazardous\n\nsubstances requiring the EPA  to undertake cleanup activities for\n\nwhich  the PRP's could be  held liable pursuant  to Sections 104,\n\n106(a) and  107(a)  of CERCLA.    42 U.S.C.     9604,  9606(a)  &amp;\n\n9607(a).\n\n                               -4-\n\n          The   EPA  noted  that  \"responsible  parties\"  include\n\n\"persons who arranged for  disposal of hazardous substances found\n\nat  the site.\"  Under  CERCLA, a person  that generates hazardous\n\nsubstances and  arranges for  their disposal is  strictly liable,\n                                                                \n\nregardless  of whether  the person  was at  fault or  whether the\n\nsubstance actually caused or  contributed to any damage, for  all\n\ncosts of remediating environmental damages at  the site where the\n\nsubstances  ultimately are  disposed.

The EPA demanded reimbursement of the response costs,\n\nmainly for investigation and monitoring, that it had incurred and\n\nplanned to incur at the Site.\n\n          On  June 29,  1990,  the EPA  issued an  administrative\n\norder, pursuant  to    104(e)  &amp; 106(a)  of CERCLA, 42  U.S.C.   \n\n9604(e) &amp;  9606(a), against  twenty  five respondents,  including\n\nWarwick, demanding  that the respondents perform certain remedial\n\nactivities  at the  L&amp;RR Site.   The  order alleged  that Warwick\n\n\"arranged  for  the  disposal  of water  soluble  dye  and fibers\n\ncontaining  acids  and VOCS  [volatile organic  compounds], which\n\nwere disposed  of  at the  Site.\"    According to  the  EPA,  the\n\nhazardous  substances at the  L&amp;RR Site had  been poured directly\n\n                               -5-\n\ninto the landfill  or deposited in drums into  the landfill.  The\n\nEPA's order  documented the  results of an  investigation showing\n\nthat \"the  landfill continues to release  Hazardous Substances to\n\nthe environment.\"   The  EPA made  no allegations, however,  that\n\nwaste was improperly  disposed of  or discharged at  the Site  or\n\nthat  the landfill  was  improperly  maintained.    In  fact,  no\n\nspecific cause of the contamination was mentioned beyond the fact\n\nthat the  named respondents disposed of  waste at the Site.   The\n\nEPA   ordered  that   respondents   undertake  various   remedial\n\nactivities  to  monitor  and   prevent  the  further  release  of\n\nhazardous substances  and to reimburse  the EPA for  its previous\n\nand future actions at the Site.\n\n          On  July 25, 1991, a  group of fourteen plaintiffs that\n\nwere also named by  the EPA as PRPs  at the L&amp;RR Site filed  suit\n\nagainst  Warwick and  forty-six others  for recovery of  past and\n\nfuture  response costs incurred at  the Site.   The suit asserted\n\nthat  Warwick  was  jointly   and  severally  liable  for  having\n\n\"arranged for the disposal of  hazardous substances\" at the site.\n\nSubsequent to the  filing of  this suit, Warwick  entered into  a\n\nsettlement agreement with the plaintiffs under which Warwick paid\n\n$40,000  and assigned  its  rights under  the St.  Paul insurance\n\npolicies to the plaintiffs.\n\n          During  the  EPA's  actions and  the  private  lawsuit,\n\nWarwick  notified  St.  Paul,  its  general  liability  insurance\n\ncarrier,  that  it  was  seeking  defense  costs,  and  possibly,\n\nindemnity coverage for the claims made by the EPA and the private\n\n                               -6-\n\nplaintiffs.   St. Paul  denied  that coverage  existed under  the\n\napplicable insurance policies for  the claims against Warwick and\n\neventually  brought  this   action  to   obtain  an   enforceable\n\ndeclaration of noncoverage.\n\n          B.  The Insurance Contract\n                                    \n\n          St.  Paul  issued a  series  of \"Comprehensive  General\n\nLiability  Policies\" (\"CGL\"  policies) to  Warwick  that provided\n\nWarwick  with  continuous coverage  from  1971  through 1985  for\n\ngeneral commercial risks.\n\n          The insurance policies provided:\n\n            The Company [St.Paul] will pay  on behalf\n            of the Insured  [Warwick] all sums  which\n            the   Insured    shall   become   legally\n            obligated to pay as damages because of:\n\n            Coverage A.: bodily injury or\n            Coverage B.: property damage\n\n            to which this  insurance applies,  caused\n            by  an occurrence, and  the Company shall\n            have  the right  and duty  to defend  any\n            suit against the insured  seeking damages\n            on  account  of  such  bodily  injury  or\n            property   damage  even  if  any  of  the\n            allegations of the  suit are  groundless,\n            false or fraudulent, . . .\n\n          The policies thus provided coverage for property damage\n\ncaused by an \"occurrence\" which the policies defined as:\n\n            an  accident,   including  continuous  or\n            repeated  exposure  to conditions,  which\n            results  in  bodily  injury  or  property\n            damage neither expected nor intended from\n            the standpoint of the insured.\n\n          Following this insuring clause was a list of exclusions\n\nfrom coverage,  including the  pollution exclusion at  issue here\n\n(the \"exclusion\").   Although  the policies  varied from year  to\n\n                               -7-\n\nyear, the  following is  representative  of the  language of  the\n\nexclusion:\n\n            It is agreed that the  insurance does not\n            apply to bodily injury or property damage\n            arising out of the  discharge, dispersal,\n            release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot,\n            fumes,  acids, alkalis,  toxic chemicals,\n            liquids  or  gases,  waste  materials  or\n            other    irritants,    contaminants    or\n            pollutants   into   or  upon   land,  the\n            atmosphere  or any watercourse or body of\n            water.\n\nThe  exclusion contained  an  exception (the  \"exception\")  which\n\nstated:\n\n            This  exclusion does  not  apply if  such\n            discharge,  dispersal, release  or escape\n            is sudden and accidental.\n\n          St.  Paul filed  its action  on January  27, 1991.   In\n\nresponse to  motions for summary  judgment made by  both parties,\n\nthe federal magistrate recommended  that the district court enter\n\na judgment  in favor of St.  Paul.  The magistrate  held that the\n\npollution  exclusion barred coverage for Warwick's claims because\n\nthe discharge of pollutants at the L&amp;RR Site was neither \"sudden\"\n\nnor \"accidental\" as required by  the exception to the  exclusion.\n\nThe district court initially  issued an order on March  18, 1993,\n\nadopting this recommendation.  On the same day, Warwick moved for\n\nreconsideration in light of \"newly discovered evidence\" regarding\n\nrepresentations  made to  state insurance  regulatory authorities\n\nabout  the meaning  of  the pollution  exclusion  clause.     The\n\ndistrict court responded by recalling  its order and vacating the\n\njudgment.   After additional  briefing, however, the  court again\n\nadopted  the magistrate's  recommendation and,  on June  4, 1993,\n\n                               -8-\n\nentered a judgment for St. Paul.\n\n           II.

We find, therefore,  that Warwick bears\n\nthe  burden of establishing that  the discharge of  its waste was\n\n\"sudden  and accidental\"  under  the exception  to the  pollution\n\nexclusion.\n\n          III.  THE POLLUTION EXCLUSION\n\n          The pollution exclusion clause  of the St. Paul-Warwick\n\ninsurance policies bars coverage for \"property damage arising out\n\n                               -11-\n\nof the  discharge, dispersal,  release or escape\"1  of pollutants\n\nof  waste   materials  unless   the  discharge  is   \"sudden  and\n                                                                 \n\naccidental\" (emphasis added).  The issue before us is whether the\n          \n\ndistrict  court erred in finding  that the discharge of Warwick's\n\nwastes at the L&amp;RR landfill was neither sudden nor accidental and\n\nthus not covered under the policies.\n\n          State and federal courts are fairly evenly divided over\n\nthe  meaning  and  application  of the  \"sudden  and  accidental\"\n\nexception  to the  pollution exclusion  clause.

In  other words, intentional\n             \n\nand  expected  discharges of  pollutants  are  not covered  under\n\npolicies with the standard pollution exclusion.  Because we agree\n\nwith  the district court that the discharge of pollutants was not\n\nunintended and  unexpected in this  case, we  uphold the  summary\n\njudgment  order  on that  ground  without reaching  the  issue of\n\nwhether the term \"sudden,\" as used in the policy, is ambiguous.\n\n          Certain facts of this case are not in dispute.  Warwick\n\npurposefully arranged  to have its waste  materials collected and\n\nhauled off its property.  Those materials were disposed of in the\n\n                               -14-\n\nL&amp;RR  landfill.   At  the same  time,  Warwick presumed  that its\n\nwastes  were  disposed of  lawfully  and  properly.   It  neither\n\nexpected nor intended that contamination of the environment would\n\nresult from the disposal of its wastes.\n\n          The district court found that Warwick's arrangement for\n\nACME to  dispose of its  waste in the regular  course of business\n\nwas  sufficient  to establish  that  the  relevant discharge  was\n\n\"intentional and expected\" and thus not \"accidental.\"  On appeal,\n\nWarwick  argues  that the  district  court  erred in  attributing\n\nWarwick's  act  of generating  the  waste and  arranging  for its\n\ndisposal with ACME's  act of  discharging the waste  at the  L&amp;RR\n\nSite.   Additionally, Warwick contends  that the  court erred  in\n\nfinding the relevant discharge to be the disposal of waste at the\n\nlandfill instead of the subsequent escape of  pollutants from the\n\nlandfill  into  the  surrounding  environment.   We  reject  both\n\narguments.\n\n          A.  Arranging for discharge versus making the discharge\n                                                                 \n\n          Warwick maintains that the pollution exclusion does not\n\napply when  the discharges are made  by a third party,  such as a\n\nwaste hauler  like ACME.   Rather,  Warwick argues,  the relevant\n\ndischarge must be one by the  insured itself.  Because ACME,  and\n\nnot  Warwick,  discharged  this   waste  in  this  case,  Warwick\n\nconcludes that no discharge has  occurred that would trigger  the\n\npollution exclusion  to begin with.  This argument has previously\n\nbeen  rejected by a number of courts.

As\nthis  issue does  not affect  our holding,  we proceed  under the\nassumption  that  the  relevant point  of  view  is  that of  the\ninsured, Warwick.   We do not decide, however, whether this is in\nfact the proper construction of the contract.\n\n4   In  a  September  14, 1988,  letter  to  the  EPA,  Warwick's\nPresident  stated: \"It was believed by the writer that the liquid\nwaste  was to be carried to a waster-water [sic] sewage treatment\nfacility since the waste was acceptable to the West Warwick Sewer\nSystem.\"   The language of this statement  indicates that Warwick\nnever bothered to find out,  or even to inquire about, where  its\nwaste was going.  It does not indicate that Warwick was told that\nACME would bring its waste to a sewage treatment facility or that\ndisposing of  its  waste  in  a landfill  was  against  Warwick's\nintentions.  Moreover, this  statement indicates that Warwick did\nnot intend for its waste to be  handled in any particular fashion\nbeyond  merely dumping it down the  sewer.  Notations on the L&amp;RR\nmanifests, recording  ACME's disposal  of Warwick's waste  at the\nlandfill, state that, \"this product normally goes to [the] sewer.\nThis  is the  sludge that  collects on  the bottom  [of Warwick's\nwaste  pit].\"   The disposal  of the  waste into  a landfill  was\nconsistent  with  Warwick's normal  treatment of  the waste  -- a\ngeneral disposal  into the normal sanitation  infrastructure.  In\nlight  of this fact, ACME's discharge of Warwick's waste into the\nlandfill could not be viewed as unexpected or unintended.\n\n                               -17-\n\napply if such  discharge . .  . is sudden  and accidental\" --  is\n\nwhether  the discharge  is \"accidental,\"  meaning \"unexpected  or\n\nunintended.\"   Coverage  is  only afforded  if  the discharge  is\n\nneither  expected  nor intended.    \"The  courts are  practically\n\nagreed that the words 'accident' and 'accidental' mean that which\n\nhappens by  chance or fortuitously, without  intention or design,\n\nand which is unexpected, unusual and unforeseen.\"  Aetna Casualty\n                                                                 \n\n&amp; Surety  Co. v.

A landfill is a  sufficiently common,\n\nif not  likely, destination for the disposal of waste.  We see no\n\nerror  in  presuming that  a party  arranging  to have  its waste\n\ndisposed  of by a licensed  hauler would not  find it fortuitous,\n\nunforeseen, unusual, or  otherwise contrary  to its  expectations\n\nthat its waste was disposed of at a landfill.  This is not a case\n\nwhere ACME did something  surprising or out of the  ordinary with\n\nthe waste after  collecting it from  Warwick.  ACME did  not dump\n\nthe waste  in a river or  at an illegal dumping  ground.  Despite\n\nthe affidavit from an  ACME driver stating that waste  was poured\n\ndirectly onto the ground, the EPA and private party suits against\n\nWarwick  allege no  wrongdoing or  improper dumping at  the Site.\n\nThe  essence of the  EPA's letter and order  is that the property\n\ndamage  at the  Site arose  as a  result of  hazardous substances\n\n                               -18-\n\nbeing  placed  in  the  landfill  to  begin  with;  there  is  no\n\nintermediate  event of  discharge that  Warwick can  point to  as\n\nbeing unexpected or unintended from its standpoint.\n\n          B.  The Relevant Discharge at the L&amp;RR Landfill\n                                                         \n\n          Warwick argues that even if the disposal  of its wastes\n\nat the  L&amp;RR Site was  intended and  expected, this  was not  the\n\nrelevant discharge under the pollution exclusion clause.  Warwick\n\nclaims  that after  the disposal  of  its waste,  some subsequent\n\nunexpected and unintended release  of hazardous substances at the\n\nSite occurred which led to the damage in this case.  The issue of\n\nwhether  the   proper   object  of   Warwick's   intentions   and\n\nexpectations  is the disposal of  waste materials at  the Site or\n\nsome other discharge  of pollutants is  resolved by reference  to\n\nthe contract.  The  language of the pollution exclusion  is clear\n\nthat  coverage does not exist for \"property damage arising out of\n\nthe discharge\" of  waste materials or  other pollutants \"into  or\n             \n\nupon  land\"  unless  \"such   discharge  .  .  .  is   sudden  and\n                                      \n\naccidental.\"   Clearly, the  occurrence that  must be  sudden and\n\naccidental -- or, for  our purposes, unintentional and unexpected\n\n-- is the discharge of pollutants \"into or upon land\"  from which\n\nthe property damage arose.\n\n          It is  well established  that whether the  damages were\n                                                            \n\nintended  or  expected  is irrelevant;  the  pollution  exclusion\n\nplainly refers  to the  discharge and  not  to the  environmental\n\ndamages themselves.

The\n                     \nexclusion  bars  coverage  so long  as  the  discharge  of \"waste\nmaterials\"  was expected and intended and as long as the property\ndamage is \"arising out of\" this discharge.  On this latter point,\nthe EPA's claim that Warwick's waste contained acids and volatile\norganic compounds  which contributed to the  contamination of the\nSite was sufficient to trigger the pollution exclusion.\n\n                               -20-\n\nlawsuit based upon the EPA's actions, state that waste containing\n\nhazardous  substances was placed in  the L&amp;RR landfill  and, as a\n\nresult, the environment surrounding the landfill was contaminated\n\nand  faced the  risk of  continued contamination  unless remedial\n\nmeasures were  taken to shore up  the landfill.  No  cause of the\n\ncontamination, other than the fact that hazardous substances were\n\nplaced  in the  landfill, is  mentioned in  the  order or  in the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n          According  to these  facts,  the  \"property damage\"  at\n\nissue is the contamination of the environment at the L&amp;RR Site as\n\nwell as  the condition  of the  landfill itself,  which threatens\n\nfuture  contamination.  As a result,  the relevant discharge from\n\nwhich  the  damage   arose  is  clearly  the  disposal  of  waste\n\ncontaining hazardous substances into the  landfill.  There is  no\n\nintermediate discharge  onto the land  causing the damage  to the\n\nenvironment.   This is not a case involving ruptured or exploding\n\ntanks,  leaking drums, or even  some sort of  improper dumping of\n\nwaste  after  its  arrival at  the  Site.    Although the  record\n\ncontains  an affidavit from one of ACME's drivers stating that he\n\ndumped  waste directly  onto the  ground, the  EPA and  the other\n\nclaimants make no allegation that any improper disposal of wastes\n\noccurred  at the  L&amp;RR Site  that might  have been  unexpected or\n\nunintended.

As\n\npreviously  noted, the contract is clear that what must be sudden\n\nand accidental is  the discharge and  not the resulting  damages.\n\nThe damage in this  case is the contamination of  the environment\n\nby hazardous  substances  disposed  of  in the  landfill.    This\n\nenvironmental  damage  is essentially  coterminous  with the  so-\n\ncalled \"release\" of hazardous substances from the landfill to the\n\nenvironment.   To  describe  such releases  as  a separate  event\n\nconstituting   an  independent  discharge  would  eviscerate  the\n\nimportant   distinction   established  between   intentional  and\n\nexpected damages  and intentional  and expected discharges.

Nothing  in the  record\n\nsupports this contention that the L&amp;RR landfill was a containment\n\nvessel such  that  discharges  into  it would  not  constitute  a\n\ndischarge  \"into  or upon  land.\"   The  EPA did  state  that the\n\nlandfill  \"releases\" hazardous  substances \"to  the environment,\"\n\nbut this  simply describes the property damage resulting from the\n\ndischarge of waste into the landfill.  There is no indication the\n\nEPA considered the landfill to be a containment vessel from which\n\nhazardous substances escaped.  To the contrary, the object of the\n\nEPA's concern  in its 87  page order  is the fact  that hazardous\n\nsubstances  were placed in the  L&amp;RR landfill to  begin with, not\n\nthe failure of the landfill to  contain wastes or the failure  of\n\nsome party to properly operate and maintain the landfill.\n\n          We are  not  presented with  a situation  like the  one\n\nrecently  discussed by  Judge Posner  in Patz, where  the insured\n                                             \n\nintended its disposal pit to serve as a containment vessel due to\n\nits clay bottom.

The waste in  this case,\n\nhowever, was  removed from  its containers on  Warwick's premises\n\nand placed into the landfill --  literally onto the land -- where\n\nit later caused contamination.   We presume all parties  involved\n\nexpected  this  to  be an  acceptable  practice,  but  we see  no\n\nevidence  that the  landfill  itself was  expected  to act  as  a\n\ncontainment  vessel.

We  therefore   reject  Warwick's\n\ncontention  that  there  exists some  unexpected  and  unintended\n\ndischarge of its wastes triggering the exception to the pollution\n\nexclusion.   Instead,  we agree  with the  district court  to the\n\nextent  it  found  the  pollution  exclusion  applicable  because\n\nWarwick's discharge of  waste was expected and  intended and thus\n\nnot \"accidental.\"\n\n          IV.

We deny St. Paul leave to file responses\n      \n\nand replies to various  reply briefs and to  Warwick's opposition\n\nto  St. Paul's  motion  to strike  extrinsic  evidence.   In  the\n\n                               -27-\n\nalternative,  we  grant Warwick's  motion  to  strike St.  Paul's\n\nresponses and replies.  Lest we neglect the amici, we deny amicus\n                                                                 \n\nTextron's motion to file  a reply to several other  amicus briefs\n\nand  we find  that  St.  Paul's  motion  to  strike  material  in\n\nTextron's brief  is  moot.   Finally, we  deny Mid-America  Legal\n\nFoundation  permission  to  file an  amicus  brief  and  we grant\n\nWarwick's motion to strike Aetna's amicus brief.\n\n          We  affirm  the  district   court's  order  of  summary\n                                                                 \n\njudgment and dispose of all other motions as described above.\n                                                            \n\n                               -28-\n</pre>",
