Turning  from the  general to  the\n\nparticular,  we recommended  that district courts  employ varying\n\nlevels of scrutiny in connection with  such motions, adapting the\n\nlevel of scrutiny to the exigencies  of the individual case.  See\r                                                                           \n\nid. at 674-78.

(FMI) from an  order dismissing its  commercial tort action\n\nagainst Babcock  &amp; Wilcox Canada (BWC)   illustrates vividly that\n\nBoit's   flexible  approach   demands   circumspection   in   its\r              \n\napplication.   In this  case, the district  court applied  Boit's\r                                                                         \n\nintermediate standard  too rashly when,  eager to test  whether a\n\nlegally  sufficient showing  of  jurisdiction had  been made,  it\n\nneither  gave the parties adequate notice that it intended to use\n\nthis special standard nor ensured that FMI had a fair opportunity\n\nto  gather and present the evidence necessary for such a showing.\n\nWhile  we are not  without sympathy for  the district judge    he\n\ninherited this  case midstream,  and Boit, in  retrospect, should\r                                                   \n\nhave emphasized the need to forewarn litigants of a trial court's\n\nintention  to  go  beyond  the  prima  facie  standard  typically\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nassociated with motions to dismiss under Fed.

THE FACTS\n\n          We  sketch the operative  facts, drawing liberally from\n\nthe  lower court's opinion.  See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp;\r                                                                           \n\nWilcox Can., 848 F. Supp. 271 (D. Mass. 1994).\r                     \n\n          The  parties to  this appeal  are  quondam competitors:\n\nFMI is  a Massachusetts corporation engaged  in furnishing sludge\n\nand particle  removal services for nuclear  steam generators; BWC\n\nis  a Canadian  firm  that,  among  other things,  services  such\n\ngenerators.  At  its  core,  the litigation  concerns  a  virtual\n\nmeltdown of the parties' relationship, which in turn  detonated a\n\nlawsuit.  The tale follows.\n\n          As early as 1988, FMI and BWC  entertained the prospect\n\nof  a joint venture to furnish sludge removal services to Ontario\n\nHydro,  a  Canadian utility.    Although the  joint  venture idea\n\nstalled  and  the principals  went  their  separate ways,  Canada\n\nremained an  alluring target.  But  the road to  prosperity had a\n\nlarge  pothole.    FMI's  then-extant technology,  known  by  the\n\nacronym  \"CECIL,\" featured flexible lances that directed powerful\n\nbursts  of water at pockets  of sludge found  within the hard-to-\n\nreach crannies of nuclear  steam boilers.  While this  system had\n\ndistinct  competitive advantages  over  BWC's  rival rigid  lance\n\nsystem, neither system performed satisfactorily  in the cleansing\n\nof Canadian boilers (known in the trade as Candu boilers).\n\n          Determined  to  detour  around  the  \"can't  do  Candu\"\n\n                                3\r\r\n\npothole  and penetrate the Canadian market, BWC set out to design\n\na  lance of  unprecedented  flexibility.   In  1989, while  BWC's\n\ndevelopment  efforts  were  underway,  Ontario Hydro  (acting  on\n\nbehalf of  a consortium  of Canadian  utilities) retained FMI  to\n\nstudy the feasibility of adapting FMI's flexible lance technology\n\nfor use  in  Candu  boilers.   As  part  of  this  endeavor,  FMI\n\ncontracted with  a well-known supplier, U.S. Composites (CompCo),\n\nto create a new type of hose.\n\n          In March 1990, Robert A.S. Lee, an FMI employee who had\n\nbeen  instrumental  in  perfecting  CECIL, attended  an  industry\n\nconference  in  Tennessee.   Daniel  St.  Louis, a  BWC  engineer\n\ninvolved  in that  company's  push to  fashion a  flexible lance,\n\nattended  the same session.  During a previous encounter, the men\n\nhad  casually discussed high  pressure hoses.   On this occasion,\n\ntheir  conversation  became  more  detailed and  focused  on  the\n\npossibility  of  reinforcing  high pressure  hoses  with  certain\n\nfibers.    The   discussion  proved  prophetic:    a   few  weeks\n\nthereafter, CompCo delivered the special  hose that FMI had asked\n\nit  to design.    The hose  was thought  in  certain quarters  to\n\nrepresent  a  technological  breakthrough.     One  of  its  more\n\nrevolutionary features  was a  double-layered Kevlar sheath  that\n\nsupplied desired reinforcement.\n\n          On May 11, 1990, an Ontario Hydro representative, James\n\nMalaugh, traveled  to FMI's  plant in Waltham,  Massachusetts, to\n\nassess FMI's  progress.   Seeking expertise and  insight, Malaugh\n\ninvited St. Louis to join him.  Nonplussed, FMI allowed St. Louis\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nto attend only after BWC signed a confidentiality agreement.  The\n\nagreement,  duly  executed  by  a ranking  official  of  BWC  and\n\ntransmitted via facsimile machine from  Canada, acknowledged that\n\nFMI  \"anticipate[d] disclosing  . .  . certain  information  of a\n\nnovel, proprietary,  or  confidential nature,\"  and  memorialized\n\nBWC's  promise \"not  to  use [the]  information  for any  purpose\n\nunless specifically authorized in writing by FMI.\"  The agreement\n\nalso  stipulated that  FMI would  be entitled  to relief  for any\n\nbreach.\n\n          William  Leary,  the  FMI  engineer in  charge  of  the\n\nOntario  Hydro   project,  hosted  the  Waltham   session.    The\n\nparticipants   debated   various   aspects  of   flexible   lance\n\ntechnology, including the  preferred characteristics of  the hose\n\nand possible  methods  of reinforcement.    At one  point  Leary,\n\nresponding to a direct  question by St. Louis, identified  CompCo\n\nas FMI's supplier.  Not long after the Waltham meeting, St. Louis\n\ncontacted  CompCo  and inquired  about  the  possibility of  that\n\ncompany  fabricating  a  similar  hose   for  BWC.    St.  Louis'\n\nsuggestion  that FMI  would  not object  proved overly  sanguine;\n\nafter consulting with FMI, CompCo rebuffed BWC's overtures.1\n\n          Undaunted, BWC forged ahead in its research effort.  It\n\neventually  succeeded in  manufacturing its  own flexible  lance,\n\nsuitable for  Candu boilers.   Thereafter, Ontario  Hydro awarded\n\nBWC a lucrative contract.\n                    \r                              \n\n     1Nonetheless, BWC managed to obtain a sample of  the special\nhose.   The parties dispute whether this occurred before or after\nthe May 11 meeting.\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nII.  THE LITIGATION\r          II.  THE LITIGATION\n\n          On  November 12,  1993,  FMI, claiming  to have  gotten\n\nhosed,  commenced suit against BWC in  the United States District\n\nCourt  for the  District  of Massachusetts.   Invoking  diversity\n\njurisdiction,  28 U.S.C.   1332 (1988), FMI charged breach of the\n\nconfidentiality agreement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and\n\nunfair competition.  BWC moved to dismiss for lack of in personam\r                                                                           \n\njurisdiction  or, in the alternative,  on the basis  of forum non\r                                                                           \n\nconveniens.\r                    \n\n          Judge  Keeton  drew  the  case.    Concerns  about  the\n\nparties'  trade  secrets  slowed discovery  to  a  crawl.   At  a\n\nconference held  on December 16,  1993, Judge Keeton  scheduled a\n\nhearing  on the motion for  January 4, 1994, restricted discovery\n\nfor the time being to matters \"bear[ing]  upon the jurisdictional\n\nissue,\" and advised counsel  that, absent an agreement dissolving\n\nthe discovery deadlock, he would use  the traditional prima facie\n\nstandard, not the  special intermediate  standard, in  evaluating\n\nthe motion to dismiss.\n\n          At that point, fate intervened.  In a routine shuffling\n\nof cases  ancillary to  the appointment  of several  new judicial\n\nofficers, this case was plucked from Judge Keeton  and reassigned\n\nto  Judge Stearns.   The  January 4  hearing  never materialized.\n\nInstead,  Judge Stearns heard the motion to dismiss on February 1\n\nand 2, 1994.  Though the discovery dispute had not been resolved,\n\nJudge Stearns, to  FMI's obvious chagrin,  undertook not only  to\n\nprobe  the existence  of the  basic  facts on  which jurisdiction\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nmight be  premised but also to adjudicate  certain ultimate facts\n\n(e.g.,   whether   the   participants   actually   disclosed  any\r               \n\nconfidential  information  at  the  Waltham meeting).2    And  he\n\napplied the  special intermediate  level of scrutiny  rather than\n\nthe more easily satisfied prima facie standard.\n\n          The district  court  granted  the  motion  to  dismiss.\n\nAfter  stressing  the importance  of the  Waltham meeting  to the\n\njurisdictional issue    BWC, after all, had no  other significant\n\ncontacts with the forum   Judge Stearns articulated two bases for\n\nrefusing to  exercise jurisdiction.  First, he  found it unlikely\n\neither  that proprietary  information had  been disclosed  at the\n\nmeeting  or that such information came into BWC's possession as a\n\nresult of the meeting;  therefore, FMI's cause of action  did not\n\narise  from BWC's participation in the meeting as required by the\n\nMassachusetts long-arm statute.   See Foster-Miller, 848 F. Supp.\r                                                             \n\nat 276-77.  Second, and alternatively,  the judge concluded that,\n\neven  if FMI's claims did  arise from BWC's  participation in the\n\nWaltham meeting,  it would  be unreasonable for  a Massachusetts-\n\nbased court to  exercise jurisdiction over  BWC, in part  because\n\nthe court might not be able to grant effective injunctive relief.\n\nSee id. at 277.\r                 \n\n          FMI moved for reconsideration, specifically withdrawing\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     2Because  the scope of this inquiry caught FMI off guard, it\ntendered a series of post-hearing offers of proof in an effort to\nmake  up lost ground.  We  do not comment on  the timing of FMI's\nproffers.    Further  proceedings   in  the  district  court  are\nobligatory,  see infra  Parts  IV(C)  &amp;  V,  at  which  time  new\r                                \nevidentiary submissions can be assembled.\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nits  prayer for an injunction.   Judge Stearns  denied the motion\n\nwithout comment.  This appeal ensued.\n\nIII.  SPECIFIC PERSONAL JURISDICTION\r          III.  SPECIFIC PERSONAL JURISDICTION\n\n          Prior to  reexamining the Boit  framework, we  rehearse\r                                                  \n\ncertain  general  principles  of  law  relating  to  specific  in\r                                                                           \n\npersonam jurisdiction.\r                  \n\n          Personal jurisdiction  implicates the power of  a court\n\nover a  defendant.  In a  federal court, both its  source and its\n\nouter limits are  defined exclusively by  the Constitution.   See\r                                                                           \n\nInsurance Corp. of  Ireland v. Compagnie des  Bauxites de Guinee,\r                                                                          \n\n456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982).\n\n          There are two  different avenues by  which a court  may\n\narrive at  personal jurisdiction.  One  frequently traveled route\n\nleads to general jurisdiction.  \"General jurisdiction exists when\n\nthe litigation is not directly founded  on the defendant's forum-\n\nbased  contacts, but  the defendant  has nevertheless  engaged in\n\ncontinuous and systematic activity, unrelated to the suit, in the\n\nforum  state.\"  United Elec.  Workers v. 163  Pleasant St. Corp.,\r                                                                          \n\n960  F.2d 1080,  1088 (1st Cir.  1992) (Pleasant  St. I).   Here,\r                                                                 \n\nBWC's forum-related  contacts are far  too scanty to  justify the\n\ninvocation of  general jurisdiction.   See Foster-Miller,  848 F.\r                                                                  \n\nSupp. at 273 (marshalling certain undisputed facts).\n\n          When  general  jurisdiction  is  lacking, the  lens  of\n\njudicial inquiry narrows to  focus on specific jurisdiction.   As\n\nthe  label  implies,  this  focus  requires  weighing  the  legal\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nsufficiency  of a  specific set  of interactions  as a  basis for\n\npersonal jurisdiction.  See  Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia,\r                                                                           \n\nS.A. v. Hall, 466  U.S. 408, 414-15 &amp; nn.8-9  (1984) (recognizing\r                      \n\n\"general\"  and \"specific\" jurisdiction and distinguishing between\n\nthem); Pleasant St. I,  960 F.2d at 1088 (similar);  Donatelli v.\r                                                                        \n\nNational Hockey  League, 893  F.2d 459,  462-63  (1st Cir.  1990)\r                                 \n\n(similar).   In  that  exercise,  the  applicable  constitutional\n\nlimits assume critical importance.  We explain briefly.\n\n          The existence of specific personal jurisdiction depends\n\nupon  the  plaintiff's   ability  to   satisfy  two   cornerstone\n\nconditions:  \"first, that the forum in which the federal district\n\ncourt  sits  has  a  long-arm  statute  that  purports  to  grant\n\njurisdiction over the defendant; and second, that the exercise of\n\njurisdiction  pursuant   to  that   statute  comports  with   the\n\nstrictures of the Constitution.\"  Pritzker v.

Its  language is\r               \n\nexpansive, and its words are to be generously applied in order to\n\ndetermine  whether a given defendant  fairly can be  said to have\n\nparticipated in the forum's  economic life.

The first    minimum contacts   is  not legitimately\n\nin issue.  The seminal jurisdictional fact   that BWC voluntarily\n\ndispatched  a  representative  to  Massachusetts  for  commercial\n\nadvantage  pursuant to  a written  contract with  a Massachusetts\n\nfirm      cannot  be  gainsaid.    In  taking  this  action,  BWC\n\npurposefully  conducted activities  in the  forum state,  thereby\n\nmaking  a suit foreseeable.  See id.  at 1089.  Hence, we endorse\r                                              \n\nthe district  court's conclusion that BWC  transacted business in\n\nMassachusetts to  such an  extent, and in  such a  manner, as  to\n\nsatisfy the minimum contacts requirement.  See Foster-Miller, 848\r                                                                      \n\nF.

In this\n\ncase, evaluating that requirement  reduces to whether FMI's claim\n\narises from BWC's  minimum contacts.   To place  this issue  into\n\nproper perspective, we  first limn the options that are available\n\nto a district court in  handling a motion to dismiss for  want of\n\njurisdiction  over the person.  We then refine that framework and\n\nscrutinize the decision below in light of our handiwork.\n\n       A.  Establishing and Testing Personal Jurisdiction.\r                 A.

But this is merely one step  along the path; to\n\nallocate the burden is neither to  define the evidentiary showing\n\nnecessary to meet it  nor to explain whether that  showing varies\n\nfrom context to context.\n\n          We addressed these important issues in Boit.  There, we\r                                                               \n\ntried  to formulate a procedural matrix that would serve to endow\n\nthe decisional  process with  appropriate degrees of  economy and\n\nmanageability.  That  endeavor produced a trio of standards, each\n\ncorresponding to  a  level of  analysis, that  might usefully  be\n\nemployed when  a trial  court comes  to  grips with  a motion  to\n\ndismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.\n\n          The  most  conventional of  these  methods  permits the\n\ndistrict  court  \"to  consider  only whether  the  plaintiff  has\n\nproffered  evidence  that,  if  credited, is  enough  to  support\n\nfindings of all facts essential to personal jurisdiction.\"  Boit,\r                                                                          \n\n967 F.2d at 675.  To make a prima  facie showing of this calibre,\n\nthe  plaintiff ordinarily cannot rest  upon the pleadings, but is\n\nobliged to adduce  evidence of specific facts.   See id.  Withal,\r                                                                  \n\nthe  district  court acts  not as  a  factfinder, but  as  a data\n\ncollector.  That is to say, the court, in a manner reminiscent of\n\nits role  when a motion for summary judgment is on the table, see\r                                                                           \n\n                                12\r\r\n\nFed.

Despite  the  lack of  differential factfinding,  this\n\ndevice is a useful means of screening out cases in which personal\n\njurisdiction  is  obviously  lacking,  and  those  in  which  the\n\njurisdictional  challenge   is  patently  bogus.    However,  the\n\napproach  offers  little  assistance  in  closer,  harder-to-call\n\ncases, particularly  those that  feature conflicting  versions of\n\nthe  facts.   See,  e.g., General  Contracting  &amp; Trading  Co. v.\r                                                                        \n\nInterpole, Inc., 899 F.2d 109 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                         \n\n          A  second option open  to the court  is to embark  on a\n\nfactfinding mission  in the traditional way,  taking evidence and\n\nmeasuring  the  plaintiff's  jurisdictional  showing   against  a\n\npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard.  In  Boit, we stated that\r                                                           \n\nthis standard may appropriately be invoked when a court\n\n          determine[s]  that in the  circumstances of a\n          particular case it is unfair to force an out-\n          of-state defendant  to incur the  expense and\n          burden of a trial on the merits  in the local\n          forum  without  first requiring  more  of the\n          plaintiff than a prima facie showing of facts\r                                                \n          essential to  in  personam jurisdiction.    A\r                                              \n          court may so determine, for example, when the\n          proffered  evidence  is  conflicting and  the\n          record is rife with contradictions, or when a\n          plaintiff's    affidavits    are    \"patently\n          incredible . . . .\"\n\nBoit,  967  F.2d  at  676  (offering  examples).    Virtually  by\r              \n\ndefinition, the preponderance standard necessitates  a full-blown\n\nevidentiary  hearing  at  which  the court  will  adjudicate  the\n\n                                13\r\r\n\njurisdictional  issue  definitively   before  the  case   reaches\n\ntrial.4   In that mode,  the court will  \"consider[] all relevant\n\nevidence proffered by the parties and mak[e] all factual findings\n\nessential  to disposition of the  motion.\"  Id.   But this method\r                                                         \n\nmust  be used discreetly.   For  one thing,  pretrial evidentiary\n\nhearings  are  relatively  cumbersome  creatures,  and,  if  used\n\nroutinely, can  squander judicial resources.   For another thing,\n\nsince  this  method  contemplates  a  binding  adjudication,  the\n\ncourt's  factual determinations  ordinarily will  have preclusive\n\neffect,  and, thus,  at least  in situations  in which  the facts\n\npertinent to jurisdiction  and the facts pertinent  to the merits\n\nare identical, or nearly so, profligate use of  the preponderance\n\nmethod can all too easily verge on a deprivation of  the right to\n\ntrial by jury.\n\n          In  Boit, we  recognized these  difficulties.   We also\r                            \n\nrecognized that the prima facie and preponderance-of-the-evidence\n\nstandards are  merely two  of several possible  models, and  that\n\ntrial  courts need  not  confine themselves  to choosing  between\n\nthese two  levels of evidentiary scrutiny.   See id. at  677.  In\r                                                              \n\nthe special  circumstance in which the  assertion of jurisdiction\n\nis  bound up  with the  claim on  the merits, the  possibility of\n\npreclusion renders  use of the preponderance  standard troubling,\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     4Such hearings  frequently are  convened under the  aegis of\nFed.

Utilizing this  intermediate standard, a district\n\ncourt, \"even though allowing  an evidentiary hearing and weighing\n\nevidence  to make  findings .  . .  may merely  find  whether the\n\nplaintiff  has shown a likelihood  of the existence  of each fact\n\nnecessary to support personal  jurisdiction.\"  Id.  This  showing\r                                                            \n\nconstitutes an assurance that  the circumstances justify imposing\n\non  a foreign defendant the burdens  of trial in a strange forum,\n\nbut  leaves to  the time  of trial  a  binding resolution  of the\n\nfactual disputes common to both the jurisdictional issue and  the\n\nmerits of the claim.  See id. at 678.\r                                       \n\n          Unlike  the   prima  facie   standard,  and  like   the\n\npreponderance  standard, this  third method,  which we  sometimes\n\ncall the \"likelihood standard,\"\n\n          involves   factfinding  rather   than  merely\n          making a ruling of law  regarding sufficiency\n          of  the evidence to  present a fact question.\n          Like the first and  unlike the second method,\n          however, the third method  avoids potentially\n          troubling  issues  of  \"issue preclusion\"  or\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n          \"law of  the case\"  (at least when  the court\n          denies the motion) because a determination by\n          such an intermediate standard  . . . does not\n          purport to be a  finding by the same standard\n          on  the  same issue  as  will  be decided  at\n          trial.\n\nId.\r             \n\n          We acknowledge that having an array of standards at the\n\nready  may be thought  too much of  a good thing.   However, even\n\nthough  an intermediate  standard  will not  be  used with  great\n\nfrequency,  the need for  one is  manifest.   We can  postulate a\n\nvariety of \"common facts\" scenarios in which  the facts necessary\n\nto  sustain personal  jurisdiction are  intimately bound  up with\n\nfacts necessary to establish the merits  of the underlying claim.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Ann  Althouse,  The  Use  of  Conspiracy  Theory  to\r                                                                           \n\nEstablish In Personam  Jurisdiction:  A Due  Process Analysis, 52\r                                                                       \n\nFordham L.

It is  precisely\n\nbecause of  the  incidence of  these situations    situations  in\n\nwhich the  issue of jurisdiction  is factually enmeshed  with the\n\nmerits  of the suit   that we  recognized in Boit the need for an\r                                                           \n\nintermediate  standard   of   proof  and,   correspondingly,   an\n\nintermediate standard of judicial analysis.\n\n                     B.

As a practical matter, the\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nstandard of review will  depend in the first instance  on whether\n\nthe  court of appeals is reviewing the district court's choice of\n\nan analytic method  or its application of such a  method.  As for\n\nthe court's initial choice from among the three standards we have\n\ndiscussed   prima facie, likelihood, or preponderance   appellate\n\nreview is de novo.  This accords with the  general principle that\n\na  trial court's determinations as to the legal rules that govern\n\na party's  proof, including  those that dictate  what quantum  of\n\nproof  the law  requires, are  subject to  plenary review.

Two considerations point to the applicability\n\nof this deferential mode of review in this situation.  First, the\n\nnature of a likelihood  analysis is such that it  falls naturally\n\nwithin the realm of discretionary decisionmaking.  Second, from a\n\npractical standpoint, a likelihood  analysis simply does not seem\n\namenable  to either of the  other standards.   Unlike the classic\n\nmotion  to  dismiss,  in  which the  plaintiff's  assertions  are\n\naccepted  as true, a  likelihood analysis  requires the  judge to\n\npass  upon   the  accuracy  and  integrity   of  the  plaintiff's\n\nassertions.  Yet, in  contrast to a preponderance-of-the-evidence\n\nanalysis, these determinations are not true findings of fact, for\n\nthey lack definiteness  to some  degree, and they  also lack  the\n\npreclusive   quality  that   would  otherwise   normally  attach.\n\nConsequently, we believe  that abuse of discretion  is the proper\n\nstandard of review.

See Foster-Miller, 848 F. Supp. at  276-77.  FMI\r                                            \n\nassigns error.  Its appeal raises potentially difficult questions\n\nabout the  application of  Boit's likelihood standard  in certain\r                                         \n\ntypes of cases.\n\n          We  hasten to note  that the paradigm  case   involving\n\nthe use of Boit's intermediate standard as a basis for exercising\r                                                                           \n\njurisdiction, i.e., as a basis for  denying a motion to dismiss  \r                                                     \n\nhardly seems problematic.   In such a scenario, the  plaintiff is\n\npermitted  to proceed in its  forum of choice,  yet the defendant\n\nhas  the   consolation  of   having  been  afforded   a  detailed\n\ndemonstration,  beyond a  mere prima  facie showing,  of why  the\n\ncourt  deems   it  fair   to  exercise  jurisdiction,   at  least\n\nprovisionally.   It is only  when Boit's intermediate standard is\r                                                \n\nused as a basis for declining the exercise of jurisdiction, i.e.,\r                                                                          \n\nas a basis for granting a motion to dismiss, that the prospect of\r                                 \n\nmischief  looms.   One  can easily  imagine  cases in  which  the\n\nlikelihood standard might be applied to adjudicate facts that are\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nonly  marginally related  to  jurisdiction, or  are very  closely\n\nrelated to the merits of the plaintiff's substantive claims, thus\n\nprematurely extinguishing a  plaintiff's ability  to present  its\n\ncase in a full and fair manner.5\n\n          The short of  it is  that, whatever its  merits in  the\n\nabstract,  Boit's intermediate  standard requires caution  in its\r                         \n\napplication,  especially when  it  appears that  a dismissal  may\n\nresult.  Indeed, although Boit does,  in dictum, 967 F.2d at 677-\r                                        \n\n78, propose to authorize such  dismissals, it is noteworthy that,\n\napart  from the  opinion of  the court  below, there is  no other\n\nreported  case, Boit  included, that  has sanctioned  a dismissal\r                              \n\npursuant to a district court's use of the likelihood standard.\n\n          In general, this is  as it should be.   To the  limited\n\nextent  that dismissals  under Boit's  intermediate  standard are\r                                             \n\njustified at all, they  will happen only rarely.   Even then, the\n\nexact  bounds  of  permissible  application  may  not  always  be\n\nevident.   Nonetheless, we believe  it is better  to tolerate the\n\ninconvenience of mild doctrinal  uncertainty rather than to forgo\n\naltogether the utility of an intermediate standard and method  of\n\nanalysis.

The bottom  line, clearly,  is  that judges  employing\n\nBoit's intermediate standard should proceed with great care.\r              \n\n          In   any  event,   these  potential   difficulties  are\n\nperipheral to the instant appeal.  In this instance, the  flaw is\n\nless  Judge  Stearns'  initial  decision to  switch  the  signals\n\npreviously  given   by  Judge   Keeton  and  instead   apply  the\n\nintermediate  standard,  but  more  his failure  to  apprise  FMI\n\nsquarely  of this change of plan    a failure that was aggravated\n\nby FMI's inability to engage in appropriate discovery and then to\n\npresent  the totality  of its  evidence within  the context  of a\n\nlikelihood analysis.\n\n          When  judges  elect  on  their own  initiative  to  use\n\ninnovative methods in an  effort to accelerate the progress  of a\n\ncase,  they  must take  pains to  ensure  that parties  are given\n\nsatisfactory  notice,  reasonable  access  to  discovery,  and  a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to present evidence.  See, e.g., Stella v.\r                                                                        \n\nTown  of Tewksbury,  4 F.3d  53, 55-56  (1st Cir.  1993) (stating\r                            \n\nthese principles in the context of sua  sponte summary judgment);\r                                                        \n\nJardines  Bacata, Ltd.  v.

While the  likelihood standard  has\n\nvalue,   the  latent  risks  associated  with  its  use  are  not\n\n                                21\r\r\n\ninsignificant,  and  they should  be  ameliorated  to the  extent\n\npracticable.\n\n          Here, the  lower court did  not afford FMI  the process\n\nthat was due.   To be  sure, Judge Stearns  advised counsel at  a\n\nstatus  conference on January 20, 1994, that he was pondering the\n\nuse of the likelihood standard, but he neither eased the existing\n\nrestriction  on  discovery  nor superseded  Judge  Keeton's prior\n\ndirectives.    The  prima  facie standard  remained  the  default\n\nsetting,  and   Judge  Stearns'   intentions  remained   open  to\n\nconjecture until the day of the hearing.  Indeed, while the court\n\ntransmitted mixed signals  to some degree, it  closed the January\n\n20  conference by  specifically announcing  that the  question of\n\nmisappropriation would  not be subject to  anything more rigorous\r                                     \n\nthan scrutiny under a prima facie standard.  On this point, Judge\n\nStearns'  intention could not have  been more explicit.   He told\n\nthe lawyers:  \"I am going to, for purposes of this hearing, . . .\n\nbasically  accept whatever [FMI] allege[s] to be true in terms of\n\nthe misappropriation.\"\n\n          Following this pronouncement, the court never gave  the\n\nlitigants  suitable forewarning of a  change of heart,  or of the\n\nextent  to  which it  would apply  the  likelihood standard.   To\n\nunderstand  the  gravity of  this  omission, it  is  important to\n\nunderstand the restriction imposed  on discovery by Judge Keeton,\n\nand how that restriction  arose.  On December 15, 1993, FMI moved\n\n\"to examine the documents  and other materials maintained  by BWC\n\nwhich  would be relevant to  statements in the  affidavits of Mr.\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nSt. Louis  and others  concerning contacts with,  statements made\n\nby,  and other information received  from Foster-Miller .  . . .\"\n\nBWC  objected.   The  next day  Judge  Keeton, ruling  ore tenus,\r                                                                          \n\nrestricted  FMI's  discovery  to  matters  \"bear[ing]   upon  the\n\njurisdictional issue.\"  All other  discovery, he ruled, was  \"out\n\nof bounds\"  for the time  being.  We think  that this limitation,\n\ncoupled with  the judge's  simultaneous indication that  he would\n\nevaluate  the motion to  dismiss under the  prima facie standard,\n\neffectively  prevented   FMI  from  engaging   in  merits-related\n\ndiscovery.  And when Judge Stearns then shifted abruptly from the\n\nforecasted prima facie standard  to the more intrusive likelihood\n\nstandard, the preexisting restriction    which remained intact on\n\nJudge Stearns' watch   hamstrung FMI.6\n\n            Since   this    imperfect   communication   obviously\n\nprejudiced  FMI's  ability  fairly to  meet  the  rigors  that an\n\nacross-the-board use  of the  likelihood standard imposed  in the\n\ncircumstances of  this  case,  we  must  set  aside  the  court's\n\nconclusion that FMI's suit did  not \"arise from\" BWC's activities\n\nin the  forum state.  To  that extent, then, the  dismissal order\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     6This  is  because  the   two  standards  involve   markedly\ndifferent quanta  of proof.   So long  as a prima  facie standard\nobtained, FMI had neither a right nor a reason, in  the course of\n\"jurisdictional  discovery,\" to  ferret  out all  the  supporting\nevidence  regarding  the confidential  nature  of  what had  been\ndiscussed in Waltham.  By the same token, it had  neither a right\nnor a reason  to document  fully the allegedly  improper uses  of\nsuch  confidences by  BWC.    But once  the  court  shifted to  a\nlikelihood  standard,   the  scope,  tenor  and   degree  of  the\nprospective inquiry changed, and  FMI was caught, like a  fawn in\nthe headlights of a speeding van, without the discovery it needed\nto prove its point.\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nsuccumbs.\n\nV.

In addition  to\n\nholding that  FMI's  claim  did not  arise  from  BWC's  in-forum\n\ncontacts, the  district court held, alternatively,  that it would\n\nbe unreasonable to exercise  jurisdiction over BWC.

Since the rapid-fire shift\n\nof standards probably  tainted this conclusion as  well, we could\n\nsimply  vacate the  alternative  holding.

We have tended to  channel the quest for that imperative\n\nthrough a  template that  highlights five  factors.

Their primary\n\nfunction  is simply to  illuminate the equitable  dimensions of a\n\nspecific situation,  thereby \"put[ting] into  sharper perspective\n\nthe  reasonableness  and   fundamental  fairness  of   exercising\n\njurisdiction\" in that situation.

See Foster-Miller,  848 F. Supp.  at\r                                                        \n\n277.  The court  then invoked a sixth  factor   the ability of  a\n\nCanadian  court  to  apply   Massachusetts  law  competently  and\n\nimpartially   and concluded that even if \"some harm had flowed to\n\nFoster-Miller  from  the Waltham  meeting,\"  the  suit should  be\n\ndismissed based on \"considerations of due process.\"  Id.\r                                                                  \n\n          The  district court's  analysis is  flawed.   First and\n\nforemost, the  court's added consideration    the absence  of any\n\nreason to believe  that a  Canadian court would  display bias  or\n\nprove incapable of applying  Massachusetts law   has no  place in\n\nthe minimum contacts calculus.   Though the five gestalt  factors\n\nshould not necessarily  be deemed  collectively exhaustive,  see,\r                                                                          \n\ne.g., FDIC v.

Goldcorp  Invs.,\r                                                                           \nLtd., 946 F.2d 944 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.

Second,  we are  unable  to discern  a link\nbetween the judge's hosannas to the Canadian court system and his\nconclusion that a federal district court sitting in Massachusetts\nlacks jurisdiction.  Assuming that neither of two courts poses an\nundue  risk  of  biased  or incompetent  adjudication,  there  is\nnothing  to  be counted  against either  of  them in  working the\njurisdictional calculus.\n\n                                26\r\r\n\npositions,  likely influenced  by  its mistaken  blending of  the\n\ntheories of  personal jurisdiction  and forum non  conveniens, in\r                                                                       \n\nthe  course of  ascertaining  that the  second and  third gestalt\n\nfactors  militated against  the  exercise of  jurisdiction.   For\n\nexample,  the court deviated from the thrust of the second factor\n\nby  centering much of its discussion on \"the implications of this\n\nlitigation  for  a Canadian  industry upon  whom [sic]  an entire\n\npopulation depends for electric power\" and on the extent to which\n\nCanada's  interests  \"dwarf\"  those of  Massachusetts.

This  emphasis  distorts  the\r                \n\ndirective that a court pondering the second factor must mull \"the\n\nforum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute,\" Pleasant St.\r                                                                           \n\nI,  960 F.2d  at 1088.   The  purpose of  the inquiry  is not  to\r           \n\ncompare the forum's interest to that of  some other jurisdiction,\r                 \n\nbut to determine the  extent to which the forum  has an interest.\r                                                              \n\nSee, e.g., Burger King, 471 U.S.  at 483 &amp; n.26 (flatly rejecting\r                                \n\nthe notion that a  non-forum state's \"acknowledged interest might\n\npossibly render jurisdiction in [the forum] unconstitutional\" and\r                                                                      \n\nobserving that \"minimum-contacts analysis presupposes that two or\n\nmore States may be interested in the outcome of a dispute\").\n\n          The district  court's analysis  is equally awry  in its\n\ntreatment  of  the  third   gestalt  factor  (which  requires  an\n\nassessment of  \"the plaintiff's interest in  obtaining convenient\n\nand  effective relief,\"  Pleasant  St.  I,  960  F.2d  at  1088).\r                                                   \n\nAlthough finding that \"it is more convenient for the plaintiff to\n\nlitigate this matter in  domestic comfort,\" Foster-Miller, 848 F.\r                                                                   \n\n                                27\r\r\n\nSupp.  at 277, the court  offset this finding  by invoking, inter\r                                                                           \n\nalia, a presumed  inability \"to award plaintiff  the full measure\r              \n\nof  relief that it seeks\"  because of doubts  concerning both the\n\npropriety and the  efficacy of enjoining a foreign national whose\n\npresence in Massachusetts had  been fleeting.  Id.   This concern\r                                                            \n\nis  beside any  relevant point  where a plaintiff's  inability to\n\nobtain  certain kinds  of relief is  wholly a product  of her own\n\nchoice  of forum.   At  any rate,  the plaintiff  here explicitly\n\ninformed the court of its  willingness to forgo injunctive relief\n\nif necessary to salvage jurisdiction.\n\n          We  have  another  problem  with  the district  court's\n\nassessment of  the third gestalt  factor.   The court  downplayed\n\nFMI's convenience  because the  company \"does business  in Canada\n\nand  is represented  by presumably  capable  Canadian attorneys.\"\n\nId.   Putting this  spin on  the  matter    emphasizing that  the\r             \n\nplaintiff could just  as easily  litigate in a  Canadian court   \n\neffectively nullifies the plaintiff's choice to litigate its suit\n\nnot in Canada but in Massachusetts.  Though such judicial second-\r             \n\nguessing may  be proper in deciding  transfer-of-venue motions or\n\nwhen the plaintiff's  supposed convenience \"seems  to be . .  . a\n\nmakeweight,\"  contrived purely  for  strategic advantage,  courts\n\nconsidering  jurisdictional  issues   generally  should   \"accord\n\nplaintiff's choice of forum  a degree of deference in  respect to\n\nthe issue of its own convenience . . . .\"   Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d\r                                                                  \n\nat 211.  So it is here.\n\n          We  will not comment on the lower court's assessment of\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nthe first, fourth, and fifth gestalt factors.  It is evident from\n\nwhat we have written  to this point that  the order of  dismissal\n\ncannot   plausibly   rest   on   the   existing   assessment   of\n\nreasonableness.\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r          VI.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  have come full circle, back to our beginnings.  The\n\nBoit framework is an expression of  pragmatism   an authoritative\r              \n\nrecognition,  informed  both by  experience  and  by the  demands\n\nplaced  on  the federal  bench, that  it  is desirable  for trial\n\njudges,  when  feasible,  to  give  meaningful,  yet  not  unduly\n\nburdensome, scrutiny to the question of jurisdiction at the early\n\nstages of particular types of cases.  The pragmatic nature of the\n\nframework requires courts to proceed with caution, mindful of the\n\nrisks  of overapplication and of  the need to  give parties ample\n\nnotice and opportunity to demonstrate that jurisdiction is, or is\n\nnot,  proper.  In the case at  hand, the district court failed to\n\nprovide  these  latter  necessities  to  FMI.    The  court  then\n\ncompounded   its  error  by   weighing  extraneous   elements  in\n\nattempting  to strike a balance on reasonableness.  Thus, we find\n\nmerit in FMI's appeal.\n\n          We  need go  no  further.    We  vacate  the  order  of\n\ndismissal.   On  remand,  the district  court  should  alert  the\n\nparties in advance to the level of scrutiny that it will apply to\n\nthe  pending motion  and  the  factual  questions  to  which  the\n\nstandard  will pertain.  The court should also allow such further\n\ndiscovery,   if  any,  as  may  be  desirable  in  light  of  its\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nintentions.  At  the appropriate juncture,  the court may  accept\n\nsubmissions  in such  form  as  it  deems  proper  and  make  its\n\ndetermination  on relatedness.    If the  court  deems the  basic\n\njurisdictional  tests  satisfied,  it  should  then  undertake  a\n\nreasonableness analysis  that comports with our  precedents.8  We\n\ntake  no view  on  the ultimate  resolution of  the issues  to be\n\naddressed on remand,  or on  the proper weighing  of the  gestalt\n\nfactors.  Our concern at this stage is primarily with the court's\n\nmethodology.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.  Costs in favor of appellant.\r                    Vacated and remanded.

Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671 (1st Cir.1992), we urged district courts to take a flexible approach in handling motions to dismiss for lack of in personam jurisdiction, and, concomitantly, to tailor procedures for use in those purlieus.  Turning from the general to the particular, we recommended that district courts employ varying levels of scrutiny in connection with such motions, adapting the level of scrutiny to the exigencies of the individual case.  See id. at 674-78.   Among other possibilities, we suggested using a special intermediate standard when \"factual issues are common to both the jurisdictional question and the claim on the merits....\"  Id. at 677.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case before us today--an appeal by Foster-Miller, Inc.  (FMI) from an order dismissing its commercial tort action against Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada (BWC)--illustrates vividly that Boit 's flexible approach demands circumspection in its application.  In this case, the district court applied Boit 's intermediate standard too rashly when, eager to test whether a legally sufficient showing of jurisdiction had been made, it neither gave the parties adequate notice that it intended to use this special standard nor ensured that FMI had a fair opportunity to gather and present the evidence necessary for such a showing.  While we are not without sympathy for the district judge--he inherited this case midstream, and Boit, in retrospect, should have emphasized the need to forewarn litigants of a trial court's intention to go beyond the prima facie standard typically associated with motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2)--we cannot permit the dismissal order to stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the operative facts, drawing liberally from the lower court's opinion.  See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Can., 848 F.Supp. 271 (D.Mass.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties to this appeal are quondam competitors:  FMI is a Massachusetts corporation engaged in furnishing sludge and particle removal services for nuclear steam generators;  BWC is a Canadian firm that, among other things, services such generators.  At its core, the litigation concerns a virtual meltdown of the parties' relationship, which in turn detonated a lawsuit.  The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As early as 1988, FMI and BWC entertained the prospect of a joint venture to furnish sludge removal services to Ontario Hydro, a Canadian utility.  Although the joint venture idea stalled and the principals went their separate ways, Canada remained an alluring target.  But the road to prosperity had a large pothole.  FMI's then-extant technology, known by the acronym \"CECIL,\" featured flexible lances that directed powerful bursts of water at pockets of sludge found within the hard-to-reach crannies of nuclear steam boilers.  While this system had distinct competitive advantages over BWC's rival rigid lance system, neither system performed satisfactorily in the cleansing of Canadian boilers (known in the trade as Candu boilers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determined to detour around the \"can't do Candu\" pothole and penetrate the Canadian market, BWC set out to design a lance of unprecedented flexibility.  In 1989, while BWC's development efforts were underway, Ontario Hydro (acting on behalf of a consortium of Canadian utilities) retained FMI to study the feasibility of adapting FMI's flexible lance technology for use in Candu boilers.  As part of this endeavor, FMI contracted with a well-known supplier, U.S. Composites (CompCo), to create a new type of hose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990, Robert A.S. Lee, an FMI employee who had been instrumental in perfecting CECIL, attended an industry conference in Tennessee.  Daniel St. Louis, a BWC engineer involved in that company's push to fashion a flexible lance, attended the same session.  During a previous encounter, the men had casually discussed high pressure hoses.  On this occasion, their conversation became more detailed and focused on the possibility of reinforcing high pressure hoses with certain fibers.  The discussion proved prophetic:  a few weeks thereafter, CompCo delivered the special hose that FMI had asked it to design.  The hose was thought in certain quarters to represent a technological breakthrough.  One of its more revolutionary features was a double-layered Kevlar sheath that supplied desired reinforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 1990, an Ontario Hydro representative, James Malaugh, traveled to FMI's plant in Waltham, Massachusetts, to assess FMI's progress.  Seeking expertise and insight, Malaugh invited St. Louis to join him.  Nonplussed, FMI allowed St. Louis to attend only after BWC signed a confidentiality agreement.  The agreement, duly executed by a ranking official of BWC and transmitted via facsimile machine from Canada, acknowledged that FMI \"anticipate[d] disclosing ... certain information of a novel, proprietary, or confidential nature,\" and memorialized BWC's promise \"not to use [the] information for any purpose unless specifically authorized in writing by FMI.\"   The agreement also stipulated that FMI would be entitled to relief for any breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Leary, the FMI engineer in charge of the Ontario Hydro project, hosted the Waltham session.  The participants debated various aspects of flexible lance technology, including the preferred characteristics of the hose and possible methods of reinforcement.  At one point Leary, responding to a direct question by St. Louis, identified CompCo as FMI's supplier.  Not long after the Waltham meeting, St. Louis contacted CompCo and inquired about the possibility of that company fabricating a similar hose for BWC.  St. Louis' suggestion that FMI would not object proved overly sanguine; after consulting with FMI, CompCo rebuffed BWC's overtures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undaunted, BWC forged ahead in its research effort.  It eventually succeeded in manufacturing its own flexible lance, suitable for Candu boilers.  Thereafter, Ontario Hydro awarded BWC a lucrative contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE LITIGATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 12, 1993, FMI, claiming to have gotten hosed, commenced suit against BWC in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), FMI charged breach of the confidentiality agreement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and unfair competition.  BWC moved to dismiss for lack of in personam jurisdiction or, in the alternative, on the basis of forum non conveniens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Keeton drew the case.  Concerns about the parties' trade secrets slowed discovery to a crawl.  At a conference held on December 16, 1993, Judge Keeton scheduled a hearing on the motion for January 4, 1994, restricted discovery for the time being to matters \"bear[ing] upon the jurisdictional issue,\" and advised counsel that, absent an agreement dissolving the discovery deadlock, he would use the traditional prima facie standard, not the special intermediate standard, in evaluating the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, fate intervened.  In a routine shuffling of cases ancillary to the appointment of several new judicial officers, this case was plucked from Judge Keeton and reassigned to Judge Stearns.  The January 4 hearing never materialized.  Instead, Judge Stearns heard the motion to dismiss on February 1 and 2, 1994.  Though the discovery dispute had not been resolved, Judge Stearns, to FMI's obvious chagrin, undertook not only to probe the existence of the basic facts on which jurisdiction might be premised but also to adjudicate certain ultimate facts (e.g., whether the participants actually disclosed any confidential information at the Waltham meeting).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  And he applied the special intermediate level of scrutiny rather than the more easily satisfied prima facie standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion to dismiss.  After stressing the importance of the Waltham meeting to the jurisdictional issue--BWC, after all, had no other significant contacts with the forum--Judge Stearns articulated two bases for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.  First, he found it unlikely either that proprietary information had been disclosed at the meeting or that such information came into BWC's possession as a result of the meeting;  therefore, FMI's cause of action did not arise from BWC's participation in the meeting as required by the Massachusetts long-arm statute.  See Foster-Miller, 848 F.Supp. at 276-77.   Second, and alternatively, the judge concluded that, even if FMI's claims did arise from BWC's participation in the Waltham meeting, it would be unreasonable for a Massachusetts-based court to exercise jurisdiction over BWC, in part because the court might not be able to grant effective injunctive relief.  See id. at 277.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FMI moved for reconsideration, specifically withdrawing its prayer for an injunction.  Judge Stearns denied the motion without comment.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. SPECIFIC PERSONAL JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to reexamining the Boit framework, we rehearse certain general principles of law relating to specific in personam jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Personal jurisdiction implicates the power of a court over a defendant.  In a federal court, both its source and its outer limits are defined exclusively by the Constitution.  See Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 2104, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two different avenues by which a court may arrive at personal jurisdiction.  One frequently traveled route leads to general jurisdiction.  \"General jurisdiction exists when the litigation is not directly founded on the defendant's forum-based contacts, but the defendant has nevertheless engaged in continuous and systematic activity, unrelated to the suit, in the forum state.\"  United Elec. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1088 (1st Cir.1992) (Pleasant St. I ).   Here, BWC's forum-related contacts are far too scanty to justify the invocation of general jurisdiction.  See Foster-Miller, 848 F.Supp. at 273 (marshalling certain undisputed facts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When general jurisdiction is lacking, the lens of judicial inquiry narrows to focus on specific jurisdiction.  As the label implies, this focus requires weighing the legal sufficiency of a specific set of interactions as a basis for personal jurisdiction.  See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414-15 &amp; nn. 8-9, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 1872 &amp; nn. 8-9, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984) (recognizing \"general\" and \"specific\" jurisdiction and distinguishing between them);  Pleasant St. I, 960 F.2d at 1088 (similar);  Donatelli v. National Hockey League, 893 F.2d 459, 462-63 (1st Cir.1990) (similar).  In that exercise, the applicable constitutional limits assume critical importance.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existence of specific personal jurisdiction depends upon the plaintiff's ability to satisfy two cornerstone conditions:  \"first, that the forum in which the federal district court sits has a long-arm statute that purports to grant jurisdiction over the defendant;  and second, that the exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to that statute comports with the strictures of the Constitution.\"  Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir.1994);  see also Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir.1994);  Hahn v. Vermont Law Sch., 698 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we deem the first of the cornerstone conditions to be self-explanatory, the second condition requires amplification.  This condition implicates three distinct components, namely, relatedness, purposeful availment (sometimes called \"minimum contacts\"), and reasonableness:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>First, the claim underlying the litigation must directly arise out of, or relate to, the defendant's forum-state activities.  Second, the defendant's in-state contacts must represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable.  Third, the exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pleasant St. I, 960 F.2d at 1089;  accord Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 60-61;  Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 206.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. APPLYING THE JURISDICTIONAL RULES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A long-arm statute is plainly available for FMI's use.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 223A, Sec. 3(a) (1992).  Section 3(a), quoted supra note 3, is not modest in its reach.  Its language is expansive, and its words are to be generously applied in order to determine whether a given defendant fairly can be said to have participated in the forum's economic life.  See Pleasant St. I, 960 F.2d at 1087 (collecting cases).  Since section 3(a) applies here, we turn directly to the second of the two cornerstone conditions that constitute the foundation for a finding of specific in personam jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, the condition comprises three components.  The first--minimum contacts--is not legitimately in issue.  The seminal jurisdictional fact--that BWC voluntarily dispatched a representative to Massachusetts for commercial advantage pursuant to a written contract with a Massachusetts firm--cannot be gainsaid.  In taking this action, BWC purposefully conducted activities in the forum state, thereby making a suit foreseeable.  See id. at 1089.   Hence, we endorse the district court's conclusion that BWC transacted business in Massachusetts to such an extent, and in such a manner, as to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement.  See Foster-Miller, 848 F.Supp. at 276;  compare Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 62 (finding jurisdiction in part because the nonresident defendant, by contract, had \"knowingly acquir[ed] an economically beneficial interest\" in a forum-based commercial venture).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Setting the matter of minimum contacts to rest, we come face to face with the next component:  relatedness.  In this case, evaluating that requirement reduces to whether FMI's claim arises from BWC's minimum contacts.  To place this issue into proper perspective, we first limn the options that are available to a district court in handling a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction over the person.  We then refine that framework and scrutinize the decision below in light of our handiwork.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>A. Establishing and Testing Personal Jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apodictic that the plaintiff, who bears the burden of proving the existence of in personam jurisdiction, must carry the devoir of persuasion on the elements of relatedness and minimum contacts.  See Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 207 n. 9;  Martel v. Stafford, 992 F.2d 1244, 1247 n. 5 (1st Cir.1993);  Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 468.   But this is merely one step along the path;  to allocate the burden is neither to define the evidentiary showing necessary to meet it nor to explain whether that showing varies from context to context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We addressed these important issues in Boit.   There, we tried to formulate a procedural matrix that would serve to endow the decisional process with appropriate degrees of economy and manageability.  That endeavor produced a trio of standards, each corresponding to a level of analysis, that might usefully be employed when a trial court comes to grips with a motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most conventional of these methods permits the district court \"to consider only whether the plaintiff has proffered evidence that, if credited, is enough to support findings of all facts essential to personal jurisdiction.\"  Boit, 967 F.2d at 675.   To make a prima facie showing of this calibre, the plaintiff ordinarily cannot rest upon the pleadings, but is obliged to adduce evidence of specific facts.  See id.   Withal, the district court acts not as a factfinder, but as a data collector.  That is to say, the court, in a manner reminiscent of its role when a motion for summary judgment is on the table, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), must accept the plaintiff's (properly documented) evidentiary proffers as true for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the prima facie jurisdictional showing.  Despite the lack of differential factfinding, this device is a useful means of screening out cases in which personal jurisdiction is obviously lacking, and those in which the jurisdictional challenge is patently bogus.  However, the approach offers little assistance in closer, harder-to-call cases, particularly those that feature conflicting versions of the facts.  See, e.g., General Contracting &amp; Trading Co. v. Interpole, Inc., 899 F.2d 109 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second option open to the court is to embark on a factfinding mission in the traditional way, taking evidence and measuring the plaintiff's jurisdictional showing against a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.  In Boit, we stated that this standard may appropriately be invoked when a court</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>determine[s] that in the circumstances of a particular case it is unfair to force an out-of-state defendant to incur the expense and burden of a trial on the merits in the local forum without first requiring more of the plaintiff than a prima facie showing of facts essential to in personam jurisdiction.  A court may so determine, for example, when the proffered evidence is conflicting and the record is rife with contradictions, or when a plaintiff's affidavits are \"patently incredible....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boit, 967 F.2d at 676 (offering examples).  Virtually by definition, the preponderance standard necessitates a full-blown evidentiary hearing at which the court will adjudicate the jurisdictional issue definitively before the case reaches trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In that mode, the court will \"consider[ ] all relevant evidence proffered by the parties and mak[e] all factual findings essential to disposition of the motion.\"  Id.  But this method must be used discreetly.  For one thing, pretrial evidentiary hearings are relatively cumbersome creatures, and, if used routinely, can squander judicial resources.  For another thing, since this method contemplates a binding adjudication, the court's factual determinations ordinarily will have preclusive effect, and, thus, at least in situations in which the facts pertinent to jurisdiction and the facts pertinent to the merits are identical, or nearly so, profligate use of the preponderance method can all too easily verge on a deprivation of the right to trial by jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Boit, we recognized these difficulties.  We also recognized that the prima facie and preponderance-of-the-evidence standards are merely two of several possible models, and that trial courts need not confine themselves to choosing between these two levels of evidentiary scrutiny.  See id. at 677.   In the special circumstance in which the assertion of jurisdiction is bound up with the claim on the merits, the possibility of preclusion renders use of the preponderance standard troubling, while the possibility of permitting a dubious case to proceed beyond the pleading stage, and even to trial, though the court eventually will be found to lack jurisdiction, renders use of the prima facie standard undesirable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Boit panel anticipated that, when this special circumstance arose, trial courts might steer a middle course by engaging in some differential factfinding, limited to probable outcomes as opposed to definitive findings of fact, thereby skirting potential preclusionary problems while at the same time enhancing the courts' ability to weed out unfounded claims of jurisdiction.  Utilizing this intermediate standard, a district court, \"even though allowing an evidentiary hearing and weighing evidence to make findings ... may merely find whether the plaintiff has shown a likelihood of the existence of each fact necessary to support personal jurisdiction.\"  Id.  This showing constitutes an assurance that the circumstances justify imposing on a foreign defendant the burdens of trial in a strange forum, but leaves to the time of trial a binding resolution of the factual disputes common to both the jurisdictional issue and the merits of the claim.  See id. at 678.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the prima facie standard, and like the preponderance standard, this third method, which we sometimes call the \"likelihood standard,\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>involves factfinding rather than merely making a ruling of law regarding sufficiency of the evidence to present a fact question.  Like the first and unlike the second method, however, the third method avoids potentially troubling issues of \"issue preclusion\" or \"law of the case\" (at least when the court denies the motion) because a determination by such an intermediate standard ... does not purport to be a finding by the same standard on the same issue as will be decided at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that having an array of standards at the ready may be thought too much of a good thing.  However, even though an intermediate standard will not be used with great frequency, the need for one is manifest.  We can postulate a variety of \"common facts\" scenarios in which the facts necessary to sustain personal jurisdiction are intimately bound up with facts necessary to establish the merits of the underlying claim.  See, e.g., Ann Althouse, The Use of Conspiracy Theory to Establish In Personam Jurisdiction:  A Due Process Analysis, 52 Fordham L.Rev. 234, 247-51 (1983) (noting, though not adequately resolving, the problem created in situations where proving the facts \"upon which jurisdiction depends is viewed as inextricably tied to the substantive merits of the case\").  It is precisely because of the incidence of these situations--situations in which the issue of jurisdiction is factually enmeshed with the merits of the suit--that we recognized in Boit the need for an intermediate standard of proof and, correspondingly, an intermediate standard of judicial analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>B. Standards of Review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are reluctant to end our discussion of the methods available to district courts for testing jurisdictional waters without mentioning appellate review.  As a practical matter, the standard of review will depend in the first instance on whether the court of appeals is reviewing the district court's choice of an analytic method or its application of such a method.  As for the court's initial choice from among the three standards we have discussed--prima facie, likelihood, or preponderance--appellate review is de novo.  This accords with the general principle that a trial court's determinations as to the legal rules that govern a party's proof, including those that dictate what quantum of proof the law requires, are subject to plenary review.  See, e.g., Putnam Resources v. Pateman, 958 F.2d 448, 471 (1st Cir.1992);  see also Soto v. United States, 11 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that \"if a district court applie[s] an erroneous legal standard to the facts,\" de novo review obtains).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the district court's subsequent application of the method that it chooses, the standard of review will vary from method to method.  If the district court employs the prima facie standard, then appellate review is de novo.  See United Elec. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 987 F.2d 39, 44 (1st Cir.1993) (Pleasant St. II );  Boit, 967 F.2d at 675;  see also Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that appellate courts traditionally review rulings on motions to dismiss de novo, \"applying the same criteria that obtained in the court below\").  If the district court departs from the conventional method of adjudicating motions to dismiss and relies upon the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard to determine the existence vel non of personal jurisdiction, then appellate review is for clear error.  See CutCo Indus., Inc. v. Naughton, 806 F.2d 361, 364-65 (2d Cir.1986);  see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court employs the intermediate standard, then appellate review is for abuse of discretion.  Cf. Boit, 967 F.2d at 678 (suggesting a deferential standard of appellate review).  Two considerations point to the applicability of this deferential mode of review in this situation.  First, the nature of a likelihood analysis is such that it falls naturally within the realm of discretionary decisionmaking.  Second, from a practical standpoint, a likelihood analysis simply does not seem amenable to either of the other standards.  Unlike the classic motion to dismiss, in which the plaintiff's assertions are accepted as true, a likelihood analysis requires the judge to pass upon the accuracy and integrity of the plaintiff's assertions.  Yet, in contrast to a preponderance-of-the-evidence analysis, these determinations are not true findings of fact, for they lack definiteness to some degree, and they also lack the preclusive quality that would otherwise normally attach.  Consequently, we believe that abuse of discretion is the proper standard of review.  In practical terms, this means that we will set aside the challenged ruling only if we descry \"a meaningful error in judgment.\"  Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir.1988);  accord Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon, 889 F.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, whatever method is chosen and however it may be applied, appellate review of the trial court's legal conclusions about whether its findings do--or do notsupport the exercise of in personam jurisdiction is always nondeferential and plenary.  See Boit, 967 F.2d at 678.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>C. Applying the Likelihood Standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After convening an evidentiary hearing and bringing the likelihood standard to bear, Judge Stearns found it unlikely either that FMI disclosed legally protected information at the Waltham meeting or that BWC obtained confidences as a consequence of the meeting.  See Foster-Miller, 848 F.Supp. at 276-77.   FMI assigns error.  Its appeal raises potentially difficult questions about the application of Boit 's likelihood standard in certain types of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to note that the paradigm case--involving the use of Boit 's intermediate standard as a basis for exercising jurisdiction, i.e., as a basis for denying a motion to dismiss--hardly seems problematic.  In such a scenario, the plaintiff is permitted to proceed in its forum of choice, yet the defendant has the consolation of having been afforded a detailed demonstration, beyond a mere prima facie showing, of why the court deems it fair to exercise jurisdiction, at least provisionally.  It is only when Boit 's intermediate standard is used as a basis for declining the exercise of jurisdiction, i.e., as a basis for granting a motion to dismiss, that the prospect of mischief looms.  One can easily imagine cases in which the likelihood standard might be applied to adjudicate facts that are only marginally related to jurisdiction, or are very closely related to the merits of the plaintiff's substantive claims, thus prematurely extinguishing a plaintiff's ability to present its case in a full and fair manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, whatever its merits in the abstract, Boit 's intermediate standard requires caution in its application, especially when it appears that a dismissal may result.  Indeed, although Boit does, in dictum, 967 F.2d at 677-78, propose to authorize such dismissals, it is noteworthy that, apart from the opinion of the court below, there is no other reported case, Boit included, that has sanctioned a dismissal pursuant to a district court's use of the likelihood standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, this is as it should be.  To the limited extent that dismissals under Boit 's intermediate standard are justified at all, they will happen only rarely.  Even then, the exact bounds of permissible application may not always be evident.  Nonetheless, we believe it is better to tolerate the inconvenience of mild doctrinal uncertainty rather than to forgo altogether the utility of an intermediate standard and method of analysis.  See generally Stephen L. Carter, Constitutional Adjudication and the Indeterminate Text:  A Preliminary Defense of an Imperfect Muddle, 94 Yale L.J. 821 (1985) (recognizing the impossibility of removing all uncertainty from legal doctrine);  Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Path of the Law, 10 Harv.L.Rev. 457, 465 (1897) (warning that, in respect to judicial decisions, \"certainty generally is illusion, and repose is not the destiny of man\").  The bottom line, clearly, is that judges employing Boit 's intermediate standard should proceed with great care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, these potential difficulties are peripheral to the instant appeal.  In this instance, the flaw is less Judge Stearns' initial decision to switch the signals previously given by Judge Keeton and instead apply the intermediate standard, but more his failure to apprise FMI squarely of this change of plan--a failure that was aggravated by FMI's inability to engage in appropriate discovery and then to present the totality of its evidence within the context of a likelihood analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When judges elect on their own initiative to use innovative methods in an effort to accelerate the progress of a case, they must take pains to ensure that parties are given satisfactory notice, reasonable access to discovery, and a meaningful opportunity to present evidence.  See, e.g., Stella v. Town of Tewksbury, 4 F.3d 53, 55-56 (1st Cir.1993) (stating these principles in the context of sua sponte summary judgment);  Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v. Diaz-Marquez, 878 F.2d 1555, 1560-61 (1st Cir.1989) (similar).  While the likelihood standard has value, the latent risks associated with its use are not insignificant, and they should be ameliorated to the extent practicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the lower court did not afford FMI the process that was due.  To be sure, Judge Stearns advised counsel at a status conference on January 20, 1994, that he was pondering the use of the likelihood standard, but he neither eased the existing restriction on discovery nor superseded Judge Keeton's prior directives.  The prima facie standard remained the default setting, and Judge Stearns' intentions remained open to conjecture until the day of the hearing.  Indeed, while the court transmitted mixed signals to some degree, it closed the January 20 conference by specifically announcing that the question of misappropriation would not be subject to anything more rigorous than scrutiny under a prima facie standard.  On this point, Judge Stearns' intention could not have been more explicit.  He told the lawyers:  \"I am going to, for purposes of this hearing, ... basically accept whatever [FMI] allege[s] to be true in terms of the misappropriation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this pronouncement, the court never gave the litigants suitable forewarning of a change of heart, or of the extent to which it would apply the likelihood standard.  To understand the gravity of this omission, it is important to understand the restriction imposed on discovery by Judge Keeton, and how that restriction arose.  On December 15, 1993, FMI moved \"to examine the documents and other materials maintained by BWC which would be relevant to statements in the affidavits of Mr. St. Louis and others concerning contacts with, statements made by, and other information received from Foster-Miller....\"  BWC objected.  The next day Judge Keeton, ruling ore tenus, restricted FMI's discovery to matters \"bear[ing] upon the jurisdictional issue.\"   All other discovery, he ruled, was \"out of bounds\" for the time being.  We think that this limitation, coupled with the judge's simultaneous indication that he would evaluate the motion to dismiss under the prima facie standard, effectively prevented FMI from engaging in merits-related discovery.  And when Judge Stearns then shifted abruptly from the forecasted prima facie standard to the more intrusive likelihood standard, the preexisting restriction--which remained intact on Judge Stearns' watch--hamstrung FMI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this imperfect communication obviously prejudiced FMI's ability fairly to meet the rigors that an across-the-board use of the likelihood standard imposed in the circumstances of this case, we must set aside the court's conclusion that FMI's suit did not \"arise from\" BWC's activities in the forum state.  To that extent, then, the dismissal order succumbs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. ASSESSING REASONABLENESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our odyssey is not yet at an end.  In addition to holding that FMI's claim did not arise from BWC's in-forum contacts, the district court held, alternatively, that it would be unreasonable to exercise jurisdiction over BWC.  See Foster-Miller, 848 F.Supp. at 277;  see generally Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113-16, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 1032-34, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987) (undertaking reasonableness inquiry);  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 476-78, 482-85, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 2184-85, 2187-89, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (similar).  Since the rapid-fire shift of standards probably tainted this conclusion as well, we could simply vacate the alternative holding.  We choose instead to dissect it for three reasons:  the district court's rationale is troubling, it has been reported in a published opinion, and the underlying issue may arise on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hallmark of reasonableness in the context of personal jurisdiction is \"fair play and substantial justice.\"  International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 320, 66 S.Ct. 154, 160, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945).  We have tended to channel the quest for that imperative through a template that highlights five factors.  The factors include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>(1) the defendant's burden of appearing, (2) the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy, and (5) the common interests of all sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pleasant St. I, 960 F.2d at 1088.   We have called the points that compose this template \"the gestalt factors\" because, in any given case, they may neither be amenable to mechanical application nor be capable of producing an open-and-shut result.  Their primary function is simply to illuminate the equitable dimensions of a specific situation, thereby \"put[ting] into sharper perspective the reasonableness and fundamental fairness of exercising jurisdiction\" in that situation.  Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, the trial court found that the first, fourth, and fifth factors did not favor one outcome over the other, but that the remaining two factors discouraged the exercise of jurisdiction.  See Foster-Miller, 848 F.Supp. at 277.   The court then invoked a sixth factor--the ability of a Canadian court to apply Massachusetts law competently and impartially--and concluded that even if \"some harm had flowed to Foster-Miller from the Waltham meeting,\" the suit should be dismissed based on \"considerations of due process.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's analysis is flawed.  First and foremost, the court's added consideration--the absence of any reason to believe that a Canadian court would display bias or prove incapable of applying Massachusetts law--has no place in the minimum contacts calculus.  Though the five gestalt factors should not necessarily be deemed collectively exhaustive, see, e.g., FDIC v. British-American Ins. Co., 828 F.2d 1439, 1442 (9th Cir.1987) (recognizing additional factors), the element seized upon by the court below is of no relevance here.  Moreover, it is already committed to the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 509, 67 S.Ct. 839, 843, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947);  see also Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477 &amp; n. 20, 105 S.Ct. at 2184 &amp; n. 20 (specifically distinguishing between the primary role of the enumerated gestalt factors and the secondary role of considerations relevant to forum non conveniens ).  The doctrines of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens share certain similarities, but they embody distinct concepts and should not casually be conflated.  Compare Allan R. Stein, Forum Non Conveniens and the Redundancy of Court-Access Doctrine, 133 U.Pa.L.Rev. 781, 788-89 (1985) (distinguishing the doctrines) with Margaret G. Stewart, Forum Non Conveniens:  A Doctrine in Search of a Role, 74 Cal.L.Rev. 1259 (1986) (arguing that certain factors currently considered under forum non conveniens doctrine should be subsumed under personal jurisdiction analysis).  Consequently, the district court's self-proclaimed sixth factor adds nothing useful to the jurisdictional mix.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also adopted several other questionable positions, likely influenced by its mistaken blending of the theories of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens, in the course of ascertaining that the second and third gestalt factors militated against the exercise of jurisdiction.  For example, the court deviated from the thrust of the second factor by centering much of its discussion on \"the implications of this litigation for a Canadian industry upon whom [sic] an entire population depends for electric power\" and on the extent to which Canada's interests \"dwarf\" those of Massachusetts.  Foster-Miller, 848 F.Supp. at 277.   This emphasis distorts the directive that a court pondering the second factor must mull \"the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute,\" Pleasant St. I, 960 F.2d at 1088.   The purpose of the inquiry is not to compare the forum's interest to that of some other jurisdiction, but to determine the extent to which the forum has an interest.  See, e.g., Burger King, 471 U.S. at 483 &amp; n. 26, 105 S.Ct. at 2188 &amp; n. 26 (flatly rejecting the notion that a non-forum state's \"acknowledged interest might possibly render jurisdiction in [the forum] unconstitutional \" and observing that \"minimum-contacts analysis presupposes that two or more States may be interested in the outcome of a dispute\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's analysis is equally awry in its treatment of the third gestalt factor (which requires an assessment of \"the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,\" Pleasant St. I, 960 F.2d at 1088).   Although finding that \"it is more convenient for the plaintiff to litigate this matter in domestic comfort,\" Foster-Miller, 848 F.Supp. at 277, the court offset this finding by invoking, inter alia, a presumed inability \"to award plaintiff the full measure of relief that it seeks\" because of doubts concerning both the propriety and the efficacy of enjoining a foreign national whose presence in Massachusetts had been fleeting.  Id.  This concern is beside any relevant point where a plaintiff's inability to obtain certain kinds of relief is wholly a product of her own choice of forum.  At any rate, the plaintiff here explicitly informed the court of its willingness to forgo injunctive relief if necessary to salvage jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have another problem with the district court's assessment of the third gestalt factor.  The court downplayed FMI's convenience because the company \"does business in Canada and is represented by presumably capable Canadian attorneys.\"  Id.  Putting this spin on the matter--emphasizing that the plaintiff could just as easily litigate in a Canadian court--effectively nullifies the plaintiff's choice to litigate its suit not in Canada but in Massachusetts.  Though such judicial second-guessing may be proper in deciding transfer-of-venue motions or when the plaintiff's supposed convenience \"seems to be ... a makeweight,\" contrived purely for strategic advantage, courts considering jurisdictional issues generally should \"accord plaintiff's choice of forum a degree of deference in respect to the issue of its own convenience....\"  Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 211.   So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not comment on the lower court's assessment of the first, fourth, and fifth gestalt factors.  It is evident from what we have written to this point that the order of dismissal cannot plausibly rest on the existing assessment of reasonableness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have come full circle, back to our beginnings.  The Boit framework is an expression of pragmatism--an authoritative recognition, informed both by experience and by the demands placed on the federal bench, that it is desirable for trial judges, when feasible, to give meaningful, yet not unduly burdensome, scrutiny to the question of jurisdiction at the early stages of particular types of cases.  The pragmatic nature of the framework requires courts to proceed with caution, mindful of the risks of overapplication and of the need to give parties ample notice and opportunity to demonstrate that jurisdiction is, or is not, proper.  In the case at hand, the district court failed to provide these latter necessities to FMI.  The court then compounded its error by weighing extraneous elements in attempting to strike a balance on reasonableness.  Thus, we find merit in FMI's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We vacate the order of dismissal.  On remand, the district court should alert the parties in advance to the level of scrutiny that it will apply to the pending motion and the factual questions to which the standard will pertain.  The court should also allow such further discovery, if any, as may be desirable in light of its intentions.  At the appropriate juncture, the court may accept submissions in such form as it deems proper and make its determination on relatedness.  If the court deems the basic jurisdictional tests satisfied, it should then undertake a reasonableness analysis that comports with our precedents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We take no view on the ultimate resolution of the issues to be addressed on remand, or on the proper weighing of the gestalt factors.  Our concern at this stage is primarily with the court's methodology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded.  Costs in favor of appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nonetheless, BWC managed to obtain a sample of the special hose.  The parties dispute whether this occurred before or after the May 11 meeting</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because the scope of this inquiry caught FMI off guard, it tendered a series of post-hearing offers of proof in an effort to make up lost ground.  We do not comment on the timing of FMI's proffers.  Further proceedings in the district court are obligatory, see infra Parts IV(C) &amp; V, at which time new evidentiary submissions can be assembled</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This trilogy forms an interesting contrast with the jurisprudence of the branch of the Massachusetts long-arm statute that applies in many business disputes.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 223A, Sec. 3(a) (1992) (providing in relevant part for the exercise of \"personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's ... transacting any business\" in Massachusetts).  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that, to animate the statute, the facts must show both that the defendant transacted business in Massachusetts, and that the plaintiff's claim arises out of the transaction of that business.  See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., 416 Mass. 763, 625 N.E.2d 549, 551 (1994);  Good Hope Indus., Inc. v. Ryder Scott Co., 378 Mass. 1, 389 N.E.2d 76 (1979).  From our coign of vantage, these two requirements appear to correspond, in reverse order, to the first two of the three constitutional components, i.e., the \"transacting any business\" requirement corresponds to \"minimum contacts,\" while the \"arising from\" requirement corresponds to relatedness</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Such hearings frequently are convened under the aegis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d), which provides in pertinent part that certain defenses, including the defense of lack of in personam jurisdiction, \"shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party,\" unless the court orders a deferral until time of trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Conceivably, such an adjudication may also serve to thrust the judge into a role that, depending upon the circumstances, more appropriately belongs to the jury.  See, e.g., Jacob v. City of New York, 315 U.S. 752, 756, 62 S.Ct. 854, 856, 86 L.Ed. 1166 (1942) (noting basic principle that merely because a \"case is close and a jury might find either way ... is no reason for a court to usurp the function of the jury\");  Nunes v. Farrell Lines, Inc., 227 F.2d 619, 621-22 (1st Cir.1955) (applying principle of Jacob and vacating directed verdict)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This is because the two standards involve markedly different quanta of proof.  So long as a prima facie standard obtained, FMI had neither a right nor a reason, in the course of \"jurisdictional discovery,\" to ferret out all the supporting evidence regarding the confidential nature of what had been discussed in Waltham.  By the same token, it had neither a right nor a reason to document fully the allegedly improper uses of such confidences by BWC.  But once the court shifted to a likelihood standard, the scope, tenor and degree of the prospective inquiry changed, and FMI was caught, like a fawn in the headlights of a speeding van, without the discovery it needed to prove its point</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> To drive this conclusion home, we note two related points.  First, the very case on which the district court relied in assigning weight to the added factor, Howe v. Goldcorp Invs., Ltd., 946 F.2d 944 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1095, 112 S.Ct. 1172, 117 L.Ed.2d 418 (1992), is a forum non conveniens case, not a personal jurisdiction case.  Second, we are unable to discern a link between the judge's hosannas to the Canadian court system and his conclusion that a federal district court sitting in Massachusetts lacks jurisdiction.  Assuming that neither of two courts poses an undue risk of biased or incompetent adjudication, there is nothing to be counted against either of them in working the jurisdictional calculus</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We note that BWC's Rule 12(b) motion raised the matter of forum non conveniens as an independent basis for dismissal.  The district court declined to reach that issue.  See Foster-Miller, 848 F.Supp. at 277 n. 4.   On remand, this issue may be raised again</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(FMI) from an order dismissing its commercial tort action against Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada (BWC)--illustrates vividly that Boit 's flexible approach demands circumspection in its application.  In this case, the district court applied Boit 's intermediate standard too rashly when, eager to test whether a legally sufficient showing of jurisdiction had been made, it neither gave the parties adequate notice that it intended to use this special standard nor ensured that FMI had a fair opportunity to gather and present the evidence necessary for such a showing.  While we are not without sympathy for the district judge--he inherited this case midstream, and Boit, in retrospect, should have emphasized the need to forewarn litigants of a trial court's intention to go beyond the prima facie standard typically associated with motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2)--we cannot permit the dismissal order to stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the operative facts, drawing liberally from the lower court's opinion.  See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Can., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span> </span>(D.Mass.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties to this appeal are quondam competitors:  FMI is a Massachusetts corporation engaged in furnishing sludge and particle removal services for nuclear steam generators;  BWC is a Canadian firm that, among other things, services such generators.  At its core, the litigation concerns a virtual meltdown of the parties' relationship, which in turn detonated a lawsuit.  The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As early as 1988, FMI and BWC entertained the prospect of a joint venture to furnish sludge removal services to Ontario Hydro, a Canadian utility.  Although the joint venture idea stalled and the principals went their separate ways, Canada remained an alluring target.  But the road to prosperity had a large pothole.  FMI's then-extant technology, known by the acronym \"CECIL,\" featured flexible lances that directed powerful bursts of water at pockets of sludge found within the hard-to-reach crannies of nuclear steam boilers.  While this system had distinct competitive advantages over BWC's rival rigid lance system, neither system performed satisfactorily in the cleansing of Canadian boilers (known in the trade as Candu boilers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determined to detour around the \"can't do Candu\" pothole and penetrate the Canadian market, BWC set out to design a lance of unprecedented flexibility.  In 1989, while BWC's development efforts were underway, Ontario Hydro (acting on behalf of a consortium of Canadian utilities) retained FMI to study the feasibility of adapting FMI's flexible lance technology for use in Candu boilers.  As part of this endeavor, FMI contracted with a well-known supplier, U.S. Composites (CompCo), to create a new type of hose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990, Robert A.S. Lee, an FMI employee who had been instrumental in perfecting CECIL, attended an industry conference in Tennessee.  Daniel St. Louis, a BWC engineer involved in that company's push to fashion a flexible lance, attended the same session.  During a previous encounter, the men had casually discussed high pressure hoses.  On this occasion, their conversation became more detailed and focused on the possibility of reinforcing high pressure hoses with certain fibers.  The discussion proved prophetic:  a few weeks thereafter, CompCo delivered the special hose that FMI had asked it to design.  The hose was thought in certain quarters to represent a technological breakthrough.  One of its more revolutionary features was a double-layered Kevlar sheath that supplied desired reinforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 1990, an Ontario Hydro representative, James Malaugh, traveled to FMI's plant in Waltham, Massachusetts, to assess FMI's progress.  Seeking expertise and insight, Malaugh invited St. Louis to join him.  Nonplussed, FMI allowed St. Louis to attend only after BWC signed a confidentiality agreement.  The agreement, duly executed by a ranking official of BWC and transmitted via facsimile machine from Canada, acknowledged that FMI \"anticipate[d] disclosing ... certain information of a novel, proprietary, or confidential nature,\" and memorialized BWC's promise \"not to use [the] information for any purpose unless specifically authorized in writing by FMI.\"   The agreement also stipulated that FMI would be entitled to relief for any breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Leary, the FMI engineer in charge of the Ontario Hydro project, hosted the Waltham session.  The participants debated various aspects of flexible lance technology, including the preferred characteristics of the hose and possible methods of reinforcement.  At one point Leary, responding to a direct question by St. Louis, identified CompCo as FMI's supplier.  Not long after the Waltham meeting, St. Louis contacted CompCo and inquired about the possibility of that company fabricating a similar hose for BWC.  St. Louis' suggestion that FMI would not object proved overly sanguine; after consulting with FMI, CompCo rebuffed BWC's overtures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undaunted, BWC forged ahead in its research effort.  It eventually succeeded in manufacturing its own flexible lance, suitable for Candu boilers.  Thereafter, Ontario Hydro awarded BWC a lucrative contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE LITIGATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 12, 1993, FMI, claiming to have gotten hosed, commenced suit against BWC in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), FMI charged breach of the confidentiality agreement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and unfair competition.  BWC moved to dismiss for lack of in personam jurisdiction or, in the alternative, on the basis of forum non conveniens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Keeton drew the case.  Concerns about the parties' trade secrets slowed discovery to a crawl.  At a conference held on December 16, 1993, Judge Keeton scheduled a hearing on the motion for January 4, 1994, restricted discovery for the time being to matters \"bear[ing] upon the jurisdictional issue,\" and advised counsel that, absent an agreement dissolving the discovery deadlock, he would use the traditional prima facie standard, not the special intermediate standard, in evaluating the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, fate intervened.  In a routine shuffling of cases ancillary to the appointment of several new judicial officers, this case was plucked from Judge Keeton and reassigned to Judge Stearns.  The January 4 hearing never materialized.  Instead, Judge Stearns heard the motion to dismiss on February 1 and 2, 1994.  Though the discovery dispute had not been resolved, Judge Stearns, to FMI's obvious chagrin, undertook not only to probe the existence of the basic facts on which jurisdiction might be premised but also to adjudicate certain ultimate facts (e.g., whether the participants actually disclosed any confidential information at the Waltham meeting).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  And he applied the special intermediate level of scrutiny rather than the more easily satisfied prima facie standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion to dismiss.  After stressing the importance of the Waltham meeting to the jurisdictional issue--BWC, after all, had no other significant contacts with the forum--Judge Stearns articulated two bases for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.  First, he found it unlikely either that proprietary information had been disclosed at the meeting or that such information came into BWC's possession as a result of the meeting;  therefore, FMI's cause of action did not arise from BWC's participation in the meeting as required by the Massachusetts long-arm statute.

Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">276-77</span></span>.   Second, and alternatively, the judge concluded that, even if FMI's claims did arise from BWC's participation in the Waltham meeting, it would be unreasonable for a Massachusetts-based court to exercise jurisdiction over BWC, in part because the court might not be able to grant effective injunctive relief.

APPLYING THE JURISDICTIONAL RULES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A long-arm statute is plainly available for FMI's use.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 223A, Sec. 3(a) (1992).  Section 3(a), quoted supra note 3, is not modest in its reach.  Its language is expansive, and its words are to be generously applied in order to determine whether a given defendant fairly can be said to have participated in the forum's economic life.  See Pleasant St. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580868\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/580868/united-electrical-radio-and-machine-workers-of-america-v-163-pleasant/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1087</span> </a></span>(collecting cases).  Since section 3(a) applies here, we turn directly to the second of the two cornerstone conditions that constitute the foundation for a finding of specific in personam jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, the condition comprises three components.  The first--minimum contacts--is not legitimately in issue.  The seminal jurisdictional fact--that BWC voluntarily dispatched a representative to Massachusetts for commercial advantage pursuant to a written contract with a Massachusetts firm--cannot be gainsaid.  In taking this action, BWC purposefully conducted activities in the forum state, thereby making a suit foreseeable.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580868\"><a href=\"/opinion/580868/united-electrical-radio-and-machine-workers-of-america-v-163-pleasant/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1089. </a></span>  Hence, we endorse the district court's conclusion that BWC transacted business in Massachusetts to such an extent, and in such a manner, as to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Foster-Miller,</span> <span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">276</span></span>;  compare <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684076\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Pritzker,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/684076/jay-a-pritzker-v-bob-yari/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">62</span> </a></span>(finding jurisdiction in part because the nonresident defendant, by contract, had \"knowingly acquir[ed] an economically beneficial interest\" in a forum-based commercial venture).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Setting the matter of minimum contacts to rest, we come face to face with the next component:  relatedness.  In this case, evaluating that requirement reduces to whether FMI's claim arises from BWC's minimum contacts.  To place this issue into proper perspective, we first limn the options that are available to a district court in handling a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction over the person.  We then refine that framework and scrutinize the decision below in light of our handiwork.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>A.

But this is merely one step along the path;  to allocate the burden is neither to define the evidentiary showing necessary to meet it nor to explain whether that showing varies from context to context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We addressed these important issues in Boit.   There, we tried to formulate a procedural matrix that would serve to endow the decisional process with appropriate degrees of economy and manageability.  That endeavor produced a trio of standards, each corresponding to a level of analysis, that might usefully be employed when a trial court comes to grips with a motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most conventional of these methods permits the district court \"to consider only whether the plaintiff has proffered evidence that, if credited, is enough to support findings of all facts essential to personal jurisdiction.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Boit,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>.   To make a prima facie showing of this calibre, the plaintiff ordinarily cannot rest upon the pleadings, but is obliged to adduce evidence of specific facts.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   Withal, the </a></span>district court acts not as a factfinder, but as a data collector.  That is to say, the court, in a manner reminiscent of its role when a motion for summary judgment is on the table, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), must accept the plaintiff's (properly documented) evidentiary proffers as true for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the prima facie jurisdictional showing.  Despite the lack of differential factfinding, this device is a useful means of screening out cases in which personal jurisdiction is obviously lacking, and those in which the jurisdictional challenge is patently bogus.  However, the approach offers little assistance in closer, harder-to-call cases, particularly those that feature conflicting versions of the facts.  See, e.g., General Contracting &amp; Trading Co. v. Interpole, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538796\"><a href=\"/opinion/538796/the-general-contracting-trading-co-llc-v-interpole-inc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second option open to the court is to embark on a factfinding mission in the traditional way, taking evidence and measuring the plaintiff's jurisdictional showing against a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.  In Boit, we stated that this standard may appropriately be invoked when a court</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>determine[s] that in the circumstances of a particular case it is unfair to force an out-of-state defendant to incur the expense and burden of a trial on the merits in the local forum without first requiring more of the plaintiff than a prima facie showing of facts essential to in personam jurisdiction.  A court may so determine, for example, when the proffered evidence is conflicting and the record is rife with contradictions, or when a plaintiff's affidavits are \"patently incredible....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Boit,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">676</span> </a></span>(offering examples).  Virtually by definition, the preponderance standard necessitates a full-blown evidentiary hearing at which the court will adjudicate the jurisdictional issue definitively before the case reaches trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In that mode, the court will \"consider[ ] all relevant evidence proffered by the parties and mak[e] all factual findings essential to disposition of the motion.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  But this </a></span>method must be used discreetly.  For one thing, pretrial evidentiary hearings are relatively cumbersome creatures, and, if used routinely, can squander judicial resources.  For another thing, since this method contemplates a binding adjudication, the court's factual determinations ordinarily will have preclusive effect, and, thus, at least in situations in which the facts pertinent to jurisdiction and the facts pertinent to the merits are identical, or nearly so, profligate use of the preponderance method can all too easily verge on a deprivation of the right to trial by jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Boit, we recognized these difficulties.  We also recognized that the prima facie and preponderance-of-the-evidence standards are merely two of several possible models, and that trial courts need not confine themselves to choosing between these two levels of evidentiary scrutiny.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 677. </a></span>  In the special circumstance in which the assertion of jurisdiction is bound up with the claim on the merits, the possibility of preclusion renders use of the preponderance standard troubling, while the possibility of permitting a dubious case to proceed beyond the pleading stage, and even to trial, though the court eventually will be found to lack jurisdiction, renders use of the prima facie standard undesirable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Boit panel anticipated that, when this special circumstance arose, trial courts might steer a middle course by engaging in some differential factfinding, limited to probable outcomes as opposed to definitive findings of fact, thereby skirting potential preclusionary problems while at the same time enhancing the courts' ability to weed out unfounded claims of jurisdiction.  Utilizing this intermediate standard, a district court, \"even though allowing an evidentiary hearing and weighing evidence to make findings ... may merely find whether the plaintiff has shown a likelihood of the existence of each fact necessary to support personal jurisdiction.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  This showing </a></span>constitutes an assurance that the circumstances justify imposing on a foreign defendant the burdens of trial in a strange forum, but leaves to the time of trial a binding resolution of the factual disputes common to both the jurisdictional issue and the merits of the claim.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 678.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the prima facie standard, and like the preponderance standard, this third method, which we sometimes call the \"likelihood standard,\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>involves factfinding rather than merely making a ruling of law regarding sufficiency of the evidence to present a fact question.  Like the first and unlike the second method, however, the third method avoids potentially troubling issues of \"issue preclusion\" or \"law of the case\" (at least when the court denies the motion) because a determination by such an intermediate standard ... does not purport to be a finding by the same standard on the same issue as will be decided at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that having an array of standards at the ready may be thought too much of a good thing.  However, even though an intermediate standard will not be used with great frequency, the need for one is manifest.  We can postulate a variety of \"common facts\" scenarios in which the facts necessary to sustain personal jurisdiction are intimately bound up with facts necessary to establish the merits of the underlying claim.  See, e.g., Ann Althouse, The Use of Conspiracy Theory to Establish In Personam Jurisdiction:  A Due Process Analysis, 52 Fordham L.Rev. 234, 247-51 (1983) (noting, though not adequately resolving, the problem created in situations where proving the facts \"upon which jurisdiction depends is viewed as inextricably tied to the substantive merits of the case\").  It is precisely because of the incidence of these situations--situations in which the issue of jurisdiction is factually enmeshed with the merits of the suit--that we recognized in Boit the need for an intermediate standard of proof and, correspondingly, an intermediate standard of judicial analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>B. Standards of Review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are reluctant to end our discussion of the methods available to district courts for testing jurisdictional waters without mentioning appellate review.  As a practical matter, the standard of review will depend in the first instance on whether the court of appeals is reviewing the district court's choice of an analytic method or its application of such a method.  As for the court's initial choice from among the three standards we have discussed--prima facie, likelihood, or preponderance--appellate review is de novo.

Two considerations point to the applicability of this deferential mode of review in this situation.  First, the nature of a likelihood analysis is such that it falls naturally within the realm of discretionary decisionmaking.  Second, from a practical standpoint, a likelihood analysis simply does not seem amenable to either of the other standards.  Unlike the classic motion to dismiss, in which the plaintiff's assertions are accepted as true, a likelihood analysis requires the judge to pass upon the accuracy and integrity of the plaintiff's assertions.  Yet, in contrast to a preponderance-of-the-evidence analysis, these determinations are not true findings of fact, for they lack definiteness to some degree, and they also lack the preclusive quality that would otherwise normally attach.  Consequently, we believe that abuse of discretion is the proper standard of review.

Its appeal raises potentially difficult questions about the application of Boit 's likelihood standard in certain types of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to note that the paradigm case--involving the use of Boit 's intermediate standard as a basis for exercising jurisdiction, i.e., as a basis for denying a motion to dismiss--hardly seems problematic.  In such a scenario, the plaintiff is permitted to proceed in its forum of choice, yet the defendant has the consolation of having been afforded a detailed demonstration, beyond a mere prima facie showing, of why the court deems it fair to exercise jurisdiction, at least provisionally.  It is only when Boit 's intermediate standard is used as a basis for declining the exercise of jurisdiction, i.e., as a basis for granting a motion to dismiss, that the prospect of mischief looms.  One can easily imagine cases in which the likelihood standard might be applied to adjudicate facts that are only marginally related to jurisdiction, or are very closely related to the merits of the plaintiff's substantive claims, thus prematurely extinguishing a plaintiff's ability to present its case in a full and fair manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, whatever its merits in the abstract, Boit 's intermediate standard requires caution in its application, especially when it appears that a dismissal may result.  Indeed, although Boit does, in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">dictum,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">677-78</span></a></span>, propose to authorize such dismissals, it is noteworthy that, apart from the opinion of the court below, there is no other reported case, Boit included, that has sanctioned a dismissal pursuant to a district court's use of the likelihood standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, this is as it should be.  To the limited extent that dismissals under Boit 's intermediate standard are justified at all, they will happen only rarely.  Even then, the exact bounds of permissible application may not always be evident.  Nonetheless, we believe it is better to tolerate the inconvenience of mild doctrinal uncertainty rather than to forgo altogether the utility of an intermediate standard and method of analysis.  See generally Stephen L. Carter, Constitutional Adjudication and the Indeterminate Text:  A Preliminary Defense of an Imperfect Muddle, 94 Yale L.J. 821 (1985) (recognizing the impossibility of removing all uncertainty from legal doctrine);  Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Path of the Law, 10 Harv.L.Rev. 457, 465 (1897) (warning that, in respect to judicial decisions, \"certainty generally is illusion, and repose is not the destiny of man\").  The bottom line, clearly, is that judges employing Boit 's intermediate standard should proceed with great care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, these potential difficulties are peripheral to the instant appeal.  In this instance, the flaw is less Judge Stearns' initial decision to switch the signals previously given by Judge Keeton and instead apply the intermediate standard, but more his failure to apprise FMI squarely of this change of plan--a failure that was aggravated by FMI's inability to engage in appropriate discovery and then to present the totality of its evidence within the context of a likelihood analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When judges elect on their own initiative to use innovative methods in an effort to accelerate the progress of a case, they must take pains to ensure that parties are given satisfactory notice, reasonable access to discovery, and a meaningful opportunity to present evidence.  See, e.g., Stella v. Town of Tewksbury, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194924\"><a href=\"/opinion/194924/stella-v-tewksbury-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 55-56 (1st Cir.1993) (stating these principles in the context of sua sponte summary judgment);  Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v.

While the likelihood standard has value, the latent risks associated with its use are not insignificant, and they should be ameliorated to the extent practicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the lower court did not afford FMI the process that was due.  To be sure, Judge Stearns advised counsel at a status conference on January 20, 1994, that he was pondering the use of the likelihood standard, but he neither eased the existing restriction on discovery nor superseded Judge Keeton's prior directives.  The prima facie standard remained the default setting, and Judge Stearns' intentions remained open to conjecture until the day of the hearing.  Indeed, while the court transmitted mixed signals to some degree, it closed the January 20 conference by specifically announcing that the question of misappropriation would not be subject to anything more rigorous than scrutiny under a prima facie standard.  On this point, Judge Stearns' intention could not have been more explicit.  He told the lawyers:  \"I am going to, for purposes of this hearing, ... basically accept whatever [FMI] allege[s] to be true in terms of the misappropriation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this pronouncement, the court never gave the litigants suitable forewarning of a change of heart, or of the extent to which it would apply the likelihood standard.  To understand the gravity of this omission, it is important to understand the restriction imposed on discovery by Judge Keeton, and how that restriction arose.  On December 15, 1993, FMI moved \"to examine the documents and other materials maintained by BWC which would be relevant to statements in the affidavits of Mr. St. Louis and others concerning contacts with, statements made by, and other information received from Foster-Miller....\"  BWC objected.  The next day Judge Keeton, ruling ore tenus, restricted FMI's discovery to matters \"bear[ing] upon the jurisdictional issue.\"   All other discovery, he ruled, was \"out of bounds\" for the time being.  We think that this limitation, coupled with the judge's simultaneous indication that he would evaluate the motion to dismiss under the prima facie standard, effectively prevented FMI from engaging in merits-related discovery.  And when Judge Stearns then shifted abruptly from the forecasted prima facie standard to the more intrusive likelihood standard, the preexisting restriction--which remained intact on Judge Stearns' watch--hamstrung FMI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this imperfect communication obviously prejudiced FMI's ability fairly to meet the rigors that an across-the-board use of the likelihood standard imposed in the circumstances of this case, we must set aside the court's conclusion that FMI's suit did not \"arise from\" BWC's activities in the forum state.  To that extent, then, the dismissal order succumbs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.

Although finding that \"it is more convenient for the plaintiff to litigate this matter in domestic comfort,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Foster-Miller,</span> <span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">277</span></span>, the court offset this finding by invoking, inter alia, a presumed inability \"to award plaintiff the full measure of relief that it seeks\" because of doubts concerning both the propriety and the efficacy of enjoining a foreign national whose presence in Massachusetts had been fleeting.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  This concern </span>is beside any relevant point where a plaintiff's inability to obtain certain kinds of relief is wholly a product of her own choice of forum.

Though such judicial second-guessing may be proper in deciding transfer-of-venue motions or when the plaintiff's supposed convenience \"seems to be ... a makeweight,\" contrived purely for strategic advantage, courts considering jurisdictional issues generally should \"accord plaintiff's choice of forum a degree of deference in respect to the issue of its own convenience....\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672029\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ticketmaster,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/672029/ticketmaster-new-york-inc-v-joseph-m-alioto/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>.

It is evident from what we have written to this point that the order of dismissal cannot plausibly rest on the existing assessment of reasonableness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have come full circle, back to our beginnings.  The Boit framework is an expression of pragmatism--an authoritative recognition, informed both by experience and by the demands placed on the federal bench, that it is desirable for trial judges, when feasible, to give meaningful, yet not unduly burdensome, scrutiny to the question of jurisdiction at the early stages of particular types of cases.  The pragmatic nature of the framework requires courts to proceed with caution, mindful of the risks of overapplication and of the need to give parties ample notice and opportunity to demonstrate that jurisdiction is, or is not, proper.  In the case at hand, the district court failed to provide these latter necessities to FMI.  The court then compounded its error by weighing extraneous elements in attempting to strike a balance on reasonableness.  Thus, we find merit in FMI's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We vacate the order of dismissal.  On remand, the district court should alert the parties in advance to the level of scrutiny that it will apply to the pending motion and the factual questions to which the standard will pertain.  The court should also allow such further discovery, if any, as may be desirable in light of its intentions.  At the appropriate juncture, the court may accept submissions in such form as it deems proper and make its determination on relatedness.  If the court deems the basic jurisdictional tests satisfied, it should then undertake a reasonableness analysis that comports with our precedents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We take no view on the ultimate resolution of the issues to be addressed on remand, or on the proper weighing of the gestalt factors.  Our concern at this stage is primarily with the court's methodology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded.  Costs in favor of appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nonetheless, BWC managed to obtain a sample of the special hose.  The parties dispute whether this occurred before or after the May 11 meeting</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because the scope of this inquiry caught FMI off guard, it tendered a series of post-hearing offers of proof in an effort to make up lost ground.  We do not comment on the timing of FMI's proffers.  Further proceedings in the district court are obligatory, see infra Parts IV(C) &amp; V, at which time new evidentiary submissions can be assembled</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This trilogy forms an interesting contrast with the jurisprudence of the branch of the Massachusetts long-arm statute that applies in many business disputes.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 223A, Sec. 3(a) (1992) (providing in relevant part for the exercise of \"personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's ... transacting any business\" in Massachusetts).  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that, to animate the statute, the facts must show both that the defendant transacted business in Massachusetts, and that the plaintiff's claim arises out of the transaction of that business.  See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></span>, 551 (1994);  Good Hope Indus., Inc. v. Ryder Scott Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2168930\"><a href=\"/opinion/2168930/good-hope-industries-inc-v-ryder-scott-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2168930\"><a href=\"/opinion/2168930/good-hope-industries-inc-v-ryder-scott-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span> </a></span>(1979).  From our coign of vantage, these two requirements appear to correspond, in reverse order, to the first two of the three constitutional components, i.e., the \"transacting any business\" requirement corresponds to \"minimum contacts,\" while the \"arising from\" requirement corresponds to relatedness</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Such hearings frequently are convened under the aegis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d), which provides in pertinent part that certain defenses, including the defense of lack of in personam jurisdiction, \"shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party,\" unless the court orders a deferral until time of trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Conceivably, such an adjudication may also serve to thrust the judge into a role that, depending upon the circumstances, more appropriately belongs to the jury.  See, e.g., Jacob v. City of New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103647\"><a href=\"/opinion/103647/jacob-v-new-york-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, 756, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103647\"><a href=\"/opinion/103647/jacob-v-new-york-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span>, 856, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103647\"><a href=\"/opinion/103647/jacob-v-new-york-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span> </a></span>(1942) (noting basic principle that merely because a \"case is close and a jury might find either way ... is no reason for a court to usurp the function of the jury\");  Nunes v. Farrell Lines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"237958\"><a href=\"/opinion/237958/joseph-e-nunes-v-farrell-lines-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 621-22 (1st Cir.1955) (applying principle of Jacob and vacating directed verdict)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This is because the two standards involve markedly different quanta of proof.  So long as a prima facie standard obtained, FMI had neither a right nor a reason, in the course of \"jurisdictional discovery,\" to ferret out all the supporting evidence regarding the confidential nature of what had been discussed in Waltham.  By the same token, it had neither a right nor a reason to document fully the allegedly improper uses of such confidences by BWC.  But once the court shifted to a likelihood standard, the scope, tenor and degree of the prospective inquiry changed, and FMI was caught, like a fawn in the headlights of a speeding van, without the discovery it needed to prove its point</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> To drive this conclusion home, we note two related points.  First, the very case on which the district court relied in assigning weight to the added factor, Howe v. Goldcorp Invs., Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570021\"><a href=\"/opinion/570021/reginald-h-howe-v-goldcorp-investments-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1172</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span> </span>(1992), is a forum non conveniens case, not a personal jurisdiction case.  Second, we are unable to discern a link between the judge's hosannas to the Canadian court system and his conclusion that a federal district court sitting in Massachusetts lacks jurisdiction.  Assuming that neither of two courts poses an undue risk of biased or incompetent adjudication, there is nothing to be counted against either of them in working the jurisdictional calculus</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We note that BWC's Rule 12(b) motion raised the matter of forum non conveniens as an independent basis for dismissal.  The district court declined to reach that issue.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Foster-Miller,</span> <span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">277</span> </span>n. 4.   On remand, this issue may be raised again</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
