See Fed. R. Civ.  P. 12(b)(6).  As  the district court\r                        \r\n\nincorrectly  concluded  that their  claims  were time-barred,  we\r\n\nvacate the judgments and remand for further proceedings. \r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                           BACKGROUND1\r                                     BACKGROUND\r                                               \r\n\n          On  February 9,  1993,  Calero  commenced  this  action\r\n\nagainst  various police  officers of  the Commonwealth  of Puerto\r\n\nRico  and their confidential informants.  Robles followed suit on\r\n\nNovember 2, 1993, and the cases  were consolidated.  At the heart\r\n\nof  both  complaints  are  allegations  that Jos   Crespo-Guill n\r\n\n(\"Crespo\")    an undercover  Puerto Rico police officer     and a\r\n\nconfidential informant named Rosa, persuaded certain Commonwealth\r\n\nauthorities to provide front money for undercover drug buys which\r\n\nnever  were intended to take place.  The complaints asserted that\r\n\nCrespo and Rosa falsely identified appellants as the \"sellers\" in\r\n\ntwo  concocted  undercover  drug  buys,  thereby  causing  arrest\r\n\nwarrants to issue against each.  Calero was arrested on August 1,\r\n\n1990, and Robles  on March  20, 1992, for  allegedly selling  one\r\n\nounce of cocaine to Crespo.  On July 1, 1992,  Calero was acquit-\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals are reviewed under the rubric that\r\nall reasonable inferences from well-pleaded facts are to be drawn\r\nin  appellants' favor.  P rez-Ruiz v. Crespo-Guill n, 25 F.3d 40,\r                                                              \r\n42 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nted; Robles was acquitted on July 2, 1993.  \r\n\n          Although  both  Calero  and  Robles   maintained  their\r\n\ninnocence  from  the moment  of  their  respective arrests,  each\r\n\nclaims that he  did not know  the true nature  and extent of  the\r\n\nscheme that led to the arrest  until after he had been acquitted.\r\n\nIn  all events,  within  months of  their respective  acquittals,\r\n\nCalero and  Robles initiated lawsuits alleging  violations of the\r\n\nFourth and  Fourteenth Amendments to the  United States Constitu-\r\n\ntion  and violations of Puerto Rico law.  Shortly thereafter, the\r\n\nappellees moved to  dismiss on  the ground that  the claims  were\r\n\ntime-barred. \r\n\n          The district court  deemed appellants' claims analogous\r\n\nto  the common law torts  of false arrest  and malicious prosecu-\r\n\ntion.  It found that the one-year limitation borrowed from Puerto\r\n\nRico  law  barred their  respective  false  arrest claims,  which\r\n\naccrued at the  dates of arrest.2  Although the  court ruled that\r\n\ntheir \"malicious prosecution\"  type claims were not  time-barred,\r\n\nit  held them  not actionable  under section  1983, whether  on a\r\n\nsubstantive or procedural  due process theory.

For purposes of determining when a claimant knew or\r\n\nhad  reason to know of the alleged  injury, we look to the common\r\n\nlaw cause of action most  closely analogous to the constitutional\r\n\nright at stake.   Heck, 114 S. Ct.  at 2371.  As the  elements in\r                                \r\n\nany  species of section 1983 \"tort\" are ordained by its constitu-\r\n\ntional prototype, we first identify the particular constitutional\r\n\nright  allegedly infringed.  See  Albright v. Oliver,  114 S. Ct.\r                                                              \r\n\n807, 811 (1994).  \r\n\n          These  complaints specifically  state that  Puerto Rico\r\n\npolice officers arrested Calero and  Robles pursuant to a warrant\r\n\npredicated  on false  allegations  by  Crespo  and Rosa.    Thus,\r\n\nappellants' section  1983 claims  directly  implicate both  their\r\n\nFourth  Amendment right to be free  from any unreasonable seizure\r\n\nof  their persons, see Lippay v. Christos, 996 F.2d 1490, 1502-03\r                                                   \r\n\n(3d  Cir. 1993)  (discussing Fourth  Amendment standards  in case\r\n\ninvolving arrest  based on warrant), and  their Fourteenth Amend-\r\n\nment  right  to be  free  from criminal  prosecution  without due\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nprocess of law.4  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Appellants have not appealed from the district court ruling\r\ndismissing  their Fourteenth Amendment claims.  See supra, pp. 3-\r                                                                   \r\n4.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          The district  court found the Fourteenth  Amendment due\r\n\nprocess claims  more closely analogous  to the tort  of malicious\r\n\nprosecution, but  that the  Fourth Amendment claims  more closely\r\n\nresembled  the  common law  tort of  false  arrest.   Even though\r\n\nmalicious  prosecution5  and  false  arrest6  may  seem  distinct\r\n\nenough in abstract definition, however, in a wrongful arrest case\r\n\n   particularly an arrest  conducted pursuant to a  warrant based\r                                                                           \r\n\non  false allegations     the  lines between  the two  may become\r                               \r\n\nblurred.   In  the present  case, we  believe appellants'  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment  claims more  closely resemble the  common law  tort of\r\n\nmalicious prosecution as well.7  \r\n\n          The  Supreme Court has noted that  the common law cause\r\n\nof action for malicious prosecution, unlike false arrest, permits\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Generally speaking, in order to state a cause of action for\r\nmalicious prosecution, a claimant  must allege: (1) the commence-\r                               \r\nment or continuation  of a criminal  proceeding by the  defendant\r\nagainst  the plaintiff; (2) the termination  of the proceeding in\r\nfavor  of the accused; (3) the  absence of probable cause for the\r\ncriminal proceeding; and (4) actual malice.

City of\r                                                                           \r\nWarwick, 628 F.2d 736, 745 n.6 (1st Cir. 1980). \r                 \r\n\n     6Typically, the elements of a false arrest claim are said to\r                                                         \r\nbe that: (1) the defendant intended to confine the plaintiff; (2)\r\nthe plaintiff was conscious of the confinement; (3) the plaintiff\r\ndid  not consent to the confinement; and (4) the defendant had no\r\nprivilege to cause the confinement.  See Restatement  (Second) Of\r                                                  \r\nTorts    35, 118 cmt.  b (1965).  Neither actual malice  nor lack\r\nof probable cause is an element of false arrest. \r\n\n     7Although  there is no  substantive due process  right to be\r\nfree from  malicious prosecution, see P rez-Ruiz, 25  F.3d at 42,\r                                                          \r\nthe Supreme  Court has held  that a \"malicious  prosecution\" type\r\nclaim may be actionable  under the Fourth Amendment in  a section\r\n1983  action.

See also Malley v.\r                                                                        \r\nBriggs,  475  U.S. 335  (1986)  (discussing  liability of  police\r                \r\nofficer  who  allegedly  applied  for  arrest  warrants,  without\r\nprobable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment).  \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ndamages  for confinement pursuant to legal process.

The interest at stake  in a malicious  prosecution\r\n\nclaim  is the  right  to be  free  from deprivations  of  liberty\r\n\ninterests caused  by  unjustifiable criminal  charges and  proce-\r\n\ndures.  In contrast, false arrests  infringe upon the right to be\r\n\nfree from  restraints on bodily  movement.8  The  remedies avail-\r\n\nable  in the two tort  actions mirror the  different interests at\r\n\nstake.    Damages for  false arrest  are  restricted to  the time\r\n\nperiod between  the initial detention  and the issuance  of legal\r\n\nprocess, whereas the  tort of malicious prosecution  contemplates\r\n\ngeneral  damages  as well  as  compensation  for any  arrest  and\r\n\nimprisonment preceding  the termination of  the criminal proceed-\r\n\ning.  Id.   \r                   \r\n\n          The  critical  inquiry  that   distinguishes  malicious\r\n\nprosecution from false arrest  in the present context is  whether\r\n\nthe arrests  were made pursuant to  a warrant.  Singer  v. Fulton\r                                                                           \r\n\nCounty Sheriff, No. 94-9093, 1995 WL 470283, at *5  (2d Cir. Aug.\r                        \r\n\n9, 1995).   As a general  rule, an unlawful arrest  pursuant to a\r\n\nwarrant will be more closely analogous  to the common law tort of\r\n\nmalicious prosecution.    An  arrest  warrant  constitutes  legal\r\n\nprocess, and it is the tort of malicious prosecution that permits\r\n\ndamages  for confinement pursuant to legal process.  On the other\r\n\nhand, wrongful warrantless arrests typically resemble the tort of\r\n\nfalse arrest.  Id.  \r                            \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8For a cogent  discussion of  the two torts  in the  section\r\n1983 context, see  Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff,  No. 94-9093,\r                                                            \r\n1995 WL 470283 (2d Cir. Aug. 9, 1995). \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we hold that    for purposes\r\n\nof determining  the appropriate accrual  rule    both  the Fourth\r\n\nand Fourteenth Amendment claims  more closely resemble the common\r\n\nlaw tort  of  malicious prosecution.   Consequently,  appellants'\r\n\nsection 1983 claims did not accrue until  their respective crimi-\r\n\nnal prosecutions ended in acquittals.  Heck, 114 S.  Ct. at 2371;\r                                                     \r\n\nGuzman-Rivera, 29 F.3d at 5.  \r                       \r\n\n          All  that remains is to apply the accrual rule.  Calero\r\n\nwas acquitted on July 1, 1992.  Well within the  one-year limita-\r\n\ntion    on February 9, 1993     he commenced the present  action.\r\n\nSimilarly, Robles was acquitted on July 2, 1993, and brought suit\r\n\non  November 2, 1993.   Thus, their  section 1983 claims  are not\r\n\ntime-barred. \r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          In  sum, reference  to  common law  tort principles  is\r\n\nappropriate in identifying  the most suitable rule of accrual for\r\n\napplication  to section 1983  claims, always bearing  in mind the\r\n\nlegislative aims which Congress sought to advance by establishing\r\n\na  federal  forum for  redressing deprivations  of constitutional\r\n\nrights.   Cf. Wyatt v. Cole, 112 S. Ct. 1827, 1831 (1992) (noting\r                                     \r\n\nthat  common law  immunities  are not  necessarily applicable  to\r\n\nsection  1983 claims).   Accordingly,  the essential  elements of\r\n\nactionable section 1983 claims derive first and foremost from the\r\n\nConstitution itself,  not necessarily  from the  analogous common\r\n\nlaw  tort.   See Graham  v. Connor,  490 U.S. 386,  394-97 (1989)\r                                            \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n(analyzing  excessive force  claim under  Fourth Amendment  stan-\r\n\ndards).  Consequently, on remand Calero and Robles must establish\r\n\nthat their  respective Fourth  Amendment rights were  violated by\r\n\none  or more appellees.   See, e.g., Lippay,  996 F.2d at 1502-03\r                                                     \r\n\n(discussing  one theory  of  liability for  violating the  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment).\r\n\n          The district court judgments  are vacated, and the case\r                                                                           \r\n\nis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCosts are awarded to appellants.  \r                                         \r\n\n                  - Concurring Opinion Follows -\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n          LYNCH, Circuit  Judge, concurring.  I  write separately\r                    LYNCH, Circuit  Judge, concurring\r                                                     \r\n\nto stress my understanding that  in Fourth Amendment claims under\r\n\n  1983 arising out of a warrantless arrest the statute of limita-\r\n\ntions  may typically, but does  not necessarily, begin  to run at\r                                                         \r\n\nthe time of arrest.\r\n\n          There  may be circumstances in which plaintiffs neither\r\n\nknew, nor  had reason to know,  at the time  of their warrantless\r\n\narrests that they had suffered a constitutional injury and so the\r\n\nstatute  would  not begin  to run  upon  arrest.   Similarly, the\r\n\narrest may  lead to  a chain  of events  leading  to a  different\r\n\ncharacterization of  the entire  constitutional injury, and  so a\r\n\ndifferent accrual date.  See Robinson v. Maruffi, 895 F. 2d  649,\r                                                          \r\n\n654-55 (10th Cir. 1990).  That the common law of false arrest has\r\n\noften  been interpreted to establish that the common law cause of\r\n\naction accrues upon the  arrest1 does not answer the  question of\r\n\nthe  accrual date  for    1983 actions.    The Supreme  Court  in\r\n\nAlbright v. Oliver,  114 S.  Ct. 807 (1994),  and earlier  cases,\r                            \r\n\nsee,  e.g., Graham  v.

The complaints asserted that Crespo and Rosa falsely identified appellants as the \"sellers\" in two concocted undercover drug buys, thereby causing arrest warrants to issue against each.  Calero was arrested on August 1, 1990, and Robles on March 20, 1992, for allegedly selling one ounce of cocaine to Crespo.

Consequently, appellants' section 1983 claims did not accrue until their respective criminal prosecutions ended in acquittals.  Heck, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2371;  Guzman-Rivera, 29 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All that remains is to apply the accrual rule.  Calero was acquitted on July 1, 1992.  Well within the one-year limitation--on February 9, 1993--he commenced the present action.  Similarly, Robles was acquitted on July 2, 1993, and brought suit on November 2, 1993.  Thus, their section 1983 claims are not time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, reference to common law tort principles is appropriate in identifying the most suitable rule of accrual for application to section 1983 claims, always bearing in mind the legislative aims which Congress sought to advance by establishing a federal forum for redressing deprivations of constitutional rights.  Cf. Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U.S. 158, 163-164, 112 S.Ct. 1827, 1831, 118 L.Ed.2d 504 (1992) (noting that common law immunities are not necessarily applicable to section 1983 claims).  Accordingly, the essential elements of actionable section 1983 claims derive first and foremost from the Constitution itself, not necessarily from the analogous common law tort.  See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1870-72, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (analyzing excessive force claim under Fourth Amendment standards).  Consequently, on remand Calero and Robles must establish that their respective Fourth Amendment rights were violated by one or more appellees.  See, e.g., Lippay, 996 F.2d at 1502-03 (discussing one theory of liability for violating the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgments are vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Similarly, the arrest may lead to a chain of events leading to a different characterization of the entire constitutional injury, and so a different accrual date.  See Robinson v. Maruffi, 895 F.2d 649, 654-55 (10th Cir.1990).  That the common law of false arrest has often been interpreted to establish that the common law cause of action accrues upon the arrest<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> does not answer the question of the accrual date for Sec. 1983 actions.  The Supreme Court in Albright v. Oliver, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994), and earlier cases, see, e.g., Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989), has instructed federal courts to look to the true nature of the constitutional claims being asserted, rejecting labels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Judge Cyr's very thoughtful opinion states:  \"[t]he essential elements of actionable section 1983 claims derive first and foremost from the Constitution itself, not necessarily from the analogous common law tort.\"   Accordingly, the law does not, I believe, bind the accrual date for the constitutional tort in warrantless arrests inevitably and invariably to the date of arrest.

Robles followed suit on November 2, 1993, and the cases were consolidated.  At the heart of both complaints are allegations that Jose Crespo-Guillen (\"Crespo\")--an undercover Puerto Rico police officer--and a confidential informant named Rosa, persuaded certain Commonwealth authorities to provide front money for undercover drug buys which never were intended to take place.  The complaints asserted that Crespo and Rosa falsely identified appellants as the \"sellers\" in two concocted undercover drug buys, thereby causing arrest warrants to issue against each.  Calero was arrested on August 1, 1990, and Robles on March 20, 1992, for allegedly selling one ounce of cocaine to Crespo.

Consequently, appellants' section 1983 claims did not accrue until their respective criminal prosecutions ended in acquittals.  Heck, --- U.S. at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">2371</span></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195482\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Guzman-Rivera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195482/guzman-rivera-v-rivera-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All that remains is to apply the accrual rule.  Calero was acquitted on July 1, 1992.  Well within the one-year limitation--on February 9, 1993--he commenced the present action.  Similarly, Robles was acquitted on July 2, 1993, and brought suit on November 2, 1993.  Thus, their section 1983 claims are not time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, reference to common law tort principles is appropriate in identifying the most suitable rule of accrual for application to section 1983 claims, always bearing in mind the legislative aims which Congress sought to advance by establishing a federal forum for redressing deprivations of constitutional rights.  Cf. Wyatt v. Cole, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112733\"><a href=\"/opinion/112733/wyatt-v-cole/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 163-164, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112733\"><a href=\"/opinion/112733/wyatt-v-cole/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span> </a></span>(1992) (noting that common law immunities are not necessarily applicable to section 1983 claims).  Accordingly, the essential elements of actionable section 1983 claims derive first and foremost from the Constitution itself, not necessarily from the analogous common law tort.  See Graham v. Connor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 394-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span> </a></span>(1989) (analyzing excessive force claim under Fourth Amendment standards).  Consequently, on remand Calero and Robles must establish that their respective Fourth Amendment rights were violated by one or more appellees.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610579\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lippay,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/610579/richard-m-lippay-v-dean-c-christos-commonwealth-of-pa-dean-c-christos/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1502-03</span> </a></span>(discussing one theory of liability for violating the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgments are vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Similarly, the arrest may lead to a chain of events leading to a different characterization of the entire constitutional injury, and so a different accrual date.  See Robinson v. Maruffi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536136\"><a href=\"/opinion/536136/van-bering-robinson-v-john-maruffi-joseph-polisar-clarence-kraemer-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span>, 654-55 (10th Cir.1990).  That the common law of false arrest has often been interpreted to establish that the common law cause of action accrues upon the arrest<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> does not answer the question of the accrual date for Sec. 1983 actions.
