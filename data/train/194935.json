Raymond  Cronkite purchased  46\n                          \n\nacres of  land in  1982, giving  the seller a  note on  which\n\nCronkite  later defaulted.  In April 1985, the then holder of\n\nthe  note, Maine  National  Bank, entered  into a  settlement\n\nagreement  with Cronkite,  who  agreed to  a revised  payment\n\nschedule  for the  1982  note and  gave  the bank  a  blanket\n\nmortgage  on all  his property  in York  County, Maine.   The\n\nagreement also  included a  paragraph obligating the  bank at\n\nCronkite's request  to  \"release parcels\"  from  the  blanket\n\nmortgage, provided that Cronkite met four conditions:\n\n     --that he  not be  in default under  the agreement;\n\n     --that he not be  in default as to his  existing payment\n     obligations to the bank;\n\n     --that he show  the bank  a net worth  of over  150\n     percent  of  the  remaining  principal  and accrued\n     interest on the note; and\n\n     --that  he seek the release in order \"to complete a\n     fair market value sale\" and provide the bank with a\n     copy of the contract showing  the sales price and a\n     with a  good faith estimate of  the distribution of\n     the sales proceeds.\n\n     In December 1985, Cronkite arranged  to sell a parcel of\n\nproperty that he  owned (\"lot  8\") which was  not subject  to\n\nMaine National Bank's  blanket mortgage.  Lot 8, however, was\n\nsubject  to a mortgage held by the Saco and Biddeford Savings\n\nBank  (\"the Saco Bank\").  To obtain release of that mortgage,\n\nCronkite proposed  that Maine  National Bank  subordinate its\n\ninterest in  lot  136,  which  was  subject  to  the  blanket\n\nmortgage,  to the interest  of the Saco Bank.   The Saco Bank\n\n                             -2-\n\nwas  willing  to  release its  mortgage  on  lot  8 if  Maine\n\nNational  Bank  would allow  lot  136  to  be substituted  as\n\ncollateral for Cronkite's debt to the Saco Bank.\n\n     Although  what  happened next  is  the  subject of  some\n\ndispute,  ultimately   Maine   National  Bank   declined   to\n\nsubordinate its interest in lot 136, taking the position that\n\nit had agreed to release parcels under certain conditions but\n\nnot  to subordinate  its  interest.   Thereafter the  Federal\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") became the receiver of\n\nMaine  National   Bank.    After   exhausting  the   required\n\nadministrative remedies, Cronkite brought the present suit in\n\nthe  district  court  against  the FDIC  for  breach  of  the\n\nsettlement agreement  based on Maine National  Bank's failure\n\nto subordinate its interest in lot 136.1\n\n     The magistrate judge  granted summary  judgment for  the\n\nFDIC,  ruling  that  the  settlement agreement  on  its  face\n\nrequired the bank to release property but  not to subordinate\n\nit.    The  district  court adopted  the  magistrate  judge's\n\nrecommended decision.  This appeal followed.  Cronkite's main\n\nargument is that since  \"subordination\" is a lesser sacrifice\n\nof  interest   than  a   full  \"release,\"  the   latter  term\n\n                    \n\n     1Cronkite  joined  as plaintiff  a  corporation that  he\nhoped  to  assist through  the sale  of  lot 8  and  named as\ndefendants two  former officers of  Maine National Bank.   He\nalso made other  claims in  addition to  breach of  contract.\nSince the presence of other parties does not affect the legal\nissue,  and the other claims have not been briefed on appeal,\nwe need not discuss the other parties or other claims.\n\n                             -3-\n\nencompasses the former and the settlement agreement should be\n\nread  as if  it said \"release  or subordinate.\"   At the very\n\nleast,  Cronkite says  that he  should have  been allowed  to\n\noffer extrinsic evidence.\n\n     Considering the  issue of interpretation de  novo, In re\n                                                             \n\nSPM Mfg. Corp, 984 F.2d 1305, 1311  (1st Cir. 1993), we agree\n             \n\nwith the magistrate judge's  reading.  It is sound  policy to\n\nread  commercial   documents   according  to   their   terms.\n\nSubordination may often have less severe consequences for the\n\nholder  of an interest than  does release, but  it is still a\n\ndifferent  legal  arrangement.   And  agreements relating  to\n\nloans  and  mortgages  are  instruments in  which  words  are\n\nnormally  used  with  some  precision.    If  one  begins  by\n\ndeparting from the plain  meaning of a familiar term  one may\n\nend by  enlarging the contract to  embrace transactions never\n\ncontemplated.   This case well illustrates  these precepts of\n\nconstruction.\n\n     The transaction that Cronkite  seeks to bring within the\n\n\"release\"  paragraph of  the  settlement agreement  is by  no\n\nmeans  the same  as  the  type  to  which  the  paragraph  is\n\ndirected.  In the  former case, the bank would  know not only\n\nthat  Cronkite was current in his obligations to the bank and\n\nhad  a net worth of 150 percent of his remaining obligations,\n\nbut also that he was selling the released property in \"a fair\n\nmarket  value  sale.\"   In  other  words,  his  secured  real\n\n                             -4-\n\nproperty  would  be  diminished  but he  would  increase  his\n\nimmediate net worth by the fair market value of the property,\n\ngiving the bank some additional protection.\n\n     In  the  subordination  transaction  proposed  to  Maine\n\nNational Bank,  Cronkite was  asking the bank  to subordinate\n\nits  interest not so that the  subordinated property could be\n\nsold but so that some other piece of property could be  sold.\n\nThere  is nothing in this arrangement to assure that the sale\n\nprice of the  property sold would be as high  as the value of\n\nthe property with respect to which Maine National Bank was to\n\nsubordinate its interest.   That bank could easily  find that\n\nit had given another  creditor a superior position on  a very\n\nvaluable piece of property so that Cronkite could make a sale\n\nof a much less valuable one.  It does not matter whether this\n\nwas or was not the case here.  The point is, rather, that the\n\ntransaction  is in  no sense  the one  to which the  bank had\n\ncommitted itself.\n\n      Under certain circumstances, extrinsic  evidence may be\n\nadmissible  to cast light on the intention of the parties and\n\nthe  meaning   of  their   agreement.    For   the  sake   of\n\ncompleteness,  we  note that  Cronkite  did  not in  opposing\n\nsummary  disposition  point to  any  extrinsic  evidence that\n\nwould  alter  the  result  even if  extrinsic  evidence  were\n\nadmissible.   Accordingly,  we have  no occasion  to consider\n\n                             -5-\n\nwhen  under Maine  law  extrinsic evidence  is admissible  in\n\ninterpreting written contracts.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -6-\n",

Cronkite's main argument is that since \"subordination\" is a lesser sacrifice of interest than a full \"release,\" the latter term encompasses the former and the settlement agreement should be read as if it said \"release or subordinate.\"  At the very least, Cronkite says that he should have been allowed to offer extrinsic evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the issue of interpretation  de novo, In re SPM Mfg. Corp, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599258\"><a href=\"/opinion/599258/in-re-spm-manufacturing-corporation-debtor-official-unsecured-creditors/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span>, 1311 (1st Cir. 1993), we agree with the magistrate judge's reading.  It is sound policy to read commercial documents according to their terms.  Subordination may often have less severe consequences for the holder of an interest than does release, but it is still a different legal arrangement.  And agreements relating to loans and mortgages are instruments in which words are normally used with some precision.  If one begins by departing from the plain meaning of a familiar term one may end by enlarging the contract to embrace transactions never contemplated.  This case well illustrates these precepts of construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The transaction that Cronkite seeks to bring within the \"release\" paragraph of the settlement agreement is by no means the same as the type to which the paragraph is directed.  In the former case, the bank would know not only that Cronkite was current in his obligations to the bank and had a net worth of 150 percent of his remaining obligations, but also that he was selling the released property in \"a fair market value sale.\"  In other words, his secured real property would be diminished but he would increase his immediate net worth by the fair market value of the property, giving the bank some additional protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the subordination transaction proposed to Maine National Bank, Cronkite was asking the bank to subordinate its interest not so that the subordinated property could be sold but so that some other piece of property could be sold.  There is nothing in this arrangement to assure that the sale price of the property sold would be as high as the value of the property with respect to which Maine National Bank was to subordinate its interest.  That bank could easily find that it had given another creditor a superior position on a very valuable piece of property so that Cronkite could make a sale of a much less valuable one.  It does not matter whether this was or was not the case here.  The point is, rather, that the transaction is in no sense the one to which the bank had committed itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under certain circumstances, extrinsic evidence may be admissible to cast light on the intention of the parties and the meaning of their agreement.  For the sake of completeness, we note that Cronkite did not in opposing summary disposition point to any extrinsic evidence that would alter the result even if extrinsic evidence were admissible.  Accordingly, we have no occasion to consider when under Maine law extrinsic evidence is admissible in interpreting written contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Cronkite joined as plaintiff a corporation that he hoped to assist through the sale of lot 8 and named as defendants two former officers of Maine National Bank.  He also made other claims in addition to breach of contract.  Since the presence of other parties does not affect the legal issue, and the other claims have not been briefed on appeal, we need not discuss the other parties or other claims</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
