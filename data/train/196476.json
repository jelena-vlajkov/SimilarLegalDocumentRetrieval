Each was\r\n\nacquitted.   Afterward, Lombard and Hartley  were indicted as\r\n\nco-defendants  in  the federal  district  court  in Maine  on\r\n\nfederal  firearms  and  other  charges  arising  out  of  the\r\n\nmurders.  Hartley pleaded  guilty at mid-trial, but appellant\r\n\nLombard entrusted his fate to the jury.  He was convicted.\r\n\n          At sentencing,  under the Guidelines,  the district\r\n\ncourt found by a  preponderance of the evidence  that Lombard\r\n\nhad used  his illegally possessed firearm  to commit \"another\r\n\noffense\":  the same murders of which he had been acquitted in\r\n\nthe  state court.   The resulting  Guidelines sentence  was a\r\n\nmandatory term of life  in prison, which Maine law  would not\r                     \r\n\nhave  required  even  had  defendant been  convicted  of  the\r\n\nmurders.   Lombard thus received a life sentence based on the\r\n\nfederal court's finding that it was more likely than not that\r\n\nLombard  had  committed  the murders  of  which  he  had been\r\n\nacquitted.   The  sentencing judge  was greatly  troubled but\r\n\nfelt  as  a matter  of law  that he  had  no authority  to do\r\n\notherwise under the Guidelines.\r\n\n          Lombard appeals the mandatory life sentence and his\r\n\nconvictions.    We affirm  the  convictions  for the  reasons\r\n\nstated later.  We address first the very troubling sentencing\r\n\nissue.   Finding  that  this  is a  case  in  which the  life\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nsentence  enhancement  is the  \"tail which  wags the  dog\" of\r\n\ndefendant's trial and conviction, thus raising constitutional\r\n\ndue process concerns, we hold that under section 5K2.0 of the\r\n\nGuidelines  the district  court had  the authority,  which it\r\n\nthought it had  not, to  consider a downward  departure.   We\r\n\nvacate the  life sentence and  remand for a  determination of\r\n\nwhether a downward departure might be warranted in the unique\r\n\ncircumstances here.\r\n\n                              I\r\n\n                          Background\r                                                \r\n\n          On Thanksgiving morning of 1990,  Morris Martin and\r\n\nPaul Lindsey, Jr. were murdered, each shot in the head as  he\r\n\nlay  sleeping in  the living  room of  a small  cabin  in the\r\n\nbackwoods of Fairfield, Maine.  The cabin was owned by Hubert\r\n\nHartley,  the half-brother  of the  defendant  Henry Lombard.\r\n\nAll four men had been living in the cabin  for a week to hunt\r\n\ndeer in  the surrounding  woods.  Tammy  Theriault, Hartley's\r\n\ngirlfriend, had also been living in the cabin, along with her\r\n\neighteen  month old  daughter.   She  was also  pregnant with\r\n\nHartley's child at the time.  Theriault was a near-eyewitness\r\n\nto the murders,  able to hear and observe much through a hole\r\n\nin the floor of her upstairs bedroom.\r\n\n          Lombard and Hartley were  tried separately on state\r\n\ncharges of  murder before  two juries in  the Maine  Superior\r\n\nCourt.   Each  defendant  testified in  his  own defense  and\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nclaimed that the  other had committed  the murders.   Hartley\r\n\nand  Theriault testified against  Lombard at Lombard's trial.\r\n\nBoth state trials resulted in acquittals.\r\n\n          One year  later, a  federal grand jury  returned an\r\n\nindictment in  the U.S. District Court,  charging Hartley and\r\n\nLombard  with unlawful  possession of  a firearm,  aiding and\r\n\nabetting the  same, and  with conspiracy charges  relating to\r\n\nthe aftermath  of  the murders.1   Lombard  and Hartley  were\r\n\ntried   jointly  in   the  federal   district  court.     The\r\n\nprosecution's key witness was Tammy Theriault.  Her testimony\r\n\ndeparted in  some respects from the  testimony and statements\r\n\nshe gave earlier.   She testified, as  follows, that although\r\n\nshe did not  see the  murders being committed,  she did  hear\r\n\nconversations  between Hartley  and Lombard  just before  and\r\n\nafter  the  gunshots  were  fired.    At  about  10  a.m.  on\r\n\nThanksgiving morning,  Lombard  and Hartley  returned to  the\r\n\ncabin from a morning hunt.  Martin and Lindsey were asleep on\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Count  1 of  the indictment  charged Hartley  and Lombard\r\nwith a multi-part  conspiracy with the following  objectives:\r\nunlawfully  to   possess  and  aid  and   abet  the  unlawful\r\npossession of  a firearm  and ammunition in  violation of  18\r\nU.S.C.   922(g)(1); to cross state lines with intent to avoid\r\nprosecution  or   avoid  giving  testimony   in  a   criminal\r\nproceeding  in violation of  18 U.S.C.   1073;  and to remove\r\nand  transport  from  Hartley's  cabin  certain  evidence  of\r\nLombard's unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition, in\r\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.   2232(a).   Count 2  charged Lombard\r\nwith  unlawful  possession of  a firearm  in violation  of 18\r\nU.S.C.     922(g),  924(e).   Count  3  charged Hartley  with\r\naiding and abetting  Lombard in the unlawful possession  of a\r\nfirearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1)-(2).\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncouches in the living room.   Hartley, seeing Theriault, told\r\n\nher to go back upstairs because he and Lombard \"had something\r\n\nto do.\"   On returning to her room, she  heard Lombard say to\r\n\nHartley,  \"[I]f you don't shoot  him, I'm going  to shoot 'em\r\n\nboth.\"    Next,  Theriault,  still  upstairs  with  her  baby\r\n\ndaughter, heard  five or six gunshots,  followed by Lombard's\r\n\nexclamation,  \"I didn't  think you  had the  guts to  do it.\"\r\n\nHartley boasted,  \"I  showed you,  didn't I?\"  and added,  \"I\r\n\ndon't think he's dead yet.  Shoot him again.\"\r\n\n          Lombard and Hartley stuffed the victims' bodies  in\r\n\ngarbage  bags, as Theriault  watched through the  hole in her\r\n\nbedroom floor.   Theriault  was with  Lombard and  Hartley as\r\n\nthey cleaned the cabin  of blood and other evidence,  and hid\r\n\nthe bodies temporarily  in the cellar.  The next  day, as the\r\n\ntwo men were  attempting to move  the bodies to the  trunk of\r\n\nHartley's   car,  Theriault's   family   arrived   to   bring\r\n\nThanksgiving  leftovers.   They  sat visiting  in the  living\r\n\nroom, with one victim's body hidden in the trunk of Hartley's\r\n\ncar  outside,  the  other still  in  the  cellar.   Theriault\r\n\naccompanied  Lombard and Hartley when they later went to dump\r\n\nboth bodies  in a roadside  bog.  She  was also present  when\r\n\nLombard  sold his  Marlin .22  caliber rifle  as well  as the\r\n\nvictims' two hunting guns  to a broker.  Lombard  and Hartley\r\n\nwere planning to flee from Maine to Massachusetts just before\r\n\nthey were arrested.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Excerpts of testimony that Hartley  and Lombard had\r\n\ngiven in their  state court murder trials were  also admitted\r\n\ninto evidence.  These excerpts (including Lombard's own prior\r\n\ntestimony)  corroborated  much  of  Theriault's  account  and\r\n\nestablished  that Lombard  owned a  Marlin .22  caliber rifle\r\n\nwhich he had brought to Hartley's cabin, that he loaded it on\r\n\nthe morning of Thanksgiving  Day, 1990, that he took  the gun\r\n\nwith him to  go hunting  that morning, and  that Lombard  and\r\n\nHartley   together  attempted  to   clean  the  bloody  cabin\r\n\nfollowing  the  murders,  removed  evidence  of  the murders,\r\n\ndisposed of  the  bodies, and  planned  to flee  from  Maine.\r\n\nOther  witnesses'  testimony  established  that  Lombard  had\r\n\nreason  to  be aware  that he  could  not lawfully  possess a\r\n\nfirearm, that he nonetheless  purchased the .22 caliber rifle\r\n\nfrom  Tammy Theriault's  brother, and  that the  bullets that\r\n\nwere recovered from the  victims' bodies were consistent with\r\n\nhaving been fired from a .22 caliber rifle. \r\n\n          Hartley  pleaded  guilty   at  the  close   of  the\r\n\ngovernment's case.   Lombard, however,  put his  case to  the\r\n\njury  (without  presenting  an   affirmative  case)  and  was\r\n\nconvicted on both Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment.\r\n\n          At Lombard's sentencing, the court applied a cross-\r\n\nreference  in  the  relevant  provision  of   the  Guidelines\r\n\ngoverning   the   firearms   conviction  (Count   2),   which\r\n\nessentially provided that  if Lombard's unlawfully  possessed\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nfirearm had been used in the commission of a murder, his base\r\n\noffense level (BOL)  on that conviction was to  be determined\r\n\nby the same guideline applicable  to a conviction for murder.\r\n\nThe court determined that the firearm had so been used.   The\r\n\nresulting  BOL  required a  term  of  life imprisonment,  and\r\n\nLombard was sentenced accordingly.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\n                         The Sentence\r                                                 \r\n\n          Lombard  raises  two  challenges  to  the  sentence\r\n\nimposed by the  district court.   He contends  that the  life\r\n\nsentence was imposed in violation of his rights under the Due\r\n\nProcess Clause.2  He  also argues, to  no avail, that he  was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  As  a  preliminary  matter, we  reject  the  government's\r\nassertion that  the defendant did not  properly preserve this\r\nissue  for appeal.  The issue of  whether and in what way the\r\nmurders of which Lombard had been acquitted could properly be\r\nconsidered  at  sentencing was  adequately  presented  to and\r\nsquarely  addressed  by the  district  court.   As  the court\r\nitself stated:\r\n\n           The  key issue in this  sentencing, of course,\r\n    is whether or  not premeditated murder is the  object\r\n    offense in  connection with  which the  firearms were\r\n    unlawfully possessed. . . .\r\n           Resolution  of  this   issue  is  particularly\r\n    difficult because  of the fact  that both defendants,\r\n    Mr. Lombard and Mr. Hartley, were acquitted of  first\r\n    degree murder  charges  in  the state  court  . . . .\r\n    The suggestion made by counsel for Mr. Lombard  quite\r\n    appropriately  is how  could  the  object offense  in\r\n    deriving   the   calculation   of   the   appropriate\r\n    guideline in determining  the sentence  in this  case\r\n    be  calculated on  the basis of crimes  for which the\r\n    defendant has been acquitted albeit in state court?\r\n           And  that's  the central  core issue  that has\r\n    been troubling me  throughout this process since  the\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nerroneously  denied  credit  under  the  Guidelines  for  his\r\n\nacceptance ofresponsibility forthe firearms andflight crimes.\r\n\nA.  Calculation of the Guidelines Sentence\r                                                      \r\n\n          Lombard received a life sentence  as a thrice-prior\r\n\nconvicted felon  ostensibly for his unlawful  possession of a\r\n\nfirearm  in violation of 18 U.S.C.    922(g) and 924(e).3  He\r\n\nwas sentenced to the  statutory maximum of 60 months  for the\r\n\nconviction on the conspiracy  count, concurrent with the life\r\n\nsentence.4  Lombard  does not contend here  that the district\r                                         \r\n\ncourt incorrectly  applied the Guidelines in  determining his\r\n\nlife sentence, but rather argues that the manner in which the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n    trial and  during  the  presentence  conferences  and\r\n    reviewing    the    presentence   report    and   the\r\n    transcripts.\r\n\n3.  Section 922(g)(1) provides: \"It shall be unlawful for any\r\nperson . . . who has been convicted in any court  of, a crime\r\npunishable  by imprisonment  for  a term  exceeding one  year\r\n. . . to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce,\r\nor  possess   in  or  affecting  commerce,   any  firearm  or\r\nammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has\r\nbeen shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce\r\n[paragraph structure omitted].\"\r\n    Section 924(e)(1) provides: \"In the case of  a person who\r\nviolates section 922(g) of this title and has  three previous\r\nconvictions  by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of\r\nthis title for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or\r\nboth, committed on occasions different from one another, such\r\nperson  shall be fined  not more than  $25,000 and imprisoned\r\nnot less  than fifteen years, and,  notwithstanding any other\r\nprovision of  law, the court  shall not suspend  the sentence\r\nof, or  grant a  probationary sentence  to, such  person with\r\nrespect to the conviction under section 922(g).\"\r\n\n4.  Lombard has  not appealed the sentence  on the conspiracy\r\nconviction.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nGuidelines, as applied by  the court, required it  to conduct\r\n\nits factfinding  and mandated the life  sentence violated his\r\n\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\n           The   specific   guideline   applicable   to   the\r\n\ndefendant's   firearms   conviction  is   U.S.S.G.    2K2.1.5\r\n\nSubsection (a)(2) of the 1990 version of section 2K2.1 sets a\r\n\nBOL  of 12  \"if the  defendant is  convicted under  18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  922(g)  . . . .\"6    The  \"cross-reference\"   provision  of\r\n\nsubsection (c)(2)  of  section 2K2.1 directs  that \"[i]f  the\r\n\ndefendant used  or possessed  the firearm in  connection with\r\n\ncommission  or attempted commission of another offense, apply\r\n\n  2X1.1  . .  .  in respect  to  that other  offense, if  the\r\n\nresulting  offense  level  is greater  than  that  determined\r\n\nabove.\"   U.S.S.G.   2K2.1(c)(2)  (Nov. 1990).   Treating the\r\n\nmurders as \"another offense,\"  and finding by a preponderance\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Although the November 1993  version of the Guidelines was\r\nin effect at the time  of Lombard's sentencing, the  district\r\ncourt applied the  1990 version, apparently  to avoid any  ex\r                                                                         \r\npost  facto concerns.  See United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n64, 66 n.1  (1st Cir. 1991).   The outcome (a  mandatory life\r\nsentence) would not have been different had any later version\r\nof  the  Guidelines  been  applied.    All  citations to  the\r\nGuidelines are to the 1990 version, unless otherwise noted.\r\n\n6.  An  unadjusted  BOL  of  12  (given  defendant's criminal\r\nhistory category of VI) would have translated into a sentence\r\nof 30-37 months.  However, because defendant was sentenced as\r\nan  armed career  criminal  under 18  U.S.C.   924(e),  which\r\nprovides for a 15-year minimum, his total offense level could\r\nnot  have  been   any  lower   than  34,   even  apart   from\r\nconsideration of the murders.  See U.S.S.G.   4B1.4(b)(3)(A).\r                                              \r\nThat offense  level would  have translated into  a Guidelines\r\nsentencing range of 262-327 months.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nof the evidence that  the defendant had committed  that other\r\n\noffense, the court applied section 2X1.1, which  directed the\r\n\ndefendant's BOL to be  set at \"[t]he base offense  level from\r\n\nthe  guideline  for the  object  offense  . . . .\"   U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2X1.1(a)  (Nov.  1990).   The  \"object  offense\" was  first\r\n\ndegree murder, to which a BOL of  43 attaches.7  See U.S.S.G.\r                                                                \r\n\n  2A1.1.    Finding  no  basis  for  awarding  acceptance-of-\r\n\nresponsibility credit, the  district court  assigned a  total\r\n\noffense  level of  43.   Because Lombard  was sentenced  as a\r\n\ncareer  criminal  under  18  U.S.C.    924(e),  there  was  a\r\n\nstatutory  minimum  of  15  years, but  no  stated  statutory\r\n\nmaximum  applicable; thus  no reduction  was  indicated under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.     5G1.1(a)   (which  requires   adjustment   of  a\r\n\nGuidelines sentence to comply  with the statutory maximum for\r\n\nthe offense of conviction).  The defendant's final Guidelines\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The same result would obtain under the current version of\r\nthe  Guidelines.   The  November  1991  amendment to  section\r\n2K2.1(c) created a specific provision for cases in which  the\r\nunderlying  offense  conduct is  found  to  have resulted  in\r\ndeath.   See  U.S.S.G.  App.  C,  amend.  374.    The  cross-\r                        \r\nreference, as amended, provides as follows:\r\n\n    (1)  If the defendant  used or possessed  any firearm\r\n    or ammunition  in connection with  the commission  or\r\n    attempted commission of another offense, . . . apply\r\n    . . .\r\n           (B)    if   death  resulted,  the   most\r\n           analogous offense guideline from Chapter\r\n           Two,  Part  A, Subpart 1  (Homicide), if\r\n           the resulting offense  level is  greater\r\n           than that determined above.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2K2.1(c)(1)(B) (Nov. 1995).\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nsentence  was  a mandatory  term of  life imprisonment.

The Life Sentence\r                                 \r\n\n          The  mandatory imposition of  a life  sentence here\r\n\nraises  questions  of  whether  such a  result  was  strictly\r\n\nintended by the Sentencing  Guidelines and whether the method\r\n\nfollowed  to   produce  that  result  comports with  the  Due\r\n\nProcess Clause.   Our focus is  on the process  by which  the\r\n\nresult was reached.  Lombard makes no claim, nor could he, on\r\n\nthe  facts here  that imposition  of a  life sentence  on him\r\n\n(accompanied by due process) would itself be unconstitutional\r\n\nunder the Eighth Amendment.   Harmelin v. Michigan, 501  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n957 (1991).  The life sentence  resulted from the convergence\r\n\nof  several doctrines  in sentencing  law,  each individually\r\n\nwell accepted, and none of which individually is questionable\r\n\nhere.   But just as folk  wisdom recognizes that the whole is\r\n\noften greater and different than simply the sum of its parts,\r\n\nthese  individual doctrines,  each reflecting  compromises in\r\n\nour criminal jurisprudence, in  this extreme case threaten in\r\n\ncombination to  erode rights  that the Constitution  does not\r\n\npermit to be compromised.\r\n\n          We take  as given that once  convicted, a defendant\r\n\nhas  no  right  under the  Due  Process  Clause  to have  his\r\n\nsentencing determination be confined to facts proved beyond a\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nreasonable  doubt.

As now-Justice\r                \r\n\nBreyer noted,  the Guidelines  evince a compromise  between a\r\n\npure   \"charge  offense\"   system  in  which   sentences  are\r\n\ndetermined based solely upon conduct  of which a defendant is\r\n\nconvicted, and  a \"real  offense\" system, in  which sentences\r\n\nare  fashioned  in  view   of  all  relevant  mitigating  and\r\n\naggravating factors surrounding the defendant's conduct.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nid.

The Tail That Wags the Dog\r                                                     \r\n\n          The  Supreme Court  decisions on  sentencing, while\r\n\ngenerally endorsing  rules that permit  sentence enhancements\r\n\nto be based on conduct not proved to the same degree required\r\n\nto support a conviction, have  not embraced the concept  that\r\n\nthose rules are free from constitutional constraints.  On the\r\n\ncontrary,  the  Court  has  cautioned  against  permitting  a\r\n\nsentence  enhancement to be the  \"tail which wags  the dog of\r\n\nthe substantive offense.\"  McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88.\r                                               \r\n\n          McMillan  involved  a challenge  to  a Pennsylvania\r                              \r\n\nstatute that  imposed a mandatory minimum  prison sentence of\r\n\nfive  years  for  a  defendant  found  at  sentencing   by  a\r\n\npreponderance of  the evidence  to have \"visibly  possessed a\r\n\nfirearm\" in connection with his  offense of conviction.   The\r\n\nCourt held that the  statute did not violate the  Due Process\r\n\nClause.    See  McMillan,   477  U.S.  at  92.   (\"[W]e  have\r                                    \r\n\nconsistently   approved   sentencing  schemes   that  mandate\r\n\nconsideration of  facts related  to the crime,  . . . without\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nsuggesting  that   those  facts  must  be   proved  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable  doubt.\"  (citation  omitted)).    The Court  did,\r\n\nhowever, take pains to place limits upon its holding:\r\n\n          [The challenged  statute] operates solely\r\n          to    limit   the    sentencing   court's\r\n          discretion in selecting  a penalty within\r\n          the range already available to it without\r\n          the special finding of visible possession\r\n          of  a  firearm.

The\r\n\ncircumstances of this case that have combined to produce this\r\n\neffect  raise  grave constitutional  concerns,  although each\r\n\ndoctrine  considered separately  might  not provoke  a second\r\n\nthought.  Cf. United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-\r                                                    \r\n\n96 (1st Cir. 1993) (circumstances that individually might not\r\n\nwarrant  appellate relief \"may  in the aggregate  have a more\r\n\ndebilitating effect\"  and that a cumulation  of circumstances\r\n\n\"may sometimes  have a logarithmic effect,  producing a total\r\n\nimpact  greater than  the arithmetic  sum of  its constituent\r\n\nparts\"), cert. denied, 114 S.

This other conduct   murder   was\r\n\nsurely of the  most serious sort, but exactly  the sort as to\r\n\nwhich our jurisprudence  normally requires the government  to\r\n\nmeet its  full burden of  proof.  When  put to that  proof in\r\n\nstate court,  the government failed.   The punishment imposed\r\n\nin view of this  other conduct far outstripped in  degree and\r\n\nkind the punishment Lombard would otherwise have received for\r\n\nthe offense  of conviction.  There was no safety valve, or so\r\n\nthought the trial judge, to adjust the Guidelines sentence of\r\n\nlife  imprisonment  to assure  consideration  of  the penalty\r\n\nimposed in light of the process followed.  And that, in turn,\r\n\nraises  questions as to  whether Lombard received,  as to his\r\n\nsentence, the process that the Constitution says was due.\r\n\n          While  we  discuss individual  concerns,  we stress\r\n\nthat it is the  interplay amongst these concerns which  is of\r\n\nimport,  and none  of these  concerns should  be examined  in\r\n\nisolation.  We  start with the  paramount seriousness of  the\r\n\nostensibly \"enhancing\" conduct at issue.   A charge of murder\r\n\nrepresents   the  very   archetype   of  conduct   that  \"has\r\n\nhistorically  been  treated   in  the  Anglo-American   legal\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\ntradition  as  requiring proof  beyond  a  reasonable doubt.\"\r\n\nMcMillan,  477  U.S.  at  90 (citation  and  quotation  marks\r                    \r\n\nomitted).  Thus, a  rule structure that bars conviction  of a\r\n\nfirearms charge  except on  proof beyond a  reasonable doubt,\r\n\nbut  then permits imposition of a life sentence upon proof of\r\n\na  murder by  a  preponderance of  the evidence  attaches, in\r\n\neffect, the  lesser procedural protections to  the issue that\r\n\nwould naturally be viewed as having the greater significance.\r\n\n          That anomaly is heightened  by the specific  manner\r\n\nin  which  the  Guidelines  operated here.    Unlike  certain\r\n\n\"relevant  conduct\"  guidelines   that  simply  call   for  a\r\n\ndeterminate increase in a  defendant's BOL based on specified\r\n\nfactual  findings, see, e.g., U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(b)(1) (calling\r                                        \r\n\nfor  two-level increase  in BOL  for drug  conviction upon  a\r\n\nfinding that a  firearm was  possessed), the  cross-reference\r\n\nprovision that was applied in this case, U.S.S.G.   2K2.1(c),\r\n\nrequired the district court to calculate Lombard's  BOL as if\r                                                                         \r\n\nhis offense  of conviction  had been  murder.   See  U.S.S.G.\r                                                               \r\n\n   2K2.1(c), 2X1.1 (Nov. 1990).8\r\n\n          Particularly in light of  the absence of any stated\r                                                                         \r\n\nstatutory  maximum for  the firearms  offense, see  18 U.S.C.\r                                                              \r\n\n  924(e),  the cross-reference  to  the  first-degree  murder\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  The current  version of the cross-reference  is even more\r\nexplicit, directing the court to apply,  in cases where death\r\nresulted  from the  defendant's  offense  conduct, \"the  most\r\nanalogous offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart\r\n1 (Homicide).\"  U.S.S.G.   2K2.1(c)(1)(B) (Nov. 1995).\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nguideline  essentially displaced  the lower  Guidelines range\r                                            \r\n\nthat otherwise would have applied.  As a result, the sentence\r\n\nto be imposed for Lombard's  firearms conviction was the same\r\n\nas  the sentence that would  have been imposed  for a federal\r\n\nmurder conviction:  a mandatory  term of  life.   Despite the\r\n\nnominal characterization  of the murders as  conduct that was\r\n\nconsidered in \"enhancing\"  or \"adjusting\" Lombard's  firearms\r\n\nconviction, the reality is that  the murders were treated  as\r\n\nthe gravamen of the offense.\r\n\n          As the enhancing conduct  in this case was serious,\r\n\nso  too was the \"enhancement.\"  Attribution of the murders to\r\n\nLombard  operated not merely to ratchet up his prison term by\r\n\nsome fractional  increment, but  rather wholly to  remove the\r\n\ndefendant's sentence  from  the term-of-years  continuum  and\r\n\ntransform it  into a life  sentence without  the prospect  of\r\n\nparole.   That punishment represents \"the  second most severe\r\n\npenalty known to the law,\" Harmelin, 501 U.S. 957, 996 (1991)\r                                               \r\n\n(Scalia,  J.).   It  qualitatively  differs  from any  lesser\r\n\nsentence in  resting upon a determination  that the \"criminal\r\n\nconduct is so atrocious that society's interest in deterrence\r\n\nand retribution wholly outweighs any considerations of reform\r\n\nor rehabilitation of the perpetrator.\"  Id. at 2719 (Stevens,\r                                                       \r\n\nJ.,  dissenting) (citation and  quotation marks omitted); see\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso  Helm v.

In\r                                              \r\n\nshort,  the  enhancement  at  issue not  only  increased  the\r\n\nduration of Lombard's sentence,  but placed his punishment on\r\n\nan entirely different order of severity.\r\n\n          This  qualitative  difference   between  the   life\r\n\nsentence  imposed and the  term of  years that  Lombard might\r\n\notherwise have received as  a prior offender (262-327 months)\r\n\nimplicates basic concerns of proportionality both between the\r\n\nenhancement  and base  sentence and  between the  offense and\r\n\npunishment as  a whole.   Even if these  concerns, considered\r\n\nalone, might not  rise fully to  the level of  constitutional\r\n\nsignificance, they  further distinguish  this case  from less\r\n\ntroubling ones.  The  comparative severity of the enhancement\r\n\ninvites scrutiny  of the  weight given  to factfinding as  to\r\n\nostensibly \"enhancing\" conduct (the murders) allocated to the\r\n\nsentencing  phase, with its looser procedural constraints and\r\n\nlesser  burden of  proof.    It  raises  the  danger  of  the\r\n\ndefendant's trial and conviction being turned into a means of\r\n\nachieving an  end that  could not  be achieved  directly: the\r\n\nimposition  of  a  life  sentence \"enhancement\"  based  on  a\r\n\nfederally unprosecutable murder.  In its interaction with the\r\n\nother concerns  we describe, there is also an issue as to the\r\n\nproportion  between  the  gravity  of  Lombard's  offense  of\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nconviction and the  severity of  his punishment.   If a  life\r\n\nsentence without  parole is  appropriate for murder,  in most\r\n\ninstances that  sentence might appear to  be harsh punishment\r\n\nfor  the unlawful  possession of  a rifle,  even by  a career\r\n\ncriminal.   While  one  may doubt  whether  there are  Eighth\r\n\nAmendment concerns9  lurking here, cf. Harmelin,  501 U.S. at\r                                                           \r\n\n997-1001 (Opinion of  Kennedy, J.), the harshness of the life\r\n\nsentence in relation to  the offense of conviction highlights\r\n\nthe need for rigorous inquiry.10\r\n\n          Without  impugning  the  principle  that  acquitted\r\n\nconduct  may  be  considered  in  determining  a  defendant's\r\n\nsentence, the  prior state  court acquittal presents  another\r\n\nconcern  in  its interaction  here.   Lombard  put  the Maine\r\n\ngovernment to its proof on the charges of murder against him,\r\n\nand a state court jury determined that reasonable doubt as to\r\n\nhis guilt persisted.  The federal prosecution followed on the\r\n\nheels of the acquittal.   As the particular murders  at issue\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  Interestingly, the  Constitution of  the  State of  Maine\r\ncontains  an  explicit   proportionality  guarantee:   \"[A]ll\r\npenalties  and  punishments  shall  be  proportional  to  the\r\noffence.\"    Me. Const.  art. I,    9.   Thus,  it is  a fair\r\nquestion whether the Maine  Constitution would have permitted\r\nthe  resulting  sentence here  if  Maine  had done  what  the\r\nfederal prosecution did.\r\n\n10.  It  bears  emphasis that  the  perceived  severity of  a\r\nsentence is not,  standing alone, a basis  for departing from\r\nthe Guidelines  sentencing range.  United  States v. Jackson,\r                                                                        \r\n30 F.3d 199, 203-04 (1st Cir. 1994).  Here, the  magnitude of\r\nthe  sentence enhancement is  of concern only  when viewed in\r\nits interaction with the other aspects of this case.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nwere outside the sphere  of the federal prosecutor's criminal\r\n\ncharging power as  to murder,11 Lombard was not  charged with\r\n\nmurder in the federal indictment; the murders themselves were\r\n\nnot  alleged by  the  government  to  be  an  object  of  the\r\n\ndefendants' conspiracy; and the  federal jury was required to\r\n\nmake no factual determination regarding the commission of the\r\n\nmurders.  Yet it  would ignore reality not to  recognize that\r\n\nthe  federal prosecution arose out  of and was  driven by the\r\n\nmurders,  and that  the prosecution  was well aware  that the\r\n\nSentencing  Guidelines would  require  consideration  of  the\r\n\nmurders at  sentencing.   This reality was  reflected in  the\r\n\nprosecution's statement at the pre-sentencing conference that\r\n\n\"it  was  quite clear  from  the beginning;  Mr.  Lombard was\r\n\nlooking  at a  life sentence.\"   The  government, by  its own\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  The  government conceded  at oral argument  that Lombard\r\nand  Hartley could  not have  been charged  under any  of the\r\nfederal  murder  statutes.   See,  e.g.,  18 U.S.C.     1111,\r                                                   \r\n2113(e), 2118(c)(2); 21 U.S.C.   848(e).  The murders did not\r\ntake  place   on  any  federal  installation,   were  not  in\r\nconnection  with the robbery of a federally insured bank or a\r\nrobbery involving  federally controlled substances,  nor were\r\ncommitted in  the course of a  continuing criminal enterprise\r\nas defined  by federal law.   Whether or not it  could do so,\r\nthe  fact is that Congress  has chosen not  to federalize the\r\nstate crime of murder in cases like Lombard's, and so has not\r\nauthorized reprosecution for murder  pursuant to the doctrine\r\nof separate sovereignties.  See  Abbate v. United States, 359\r                                                                    \r\nU.S. 187 (1959).  Thus, the issue raised is not one of Double\r\nJeopardy, nor, strictly speaking, of the reach of the federal\r\npower, but one of  Due Process: whether the sentencing  court\r\nis precluded  from considering that the Sentencing Guidelines\r\nas applied,  through  the vehicle  of  sentence  enhancement,\r\neffectively punishes  the defendant  for conduct as  to which\r\nthere exists  no statutory authorization  for the  government\r\neven to prosecute.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nwords, had intended  \"from the beginning\" that  consideration\r\n\nof the murders would result in a life sentence.\r\n\n          Through the post-trial  adjudication of the murders\r\n\nunder  a lesser  standard of  proof, the  federal prosecution\r\n\nobtained   precisely  the   result  that   the   Maine  state\r\n\nprosecutors attempted,  but failed,  to obtain.   The federal\r\n\nprosecution may well have done better.  The net effect of the\r\n\nGuidelines  attribution  of   the  murders   to  Lombard   as\r\n\nunderstood by the district court was to mandate imposition of\r                                                           \r\n\na life sentence.   This  was the maximum  that Lombard  could\r                                                    \r\n\nhave  received had he been  convicted of murder  in the Maine\r\n\nstate  court.   See  Me. Rev.

See State v. St.\r                                                                         \r\n\nPierre,  584  A.2d  618,  621-22 (Me.  1990)  (vacating  life\r                  \r\n\nsentence  and reducing sentence  to term  of 45  years, where\r\n\nalthough  defendant \"committed  a brutal murder,\"  the record\r\n\nfailed to \"establish behavior at the outermost portion of the\r\n\nrange  of  cruelty  that  would  constitute  the  aggravating\r\n\ncircumstances of  extreme cruelty\").12   In any event,  in no\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  If  Lombard had  been convicted of  murder in  the Maine\r\nstate court and received  a sentence of a  term of years,  he\r\nwould have been eligible to receive credit against time to be\r\nserved under the \"good  time\" provisions of state  law, which\r\nare   considerably  more   generous   than  similar   federal\r\nprovisions.  Compare Me. Rev. Stat.

Given  the magnitude  of  the  sentence\r\n\n\"enhancement,\" the seriousness of the  \"enhancing\" conduct in\r\n\nrelation  to the  offense  of conviction,  and the  seemingly\r\n\nmandatory  imposition  of  the  life  sentence,  this summary\r\n\nprocess  effectively  overshadowed  the  firearms  possession\r\n\ncharge  and  raises  serious   questions  as  to  the  proper\r\n\nallocation of  the procedural protections attendant  to trial\r\n\nversus sentencing.

The\r\ndefendant  had  been  convicted   as  a  participant  in  the\r\nconspiracy  that  caused  those  losses,  but  the  jury  had\r\ndeadlocked on  the substantive counts.

Certainly,\r                                                \r\n\nthere  had  been  no   acquittal.    Even  more  importantly,\r\n\nCarrozza's holding was based  on the explicit assumption that\r                    \r\n\nconsideration of the murders  would not necessarily result in\r                                                   \r\n\na life sentence.  In fact, the  district court had refused to\r\n\nconsider  the  uncharged  murders  in  sentencing  Patriarca,\r\n\ntroubled  by the prospect of exposing the defendant to a life\r\n\nsentence  on the  basis  of uncharged  conduct.   This  court\r\n\nrejected  the  premise  of  the  district  court's   concern,\r                                  \r\n\nexplaining that  Patriarca's offenses  of  conviction    RICO\r\n\nviolations    carried statutory  maximum sentences of  twenty\r                                                                         \r\n\nyears each.  See  Carrozza, 4 F.3d at 81.   But even so,  the\r                                      \r\n\npanel was  careful to  reserve decision  as to  whether there\r\n\nmight remain a basis  for concern if the district  court were\r\n\nto order Patriarca to serve consecutive twenty-year sentences\r                                                   \r\n\non  each  of  his   three  RICO  convictions,  the  practical\r\n\nequivalent of a life sentence.  The court openly acknowledged\r\n\nthat it was troubled by this potentiality:\r\n\n          At least one member of the panel believes\r\n          that serious  constitutional concerns may\r\n          arise   if   the   defendant   ultimately\r\n          receives  the   equivalent  of   a   life\r\n          sentence  on the ground of his connection\r\n          with a  murder  for  which he  was  never\r\n          indicted, tried or convicted by a jury.\r\n\nSee id. at 81 n.9.\r                   \r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\n          The situation hypothesized in Carrozza is closer to\r                                                            \r\n\nthe  one  we  face  here,  with  added  amplifying  elements.\r\n\nLombard was acquitted of  the murders by a state  court jury.\r                                 \r\n\nNonetheless he received  not just \"the  equivalent of a  life\r\n\nsentence\" based  on attribution  of the  murders, but  a true\r\n\nlife sentence, and  a mandatory  one at that.   Further,  the\r\n\nsentence  imposed may have been even more severe than what he\r\n\nwould have received had he been convicted in state court.  We\r\n\nbelieve,  as  did  \"at least  one  member  of  the panel\"  in\r\n\nCarrozza, that  the life sentence imposed  upon the defendant\r                    \r\n\nraises \"serious constitutional concerns.\"  Id.\r                                                          \r\n\n          These  concerns  are   reinforced  by  the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt's recent  discussion in Witte v. United  States, 115 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt. 2199 (1995).   The  Court framed its  analysis by  asking\r\n\nwhen  a  sentence  enhancement  can  properly  be  viewed  as\r\n\npunishment  for  the offense  of  conviction,  as opposed  to\r                           \r\n\npunishment  for  the  enhancing  conduct.    While  the  case\r                           \r\n\ninvolved a Double Jeopardy  and not a Due Process  challenge,\r\n\nits discussion is instructive here: if the life sentence that\r\n\nLombard received  can realistically  be viewed  as punishment\r\n\nfor the  murders, as opposed  to punishment for  the firearms\r               \r\n\noffense,   the  constitutional  difficulties  alluded  to  in\r\n\nMcMillan then come to the fore.\r                    \r\n\n          In  Witte, the  defendant had  been convicted  on a\r                               \r\n\nmarijuana charge,  then received  an enhanced prison  term in\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nview of certain cocaine-related \"relevant conduct\" considered\r\n\nat  sentencing.  Later, the defendant was prosecuted for that\r\n\nsame cocaine-related conduct.  He objected on double jeopardy\r\n\ngrounds, arguing that  he had already  been punished for  the\r                                                                    \r\n\ncocaine-related conduct by virtue of the sentence enhancement\r\n\nfollowing  the  marijuana  conviction.    The  Supreme  Court\r\n\ndisagreed and held  that the defendant  had been punished  in\r\n\nthe first prosecution only for the offense of conviction (the\r                                          \r\n\nmarijuana  charge),  even  though  the  sentencing court  had\r\n\nconsidered  the  cocaine-related conduct  in  calculating his\r\n\nsentence.  See  id. at 2207.  In so  concluding, however, the\r                               \r\n\nCourt  emphasized  that  the  sentence  for  the  defendant's\r\n\noffense of  conviction (the  marijuana charge) had  carried a\r\n\nstatutory maximum,  and the \"enhancement\" to  the defendant's\r\n\nsentence had  merely fixed the  term of imprisonment  at some\r\n\npoint closer to (but still below) that maximum:\r\n\n          The relevant  conduct provisions  of  the\r\n          Sentencing    Guidelines    . . .     are\r\n          sentencing  enhancement  regimes evincing\r\n          the judgment  that a  particular  offense\r\n          should receive  a more  serious  sentence\r\n          within  the authorized  range  if  it was\r                                                   \r\n          either  accompanied  by  or  preceded  by\r\n          additional criminal activity.

Ct.  at 2208  (emphases added,  some citations\r                 \r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          This   case   presents   precisely  the   troubling\r\n\nsituation  that Witte  makes  an effort  to distinguish:  the\r                                 \r\n\napplicable statutory sentencing range (fifteen years minimum,\r\n\nno  stated maximum)  is quite broad,  and the  enhancing role\r\n\nplayed  by   the  relevant  conduct      the  murders      is\r\n\ninordinately  significant.   The  effect  of considering  the\r\n\nmurders was not just to fix Lombard's sentence at some higher\r                           \r\n\npoint within a particular range delimited by Congress for the\r\n\nfirearms offense.15   Instead, the  Guidelines, combined with\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  This is  in striking contrast  to the case  of Lombard's\r\nco-defendant, Hartley.   After he pleaded guilty, Count  3 of\r\nthe indictment was  dismissed as to  him on the  government's\r\nmotion.  Hartley's  BOL of 12 as to Count  1, with a criminal\r\nhistory category of I, would have yielded a sentence of 10-16\r\nmonths. The district court  found that Hartley, like Lombard,\r\nwas  subject to  the  cross-reference  provision of  U.S.S.G.\r\n  2K2.1(c).   But,  as  the government  informed  us at  oral\r\nargument,  Hartley   who did not qualify as a career criminal\r\n  had the  benefit of  a five-year statutory  maximum on  his\r                                              \r\nconviction  under Count 1, see 18 U.S.C.   371, which is what\r                                          \r\nhe received after his plea.  (Had Count 3 not been dismissed,\r\nHartley  likely  would  have  been subject  to  the  ten-year\r                                                                         \r\nstatutory  maximum contained  in  18  U.S.C.   924(a)(2)  for\r\naiding  and  abetting  the  firearms  offense.)    Thus,  for\r\nHartley,   consideration  of   the  murders   under  U.S.S.G.\r\n  2K2.1(c)  only had  the effect  of increasing  his sentence\r\nfrom a base of 10-16 months to the  statutory maximum of five\r\nyears, even though Tammy Theriault's testimony indicated that\r\nHartley  shared at  least equal  blame  with Lombard  for the\r                                     \r\nmurders.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nthe  absence  of  a  stated  statutory  maximum,  essentially\r\n\nrequired  the  district  court  to  determine Lombard's  base\r\n\noffense level as if his offense of conviction had been first-\r                               \r\n\ndegree  murder.16    See  U.S.S.G.   2K2.1(c).    This  comes\r                                    \r\n\nperilously close,  we believe,  to punishing Lombard  for the\r                                                                     \r\n\nostensibly \"enhancing\" conduct, the murders.17\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.

We hold that a sentence of life imprisonment was not\r\n\nan inexorable outcome under the Guidelines, that this case is\r\n\nwithin the scope of section 5K2.0 which provides flexibility,\r\n\nand  that, under our  decision in Rivera,  the district court\r                                                    \r\n\nhad authority  to avoid any unfairness  in Lombard's sentence\r\n\nthrough the mechanism of downward departure.\r\n\n          The principles governing downward  departures under\r\n\nthe  Sentencing Guidelines  were comprehensively  outlined by\r\n\nthis court in United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942 (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1993),  and  we apply  its  teachings  here.   A  fundamental\r\n\npremise of the Sentencing  Guidelines is that \"each guideline\r\n\n. . .  carv[es] out  a 'heartland,'  a set  of  typical cases\r\n\nembodying   the  conduct  that   each  guideline  describes.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.

As the  Sentencing  Commission  itself\r\n\nrecognized,  however, some  cases will  involve circumstances\r\n\nthat make them atypical and  remove them from the \"heartland\"\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nof  a  guideline's literal  scope.   U.S.S.G.  Ch. 1,  Pt. A,\r\n\nintro.  comment.  (4)(b).   A case  that  falls outside  of a\r\n\nguideline's heartland \"is, by definition, an 'unusual  case'\"\r\n\nand therefore  a candidate for downward  or upward departure.\r\n\nRivera,  994 F.2d  at  947.   The  basic question,  then,  is\r                  \r\n\nsimply:  \"Does this  case fall within the 'heartland,'  or is\r\n\nit an unusual case?\"  Id. at 948.\r                                     \r\n\n          The  Sentencing Commission has  been explicit that,\r\n\nwith  several  notable  exceptions  not  applicable here,  it\r\n\n\"d[id] not intend to  limit the kinds of factors,  whether or\r\n\nnot  mentioned anywhere  else in  the guidelines,  that could\r\n\nconstitute  grounds   for  departure  in  an  unusual  case.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  Ch.  1,  Pt.  A,  intro.  comment.  (4)(b).     The\r\n\nGuidelines themselves recognize that  even if a case presents\r\n\nno  circumstances  specifically  identified   as  permissible\r\n\ngrounds  for departure,  the case  may still  be sufficiently\r\n\nunusual to warrant it:\r\n\n          Circumstances that  may warrant departure\r\n          from  the  guidelines  pursuant  to  this\r\n          provision cannot, by  their very  nature,\r\n          be comprehensively listed and analyzed in\r\n          advance.  The controlling decision  as to\r\n          whether and  to what extent departure  is\r\n          warranted can only be made by the courts.\r\n          . . .  Any case  may involve  factors  in\r\n          addition to  those identified  that  have\r\n          not been given  adequate consideration by\r\n          the  Commission.   Presence of  any  such\r\n          factor  may  warrant  departure  from the\r\n          guidelines, under  some circumstances, in\r\n          the discretion of the sentencing court.\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   5K2.0.   The  commentary to section  5K2.0 further\r\n\nprovides  that  even  where  various   single  circumstances,\r\n\nconsidered individually,  might be insufficient  to permit  a\r\n\nfinding  that a case is outside the heartland of a particular\r\n\nguideline, the presence of those circumstances in combination\r\n\nmight permit a different assessment:\r\n\n          The  Commission  does  not  foreclose the\r\n          possibility  of   an  extraordinary  case\r\n          that, because of a  combination of  . . .\r\n          characteristics  or  circumstances  [that\r\n          separately would  not warrant departure],\r\n          differs     significantly     from    the\r\n          \"heartland\"   cases    covered   by   the\r\n          guidelines in a  way that is important to\r\n          the  statutory  purposes  of  sentencing,\r\n          even though none  of the  characteristics\r\n          or       circumstances       individually\r\n          distinguishes the case.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   5K2.0,  comment.

See id. at 951.\r                           \r\n\n          Here, the  district court did  not consider whether\r\n\ndeparture would have been appropriate under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.\r\n\nAt Lombard's sentencing hearing, the district court expressed\r\n\nconsiderable  unease  at  the  sentence  of  mandatory   life\r\n\nimprisonment that  had resulted  from  its consideration,  as\r\n\nrequired   by   the   Guidelines,  of   Lombard's   acquitted\r\n\nconduct.19    The  government   asserted  at  the  sentencing\r\n\nhearing that the  Guidelines \"leave this court  in essence no\r                                                                         \r\n\ndiscretion  whatsoever  to   sentence  [Lombard]  below  life\r                                  \r\n\nimprisonment  [emphasis added].\"   The district court thought\r\n\nthat  it lacked authority  to impose any  sentence other than\r\n\nlife imprisonment.  The  court also did not consider  whether\r\n\nthe  constitutional questions  raised by  the  mandatory life\r\n\nsentence might warrant a finding that this case falls outside\r\n\nthe  heartland  of  the   applicable  guideline.    Thus,  we\r\n\nconclude, as did the court in Rivera, that the district court\r                                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n19.  For example, the district court worried: \"The problem is\r\nthat  th[is] scenario is very difficult for me to accept when\r\nthe  whole concept of our criminal justice system is based on\r\ninnocent until proven guilty, and when there is an acquittal,\r\nthere has been no proof of guilt.\"\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\nerroneously  believed  it had  no power  to deviate  from the\r\n\nsentence  indicated by a  straightforward application  of the\r\n\nGuidelines and \"did not  realize that it had the  legal power\r\n\nto    consider   [downward]   departure\"   in   the   special\r\n\ncircumstances presented.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 953.\r                                                \r\n\n          The facts and circumstances  of this case present a\r\n\nwhole greater than the  sum of its parts and  distinguish it,\r\n\nfrom a constitutional perspective, from other cases that have\r\n\ninvolved facially similar issues.  The specific question from\r\n\nthe perspective of the  Guidelines and under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0\r\n\nis whether these features of the case   e.g., the state court\r                                                        \r\n\nacquittal and the  fact that the federal  sentence may exceed\r\n\nany  state  sentence that  would  have attached  to  a murder\r\n\nconviction;  the  paramount  seriousness  of  the  \"enhancing\r\n\nconduct\";   the   magnitude   of   the   \"enhancement\";   the\r\n\ndisproportionality  between the sentence  and the  offense of\r\n\nconviction  as well as  between the enhancement  and the base\r\n\nsentence; and  the absence  of a  statutory  maximum for  the\r\n\noffense of conviction   taken in  combination, make this case\r\n\n\"unusual\" and remove it from the \"heartland\" of the guideline\r\n\n(  2K2.1)  that yielded  the mandatory  life sentence.   This\r\n\ncase is outside the \"heartland.\"\r\n\n          The  Sentencing  Commission  in   writing  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2K2.1(c)  was undoubtedly  aware  that the  cross-reference\r\n\nprovision might  in some  cases call  for a defendant's  base\r\n\n                             -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\noffense level to be determined by  reference to the guideline\r\n\ngoverning murder.

It\r                                                   \r\n\nseems  to   us  unlikely  that  the   Commission  could  have\r\n\nenvisioned the particular  combination of circumstances  that\r\n\nin  this case culminated  in the mandatory  life sentence and\r\n\nthe corresponding institutional concerns.\r\n\n          Whether  or not constitutional concerns were raised\r\n\nby these  circumstances, as  we think they  are, we  conclude\r\n\nthat their  combination here gave  the court power  to depart\r\n\nunder  U.S.S.G.    5K2.0.     That  the  application  of  the\r\n\nGuidelines  that produced  the mandatory  life sentence  does\r\n\nraise constitutional concerns only reinforces our conclusion.\r\n\nThis case  may be  viewed   virtually  by definition    as an\r\n\n\"unusual\"  one  falling  outside  the  heartland  of  section\r\n\n2K2.1(c).   To decide otherwise  would be to  assume that the\r\n\nCommission   intended   that  the   application   of  section\r\n\n2K2.1(c)'s  cross-reference  provisions  could,  even   in  a\r\n\nheartland   case,   produce    sentences   raising    serious\r                     \r\n\nconstitutional  issues.

It  is the conduct  for which\r\n\nthere has been no conviction  which raises the sentence  here\r\n\nto a life term, and then only by means of a finding by a mere\r\n\npreponderance  of the evidence.  Yet a  life term is the same\r\n\nsentence that  would have  been imposed for  a conviction  of\r\n\nmurder.  Giving unbridled effect here to the cross-referenced\r\n\nmurder  guideline would,  instead of  furthering the  goal of\r\n\ntreating like  cases alike, ignore the  very real differences\r\n\ninherent  in  our  system   of  criminal  justice  between  a\r\n\nconviction  for murder  based  on proof  beyond a  reasonable\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\ndoubt and a  firearms conviction enhanced  by a finding  that\r\n\nguns  were  used  to  commit  the  same  murder  based  on  a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence.  Cf. Gigante, 39 F.3d at 47-48\r                                                       \r\n\n(characterizing   preponderance  standard  as  a  mere  \"tie-\r\n\nbreaker\" for evenly balanced evidence).  Viewing this case as\r\n\nfalling outside the heartland  of section 2K2.1(c) seems more\r\n\nconsistent  with  the  sentencing goals  set  by  Congress.20\r\n\nSee LaBonte,    F.3d at   , slip. op. at 24.\r                       \r\n\n          The  Guidelines were not  meant to  have foreclosed\r\n\nthe district court from considering a section 5K2.0  downward\r\n\ndeparture here.   Cf. United States v. Cuevas-Gomez,  61 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n749,  750 (9th  Cir.  1995) (noting  that automatic  16-level\r\n\nsentence  enhancement for  certain defendants  under U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2L1.2(b)(2) averts due process problems \"precisely because\"\r\n\nthe district court has discretion to consider departure based\r\n\non  the individual facts of the case).  Certainly, a downward\r\n\ndeparture here would not be forbidden.   See id.; Concepcion,\r                                                                        \r\n\n983  F.2d at  389.    Had  such  a  downward  departure  been\r\n\nconsidered,  the impact  of giving  sentencing weight  to the\r\n\nacquitted murders  could have  been tempered by  the district\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n20.  Of course, where the text of an  applicable guideline is\r\nclear, the sentencing court  may not rely upon its  own views\r\nabout the purposes of sentencing nor upon a personal sense of\r\ninequity  to deviate  from the  Guidelines  sentencing range.\r\nSee, e.g., United  States v.  Talladino, 38  F.3d 1255,  1265\r                                                   \r\n(1st Cir. 1994).  Here the sentencing policies articulated by\r\nCongress strengthen the analysis  of why the unusual features\r\nof this case warrant consideration of a downward departure.\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\ncourt's  fact-based, discretionary  judgment.   That judgment\r\n\nwould have been  informed by the background principle  that a\r\n\nsentence enhancement may  not function as a  \"tail which wags\r\n\nthe dog\" of the defendant's offense of conviction.\r\n\n          The  approach  adopted  here  is  similar  to  that\r\n\nadopted  by the Second Circuit, which  has used the mechanism\r\n\nof downward departure  to resolve a situation similar to this\r\n\none.    In  United  States   v.  Concepcion,  one  of   three\r                                                       \r\n\ncodefendants (Frias)  was convicted on a  firearms charge but\r\n\nacquitted  of  a drug  conspiracy  charge.   On  the firearms\r\n\ncharges  alone, the  defendant's guidelines  sentencing range\r\n\nwould have  been 12-18 months.   Applying the cross-reference\r\n\nin U.S.S.G.    2K2.1 (the same provision at  issue here), the\r\n\ndistrict  court had  found  that the  defendant actually  had\r\n\nengaged  in the  acquitted conduct,  and thus  determined his\r\n\nbase  offense  level with  reference  to that  conduct.   The\r\n\nresult  was  a  24-level  upward  adjustment,  with  a  final\r\n\nGuidelines sentencing range of  210-262 months.  983 F.2d  at\r\n\n389.\r\n\n          The  Second  Circuit,  reviewing   settled  circuit\r\n\nprecedent, held that the  district court had properly applied\r\n\nthe  Guidelines,  and  that  the  defendants'  constitutional\r\n\nrights  had not  been violated  by the  consideration of  the\r\n\nacquitted conspiracy charge.  Yet the court expressed serious\r\n\ndiscomfort with  the magnitude  of  the sentence  enhancement\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\nthat had resulted.  It observed: \"we doubt that, with respect\r\n\nto  conduct  of  which   the  defendant  was  acquitted,  the\r\n\n[Sentencing]  Commission intended  so  extreme an  increase.\"\r\n\nId.;21 see also  United States v.  Monk, 15 F.3d 25,  26, 28-\r                                                   \r\n\n29  (2d  Cir.  1994).    The  court  concluded  that  in  the\r\n\ncircumstances  of  that  case,  a  downward  departure  under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    5K2.0 might  well have  been warranted.   Because\r\n\n\"the  [district]  court  apparently  [had]  not  consider[ed]\r\n\nwhether such a departure was permissible,\" the Second Circuit\r\n\nvacated the  sentence and remanded  for further  proceedings.\r\n\nId.22\r               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n21.  Concurring,  Judge  Newman expressed  his own  view more\r\nsharply:\r\n\n     Under  the  rigor of  the  current  Guidelines, the\r\n     sentencing judge is required to assess  evidence of\r\n     relevant misconduct,  notwithstanding an acquittal,\r\n     and,  if  persuaded  by  a  preponderance  of   the\r\n     evidence  that  such   misconduct  occurred,   must\r\n     enhance the sentence according to the same scale of\r\n     severity that would have applied  had the defendant\r\n     been  convicted  of the  misconduct.  . . .   Thus,\r\n     after  [defendant]  was tried  for  the  conspiracy\r\n     offense and acquitted,  he faces virtually the same\r\n     sentence that  he would  have received had  he been\r\n     convicted! . . . When  the Guidelines and  the case\r\n     law implementing  them permit such a  result, it is\r\n     high time for both the Commission and the courts to\r\n     give  serious reconsideration to the decisions that\r\n     underlie this outcome.\r\n\n983 F.2d at 395 (Newman, J., concurring) (paragraph structure\r\nomitted).\r\n\n22.  On remand, the district court determined that a downward\r\ndeparture   was  indeed   appropriate  and   resentenced  the\r\ndefendant to  a term of  144 months.   This new sentence  was\r\naffirmed.  See United States v.  Frias, 39 F.3d 391, 392  (2d\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\n          On  the facts here, we are not as confident, as was\r\n\nthe   Second  Circuit  in   Concepcion,  that   the  sentence\r                                                  \r\n\nenhancement  at issue  passes constitutional  muster.   We do\r\n\nshare the doubts  of the Second  Circuit that the  Sentencing\r\n\nCommission  could have  foreseen the  kinds  of circumstances\r\n\nwhich in this case have coalesced to produce a mandatory life\r\n\nsentence,  and  we  agree  that  in  these  circumstances,  a\r\n\ndownward  departure  under U.S.S.G.    5K2.0  was  within the\r\n\ncourt's discretion.\r\n\n          This case presents  difficult and delicate  issues,\r\n\nnot  now susceptible  of articulation through  general rules.\r\n\nOur  concerns have  arisen from  a situation  where acquitted\r\n\nconduct  calling  for  the challenged  sentence  increase  is\r\n\nitself very serious conduct,  substantively more serious than\r\n\nthe  offense  with   which  defendant   was  charged,   where\r\n\nconsideration  of  that  conduct  resulted  in   an  enormous\r\n\nincrease23  in the  sentence  (including possibly  beyond the\r\n\nsentence  that would  have  been imposed  for a  conviction),\r\n\nwhere the ultimate sentence is itself enormous, and where the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nCir. 1994)  (per  curiam),  cert. denied,  115  S.

Whether  an  increase in  a  sentence is  enormous  is a\r\nmatter  of  degree,  not resolved  simply  by  the  labels of\r\nratios,  percentages, or the like.  For example, no one would\r\ndeny the real  difference between an  increase of a  sentence\r\nfrom one  year to three years  and an increase from  20 to 60\r\nyears,  even  though  each  represents  an  increase  of  300\r\npercent.\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\njudge  is seemingly mandated to impose that sentence.  Such a\r\n\nsituation  increases the risk that what the judge is required\r\n\nto and  in fact is  sentencing the  defendant for is  not the\r\n\nconvicted  offense  as  enhanced  by  relevant  conduct,  but\r\n\ndirectly for conduct as  to which the defendant has  not been\r\n\ncharged, tried by  a jury,  nor convicted on  proof beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt.  See Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d at 1001.\r                                               \r\n\n          The concerns  which  the district  court  expressed\r\n\nhere  are valid, and  we have tried to  state the reasons for\r\n\nthose concerns, and forcefully  so.  But we also  stress that\r\n\nthis is an extreme case.  Absent the special circumstances we\r\n\nhave highlighted here, no comparable concerns would be raised\r\n\nby cases involving even  sizeable sentence increases based on\r\n\nan  uncharged  quantity  of   drugs,  see  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCastellone,  985 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1993), an uncharged or\r                      \r\n\nacquitted  firearms offense, see  United States  v.

The outcome we adopt here\r\n\nshould  not  be  understood  as  an  invitation  to  litigate\r\n\nconstitutional or departure  issues in usual cases  involving\r\n\nsentence   enhancements  based  on   uncharged  or  acquitted\r\n\nconduct.

Hartley's Prior Testimony  from\r                                                          \r\n                         Lombard's       State\r                                                          \r\n               Trial\r                                \r\n\n          Approximately 60 pages  of Hartley's testimony from\r\n\nLombard's  state trial  were admitted,  containing statements\r\n\nabout Lombard's ownership of  the .22 caliber rifle; cleaning\r\n\nthe cabin of blood; disposal of the bodies; Lombard's sale of\r\n\nfirearms to a  broker; and Hartley's  and Lombard's plans  to\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\nflee.   Hartley had also  testified that Lombard  told him on\r\n\nthe  morning of the murders that Hartley \"didn't have to take\r\n\nno  shit  from nobody\";  that  Lombard  and Hartley  on  that\r\n\nThanksgiving morning  saw Martin  and  Lindsey (the  victims)\r\n\nsleeping on  couches in the  living room of  Hartley's cabin;\r\n\nand  that Lombard had, after the  murders, threatened to kill\r\n\nHartley and Theriault if  they did not \"stick\" to  their plan\r\n\nto  tell police, if questioned,  that they had  last seen the\r\n\ntwo victims on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.\r\n\n          Hartley's  prior  testimony  from  Lombard's  state\r\n\ntrial was  admitted under  the former testimony  exception to\r\n\nthe  hearsay  rule,  see   Fed.  R.  Evid.  804(b)(1),  which\r                                    \r\n\nprovides:\r\n\n          The  following [is]  not excluded  by the\r\n          hearsay   rule   if   the   declarant  is\r\n          unavailable as a witness:\r\n\n               (1)  Testimony  given  as  a  witness  at\r\n               another  hearing   of  the   same  or   a\r\n               different proceeding, . . . if  the party\r\n               against   whom   the  testimony   is  now\r\n               offered  . . .  had  an  opportunity  and\r\n               similar motive to  develop the  testimony\r\n               by    direct,    cross,    or    redirect\r\n               examination.\r\n\n          The other  conditions clearly being  met, the  only\r\n\nquestion is whether Lombard had \"similar motive\" at his state\r\n\ntrial  to   \"develop\"  Hartley's  testimony   through  cross-\r\n\nexamination.\r\n\n          The  party  against  whom  the prior  testimony  is\r\n\noffered  must   have  had  a  similar,   not  necessarily  an\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\nidentical,  motive to  develop the  adverse testimony  in the\r                     \r\n\nprior proceeding.   See  United States v.  Salerno, 505  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n317, 326  (1992) (1992) (Blackmun, J.,  concurring).  Because\r\n\nLombard faced both liability as to murder and as to  being an\r\n\naccomplice  to murder under Maine law, he had a very forceful\r\n\ninterest at his state trial in attacking Hartley's testimony,\r\n\nin order to discredit his account of the actual killings, the\r\n\nconcealing of evidence and the attempt to escape prosecution.\r\n\nThis interest  could hardly  have been  any  stronger at  the\r\n\nfederal trial, see  United States  v. DiNapoli,  8 F.3d  909,\r                                                          \r\n\n914-15  (2d Cir. 1993) (en  banc), and the  testimony, to the\r\n\nextent it related  to the events preceding  and following the\r\n\nmurders, was properly admitted.\r\n\n          Hartley's  prior  testimony  from  Lombard's  trial\r\n\nconcerning the .22 caliber rifle presents a different  set of\r\n\nissues.  In contrast to the federal trial, Lombard had little\r\n\nreal  incentive  at  his  state  trial  to  attack  Hartley's\r\n\nstatements concerning possession  or ownership of  the rifle.\r\n\nBut Lombard himself  admitted during  the course  of his  own\r                                         \r\n\ndirect  examination at his  state trial that  the .22 caliber\r                  \r\n\nrifle belonged to him.   Furthermore, other properly admitted\r\n\nevidence,  including Tammy Theriault's testimony that Lombard\r\n\nowned  the rifle, strongly  corroborated Lombard's admission.\r\n\nThus, under the circumstances  presented here, we believe any\r\n\n                             -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\nerror arising from the admission of this portion of Hartley's\r\n\nprior testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n          Admission  of  Hartley's   former  testimony   from\r\n\nLombard's state  trial  did  not  violate  the  Confrontation\r\n\nClause.    See  U.S.  Const.  amend.  VI  (\"In  all  criminal\r                          \r\n\nprosecutions,  the accused shall enjoy the  right . . . to be\r\n\nconfronted  with the  witnesses against  him.\").   The Clause\r\n\nrestricts  but   does  not  proscribe  the   admission  of  a\r\n\ndeclarant's  prior testimony  against  a criminal  defendant,\r\n\nrequiring only  that the declarant be  \"unavailable\" and that\r\n\nthe prior  testimony sought  to be admitted  \"bear[] adequate\r\n\n'indicia  of reliability,'\"  e.g.,  by  \"fall[ing]  within  a\r                                             \r\n\nfirmly rooted  hearsay exception.\"  See Ohio  v.

See Mattox v.

The co-conspirator  exception could not  have applied to\r\nthe  former  testimony,  because   the  conspiracy  had  been\r\nterminated at least by the date that the co-conspirators were\r\narrested.   See United States v. Palow,  777 F.2d 52, 57 (1st\r                                                  \r\nCir. 1985) (\"[I]t  is beyond doubt that  the challenged post-\r\narrest  statements  were  not  made  in  furtherance  of  the\r\nconspiracy.\"), cert.  denied, 475 U.S. 1052  (1986); see also\r                                                                         \r\nKrulewitch v.

See United States  v.

See United States  v. Olano,  113 S. Ct.\r                                                            \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nadmissible under the co-conspirator  exception).  Also, since\r\nLombard  was neither  present  nor represented  at  Hartley's\r\nstate  trial  and had  no  opportunity  to cross-examine  him\r\nthere, the testimony was not admissible under Rule 804(b)(1).\r\n    Admission of the  sidebar statement by Hartley's  counsel\r\nas to what he believed  his client was about to say  presents\r\ndifficulties as  well, for other reasons.   Cf. United States\r                                                                         \r\nv.  Harris, 914 F.2d 927, 930-31 (7th Cir. 1990).

It is doubtful,  though, whether this  rule would\r\napply to  such an offer of  proof by counsel at  sidebar.  In\r\nany event, even if  the rule properly applied, it  would only\r\nmake the statements admissible against Hartley, not  Lombard.\r\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D) (statement by  a party's agent\r               \r\nis only admissible against that party).\r\n\n26.  The  defendant's only  contemporaneous objection  to the\r\ntestimony at trial  was limited to  specific language in  the\r\ntranscript  of the  earlier proceeding.   This  objection was\r\nobviated when the  district court ordered the language  to be\r\nredacted before the testimony was admitted.\r\n\n                             -51-\r                                          51\r\r\n\n1770, 1778 (1993).  Theriault's testimony, as well as that of\r\n\nher mother, independently established Hartley's  knowledge of\r\n\nLombard's status  as a  convicted felon, and  Lombard himself\r\n\nstipulated to having  committed prior felonies.27   Admission\r\n\nof  the challenged evidence was not plain error, and there is\r\n\nno basis for reversal.

Evid. 403, because the prejudicial impact of that evidence\r\n\noutweighed its probative value.\r\n\n          Lombard preserved his Rule 403 objection  only with\r\n\nrespect  to  the Theriault  testimony.   He  has not  met his\r\n\nburden  of showing an abuse of discretion in the admission of\r\n\nthat testimony.   See Abreu, 952 F.2d at 1467.  A decision by\r                                       \r\n\nthe district  court on  a Rule  403 determination  must stand\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n27.  Because Hartley's testimony from  his own previous trial\r\nwas introduced for the purpose of proving Hartley's knowledge\r\nof  Lombard's status as a  felon, and not  for the purpose of\r\nproviding the jury with  unnecessary details about  Lombard's\r\nstipulated prior  felonies, there  was no error  under United\r                                                                         \r\nStates v.

There  are no  such\r\n\ncircumstances here.\r\n\n          That  Lombard posed  no Rule  403 objection  to the\r\n\nadmission  of Hartley's  and  even his  own former  testimony\r                                                       \r\n\nabout  the  murders undercuts  his  objection  to Theriault's\r\n\ntestimony.    Her  testimony  about  Hartley's and  Lombard's\r\n\nconduct in connection with  the murders was at  least equally\r\n\nrelevant.     One  of  the  objectives   of  the  defendants'\r\n\nconspiracy charged was to  \"flee the State of Maine  in order\r\n\nto avoid prosecution or the giving of testimony in connection\r\n\nwith the  homicides of Morris  Martin and Paul  Lindsey, Jr.\"\r\n\nThe indictment also charged  that the defendants conspired to\r\n\n\"dispose of  certain evidence of Henry  P.

Each was acquitted.  Afterward, Lombard and Hartley were indicted as co-defendants in the federal district court in Maine on federal firearms and other charges arising out of the murders.  Hartley pleaded guilty at mid-trial, but appellant Lombard entrusted his fate to the jury.  He was convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, under the Guidelines, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Lombard had used his illegally possessed firearm to commit \"another offense\":  the same murders of which he had been acquitted in the state court.  The resulting Guidelines sentence was a mandatory term of life in prison, which Maine law would not have required even had defendant been convicted of the murders.  Lombard thus received a life sentence based on the federal court's finding that it was more likely than not that Lombard had committed the murders of which he had been acquitted.  The sentencing judge was greatly troubled but felt as a matter of law that he had no authority to do otherwise under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard appeals the mandatory life sentence and his convictions.  We affirm the convictions for the reasons stated later.  We address first the very troubling sentencing issue.  Finding that this is a case in which the life sentence enhancement is the \"tail which wags the dog\" of defendant's trial and conviction, thus raising constitutional due process concerns, we hold that under section 5K2.0 of the Guidelines the district court had the authority, which it thought it had not, to consider a downward departure.  We vacate the life sentence and remand for a determination of whether a downward departure might be warranted in the unique circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Thanksgiving morning of 1990, Morris Martin and Paul Lindsey, Jr. were murdered, each shot in the head as he lay sleeping in the living room of a small cabin in the backwoods of Fairfield, Maine.  The cabin was owned by Hubert Hartley, the half-brother of the defendant Henry Lombard.  All four men had been living in the cabin for a week to hunt deer in the surrounding woods.  Tammy Theriault, Hartley's girlfriend, had also been living in the cabin, along with her eighteen month old daughter.  She was also pregnant with Hartley's child at the time.  Theriault was a near-eyewitness to the murders, able to hear and observe much through a hole in the floor of her upstairs bedroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard and Hartley were tried separately on state charges of murder before two juries in the Maine Superior Court.  Each defendant testified in his own defense and claimed that the other had committed the murders.  Hartley and Theriault testified against Lombard at Lombard's trial.  Both state trials resulted in acquittals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One year later, a federal grand jury returned an indictment in the U.S. District Court, charging Hartley and Lombard with unlawful possession of a firearm, aiding and abetting the same, and with conspiracy charges relating to the aftermath of the murders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Lombard and Hartley were tried jointly in the federal district court.  The prosecution's key witness was Tammy Theriault.  Her testimony departed in some respects from the testimony and statements she gave earlier.  She testified, as follows, that although she did not see the murders being committed, she did hear conversations between Hartley and Lombard just before and after the gunshots were fired.  At about 10 a.m. on Thanksgiving morning, Lombard and Hartley returned to the cabin from a morning hunt.  Martin and Lindsey were asleep on couches in the living room.  Hartley, seeing Theriault, told her to go back upstairs because he and Lombard \"had something to do.\"   On returning to her room, she heard Lombard say to Hartley, \"[I]f you don't shoot him, I'm going to shoot 'em both.\"   Next, Theriault, still upstairs with her baby daughter, heard five or six gunshots, followed by Lombard's exclamation, \"I didn't think you had the guts to do it.\"   Hartley boasted, \"I showed you, didn't I?\" and added, \"I don't think he's dead yet.  Shoot him again.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard and Hartley stuffed the victims' bodies in garbage bags, as Theriault watched through the hole in her bedroom floor.  Theriault was with Lombard and Hartley as they cleaned the cabin of blood and other evidence and hid the bodies temporarily in the cellar.  The next day, as the two men were attempting to move the bodies to the trunk of Hartley's car, Theriault's family arrived to bring Thanksgiving leftovers.  They sat visiting in the living room, with one victim's body hidden in the trunk of Hartley's car outside, the other still in the cellar.  Theriault accompanied Lombard and Hartley when they later went to dump both bodies in a roadside bog.  She was also present when Lombard sold his Marlin .22 caliber rifle as well as the victims' two hunting guns to a broker.  Lombard and Hartley were planning to flee from Maine to Massachusetts just before they were arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Excerpts of testimony that Hartley and Lombard had given in their state court murder trials were also admitted into evidence.  These excerpts (including Lombard's own prior testimony) corroborated much of Theriault's account and established that Lombard owned a Marlin .22 caliber rifle which he had brought to Hartley's cabin, that he loaded it on the morning of Thanksgiving Day, 1990, that he took the gun with him to go hunting that morning, and that Lombard and Hartley together attempted to clean the bloody cabin following the murders, removed evidence of the murders, disposed of the bodies, and planned to flee from Maine.  Other witnesses' testimony established that Lombard had reason to be aware that he could not lawfully possess a firearm, that he nonetheless purchased the .22 caliber rifle from Tammy Theriault's brother, and that the bullets that were recovered from the victims' bodies were consistent with having been fired from a .22 caliber rifle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartley pleaded guilty at the close of the government's case.  Lombard, however, put his case to the jury (without presenting an affirmative case) and was convicted on both Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Lombard's sentencing, the court applied a cross-reference in the relevant provision of the Guidelines governing the firearms conviction (Count 2), which essentially provided that if Lombard's unlawfully possessed firearm had been used in the commission of a murder, his base offense level (BOL) on that conviction was to be determined by the same guideline applicable to a conviction for murder.  The court determined that the firearm had so been used.  The resulting BOL required a term of life imprisonment, and Lombard was sentenced accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>The Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard raises two challenges to the sentence imposed by the district court.  He contends that the life sentence was imposed in violation of his rights under the Due Process Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He also argues, to no avail, that he was erroneously denied credit under the Guidelines for his acceptance of responsibility for the firearms and flight crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Calculation of the Guidelines Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard received a life sentence as a thrice-prior convicted felon ostensibly for his unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 922(g) and 924(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He was sentenced to the statutory maximum of 60 months for the conviction on the conspiracy count, concurrent with the life sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Lombard does not contend here that the district court incorrectly applied the Guidelines in determining his life sentence, but rather argues that the manner in which the Guidelines, as applied by the court, required it to conduct its factfinding and mandated the life sentence violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific guideline applicable to the defendant's firearms conviction is U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Subsection (a)(2) of the 1990 version of section 2K2.1 sets a BOL of 12 \"if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The \"cross-reference\" provision of subsection (c)(2) of section 2K2.1 directs that \"[i]f the defendant used or possessed the firearm in connection with commission or attempted commission of another offense, apply Sec. 2X1.1 ... in respect to that other offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c)(2) (Nov. 1990).  Treating the murders as \"another offense,\" and finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had committed that other offense, the court applied section 2X1.1, which directed the defendant's BOL to be set at \"[t]he base offense level from the guideline for the object offense....\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2X1.1(a) (Nov. 1990).  The \"object offense\" was first degree murder, to which a BOL of 43 attaches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2A1.1.  Finding no basis for awarding acceptance-of-responsibility credit, the district court assigned a total offense level of 43.  Because Lombard was sentenced as a career criminal under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e), there was a statutory minimum of 15 years, but no stated statutory maximum applicable;  thus no reduction was indicated under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.1(a) (which requires adjustment of a Guidelines sentence to comply with the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction).  The defendant's final Guidelines sentence was a mandatory term of life imprisonment.  See U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (assigning life sentence to BOL of 43 for all criminal history categories).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Life Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mandatory imposition of a life sentence here raises questions of whether such a result was strictly intended by the Sentencing Guidelines and whether the method followed to produce that result comports with the Due Process Clause.  Our focus is on the process by which the result was reached.  Lombard makes no claim, nor could he, on the facts here that imposition of a life sentence on him (accompanied by due process) would itself be unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.  Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991).  The life sentence resulted from the convergence of several doctrines in sentencing law, each individually well accepted, and none of which individually is questionable here.  But just as folk wisdom recognizes that the whole is often greater and different than simply the sum of its parts, these individual doctrines, each reflecting compromises in our criminal jurisprudence, in this extreme case threaten in combination to erode rights that the Constitution does not permit to be compromised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take as given that once convicted, a defendant has no right under the Due Process Clause to have his sentencing determination be confined to facts proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986);  United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.1994).  A sentencing court's operative factfinding is generally subject only to a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard.  See United States v. LaCroix, 28 F.3d 223, 231 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 441 (1st Cir.1989).  But cf. United States v. Kikumura, 918 F.2d 1084, 1102 (3d Cir.1990) (holding that \"clear and convincing\" standard applies in certain limited circumstances).  Nor is a sentencing court limited to considering only the conduct of which the defendant was formally charged or convicted.  Even before the advent of the Guidelines, some sentencing courts took into account any information known to them, including uncharged relevant conduct.  See, e.g., Nichols v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 1928, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994);  Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949);  United States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 387-88 (2d Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 163, 126 L.Ed.2d 124 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines were not intended to discontinue the courts' historical practice of considering the relevant circumstances of the defendant's real conduct, whether those circumstances were specifically charged or not.  See United States v. Jackson, 3 F.3d 506, 509 (1st Cir.1993);  Wright, 873 F.2d at 441;  see generally Stephen Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key Compromises Upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L.Rev. 1, 8-12 (1988).  As now-Justice Breyer noted, the Guidelines evince a compromise between a pure \"charge offense\" system in which sentences are determined based solely upon conduct of which a defendant is convicted, and a \"real offense\" system, in which sentences are fashioned in view of all relevant mitigating and aggravating factors surrounding the defendant's conduct.  See id.   A sentencing court may, therefore, consider relevant conduct of the defendant for purposes of making Guidelines determinations, even if he has not been charged with--and indeed, even if he has been acquitted of--that conduct, so long as the conduct can be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.  See United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 80 (1st Cir.1993) (reasoning that failure of proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not preclude proof by a preponderance of the evidence), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1644, 128 L.Ed.2d 365 (1994);  Jackson, 3 F.3d at 509;  Mocciola, 891 F.2d at 17.   Resolution of this case does not require the questioning of any of these general rules but does involve recognition that there may be limits to their application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the Supreme Court and this court have recognized that the Due Process Clause itself imposes limits on the application of these doctrines in extreme cases, and we must interpret the Guidelines in light of those constraints.  This court recognized in United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942 (1st Cir.1993), that there is a range of discretion left to the district courts even within the Linnaean categorizations of the Guidelines.  We hold, under Rivera, that the district court did have discretion here, which it thought it had not, to consider a downward departure from the life sentence.  Accordingly, we remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Tail That Wags the Dog</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court decisions on sentencing, while generally endorsing rules that permit sentence enhancements to be based on conduct not proved to the same degree required to support a conviction, have not embraced the concept that those rules are free from constitutional constraints.  On the contrary, the Court has cautioned against permitting a sentence enhancement to be the \"tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.\"  McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 2417.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McMillan involved a challenge to a Pennsylvania statute that imposed a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years for a defendant found at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence to have \"visibly possessed a firearm\" in connection with his offense of conviction.  The Court held that the statute did not violate the Due Process Clause.  See McMillan, 477 U.S. at 92, 106 S.Ct. at 2419.  (\"[W]e have consistently approved sentencing schemes that mandate consideration of facts related to the crime, ... without suggesting that those facts must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  (citation omitted)).  The Court did, however, take pains to place limits upon its holding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>[The challenged statute] operates solely to limit the sentencing court's discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it without the special finding of visible possession of a firearm.  [The statute] \"ups the ante\" for the defendant only by raising to five years the minimum sentence which may be imposed within the statutory plan.  The statute gives no impression of having been tailored to permit the visible possession finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 2417 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in contrast, the tail has wagged the dog.  The consideration of the murders at Lombard's sentencing upstaged his conviction for firearms possession.  The circumstances of this case that have combined to produce this effect raise grave constitutional concerns, although each doctrine considered separately might not provoke a second thought.  Cf. United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that circumstances that individually might not warrant appellate relief \"may in the aggregate have a more debilitating effect\" and that a cumulation of circumstances \"may sometimes have a logarithmic effect, producing a total impact greater than the arithmetic sum of its constituent parts\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect here has been to permit the harshest penalty outside of capital punishment to be imposed not for conduct charged and convicted but for other conduct as to which there was, at sentencing, at best a shadow of the usual procedural protections, such as the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  This other conduct--murder--was surely of the most serious sort, but exactly the sort as to which our jurisprudence normally requires the government to meet its full burden of proof.  When put to that proof in state court, the government failed.  The punishment imposed in view of this other conduct far outstripped in degree and kind the punishment Lombard would otherwise have received for the offense of conviction.  There was no safety valve, or so thought the trial judge, to adjust the Guidelines sentence of life imprisonment to assure consideration of the penalty imposed in light of the process followed.  And that, in turn, raises questions as to whether Lombard received, as to his sentence, the process that the Constitution says was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we discuss individual concerns, we stress that it is the interplay amongst these concerns which is of import, and none of these concerns should be examined in isolation.  We start with the paramount seriousness of the ostensibly \"enhancing\" conduct at issue.  A charge of murder represents the very archetype of conduct that \"has historically been treated in the Anglo-American legal tradition as requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  McMillan, 477 U.S. at 90, 106 S.Ct. at 2418 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Thus, a rule structure that bars conviction of a firearms charge except on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but then permits imposition of a life sentence upon proof of a murder by a preponderance of the evidence attaches, in effect, the lesser procedural protections to the issue that would naturally be viewed as having the greater significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That anomaly is heightened by the specific manner in which the Guidelines operated here.  Unlike certain \"relevant conduct\" guidelines that simply call for a determinate increase in a defendant's BOL based on specified factual findings, see, e.g., U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) (calling for two-level increase in BOL for drug conviction upon a finding that a firearm was possessed), the cross-reference provision that was applied in this case, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c), required the district court to calculate Lombard's BOL as if his offense of conviction had been murder.  See U.S.S.G. Secs. 2K2.1(c), 2X1.1 (Nov. 1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Particularly in light of the absence of any stated statutory maximum for the firearms offense, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e), the cross-reference to the first-degree murder guideline essentially displaced the lower Guidelines range that otherwise would have applied.  As a result, the sentence to be imposed for Lombard's firearms conviction was the same as the sentence that would have been imposed for a federal murder conviction:  a mandatory term of life.  Despite the nominal characterization of the murders as conduct that was considered in \"enhancing\" or \"adjusting\" Lombard's firearms conviction, the reality is that the murders were treated as the gravamen of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the enhancing conduct in this case was serious, so too was the \"enhancement.\"   Attribution of the murders to Lombard operated not merely to ratchet up his prison term by some fractional increment, but rather wholly to remove the defendant's sentence from the term-of-years continuum and transform it into a life sentence without the prospect of parole.  That punishment represents \"the second most severe penalty known to the law,\" Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 996, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 2702, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (Scalia, J.).  It qualitatively differs from any lesser sentence in resting upon a determination that the \"criminal conduct is so atrocious that society's interest in deterrence and retribution wholly outweighs any considerations of reform or rehabilitation of the perpetrator.\"  Id. at 1027, 111 S.Ct. at 2719 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citation and quotation marks omitted);  see also Helm v. Solem, 684 F.2d 582, 585 (8th Cir.1982) (\"A life sentence without parole differs qualitatively from a sentence for a term of years\" because it represents the \"total[ ] reject[ion] of rehabilitation as a basic goal of our criminal justice system.\"), aff'd, 463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983).  In short, the enhancement at issue not only increased the duration of Lombard's sentence, but placed his punishment on an entirely different order of severity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This qualitative difference between the life sentence imposed and the term of years that Lombard might otherwise have received as a prior offender (262-327 months) implicates basic concerns of proportionality both between the enhancement and base sentence and between the offense and punishment as a whole.  Even if these concerns, considered alone, might not rise fully to the level of constitutional significance, they further distinguish this case from less troubling ones.  The comparative severity of the enhancement invites scrutiny of the weight given to factfinding as to ostensibly \"enhancing\" conduct (the murders) allocated to the sentencing phase, with its looser procedural constraints and lesser burden of proof.  It raises the danger of the defendant's trial and conviction being turned into a means of achieving an end that could not be achieved directly:  the imposition of a life sentence \"enhancement\" based on a federally unprosecutable murder.  In its interaction with the other concerns we describe, there is also an issue as to the proportion between the gravity of Lombard's offense of conviction and the severity of his punishment.  If a life sentence without parole is appropriate for murder, in most instances that sentence might appear to be harsh punishment for the unlawful possession of a rifle, even by a career criminal.  While one may doubt whether there are Eighth Amendment concerns<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> lurking here, cf. Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 997-1001, 111 S.Ct. at 2702-05 (Opinion of Kennedy, J.), the harshness of the life sentence in relation to the offense of conviction highlights the need for rigorous inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without impugning the principle that acquitted conduct may be considered in determining a defendant's sentence, the prior state court acquittal presents another concern in its interaction here.  Lombard put the Maine government to its proof on the charges of murder against him, and a state court jury determined that reasonable doubt as to his guilt persisted.  The federal prosecution followed on the heels of the acquittal.  As the particular murders at issue were outside the sphere of the federal prosecutor's criminal charging power as to murder,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Lombard was not charged with murder in the federal indictment;  the murders themselves were not alleged by the government to be an object of the defendants' conspiracy;  and the federal jury was required to make no factual determination regarding the commission of the murders.  Yet it would ignore reality not to recognize that the federal prosecution arose out of and was driven by the murders, and that the prosecution was well aware that the Sentencing Guidelines would require consideration of the murders at sentencing.  This reality was reflected in the prosecution's statement at the pre-sentencing conference that \"it was quite clear from the beginning;  Mr. Lombard was looking at a life sentence.\"   The government, by its own words, had intended \"from the beginning\" that consideration of the murders would result in a life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through the post-trial adjudication of the murders under a lesser standard of proof, the federal prosecution obtained precisely the result that the Maine state prosecutors attempted, but failed, to obtain.  The federal prosecution may well have done better.  The net effect of the Guidelines attribution of the murders to Lombard as understood by the district court was to mandate imposition of a life sentence.  This was the maximum that Lombard could have received had he been convicted of murder in the Maine state court.  See Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 17-A, Sec. 1251 (setting minimum sentence of 25 years and maximum of life).  Indeed, a state murder conviction might have yielded something less severe than a life sentence.  See State v. St. Pierre, 584 A.2d 618, 621-22 (Me.1990) (vacating life sentence and reducing sentence to term of 45 years, where although defendant \"committed a brutal murder,\" the record failed to \"establish behavior at the outermost portion of the range of cruelty that would constitute the aggravating circumstances of extreme cruelty\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  In any event, in no circumstances under Maine law would Lombard have been subject to a mandatory life sentence.  See State v. Shortsleeves, 580 A.2d 145, 149-50 (Me.1990);  St. Pierre, 584 A.2d at 621.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Lombard's firearms offense was the vehicle by which he was brought into the federal criminal justice system, the life sentence resulted from the district court's finding that the defendant had committed murder.  Characterized in other terms, through the mechanisms of the Guidelines and accompanying legal doctrines, the sentencing phase of the defendant's trial produced the conclusion he had committed murder and mandated imposition of a life sentence, but without the protections which normally attend the criminal process, such as the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Given the magnitude of the sentence \"enhancement,\" the seriousness of the \"enhancing\" conduct in relation to the offense of conviction, and the seemingly mandatory imposition of the life sentence, this summary process effectively overshadowed the firearms possession charge and raises serious questions as to the proper allocation of the procedural protections attendant to trial versus sentencing.  See United States v. Gigante, 39 F.3d 42, 47 (2d Cir.1994) (\"[W]e agree that there is a constitutional requirement of some rough proportionality between the weight of the evidence of the uncharged conduct and the degree of [the sentencing] adjustment....\").  We would be hard put to think of a better example of a case in which a sentence \"enhancement\" might be described as a \"tail which wags the dog\" of the defendant's offense of conviction.  McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 2417.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convergence of circumstances and processes that yielded Lombard's life sentence distinguishes this case from United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1989), and its progeny.  Mocciola itself involved the attribution to the defendant of an acquitted firearms offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and rejected the contention that consideration of the acquitted conduct (under a preponderance of the evidence standard) was unconstitutional.  Id. (quoting McMillan, 477 U.S. at 91, 106 S.Ct. at 2418, and Wright, 873 F.2d at 441).   The acquitted conduct considered in Mocciola, a firearms offense, was well within the sphere of ordinary federal prosecution.  The consideration of the acquitted conduct in Mocciola had a relatively limited effect, simply increasing the sentence by two offense levels (15 months).  See id. at 15, 17.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1644, 128 L.Ed.2d 365 (1994), defendant Patriarca's appeal raised the question whether \"relevant conduct\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3 could include two murders of which Patriarca himself had not been charged, but which had been committed in furtherance of the conspiracy to which he had pleaded guilty.  This court answered in the affirmative, reversing the district judge's conclusion.  See id. at 80-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrozza supports the analysis here in several important respects.  Although defendant Patriarca himself had not been charged federally with murder, at least one of his confederates had pleaded guilty to such a charge in a related case.  See United States v. Patriarca, 807 F.Supp. 165, 185 (D.Mass.1992), vacated, Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70.   Certainly, there had been no acquittal.  Even more importantly, Carrozza 's holding was based on the explicit assumption that consideration of the murders would not necessarily result in a life sentence.  In fact, the district court had refused to consider the uncharged murders in sentencing Patriarca, troubled by the prospect of exposing the defendant to a life sentence on the basis of uncharged conduct.  This court rejected the premise of the district court's concern, explaining that Patriarca's offenses of conviction--RICO violations--carried statutory maximum sentences of twenty years each.  See Carrozza, 4 F.3d at 81.   But even so, the panel was careful to reserve decision as to whether there might remain a basis for concern if the district court were to order Patriarca to serve consecutive twenty-year sentences on each of his three RICO convictions, the practical equivalent of a life sentence.  The court openly acknowledged that it was troubled by this potentiality:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>At least one member of the panel believes that serious constitutional concerns may arise if the defendant ultimately receives the equivalent of a life sentence on the ground of his connection with a murder for which he was never indicted, tried or convicted by a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See id. at 81 n. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation hypothesized in Carrozza is closer to the one we face here, with added amplifying elements.  Lombard was acquitted of the murders by a state court jury.  Nonetheless he received not just \"the equivalent of a life sentence\" based on attribution of the murders, but a true life sentence, and a mandatory one at that.  Further, the sentence imposed may have been even more severe than what he would have received had he been convicted in state court.  We believe, as did \"at least one member of the panel\" in Carrozza, that the life sentence imposed upon the defendant raises \"serious constitutional concerns.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These concerns are reinforced by the Supreme Court's recent discussion in Witte v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995).  The Court framed its analysis by asking when a sentence enhancement can properly be viewed as punishment for the offense of conviction, as opposed to punishment for the enhancing conduct.  While the case involved a Double Jeopardy and not a Due Process challenge, its discussion is instructive here:  if the life sentence that Lombard received can realistically be viewed as punishment for the murders, as opposed to punishment for the firearms offense, the constitutional difficulties alluded to in McMillan then come to the fore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Witte, the defendant had been convicted on a marijuana charge, then received an enhanced prison term in view of certain cocaine-related \"relevant conduct\" considered at sentencing.  Later, the defendant was prosecuted for that same cocaine-related conduct.  He objected on double jeopardy grounds, arguing that he had already been punished for the cocaine-related conduct by virtue of the sentence enhancement following the marijuana conviction.  The Supreme Court disagreed and held that the defendant had been punished in the first prosecution only for the offense of conviction (the marijuana charge), even though the sentencing court had considered the cocaine-related conduct in calculating his sentence.  See id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2207.   In so concluding, however, the Court emphasized that the sentence for the defendant's offense of conviction (the marijuana charge) had carried a statutory maximum, and the \"enhancement\" to the defendant's sentence had merely fixed the term of imprisonment at some point closer to (but still below) that maximum:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>The relevant conduct provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines ... are sentencing enhancement regimes evincing the judgment that a particular offense should receive a more serious sentence within the authorized range if it was either accompanied by or preceded by additional criminal activity.  Petitioner does not argue that the range fixed by Congress is so broad, and the enhancing role played by the relevant conduct so significant, that consideration of that conduct in sentencing has become \"a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.\"  McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88 [106 S.Ct. at 2417]....  We hold that, where the legislature has authorized such a particular punishment range for a given crime, the resulting sentence within that range constitutes punishment only for the offense of conviction for purposes of the double jeopardy inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Witte, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2208 (emphases added, some citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents precisely the troubling situation that Witte makes an effort to distinguish:  the applicable statutory sentencing range (fifteen years minimum, no stated maximum) is quite broad, and the enhancing role played by the relevant conduct--the murders--is inordinately significant.  The effect of considering the murders was not just to fix Lombard's sentence at some higher point within a particular range delimited by Congress for the firearms offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Instead, the Guidelines, combined with the absence of a stated statutory maximum, essentially required the district court to determine Lombard's base offense level as if his offense of conviction had been first-degree murder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c).  This comes perilously close, we believe, to punishing Lombard for the ostensibly \"enhancing\" conduct, the murders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the aftermath of Witte, this court in United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993 (1st Cir.1995), recently noted that the manner in which a sentence is enhanced over and above the sentence that a defendant would otherwise receive is subject to constitutional limits:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>[T]he burgeoning use of sentence enhancers by Congress and the Sentencing Commission as part of the catechism of punishment poses an obvious danger that, in extreme circumstances, the lagniappe might begin to overwhelm the main course.  In all probability, there are constitutional limits on the way sentencing factors can be deployed in the punishment of a substantive offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is substantial reason for concern that the \"enhancement\" that produced Lombard's life sentence exceeded these limits.  The convergence that produced Lombard's life sentence, we believe, is exactly the reason for the Supreme Court's reserve in McMillan and in Witte when it carefully withheld its constitutional blessing for a sentence \"enhancement\" that would be a \"tail which wags the dog\" of a defendant's offense of conviction.  That troubling hypothetical is the reality here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Considering Departure:  Outside the \"Heartland\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we look first to whether the Guidelines themselves are indeed so inflexible as the government urged at sentencing, or whether they permit a different result, and if so, whether that result would avoid the constitutional issue.  See United States v. Monsanto, 491 U.S. 600, 611, 109 S.Ct. 2657, 2663, 105 L.Ed.2d 512 (1989);  Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. &amp; Constr.  Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392, 1397, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988).  We hold that a sentence of life imprisonment was not an inexorable outcome under the Guidelines, that this case is within the scope of section 5K2.0 which provides flexibility, and that, under our decision in Rivera, the district court had authority to avoid any unfairness in Lombard's sentence through the mechanism of downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principles governing downward departures under the Sentencing Guidelines were comprehensively outlined by this court in United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942 (1st Cir.1993), and we apply its teachings here.  A fundamental premise of the Sentencing Guidelines is that \"each guideline ... carv[es] out a 'heartland,' a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes.\"   U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro. comment.  (4)(b);  see Rivera, 994 F.2d at 947.   As the Sentencing Commission itself recognized, however, some cases will involve circumstances that make them atypical and remove them from the \"heartland\" of a guideline's literal scope.  U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro. comment.  (4)(b).  A case that falls outside of a guideline's heartland \"is, by definition, an 'unusual case' \" and therefore a candidate for downward or upward departure.  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 947.   The basic question, then, is simply:  \"Does this case fall within the 'heartland,' or is it an unusual case?\"  Id. at 948.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission has been explicit that, with several notable exceptions not applicable here, it \"d[id] not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.\"   U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro. comment.  (4)(b).  The Guidelines themselves recognize that even if a case presents no circumstances specifically identified as permissible grounds for departure, the case may still be sufficiently unusual to warrant it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>Circumstances that may warrant departure from the guidelines pursuant to this provision cannot, by their very nature, be comprehensively listed and analyzed in advance.  The controlling decision as to whether and to what extent departure is warranted can only be made by the courts....  Any case may involve factors in addition to those identified that have not been given adequate consideration by the Commission.  Presence of any such factor may warrant departure from the guidelines, under some circumstances, in the discretion of the sentencing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.  The commentary to section 5K2.0 further provides that even where various single circumstances, considered individually, might be insufficient to permit a finding that a case is outside the heartland of a particular guideline, the presence of those circumstances in combination might permit a different assessment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>The Commission does not foreclose the possibility of an extraordinary case that, because of a combination of ... characteristics or circumstances [that separately would not warrant departure], differs significantly from the \"heartland\" cases covered by the guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory purposes of sentencing, even though none of the characteristics or circumstances individually distinguishes the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0, comment.  (Nov. 1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  The Guidelines, in short, do not always mandate the appropriate sentence.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 949 (\"Ultimately, ... the Guidelines cannot dictate how courts should sentence in such special, unusual or other-than-ordinary circumstances.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court is entitled to considerable \"leeway\" in its determination of whether a given set of circumstances renders a particular case \"unusual,\" id. at 951, this court has plenary review over legal questions involving interpretation of the Guidelines and over the district court's determination of whether it had authority to depart based on its assessment of the relevant sentencing facts.  See id. at 951.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court did not consider whether departure would have been appropriate under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.  At Lombard's sentencing hearing, the district court expressed considerable unease at the sentence of mandatory life imprisonment that had resulted from its consideration, as required by the Guidelines, of Lombard's acquitted conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  The government asserted at the sentencing hearing that the Guidelines \"leave this court in essence no discretion whatsoever to sentence [Lombard] below life imprisonment [emphasis added].\"  The district court thought that it lacked authority to impose any sentence other than life imprisonment.  The court also did not consider whether the constitutional questions raised by the mandatory life sentence might warrant a finding that this case falls outside the heartland of the applicable guideline.  Thus, we conclude, as did the court in Rivera, that the district court erroneously believed it had no power to deviate from the sentence indicated by a straightforward application of the Guidelines and \"did not realize that it had the legal power to consider [downward] departure\" in the special circumstances presented.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 953.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts and circumstances of this case present a whole greater than the sum of its parts and distinguish it, from a constitutional perspective, from other cases that have involved facially similar issues.  The specific question from the perspective of the Guidelines and under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0 is whether these features of the case--e.g., the state court acquittal and the fact that the federal sentence may exceed any state sentence that would have attached to a murder conviction;  the paramount seriousness of the \"enhancing conduct\";  the magnitude of the \"enhancement\";  the disproportionality between the sentence and the offense of conviction as well as between the enhancement and the base sentence;  and the absence of a statutory maximum for the offense of conviction--taken in combination, make this case \"unusual\" and remove it from the \"heartland\" of the guideline (Sec. 2K2.1) that yielded the mandatory life sentence.  This case is outside the \"heartland.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission in writing U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c) was undoubtedly aware that the cross-reference provision might in some cases call for a defendant's base offense level to be determined by reference to the guideline governing murder.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c)(1)(B) (Nov. 1995).  But from our \"intermediate vantage point\" in the sentencing process, we try to place particular cases within \"a broader perspective of sentencing law,\" Rivera, 994 F.2d at 949.   It seems to us unlikely that the Commission could have envisioned the particular combination of circumstances that in this case culminated in the mandatory life sentence and the corresponding institutional concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not constitutional concerns were raised by these circumstances, as we think they are, we conclude that their combination here gave the court power to depart under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.  That the application of the Guidelines that produced the mandatory life sentence does raise constitutional concerns only reinforces our conclusion.  This case may be viewed--virtually by definition--as an \"unusual\" one falling outside the heartland of section 2K2.1(c).  To decide otherwise would be to assume that the Commission intended that the application of section 2K2.1(c)'s cross-reference provisions could, even in a heartland case, produce sentences raising serious constitutional issues.  This we cannot do.  Cf. Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 137-38, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 2186-87, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (declining to credit an interpretation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 that would effectively impute to Congress an intent to produce a potentially unconstitutional result).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the major goals of the sentencing reforms enacted by Congress was to \"assure that sentences are fair both to the offender and to society.\"   S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 39 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3222, quoted in United States v. LaBonte, 70 F.3d 1396, 1408 (1st Cir.1995).  That sense of fairness is better served here by giving effect to the discretion preserved to the courts by the Commission in U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.  If a goal of the Guidelines is to \"avoid[ ] unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct,\" 28 U.S.C. Sec. 991(b)(1)(B), it is difficult to see how mandating imposition of a life sentence on the facts here serves that goal.  It is the conduct for which there has been no conviction which raises the sentence here to a life term, and then only by means of a finding by a mere preponderance of the evidence.  Yet a life term is the same sentence that would have been imposed for a conviction of murder.  Giving unbridled effect here to the cross-referenced murder guideline would, instead of furthering the goal of treating like cases alike, ignore the very real differences inherent in our system of criminal justice between a conviction for murder based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a firearms conviction enhanced by a finding that guns were used to commit the same murder based on a preponderance of the evidence.  Cf. Gigante, 39 F.3d at 47-48 (characterizing preponderance standard as a mere \"tie-breaker\" for evenly balanced evidence).  Viewing this case as falling outside the heartland of section 2K2.1(c) seems more consistent with the sentencing goals set by Congress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  See LaBonte, 70 F.3d at 1408.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines were not meant to have foreclosed the district court from considering a section 5K2.0 downward departure here.  Cf. United States v. Cuevas-Gomez, 61 F.3d 749, 750 (9th Cir.1995) (noting that automatic 16-level sentence enhancement for certain defendants under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(b)(2) averts due process problems \"precisely because\" the district court has discretion to consider departure based on the individual facts of the case).  Certainly, a downward departure here would not be forbidden.  See id.;  Concepcion, 983 F.2d at 389.   Had such a downward departure been considered, the impact of giving sentencing weight to the acquitted murders could have been tempered by the district court's fact-based, discretionary judgment.  That judgment would have been informed by the background principle that a sentence enhancement may not function as a \"tail which wags the dog\" of the defendant's offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approach adopted here is similar to that adopted by the Second Circuit, which has used the mechanism of downward departure to resolve a situation similar to this one.  In United States v. Concepcion, one of three codefendants (Frias) was convicted on a firearms charge but acquitted of a drug conspiracy charge.  On the firearms charges alone, the defendant's guidelines sentencing range would have been 12-18 months.  Applying the cross-reference in U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1 (the same provision at issue here), the district court had found that the defendant actually had engaged in the acquitted conduct, and thus determined his base offense level with reference to that conduct.  The result was a 24-level upward adjustment, with a final Guidelines sentencing range of 210-262 months.  983 F.2d at 389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit, reviewing settled circuit precedent, held that the district court had properly applied the Guidelines, and that the defendants' constitutional rights had not been violated by the consideration of the acquitted conspiracy charge.  Yet the court expressed serious discomfort with the magnitude of the sentence enhancement that had resulted.  It observed:  \"we doubt that, with respect to conduct of which the defendant was acquitted, the [Sentencing] Commission intended so extreme an increase.\"  Id.;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  see also United States v. Monk, 15 F.3d 25, 26, 28-29 (2d Cir.1994).  The court concluded that in the circumstances of that case, a downward departure under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0 might well have been warranted.  Because \"the [district] court apparently [had] not consider[ed] whether such a departure was permissible,\" the Second Circuit vacated the sentence and remanded for further proceedings.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the facts here, we are not as confident, as was the Second Circuit in Concepcion, that the sentence enhancement at issue passes constitutional muster.  We do share the doubts of the Second Circuit that the Sentencing Commission could have foreseen the kinds of circumstances which in this case have coalesced to produce a mandatory life sentence, and we agree that in these circumstances, a downward departure under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0 was within the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents difficult and delicate issues, not now susceptible of articulation through general rules.  Our concerns have arisen from a situation where acquitted conduct calling for a challenged sentence increase is itself very serious conduct, substantively more serious than the offense with which defendant was charged, where consideration of that conduct resulted in an enormous increase<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> in the sentence (including possibly beyond the sentence that would have been imposed for a conviction), where the ultimate sentence is itself enormous, and where the judge is seemingly mandated to impose that sentence.  Such a situation increases the risk that what the judge is required to and in fact is sentencing the defendant for is not the convicted offense as enhanced by relevant conduct, but directly for conduct as to which the defendant has not been charged, tried by a jury, nor convicted on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d at 1001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concerns which the district court expressed here are valid, and we have tried to state the reasons for those concerns, and forcefully so.  But we also stress that this is an extreme case.  Absent the special circumstances we have highlighted here, no comparable concerns would be raised by cases involving even sizeable sentence increases based on an uncharged quantity of drugs, see United States v. Castellone, 985 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1993), an uncharged or acquitted firearms offense, see United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.1994), the defendant's commission of an unchargeable state offense, see United States v. Carroll, 3 F.3d 98 (4th Cir.1993), or any number of kindred sentence enhancements.  The outcome we adopt here should not be understood as an invitation to litigate constitutional or departure issues in usual cases involving sentence enhancements based on uncharged or acquitted conduct.  This is an unusual and perhaps a singular case, at the boundaries of constitutional sentencing law, and does not provide an open door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court did not recognize its authority to consider whether a downward departure would have been appropriate, we vacate Lombard's life sentence and remand for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 953 (remanding for resentencing where district court erroneously thought it had no power to depart from the Guidelines sentencing range);  cf. United States v. Garafano, 61 F.3d 113, 116 (1st Cir.1995) (appellate courts have broad power to \"adapt mandates to the particular problem discerned on appeal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard's claim that the district court erroneously refused to award him sentencing credit for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a) is without merit.  Lombard has not met his burden of clearly demonstrating acceptance of responsibility for his offense.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a).  Review of the adequacy of the defendant's proof is only for clear error.  See United States v.

These statements were made to defend against state charges and cannot plausibly be taken as warranting a sentence reduction under section 3E1.1(a).  The making of an incriminating statement cannot, without more, establish acceptance of responsibility.  Cf. United States v. Wrenn, 66 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1995) (divulging incriminating information to government informant did not establish eligibility for sentencing leniency under 18 U.S.C.

Sec. 3E1.1, comment.  (n. 2).

Hartley had also testified that Lombard told him on the morning of the murders that Hartley \"didn't have to take no shit from nobody\";  that Lombard and Hartley on that Thanksgiving morning saw Martin and Lindsey (the victims) sleeping on couches in the living room of Hartley's cabin;  and that Lombard had, after the murders, threatened to kill Hartley and Theriault if they did not \"stick\" to their plan to tell police, if questioned, that they had last seen the two victims on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartley's prior testimony from Lombard's state trial was admitted under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule, see Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>The following [is] not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>(1) Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, ... if the party against whom the testimony is now offered ... had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other conditions clearly being met, the only question is whether Lombard had \"similar motive\" at his state trial to \"develop\" Hartley's testimony through cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The party against whom the prior testimony is offered must have had a similar, not necessarily an identical, motive to develop the adverse testimony in the prior proceeding.  See United States v. Salerno, 505 U.S. 317, 326, 112 S.Ct. 2503, 2509, 120 L.Ed.2d 255 (1992) (Blackmun, J., concurring).  Because Lombard faced both liability as to murder and as to being an accomplice to murder under Maine law, he had a very forceful interest at his state trial in attacking Hartley's testimony, in order to discredit his account of the actual killings, the concealing of evidence and the attempt to escape prosecution.  This interest could hardly have been any stronger at the federal trial, see United States v. DiNapoli, 8 F.3d 909, 914-15 (2d Cir.1993) (en banc), and the testimony, to the extent it related to the events preceding and following the murders, was properly admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartley's prior testimony from Lombard's trial concerning the .22 caliber rifle presents a different set of issues.  In contrast to the federal trial, Lombard had little real incentive at his state trial to attack Hartley's statements concerning possession or ownership of the rifle.  But Lombard himself admitted during the course of his own direct examination at his state trial that the .22 caliber rifle belonged to him.  Furthermore, other properly admitted evidence, including Tammy Theriault's testimony that Lombard owned the rifle, strongly corroborated Lombard's admission.  Thus, under the circumstances presented here, we believe any error arising from the admission of this portion of Hartley's prior testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admission of Hartley's former testimony from Lombard's state trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.  See U.S. Const. amend.  VI (\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\").  The Clause restricts but does not proscribe the admission of a declarant's prior testimony against a criminal defendant, requiring only that the declarant be \"unavailable\" and that the prior testimony sought to be admitted \"bear[ ] adequate 'indicia of reliability,' \" e.g., by \"fall[ing] within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\"   See Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2538-39, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution established that Hartley was indeed \"unavailable,\" and his former testimony at Lombard's state trial was within the firmly-rooted exception to the hearsay rule carved out for prior trial testimony that has been subjected to cross-examination.  See Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895) (holding that prior trial testimony is admissible upon retrial if declarant becomes unavailable);  see also Roberts, 448 U.S. at 67-73, 100 S.Ct. at 2540-42.   That testimony bears \"sufficient 'indicia of reliability' \" that there was no Confrontation Clause violation.  See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 73, 100 S.Ct. at 2542.  (citation omitted);  Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 722, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 1320, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968) (dicta) (\"where a witness is unavailable and has given testimony at previous judicial proceedings against the same defendant which was subject to cross-examination by that defendant,\" his confrontation rights are satisfied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

He posed only a general objection by a motion in limine, but made no comparable objection at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  That was not enough.  See United States v.

Theriault's testimony, as well as that of her mother, independently established Hartley's knowledge of Lombard's status as a convicted felon, and Lombard himself stipulated to having committed prior felonies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Admission of the challenged evidence was not plain error, and there is no basis for reversal.

Admission of Testimony About the Murders</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The admission of a substantial amount of evidence concerning the murders, Lombard argues, was error under Fed.R.Evid. 403, because the prejudicial impact of that evidence outweighed its probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard preserved his Rule 403 objection only with respect to the Theriault testimony.  He has not met his burden of showing an abuse of discretion in the admission of that testimony.  See Abreu, 952 F.2d at 1467.   A decision by the district court on a Rule 403 determination must stand absent a demonstration of \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances.\"  United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1339 (1st Cir.1994);  see also United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1989).  There are no such circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Lombard posed no Rule 403 objection to the admission of Hartley's and even his own former testimony about the murders undercuts his objection to Theriault's testimony.  Her testimony about Hartley's and Lombard's conduct in connection with the murders was at least equally relevant.  One of the objectives of the defendants' conspiracy charged was to \"flee the State of Maine in order to avoid prosecution or the giving of testimony in connection with the homicides of Morris Martin and Paul Lindsey, Jr.\"   The indictment also charged that the defendants conspired to \"dispose of certain evidence of Henry P. Lombard's unlawful possession\" of a firearm.  Proof of these charges required proof of the events surrounding the murders, the defendants' knowledge of the murders, and the defendants' joint conduct following the murders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court recognized that it was neither possible nor appropriate to excise all evidence of the murders from the government's proof of the defendants' conspiracy.  It correctly observed that the evidence touching on the murders had some prejudicial effect, but explicitly weighed that effect against its probative value, and decided in favor of admitting much, but not all, of the testimony offered.  There are no \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances\" that would warrant disturbing the district court's balancing of prejudice against probative value here.

That offense level would have translated into a Guidelines sentencing range of 262-327 months</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The same result would obtain under the current version of the Guidelines.  The November 1991 amendment to section 2K2.1(c) created a specific provision for cases in which the underlying offense conduct is found to have resulted in death.  See U.S.S.G. App.  C, amend. 374.  The cross-reference, as amended, provides as follows:</p>\n        <p>(1) If the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense, ... apply</p>\n        <p>(B) if death resulted, the most analogous offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 1 (Homicide), if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>\n        <p>U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c)(1)(B) (Nov. 1995).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The current version of the cross-reference is even more explicit, directing the court to apply, in cases where death resulted from the defendant's offense conduct, \"the most analogous offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 1 (Homicide).\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c)(1)(B) (Nov. 1995)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Interestingly, the Constitution of the State of Maine contains an explicit proportionality guarantee:  \"[A]ll penalties and punishments shall be proportional to the offence.\"   Me. Const. art.  I, Sec. 9.  Thus, it is a fair question whether the Maine Constitution would have permitted the resulting sentence here if Maine had done what the federal prosecution did</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> It bears emphasis that the perceived severity of a sentence is not, standing alone, a basis for departing from the Guidelines sentencing range.  United States v. Jackson, 30 F.3d 199, 203-04 (1st Cir.1994).  Here, the magnitude of the sentence enhancement is of concern only when viewed in its interaction with the other aspects of this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The government conceded at oral argument that Lombard and Hartley could not have been charged under any of the federal murder statutes.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1111, 2113(e), 2118(c)(2);  21 U.S.C. Sec. 848(e).  The murders did not take place on any federal installation, were not in connection with the robbery of a federally insured bank or a robbery involving federally controlled substances, nor were committed in the course of a continuing criminal enterprise as defined by federal law.  Whether or not it could do so, the fact is that Congress has chosen not to federalize the state crime of murder in cases like Lombard's, and so has not authorized reprosecution for murder pursuant to the doctrine of separate sovereignties.  See Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187, 79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (1959).  Thus, the issue raised is not one of Double Jeopardy, nor, strictly speaking, of the reach of the federal power, but one of Due Process:  whether the sentencing court is precluded from considering that the Sentencing Guidelines as applied, through the vehicle of sentence enhancement, effectively punishes the defendant for conduct as to which there exists no statutory authorization for the government even to prosecute</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> If Lombard had been convicted of murder in the Maine state court and received a sentence of a term of years, he would have been eligible to receive credit against time to be served under the \"good time\" provisions of state law, which are considerably more generous than similar federal provisions.  Compare Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 17-A, Sec. 1253(3) (entitling any person sentenced to a term of more than six months \"to receive a deduction of 10 days each month for observing all rules of the department and institution\") with 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3624(b) (permitting up to 54 days of good time credit per year to prisoners serving terms of more than one year but less than life but allowing no such credit to persons serving a sentence for a crime of violence)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The defendant had pleaded guilty on a cocaine conspiracy charge, but went to trial and was acquitted by the federal jury on a firearms possession charge arising out of the same course of conduct.  See Mocciola, 891 F.2d at 14</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> At least two post-Mocciola cases from this circuit were likewise decided on facts dissimilar to the circumstances here.  See United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 23-26 (1st Cir.1994) (upholding, after drug conviction, two-level sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) in view of conduct alleged in a dismissed firearms charge);  United States v. Jackson, 3 F.3d 506, 509-10 (1st Cir.1993) (same, in view of uncharged conduct of which co-defendant was acquitted)</p>\n        <p>Also, in United States v. LaCroix, 28 F.3d 223 (1st Cir.1994), the holding of Mocciola was restated in dictum, but the only issue was whether certain financial losses could be attributed to the defendant under the \"relevant conduct\" provision of U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1) (June 1988).  The defendant had been convicted as a participant in the conspiracy that caused those losses, but the jury had deadlocked on the substantive counts.  The jury's inability to reach consensus on the substantive counts was held not to preclude a finding that the losses were foreseeable to the defendant as a convicted co-conspirator.  See id. at 230-31.  LaCroix does not aid the resolution of this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> This is in striking contrast to the case of Lombard's co-defendant, Hartley.  After he pleaded guilty, Count 3 of the indictment was dismissed as to him on the government's motion.  Hartley's BOL of 12 as to Count 1, with a criminal history category of I, would have yielded a sentence of 10-16 months.  The district court found that Hartley, like Lombard, was subject to the cross-reference provision of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c).  But, as the government informed us at oral argument, Hartley--who did not qualify as a career criminal--had the benefit of a five-year statutory maximum on his conviction under Count 1, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, which is what he received after his plea.  (Had Count 3 not been dismissed, Hartley likely would have been subject to the ten-year statutory maximum contained in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(a)(2) for aiding and abetting the firearms offense.)   Thus, for Hartley, consideration of the murders under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c) only had the effect of increasing his sentence from a base of 10-16 months to the statutory maximum of five years, even though Tammy Theriault's testimony indicated that Hartley shared at least equal blame with Lombard for the murders</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Cases from other circuits addressing the permissibility of considering acquitted (or uncharged) conduct at sentencing generally have involved only modest sentence increases, or increases that were within a stated statutory maximum, or both, and so provide little guidance here.  See, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 19 F.3d 895, 896-97 (4th Cir.1994) (affirming 2-level sentence enhancement on drug conviction based on an acquitted firearms charge);  United States v. Smith, 5 F.3d 259, 261-62 (7th Cir.1993) (affirming imposition of statutory maximum sentence of 5 years for firearms conviction based on finding at sentencing that defendant had committed second degree murder, even though defendant had been convicted only of involuntary manslaughter in state court);  United States v.

Patterson, 386 U.S. 605, 607, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 1210-11, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967).  In Specht, the Court held that where the defendant had been convicted under a sex offender statute carrying a 10-year maximum penalty, the state could not constitutionally sentence him without a hearing (with appropriate protections such as the right to counsel and to cross-examine witnesses) under a separate but related statute that permitted imposition of a sentence of 1 day to life based on proof that the defendant posed a threat of bodily harm to the public.

Thus, after [defendant] was tried for the conspiracy offense and acquitted, he faces virtually the same sentence that he would have received had he been convicted! ...

Also, since Lombard was neither present nor represented at Hartley's state trial and had no opportunity to cross-examine him there, the testimony was not admissible under Rule 804(b)(1)</p>\n        <p>Admission of the sidebar statement by Hartley's counsel as to what he believed his client was about to say presents difficulties as well, for other reasons.  Cf. United States v. Harris, 914 F.2d 927, 930-31 (7th Cir.1990).  Sometimes, an attorney's statements may be imputed to and admitted against his client as a principal under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).  See Harris, 914 F.2d at 931.   But cf. United States v.

It is doubtful, though, whether this rule would apply to such an offer of proof by counsel at sidebar.  In any event, even if the rule properly applied, it would only make the statements admissible against Hartley, not Lombard.  See Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D) (statement by a party's agent is only admissible against that party).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> The defendant's only contemporaneous objection to the testimony at trial was limited to specific language in the transcript of the earlier proceeding.

In any event, the Tavares en banc decision had not been handed down at the time of Lombard's trial (December 1993) and thus does not affect the determination of plain error.  Cf. United States v.

Each was acquitted.  Afterward, Lombard and Hartley were indicted as co-defendants in the federal district court in Maine on federal firearms and other charges arising out of the murders.  Hartley pleaded guilty at mid-trial, but appellant Lombard entrusted his fate to the jury.  He was convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, under the Guidelines, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Lombard had used his illegally possessed firearm to commit \"another offense\":  the same murders of which he had been acquitted in the state court.  The resulting Guidelines sentence was a mandatory term of life in prison, which Maine law would not have required even had defendant been convicted of the murders.  Lombard thus received a life sentence based on the federal court's finding that it was more likely than not that Lombard had committed the murders of which he had been acquitted.  The sentencing judge was greatly troubled but felt as a matter of law that he had no authority to do otherwise under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard appeals the mandatory life sentence and his convictions.

Finding that this is a case in which the life sentence enhancement is the \"tail which wags the dog\" of defendant's trial and conviction, thus raising constitutional due process concerns, we hold that under section 5K2.0 of the Guidelines the district court had the authority, which it thought it had not, to consider a downward departure.  We vacate the life sentence and remand for a determination of whether a downward departure might be warranted in the unique circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Thanksgiving morning of 1990, Morris Martin and Paul Lindsey, Jr. were murdered, each shot in the head as he lay sleeping in the living room of a small cabin in the backwoods of Fairfield, Maine.  The cabin was owned by Hubert Hartley, the half-brother of the defendant Henry Lombard.  All four men had been living in the cabin for a week to hunt deer in the surrounding woods.  Tammy Theriault, Hartley's girlfriend, had also been living in the cabin, along with her eighteen month old daughter.  She was also pregnant with Hartley's child at the time.  Theriault was a near-eyewitness to the murders, able to hear and observe much through a hole in the floor of her upstairs bedroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard and Hartley were tried separately on state charges of murder before two juries in the Maine Superior Court.  Each defendant testified in his own defense and claimed that the other had committed the murders.  Hartley and Theriault testified against Lombard at Lombard's trial.  Both state trials resulted in acquittals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One year later, a federal grand jury returned an indictment in the U.S. District Court, charging Hartley and Lombard with unlawful possession of a firearm, aiding and abetting the same, and with conspiracy charges relating to the aftermath of the murders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Lombard and Hartley were tried jointly in the federal district court.  The prosecution's key witness was Tammy Theriault.  Her testimony departed in some respects from the testimony and statements she gave earlier.  She testified, as follows, that although she did not see the murders being committed, she did hear conversations between Hartley and Lombard just before and after the gunshots were fired.  At about 10 a.m. on Thanksgiving morning, Lombard and Hartley returned to the cabin from a morning hunt.  Martin and Lindsey were asleep on couches in the living room.  Hartley, seeing Theriault, told her to go back upstairs because he and Lombard \"had something to do.\"   On returning to her room, she heard Lombard say to Hartley, \"[I]f you don't shoot him, I'm going to shoot 'em both.\"   Next, Theriault, still upstairs with her baby daughter, heard five or six gunshots, followed by Lombard's exclamation, \"I didn't think you had the guts to do it.\"   Hartley boasted, \"I showed you, didn't I?\" and added, \"I don't think he's dead yet.  Shoot him again.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard and Hartley stuffed the victims' bodies in garbage bags, as Theriault watched through the hole in her bedroom floor.  Theriault was with Lombard and Hartley as they cleaned the cabin of blood and other evidence and hid the bodies temporarily in the cellar.  The next day, as the two men were attempting to move the bodies to the trunk of Hartley's car, Theriault's family arrived to bring Thanksgiving leftovers.  They sat visiting in the living room, with one victim's body hidden in the trunk of Hartley's car outside, the other still in the cellar.  Theriault accompanied Lombard and Hartley when they later went to dump both bodies in a roadside bog.  She was also present when Lombard sold his Marlin .22 caliber rifle as well as the victims' two hunting guns to a broker.  Lombard and Hartley were planning to flee from Maine to Massachusetts just before they were arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Excerpts of testimony that Hartley and Lombard had given in their state court murder trials were also admitted into evidence.  These excerpts (including Lombard's own prior testimony) corroborated much of Theriault's account and established that Lombard owned a Marlin .22 caliber rifle which he had brought to Hartley's cabin, that he loaded it on the morning of Thanksgiving Day, 1990, that he took the gun with him to go hunting that morning, and that Lombard and Hartley together attempted to clean the bloody cabin following the murders, removed evidence of the murders, disposed of the bodies, and planned to flee from Maine.  Other witnesses' testimony established that Lombard had reason to be aware that he could not lawfully possess a firearm, that he nonetheless purchased the .22 caliber rifle from Tammy Theriault's brother, and that the bullets that were recovered from the victims' bodies were consistent with having been fired from a .22 caliber rifle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartley pleaded guilty at the close of the government's case.

The court determined that the firearm had so been used.

Calculation of the Guidelines Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard received a life sentence as a thrice-prior convicted felon ostensibly for his unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 922(g) and 924(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He was sentenced to the statutory maximum of 60 months for the conviction on the conspiracy count, concurrent with the life sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Lombard does not contend here that the district court incorrectly applied the Guidelines in determining his life sentence, but rather argues that the manner in which the Guidelines, as applied by the court, required it to conduct its factfinding and mandated the life sentence violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific guideline applicable to the defendant's firearms conviction is U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Subsection (a)(2) of the 1990 version of section 2K2.1 sets a BOL of 12 \"if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The \"cross-reference\" provision of subsection (c)(2) of section 2K2.1 directs that \"[i]f the defendant used or possessed the firearm in connection with commission or attempted commission of another offense, apply Sec. 2X1.1 ... in respect to that other offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c)(2) (Nov. 1990).  Treating the murders as \"another offense,\" and finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had committed that other offense, the court applied section 2X1.1, which directed the defendant's BOL to be set at \"[t]he base offense level from the guideline for the object offense....\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2X1.1(a) (Nov. 1990).  The \"object offense\" was first degree murder, to which a BOL of 43 attaches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2A1.1.  Finding no basis for awarding acceptance-of-responsibility credit, the district court assigned a total offense level of 43.  Because Lombard was sentenced as a career criminal under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e), there was a statutory minimum of 15 years, but no stated statutory maximum applicable;  thus no reduction was indicated under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.1(a) (which requires adjustment of a Guidelines sentence to comply with the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction).  The defendant's final Guidelines sentence was a mandatory term of life imprisonment.  See U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (assigning life sentence to BOL of 43 for all criminal history categories).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Life Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mandatory imposition of a life sentence here raises questions of whether such a result was strictly intended by the Sentencing Guidelines and whether the method followed to produce that result comports with the Due Process Clause.  Our focus is on the process by which the result was reached.  Lombard makes no claim, nor could he, on the facts here that imposition of a life sentence on him (accompanied by due process) would itself be unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.

The life sentence resulted from the convergence of several doctrines in sentencing law, each individually well accepted, and none of which individually is questionable here.  But just as folk wisdom recognizes that the whole is often greater and different than simply the sum of its parts, these individual doctrines, each reflecting compromises in our criminal jurisprudence, in this extreme case threaten in combination to erode rights that the Constitution does not permit to be compromised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take as given that once convicted, a defendant has no right under the Due Process Clause to have his sentencing determination be confined to facts proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

The consideration of the murders at Lombard's sentencing upstaged his conviction for firearms possession.  The circumstances of this case that have combined to produce this effect raise grave constitutional concerns, although each doctrine considered separately might not provoke a second thought.  Cf. United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1195-96 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that circumstances that individually might not warrant appellate relief \"may in the aggregate have a more debilitating effect\" and that a cumulation of circumstances \"may sometimes have a logarithmic effect, producing a total impact greater than the arithmetic sum of its constituent parts\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This other conduct--murder--was surely of the most serious sort, but exactly the sort as to which our jurisprudence normally requires the government to meet its full burden of proof.  When put to that proof in state court, the government failed.  The punishment imposed in view of this other conduct far outstripped in degree and kind the punishment Lombard would otherwise have received for the offense of conviction.  There was no safety valve, or so thought the trial judge, to adjust the Guidelines sentence of life imprisonment to assure consideration of the penalty imposed in light of the process followed.  And that, in turn, raises questions as to whether Lombard received, as to his sentence, the process that the Constitution says was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we discuss individual concerns, we stress that it is the interplay amongst these concerns which is of import, and none of these concerns should be examined in isolation.  We start with the paramount seriousness of the ostensibly \"enhancing\" conduct at issue.  A charge of murder represents the very archetype of conduct that \"has historically been treated in the Anglo-American legal tradition as requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111713\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">McMillan,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111713/mcmillan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 2418 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Thus, a rule structure that bars conviction of a firearms charge except on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but then permits imposition of a life sentence upon proof of a murder by a preponderance of the evidence attaches, in effect, the lesser procedural protections to the issue that would naturally be viewed as having the greater significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That anomaly is heightened by the specific manner in which the Guidelines operated here.  Unlike certain \"relevant conduct\" guidelines that simply call for a determinate increase in a defendant's BOL based on specified factual findings, see, e.g., U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(b)(1) (calling for two-level increase in BOL for drug conviction upon a finding that a firearm was possessed), the cross-reference provision that was applied in this case, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c), required the district court to calculate Lombard's BOL as if his offense of conviction had been murder.  See U.S.S.G. Secs. 2K2.1(c), 2X1.1 (Nov. 1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Particularly in light of the absence of any stated statutory maximum for the firearms offense, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e), the cross-reference to the first-degree murder guideline essentially displaced the lower Guidelines range that otherwise would have applied.  As a result, the sentence to be imposed for Lombard's firearms conviction was the same as the sentence that would have been imposed for a federal murder conviction:  a mandatory term of life.  Despite the nominal characterization of the murders as conduct that was considered in \"enhancing\" or \"adjusting\" Lombard's firearms conviction, the reality is that the murders were treated as the gravamen of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the enhancing conduct in this case was serious, so too was the \"enhancement.\"   Attribution of the murders to Lombard operated not merely to ratchet up his prison term by some fractional increment, but rather wholly to remove the defendant's sentence from the term-of-years continuum and transform it into a life sentence without the prospect of parole.

In short, the enhancement at issue not only increased the duration of Lombard's sentence, but placed his punishment on an entirely different order of severity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This qualitative difference between the life sentence imposed and the term of years that Lombard might otherwise have received as a prior offender (262-327 months) implicates basic concerns of proportionality both between the enhancement and base sentence and between the offense and punishment as a whole.  Even if these concerns, considered alone, might not rise fully to the level of constitutional significance, they further distinguish this case from less troubling ones.  The comparative severity of the enhancement invites scrutiny of the weight given to factfinding as to ostensibly \"enhancing\" conduct (the murders) allocated to the sentencing phase, with its looser procedural constraints and lesser burden of proof.  It raises the danger of the defendant's trial and conviction being turned into a means of achieving an end that could not be achieved directly:  the imposition of a life sentence \"enhancement\" based on a federally unprosecutable murder.  In its interaction with the other concerns we describe, there is also an issue as to the proportion between the gravity of Lombard's offense of conviction and the severity of his punishment.  If a life sentence without parole is appropriate for murder, in most instances that sentence might appear to be harsh punishment for the unlawful possession of a rifle, even by a career criminal.  While one may doubt whether there are Eighth Amendment concerns<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> lurking here, cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Harmelin,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">997-1001</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. at 2702-05 (Opinion of Kennedy, J.), the harshness of the life sentence in relation to the offense of conviction highlights the need for rigorous inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without impugning the principle that acquitted conduct may be considered in determining a defendant's sentence, the prior state court acquittal presents another concern in its interaction here.  Lombard put the Maine government to its proof on the charges of murder against him, and a state court jury determined that reasonable doubt as to his guilt persisted.  The federal prosecution followed on the heels of the acquittal.  As the particular murders at issue were outside the sphere of the federal prosecutor's criminal charging power as to murder,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Lombard was not charged with murder in the federal indictment;  the murders themselves were not alleged by the government to be an object of the defendants' conspiracy;  and the federal jury was required to make no factual determination regarding the commission of the murders.  Yet it would ignore reality not to recognize that the federal prosecution arose out of and was driven by the murders, and that the prosecution was well aware that the Sentencing Guidelines would require consideration of the murders at sentencing.  This reality was reflected in the prosecution's statement at the pre-sentencing conference that \"it was quite clear from the beginning;  Mr. Lombard was looking at a life sentence.\"   The government, by its own words, had intended \"from the beginning\" that consideration of the murders would result in a life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through the post-trial adjudication of the murders under a lesser standard of proof, the federal prosecution obtained precisely the result that the Maine state prosecutors attempted, but failed, to obtain.  The federal prosecution may well have done better.  The net effect of the Guidelines attribution of the murders to Lombard as understood by the district court was to mandate imposition of a life sentence.  This was the maximum that Lombard could have received had he been convicted of murder in the Maine state court.  See Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 17-A, Sec. 1251 (setting minimum sentence of 25 years and maximum of life).  Indeed, a state murder conviction might have yielded something less severe than a life sentence.  See State v. St. Pierre, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1909568\"><a href=\"/opinion/1909568/state-v-st-pierre/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 621-22 (Me.1990) (vacating life sentence and reducing sentence to term of 45 years, where although defendant \"committed a brutal murder,\" the record failed to \"establish behavior at the outermost portion of the range of cruelty that would constitute the aggravating circumstances of extreme cruelty\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  In any event, in no circumstances under Maine law would Lombard have been subject to a mandatory life sentence.

Characterized in other terms, through the mechanisms of the Guidelines and accompanying legal doctrines, the sentencing phase of the defendant's trial produced the conclusion he had committed murder and mandated imposition of a life sentence, but without the protections which normally attend the criminal process, such as the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Given the magnitude of the sentence \"enhancement,\" the seriousness of the \"enhancing\" conduct in relation to the offense of conviction, and the seemingly mandatory imposition of the life sentence, this summary process effectively overshadowed the firearms possession charge and raises serious questions as to the proper allocation of the procedural protections attendant to trial versus sentencing.

Sec. 1B1.3 could include two murders of which Patriarca himself had not been charged, but which had been committed in furtherance of the conspiracy to which he had pleaded guilty.

Although defendant Patriarca himself had not been charged federally with murder, at least one of his confederates had pleaded guilty to such a charge in a related case.  See United States v. Patriarca, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></span>, 185 (D.Mass.1992), vacated, Carrozza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629118\"><a href=\"/opinion/629118/united-states-v-robert-f-carrozza-united-states-of-america-v-raymond-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>.   Certainly, there had been no acquittal.  Even more importantly, Carrozza 's holding was based on the explicit assumption that consideration of the murders would not necessarily result in a life sentence.  In fact, the district court had refused to consider the uncharged murders in sentencing Patriarca, troubled by the prospect of exposing the defendant to a life sentence on the basis of uncharged conduct.  This court rejected the premise of the district court's concern, explaining that Patriarca's offenses of conviction--RICO violations--carried statutory maximum sentences of twenty years each.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629118\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Carrozza,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/629118/united-states-v-robert-f-carrozza-united-states-of-america-v-raymond-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>.   But even so, the panel was careful to reserve decision as to whether there might remain a basis for concern if the district court were to order Patriarca to serve consecutive twenty-year sentences on each of his three RICO convictions, the practical equivalent of a life sentence.  The court openly acknowledged that it was troubled by this potentiality:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>At least one member of the panel believes that serious constitutional concerns may arise if the defendant ultimately receives the equivalent of a life sentence on the ground of his connection with a murder for which he was never indicted, tried or convicted by a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629118\"><a href=\"/opinion/629118/united-states-v-robert-f-carrozza-united-states-of-america-v-raymond-j/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 81 </a></span>n. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation hypothesized in Carrozza is closer to the one we face here, with added amplifying elements.  Lombard was acquitted of the murders by a state court jury.  Nonetheless he received not just \"the equivalent of a life sentence\" based on attribution of the murders, but a true life sentence, and a mandatory one at that.  Further, the sentence imposed may have been even more severe than what he would have received had he been convicted in state court.  We believe, as did \"at least one member of the panel\" in Carrozza, that the life sentence imposed upon the defendant raises \"serious constitutional concerns.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These concerns are reinforced by the Supreme Court's recent discussion in Witte v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span> </a></span>(1995).  The Court framed its analysis by asking when a sentence enhancement can properly be viewed as punishment for the offense of conviction, as opposed to punishment for the enhancing conduct.  While the case involved a Double Jeopardy and not a Due Process challenge, its discussion is instructive here:  if the life sentence that Lombard received can realistically be viewed as punishment for the murders, as opposed to punishment for the firearms offense, the constitutional difficulties alluded to in McMillan then come to the fore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Witte, the defendant had been convicted on a marijuana charge, then received an enhanced prison term in view of certain cocaine-related \"relevant conduct\" considered at sentencing.  Later, the defendant was prosecuted for that same cocaine-related conduct.  He objected on double jeopardy grounds, arguing that he had already been punished for the cocaine-related conduct by virtue of the sentence enhancement following the marijuana conviction.  The Supreme Court disagreed and held that the defendant had been punished in the first prosecution only for the offense of conviction (the marijuana charge), even though the sentencing court had considered the cocaine-related conduct in calculating his sentence.

In so concluding, however, the Court emphasized that the sentence for the defendant's offense of conviction (the marijuana charge) had carried a statutory maximum, and the \"enhancement\" to the defendant's sentence had merely fixed the term of imprisonment at some point closer to (but still below) that maximum:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>The relevant conduct provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines ... are sentencing enhancement regimes evincing the judgment that a particular offense should receive a more serious sentence within the authorized range if it was either accompanied by or preceded by additional criminal activity.

We hold that a sentence of life imprisonment was not an inexorable outcome under the Guidelines, that this case is within the scope of section 5K2.0 which provides flexibility, and that, under our decision in Rivera, the district court had authority to avoid any unfairness in Lombard's sentence through the mechanism of downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principles governing downward departures under the Sentencing Guidelines were comprehensively outlined by this court in United States v.

Sec. 5K2.0.  At Lombard's sentencing hearing, the district court expressed considerable unease at the sentence of mandatory life imprisonment that had resulted from its consideration, as required by the Guidelines, of Lombard's acquitted conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  The government asserted at the sentencing hearing that the Guidelines \"leave this court in essence no discretion whatsoever to sentence [Lombard] below life imprisonment [emphasis added].\"  The district court thought that it lacked authority to impose any sentence other than life imprisonment.  The court also did not consider whether the constitutional questions raised by the mandatory life sentence might warrant a finding that this case falls outside the heartland of the applicable guideline.  Thus, we conclude, as did the court in Rivera, that the district court erroneously believed it had no power to deviate from the sentence indicated by a straightforward application of the Guidelines and \"did not realize that it had the legal power to consider [downward] departure\" in the special circumstances presented.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts and circumstances of this case present a whole greater than the sum of its parts and distinguish it, from a constitutional perspective, from other cases that have involved facially similar issues.  The specific question from the perspective of the Guidelines and under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0 is whether these features of the case--e.g., the state court acquittal and the fact that the federal sentence may exceed any state sentence that would have attached to a murder conviction;  the paramount seriousness of the \"enhancing conduct\";  the magnitude of the \"enhancement\";  the disproportionality between the sentence and the offense of conviction as well as between the enhancement and the base sentence;  and the absence of a statutory maximum for the offense of conviction--taken in combination, make this case \"unusual\" and remove it from the \"heartland\" of the guideline (Sec. 2K2.1) that yielded the mandatory life sentence.  This case is outside the \"heartland.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission in writing U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c) was undoubtedly aware that the cross-reference provision might in some cases call for a defendant's base offense level to be determined by reference to the guideline governing murder.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c)(1)(B) (Nov. 1995).  But from our \"intermediate vantage point\" in the sentencing process, we try to place particular cases within \"a broader perspective of sentencing law,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">949</span></a></span>.   It seems to us unlikely that the Commission could have envisioned the particular combination of circumstances that in this case culminated in the mandatory life sentence and the corresponding institutional concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not constitutional concerns were raised by these circumstances, as we think they are, we conclude that their combination here gave the court power to depart under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.  That the application of the Guidelines that produced the mandatory life sentence does raise constitutional concerns only reinforces our conclusion.  This case may be viewed--virtually by definition--as an \"unusual\" one falling outside the heartland of section 2K2.1(c).  To decide otherwise would be to assume that the Commission intended that the application of section 2K2.1(c)'s cross-reference provisions could, even in a heartland case, produce sentences raising serious constitutional issues.  This we cannot do.  Cf. Burns v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 137-38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 39 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3222, quoted in United States v.

That sense of fairness is better served here by giving effect to the discretion preserved to the courts by the Commission in U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.  If a goal of the Guidelines is to \"avoid[ ] unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct,\" 28 U.S.C. Sec. 991(b)(1)(B), it is difficult to see how mandating imposition of a life sentence on the facts here serves that goal.  It is the conduct for which there has been no conviction which raises the sentence here to a life term, and then only by means of a finding by a mere preponderance of the evidence.  Yet a life term is the same sentence that would have been imposed for a conviction of murder.  Giving unbridled effect here to the cross-referenced murder guideline would, instead of furthering the goal of treating like cases alike, ignore the very real differences inherent in our system of criminal justice between a conviction for murder based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a firearms conviction enhanced by a finding that guns were used to commit the same murder based on a preponderance of the evidence.

Cf. United States v.

Sec. 2L1.2(b)(2) averts due process problems \"precisely because\" the district court has discretion to consider departure based on the individual facts of the case).  Certainly, a downward departure here would not be forbidden.  See id.;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597808\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Concepcion,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/597808/united-states-v-manuel-concepcion-roberto-aponte-and-nelson-frias/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>.   Had such a downward departure been considered, the impact of giving sentencing weight to the acquitted murders could have been tempered by the district court's fact-based, discretionary judgment.  That judgment would have been informed by the background principle that a sentence enhancement may not function as a \"tail which wags the dog\" of the defendant's offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approach adopted here is similar to that adopted by the Second Circuit, which has used the mechanism of downward departure to resolve a situation similar to this one.  In United States v. Concepcion, one of three codefendants (Frias) was convicted on a firearms charge but acquitted of a drug conspiracy charge.  On the firearms charges alone, the defendant's guidelines sentencing range would have been 12-18 months.  Applying the cross-reference in U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1 (the same provision at issue here), the district court had found that the defendant actually had engaged in the acquitted conduct, and thus determined his base offense level with reference to that conduct.  The result was a 24-level upward adjustment, with a final Guidelines sentencing range of 210-262 <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597808\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">months.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/597808/united-states-v-manuel-concepcion-roberto-aponte-and-nelson-frias/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit, reviewing settled circuit precedent, held that the district court had properly applied the Guidelines, and that the defendants' constitutional rights had not been violated by the consideration of the acquitted conspiracy charge.  Yet the court expressed serious discomfort with the magnitude of the sentence enhancement that had resulted.  It observed:  \"we doubt that, with respect to conduct of which the defendant was acquitted, the [Sentencing] Commission intended so extreme an increase.\"  Id.;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  see also United States v.

The court concluded that in the circumstances of that case, a downward departure under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0 might well have been warranted.  Because \"the [district] court apparently [had] not consider[ed] whether such a departure was permissible,\" the Second Circuit vacated the sentence and remanded for further proceedings.

We do share the doubts of the Second Circuit that the Sentencing Commission could have foreseen the kinds of circumstances which in this case have coalesced to produce a mandatory life sentence, and we agree that in these circumstances, a downward departure under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0 was within the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents difficult and delicate issues, not now susceptible of articulation through general rules.  Our concerns have arisen from a situation where acquitted conduct calling for a challenged sentence increase is itself very serious conduct, substantively more serious than the offense with which defendant was charged, where consideration of that conduct resulted in an enormous increase<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> in the sentence (including possibly beyond the sentence that would have been imposed for a conviction), where the ultimate sentence is itself enormous, and where the judge is seemingly mandated to impose that sentence.  Such a situation increases the risk that what the judge is required to and in fact is sentencing the defendant for is not the convicted offense as enhanced by relevant conduct, but directly for conduct as to which the defendant has not been charged, tried by a jury, nor convicted on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705988\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera-Gomez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/705988/united-states-v-luis-raul-rivera-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1001</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concerns which the district court expressed here are valid, and we have tried to state the reasons for those concerns, and forcefully so.

The outcome we adopt here should not be understood as an invitation to litigate constitutional or departure issues in usual cases involving sentence enhancements based on uncharged or acquitted conduct.

Hartley had also testified that Lombard told him on the morning of the murders that Hartley \"didn't have to take no shit from nobody\";  that Lombard and Hartley on that Thanksgiving morning saw Martin and Lindsey (the victims) sleeping on couches in the living room of Hartley's cabin;  and that Lombard had, after the murders, threatened to kill Hartley and Theriault if they did not \"stick\" to their plan to tell police, if questioned, that they had last seen the two victims on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartley's prior testimony from Lombard's state trial was admitted under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule, see Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>The following [is] not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>(1) Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, ... if the party against whom the testimony is now offered ... had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other conditions clearly being met, the only question is whether Lombard had \"similar motive\" at his state trial to \"develop\" Hartley's testimony through cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The party against whom the prior testimony is offered must have had a similar, not necessarily an identical, motive to develop the adverse testimony in the prior proceeding.

Because Lombard faced both liability as to murder and as to being an accomplice to murder under Maine law, he had a very forceful interest at his state trial in attacking Hartley's testimony, in order to discredit his account of the actual killings, the concealing of evidence and the attempt to escape prosecution.  This interest could hardly have been any stronger at the federal trial, see United States v. DiNapoli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656568\"><a href=\"/opinion/656568/united-states-v-vincent-dinapoli-louis-dinapoli-nicholas-auletta-edward/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span>, 914-15 (2d Cir.1993) (en banc), and the testimony, to the extent it related to the events preceding and following the murders, was properly admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartley's prior testimony from Lombard's trial concerning the .22 caliber rifle presents a different set of issues.  In contrast to the federal trial, Lombard had little real incentive at his state trial to attack Hartley's statements concerning possession or ownership of the rifle.  But Lombard himself admitted during the course of his own direct examination at his state trial that the .22 caliber rifle belonged to him.  Furthermore, other properly admitted evidence, including Tammy Theriault's testimony that Lombard owned the rifle, strongly corroborated Lombard's admission.  Thus, under the circumstances presented here, we believe any error arising from the admission of this portion of Hartley's prior testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admission of Hartley's former testimony from Lombard's state trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.  See U.S. Const. amend.  VI (\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\").  The Clause restricts but does not proscribe the admission of a declarant's prior testimony against a criminal defendant, requiring only that the declarant be \"unavailable\" and that the prior testimony sought to be admitted \"bear[ ] adequate 'indicia of reliability,' \" e.g., by \"fall[ing] within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\"   See Ohio v.

There are no such circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Lombard posed no Rule 403 objection to the admission of Hartley's and even his own former testimony about the murders undercuts his objection to Theriault's testimony.  Her testimony about Hartley's and Lombard's conduct in connection with the murders was at least equally relevant.  One of the objectives of the defendants' conspiracy charged was to \"flee the State of Maine in order to avoid prosecution or the giving of testimony in connection with the homicides of Morris Martin and Paul Lindsey, Jr.\"   The indictment also charged that the defendants conspired to \"dispose of certain evidence of Henry P. Lombard's unlawful possession\" of a firearm.  Proof of these charges required proof of the events surrounding the murders, the defendants' knowledge of the murders, and the defendants' joint conduct following the murders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court recognized that it was neither possible nor appropriate to excise all evidence of the murders from the government's proof of the defendants' conspiracy.  It correctly observed that the evidence touching on the murders had some prejudicial effect, but explicitly weighed that effect against its probative value, and decided in favor of admitting much, but not all, of the testimony offered.  There are no \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances\" that would warrant disturbing the district court's balancing of prejudice against probative value here.

The murders did not take place on any federal installation, were not in connection with the robbery of a federally insured bank or a robbery involving federally controlled substances, nor were committed in the course of a continuing criminal enterprise as defined by federal law.  Whether or not it could do so, the fact is that Congress has chosen not to federalize the state crime of murder in cases like Lombard's, and so has not authorized reprosecution for murder pursuant to the doctrine of separate sovereignties.

Thus, the issue raised is not one of Double Jeopardy, nor, strictly speaking, of the reach of the federal power, but one of Due Process:  whether the sentencing court is precluded from considering that the Sentencing Guidelines as applied, through the vehicle of sentence enhancement, effectively punishes the defendant for conduct as to which there exists no statutory authorization for the government even to prosecute</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> If Lombard had been convicted of murder in the Maine state court and received a sentence of a term of years, he would have been eligible to receive credit against time to be served under the \"good time\" provisions of state law, which are considerably more generous than similar federal provisions.

After he pleaded guilty, Count 3 of the indictment was dismissed as to him on the government's motion.  Hartley's BOL of 12 as to Count 1, with a criminal history category of I, would have yielded a sentence of 10-16 months.  The district court found that Hartley, like Lombard, was subject to the cross-reference provision of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c).  But, as the government informed us at oral argument, Hartley--who did not qualify as a career criminal--had the benefit of a five-year statutory maximum on his conviction under Count 1, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, which is what he received after his plea.  (Had Count 3 not been dismissed, Hartley likely would have been subject to the ten-year statutory maximum contained in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(a)(2) for aiding and abetting the firearms offense.)   Thus, for Hartley, consideration of the murders under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(c) only had the effect of increasing his sentence from a base of 10-16 months to the statutory maximum of five years, even though Tammy Theriault's testimony indicated that Hartley shared at least equal blame with Lombard for the murders</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Cases from other circuits addressing the permissibility of considering acquitted (or uncharged) conduct at sentencing generally have involved only modest sentence increases, or increases that were within a stated statutory maximum, or both, and so provide little guidance here.
