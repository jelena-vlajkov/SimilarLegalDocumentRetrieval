On February  18,\n                                         \n\n1992, Carl  Laliberte was charged in  a five-count indictment\n\nwith conspiring  with seven  others to  possess in  excess of\n\nfive  kilograms  of  cocaine  with intent  to  distribute  in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846 (1988)\n\n(Count One), possessing cocaine  with intent to distribute in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) (1988) and\n\n18 U.S.C.    2 (1988)  (Counts Two through  Four), and  using\n\nreal property to commit violations of 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1),\n\n846 (1988) so  that the  property was  subject to  forfeiture\n\npursuant to  21 U.S.C.   853  (1988) (Count Five).   On April\n\n27, 1992,  Laliberte pleaded  guilty to  Counts One  and Five\n\npursuant to  an Agreement To Plead Guilty  And Cooperate (the\n\n\"Cooperation Agreement\") entered into  with the United States\n\nAttorney  for  the  District  of   Maine  (the  \"Government\")\n\npursuant  to  Fed. R.  Crim.  P.  11.   On  October 6,  1992,\n\nLaliberte, prior  to sentencing,  filed a motion  to withdraw\n\nhis  guilty plea.  The  United States District  Court for the\n\nDistrict of Maine, on  May 21, 1993, entered a  memorandum of\n\ndecision  and order  denying Laliberte's  motion.   Laliberte\n\nappeals from this decision.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n          The  April 27, 1992,  Cooperation Agreement between\n\nLaliberte  and  the  Government,  in  addition  to  requiring\n\n                             -2-\n\nLaliberte to plead guilty  to Counts One and  Five, provided,\n\ninter alia, that Laliberte would \n          \n          meet  with  attorneys and  agents  of the\n          Government,  as  needed,  to tell  fully,\n          honestly,  truthfully and  completely all\n          that  the defendant kn[ew] or ha[d] heard\n          about  violations  of  federal and  state\n          laws,  including but  not limited  to the\n          defendant's    involvement    and     the\n          involvement  of  others in  violations of\n          law  . . .  .  The  defendant agree[d] to\n          provide   the   Government  or   aid  the\n          Government  in  acquiring all  documents,\n          photographs, bills, records, receipts and\n          all like materials to which the defendant\n          ha[d]  access, which  w[ould] corroborate\n          this  information.     Defendant  further\n          agree[d]  to   testify  fully,  honestly,\n          truthfully and completely  at any and all\n          grand  juries,  trials or  other official\n          proceedings in which his  testimony [was]\n          requested.\n\nLaliberte  also consented  to  \"assist the  United States  in\n\neffecting the  forfeiture or  other transfer of  any property\n\n. . . subject to  forfeiture to  the United States  under any\n\nlaw  of  the United  States.\"   In  exchange  for Laliberte's\n\ncompliance  with its  terms  and conditions,  the Cooperation\n\nAgreement stated  that the  Government (1) \"may  petition the\n\nCourt for the imposition of any lawful sentence,\" see Fed. R.\n                                                     \n\nCrim.  P. 11(e)(1)(B), and  (2) \"will move  to dismiss Counts\n\nTwo,  Three and  Four  of the  indictment  after sentence  is\n\nimposed,\"1   see  Fed.   R.  Crim.   P.  11(e)(1)(A).     The\n                \n\nCooperation Agreement left to the sole judgment of the United\n\n                    \n\n1.  Counts Two through  Four were, in fact, dismissed  on the\nGovernment's motion.\n\n                             -3-\n\nStates Attorney  for the District of  Maine whether Laliberte\n\nhad  complied with its  terms and conditions     although the\n\nGovernment promised  that, at Laliberte's  request, it  would\n\n\"make  known the  cooperation  provided by  defendant to  any\n\nindividual  or  entity  to   whom  defendant  wishe[d]   such\n\ninformation disseminated.\"  A decision that Laliberte had not\n\ncooperated was  to have  \"a material and  articulable basis.\"\n\nFinally,  the  Cooperation  Agreement  expressly  stated that\n\n\"[n]othing in this agreement  shall be interpreted to require\n\nthe United States to move the Court pursuant to United States\n\nSentencing Commission Sentencing Guideline Section  5K1.1 for\n\na downward departure.\" \n\n          Laliberte   maintains,  and  the  record  tends  to\n\nconfirm,  that   after  the  execution  of   the  Cooperation\n\nAgreement he assisted  the Bureau  of Intergovernmental  Drug\n\nEnforcement (the \"BIDE\") and the Drug Enforcement Agency (the\n\n\"DEA\")  on at  least one  occasion.   His cooperation  was in\n\nregard to  the controlled purchase of six pounds of marijuana\n\n    a transaction that led to the  arrest, on May 4, 1992, of\n\nan  individual named Hank  Dresser    the  seizure of fifteen\n\npounds  of  marijuana,  and  the  criminal  forfeiture  of  a\n\nresidence.\n\n          Laliberte's  collaboration   was,  however,  short-\n\nlived.   On  May  5,  1992, James  Hollywood,  United  States\n\nPretrial/Probation  Officer, complained to the district court\n\n                             -4-\n\nby  memorandum  that  his  office  had  not  been  told  that\n\nLaliberte   was  assisting  government   agents.    Hollywood\n\nasserted  that it  was  improper for  Laliberte to  cooperate\n\nwithout the permission of the court and others, including the\n\nprobation officer.  In response, the district court issued an\n\norder on May 6, 1992, directing the cessation  of Laliberte's\n\nactive law enforcement cooperation.2\n\n          About three  months later, on August  10, 1992, the\n\nGovernment filed  a motion  requesting the district  court to\n\npermit Laliberte  to resume  his active cooperation  with law\n\nenforcement  agencies.  This motion was allowed on August 15,\n\n1992.   On September 30,  1992, however, it  appears that the\n\ndistrict  court  vacated  its  August 15,  1992,  order,  and\n\n                    \n\n2.  The order stated:\n\n          It having been brought to the attention of the\n     Court  that the  Defendant herein,  Carl Laliberte,\n     has   been  engaged   in  active   law  enforcement\n                                     \n     cooperative activities at  the instigation of  BIDE\n     and DEA officials .  . . without first seeking  the\n     consent of Defendant's supervising officer  and the\n                                                        \n     approval  of  the  Court,  and that  such  activity\n                             \n     interferes with, disrupts,  and defeats the Court's\n     efforts,  through its  duly appointed  officers, to\n     properly  supervise  said  Defendant  while  he  is\n     subject to the authority of the Court.\n\n          It  is hereby, in consequence thereof, ORDERED\n                                                        \n     that  all active  participation  of Defendant  Carl\n     Laliberte  in cooperative or  other law enforcement\n     activity CEASE, forthwith, pending further order of\n                   \n     this Court.\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n                             -5-\n\nreinstated  its  May  6,  1992, order  which  had  proscribed\n\nLaliberte's active cooperation. \n\n          Nearly a week later,  on October 6, 1992, Laliberte\n\nmoved to withdraw his  guilty plea pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.\n\nP. 32(d).3  The motion  asserted, inter alia, that, following\n                                            \n\nthe district court's May  6, 1992, order, Laliberte's counsel\n\nhad asked  the Government on May  8, June 17, and  June 25 to\n\ntake whatever action was necessary to have that order lifted.\n\nLaliberte's motion further maintained that the Government had\n\n\"refused to take  any action  to have the  order lifted,  and\n\n[had]  informed  defense counsel  of  its  position that  the\n\n[district court] lack[ed] the authority to interfere with the\n\nactive cooperation of a defendant with government agents, and\n\nthat it would  not seek the [district  court's] permission to\n\nallow  such  active  cooperation   because  to  do  so  would\n\nacknowledge that  authority.\"   In light of  the Government's\n\nalleged \"failure to provide  the information requested by the\n\nProbation Officer to  consider consenting to  the defendant's\n\ncooperation,  and  its failure  to seek  the approval  of the\n\n[district court]  to allow such cooperation,\"  the withdrawal\n\n                    \n\n3.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(d) states in relevant part:\n\n          If a motion for withdrawal of a plea of guilty\n     or  nolo  contendere  is  made before  sentence  is\n     imposed,  imposition of  sentence is  suspended, or\n     disposition is  had under 18 U.S.C.    4205(c), the\n     court  may permit  withdrawal  of the  plea upon  a\n     showing  by  the defendant  of  any  fair and  just\n     reason. . . .\n\n                             -6-\n\nmotion argued that Laliberte had been denied \"the opportunity\n\nto earn the filing  of a motion for downward  departure which\n\nthe Government had  promised him.\"   In this  same vein,  the\n\nfinal paragraph of the motion concluded:\n\n          Since  the  Government  would   not  have\n          allowed   the   defendant   to   actively\n          cooperate  unless  he  agreed   to  plead\n          guilty,   and   since  the   Government's\n          representation to the  defendant that  he\n          would  be given the opportunity to earn a\n          downward  departure  through such  active\n          cooperation  was   the  most  significant\n          factor  in the  defendant's determination\n          to plead guilty, the Government's failure\n          to  seek the  consent  of  the  Probation\n          Officer and the approval of the [district\n          court] in a  timely manner to  allow such\n          active  cooperation  frustrated the  very\n          basis  of  the  defendant's  decision  to\n          enter  into  the  plea  agreement  and to\n          plead guilty.\n\nOn  May  21,  1993,  the district  court  denied  Laliberte's\n\nmotion,  concluding that he had \"failed to meet his burden of\n\ndemonstrating  a `fair and just'  reason to withdraw his plea\n\nof guilty entered in this case.\"  \n\n          In  spite of the district court's having prohibited\n\nLaliberte   from  actively   assisting  in   cooperative  law\n\nenforcement  activities, the  Government, on  June 15,  1993,\n\nmoved both to dismiss  Counts Two, Three and Four,  and for a\n\ndownward departure  in his  sentence, pursuant to  U.S.S.G.  \n\n5K1.1  and  18  U.S.C.    3553(e)  (1988).    The  Government\n\ndeclared that  Laliberte had substantially  assisted \"in  the\n\ninvestigation  and  apprehension of  others.\"   The  district\n\n                             -7-\n\ncourt granted the  Government's motion, dismissing the  three\n\ncounts and  reducing Laliberte's prison term  to sixty months\n\nfrom the  applicable Sentencing Guidelines  range of seventy-\n\neight to ninety-seven  months.4 Laliberte was  also sentenced\n\nto  serve four years of supervised release and to forfeit his\n\ninterest in  real property in  Auburn, Maine.   Judgment  was\n\nentered on July 12, 1993.\n\n          On appeal, Laliberte now contends that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion  when on May 21, 1993,  it denied\n\nhis motion to withdraw  his guilty plea.  In  considering his\n\nargument, we consider the May 21, 1993, order in light of the\n\nsubsequent  sentencing  actions,  including the  Government's\n\nrequest, accepted  by the court, to dismiss  the three counts\n\nand reduce the sentence.\n\n                             II.\n\n                              A.\n\n          The district court's  decision denying  Laliberte's\n\nmotion  to withdraw  his guilty  plea is reviewed  solely for\n\nabuse of  discretion.  See United  States v. Parrilla-Tirado,\n                                                            \n\n   F.3d   ,  , 1994 WL 143251, at *1 (1st Cir.

Laliberte argues that he should have been allowed to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea  because, by virtue of the  district\n\ncourt's  sua  sponte  order  prohibiting  him  from  actively\n                    \n\nassisting the BIDE and the DEA, he was denied the opportunity\n\nto  perform his end of  the Cooperation Agreement,  or, as he\n\nsays, he was compelled \"to breach the agreement he signed.\"  \n\n          Had the district court's prohibition operated so as\n\nto  deny Laliberte  the  benefit of  his bargain,  that might\n\nindeed  have been a plausible reason to allow him to renounce\n\nhis  plea.    But  Laliberte  mischaracterizes  what actually\n\nhappened.   Laliberte pled guilty on the basis of a so-called\n\nCooperation Agreement, which burdened  him with meeting  with\n\ngovernment agents,  \"as needed,\"  to tell all  he knew  about\n\nviolations  of   law  and   providing  testimony   and  other\n\nassistance, as requested.   If he  did this, the  Cooperation\n\nAgreement provided that the  Government (1) \"may petition the\n\nCourt for  the imposition of  any lawful  sentence,\" and  (2)\n\nwould  \"move to  dismiss Counts  Two, Three  and Four  of the\n\n                             -11-\n\nindictment after sentence [was]  imposed.\"  The U.S. Attorney\n\nwas to  be  the sole  judge  of Laliberte's  compliance,  and\n\npromised  to make  known  Laliberte's cooperation  to  anyone\n\nLaliberte requested.  The Cooperation Agreement flatly stated\n\nthat  nothing therein  required the  Government \"to  move the\n\nCourt  pursuant   to  United  States   Sentencing  Commission\n\nSentencing Guideline Section 5K1.1 for a downward departure.\"\n\n          In  fact,   the  Government  ultimately   moved  to\n\ndismiss, and the district  court dismissed, Counts Two, Three\n\nand Four of the indictment, thus giving to Laliberte the full\n\nbenefit  of  its promise  under  (2).   The  Government  also\n\ncomplied  with (1)  by petitioning  for \"a  lawful sentence,\"\n\nand, in  so doing,  disregarded its right,  elsewhere stated,\n\nnot to  seek a downward  departure.  To  Laliberte's benefit,\n   \n\nthe  Government moved for, and  the district court granted, a\n\nsignificant downward departure in Laliberte's sentence on the\n\ngrounds of his substantial assistance.  \n\n          The  Government's recommendations,  incorporated in\n\nthe   district  court's  final   judgment,  accordingly  gave\n\nLaliberte the  full benefit of  his bargain for  dismissal of\n\nthe  three charges,  and also  gave Laliberte  an additional,\n\nunpromised   benefit  (the   downward  departure)   that  the\n\nCooperation Agreement had expressly stated the Government was\n\nnot  required  to provide.    The  stated  premise  of  these\n   \n\n                             -12-\n\nbenefits was that Laliberte had  substantially assisted, thus\n\nperforming  his  share  of  the bargain  as  to  cooperating.\n\nWhatever can be said had Laliberte been denied these benefits\n                                              \n\nbecause of asserted non-cooperation, we can see no basis  for\n\nhis  claim of  having been  denied the  right to  perform his\n\nshare of the agreement where the Government acknowledged that\n\nhe  had  met  his  obligations and  accorded  him  everything\n\npromised  in the event of  his performance     with a sizable\n\nbonus (the downward departure) to boot.  \n\n          Laliberte  suggests that  had  he been  allowed  to\n\ncooperate  for the  entire time,  he would,  in some  way not\n\nexplained,   been  so   extraordinarily   helpful  that   the\n\nGovernment  might have  requested  an  even greater  downward\n\ndeparture.   But as the  Government pointed out  at argument,\n\nwhat opportunities are extended to an informer to  help catch\n\nothers are  necessarily  always subject  to the  Government's\n\ncontrol and  veto.  The Cooperation  Agreement, moreover, was\n\ndevoid of  any promise by  the Government to  allow Laliberte\n\nthe right to engage in unlimited cooperation; cooperation was\n\nrather a duty imposed on Laliberte as needed and requested   \n                                                          \n\na  duty  which,  if satisfied  in  the  opinion  of the  U.S.\n\nAttorney, would  result in the guaranteed  dismissal of three\n\ncounts  and  possibly,  though  only  by   implication,  some\n\nunspecified   recommendations    for   sentencing   leniency.\n\nWhatever  promise of sentence reduction was implied, however,\n\n                             -13-\n\nwas  offset by  the  Government's express  disclaimer of  any\n\nright  to  a  downward  departure.    Under  the  Cooperation\n\nAgreement as so written,  Laliberte would doubtless have been\n\nentitled to  complain had  his  chance to  cooperate been  so\n\nvitiated as to remove all possibility of earning the promised\n\ndismissal  of the three counts, and  possibly    although far\n\nless clearly    to earn some sentencing leniency.  But where,\n\nas here, his cooperation sufficed both to secure dismissal of\n\nthe three  counts and a discretionary  downward departure, we\n                     \n\nsee  no plausibility in the  claim that he  was deprived of a\n\nfair and  sufficient  chance  to  fulfill  his  part  of  the\n\ncontract.\n\n          2.   Timing.  \"The timing of a motion to withdraw a\n                     \n\nguilty plea is  significant.  Delayed requests,  even if made\n\nbefore  sentencing, are  generally  regarded with  disfavor.\"\n\nParrilla-Tirado, 1994 WL 143251, at *4 (citing Pellerito, 878\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 1541); e.g., Doyle, 981 U.S.  at 595.  Generally, the\n                          \n\nlonger  a  defendant  waits  before bringing  his  motion  to\n\nwithdraw his guilty  plea, the more  forceful his reasons  in\n\nsupport of  withdrawal must be.   E.g., Parrilla-Tirado, 1994\n                                                       \n\nWL 143251,  at *4; Doyle,  981 F.2d at  595.  This  principle\n                        \n\nobtains because,  \"[w]hile an  immediate change of  heart may\n\nwell lend considerable force to  a plea withdrawal request, a\n\nlong interval between the plea and the request  often weakens\n\n                             -14-\n\nany claim that  the plea  was entered in  confusion or  under\n\nfalse pretenses.\"  Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595 (citing cases).\n                        \n\n          Here, Laliberte  entered his guilty  plea on  April\n\n27, 1992.  The district court's order prohibiting his  active\n\ninvolvement with  law enforcement  agencies was filed  just a\n\nlittle more than  a week later on May 6,  1992.  Although the\n\ndistrict  court  vacated  that  order  on  August  15,  1992,\n\nLaliberte  contends  that,  by  that time,  he  had  lost all\n\nopportunity   to  cooperate   because  sentencing   was  then\n\nscheduled for  September 21, 1992.5   Accordingly,  Laliberte\n\nmoved the  district  court to  withdraw  his guilty  plea  on\n\nOctober 6, 1992    more than five months after he had entered\n\nit and  five months to the day after the district court's May\n\n6, 1992, order.  Laliberte attributes much of this five-month\n\ndelay  to time \"spent trying to  resolve the problem\" created\n\nby  the district court's order.  One can argue, however, that\n\nLaliberte's   efforts  to   promote   the  efficacy   of  the\n\nCooperation Agreement over several months after its execution\n\nmake  it less  likely  that he  entered  his guilty  plea  in\n\n\"confusion or under false  pretenses.\"  Id.  But  because the\n                                           \n\ntiming issue  is essentially immaterial to  our outcome here,\n\nwe  see no need to resolve it.   Even assuming the motion was\n\ntimely, it fails on its merits.\n\n                    \n\n5.  Sentencing was eventually continued until the first  week\nof July 1993.\n\n                             -15-\n\n          3.   Claim   of  Innocence.     Courts   look  more\n                                    \n\nfavorably  on a  motion to  withdraw a  guilty plea  when the\n\nmotion is  accompanied by an  assertion of innocence.   E.g.,\n                                                            \n\nParrilla-Tirado, 1994 WL  143251, at *4;  Doyle, 981 F.2d  at\n                                               \n\n596.  Conversely, \"the absence of a claim of innocence weighs\n\nin favor of  allowing a guilty  plea to  stand.\"  Doyle,  981\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 596; e.g, Parrilla-Tirado, 1994 WL 143251, at *4.  In\n                                 \n\nthis case, Laliberte concedes that  he admitted his guilt  at\n\nthe Rule  11 proceeding.  See  Fed. R. Crim. P.  11.  Neither\n                             \n\nhis  motion  to withdraw  his guilty  plea nor  his appellate\n\nbrief  contains  an assertion  of  innocence.6   \"Thus,  this\n\nfactor cuts  sharply against allowing [Laliberte's] motion to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea.\"   Parrilla-Tirado, 1994 WL 143251,\n                                            \n\nat *4.\n\n          4.   Voluntariness.  \"In  assaying the merits of  a\n                            \n\nmotion  to  withdraw,  an  inquiring  court   must  determine\n\nwhether, in light of the defendant's proffered reason and any\n\nnewly disclosed facts, the plea may still be deemed voluntary\n\nand  intelligent.\"   Doyle,  981 F.2d  at 596  (citing United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Austin, 948  F.2d 783, 786-87 (1st Cir.  1991), and\n                \n\n                    \n\n6.  The   district  court  noted  that  Laliberte  argued  in\nDefendant's Reply  To Government's Opposition  To Defendant's\nMotion To  Withdraw Guilty Plea  that he had  represented his\nlegal innocence to his  counsel.  The district court  was not\nimpressed by this argument, observing that at no  time during\nthe proceedings  did Laliberte assert his  legal innocence to\nthe court.\n\n                             -16-\n\nUnited States v.  Allard, 926  F.2d 1237,  1245-47 (1st  Cir.\n                        \n\n1991)).  \n\n          Laliberte   maintains  that   he  would   not  have\n\nvoluntarily  entered a guilty plea had he known that within a\n\nmonth  of doing  so the  district court  would proscribe  his\n\nactive cooperation with law enforcement agencies, and thereby\n\nvitiate  his  ability to  earn  a downward  departure  in his\n\nsentence.7     We   think,  however,   that  the   denial  of\n\nLaliberte's motion  to withdraw his plea must now be reviewed\n\nin light  of the Government's actual  recommendations and the\n\nfinal  judgment that  was entered.    This court  asks simply\n\nwhether,   given  what   finally   happened,  including   the\n\nGovernment's favorable recommendations, the court's dismissal\n\nof  the counts,  and the  reduced sentence,  Laliberte's plea\n\nstill appears  to have been  voluntary and intelligent.   For\n\nreasons  already  largely  discussed  above,  see supra  part\n                                                       \n\nII.B.1, the answer is clearly \"Yes.\"\n\n          It is  true the district court's May 6, 1992, order\n\nprevented  Laliberte from  continuing  to  assist  government\n\nagencies  during  much of  the  period  prior to  sentencing.\n\nStill, he  rendered some assistance  and, more to  the point,\n\nthat assistance sufficed for him to receive all the  benefits\n\n   and more     promised to him in the  Cooperation Agreement\n\n                    \n\n7.  Laliberte  does not  argue that  his initial  decision to\nplead guilty  was made involuntarily,  unintelligently, or in\nviolation of the requirements of Rule 11.\n\n                             -17-\n\nin return for  his assistance.   In exchange for  Laliberte's\n\npromise  to  plead  guilty to  Counts  One  and  Five and  to\n\ncooperate with  government agencies, the  Government, in  the\n\nCooperation Agreement, had agreed  to \"move to dismiss Counts\n\nTwo, Three  and Four of  the indictment after  sentence [was]\n\nimposed.\"  The Government further said that it  \"may petition\n\nthe  Court  for  the  imposition  of  any  lawful  sentence,\"\n\nalthough  the  Cooperation  Agreement  expressly  stated that\n\n\"[n]othing in this agreement  shall be interpreted to require\n\nthe United States to move the Court pursuant to United States\n\nSentencing Commission Sentencing Guideline Section  5K1.1 for\n\na downward departure.\"   Thus, Laliberte voluntarily  pleaded\n\nguilty on April  27, 1992, with  no assurances whatever,  but\n\nonly  a bare hope, that he would receive a downward departure\n\nin his sentence.  Ultimately, the district court, pursuant to\n\nthe Government's  motions,  not only  dismissed  Counts  Two,\n\nThree  and Four,  but  also, by  downward departure,  reduced\n\nLaliberte's prison  term to  sixty months from  the guideline\n\nrange of  seventy-eight to ninety-seven months.  Accordingly,\n\nwhen viewed in light of all of these \"emergent circumstances\"\n                           \n\n    not just  the  district court's  May  6, 1992,  order    \n\nrevealing that  Laliberte received no less  and, indeed, more\n\nthan he had been promised if he pleaded guilty, we cannot say\n\nthat  Laliberte's guilty  plea  was rendered  involuntary  or\n\nunintelligent by subsequent events. \n\n                             -18-\n\n          Affirmed. \n                  \n\n                             -19-\n",

The Cooperation Agreement left to the sole judgment of the United States Attorney for the District of Maine whether Laliberte had complied with its terms and conditions--although the Government promised that, at Laliberte's request, it would \"make known the cooperation provided by defendant to any individual or entity to whom defendant wishe[d] such information disseminated.\"   A decision that Laliberte had not cooperated was to have \"a material and articulable basis.\"   Finally, the Cooperation Agreement expressly stated that \"[n]othing in this agreement shall be interpreted to require the United States to move the Court pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission Sentencing Guideline Section 5K1.1 for a downward departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laliberte maintains, and the record tends to confirm, that after the execution of the Cooperation Agreement he assisted the Bureau of Intergovernmental Drug Enforcement (the \"BIDE\") and the Drug Enforcement Agency (the \"DEA\") on at least one occasion.  His cooperation was in regard to the controlled purchase of six pounds of marijuana--a transaction that led to the arrest, on May 4, 1992, of an individual named Hank Dresser--the seizure of fifteen pounds of marijuana, and the criminal forfeiture of a residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laliberte's collaboration was, however, short-lived.  On May 5, 1992, James Hollywood, United States Pretrial/Probation Officer, complained to the district court by memorandum that his office had not been told that Laliberte was assisting government agents.  Hollywood asserted that it was improper for Laliberte to cooperate without the permission of the court and others, including the probation officer.  In response, the district court issued an order on May 6, 1992, directing the cessation of Laliberte's active law enforcement cooperation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About three months later, on August 10, 1992, the Government filed a motion requesting the district court to permit Laliberte to resume his active cooperation with law enforcement agencies.  This motion was allowed on August 15, 1992.  On September 30, 1992, however, it appears that the district court vacated its August 15, 1992, order, and reinstated its May 6, 1992, order which had proscribed Laliberte's active cooperation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly a week later, on October 6, 1992, Laliberte moved to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The motion asserted, inter alia, that, following the district court's May 6, 1992, order, Laliberte's counsel had asked the Government on May 8, June 17, and June 25 to take whatever action was necessary to have that order lifted.  Laliberte's motion further maintained that the Government had \"refused to take any action to have the order lifted, and [had] informed defense counsel of its position that the [district court] lack[ed] the authority to interfere with the active cooperation of a defendant with government agents, and that it would not seek the [district court's] permission to allow such active cooperation because to do so would acknowledge that authority.\"   In light of the Government's alleged \"failure to provide the information requested by the Probation Officer to consider consenting to the defendant's cooperation, and its failure to seek the approval of the [district court] to allow such cooperation,\" the withdrawal motion argued that Laliberte had been denied \"the opportunity to earn the filing of a motion for downward departure which the Government had promised him.\"   In this same vein, the final paragraph of the motion concluded:Since the Government would not have allowed the defendant to actively cooperate unless he agreed to plead guilty, and since the Government's representation to the defendant that he would be given the opportunity to earn a downward departure through such active cooperation was the most significant factor in the defendant's determination to plead guilty, the Government's failure to seek the consent of the Probation Officer and the approval of the [district court] in a timely manner to allow such active cooperation frustrated the very basis of the defendant's decision to enter into the plea agreement and to plead guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 1993, the district court denied Laliberte's motion, concluding that he had \"failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a 'fair and just' reason to withdraw his plea of guilty entered in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of the district court's having prohibited Laliberte from actively assisting in cooperative law enforcement activities, the Government, on June 15, 1993, moved both to dismiss Counts Two, Three and Four, and for a downward departure in his sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(e) (1988).  The Government declared that Laliberte had substantially assisted \"in the investigation and apprehension of others.\"   The district court granted the Government's motion, dismissing the three counts and reducing Laliberte's prison term to sixty months from the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range of seventy-eight to ninety-seven months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Laliberte was also sentenced to serve four years of supervised release and to forfeit his interest in real property in Auburn, Maine.

In considering his argument, we consider the May 21, 1993, order in light of the subsequent sentencing actions, including the Government's request, accepted by the court, to dismiss the three counts and reduce the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision denying Laliberte's motion to withdraw his guilty plea is reviewed solely for abuse of discretion.

Plausibility and Force of the Proffered Reasons.   A defendant may not renounce his guilty plea without advancing a plausible reason for doing so.  See, e.g., Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 371;  Doyle, 981 F.2d at 594;  United States v. Tilley, 964 F.2d 66, 72-73 (1st Cir.1992).  Laliberte argues that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because, by virtue of the district court's sua sponte order prohibiting him from actively assisting the BIDE and the DEA, he was denied the opportunity to perform his end of the Cooperation Agreement, or, as he says, he was compelled \"to breach the agreement he signed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the district court's prohibition operated so as to deny Laliberte the benefit of his bargain, that might indeed have been a plausible reason to allow him to renounce his plea.  But Laliberte mischaracterizes what actually happened.  Laliberte pled guilty on the basis of a so-called Cooperation Agreement, which burdened him with meeting with government agents, \"as needed,\" to tell all he knew about violations of law and providing testimony and other assistance, as requested.  If he did this, the Cooperation Agreement provided that the Government (1) \"may petition the Court for the imposition of any lawful sentence,\" and (2) would \"move to dismiss Counts Two, Three and Four of the indictment after sentence [was] imposed.\"   The U.S. Attorney was to be the sole judge of Laliberte's compliance, and promised to make known Laliberte's cooperation to anyone Laliberte requested.  The Cooperation Agreement flatly stated that nothing therein required the Government \"to move the Court pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission Sentencing Guideline Section 5K1.1 for a downward departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the Government ultimately moved to dismiss, and the district court dismissed, Counts Two, Three and Four of the indictment, thus giving to Laliberte the full benefit of its promise under (2).  The Government also complied with (1) by petitioning for \"a lawful sentence,\" and, in so doing, disregarded its right, elsewhere stated, not to seek a downward departure.  To Laliberte's benefit, the Government moved for, and the district court granted, a significant downward departure in Laliberte's sentence on the grounds of his substantial assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government's recommendations, incorporated in the district court's final judgment, accordingly gave Laliberte the full benefit of his bargain for dismissal of the three charges, and also gave Laliberte an additional, unpromised benefit (the downward departure) that the Cooperation Agreement had expressly stated the Government was not required to provide.  The stated premise of these benefits was that Laliberte had substantially assisted, thus performing his share of the bargain as to cooperating.  Whatever can be said had Laliberte been denied these benefits because of asserted non-cooperation, we can see no basis for his claim of having been denied the right to perform his share of the agreement where the Government acknowledged that he had met his obligations and accorded him everything promised in the event of his performance--with a sizable bonus (the downward departure) to boot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laliberte suggests that had he been allowed to cooperate for the entire time, he would, in some way not explained, been so extraordinarily helpful that the Government might have requested an even greater downward departure.  But as the Government pointed out at argument, what opportunities are extended to an informer to help catch others are necessarily always subject to the Government's control and veto.  The Cooperation Agreement, moreover, was devoid of any promise by the Government to allow Laliberte the right to engage in unlimited cooperation;  cooperation was rather a duty imposed on Laliberte as needed and requested--a duty which, if satisfied in the opinion of the U.S. Attorney, would result in the guaranteed dismissal of three counts and possibly, though only by implication, some unspecified recommendations for sentencing leniency.  Whatever promise of sentence reduction was implied, however, was offset by the Government's express disclaimer of any right to a downward departure.  Under the Cooperation Agreement as so written, Laliberte would doubtless have been entitled to complain had his chance to cooperate been so vitiated as to remove all possibility of earning the promised dismissal of the three counts, and possibly--although far less clearly--to earn some sentencing leniency.  But where, as here, his cooperation sufficed both to secure dismissal of the three counts and a discretionary downward departure, we see no plausibility in the claim that he was deprived of a fair and sufficient chance to fulfill his part of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Timing.  \"The timing of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is significant.  Delayed requests, even if made before sentencing, are generally regarded with disfavor.\"  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373 (citing Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1541);  e.g., Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595.   Generally, the longer a defendant waits before bringing his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the more forceful his reasons in support of withdrawal must be.  E.g., Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373;  Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595.   This principle obtains because, \"[w]hile an immediate change of heart may well lend considerable force to a plea withdrawal request, a long interval between the plea and the request often weakens any claim that the plea was entered in confusion or under false pretenses.\"  Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595 (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Laliberte entered his guilty plea on April 27, 1992.  The district court's order prohibiting his active involvement with law enforcement agencies was filed just a little more than a week later on May 6, 1992.  Although the district court vacated that order on August 15, 1992, Laliberte contends that, by that time, he had lost all opportunity to cooperate because sentencing was then scheduled for September 21, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Accordingly, Laliberte moved the district court to withdraw his guilty plea on October 6, 1992--more than five months after he had entered it and five months to the day after the district court's May 6, 1992, order.  Laliberte attributes much of this five-month delay to time \"spent trying to resolve the problem\" created by the district court's order.  One can argue, however, that Laliberte's efforts to promote the efficacy of the Cooperation Agreement over several months after its execution make it less likely that he entered his guilty plea in \"confusion or under false pretenses.\"  Id.  But because the timing issue is essentially immaterial to our outcome here, we see no need to resolve it.  Even assuming the motion was timely, it fails on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Claim of Innocence.   Courts look more favorably on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea when the motion is accompanied by an assertion of innocence.  E.g., Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373;  Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596.   Conversely, \"the absence of a claim of innocence weighs in favor of allowing a guilty plea to stand.\"  Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596;  e.g., Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373.   In this case, Laliberte concedes that he admitted his guilt at the Rule 11 proceeding.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 11.  Neither his motion to withdraw his guilty plea nor his appellate brief contains an assertion of innocence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  \"Thus, this factor cuts sharply against allowing [Laliberte's] motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\"  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Voluntariness.  \"In assaying the merits of a motion to withdraw, an inquiring court must determine whether, in light of the defendant's proffered reason and any newly disclosed facts, the plea may still be deemed voluntary and intelligent.\"  Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596 (citing United States v. Austin, 948 F.2d 783, 786-87 (1st Cir.1991), and United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1245-47 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laliberte maintains that he would not have voluntarily entered a guilty plea had he known that within a month of doing so the district court would proscribe his active cooperation with law enforcement agencies, and thereby vitiate his ability to earn a downward departure in his sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We think, however, that the denial of Laliberte's motion to withdraw his plea must now be reviewed in light of the Government's actual recommendations and the final judgment that was entered.  This court asks simply whether, given what finally happened, including the Government's favorable recommendations, the court's dismissal of the counts, and the reduced sentence, Laliberte's plea still appears to have been voluntary and intelligent.  For reasons already largely discussed above, see supra part II.B.1, the answer is clearly \"Yes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true the district court's May 6, 1992, order prevented Laliberte from continuing to assist government agencies during much of the period prior to sentencing.  Still, he rendered some assistance and, more to the point, that assistance sufficed for him to receive all the benefits--and more--promised to him in the Cooperation Agreement in return for his assistance.  In exchange for Laliberte's promise to plead guilty to Counts One and Five and to cooperate with government agencies, the Government, in the Cooperation Agreement, had agreed to \"move to dismiss Counts Two, Three and Four of the indictment after sentence [was] imposed.\"   The Government further said that it \"may petition the Court for the imposition of any lawful sentence,\" although the Cooperation Agreement expressly stated that \"[n]othing in this agreement shall be interpreted to require the United States to move the Court pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission Sentencing Guideline Section 5K1.1 for a downward departure.\"   Thus, Laliberte voluntarily pleaded guilty on April 27, 1992, with no assurances whatever, but only a bare hope, that he would receive a downward departure in his sentence.  Ultimately, the district court, pursuant to the Government's motions, not only dismissed Counts Two, Three and Four, but also, by downward departure, reduced Laliberte's prison term to sixty months from the guideline range of seventy-eight to ninety-seven months.  Accordingly, when viewed in light of all of these \"emergent circumstances\"--not just the district court's May 6, 1992, order--revealing that Laliberte received no less and, indeed, more than he had been promised if he pleaded guilty, we cannot say that Laliberte's guilty plea was rendered involuntary or unintelligent by subsequent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Counts Two through Four were, in fact, dismissed on the Government's motion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The order stated:</p>\n        <p>It having been brought to the attention of the Court that the Defendant herein, Carl Laliberte, has been engaged in active law enforcement cooperative activities at the instigation of BIDE and DEA officials ... without first seeking the consent of Defendant's supervising officer and the approval of the Court, and that such activity interferes with, disrupts, and defeats the Court's efforts, through its duly appointed officers, to properly supervise said Defendant while he is subject to the authority of the Court.</p>\n        <p>It is hereby, in consequence thereof, ORDERED that all active participation of Defendant Carl Laliberte in cooperative or other law enforcement activity CEASE, forthwith, pending further order of this Court.</p>\n        <p>(emphasis in original).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d) states in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>If a motion for withdrawal of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is made before sentence is imposed, imposition of sentence is suspended, or disposition is had under 18 U.S.C.

Secs. 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846 (1988) (Count One), possessing cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) (1988) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2 (1988) (Counts Two through Four), and using real property to commit violations of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 846 (1988) so that the property was subject to forfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. Sec. 853 (1988) (Count Five).  On April 27, 1992, Laliberte pleaded guilty to Counts One and Five pursuant to an Agreement To Plead Guilty And Cooperate (the \"Cooperation Agreement\") entered into with the United States Attorney for the District of Maine (the \"Government\") pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11.  On October 6, 1992, Laliberte, prior to sentencing, filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  The United States District Court for the District of Maine, on May 21, 1993, entered a memorandum of decision and order denying Laliberte's motion.  Laliberte appeals from this decision.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The April 27, 1992, Cooperation Agreement between Laliberte and the Government, in addition to requiring Laliberte to plead guilty to Counts One and Five, provided, inter alia, that Laliberte would</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>meet with attorneys and agents of the Government, as needed, to tell fully, honestly, truthfully and completely all that the defendant kn[ew] or ha[d] heard about violations of federal and state laws, including but not limited to the defendant's involvement and the involvement of others in violations of law....  The defendant agree[d] to provide the Government or aid the Government in acquiring all documents, photographs, bills, records, receipts and all like materials to which the defendant ha[d] access, which w[ould] corroborate this information.  Defendant further agree[d] to testify fully, honestly, truthfully and completely at any and all grand juries, trials or other official proceedings in which his testimony [was] requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laliberte also consented to \"assist the United States in effecting the forfeiture or other transfer of any property ... subject to forfeiture to the United States under any law of the United States.\"   In exchange for Laliberte's compliance with its terms and conditions, the Cooperation Agreement stated that the Government (1) \"may petition the Court for the imposition of any lawful sentence,\" see Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(B), and (2) \"will move to dismiss Counts Two, Three and Four of the indictment after sentence is imposed,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> see Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(A).  The Cooperation Agreement left to the sole judgment of the United States Attorney for the District of Maine whether Laliberte had complied with its terms and conditions--although the Government promised that, at Laliberte's request, it would \"make known the cooperation provided by defendant to any individual or entity to whom defendant wishe[d] such information disseminated.\"   A decision that Laliberte had not cooperated was to have \"a material and articulable basis.\"   Finally, the Cooperation Agreement expressly stated that \"[n]othing in this agreement shall be interpreted to require the United States to move the Court pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission Sentencing Guideline Section 5K1.1 for a downward departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laliberte maintains, and the record tends to confirm, that after the execution of the Cooperation Agreement he assisted the Bureau of Intergovernmental Drug Enforcement (the \"BIDE\") and the Drug Enforcement Agency (the \"DEA\") on at least one occasion.  His cooperation was in regard to the controlled purchase of six pounds of marijuana--a transaction that led to the arrest, on May 4, 1992, of an individual named Hank Dresser--the seizure of fifteen pounds of marijuana, and the criminal forfeiture of a residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laliberte's collaboration was, however, short-lived.  On May 5, 1992, James Hollywood, United States Pretrial/Probation Officer, complained to the district court by memorandum that his office had not been told that Laliberte was assisting government agents.  Hollywood asserted that it was improper for Laliberte to cooperate without the permission of the court and others, including the probation officer.  In response, the district court issued an order on May 6, 1992, directing the cessation of Laliberte's active law enforcement cooperation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About three months later, on August 10, 1992, the Government filed a motion requesting the district court to permit Laliberte to resume his active cooperation with law enforcement agencies.  This motion was allowed on August 15, 1992.  On September 30, 1992, however, it appears that the district court vacated its August 15, 1992, order, and reinstated its May 6, 1992, order which had proscribed Laliberte's active cooperation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly a week later, on October 6, 1992, Laliberte moved to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The motion asserted, inter alia, that, following the district court's May 6, 1992, order, Laliberte's counsel had asked the Government on May 8, June 17, and June 25 to take whatever action was necessary to have that order lifted.  Laliberte's motion further maintained that the Government had \"refused to take any action to have the order lifted, and [had] informed defense counsel of its position that the [district court] lack[ed] the authority to interfere with the active cooperation of a defendant with government agents, and that it would not seek the [district court's] permission to allow such active cooperation because to do so would acknowledge that authority.\"   In light of the Government's alleged \"failure to provide the information requested by the Probation Officer to consider consenting to the defendant's cooperation, and its failure to seek the approval of the [district court] to allow such cooperation,\" the withdrawal motion argued that Laliberte had been denied \"the opportunity to earn the filing of a motion for downward departure which the Government had promised him.\"   In this same vein, the final paragraph of the motion concluded:Since the Government would not have allowed the defendant to actively cooperate unless he agreed to plead guilty, and since the Government's representation to the defendant that he would be given the opportunity to earn a downward departure through such active cooperation was the most significant factor in the defendant's determination to plead guilty, the Government's failure to seek the consent of the Probation Officer and the approval of the [district court] in a timely manner to allow such active cooperation frustrated the very basis of the defendant's decision to enter into the plea agreement and to plead guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 1993, the district court denied Laliberte's motion, concluding that he had \"failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a 'fair and just' reason to withdraw his plea of guilty entered in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of the district court's having prohibited Laliberte from actively assisting in cooperative law enforcement activities, the Government, on June 15, 1993, moved both to dismiss Counts Two, Three and Four, and for a downward departure in his sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(e) (1988).  The Government declared that Laliberte had substantially assisted \"in the investigation and apprehension of others.\"   The district court granted the Government's motion, dismissing the three counts and reducing Laliberte's prison term to sixty months from the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range of seventy-eight to ninety-seven months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Laliberte was also sentenced to serve four years of supervised release and to forfeit his interest in real property in Auburn, Maine.  Judgment was entered on July 12, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Laliberte now contends that the district court abused its discretion when on May 21, 1993, it denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  In considering his argument, we consider the May 21, 1993, order in light of the subsequent sentencing actions, including the Government's request, accepted by the court, to dismiss the three counts and reduce the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision denying Laliberte's motion to withdraw his guilty plea is reviewed solely for abuse of discretion.

Laliberte argues that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because, by virtue of the district court's sua sponte order prohibiting him from actively assisting the BIDE and the DEA, he was denied the opportunity to perform his end of the Cooperation Agreement, or, as he says, he was compelled \"to breach the agreement he signed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the district court's prohibition operated so as to deny Laliberte the benefit of his bargain, that might indeed have been a plausible reason to allow him to renounce his plea.  But Laliberte mischaracterizes what actually happened.  Laliberte pled guilty on the basis of a so-called Cooperation Agreement, which burdened him with meeting with government agents, \"as needed,\" to tell all he knew about violations of law and providing testimony and other assistance, as requested.  If he did this, the Cooperation Agreement provided that the Government (1) \"may petition the Court for the imposition of any lawful sentence,\" and (2) would \"move to dismiss Counts Two, Three and Four of the indictment after sentence [was] imposed.\"   The U.S. Attorney was to be the sole judge of Laliberte's compliance, and promised to make known Laliberte's cooperation to anyone Laliberte requested.  The Cooperation Agreement flatly stated that nothing therein required the Government \"to move the Court pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission Sentencing Guideline Section 5K1.1 for a downward departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the Government ultimately moved to dismiss, and the district court dismissed, Counts Two, Three and Four of the indictment, thus giving to Laliberte the full benefit of its promise under (2).  The Government also complied with (1) by petitioning for \"a lawful sentence,\" and, in so doing, disregarded its right, elsewhere stated, not to seek a downward departure.  To Laliberte's benefit, the Government moved for, and the district court granted, a significant downward departure in Laliberte's sentence on the grounds of his substantial assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government's recommendations, incorporated in the district court's final judgment, accordingly gave Laliberte the full benefit of his bargain for dismissal of the three charges, and also gave Laliberte an additional, unpromised benefit (the downward departure) that the Cooperation Agreement had expressly stated the Government was not required to provide.  The stated premise of these benefits was that Laliberte had substantially assisted, thus performing his share of the bargain as to cooperating.  Whatever can be said had Laliberte been denied these benefits because of asserted non-cooperation, we can see no basis for his claim of having been denied the right to perform his share of the agreement where the Government acknowledged that he had met his obligations and accorded him everything promised in the event of his performance--with a sizable bonus (the downward departure) to boot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laliberte suggests that had he been allowed to cooperate for the entire time, he would, in some way not explained, been so extraordinarily helpful that the Government might have requested an even greater downward departure.  But as the Government pointed out at argument, what opportunities are extended to an informer to help catch others are necessarily always subject to the Government's control and veto.  The Cooperation Agreement, moreover, was devoid of any promise by the Government to allow Laliberte the right to engage in unlimited cooperation;  cooperation was rather a duty imposed on Laliberte as needed and requested--a duty which, if satisfied in the opinion of the U.S. Attorney, would result in the guaranteed dismissal of three counts and possibly, though only by implication, some unspecified recommendations for sentencing leniency.  Whatever promise of sentence reduction was implied, however, was offset by the Government's express disclaimer of any right to a downward departure.  Under the Cooperation Agreement as so written, Laliberte would doubtless have been entitled to complain had his chance to cooperate been so vitiated as to remove all possibility of earning the promised dismissal of the three counts, and possibly--although far less clearly--to earn some sentencing leniency.  But where, as here, his cooperation sufficed both to secure dismissal of the three counts and a discretionary downward departure, we see no plausibility in the claim that he was deprived of a fair and sufficient chance to fulfill his part of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

This principle obtains because, \"[w]hile an immediate change of heart may well lend considerable force to a plea withdrawal request, a long interval between the plea and the request often weakens any claim that the plea was entered in confusion or under false pretenses.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596485\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doyle,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/596485/united-states-v-clifford-a-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">595</span> </a></span>(citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Laliberte entered his guilty plea on April 27, 1992.  The district court's order prohibiting his active involvement with law enforcement agencies was filed just a little more than a week later on May 6, 1992.  Although the district court vacated that order on August 15, 1992, Laliberte contends that, by that time, he had lost all opportunity to cooperate because sentencing was then scheduled for September 21, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Accordingly, Laliberte moved the district court to withdraw his guilty plea on October 6, 1992--more than five months after he had entered it and five months to the day after the district court's May 6, 1992, order.  Laliberte attributes much of this five-month delay to time \"spent trying to resolve the problem\" created by the district court's order.  One can argue, however, that Laliberte's efforts to promote the efficacy of the Cooperation Agreement over several months after its execution make it less likely that he entered his guilty plea in \"confusion or under false pretenses.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596485\"><a href=\"/opinion/596485/united-states-v-clifford-a-doyle/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  But because </a></span>the timing issue is essentially immaterial to our outcome here, we see no need to resolve it.  Even assuming the motion was timely, it fails on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Claim of Innocence.   Courts look more favorably on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea when the motion is accompanied by an assertion of innocence.  E.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195328\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Parrilla-Tirado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195328/united-states-v-parrilla-tirado/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596485\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doyle,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/596485/united-states-v-clifford-a-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>.   Conversely, \"the absence of a claim of innocence weighs in favor of allowing a guilty plea to stand.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596485\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doyle,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/596485/united-states-v-clifford-a-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>;  e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195328\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Parrilla-Tirado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195328/united-states-v-parrilla-tirado/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>.   In this case, Laliberte concedes that he admitted his guilt at the Rule 11 proceeding.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 11.  Neither his motion to withdraw his guilty plea nor his appellate brief contains an assertion of innocence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  \"Thus, this factor cuts sharply against allowing [Laliberte's] motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195328\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Parrilla-Tirado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195328/united-states-v-parrilla-tirado/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.

This court asks simply whether, given what finally happened, including the Government's favorable recommendations, the court's dismissal of the counts, and the reduced sentence, Laliberte's plea still appears to have been voluntary and intelligent.  For reasons already largely discussed above, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span>part II.B.1, the answer is clearly \"Yes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true the district court's May 6, 1992, order prevented Laliberte from continuing to assist government agencies during much of the period prior to sentencing.  Still, he rendered some assistance and, more to the point, that assistance sufficed for him to receive all the benefits--and more--promised to him in the Cooperation Agreement in return for his assistance.  In exchange for Laliberte's promise to plead guilty to Counts One and Five and to cooperate with government agencies, the Government, in the Cooperation Agreement, had agreed to \"move to dismiss Counts Two, Three and Four of the indictment after sentence [was] imposed.\"   The Government further said that it \"may petition the Court for the imposition of any lawful sentence,\" although the Cooperation Agreement expressly stated that \"[n]othing in this agreement shall be interpreted to require the United States to move the Court pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission Sentencing Guideline Section 5K1.1 for a downward departure.\"   Thus, Laliberte voluntarily pleaded guilty on April 27, 1992, with no assurances whatever, but only a bare hope, that he would receive a downward departure in his sentence.  Ultimately, the district court, pursuant to the Government's motions, not only dismissed Counts Two, Three and Four, but also, by downward departure, reduced Laliberte's prison term to sixty months from the guideline range of seventy-eight to ninety-seven months.  Accordingly, when viewed in light of all of these \"emergent circumstances\"--not just the district court's May 6, 1992, order--revealing that Laliberte received no less and, indeed, more than he had been promised if he pleaded guilty, we cannot say that Laliberte's guilty plea was rendered involuntary or unintelligent by subsequent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Counts Two through Four were, in fact, dismissed on the Government's motion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The order stated:</p>\n        <p>It having been brought to the attention of the Court that the Defendant herein, Carl Laliberte, has been engaged in active law enforcement cooperative activities at the instigation of BIDE and DEA officials ... without first seeking the consent of Defendant's supervising officer and the approval of the Court, and that such activity interferes with, disrupts, and defeats the Court's efforts, through its duly appointed officers, to properly supervise said Defendant while he is subject to the authority of the Court.</p>\n        <p>It is hereby, in consequence thereof, ORDERED that all active participation of Defendant Carl Laliberte in cooperative or other law enforcement activity CEASE, forthwith, pending further order of this Court.</p>\n        <p>(emphasis in original).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d) states in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>If a motion for withdrawal of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is made before sentence is imposed, imposition of sentence is suspended, or disposition is had under 18 U.S.C.
