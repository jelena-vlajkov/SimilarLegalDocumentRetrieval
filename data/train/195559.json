Ann. tit. 36,    4541-4547 (West Supp.\n\n1993), imposes a tax on all packaged fluid milk sold in Maine\n\nirrespective  of the origin of the milk, but only Maine dairy\n\nfarmers  are eligible for what  amounts to a  rebate from the\n\nMaine Dairy Farm Stabilization Fund.  Cumberland Farms, which\n\nsells to Maine consumers  milk produced by out-of-state dairy\n\nfarmers, filed suit against various Maine officials, alleging\n\nthat  the tax-and-rebate scheme  violates the restrictions on\n\nstate power inherent  in the Commerce  Clause.  The  district\n\ncourt  denied Cumberland  Farms' motion for  summary judgment\n\nand  granted  that of  the  defendants,  using the  following\n\nreasoning as  the linchpin of its analysis:  \"It is true that\n\nthe  proceeds [of the  tax] are .  . . used  to benefit Maine\n\nmilk producers,  but current  precedents permit this  kind of\n\neconomic  protectionism.\"    See  Cumberland  Farms, Inc.  v.\n                                                         \n\nLaFaver, 834 F.
