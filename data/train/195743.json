He  denominated  a  state  correctional\n\nofficial, in his representative capacity, as the respondent.  The\n\ndistrict  court  discerned  a  Sixth  Amendment  violation:    it\n\nconcluded that Scarpa's trial counsel in the state court rendered\n\ngrossly ineffective  legal assistance  to him, see  Strickland v.\r                                                                        \n\nWashington,  466  U.S. 668,  687  (1984)  (elucidating applicable\r                    \n\ntest);  see also  Hill  v.  Lockhart,  474  U.S.  52,  57  (1985)\r                                              \n\n(applying Strickland  in the habeas context),  and that counsel's\r                              \n\nwoeful  performance  gave  rise  to   a  per  se  presumption  of\r                                                          \n\nprejudice.    The district  court  relied  principally on  dictum\n\ncontained  in United States v.  Cronic, 466 U.S.  648 (1984), for\r                                                \n\nthe  proposition that  it  did  not  need  to  inquire  into  the\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     1On appeal, petitioner has also appeared pro se, preparing a\r                                                              \nbrief and  arguing orally on his  own behalf.  To  assist him, we\nappointed counsel  who filed  a supplemental brief  and presented\nadditional oral argument.\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nexistence of actual prejudice.\n\n          Respondent  appeals.    Although  the  district court's\n\nreading of Cronic finds  some support in the case  law, including\r                           \n\nisolated  cases  decided by  the  Ninth and  Tenth  Circuits, see\r                                                                           \n\nUnited States v. Swanson, 943 F.2d 1070, 1073-74 (9th Cir. 1991);\r                                  \n\nOsborn  v. Shillinger,  861 F.2d  612, 626  (10th Cir.  1988), we\r                               \n\nbelieve that Cronic is not nearly so wide-ranging as the district\r                             \n\ncourt assumed.  Hence, we reverse.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          We  glean the  essential facts  from the  transcript of\n\npetitioner's  trial in Suffolk Superior Court.  On June 10, 1987,\n\nJoseph  Desmond,  an  agent   of  the  federal  Drug  Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA), posing as a would-be cocaine purchaser, met\n\nwith  his initial  target,  Robert Ricupero,  at  a pub  in  East\n\nBoston.  At Ricupero's request, petitioner joined them.  The trio\n\ndiscussed a possible cocaine purchase and then crossed the street\n\nto  a parked limousine that bore  the insignia of the \"Snow White\n\nLimousine Service.\"  Ricupero and Scarpa entered the vehicle.  As\n\nDesmond  later  testified,  Scarpa  passed roughly  28  grams  of\n\ncocaine to Ricupero,  who handed  it to Desmond  in exchange  for\n\n$1500  in cash.   Ricupero  kept $100  and gave the  remainder to\n\nScarpa.  These events occurred under police surveillance.\n\n          The  next  encounter  between   Desmond  and  his  prey\n\noccurred   on  July  18,  1987.    In  preparation  for  it,  the\n\nauthorities again assigned a cadre of law enforcement officers to\n\nsurveillance duties.  Desmond  and Ricupero met at the  same pub.\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nAt Ricupero's  invitation, Scarpa  again  joined them.   On  this\n\noccasion, the actual exchange  occurred in the deserted stairwell\n\nof a nearby apartment building, and a fourth man, James Marcella,\n\nentered  the equation.  Desmond  testified that Marcella handed a\n\npackage  containing roughly 55  grams of  cocaine to  Scarpa, who\n\npassed the package to  Ricupero.  When Ricupero placed  the drugs\n\nwithin  Desmond's  reach, Desmond  handed  him  $3000.   Ricupero\n\nslipped the money to Scarpa, who turned it over to Marcella.\n\n          In due season, the Commonwealth indicted petitioner for\n\ndrug trafficking and unlawful distribution.  A jury convicted him\n\non all charges after a four-day trial.  The trial judge sentenced\n\nhim to serve a  lengthy prison term.   Petitioner's motion for  a\n\nnew trial  failed; the  Massachusetts Appeals Court  affirmed the\n\nconviction, see Commonwealth v. Scarpa,  30 Mass. App. Ct.  1106,\r                                                \n\n567 N.E.2d  1268 (1991) (table);  and the Supreme  Judicial Court\n\n(SJC)  summarily denied  petitioner's  application  for leave  to\n\nobtain  further  appellate review  (alofar), see  Commonwealth v.\r                                                                        \n\nScarpa, 409 Mass. 1105, 571 N.E.2d 28 (1991).\r                \n\n          Undaunted, Scarpa  filed an  application for a  writ of\n\nhabeas corpus in federal district court.  After hearing arguments\n\npresented  by Scarpa and by the  Commonwealth, the district court\n\ngranted  the   petition.     It  found  that   defense  counsel's\n\nperformance  not  only  fell   below  an  objectively  reasonable\n\nstandard  of  proficiency  but also  caused  a  breakdown  in the\n\nadversarial  system.      This,  the   district  judge   thought,\n\nconstituted  prejudice  per  se.   Accordingly,  he  vacated  the\r                                         \n\n                                5\r\r\n\nconviction, ordered  petitioner released from state  custody, and\n\ndirected  the Commonwealth  to retry  him if  it sought  to exact\n\nfurther punishment.   The court refused respondent's  application\n\nfor a stay, and petitioner is at liberty.\n\nII.  EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES\r          II.  EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES\n\n          The Commonwealth is the real party in interest in these\n\nproceedings, and  we treat  the  case as  if  it were  the  named\n\nrespondent.   At the  outset, the Commonwealth  seeks to sidestep\n\nhabeas relief by convincing us  that petitioner failed to present\n\nhis  constitutional claim to the state courts before bolting to a\n\nfederal forum.  We are not persuaded.\n\n                    A.  Governing Principles.\r                              A.  Governing Principles.\r                                                      \n\n          Under our  federal system,  both the federal  and state\n\ncourts  are  entrusted  with  the  protection  of  constitutional\n\nrights.  See Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 251 (1886).  In order\r                                      \n\nto  ease  potential  friction  between these  two  sovereigns,  a\n\nfederal  court will ordinarily  defer action on  a cause properly\n\nwithin  its jurisdiction  until the  courts of  another sovereign\n\nwith concurrent powers, already cognizant of the litigation, have\n\nhad an opportunity to pass  upon the matter.  See Rose  v. Lundy,\r                                                                          \n\n455  U.S. 509, 518 (1982).  This practice, reflecting concerns of\n\ncomity,  has been codified in 28 U.S.C.   2254,2 and memorialized\n                    \r                              \n\n     2The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n                       *        *        *\n\n               (b) An application for  a writ of habeas\n          corpus  in  behalf  of  a  person  in custody\n          pursuant  to the  judgment of  a State  court\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nin our case law,  see, e.g., Mele  v. Fitchburg Dist. Court,  850\r                                                                     \n\nF.2d 817, 819 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          In order to present a federal claim to the state courts\n\nin  a  manner  sufficient   to  satisfy  exhaustion  concerns,  a\n\npetitioner  must inform the state  court of both  the factual and\n\nlegal underpinnings of the claim.  See Picard v. Conner, 404 U.S.\r                                                                 \n\n270, 276-78  (1971).   The test  is substantive:   was the  claim\n\npresented in  such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable\n\njurist  would have been alerted  to the existence  of the federal\n\nquestion?  See  Nadworny v. Fair, 872  F.2d 1093, 1101  (1st Cir.\r                                          \n\n1989).   While the answer  to the  question must not  be made  to\n\ndepend on  \"ritualistic formality,\" id.  at 1097, neither  is the\r                                                 \n\nanswer wholly in the eye of the beholder.\n\n          In  Gagne v. Fair,  835 F.2d 6,  7 (1st  Cir. 1987), we\r                                     \n\ncatalogued four ways in which the requirement of fair presentment\n\nmay  be  fulfilled:   \"1)  citing  a  specific  provision of  the\n\nConstitution;   2)   presenting  the   substance  of   a  federal\n\n                    \r                              \n\n          shall not  be granted unless  it appears that\n          the  applicant  has  exhausted  the  remedies\n          available in the courts of the State, or that\n          there is either an absence of available State\n          corrective  process  or   the  existence   of\n          circumstances    rendering    such    process\n          ineffective  to protect  the  rights  of  the\n          prisoner.\n               (c) An applicant shall  not be deemed to\n          have  exhausted the remedies available in the\n          courts of the  State, within  the meaning  of\n          this section,  if he has the  right under the\n          law of  the State to raise,  by any available\n          procedure, the question presented.\n\n28 U.S.C.   2254(b), (c) (1988).\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nconstitutional claim in  such manner that  it likely alerted  the\n\nstate court to the claim's federal nature; 3) reliance on federal\n\nconstitutional  precedents;  and 4)  claiming a  particular right\n\nspecifically  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution.\"   We  did  not,\n\nhowever, attribute exclusivity to  this compendium.  In Nadworny,\r                                                                          \n\n872 F.2d  at 1099-1100, we mentioned a fifth possibility, namely,\n\nthe assertion of a state law claim that is functionally identical\n\nto a federal  claim.  These possibilities recognize  that certain\n\nconstitutional violations have the capacity  to rest on a variety\n\nof factual bases.  While the facts and legal theories need not be\n\npropounded  in  precisely  the  same  terms,   fair  presentation\n\nrequires that  the constitutional analysis  necessary to  resolve\n\nthe ultimate question  posed in  the habeas petition  and in  the\n\nstate court proceedings, respectively, be substantially the same.\n\nSee Lanigan v. Maloney, 853 F.2d 40, 44-45 (1st Cir. 1988), cert.\r                                                                           \n\ndenied, 488 U.S. 1007 (1989).\r                \n\n                          B.

Analysis.\r                                                \n\n          Here,  petitioner's  odyssey through  the Massachusetts\n\ncourt system involved a trial, a motion for a new  trial, a full-\n\ndress appeal in the state  appeals court, and an alofar.   At all\n\nthree post-trial stages, petitioner raised claims anent counsel's\n\nproficiency   (or,  more   precisely  put,   counsel's  lack   of\n\nproficiency) and couched his claim in terms that remained largely\n\nunchanged.  In his  pleadings and memoranda at all  three stages,\n\npetitioner  alleged three  principal  shortcomings  on  counsel's\n\npart:   a  failure to  attack the  prosecution's star  witness; a\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nmindless solicitation  to the jury to believe  that star witness;\n\nand the ill-advised pursuit of a defense, not legally cognizable,\n\nthat  virtually conceded  the elements  of the  charged offenses.\n\nThroughout the appellate process, petitioner described  his claim\n\nas \"ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n\n          Moreover, at  the first two stages he cited three state\n\ncases,  Commonwealth  v.

Saferian, 315 N.E.2d 878 (Mass. 1974), that dealt\r                                  \n\nsquarely  with this  issue.3    In  his  motion  for  new  trial,\n\npetitioner cited  the Sixth  Amendment by name,  accompanying the\n\nmotion  with the affidavit of his  trial counsel, Arthur Tacelli,\n\nattesting  to Tacelli's self-professed ineffectiveness.  Scarpa's\n\nfederal habeas petition again asserted \"ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel,\"  and cited the same  three factual bases  in support of\n\nthe assertion.\n\n          On these facts,  we agree with the district  judge that\n\nthe  arguments presented by  petitioner sufficiently  alerted the\n\nstate  courts to the substance  of the constitutional  claim.  In\n\nthe first  place, an argument phrased  as \"ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel\" certainly \"claim[s]  a particular right  specifically\n                    \r                              \n\n     3The Commonwealth  makes much of  the fact that  these cases\nwere not  cited in the alofar, and insists that Mele, 850 F.2d at\r                                                              \n823, requires a federal court to restrict the exhaustion  inquiry\nto that document.  This crabbed reading of Mele wrenches the case\r                                                         \nout  of   its  context.     There,   the  defendant   raised  his\nconstitutional  issue  before the  intermediate  appellate court,\nabandoned it  in his alofar, and then  attempted to raise it anew\nin his  habeas petition.  See id. at 818-19.  In contrast, Scarpa\r                                           \nhas consistently asserted his ineffective assistance claim.\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nguaranteed  by the Constitution.\"  Gagne, 835  F.2d at 7.  In the\r                                                  \n\nsecond place,  by identifying the  Sixth Amendment in  his motion\n\nfor  a new trial, petitioner \"cite[s] a specific provision of the\n\nConstitution,\" id., and,  at the same  time, provided a  backdrop\r                            \n\nagainst which his later filings had to be viewed.\n\n          If  any doubt  remains, the  sockdolager is that,  as a\n\ngeneral rule,  presenting a state-law claim  that is functionally\n\nidentical  to a  federal-law  claim suffices  to effectuate  fair\n\npresentment of the latter claim.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1099-\r                                                        \n\n1100.   So  it is  here:   petitioner brought himself  within the\n\nencincture of this rule  by his repeated citation to the  trio of\n\nMassachusetts cases that we have mentioned   cases  that evaluate\n\nthe   effectiveness  of   an  attorney's  performance   in  terms\n\nreminiscent  of  the  federal  constitutional standard.    As  in\n\nStrickland, 466  U.S. 668,  the Massachusetts  cases  call for  a\r                    \n\ndeferential  evaluation of  counsel's  performance,  and, if  the\n\nperformance is found  to be substandard, an inquiry  into whether\n\ncounsel's  incompetence  injured   the  defendant's   substantial\n\nrights.  See Pope, 467 N.E.2d at 122-123; Satterfield, 364 N.E.2d\r                                                               \n\nat 1264; Saferian, 315 N.E.2d at 882-83.4\r                           \n                    \r                              \n\n     4The  SJC  has  made  clear  that  it  ordinarily  considers\nquestions involving \"assistance of counsel\" as coming \"within the\r                                                                           \nmeaning of the  Sixth Amendment.\"   Saferian, 315  N.E.2d at  882\r                                                      \n(emphasis supplied).  A defendant must show that\n\n          there   has    been   serious   incompetency,\n          inefficiency,  or  inattention  of counsel   \n          behavior of counsel falling  measurably below\n          that which might be expected from an ordinary\n          fallible  lawyer    and,  if that  is  found,\n          then,  typically,  whether   it  has   likely\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n          Despite  minor  differences  in  phraseology,  the  two\n\nstandards   state and federal   strike us as equivalent.  Indeed,\n\nthe Commonwealth  does not contend  that a  claim of  ineffective\n\nassistance of  counsel  arising under  Massachusetts law  differs\n\nfrom such a claim arising out of the Sixth Amendment.  We readily\n\nappreciate why this  contention is  not voiced.   The essence  of\n\neach inquiry looks to the likelihood that effective assistance of\n\ncounsel would have produced  a different trial outcome.   The SJC\n\nitself, while leaving open the theoretical possibility that there\n\nmight be some difference between the state and federal standards,\n\nhas  concluded that  if  their state's  test  is satisfied,  \"the\n\nFederal test  is  necessarily  met  as well.\"    Commonwealth  v.\r                                                                       \n\nFuller,  475 N.E.2d 381, 385 n.3 (Mass.  1985).  Finally, we deem\r                \n\nit  highly relevant  that  the SJC  has  continued to  apply  the\n\nSaferian analysis to ineffective  assistance of counsel claims in\r                  \n\nthe post-Strickland era.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Charles, 489\r                                                                      \n\n                    \r                              \n\n          deprived  the  defendant   of  an   otherwise\n          available, substantial ground of defence.\n\nId.  at 883.    This is  functionally  identical to  the  federal\r             \nstandard, which calls for a defendant to show\n\n          that  counsel's  performance  was  deficient.\n          This  requires  showing  that   counsel  made\n          errors   so  serious  that  counsel  was  not\n          functioning as the  \"counsel\" guaranteed  the\n          defendant  by the  Sixth Amendment.   Second,\n          the  defendant must  show that  the deficient\n          performance  prejudiced  the  defense.   This\n          requires showing that  counsel's errors  were\n          so serious  as to deprive the  defendant of a\n          fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687.\r                    \n\n                                11\r\r\n\nN.E.2d 679, 688 (Mass. 1986); Commonwealth v.

In our  view, however,  this  omission is  not fatal.\n\nAlthough such citation is  strongly recommended if only to  avoid\n\ncontroversies of  this nature,  we have specifically  declined to\n\nadopt a  bright-line rule.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1101 &amp; n.4.\r                                                  \n\nThe guidelines we  have promulgated in respect  to exhaustion are\n\nintended to  be instructive,  rather  than to  comprise the  sole\n\ncorridors  through   which   the  \"actual   embodiment  of   fair\n\npresentation\" may pass.

See Strickland, 466\r                                                                      \n\nU.S.  at  687.    The   touchstone  for  determining  whether  an\n\nattorney's  performance  falls below  the constitutional  norm is\n\nwhether  counsel has brought \"to bear such skill and knowledge as\n\nwill render  the trial  a reliable adversarial  testing process.\"\n\nId. at 688.  The inquiry has  two foci.  First, a reviewing court\r             \n\nmust  assess  the  proficiency  of  counsel's  performance  under\n\nprevailing professional norms.  See United States v. Natanel, 938\r                                                                      \n\nF.2d  302, 310  (1st Cir.  1991), cert.  denied, 112  S.

This  evaluation  demands a  fairly tolerant  approach;\n\nafter all,  the Constitution pledges  to an accused  an effective\n\ndefense,  not  necessarily  a  perfect defense  or  a  successful\n\ndefense.   See, e.g., Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 51 (1st\r                                                     \n\nCir. 1993); Natanel,  938 F.2d at 309.  And, moreover, since even\r                             \n\nthe  most celebrated lawyers can  differ over trial  tactics in a\n\nparticular  case,  a  reviewing  court  must  \"indulge  a  strong\n\npresumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of\n\nreasonable professional  assistance.\"   Strickland,  466 U.S.  at\r                                                            \n\n689.\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n          The  second  line  of  inquiry is  needed  because,  in\n\nitself,  dreary  lawyering  does  not  offend  the  Constitution.\n\nRather, a  finding that counsel  failed to  meet the  performance\n\nstandard merely  serves to  advance the  focus of the  Strickland\r                                                                           \n\ninquiry to the question of whether the accused suffered prejudice\n\nin consequence  of counsel's blunders.

A defendant who alleges\r                                          \n\nineffective  assistance  of  counsel  must carry  the  devoir  of\n\npersuasion  on both  tiers of  the Strickland  test.

The same holds true of a habeas petitioner\r              \n\nwho  claims that counsel mishandled his case in the state courts.\n\nSee Perron v.

Tortora,\r                                                                          \n922 F.2d at  883 (explaining that  lesser deference is  warranted\nwhen  district court  essays no  \"new or  different factfinding,\"\nbut,  instead, acts on the  basis of a  magistrate's findings and\nreport).\n\n                                15\r\r\n\ndrugs to  Desmond; that, with respect to  the second transaction,\n\n(1)  Scarpa was a middle link in the chain of drugs and cash, and\n\n(2) Desmond  did  not  know  whether Scarpa  received  any  money\n\nreferable  to that  transaction.   Attorney  Tacelli declined  to\n\nquestion Mugnano  and produced no witnesses  in Scarpa's defense.\n\nHis closing  argument consisted  of a  terse  explanation of  the\n\nconcept of reasonable  doubt and  a solicitation to  the jury  to\n\naccept the government's testimony:\n\n          So, I'm  asking you,  as finders of  fact, to\n          believe   Detective   Mugnano,  because   his\n          testimony,  I suggest,  is  innocuous.    The\n          second witness  that the Government   and the\n          prime witness that the Government produced in\n          support of their argument that Mr. Scarpa was\n          guilty    of    cocaine    trafficking    and\n          distribution, was  Agent Desmond  . . .   And\n          you  listen to  DEA Agent    Drug Enforcement\n          Agent Desmond.   And I ask you:   What motive\n          would that  man have to come  into a superior\n          court   courtroom,  with  a  varied  jury,  a\n          superior  court judge,  what motive  would he\n          have for lying?  What motive would he have to\n          tell an  untruth?  What motive  would he have\n          to  color the fact situation as he remembered\n          it?   And I suggest  to you   and  I hope you\r                                                                 \n          find resoundingly   that he has no motive but\r                                                                 \n          that of  following the  truth. .  . .

Was  he a  dupe?\n          What happened  to that  money?  What  was its\n          final  destination?    Is  Scarpa  a  user of\n          drugs?  Is Scarpa  someone that Ricupero, the\n          target of the investigation   is Scarpa   was\n          he used  by Ricupero to shield himself? . . .\n          And  I'm suggesting  to you    again,  at the\n          expense of being  repetitious, Scarpa is  not\n          found   and it is undetermined   that  is the\n          word that  Agent Desmond  used on July  8th  \n          it's undetermined  if Scarpa had any  of that\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n          money.  . . .  And clearly, the source of the\n          cocaine on the 8th  was not Scarpa.  At  best\r                                                                 \n          he  was a  conduit; someone  through whom  it\r                                                                 \n          passed,  and  through whom  the  money passed\r                                                                 \n          [emphasis supplied].\n\n          During  summation, the  prosecutor agreed  that Desmond\n\nhad no reason to lie.  He told the jury that the Commonwealth had\n\nno obligation  to prove either  the source of the  cocaine or the\n\nultimate  destination  of the  money.   And  he  labelled defense\n\ncounsel's closing argument \"a smokescreen.\"\n\n          In due  course, the  judge instructed  the jury  on the\n\nelements  of the  trafficking offense.   He  told the  jurors, in\n\nsubstance, that to convict, they must find that the defendant (1)\n\nknowingly  (2)   possessed  cocaine;  (3)  with   the  intent  to\n\ndistribute it; and (4)  that the quantity of  cocaine must be  in\n\nexcess  of  28 grams.   See  Mass. Gen.  Laws  ch. 94C,    32E(b)\r                                     \n\n(1992).   The judge instructed the jurors to much the same effect\n\nin   regard  to   the   distribution   charge,  but   substituted\n\ndistribution  for possession  and eliminated  any reference  to a\n\nminimum quantity of  cocaine.  See id.   32A(a).   The judge also\r                                                \n\ninformed the jury that the identity of \"the kingpin\" did not bear\n\nupon  the charges  at hand.   The jury  convicted Scarpa  on both\n\ncounts.\n\n                 C.  The Attorney's Performance.\r                           C.

Believing  that  this   approach  effectively\n\nconceded the  only disputed  elements of the  charged crimes  and\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nrelieved  the prosecution of its burden of proof, the court found\n\nAttorney Tacelli's use of it  to be objectively unreasonable, and\n\ntherefore, substandard.\n\n          We uphold this  finding.  At the least, defense counsel\n\nin a criminal case should understand the elements of the offenses\n\nwith  which  his  client  is  charged  and  should  display  some\n\nappreciation of the  recognized defenses thereto.   See Young  v.\r                                                                       \n\nZant, 677 F.2d 792, 798 (11th Cir. 1982) (explaining that defense\r              \n\ncounsel falls below performance standard by failing to understand\n\nhis client's factual  claims or the  legal significance of  those\n\nclaims);  Baty v. Balkcom, 661  F.2d 391, 394-95  (5th Cir. 1981)\r                                   \n\n(holding that  defense counsel's unfamiliarity  with his client's\n\ncase transgressed performance  standard), cert. denied,  456 U.S.\r                                                                \n\n1011 (1982).  Unless counsel brings these rudiments to the table,\n\na defendant likely  will be  deprived of a  fair \"opportunity  to\n\nmeet  the case of the  prosecution,\" Strickland, 466  U.S. at 685\r                                                         \n\n(quoting Adams v.

Phrased another way,\n\nif an attorney does not  grasp the basics of the charges  and the\n\npotential  defenses to them, an  accused may well  be stripped of\n\nthe very means  that are essential  to subject the  prosecution's\n\ncase to adversarial testing.  See id. at 688.\r                                               \n\n          We  agree with the district  court that this  is such a\n\ncase.    Defense  counsel's  pursuit  of  his  half-baked  theory\n\nevidenced  a  blatant  misunderstanding  of  the  charged crimes.\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nBeing  a \"conduit\"  denotes acting as  an agent  or intermediary.\n\nPersons  who  knowingly  serve  as agents  or  intermediaries  in\n\nnarcotics  transactions   are  punishable  as   principals  under\n\nMassachusetts law.   See Commonwealth v. Murillo, 589 N.E.2d 340,\r                                                          \n\n342 (Mass.), rev. denied, 575 N.E.2d 326  (1992); Commonwealth v.\r                                                                        \n\nPoole,  563 N.E.2d  253,  255 (Mass.  1990).   Thus, the  line of\r               \n\ndefense  that  counsel  selected  was  altogether  irrelevant  to\n\npetitioner's guilt  or innocence;  and, to compound  the problem,\n\nthe steps  taken in pursuit  of it   such  as urging the  jury to\n\naccept Desmond's testimony   played into the prosecution's hands.\n\nSerious  errors  in  an  attorney's  performance,   unrelated  to\n\ntactical choices  or to some plausible  strategic aim, constitute\n\nsubstandard  performance.  See United  States v. Weston, 708 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n302, 306 (7th Cir.)

This verity  has particular  force\n\nwhere, as here, counsel's  blunders not only failed to  assist in\n\nfashioning a  defense but also cemented  the prosecution's theory\n\nof the  case.  There are times when even the most adroit advocate\n\n                                19\r\r\n\ncannot  extricate a  criminal  defendant  from  a pit;  but  when\n\ncounsel,  to no  apparent end,  digs the  hole deeper,  the Sixth\n\nAmendment performance standard is likely implicated.\n\n          The  Commonwealth's  rejoinder  is  lame.    First,  it\n\ncontends   that   Attorney   Tacelli  rendered   constitutionally\n\neffective  assistance because  the conduit  defense is  a \"common\n\ndefense which raises issues  considered good strategy.\"   This is\n\nno more  than an  ipse dixit,  unsupported by  authority.   To be\r                                      \n\nsure,  the   Commonwealth  cites   a  quadrat   of  cases   in  a\n\nconspicuously  unsuccessful effort  to bolster  this claim    but\n\nnone of  them is persuasive  on the  point.  Two  of these  cases\n\nstand for  the unremarkable  proposition that \"mere  presence\" is\n\nnot enough  to convict  in a  narcotics case,  in the absence  of\n\nother  evidence.  See Commonwealth  v. Cruz, 614  N.E.2d 702, 704\r                                                     \n\n(Mass. 1993); Commonwealth v.

In  that  case,  the  defendant  was  charged  in  a\ncomplicated check-kiting  scheme.  The government  had spent over\nfour  years  investigating the  case,  but  when the  defendant's\ncounsel withdrew, the trial  court appointed a young real  estate\nlawyer only  25 days before trial.   The Supreme Court  held that\nthis brief period for preparation was \"not so  short that it even\narguably justifies a presumption that no lawyer could provide the\n[defendant] with the effective  assistance of counsel required by\nthe Constitution.\"  466 U.S. at 665.\n\n                                22\r\r\n\ndefense counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest, see\r                                                                           \n\nCuyler v.

See  Swanson, 943  F.2d  at 1074  (holding that\r                                        \n\nknowingly and  explicitly conceding  reasonable doubt  in closing\n\nargument  is per  se  prejudicial); Osborn,  861  F.2d at  628-29\r                                                    \n\n(finding per  se  prejudice when  defense  counsel  intentionally\r                          \n\nstressed the brutality  of his client's crime, admitted  that the\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nevidence against his client was overwhelming, and made statements\n\nto  the press  that his  client had  no evidence  to  support his\n\nclaims).   We believe that these  cases misperceive the rationale\n\nunderlying the  Cronic  exception.   In  our  view,  the  Court's\r                                \n\nlanguage  in Cronic was  driven by  the recognition  that certain\r                             \n\ntypes  of  conduct  are in  general  so  antithetic  to effective\r                                             \n\nassistance   for  example, lawyers  who leave  the courtroom  for\n\nlong  stretches of time during  trial are unlikely  to be stellar\n\nadvocates  in any matter   that a case-by-case analysis simply is\n\nnot worth the  cost of protracted litigation.  No matter what the\n\nfacts of  a given case may  be, this sort of  conduct will almost\n\nalways result in prejudice.  See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658-59.  But\r                                                 \n\nattorney errors particular to the facts of an individual case are\n\nqualitatively different.   Virtually  by definition, such  errors\n\n\"cannot  be   classified  according  to  likelihood   of  causing\n\nprejudice\"  or  \"defined  with  sufficient  precision  to  inform\n\ndefense  attorneys  correctly   just  what  conduct  to   avoid.\"\n\nStrickland,  466  U.S.  at  693.   Consequently,  the  Court  has\r                    \n\ndeclined to accord presumptively prejudicial status to them.  See\r                                                                           \n\nid.\r             \n\n          We are  not alone in  our attempt  to harmonize  Cronic\r                                                                           \n\nwith  Strickland by  drawing  an easily  visible line  separating\r                          \n\nthose few cases in which prejudice may be presumed from the mine-\n\nrun (in which actual  prejudice must be shown).   When confronted\n\nby  particular  errors  on  the  part of  defense  counsel,  best\n\nevaluated  in the context of the defendant's trial, other federal\n\n                                24\r\r\n\ncourts  have refused  to  march  under  the Cronic  banner,  and,\r                                                            \n\ninstead,  notwithstanding the  seriousness  of  the errors,  have\n\nperformed both parts of the requisite Strickland analysis.

Our reasons are manifold, but four of them are paramount.\n\n          First,  we do not think that the Court intended such an\n\nexpansion to  occur.  Second, once it is necessary to examine the\n\ntrial record  in order  to evaluate counsel's  particular errors,\n\nresort to a per se presumption is no longer justified by the wish\r                            \n\nto avoid the cost of case-by-case litigation.  An overly generous\n\nreading of Cronic would do  little more than replace case-by-case\r                           \n\nlitigation  over  prejudice  with  case-by-case  litigation  over\n\nprejudice per se.\r                          \n\n          Third,  in  our judgment  the  proper  approach to  the\n\nintended  reach  of  the   Cronic  dictum  is  informed  by   the\r                                           \n\nrefinements of the harmless-error doctrine contained in a battery\n\nof  recent  Supreme Court  cases.    Some constitutional  errors,\n\ndenominated  \"trial errors,\"  will not  result in  reversal of  a\n\nconviction  if they  are shown  to be  harmless.   See Brecht  v.\r                                                                       \n                    \r                              \n\n          The counterpoint, however, is that  in deciding whether\nto require a showing of prejudice for inadequate legal assistance\non appeal,  courts have traced  a line,  analogous to the  one we\ndraw  today,  distinguishing  between inept  performance  and  no\nperformance.

However,  other more fundamental errors, denominated\n\n\"structural  errors,\"  jar  the  framework  in  which  the  trial\n\nproceeds  and,  accordingly,  are   said  to  \"defy  analysis  by\n\n`harmless-error' standards,\" Brecht, 113  S.

In effect,  then, the harmfulness  of structural\r                        \n\nerrors  can be  conclusively  presumed.

Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 307-08.\r                                   \n\n          We  are confident  that  what transpired  in this  case\n\nbears  a  much  stronger  resemblance  to  trial  error  than  to\n\nstructural error.   Like  the line separating  trial errors  from\n\nstructural errors, the line past which prejudice will be presumed\n\nin cases  involving claims of ineffective assistance  ought to be\n\nplotted to exclude cases in  which a detailed contextual analysis\n\nis required.  Drawing the line in this way is especially fitting,\n\nwe   suggest,  because  like  the  harmless-error  doctrine,  the\n\nprejudice prong of Strickland helps to promote the salutary tenet\r                                       \n\nthat  \"the central purpose of  a criminal trial  is to decide the\n\nfactual  question  of the  defendant's  guilt  or innocence,  and\n\npromote[]  public respect for the criminal process by focusing on\n\nthe underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually\n\ninevitable  presence  of  immaterial  error.\"   Delaware  v.  Van\r                                                                           \n\nArsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 681 (1986) (citation omitted).\r                 \n\n          Our  fourth  and final  reason  for  taking a  somewhat\n\nnarrow  view of  the  Cronic dictum  is  closely related  to  the\r                                      \n\nconcerns  that  the Court  has  expressed  in the  harmless-error\n\ncases.   In addition to comity and federalism concerns, the state\n\nhas  an important interest in  the finality of  its jury verdicts\n\nand in keeping behind  bars criminals who have been  fairly tried\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nand justly convicted.   Forcing  a state to  retry its  criminals\n\nimposes  social  costs, including  the  expenditure  of time  and\n\nresources  for all concerned; the dispersal  of witnesses and the\n\nerosion  of witnesses'  memories;  and the  occurrence of  sundry\n\nother events that make obtaining  a conviction more difficult  on\n\nretrial.  See Brecht, 113 S. Ct. at 1720-21; cf. Barker v. Wingo,\r                                                                          \n\n407 U.S. 514, 522 n.16 (1972) (admonishing that the public has an\n\n\"interest in trying people accused of crime, rather than granting\n\nthem immunization  because of  legal error\")  (citation omitted).\n\nFor this reason, federal  courts should not rush to  overturn the\n\nstate-court  conviction of a  defendant who, although represented\n\nby mistake-prone counsel,  is unable to show how  (if at all) the\n\nlawyer's  bevues undermined  the fairness  or reliability  of the\n\ntrial's result.8\n                    \r                              \n\n     8At any  rate, this is  not the  case in which  to push  the\nenvelope.   Even  if one  were to  accept the  expansive view  of\nCronic exemplified  by Swanson, 943  F.2d 1070,  the record  here\r                                        \nsimply  does not  justify  a finding  of  a complete  failure  to\nsubject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.\nIndeed, in  the  unpublished rescript  accompanying  its  summary\naffirmance  of  Scarpa's  conviction,  the  Massachusetts Appeals\nCourt  did  not  even  find  Attorney  Tacelli's  conduct  to  be\n\"manifestly unreasonable.\"  See Commonwealth v. Scarpa, No. 90-P-\r                                                                \n694,  at 2  (Mass. App.  Ct.  Mar. 7,  1991).   While  we do  not\nnecessarily agree with this evaluation, see supra Part III(C), we\r                                                           \nrecognize that whatever his  failings, Attorney Tacelli strove to\nimpress  the jury with  the gravity of  the prosecution's burden.\nFor  example, he focused in  his summation on  \"the obligation of\nthe  Government to  prove their  [sic] case  beyond a  reasonable\ndoubt\"; reminded the jurors that, in deciding the case, they must\n\"have  an  abiding conviction\";  and  told them  that  they could\n\"choose to believe everything a witness says, disbelieve it, [or]\nbelieve  half of  it.\"   Although Attorney  Tacelli weakened  his\npresentation  by his later remarks, quoted ante, he still left it\r                                                         \nup to the jury to decide the ultimate question of Scarpa's guilt.\nHence,  we do not find  in this record  such a deliberate rolling\nover as might warrant a finding  of an absolute breakdown of  the\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n          To   summarize,  we   hold  that   Strickland  controls\r                                                                 \n\ninquiries concerning  counsel's actual performance at  trial, and\n\nthat  substandard  performance,  in  the   nature  of  particular\n\nattorney  errors, cannot  conclusively be  presumed to  have been\n\nprejudicial.   Silhouetted against this backdrop,  we consider it\n\nsupremely  important that  Attorney Tacelli's blunders  cannot be\n\njudged  solely   by  the   \"surrounding  circumstances\"  of   the\n\nrepresentation, but, rather, must be judged in light of the whole\n\nrecord, including  the facts of  the case, the  trial transcript,\n\nthe exhibits, and  the applicable substantive  law.  We  conclude\n\nthat this characterization places the case beyond Cronic's reach.\r                                                                  \n\nPut  bluntly,  because  Attorney  Tacelli's errors  are  more  an\n\nexample  of  maladroit   performance  than  of   non-performance,\n\nStrickland necessitates  an inquiry into the  existence of actual\r                    \n\nprejudice.\n\n                                2.\r                                          2.\n\n          Since the district court presumed prejudice, it made no\n\nexplicit findings on the second prong of the Strickland test.  We\r                                                                 \n\nhave considered  the advisability of remanding  for this purpose,\n\nbut we conclude that it is unnecessary to do so.  The  origins of\n\nthe case date back to 1987;  the parties have briefed and  argued\n\nthe  issue of actual prejudice;  and the record  is sufficient to\n\npermit  us to perform the decisionmaking task.  Moreover, all the\n\nevidence was taken in the state courts; thus, we are in as good a\n\nposition as the federal district judge to probe the matter.  And,\n                    \r                              \n\nadversarial process.\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nfinally, even if  a finding were made below,  we would be obliged\n\nto exercise de novo review, see supra p. 13.  This combination of\r                                               \n\nfactors  persuades  us  to  undertake  the  inquiry  into  actual\n\nprejudice.\n\n          A  convicted  defendant  can  establish  the  requisite\n\nprejudice in  an ineffective  assistance case by  demonstrating a\n\nreasonable probability that, but  for counsel's bevues, the trial\n\noutcome   would  have  been  different.    For  this  purpose,  a\n\nreasonable  probability  is  defined  as  that  which  undermines\n\nconfidence  in the result of the proceeding.  See Strickland, 466\r                                                                      \n\nU.S. at 694; see  also Kotteakos v. United States, 328  U.S. 750,\r                                                           \n\n764 (1946).  We caution however, that the analysis does not focus\n\nsolely on  outcome determination,  but also takes  into prominent\n\nconsideration  \"whether   the  result   of  the  proceeding   was\n\nfundamentally unfair  or unreliable.\"  Lockhart  v. Fretwell, 113\r                                                                      \n\nS. Ct. 838,  842 (1993).  This question must  be answered without\n\nreference to certain extraneous factors, such as \"the possibility\n\nof  arbitrariness,  whimsy,  caprice,  `nullification,'  and  the\n\nlike,\" which do not  legitimately enter the jury's deliberations.\n\nStrickland,  466 U.S. at 695.  With these omissions, our analysis\r                    \n\nproceeds \"on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably,\n\nconscientiously,  and impartially  applying  the  standards  that\n\ngovern the decision.\"  Id.\r                                    \n\n          Despite  Attorney Tacelli's  ineptitude, we  discern no\n\nactual   prejudice  here.     The  government   presented  clear,\n\nuncontroverted   eyewitness   testimony   from   an   agent   who\n\n                                32\r\r\n\nparticipated in  both drug-trafficking  transactions and  who had\n\nconducted more  than 30 undercover operations  during his career.\n\nEight  other law officers assisted agent  Desmond and stood ready\n\nto  testify in a substantially similar fashion if the need arose.\n\nThe risk of prejudice from Attorney Tacelli's ill-advised request\n\nthat the  jury credit the  government's witness was  minimized by\n\nthe   one-sidedness  of   the  evidence;   here,  there   was  no\n\ncontradictory  version of  the critical  events that  a skeptical\n\njury  otherwise might  have chosen  to believe.   Similarly,  any\n\nfacts  tacitly  conceded during  Attorney  Tacelli's misconceived\n\n\"conduit\" argument were overwhelmingly supported by the proof; as\n\nwe  have mentioned,  the  record contains  not  one scintilla  of\n\nexculpatory  evidence.   To this  day, petitioner  has  failed to\n\nidentify  any  promising  line  of  defense  or  to  construct  a\n\nplausible scenario  that, if exploited, might have given the jury\n\npause.\n\n          We agree with the district court's observation that, on\n\nthis record, it is difficult to imagine any rational jury failing\n\nto convict.   Because there is  neither a reasonable  probability\n\nthat the outcome of the trial would have differed if  counsel had\n\nbeen more adept  nor any solid basis for believing that the trial\n\nwas  fundamentally  unfair  or  unreliable,  no  Sixth  Amendment\n\nviolation inheres.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go  no further.   Petitioner's habeas claim  is\n\nripe  for review, but,  upon due consideration,  the claim fails.\n\n                                33\r\r\n\nHence,  the judgment below must be reversed and the case remanded\n\nto  the  district court  for the  entry  of an  appropriate order\n\nclearing the  way  for  the  Commonwealth to  resume  custody  of\n\npetitioner.\n\nReversed and remanded.\r          Reversed and remanded.\r                               \n\n                                34\r\r\n",

Hence, we reverse.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          We  glean the  essential facts  from the  transcript of\n\npetitioner's  trial in Suffolk Superior Court.  On June 10, 1987,\n\nJoseph  Desmond,  an  agent   of  the  federal  Drug  Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA), posing as a would-be cocaine purchaser, met\n\nwith  his initial  target,  Robert Ricupero,  at  a pub  in  East\n\nBoston.  At Ricupero's request, petitioner joined them.  The trio\n\ndiscussed a possible cocaine purchase and then crossed the street\n\nto  a parked limousine that bore  the insignia of the \"Snow White\n\nLimousine Service.\"  Ricupero and Scarpa entered the vehicle.  As\n\nDesmond  later  testified,  Scarpa  passed roughly  28  grams  of\n\ncocaine to Ricupero,  who handed  it to Desmond  in exchange  for\n\n$1500  in cash.   Ricupero  kept $100  and gave the  remainder to\n\nScarpa.  These events occurred under police surveillance.\n\n          The  next  encounter  between   Desmond  and  his  prey\n\noccurred   on  July  18,  1987.    In  preparation  for  it,  the\n\nauthorities again assigned a cadre of law enforcement officers to\n\nsurveillance duties.  Desmond  and Ricupero met at the  same pub.\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nAt Ricupero's  invitation, Scarpa  again  joined them.   On  this\n\noccasion, the actual exchange  occurred in the deserted stairwell\n\nof a nearby apartment building, and a fourth man, James Marcella,\n\nentered  the equation.  Desmond  testified that Marcella handed a\n\npackage  containing roughly 55  grams of  cocaine to  Scarpa, who\n\npassed the package to  Ricupero.  When Ricupero placed  the drugs\n\nwithin  Desmond's  reach, Desmond  handed  him  $3000.   Ricupero\n\nslipped the money to Scarpa, who turned it over to Marcella.\n\n          In due season, the Commonwealth indicted petitioner for\n\ndrug trafficking and unlawful distribution.  A jury convicted him\n\non all charges after a four-day trial.  The trial judge sentenced\n\nhim to serve a  lengthy prison term.   Petitioner's motion for  a\n\nnew trial  failed; the  Massachusetts Appeals Court  affirmed the\n\nconviction, see Commonwealth v.

After hearing arguments\n\npresented  by Scarpa and by the  Commonwealth, the district court\n\ngranted  the   petition.     It  found  that   defense  counsel's\n\nperformance  not  only  fell   below  an  objectively  reasonable\n\nstandard  of  proficiency  but also  caused  a  breakdown  in the\n\nadversarial  system.      This,  the   district  judge   thought,\n\nconstituted  prejudice  per  se.   Accordingly,  he  vacated  the\r                                         \n\n                                5\r\r\n\nconviction, ordered  petitioner released from state  custody, and\n\ndirected  the Commonwealth  to retry  him if  it sought  to exact\n\nfurther punishment.   The court refused respondent's  application\n\nfor a stay, and petitioner is at liberty.\n\nII.  EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES\r          II.  EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES\n\n          The Commonwealth is the real party in interest in these\n\nproceedings, and  we treat  the  case as  if  it were  the  named\n\nrespondent.   At the  outset, the Commonwealth  seeks to sidestep\n\nhabeas relief by convincing us  that petitioner failed to present\n\nhis  constitutional claim to the state courts before bolting to a\n\nfederal forum.  We are not persuaded.\n\n                    A.  Governing Principles.\r                              A.

The essence  of\n\neach inquiry looks to the likelihood that effective assistance of\n\ncounsel would have produced  a different trial outcome.   The SJC\n\nitself, while leaving open the theoretical possibility that there\n\nmight be some difference between the state and federal standards,\n\nhas  concluded that  if  their state's  test  is satisfied,  \"the\n\nFederal test  is  necessarily  met  as well.\"    Commonwealth  v.\r                                                                       \n\nFuller,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385 n.3 (Mass.  1985).

Attorney  Tacelli declined  to\n\nquestion Mugnano  and produced no witnesses  in Scarpa's defense.\n\nHis closing  argument consisted  of a  terse  explanation of  the\n\nconcept of reasonable  doubt and  a solicitation to  the jury  to\n\naccept the government's testimony:\n\n          So, I'm  asking you,  as finders of  fact, to\n          believe   Detective   Mugnano,  because   his\n          testimony,  I suggest,  is  innocuous.

Was  he a  dupe?\n          What happened  to that  money?  What  was its\n          final  destination?    Is  Scarpa  a  user of\n          drugs?  Is Scarpa  someone that Ricupero, the\n          target of the investigation   is Scarpa   was\n          he used  by Ricupero to shield himself? . . .\n          And  I'm suggesting  to you    again,  at the\n          expense of being  repetitious, Scarpa is  not\n          found   and it is undetermined   that  is the\n          word that  Agent Desmond  used on July  8th  \n          it's undetermined  if Scarpa had any  of that\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n          money.  . . .  And clearly, the source of the\n          cocaine on the 8th  was not Scarpa.

He told the jury that the Commonwealth had\n\nno obligation  to prove either  the source of the  cocaine or the\n\nultimate  destination  of the  money.   And  he  labelled defense\n\ncounsel's closing argument \"a smokescreen.\"\n\n          In due  course, the  judge instructed  the jury  on the\n\nelements  of the  trafficking offense.   He  told the  jurors, in\n\nsubstance, that to convict, they must find that the defendant (1)\n\nknowingly  (2)   possessed  cocaine;  (3)  with   the  intent  to\n\ndistribute it; and (4)  that the quantity of  cocaine must be  in\n\nexcess  of  28 grams.   See  Mass. Gen.  Laws  ch. 94C,    32E(b)\r                                     \n\n(1992).   The judge instructed the jurors to much the same effect\n\nin   regard  to   the   distribution   charge,  but   substituted\n\ndistribution  for possession  and eliminated  any reference  to a\n\nminimum quantity of  cocaine.

Believing  that  this   approach  effectively\n\nconceded the  only disputed  elements of the  charged crimes  and\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nrelieved  the prosecution of its burden of proof, the court found\n\nAttorney Tacelli's use of it  to be objectively unreasonable, and\n\ntherefore, substandard.\n\n          We uphold this  finding.

We  agree.  Thus,  we decline  to\r                    \n\nadopt the  expanded version  of Cronic  embraced by the  district\r                                                \n\ncourt.  Our reasons are manifold, but four of them are paramount.\n\n          First,  we do not think that the Court intended such an\n\nexpansion to  occur.  Second, once it is necessary to examine the\n\ntrial record  in order  to evaluate counsel's  particular errors,\n\nresort to a per se presumption is no longer justified by the wish\r                            \n\nto avoid the cost of case-by-case litigation.  An overly generous\n\nreading of Cronic would do  little more than replace case-by-case\r                           \n\nlitigation  over  prejudice  with  case-by-case  litigation  over\n\nprejudice per se.\r                          \n\n          Third,  in  our judgment  the  proper  approach to  the\n\nintended  reach  of  the   Cronic  dictum  is  informed  by   the\r                                           \n\nrefinements of the harmless-error doctrine contained in a battery\n\nof  recent  Supreme Court  cases.    Some constitutional  errors,\n\ndenominated  \"trial errors,\"  will not  result in  reversal of  a\n\nconviction  if they  are shown  to be  harmless.

Silhouetted against this backdrop,  we consider it\n\nsupremely  important that  Attorney Tacelli's blunders  cannot be\n\njudged  solely   by  the   \"surrounding  circumstances\"  of   the\n\nrepresentation, but, rather, must be judged in light of the whole\n\nrecord, including  the facts of  the case, the  trial transcript,\n\nthe exhibits, and  the applicable substantive  law.  We  conclude\n\nthat this characterization places the case beyond Cronic's reach.\r                                                                  \n\nPut  bluntly,  because  Attorney  Tacelli's errors  are  more  an\n\nexample  of  maladroit   performance  than  of   non-performance,\n\nStrickland necessitates  an inquiry into the  existence of actual\r                    \n\nprejudice.\n\n                                2.\r                                          2.\n\n          Since the district court presumed prejudice, it made no\n\nexplicit findings on the second prong of the Strickland test.

The  origins of\n\nthe case date back to 1987;  the parties have briefed and  argued\n\nthe  issue of actual prejudice;  and the record  is sufficient to\n\npermit  us to perform the decisionmaking task.  Moreover, all the\n\nevidence was taken in the state courts; thus, we are in as good a\n\nposition as the federal district judge to probe the matter.

Similarly,  any\n\nfacts  tacitly  conceded during  Attorney  Tacelli's misconceived\n\n\"conduit\" argument were overwhelmingly supported by the proof; as\n\nwe  have mentioned,  the  record contains  not  one scintilla  of\n\nexculpatory  evidence.   To this  day, petitioner  has  failed to\n\nidentify  any  promising  line  of  defense  or  to  construct  a\n\nplausible scenario  that, if exploited, might have given the jury\n\npause.\n\n          We agree with the district court's observation that, on\n\nthis record, it is difficult to imagine any rational jury failing\n\nto convict.   Because there is  neither a reasonable  probability\n\nthat the outcome of the trial would have differed if  counsel had\n\nbeen more adept  nor any solid basis for believing that the trial\n\nwas  fundamentally  unfair  or  unreliable,  no  Sixth  Amendment\n\nviolation inheres.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go  no further.   Petitioner's habeas claim  is\n\nripe  for review, but,  upon due consideration,  the claim fails.\n\n                                33\r\r\n\nHence,  the judgment below must be reversed and the case remanded\n\nto  the  district court  for the  entry  of an  appropriate order\n\nclearing the  way  for  the  Commonwealth to  resume  custody  of\n\npetitioner.\n\nReversed and remanded.\r          Reversed and remanded.\r                               \n\n                                34\r\r\n</pre>",
