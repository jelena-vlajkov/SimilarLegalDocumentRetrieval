On October 12, 1993, we remanded this case\r                            \n\nso  that plaintiff  (as he  had  requested) might  attempt to\n\namend  his complaint  to state  a claim  under Bivens  v. Six\r                                                                         \n\nUnknown Named Agents, 403  U.S. 388 (1971).  See  Figueroa v.\r                                                                      \n\nDEA,  7  F.3d  218  (1st Cir.  1993)  (table)  (per  curiam).\r               \n\nPlaintiff  thereafter failed  to  do so,  and  took no  other\n\naction  apart from submitting a change of address form to the\n\ndistrict court.  On April 21, 1994, defendants filed a motion\n\nto  dismiss  under  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.  41(b)  for failure  to\n\nprosecute.   Plaintiff filed no opposition,  and the district\n\ncourt  granted  the  motion on  May  19,  1994.   Having  now\n\nappealed from  this ruling,  plaintiff makes no  reference to\n\nthe Rule 41(b) dismissal in his principal brief.  Only in his\n\nreply brief does he attempt an explanation, alleging that (1)\n\nhe  had  assumed  the   district  court  would  initiate  the\n\nnecessary further  proceedings, and  (2) he never  received a\n\ncopy  of  the  defendants'  motion to  dismiss  (despite  the\n\nappearance therein of a proper certificate of service).\n\n     We affirm.  By failing to  seek reconsideration below (a\n\nmeasure he has  employed earlier in this litigation),  and by\n\nfailing  to  challenge  the   Rule  41(b)  dismissal  in  his\n\nprincipal brief  on appeal,  plaintiff has waived  the issue.\n\nSee,  e.g., Rivera-Muriente v.  Agosto-Alicea, 959  F.2d 349,\r                                                         \n\n354 (1st  Cir. 1992) (\"It is  well settled in  this court ...\n\nthat  a  legal  argument  made  for  the  first  time  in  an\r\r\n\nappellant's  reply  brief  comes too  late  and  need not  be\n\naddressed.\").  We add that invocation of the waiver rule here\n\nwould work no injustice, inasmuch as plaintiff's  substantive\n\nclaim (upon which he has elaborated in his appellate  papers)\n\nappears  entirely meritless.  By way of the instant attack on\n\nthe forfeiture of his assets, plaintiff is seeking  simply to\n\nchallenge  the sufficiency  of  the  evidence supporting  his\n\nunderlying   conviction--a   challenge  we   have  decisively\n\nrejected in the past.  See Figueroa v. United States, 19 F.3d\r                                                                \n\n7  (1st  Cir. 1994)  (table) (per  curiam); United  States v.\r                                                                      \n\nFigueroa, 976 F.2d 1446 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S.\r                                                                 \n\nCt. 1346 (1993).\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
