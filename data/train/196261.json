Carlow now  appeals  his  conviction and  sentence.\r\n\nBecause we discern no error, we affirm.\r\n\n          For three months in 1990, Carlow used  the name William\r\n\nHarmon in  29 wire transmissions  to buy computer  equipment from\r\n\nsuppliers  all  over  the United  States  for  a retail  computer\r\n\ncompany in  Maine.  Carlow ordered  increasingly large quantities\r\n\nof  equipment and  paid by  company checks  that bounced.   After\r\n\nCarlow  was arrested on November  30, 1990, he  opened a computer\r\n\ncompany called Electrobyte.  Through this company, Carlow engaged\r\n\nin a  similar pattern of  fraudulent mail and  wire transactions.\r\n\nCarlow was arrested once again in September 1991.\r\n\n          At  his trial, Carlow's  theory of defense  was that he\r\n\nlacked  the requisite intent to  defraud, and his  main source of\r\n\nevidence  in  support of  this  argument was  his  own testimony.\r\n\nClosing arguments focused,  not surprisingly, on the  credibility\r\n\nof Carlow's testimony.  After  deliberating for over three hours,\r\n\nthe  jury found  Carlow  guilty on  all 54  counts.   Carlow  was\r\n\nsentenced on October 19, 1994 to 51 months' imprisonment, and was\r\n\nordered to pay restitution in the amount of $111,649.65.\r\n\n          Carlow now  offers several  arguments to  challenge his\r\n\nconviction and  sentence, contending: 1) that  the district court\r\n\nimproperly   calculated  his   sentence   under  the   Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines; 2) that the court erred in ordering restitution in an\r\n\namount greater than $50,000;  3) that the court erred  in finding\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nthat Carlow's  conduct involved  more than minimal  planning, and\r\n\nfor failing to  decrease his  sentence based on  his role in  the\r\n\noffense; that the court  erred in instructing the jury  at trial;\r\n\n5)  that the evidence adduced at trial is insufficient to sustain\r\n\nhis  conviction;   and  6)  that   Carlow  received   ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel at trial.\r\n\n          Having  carefully  reviewed  the entire  record  of the\r\n\ntrial  and sentencing, we find  no discernible error  or abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion  by  the  district  court.1   Accordingly,  we  reject\r\n\nCarlow's contentions on appeal, and affirm.\r                                                    \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Because we  ordinarily refrain from  entertaining ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel claims  on direct review, United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\nMala, 7  F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993), and we see no reason to\r              \r\ndepart  from  this   rule  here,  we  do  not   address  Carlow's\r\nineffective assistance argument here.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n",
