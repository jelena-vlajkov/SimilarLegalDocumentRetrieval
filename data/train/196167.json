Walter Jay Skinner, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Cyr, Boudin and Stahl,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nKevin G.

This is an appeal of a district court order\r                           \r\n\ndenying the  motion of petitioner  Kevin Taylor to  set aside\r\n\nhis conviction  and sentence.    See 28  U.S.C.    2255.   We\r                                                \r\n\naffirm  the district  court's  order  substantially  for  the\r\n\nreasons given by Judge Skinner, adding a brief comment.  Like\r\n\nthe district court, we  can find no indication that  the lack\r\n\nof  counsel at  arraignment affected  petitioner's subsequent\r\n\ntrial.   No  presumption exists  that lack  of counsel  at an\r\n\narraignment   prejudices   all  subsequent   stages   of  the\r\n\nproceeding where, as here,  the only significant happening at\r\n\nthe arraignment  was the entry  of a not  guilty plea.   And,\r\n\nwithout some  infection of the subsequent  proceedings, there\r\n\nis no warrant for relief under   2255.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  \r                         \r\r\n",
