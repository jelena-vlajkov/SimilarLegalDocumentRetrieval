Plaintiff-appellant Wilfred Hart, Jr.\r                                 \n\n  has appealed from a district court order denying him leave to\n\n  file a motion to dissolve a district court injunction barring\n\n  him from certain filings  without leave of court.   We affirm\n\n  the district court's ruling.\n\n       On  June  23,  1992,  the  district  court  entered  the\n\n  following injunction against Hart:\n\n          It  is hereby  ORDERED that  Wilfred  Hart is\r                                          \n          enjoined from filing  any motions,  pleadings\n          or papers of whatever  type or description in\n          the District of Maine, in connection with his\n          1988  conviction   for  controlled  substance\n          violations  without  prior  leave  of  Court.\n          Hart  may seek  leave  of Court  by filing  a\n          summary of the claims  he seeks to raise (not\n          to  exceed one page  per claim) together with\n          an affidavit certifying  that the claims  are\n          novel  and have  not  previously been  raised\n          before this Court or any other federal court.\n          Upon failure  to so certify or  failure to so\n          certify  truthfully,  Hart  may be  found  in\n          contempt of court and punished accordingly.\n\nThe  injunction was issued in response to what the district court\n\ndescribed  as Hart's \"frivolous motions and duplicative pleadings\n\nwhich  encroach on the Court's limited time  and resources, . . .\n\nwhich can only be calculated to disrupt the orderly consideration\n\nof  cases, .  .  . and  which  merely restate  claims  which have\n\nalready made [sic] and which have been denied.\"\n\n       Hart  appealed the injunction  to this  court, challenging\n\nits  legality  and  constitutionality  on a  number  of  grounds,\n\nincluding  vagueness.  On March 21, 1994, this court rejected all\r\r\n\nof  Hart's  challenges, and  affirmed  the injunction.    Hart v.\r                                                                        \n\nUnited States, slip op., nos. 92-1801, 92-2292, 92-2449 (1st Cir.\r                       \n\n3/21/94)  (unpublished).   We  stated that  we  would \"leave  the\n\nconstruction of the injunction to the district court in the first\n\ninstance.\"  Id. at 6.\r                        \n\n       On May 20, 1994, Hart filed a motion for leave of court to\n\nfile  an accompanying motion for  a three-judge panel to dissolve\n\nthe  injunction.  The  underlying motion to  dissolve argued that\n\nthe  district court's \"operative  construction\" of the injunction\n\nwas so narrow as to unconstitutionally limit Hart's access to the\n\ncourts.   On the same day,  the district court denied  the motion\n\nfor  leave of  court,  endorsing  it  as  follows:    \"Claim  has\n\npreviously  been  raised  and  is  therefore  not  novel.\"   Hart\n\nappeals.\n\n       On the surface,  it would seem  that in his May  20 motion\n\nHart did seek to  raise an issue not  raised in his appeal.   The\n\nappeal upheld the facial terms of the  injunction, whereas Hart's\n\nMay  20 motion  seems to  challenge the constitutionality  of the\n\nmanner  in  which  the district  court  has  later construed  and\n\napplied the injunction.  In fact, however, Hart's motion fails to\n\nspecify  in what way the district court should be thought to have\n\napplied  the injunction  in an  unconstitutional manner.   Hart's\n\nmotion, therefore, appears to be, in substance, nothing more than\n\nanother attack on the terms of the injunction.  Such an attack is\n\nnot novel, having already been mounted in Hart's prior appeal.\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n       In any event, even if Hart's motion were to be regarded as\n\nraising  a  novel claim,  we would  affirm  its dismissal  on the\n\nground  that it  was frivolous.   Insofar  as Hart's  motion once\n\nagain challenges  the terms of the injunction,  res judicata bars\n\nany relief  by virtue of our prior ruling.  Insofar as the motion\n\ndoes   assert  that  the  injunction  has   been  applied  in  an\n\nunconstitutional manner, the  motion provides no basis for such a\n\nconclusion.    Any  challenge  to the  injunction's  application,\n\nmoreover,  should  properly be  raised  in  conjunction with  the\n\nparticular  matter to  which  the injunction  allegedly has  been\n\nimproperly  applied.  Finally, the motion's request that a three-\n\njudge court be convened to consider the matter is frivolous.\n\n       The ruling of the district court is affirmed. \r                                                             \n\n                               -4-\r\r\n",
