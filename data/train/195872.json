The\n\nprincipal  issue in  this appeal  is Bohai's argument  that  \n\n2320(d) is unconstitutionally vague.  Because we find no such\n\ninfirmity, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n                         BACKGROUND1  \r                                     BACKGROUND\r                                               \n\n          In 1987 and 1988,  Bohai2 arranged for the overseas\n\nmanufacture  of  sneakers  for  the Stride  Rite  Corporation\n\n(\"Stride Rite\"),  the owner  of the  KEDS trademark.   Stride\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  In reviewing the district court's  denial of a motion  to\ndismiss, we take the factual allegations in the indictment as\ntrue.  Boyce Motor Lines v. United States,  342 U.S. 337, 343\r                                                     \nn.16  (1952); United  States v.  Barker Steel  Co., 985  F.2d\r                                                              \n1123,  1125 (1st  Cir. 1993).   In this  case, the  motion to\ndismiss  initially   challenged  all   five  counts  of   the\nindictment and, therefore, the factual  allegations contained\nin the  entire indictment  were properly before  the district\ncourt.  On this appeal, we review the motion  to dismiss only\nas to counts one and three (as explained below, pursuant to a\nplea agreement, the  district court granted  the government's\nmotion  to dismiss  the remaining  counts).  Because  of this\nprocedural  setting,  on this  appeal  we  take as  true  the\nfactual allegations contained in the entire indictment.  \n\n2.  Some  of  the  events  described  here  involved  Bohai's\npredecessor, Brayco International Corporation, Inc.  \n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nRite  placed   two  separate   orders  with  Bohai   for  the\n\nmanufacture of 100,000 pairs per order of women's canvas vamp\n\noxford  (\"CVO\")  sneakers  bearing  the  KEDS  mark.    Bohai\n\narranged for the shoes to be manufactured at the Qing  Dao #9\n\nRubber Factory, a government-owned enterprise in the People's\n\nRepublic of  China (\"PRC\").   Stride Rite  terminated Bohai's\n\nauthority to apply  the KEDS mark to the  shoes in the spring\n\nof 1989.\n\n          Beginning in August  1989, Bohai's president, James\n\nL. Bryant, devised a plan to produce CVO sneakers bearing the\n\nKEDS mark in the PRC and distribute them in the United States\n\nwithout the knowledge or authorization of Stride Rite.  Bohai\n\narranged  for the production of the shoes at the PRC factory.\n\nIn September 1989, a  United States-based purchaser agreed to\n\nbuy  100,000 pairs of the shoes but asked for assurances that\n\nthey  were  not counterfeit.    A Bohai  employee  showed the\n\npurchaser  a   purported  Stride  Rite   purchase  order  for\n\napproximately  100,000  pairs of  CVO  shoes.   However,  the\n\npurchase order pertained to a separate, previous order of CVO\n\nshoes and had nothing to do with the shoes then being sold to\n\nthe  purchaser.   The employee  falsely represented  that the\n\nshoes had been ordered and produced for Stride Rite, but that\n\nStride Rite  had rejected them.   In fact, the  shoes had not\n\nyet been manufactured and Stride Rite had no knowledge of the\n\nplan to produce or import them.\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          The Qing Dao factory produced the shoes and applied\n\nthe  KEDS mark  to them.   Bryant  and  others took  steps to\n\nconceal  the fact  that trademarks  had been  applied to  the\n\nshoes without the knowledge or permission of Stride Rite.  In\n\nDecember 1989, Bryant instructed the PRC factory to stamp the\n\nshoes  then being  produced to  falsely reflect  a production\n\ndate of 1988.  Documents were also backdated.  \n\n          In March 1990,  the counterfeit shoes entered  this\n\ncountry through  Boston.  The  invoice presented to  the U.S.\n\nCustoms Service at the  time of entry falsely  indicated that\n\nthe  shoes had been  manufactured pursuant to  a valid Stride\n\nRite  purchase order  and were  intended to  be delivered  to\n\nStride  Rite or its consignee.   After entry,  an employee of\n\nBohai  directed  the  shipper  to  deliver  the  shoes  to  a\n\nwarehouse  in  Holbrook, Massachusetts,  rather  than  to the\n\nStride  Rite warehouse  in New  Bedford, Massachusetts.   The\n\nemployee  explained to  the shipping  company that  Bohai and\n\nStride Rite were manufacturing the shoes together as a \"joint\n\nventure\" and, therefore, Bohai was an  agent for Stride Rite.\n\nAfter the purchaser inspected  the shoes, they were delivered\n\nto  New Jersey,  where  they  were  sold  to  the  public  as\n\nauthentic KEDS CVO shoes  through a national department store\n\nchain.  On March 27, 1990, Bohai received a wire transfer for\n\n$410,032 from the purchaser for the 100,000 shoes.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          On April  29, 1993,  a federal grand  jury indicted\n\nBohai,  Bryant and Bohai's  Treasurer, Herbert Chih-Lun Wang,\n\nunder one  count charging  violations of  18 U.S.C.    2320,3\n\none  count charging  violations  of  18  U.S.C.    542,4  two\n\ncounts  of conspiracy under 18  U.S.C.   371,5  and one count\n\ncharging violations  of 18 U.S.C.    1957.6   The  defendants\n\nmoved to dismiss the indictment on various grounds, including\n\nthat     2320 did  not  give  them constitutionally  adequate\n\nnotice of the illegality  of their acts.  The  district court\n\nheld  a  hearing and,  in an  order  dated October  29, 1993,\n\ndenied   the  defendants'  motion.    Negotiations  with  the\n\ngovernment ensued.   On  February 17,  1994, Bohai  entered a\n\nconditional plea of guilty under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2) to\n\nthe first and  third counts of the  indictment, which alleged\n\nviolations of     2320 and  542 respectively.   The agreement\n\nexpressly reserved Bohai's right to seek review of the denial\n\nof  the motion to dismiss.   The district  court then granted\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  18  U.S.C.    2320 provides  that \"whoever  intentionally\ntraffics  or attempts  to traffic  in goods  or services  and\nknowingly uses a counterfeit mark\" may be subject to fine and\nimprisonment.  \n\n4.  18 U.S.C.    542  prohibits the  importation of goods  by\nmeans of false or fraudulent practices.\n\n5.  Counts  two   and  four   of   the  indictment   alleged,\nrespectively, conspiracy to traffic in  counterfeit goods and\nconspiracy to  import goods by  means of false  or fraudulent\npractices.\n\n6.  18  U.S.C.      1957  prohibits   engaging  in   monetary\ntransactions in property derived from unlawful activity.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe government's motion to  dismiss all counts against Bryant\n\nand Wang and  to dismiss the conspiracy and  money laundering\n\ncounts against  Bohai.   Following a sentencing  hearing, the\n\ndistrict  court sentenced  Bohai to  probation and  imposed a\n\nfine of $100,000 for violations of counts one and three.  The\n\ndistrict  court  also  ordered   Bohai  to  pay  $100,000  in\n\nrestitution to Stride Rite.7  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\n          Bohai  argues  that  the  district  court  erred in\n\ndenying  Bohai's motion  to  dismiss the  indictment for  two\n\nprincipal   reasons:       (1)   18   U.S.C.        2320   is\n\nunconstitutionally vague; and (2) even if the statute is  not\n\nconstitutionally infirm, Bohai nonetheless lacked fair notice\n\nbecause of    2320's legislative history  and a then-existing\n\nCustoms  Service  regulation   issued  pursuant  to   another\n\nstatute.  We address Bohai's arguments in order.8\n\n                    \r                                \n\n7.  Pursuant  to the  plea agreement,  the restitution  is in\nescrow pending this  appeal.  The agreement  provides that if\nthis  court finds count one (charging under 18 U.S.C.   2320)\nis legally invalid, the restitution and any interest  will be\nreturned to Bohai.\n\n8.  Bohai  also challenges  count  three, which  charges that\nBohai knowingly  and intentionally  sought to  import 100,000\npairs of  shoes \"bearing counterfeit (as defined  in Title 18\nU.S.C. Section 2320(d))  blue rectangular  heel patches  with\nthe name  `KEDS' on them,  by means  of one or  more material\nfalse statements . . .\"  in violation of 18 U.S.C.   542.  As\nBohai notes, the \"indictment  expressly ties [count three] to\na   violation  of  section   2320.\"    Because   we  find  no\nconstitutional  infirmity  with  regard to     2320,  Bohai's\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          The  due  process  clause  of the  Fifth  Amendment\r                      \n\nrequires  that a criminal  statute be  sufficiently definite.\n\nThe \"requirement  of definiteness  is violated by  a criminal\n\nstatute that fails to give a person of ordinary  intelligence\n\nfair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the\n\nstatute.\"   United  States  v.  Harriss, 347  U.S.  612,  617\r                                                   \n\n(1954); see also Grayned  v.

Bohai specifically  focuses on the word \"production,\"\n\narguing that it has  \"no core meaning\" and that   2320 leaves\n\nthe  reader  helpless  \"to  understand  what  aspect  of  the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n9.  We  set forth the relevant portion of 18 U.S.C.   2320(d)\nwith the \"authorized-use\" language underscored: \n\n     (d)  For purposes of this section --\n          (1)  the term \"counterfeit mark\" means -- \n               (A)  a spurious mark --\n                    (i)   that  is  used  in connection  with\n                    trafficking in goods or services;\n                    (ii)     that   is  identical   with,  or\n                    substantially  indistinguishable from,  a\n                    mark  registered  for   those  goods   or\n                    services on the principal register in the\n                    United States Patent and Trademark Office\n                    and in use, whether  or not the defendant\n                    knew such mark was so registered; and\n                    (iii) the use of which is likely to cause\n                    confusion,  to  cause   mistake,  or   to\n                    deceive; or\n               (B)   a spurious designation that is identical\n               with, or substantially indistinguishable from,\n               a designation as to  which the remedies of the\n               Lanham  Act are  made  available by  reason of\n               section 110 of the Olympic Charter Act;\n     but such term does not include any mark or designation  \r                                                                       \n     used in connection with goods or services of which the  \r                                                                       \n     manufacturer or producer was, at the time of the        \r                                                                 \n     manufacture or production in question authorized to use \r                                                                        \n     the mark  for  designation  for  the type  of  goods  or\r                                                                         \nservices        so manufactured or produced, by the holder of\r                                                                         \nthe right to       use such mark or designation.\r                                                           \n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nproduction  process  --   i.e.,  creating,  bringing   about,\n\nfurnishing,  or yielding the goods in question -- is relevant\n\nin dating the  existence of generalized authority  to use the\n\nmark on goods of the same type.\"  \n\n          Bohai's  statutory  analysis  suffers from  extreme\n\nmyopia.  As  we have observed in  the past, statutes are  not\n\nenacted on a  piecemeal basis and, accordingly, should not be\n\nread  that way.   See  Little People's  Sch., Inc.  v. United\r                                                                         \n\nStates, 842 F.2d 570, 573 (1st Cir. 1988).  By broadening the\r                  \n\nfocus and examining the phrase \"at the time of manufacture or\n\nproduction\" in  the  context  of  the  entire  authorized-use\n\nexception, see,  e.g., id.,  we think that  Bohai's vagueness\r                                      \n\nchallenge cannot  be sustained.  Based on  the plain language\n\nof the statute, we conclude  that Congress intended, and made\n\nsufficiently plain,  that this exception would  be limited to\n\nthose  goods  or  services  for  which authorization  existed\n\nduring  the entire period  of production or  manufacture.  We\r                              \n\nfocus on Congress's  statement that authorization  must exist\n\n\"at the time of the manufacture or production in question . .\r                           \n\n.  for the  type  of goods  or  services so  manufactured  or\r                                                                         \n\nproduced.\"  Though perhaps  not a model of the  most exacting\r                    \n\nlegislative craftsmanship, we think this language nonetheless\n\nmakes clear beyond reasonable dispute that  the authorization\n\nto use  the mark must exist  \"at the time of,\"  that is, from\n\nbeginning  of  the  production   or  manufacture  up  to  and\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nincluding the time at  which the goods or services  have been\n\nfinally \"manufactured or produced.\"   \n\n          We believe  that Bohai could  reasonably understand\n\nfrom  the  statutory language  that  conduct  charged in  the\n\nindictment was not within  the authorized-use exception.  The\n\ngovernment charges that Bohai was not authorized to apply the\n\nmarks  to  100,000 pairs  of  CVO shoes,  conduct  that falls\n\nsquarely outside the statute's exception.   Bohai asks us  to\n\nconsider the language in light of the \"undisputed fact\" that,\n\nin  1988, it had authority  from Stride Rite  to assemble raw\n\nmaterials, import  sewing machines  and molds, and  train the\n\nQing Dao  workers to produce  the KEDS CVO shoes.10   For the\n\nreasons outlined  above, the  language of the  statute cannot\n\nsustain   Bohai's  assertion  that   these  activities  alone\n\nconstitute \"production\" within the meaning of the authorized-\n\nuse  exception.  While Bohai's  activities in 1988 might have\n\nbeen steps  in the  production process, the  statute requires\n\nthat authorization  exist until  production is complete.   In\n\nshort,  on these facts, we do not  think this language can be\n\nreasonably    described    as     ambiguous,    much     less\n\nunconstitutionally vague.     Bohai makes  the additional and\n\nsomewhat novel  argument that,  even  if the  statute is  not\n\n                    \r                                \n\n10.  On this  point, the  district court  noted in  its order\nthat,  although  it was  not alleged  in the  indictment, the\ngovernment  did concede that the defendants  were at one time\r                                                                         \nauthorized to apply the  KEDS trademark to shoes manufactured\nat the Qing Dao factory.  \n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nvague, Bohai lacked fair  notice in light of  the legislative\n\nhistory  of   2320 as well as a then-existing Customs Service\n\nregulation.  We  do not  agree.  As  to legislative  history,\n\nBohai  argues that it \"is relevant insofar as it discloses no\n\nintention  to  criminalize the  type  of  conduct at  issue.\"\n\nBohai  then presents  a lengthy  examination of  various non-\n\nstatutory materials.   As a general proposition, when a court\n\nfinds  \"clear  meaning in  the  unvarnished  language of  the\n\nstatute, [it is] duty bound to honor that  meaning.\"  Baez v.\r                                                                      \n\nINS, No.  94-1224, slip op.  at 13 (1st  Cir. Dec. 6,  1994).\r               \n\nConsequently,  a  court  may  seldom engage  in  a  boundless\n\nexploration of unenacted legislative materials.  See id.; see\r                                                                         \n\nalso Laracuente v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 891 F.2d 17, 23 (1st\r                                                   \n\nCir. 1989)  (\"[A]bsent ambiguity  in the  statutory language,\n\nour inquiry is complete  and ends with the plain  language of\n\nthe  statute.\").    Bohai's  use  of non-statutory  materials\n\ndemonstrates the  wisdom  of this  rule.   Bohai relies  upon\n\nlegislative history  for  the  dubious  proposition  that  it\n\ndiscloses no congressional intent to criminalize the activity\n\nat issue.   Under  the Constitution, Congress  speaks through\n\nduly enacted bills and  resolutions; as to legislation, there\n\nis no requirement  that Congress  memorialize anything,  much\n\nless  its intent, through  unenacted non-statutory materials.\n\nAccordingly, Congress's failure to do so can hardly  be cited\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nas  proof  of  a defendant's  argument  that  it lacked  fair\n\nnotice.11   \n\n          We also  disagree with Bohai's  analytical premise.\n\nOn an  appeal like this one, the  issue is simply whether the\n\nstatute, as enacted by  Congress, gave sufficient notice that\n\nthe conduct charged was proscribed.  Once we  have determined\n\nthat the statute is constitutionally sufficient, our analysis\n\nends.     Bohai  seeks  to  go  a  step  farther  and  create\n\nuncertainty by  referring to  wholly extraneous matters.   We\n\nare  not  so easily  distracted.    Thus, Bohai's  exhaustive\n\ntreatment of the Customs  Service regulation, appearing at 19\n\nC.F.R.   133.21(c)(3), is also unavailing.12  \n\n                    \r                                \n\n11.  As   Judge  Harold   Leventhal  once   observed,  citing\nlegislative history  is akin  to \"looking  over  a crowd  and\npicking  out   your  friends.\"     Patricia  M.   Wald,  Some\r                                                                         \nObservations On the  Use of Legislative  History in the  1981\r                                                                         \nSupreme Court Term, 68  Iowa L.

Prior to 1988, 19 C.F.R.   133.21(c)(3), issued pursuant\nto  Section 526 of the Tariff Act  of 1930, 19 U.S.C.   1526,\nprovided that  if \"the articles of foreign manufacture bear a\nrecorded  trademark or tradename  applied under authorization\nof the United States  owner,\" then the Customs  Service would\nnot  prevent importation.   Bohai's  fair notice  argument is\ngrounded  in  its  assertion  that the  Customs  Service  had\nroutinely  admitted trademarked goods produced by \"authorized\nmanufacturers\"   without  regard   to   the  timing   of  the\nmanufacture.\n          We do  not agree with Bohai that  Grayned, 408 U.S.\r                                                               \nat   110,   supports   the   broad   proposition   that   the\n\"administrative  practice of  the agency  principally charged\nwith enforcing  Section  2320 is  significant in  determining\nwhether  that section  provided  fair notice  to Bohai.\"   In\nGrayned,  a First Amendment  case, the Court  stated that, in\r                   \nthe absence of an  interpretation of the meaning of  an anti-\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \n\n          Because we conclude that  the language of 18 U.S.C.\n\n  2320 is sufficiently definite so as to give fair  notice to\n\nBohai  that  the  conduct   alleged  in  the  indictment  was\n\nproscribed, the judgment of the district court is\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed.\r                              \n\n                    \r                                \n\nnoise ordinance  from the court below,  it would \"extrapolate\nits allowable meaning . . .

Sec. 2320 and that it imported goods by means of false or fraudulent practices in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 542.

Stride Rite placed two separate orders with Bohai for the manufacture of 100,000 pairs per order of women's canvas vamp oxford (\"CVO\") sneakers bearing the KEDS mark.  Bohai arranged for the shoes to be manufactured at the Qing Dao # 9 Rubber Factory, a government-owned enterprise in the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\").  Stride Rite terminated Bohai's authority to apply the KEDS mark to the shoes in the spring of 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in August 1989, Bohai's president, James L. Bryant, devised a plan to produce CVO sneakers bearing the KEDS mark in the PRC and distribute them in the United States without the knowledge or authorization of Stride Rite.  Bohai arranged for the production of the shoes at the PRC factory.  In September 1989, a United States-based purchaser agreed to buy 100,000 pairs of the shoes but asked for assurances that they were not counterfeit.  A Bohai employee showed the purchaser a purported Stride Rite purchase order for approximately 100,000 pairs of CVO shoes.  However, the purchase order pertained to a separate, previous order of CVO shoes and had nothing to do with the shoes then being sold to the purchaser.  The employee falsely represented that the shoes had been ordered and produced for Stride Rite, but that Stride Rite had rejected them.  In fact, the shoes had not yet been manufactured and Stride Rite had no knowledge of the plan to produce or import them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Qing Dao factory produced the shoes and applied the KEDS mark to them.  Bryant and others took steps to conceal the fact that trademarks had been applied to the shoes without the knowledge or permission of Stride Rite.  In December 1989, Bryant instructed the PRC factory to stamp the shoes then being produced to falsely reflect a production date of 1988.  Documents were also backdated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990, the counterfeit shoes entered this country through Boston.  The invoice presented to the U.S. Customs Service at the time of entry falsely indicated that the shoes had been manufactured pursuant to a valid Stride Rite purchase order and were intended to be delivered to Stride Rite or its consignee.  After entry, an employee of Bohai directed the shipper to deliver the shoes to a warehouse in Holbrook, Massachusetts, rather than to the Stride Rite warehouse in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  The employee explained to the shipping company that Bohai and Stride Rite were manufacturing the shoes together as a \"joint venture\" and, therefore, Bohai was an agent for Stride Rite.  After the purchaser inspected the shoes, they were delivered to New Jersey, where they were sold to the public as authentic KEDS CVO shoes through a national department store chain.  On March 27, 1990, Bohai received a wire transfer for $410,032 from the purchaser for the 100,000 shoes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 1993, a federal grand jury indicted Bohai, Bryant and Bohai's Treasurer, Herbert Chih-Lun Wang, under one count charging violations of 18 U.S.C.

The district court held a hearing and, in an order dated October 29, 1993, denied the defendants' motion.  Negotiations with the government ensued.  On February 17, 1994, Bohai entered a conditional plea of guilty under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2) to the first and third counts of the indictment, which alleged violations of Secs. 2320 and 542 respectively.  The agreement expressly reserved Bohai's right to seek review of the denial of the motion to dismiss.  The district court then granted the government's motion to dismiss all counts against Bryant and Wang and to dismiss the conspiracy and money laundering counts against Bohai.  Following a sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Bohai to probation and imposed a fine of $100,000 for violations of counts one and three.  The district court also ordered Bohai to pay $100,000 in restitution to Stride Rite.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bohai argues that the district court erred in denying Bohai's motion to dismiss the indictment for two principal reasons:  (1) 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2320 is unconstitutionally vague;  and (2) even if the statute is not constitutionally infirm, Bohai nonetheless lacked fair notice because of Sec. 2320's legislative history and a then-existing Customs Service regulation issued pursuant to another statute.  We address Bohai's arguments in order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal statute be sufficiently definite.  The \"requirement of definiteness is violated by a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute.\"  United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 811-12, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954);  see also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298-99, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (\"It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.\").  \"The question is whether, looking at the statute in light of the facts of the case at hand, [it] provide[s] a constitutionally adequate warning to those whose activities are governed.\"  United States v. Buckalew, 859 F.2d 1052, 1054 (1st Cir.1988) (quotations and citations omitted);  see also United States v. National Dairy Prods.  Corp., 372 U.S. 29, 33, 83 S.Ct. 594, 598, 9 L.Ed.2d 561 (1963) (\"In determining the sufficiency of the notice a statute must of necessity be examined in light of the conduct with which a defendant is charged.\").  Our task, therefore, is to determine whether 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2320 gave Bohai adequate warning that, as alleged in the indictment, \"knowingly [using] counterfeit marks without the authorization of the holder of the right to use such marks\" is unlawful.  Our review is de novo.  See, e.g., United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 105, 121 L.Ed.2d 64 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bohai argues that the phrase \"at the time of the manufacture or production\" as used in the so-called \"authorized-use\" exception to Sec. 2320's definition of counterfeit goods<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> renders the statute unconstitutionally vague.  Bohai specifically focuses on the word \"production,\" arguing that it has \"no core meaning\" and that Sec. 2320 leaves the reader helpless \"to understand what aspect of the production process--i.e., creating, bringing about, furnishing, or yielding the goods in question--is relevant in dating the existence of generalized authority to use the mark on goods of the same type.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bohai's statutory analysis suffers from extreme myopia.  As we have observed in the past, statutes are not enacted on a piecemeal basis and, accordingly, should not be read that way.  See Little People's Sch., Inc. v. United States, 842 F.2d 570, 573 (1st Cir.1988).  By broadening the focus and examining the phrase \"at the time of manufacture or production\" in the context of the entire authorized-use exception, see, e.g., id., we think that Bohai's vagueness challenge cannot be sustained.  Based on the plain language of the statute, we conclude that Congress intended, and made sufficiently plain, that this exception would be limited to those goods or services for which authorization existed during the entire period of production or manufacture.  We focus on Congress's statement that authorization must exist \"at the time of the manufacture or production in question ... for the type of goods or services so manufactured or produced.\"   Though perhaps not a model of the most exacting legislative craftsmanship, we think this language nonetheless makes clear beyond reasonable dispute that the authorization to use the mark must exist \"at the time of,\" that is, from beginning of the production or manufacture up to and including the time at which the goods or services have been finally \"manufactured or produced.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that Bohai could reasonably understand from the statutory language that conduct charged in the indictment was not within the authorized-use exception.  The government charges that Bohai was not authorized to apply the marks to 100,000 pairs of CVO shoes, conduct that falls squarely outside the statute's exception.  Bohai asks us to consider the language in light of the \"undisputed fact\" that, in 1988, it had authority from Stride Rite to assemble raw materials, import sewing machines and molds, and train the Qing Dao workers to produce the KEDS CVO shoes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  For the reasons outlined above, the language of the statute cannot sustain Bohai's assertion that these activities alone constitute \"production\" within the meaning of the authorized-use exception.  While Bohai's activities in 1988 might have been steps in the production process, the statute requires that authorization exist until production is complete.  In short, on these facts, we do not think this language can be reasonably described as ambiguous, much less unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bohai makes the additional and somewhat novel argument that, even if the statute is not vague, Bohai lacked fair notice in light of the legislative history of Sec. 2320 as well as a then-existing Customs Service regulation.  We do not agree.  As to legislative history, Bohai argues that it \"is relevant insofar as it discloses no intention to criminalize the type of conduct at issue.\"   Bohai then presents a lengthy examination of various non-statutory materials.  As a general proposition, when a court finds \"clear meaning in the unvarnished language of the statute, [it is] duty bound to honor that meaning.\"  Baez v. INS, 41 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir.1994).  Consequently, a court may seldom engage in a boundless exploration of unenacted legislative materials.  See id.;   see also Laracuente v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 891 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[A]bsent ambiguity in the statutory language, our inquiry is complete and ends with the plain language of the statute.\").  Bohai's use of nonstatutory materials demonstrates the wisdom of this rule.  Bohai relies upon legislative history for the dubious proposition that it discloses no congressional intent to criminalize the activity at issue.  Under the Constitution, Congress speaks through duly enacted bills and resolutions;  as to legislation, there is no requirement that Congress memorialize anything, much less its intent, through unenacted non-statutory materials.  Accordingly, Congress's failure to do so can hardly be cited as proof of a defendant's argument that it lacked fair notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also disagree with Bohai's analytical premise.  On an appeal like this one, the issue is simply whether the statute, as enacted by Congress, gave sufficient notice that the conduct charged was proscribed.  Once we have determined that the statute is constitutionally sufficient, our analysis ends.  Bohai seeks to go a step farther and create uncertainty by referring to wholly extraneous matters.  We are not so easily distracted.  Thus, Bohai's exhaustive treatment of the Customs Service regulation, appearing at 19 C.F.R. Sec. 133.21(c)(3), is also unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we conclude that the language of 18 U.S.C.

In this case, the motion to dismiss initially challenged all five counts of the indictment and, therefore, the factual allegations contained in the entire indictment were properly before the district court.  On this appeal, we review the motion to dismiss only as to counts one and three (as explained below, pursuant to a plea agreement, the district court granted the government's motion to dismiss the remaining counts).

Bohai's fair notice argument is grounded in its assertion that the Customs Service had routinely admitted trademarked goods produced by \"authorized manufacturers\" without regard to the timing of the manufacture</p>\n        <p>We do not agree with Bohai that Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110, 92 S.Ct. at 2300, supports the broad proposition that the \"administrative practice of the agency principally charged with enforcing Section 2320 is significant in determining whether that section provided fair notice to Bohai.\"   In Grayned, a First Amendment case, the Court stated that, in the absence of an interpretation of the meaning of an anti-noise ordinance from the court below, it would \"extrapolate its allowable meaning ... [by looking to] the words of the ordinance itself, to the interpretations the court below has given to analogous statutes and, perhaps to some degree, to the interpretation of the statute given by those charged with enforcing it.\"  Id.

Thus, agency interpretations might provide some assistance in our own effort to arrive at the meaning of a statute, but they must at least relate to the statute at issue.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 2320 and that it imported goods by means of false or fraudulent practices in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 542.  The principal issue in this appeal is Bohai's argument that Sec. 2320(d) is unconstitutionally vague.  Because we find no such infirmity, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987 and 1988, Bohai<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> arranged for the overseas manufacture of sneakers for the Stride Rite Corporation (\"Stride Rite\"), the owner of the KEDS trademark.  Stride Rite placed two separate orders with Bohai for the manufacture of 100,000 pairs per order of women's canvas vamp oxford (\"CVO\") sneakers bearing the KEDS mark.  Bohai arranged for the shoes to be manufactured at the Qing Dao # 9 Rubber Factory, a government-owned enterprise in the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\").  Stride Rite terminated Bohai's authority to apply the KEDS mark to the shoes in the spring of 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in August 1989, Bohai's president, James L. Bryant, devised a plan to produce CVO sneakers bearing the KEDS mark in the PRC and distribute them in the United States without the knowledge or authorization of Stride Rite.  Bohai arranged for the production of the shoes at the PRC factory.  In September 1989, a United States-based purchaser agreed to buy 100,000 pairs of the shoes but asked for assurances that they were not counterfeit.  A Bohai employee showed the purchaser a purported Stride Rite purchase order for approximately 100,000 pairs of CVO shoes.  However, the purchase order pertained to a separate, previous order of CVO shoes and had nothing to do with the shoes then being sold to the purchaser.  The employee falsely represented that the shoes had been ordered and produced for Stride Rite, but that Stride Rite had rejected them.  In fact, the shoes had not yet been manufactured and Stride Rite had no knowledge of the plan to produce or import them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Qing Dao factory produced the shoes and applied the KEDS mark to them.  Bryant and others took steps to conceal the fact that trademarks had been applied to the shoes without the knowledge or permission of Stride Rite.  In December 1989, Bryant instructed the PRC factory to stamp the shoes then being produced to falsely reflect a production date of 1988.  Documents were also backdated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1990, the counterfeit shoes entered this country through Boston.  The invoice presented to the U.S. Customs Service at the time of entry falsely indicated that the shoes had been manufactured pursuant to a valid Stride Rite purchase order and were intended to be delivered to Stride Rite or its consignee.  After entry, an employee of Bohai directed the shipper to deliver the shoes to a warehouse in Holbrook, Massachusetts, rather than to the Stride Rite warehouse in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  The employee explained to the shipping company that Bohai and Stride Rite were manufacturing the shoes together as a \"joint venture\" and, therefore, Bohai was an agent for Stride Rite.  After the purchaser inspected the shoes, they were delivered to New Jersey, where they were sold to the public as authentic KEDS CVO shoes through a national department store chain.  On March 27, 1990, Bohai received a wire transfer for $410,032 from the purchaser for the 100,000 shoes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 1993, a federal grand jury indicted Bohai, Bryant and Bohai's Treasurer, Herbert Chih-Lun Wang, under one count charging violations of 18 U.S.C.

The district court held a hearing and, in an order dated October 29, 1993, denied the defendants' motion.  Negotiations with the government ensued.  On February 17, 1994, Bohai entered a conditional plea of guilty under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2) to the first and third counts of the indictment, which alleged violations of Secs. 2320 and 542 respectively.  The agreement expressly reserved Bohai's right to seek review of the denial of the motion to dismiss.  The district court then granted the government's motion to dismiss all counts against Bryant and Wang and to dismiss the conspiracy and money laundering counts against Bohai.  Following a sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Bohai to probation and imposed a fine of $100,000 for violations of counts one and three.

Our task, therefore, is to determine whether 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2320 gave Bohai adequate warning that, as alleged in the indictment, \"knowingly [using] counterfeit marks without the authorization of the holder of the right to use such marks\" is unlawful.  Our review is de novo.  See, e.g., United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578199\"><a href=\"/opinion/578199/united-states-v-esperanza-aguilar-aranceta/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Bohai specifically focuses on the word \"production,\" arguing that it has \"no core meaning\" and that Sec. 2320 leaves the reader helpless \"to understand what aspect of the production process--i.e., creating, bringing about, furnishing, or yielding the goods in question--is relevant in dating the existence of generalized authority to use the mark on goods of the same type.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bohai's statutory analysis suffers from extreme myopia.  As we have observed in the past, statutes are not enacted on a piecemeal basis and, accordingly, should not be read that way.  See Little People's Sch., Inc. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503436\"><a href=\"/opinion/503436/little-peoples-school-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 573 (1st Cir.1988).  By broadening the focus and examining the phrase \"at the time of manufacture or production\" in the context of the entire authorized-use exception, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503436\"><a href=\"/opinion/503436/little-peoples-school-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> we think </a></span>that Bohai's vagueness challenge cannot be sustained.  Based on the plain language of the statute, we conclude that Congress intended, and made sufficiently plain, that this exception would be limited to those goods or services for which authorization existed during the entire period of production or manufacture.  We focus on Congress's statement that authorization must exist \"at the time of the manufacture or production in question ... for the type of goods or services so manufactured or produced.\"   Though perhaps not a model of the most exacting legislative craftsmanship, we think this language nonetheless makes clear beyond reasonable dispute that the authorization to use the mark must exist \"at the time of,\" that is, from beginning of the production or manufacture up to and including the time at which the goods or services have been finally \"manufactured or produced.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that Bohai could reasonably understand from the statutory language that conduct charged in the indictment was not within the authorized-use exception.  The government charges that Bohai was not authorized to apply the marks to 100,000 pairs of CVO shoes, conduct that falls squarely outside the statute's exception.  Bohai asks us to consider the language in light of the \"undisputed fact\" that, in 1988, it had authority from Stride Rite to assemble raw materials, import sewing machines and molds, and train the Qing Dao workers to produce the KEDS CVO shoes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  For the reasons outlined above, the language of the statute cannot sustain Bohai's assertion that these activities alone constitute \"production\" within the meaning of the authorized-use exception.  While Bohai's activities in 1988 might have been steps in the production process, the statute requires that authorization exist until production is complete.  In short, on these facts, we do not think this language can be reasonably described as ambiguous, much less unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bohai makes the additional and somewhat novel argument that, even if the statute is not vague, Bohai lacked fair notice in light of the legislative history of Sec. 2320 as well as a then-existing Customs Service regulation.  We do not agree.  As to legislative history, Bohai argues that it \"is relevant insofar as it discloses no intention to criminalize the type of conduct at issue.\"   Bohai then presents a lengthy examination of various non-statutory materials.  As a general proposition, when a court finds \"clear meaning in the unvarnished language of the statute, [it is] duty bound to honor that meaning.\"  Baez v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195764\"><a href=\"/opinion/195764/baez-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1994).  Consequently, a court may seldom engage in a boundless exploration of unenacted legislative materials.  See id.;   see also Laracuente v. Chase Manhattan Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533001\"><a href=\"/opinion/533001/elviraida-laracuente-v-the-chase-manhattan-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[A]bsent ambiguity in the statutory language, our inquiry is complete and ends with the plain language of the statute.\").  Bohai's use of nonstatutory materials demonstrates the wisdom of this rule.  Bohai relies upon legislative history for the dubious proposition that it discloses no congressional intent to criminalize the activity at issue.  Under the Constitution, Congress speaks through duly enacted bills and resolutions;  as to legislation, there is no requirement that Congress memorialize anything, much less its intent, through unenacted non-statutory materials.  Accordingly, Congress's failure to do so can hardly be cited as proof of a defendant's argument that it lacked fair notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also disagree with Bohai's analytical premise.  On an appeal like this one, the issue is simply whether the statute, as enacted by Congress, gave sufficient notice that the conduct charged was proscribed.  Once we have determined that the statute is constitutionally sufficient, our analysis ends.  Bohai seeks to go a step farther and create uncertainty by referring to wholly extraneous matters.  We are not so easily distracted.  Thus, Bohai's exhaustive treatment of the Customs Service regulation, appearing at 19 C.F.R. Sec. 133.21(c)(3), is also unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we conclude that the language of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2320 is sufficiently definite so as to give fair notice to Bohai that the conduct alleged in the indictment was proscribed, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In reviewing the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss, we take the factual allegations in the indictment as true.

In this case, the motion to dismiss initially challenged all five counts of the indictment and, therefore, the factual allegations contained in the entire indictment were properly before the district court.  On this appeal, we review the motion to dismiss only as to counts one and three (as explained below, pursuant to a plea agreement, the district court granted the government's motion to dismiss the remaining counts).
