Petitioner Angel Torres-Lopez appeals\r                                 \n\nthe denial of a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255 to vacate\n\nhis judgment of  conviction.  After  carefully reviewing  the\n\nrecord  and the briefs of the parties, we affirm the judgment\n\nof the district court for the reasons stated in its Opinion &amp;\n\nOrder dated July 14, 1994.  We add only two comments.\n\n          1.   On appeal, petitioner avers  that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion  in failing to hold a  hearing on\n\nthe    2255 petition.   First, petitioner did  not raise this\n\nissue below.  In any  event, we do not find any merit  to it.\n\nWhere a    2255 motion  arguably is adequate  on its face,  a\n\nhearing  is  not necessary  if  the  motion is  \"conclusively\n\nrefuted as to the  alleged facts by the files  and records of\n\nthe case.\"  United States v.  DiCarlo, 575 F.2d 952, 954 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 834 (1978) (internal  quotation\r                               \n\nmarks  and citation omitted).   The motion here involves only\n\nthe  application  of certain  principles  of  law to  largely\n\nundisputed  facts.   Thus, the  rule that material  issues of\n\nfact may not be decided without an evidentiary hearing is not\n\napplicable.  See id.   \"Moreover, if the claim is  based upon\r                                \n\nfacts with which the  trial court, through . .  . observation\n\nat trial, is familiar, the court may make findings without an\n\nadditional hearing . . . . \"  Id.\r                                             \n\n          2.    This  brings  us  to  the  second   issue  --\n\npetitioner's assertion  that the district  court judge should\n\nhave recused himself.  Again,  petitioner did not raise  this\n\nclaim below.   The only  basis for this  claim is that  the  \r\r\n\n2255  motion  required  the  judge  to  make  a  new  factual\n\ndetermination on a question  as to which he already  had made\n\nan allegedly erroneous finding.  \"Prior adverse rulings alone\n\ncannot,  of course,  be the  basis for  a motion  to recuse.\"\n\nPanzardi-Alvarez  v. United  States, 879  F.2d 975,  984 (1st\r                                               \n\nCir. 1989), cert. denied,  493 U.S. 1082 (1990).  It  also is\r                                    \n\nnot sufficient  to  merely  allege that  a  judge  is  biased\n\nbecause he had been  involved in petitioner's trial.   Id. at\r                                                                      \n\n985.  Aside from the claim of the allegedly erroneous ruling,\n\npetitioner fails  to present  any facts that  would establish\n\nbias on the  judge's part.  Finally, it is  appropriate for a\n\njudge to determine that a   2255 motion can be denied without\n\na hearing even if he was the judge at trial.  See id.\r                                                                 \n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                    \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
