We accept as true all of the allegations in the complaint\n\nand draw  all reasonable inferences  in favor of  the plaintiffs.\n\nId.\n   \n\n                               II.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          In May 1986, Plaintiff  Ronald J. Senter (\"Senter\") was\n\ndiagnosed  as  infected with  Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (\"HIV\n\npositive\").   In March 1991,  he was diagnosed  as suffering from\n\nAcquired  Immune  Deficiency  Syndrome  (\"AIDS\").    He  died  on\n\nJanuary 17, 1993.\n\n          Senter  was  the  sole  shareholder,  president,  chief\n\nexecutive  director, and  an  employee  of Carparts  Distribution\n\nCenter,   Inc.  (\"Carparts\"),   an  automotive   parts  wholesale\n\ndistributor incorporated in New Hampshire.\n\n          Since 1977, Carparts has been a  participant in a self-\n\nfunded medical reimbursement plan known as Automotive Wholesalers\n\n                               -2-\n\nAssociation  of  New England  Health  Benefit  Plan (\"the  Plan\")\n\noffered by  the defendants  in this case,  Automotive Wholesalers\n\nAssociation of New England,  Inc. (\"AWANE\") and its administering\n\ntrust,  Automotive Wholesalers Association  of New  England, Inc.\n\nInsurance Plan (\"AWANE Plan\").   Senter was enrolled in  the Plan\n\nsince  1977.   In October  1990, AWANE  Plan informed  members of\n\nAWANE,  including Carparts, of its intention to amend the Plan in\n\norder to  limit benefits  for AIDS-related illnesses  to $25,000,\n\neffective January 1,  1991.   Otherwise, lifetime  benefits under\n\nthe Plan were, and are, afforded in the amount of  $1 million per\n\neligible plan member.\n\n          On a number of occasions during and after  1989, Senter\n\nhad several serious  illnesses, many  of which were  HIV or  AIDS\n\nrelated.   Senter directly  submitted claims  for payment  of his\n\nmedical  treatment and  medications to  AWANE and the  AWANE Plan\n\nuntil  spring  or summer  of  1991, when  Carparts  submitted the\n\nclaims on Senter's behalf  because he became too sick  or matters\n\nwere too complicated for him to do so.\n\n          Senter  and  Carparts  (\"plaintiffs\"  or  \"appellants\")\n\nalleged,1  that the Trustees of  the Plan were  aware of Senter's\n\ncondition  at the time the  amendments to the  plan were adopted.\n\nPlaintiffs  claim  that the  cap  on  AIDS-related illnesses  was\n\ninstituted by defendants with knowledge that Senter was diagnosed\n\n                    \n\n1   Following  Senter's death,  Shirley M.  Senter and  Daniel W.\nDirsh  were appointed co-executors for  his estate.   On April 1,\n1993,  the district  court allowed  the  substitution of  the co-\nexecutors for Senter as plaintiffs in this action.\n\n                               -3-\n\nHIV positive,  suffering from  AIDS, and subject  to AIDS-related\n\nmedical  expenses  and that  the  lifetime  cap on  AIDS  related\n\nexpenses  was  instituted in  response  to  Senter's illness  and\n\nrelated  claims that  he had  filed during  the  previous several\n\nmonths.    According  to  plaintiffs, after  Senter  reached  the\n\nlifetime cap on AIDS related illnesses, defendants breached their\n\ncontractual obligation to provide, at a minimum, medical coverage\n\nto Senter for non-AIDS related treatments, by failing, neglecting\n\nor  refusing to make payments  for non-AIDS related  matters in a\n\ncomplete or consistent manner.\n\n          Plaintiffs  brought  this  action  alleging   that  the\n\nlifetime  cap  on  health  benefits for  individuals  with  AIDS,\n\ninstituted by defendants,  represented illegal discrimination  on\n\nthe basis  of  a disability.    Such a  discriminatory  provision\n\nallegedly   rendered  Carparts   responsible   for  payments   to\n\nhealthcare  providers  on  Senter's behalf  and  effectively  put\n\nCarparts   out  of  compliance   with  anti-discrimination  laws,\n\nsubjecting Carparts to potential  liability under N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn.   354-A (\"Section  354-A\"), a state anti-discrimination law,\n\nand  the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"the ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.  \n\n12101, et seq.\n              \n\n          The district court dismissed  all of plaintiffs' claims\n\non July 19, 1993.  This appeal followed.\n\n                               III.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n                 A.  Notice of Proposed Dismissal\n\n                               -4-\n\n          Plaintiffs first contend that  the district court erred\n\nin dismissing  their complaint  without affording them  notice of\n\nthe court's intended dismissal.  We agree.\n\n          Plaintiffs commenced this action in the state courts of\n\nNew Hampshire ten  days before  the ADA became  effective.   They\n\nasserted claims under state law only.  The defendants removed the\n\ncase  to  federal  court claiming  that  the  issues raised  were\n\ngoverned and preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct of 1974, as amended, 29 U.S.C.   1001, et seq. (\"ERISA\").\n                                                  \n\n          At  a  pretrial  conference  on  April  15,  1993,  the\n\ndefendants  indicated  their intention  to  move  to dismiss  the\n\npendent claims, and the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint\n\nto  assert  claims under  the ADA.    The plaintiffs'  motion was\n\ngranted  and  they  amended  their complaint  to  include,  among\n\nothers,  claims alleging violations of  Title I and  Title III of\n\nthe ADA.  42  U.S.C    12112(a), 12182(a).  The  defendants filed\n\nan  objection to the amendment and the district court treated the\n\ndefendants' objection as a  motion to dismiss under Fed.  R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(6).  The court dismissed plaintiffs claims, holding that\n\nneither  Title I nor  Title III of  the ADA applied  to this case\n\nbecause neither defendant, AWANE or AWANE Plan, was an \"employer\"\n\nwith  respect  to plaintiffs  as required  by  Title I,  and that\n\nneither  defendant was  a \"public  accommodation\" as  required by\n\nTitle III.\n\n          Where no motion to dismiss has  been filed, \"a district\n\ncourt may,  in appropriate circumstances, note  the inadequacy of\n\n                               -5-\n\nthe complaint and, on its own initiative, dismiss the  complaint.\n\nYet a  court may  not do  so without  at least giving  plaintiffs\n\nnotice  of the proposed action and  affording them an opportunity\n\nto  address the issue.\"  Literature, Inc. v. Quinn, 482 F.2d 372,\n                                                  \n\n374  (1st  Cir.  1973)  (internal citations  omitted);  see  also\n                                                                 \n\nPavilonis v.  King, 626 F.2d  1075, 1078 &amp; n.6  (1st Cir.), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 449 U.S. 829 (1980).\n      \n\n          Although AWANE filed an objection to plaintiffs' motion\n\nto  amend  the complaint,  and  plaintiffs  filed a  response  to\n\nAWANE's  objection,  neither  filing  addressed  the  substantive\n\nissues regarding  Title I and Title  III of the ADA  on which the\n\ndistrict  court based its dismissal order.  The court also failed\n\nto give plaintiffs any  notice of its proposed dismissal,  or any\n\nopportunity  to respond  to the  perceived shortcomings  in their\n\ncomplaint regarding  their claims  under Title  I  and Title  III\n\nprior to the court's  order dismissing the case pursuant  to Fed.\n\nR. Civ.  P. 12 (b)(6).   The court's failure to  give such notice\n\nalone  justifies reversal of this case.  See Literature, 482 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat 374.   We also find,  however, that the court's  dismissal was\n\nerroneous as a matter of law.  See id.  The district  court erred\n                                      \n\nby  interpreting  Title  I  and  Title III  of  the  ADA  to have\n\nexcessively limited applications.  Questions regarding the proper\n\ninterpretation  of  the  ADA  are   sure  to  arise  on   remand.\n\nTherefore, we feel that timely guidance is appropriate.\n\n                      B.  Title I of the ADA\n\n          Plaintiffs  contend that  the  district court  erred in\n\n                               -6-\n\nfinding that defendants were not \"covered entities\" under Title I\n\nof the ADA.\n\n          Title I of the ADA, entitled \"Employment\" provides:\n\n            No  covered   entity  shall  discriminate\n            against  a  qualified  individual with  a\n            disability[2]  because of  the disability\n            of  such  individual  in  regard  to  job\n            application   procedures,   the   hiring,\n            advancement,  or discharge  of employees,\n            employee compensation,  job training, and\n            other  terms, conditions,  and privileges\n            of employment.\n\n42 U.S.C.   12112(a).\n\n          \"Covered entity\" is defined as \"an employer, employment\n\nagency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee.\"\n\n42 U.S.C.   12111(2).\n\n          As the  district court noted, this  provision \"makes it\n\nunlawful for a  covered entity  to discriminate on  the basis  of\n\ndisability against  a qualified  individual with a  disability in\n\nregard  to, among  other  things, fringe  benefits, available  by\n\nvirtue  of employment, whether or not administered by the covered\n\nentity,\" see 29 C.F.R.    1630.4(f), and \"[h]ealth insurance such\n            \n\nas  that  provided  by  the  defendants  is  considered  a fringe\n\nbenefit.\"  Carparts Distribution Ctr.  v. Automotive Wholesaler's\n                                                                 \n\nAss'n, 826 F. Supp. 583, 585  (D.N.H. 1993).  The district  court\n     \n\nfound, however, that because neither defendant was an employer of\n\nSenter, neither entity qualified as a \"covered entity\" as defined\n\n                    \n\n2   For purposes  of  this appeal,  we assume  that  Senter is  a\n\"qualified   individual  with   a  disability.\"     We   make  no\ndetermination  as to whether  defendants' cap on  benefits in the\npresent case constitutes \"discrimination\" based on a disability.\n\n                               -7-\n\nby the ADA and  therefore neither was subject to  liability under\n\nTitle  I of the ADA.  We believe that the district court erred by\n\ninterpreting  Title I  of the  ADA to  permit suits  only against\n\nemployers  who  discriminate  with   respect  to  the  terms  and\n\nconditions of employment of their own employees.\n\n          In making our determination we look for guidance to the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C.   2000-e, et seq.\n                                                                 \n\n(\"Title VII\") and cases  interpreting that statute.  There  is no\n\nsignificant  difference  between  the   definition  of  the  term\n\n\"employer\" in the  two statutes.   Compare 42  U.S.C.    2000e(b)\n                                          \n\n(Title  VII)   with  42  U.S.C.      12111(5)(A)  (ADA).3     The\n                   \n\nInterpretive Guidance on  Title I  of the ADA,  published by  the\n\n                    \n\n3  Title VII provides:\n\n            The  term  \"employer\"   means  a   person\n            engaged in an industry affecting commerce\n            who  has  fifteen or  more  employees for\n            each working  day in  each  of twenty  or\n            more calendar  weeks  in the  current  or\n            preceding  calendar  year, and any  agent\n            of such a person . . . except that during\n            the  first  year  after  March  24, 1972,\n            persons  having  fewer  than  twenty-five\n            employees (and their agents) shall not be\n            considered employers.\n\n42 U.S.C.   2000(e)(b).\n\nThe term \"employer\" is defined in the ADA as:\n\n            A person engaged in an industry affecting\n            commerce who has 25 or more employees for\n            each working  day in  each of 20  or more\n            calendar   weeks   in   the  current   or\n            preceding calendar year, and any agent of\n            such person.\n\n42 U.S.C.   12111(5)(A).\n\n                               -8-\n\nEqual  Employment  Opportunity  Commission (\"EEOC\"),  establishes\n\nthat  the term \"employer\" is \"to be  given the same meaning under\n\nthe  ADA that  [it is]  given under  Title VII.\"4   56  Fed.

Relevant to\n\nthis inquiry is whether defendants had the authority to determine\n\nthe  level  of benefits  that  would  be  provided  to  Carparts'\n\nemployees and whether alternative  health plans were available to\n\nemployees through their employment  with Carparts.

See id.

Where  alternative  health  plans  are\navailable,  it could not be said  that defendants controlled this\naspect of  the employment relationship and  therefore, they would\nnot be deemed \"employers\" under this rationale.\n\n                               -11-\n\nintertwined  as to  be  acting  together  as an  \"employer\"  with\n\nrespect  to  health care  benefits.

A  number of cases, although  not in this\n\ncircuit, have  interpreted analogous  provisions of Title  VII to\n\napply to actions taken by a defendant against  a plaintiff who is\n\nnot  technically an employee of  that employer.   For example, in\n\nSibley  Memorial Hospital v.  Wilson, 488  F.2d 1338,  1341 (D.C.\n                                    \n\nCir.  1973),  the court  applied Title  VII  to a  hospital which\n\nrefused  to assign a private  male nurse to  female patients even\n\nthough  the nurse was technically not an employee of the hospital\n\nbut was an employee  of a particular patient.  We  do not want to\n\nbe understood as  holding at  this time that  there is  automatic\n\ncoverage wherever one who is an employer of a requisite number of\n\npersons takes  some action that  affects the employee  of another\n\nentity; a great deal  may depend on circumstances.   At the  same\n\ntime, we think it premature to rule out the possibility that when\n\nadditional facts are developed,  a claim under Title I  analogous\n\nto that in  Sibley might be  made out.

On remand,  plaintiffs should\n\nbe  given  an  opportunity to  address  this  issue  so that  the\n\ndistrict court can make a determination as to defendants' Title I\n\nstatus.8\n\n                     C.

Our  view, however,  is that  in the\npresent procedural circumstances the opportunity should have been\ngiven to flesh out the complaint with more  detailed allegations.\nIf on  remand the plaintiffs  are unwilling or  unable to do  so,\nthat will be a quite different matter.\n\n                               -14-\n\naccommodations  of an  entity.  42  U.S.C.   12182(b);  28 C.F.R.\n\n  36.202.\n\n          The  district   court  interpreted  the   term  \"public\n\naccommodation\"  as \"being limited  to actual  physical structures\n\nwith  definite  physical  boundaries  which  a  person physically\n\nenters for the purpose  of utilizing the facilities or  obtaining\n\nservices therein.\"  Because  the court found that neither  of the\n\ndefendants possessed those characteristics, it dismissed Senter's\n\nTitle  III claim.   Plaintiffs  contend that  the district  court\n\nerred  in finding  that Title  III of  the ADA  did not  apply to\n\ndefendants because they were not places of \"public accommodation\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the Act.\n\n          Whether  establishments  of \"public  accommodation\" are\n\nlimited to  actual  physical structures  is a  question of  first\n\nimpression  in this Circuit.   For the following  reasons we find\n\nthat they are not so limited and remand to the  district court to\n\nallow  plaintiffs  the  opportunity  to adduce  further  evidence\n\nsupporting their view  that the defendants are  places of \"public\n\naccommodation\" within the meaning of Title III of the ADA.\n\n          We begin our analysis by looking at the language of the\n\nstatute.   Sierra Club v.  Larson, 2 F.3d  462, 467 (1993).   The\n                                 \n\ndefinition of \"public accommodation\" states that \"[t]he following\n\nprivate   entities  are  considered   public  accommodations  for\n\npurposes of this subchapter,  if the operations of such  entities\n\naffect commerce-\"  and then  provides an illustrative  list which\n\nincludes  a \"travel service,\" a \"shoe repair service,\" an \"office\n\n                               -15-\n\nof  an   accountant,  or   lawyer,\"  an  \"insurance   office,\"  a\n\n\"professional  office  of  a  healthcare  provider,\"  and  \"other\n\nservice establishment[s]\".  42 U.S.C.   12181(7)(f).9   The plain\n\nmeaning of the  terms do not  require \"public accommodations\"  to\n\nhave  physical  structures for  persons to  enter.   Even  if the\n\nmeaning  of \"public accommodation\" is not plain, it is, at worst,\n\nambiguous.   This  ambiguity,  considered  together  with  agency\n\nregulations  and public  policy concerns,  persuades us  that the\n\nphrase is not limited to actual physical structures. \n\n          By  including  \"travel  service\"  among   the  list  of\n\nservices  considered  \"public  accommodations,\" Congress  clearly\n\ncontemplated that  \"service establishments\" include  providers of\n\nservices which do  not require  a person to  physically enter  an\n\nactual physical structure.  Many travel services conduct business\n\nby telephone or correspondence  without requiring their customers\n\nto enter an office in order  to obtain their services.  Likewise,\n\none   can  easily   imagine  the   existence  of   other  service\n\nestablishments conducting  business  by mail  and  phone  without\n\nproviding  facilities for  their customers to  enter in  order to\n\nutilize  their services.  It would be irrational to conclude that\n\npersons who enter an office to purchase services are protected by\n\nthe  ADA, but  persons who  purchase the  same services  over the\n\ntelephone or by  mail are not.  Congress  could not have intended\n\nsuch an absurd result.\n\n                    \n\n9    The defendants  are private  entities  that operate  a self-\ninsured  plan.   They  have  not  disputed  that their  operation\naffects commerce.\n\n                               -16-\n\n          Our   interpretation  is   also  consistent   with  the\n\nlegislative  history of the  ADA.  The  purpose of the  ADA is to\n\n\"invoke  the sweep of  Congressional authority . .  . in order to\n\naddress  the major  areas of  discrimination faced  day-to-day by\n\npeople with  disabilities,\"  42 U.S.C    12101(b).   The ADA  was\n\nenacted to  \"provide a  clear and comprehensive  national mandate\n\nfor the  elimination of  discrimination against individuals  with\n\ndisabilities.\"   42 U.S.C.    12101(b)(1).  The  purpose of Title\n\nIII of the ADA,  is \"to bring individuals with  disabilities into\n\nthe economic  and social mainstream of  American life . .  . in a\n\nclear,  balanced, and  reasonable manner.\"   H.R.  Rep. No.  485,\n\n101st  Cong., 2d Sess.,  pt. 2, at  99 (1990), reprinted  in 1990\n                                                            \n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 381.   In drafting Title III, Congress intended\n\nthat people with disabilities  have equal access to the  array of\n\ngoods  and services  offered by  private establishments  and made\n\navailable to  those who do  not have  disabilities.  S.  Rep. No.\n\n116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. at 58 (1989).\n\n          Beyond our threshold determination, we must  tread with\n\ncare.  Some of the critical language of Title III is both general\n\nand ambiguous--for  example, a key provision  concerns the denial\n\nbased  on a disability \"of  the opportunity of  the individual or\n\nclass  to participate  in or  benefit from  the  goods, services,\n\nfacilities,  privileges,  advantages,  or  accommodations  of  an\n\nentity.\"  42  U.S.C.    12182(b)(1)(A)(1).  As  a matter of  bare\n\nlanguage, one could spend some time arguing about whether this is\n\nintended  merely to provide access to whatever product or service\n\n                               -17-\n\nthe subject entity may offer, or is intended in addition to shape\n\nand  control which products and services may be offered.  Indeed,\n\nthere may be areas in which a sharp distinction between these two\n\nconcepts is illusory.\n\n          One who  simply reads the  Committee Report  describing\n\nthe  operations  of Title  III could  easily  come away  with the\n\nimpression  that  it is  primarily concerned  with access  in the\n\nsense  of   either  physical   access  to  a   place  of   public\n\naccommodation  or something  analogous, such  as access  provided\n\nthrough telephone lines, messengers or some other medium.  At the\n\nsame  time, there  is  nothing in  that  history that  explicitly\n\nprecludes an extension of the statute to the substance of what is\n\nbeing  offered.  Suppose, for  example, a company  that makes and\n\ndistributes tools provides easy access to its  retail outlets for\n\npersons  with every kind of disability, but declines to make even\n\nminor adjustments in the design of  the tools to make them usable\n\nby persons with only quite limited disabilities.\n\n          The statute's treatment of  insurance is a good example\n\nof these ambiguities.  On the one hand, the ADA carves out a safe\n\nharbor  of  sorts for  anyone who  is  \"an insurer,  hospital, or\n\nmedical service  company, health maintenance organization, or any\n\nagent,  or  entity that  administers  benefit  plans, or  similar\n\norganizations . . . .\" 42 U.S.C.   12201(c)(1).  See also id.  at\n                                                             \n\n(c)(2),  (3).  One might  initially suppose that  this is because\n\nTitle III would  otherwise cover the  substance of the  insurance\n\nplans.   However,  there is  some  indication in  the legislative\n\n                               -18-\n\nhistory that the industry received this exemption not because its\n\npolicies would  otherwise be substantively regulated  under Title\n\nIII, but  because \"there is  some uncertainty  over the  possible\n\ninterpretations of the language contained in titles I, II and III\n\nas it  applies to insurance .  . . .\"   See S. Rep.  No. 116, 101\n                                           \n\nCong., 1st Sess. at 84 (1989).\n\n          We think that at this  stage it is unwise to  go beyond\n\nthe  possibility that the plaintiff  may be able  to develop some\n                \n\nkind of  claim under  Title III  even though this  may be  a less\n\npromising vehicle in the present case than Title I.  Not only the\n\nfacts but, as we have already noted, even the factual allegations\n\nare quite sparse.  In addition, because of our resolution of  the\n\nTitle I  claims, this  case must  be remanded  and is subject  to\n\nfurther proceedings  regardless of  whether Title III  remains in\n\nthe  case.   While  it is  tempting  to seek  to  provide further\n\nguidance, the  nature of the  record and  the way the  issues are\n\naddressed in the appellate briefs make it imprudent to do so.\n\n          Neither Title III nor its implementing regulations make\n\nany mention of physical boundaries or physical entry.  Many goods\n\nand  services are  sold  over  the  telephone  or  by  mail  with\n\ncustomers never physically entering  the premises of a commercial\n\nentity to purchase the goods or services.   To exclude this broad\n\ncategory of businesses from the reach of Title III and limit  the\n\napplication  of Title  III to  physical structures  which persons\n\nmust  enter to obtain  goods and services would  run afoul of the\n\npurposes  of  the ADA  and  would  severely frustrate  Congress's\n\n                               -19-\n\nintent that individuals with  disabilities fully enjoy the goods,\n\nservices, privileges and  advantages, available  indiscriminately\n\nto other members of the general public.\n\n                               IV.\n\n                          MISCELLANEOUS\n                                       \n\n          Plaintiffs also alleged a  violation of N.H.

Because the\n\ndistrict court found that the ADA did not apply to defendants, it\n\nreasoned that no disruption  in the enforcement of the  ADA would\n\nresult by holding  that Section  354-A is preempted.   The  court\n\nthen  found Section  354-A  preempted by  ERISA  with respect  to\n\n                    \n\n10   Plaintiffs claimed that  Senter, being afflicted  with AIDS,\nwas  a member  of a  discrete and  insular minority  deserving of\nprotected class status  under 42 U.S.C.    1985(3).   Plaintiffs'\nSection   1985  claim  alleged   that  defendants   conspired  to\ndiscriminate against Senter through the institution of a lifetime\ncap on AIDS-related medical benefits.\n\n   The district  court noted that under  section 1985(3) \"[t]here\nmust   be   some  racial,   or  perhaps   otherwise  class-based,\ninvidiously  discriminatory  animus   behind  the   conspirators'\naction\"  and   that  appellants   \"must  identify  a   source  of\ncongressional power to  reach the private conspiracy alleged. . .\n.\"  Carparts  Distribution Ctr.,  826 F. Supp.  at 587  (internal\n                               \nquotations and citations omitted).\n\n   Because  the district  court  ruled that  defendants were  not\nprotected  by  either the  employment  provisions  or the  public\naccommodation  provisions  of  the  ADA, it  further  found  that\nappellants failed to identify a source of congressional  power to\nreach  the   private  conspiracy  they   alleged  and  therefore,\ndismissed their complaint.\n\n                               -20-\n\nplaintiffs' cause of action.\n\n          The district  court's decision to dismiss  these claims\n\nwas based  primarily on its  finding that neither  the employment\n\nprovisions  nor the  public accommodation  provisions of  the ADA\n\napplied to defendants.

Senter (\"Senter\") was\n\ndiagnosed  as  infected with  Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (\"HIV\n\npositive\").   In March 1991,  he was diagnosed  as suffering from\n\nAcquired  Immune  Deficiency  Syndrome  (\"AIDS\").    He  died  on\n\nJanuary 17, 1993.\n\n          Senter  was  the  sole  shareholder,  president,  chief\n\nexecutive  director, and  an  employee  of Carparts  Distribution\n\nCenter,   Inc.  (\"Carparts\"),   an  automotive   parts  wholesale\n\ndistributor incorporated in New Hampshire.\n\n          Since 1977, Carparts has been a  participant in a self-\n\nfunded medical reimbursement plan known as Automotive Wholesalers\n\n                               -2-\n\nAssociation  of  New England  Health  Benefit  Plan (\"the  Plan\")\n\noffered by  the defendants  in this case,  Automotive Wholesalers\n\nAssociation of New England,  Inc. (\"AWANE\") and its administering\n\ntrust,  Automotive Wholesalers Association  of New  England, Inc.\n\nInsurance Plan (\"AWANE Plan\").   Senter was enrolled in  the Plan\n\nsince  1977.   In October  1990, AWANE  Plan informed  members of\n\nAWANE,  including Carparts, of its intention to amend the Plan in\n\norder to  limit benefits  for AIDS-related illnesses  to $25,000,\n\neffective January 1,  1991.   Otherwise, lifetime  benefits under\n\nthe Plan were, and are, afforded in the amount of  $1 million per\n\neligible plan member.\n\n          On a number of occasions during and after  1989, Senter\n\nhad several serious  illnesses, many  of which were  HIV or  AIDS\n\nrelated.   Senter directly  submitted claims  for payment  of his\n\nmedical  treatment and  medications to  AWANE and the  AWANE Plan\n\nuntil  spring  or summer  of  1991, when  Carparts  submitted the\n\nclaims on Senter's behalf  because he became too sick  or matters\n\nwere too complicated for him to do so.\n\n          Senter  and  Carparts  (\"plaintiffs\"  or  \"appellants\")\n\nalleged,1  that the Trustees of  the Plan were  aware of Senter's\n\ncondition  at the time the  amendments to the  plan were adopted.\n\nPlaintiffs  claim  that the  cap  on  AIDS-related illnesses  was\n\ninstituted by defendants with knowledge that Senter was diagnosed\n\n                    \n\n1   Following  Senter's death,  Shirley M.  Senter and  Daniel W.\nDirsh  were appointed co-executors for  his estate.   On April 1,\n1993,  the district  court allowed  the  substitution of  the co-\nexecutors for Senter as plaintiffs in this action.\n\n                               -3-\n\nHIV positive,  suffering from  AIDS, and subject  to AIDS-related\n\nmedical  expenses  and that  the  lifetime  cap on  AIDS  related\n\nexpenses  was  instituted in  response  to  Senter's illness  and\n\nrelated  claims that  he had  filed during  the  previous several\n\nmonths.    According  to  plaintiffs, after  Senter  reached  the\n\nlifetime cap on AIDS related illnesses, defendants breached their\n\ncontractual obligation to provide, at a minimum, medical coverage\n\nto Senter for non-AIDS related treatments, by failing, neglecting\n\nor  refusing to make payments  for non-AIDS related  matters in a\n\ncomplete or consistent manner.\n\n          Plaintiffs  brought  this  action  alleging   that  the\n\nlifetime  cap  on  health  benefits for  individuals  with  AIDS,\n\ninstituted by defendants,  represented illegal discrimination  on\n\nthe basis  of  a disability.    Such a  discriminatory  provision\n\nallegedly   rendered  Carparts   responsible   for  payments   to\n\nhealthcare  providers  on  Senter's behalf  and  effectively  put\n\nCarparts   out  of  compliance   with  anti-discrimination  laws,\n\nsubjecting Carparts to potential  liability under N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn.   354-A (\"Section  354-A\"), a state anti-discrimination law,\n\nand  the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"the ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.  \n\n12101, et seq.\n              \n\n          The district court dismissed  all of plaintiffs' claims\n\non July 19, 1993.  This appeal followed.\n\n                               III.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n                 A.  Notice of Proposed Dismissal\n\n                               -4-\n\n          Plaintiffs first contend that  the district court erred\n\nin dismissing  their complaint  without affording them  notice of\n\nthe court's intended dismissal.  We agree.\n\n          Plaintiffs commenced this action in the state courts of\n\nNew Hampshire ten  days before  the ADA became  effective.   They\n\nasserted claims under state law only.  The defendants removed the\n\ncase  to  federal  court claiming  that  the  issues raised  were\n\ngoverned and preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct of 1974, as amended, 29 U.S.C.   1001, et seq. (\"ERISA\").\n                                                  \n\n          At  a  pretrial  conference  on  April  15,  1993,  the\n\ndefendants  indicated  their intention  to  move  to dismiss  the\n\npendent claims, and the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint\n\nto  assert  claims under  the ADA.    The plaintiffs'  motion was\n\ngranted  and  they  amended  their complaint  to  include,  among\n\nothers,  claims alleging violations of  Title I and  Title III of\n\nthe ADA.  42  U.S.C    12112(a), 12182(a).  The  defendants filed\n\nan  objection to the amendment and the district court treated the\n\ndefendants' objection as a  motion to dismiss under Fed.  R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(6).  The court dismissed plaintiffs claims, holding that\n\nneither  Title I nor  Title III of  the ADA applied  to this case\n\nbecause neither defendant, AWANE or AWANE Plan, was an \"employer\"\n\nwith  respect  to plaintiffs  as required  by  Title I,  and that\n\nneither  defendant was  a \"public  accommodation\" as  required by\n\nTitle III.\n\n          Where no motion to dismiss has  been filed, \"a district\n\ncourt may,  in appropriate circumstances, note  the inadequacy of\n\n                               -5-\n\nthe complaint and, on its own initiative, dismiss the  complaint.\n\nYet a  court may  not do  so without  at least giving  plaintiffs\n\nnotice  of the proposed action and  affording them an opportunity\n\nto  address the issue.\"  Literature, Inc. v.

No individual shall\n                   General Rule\n            be  discriminated against on the basis of\n            disability   in   the   full  and   equal\n            enjoyment   of   the   goods,   services,\n            facilities,  privileges,  advantages,  or\n            accommodations  of  any  place of  public\n            accommodation  by  any  person who  owns,\n            leases  (or leases  to),  or  operates  a\n            place of public accommodation.\n\n42 U.S.C.   12182(a).\n\n          Prohibited discrimination under Title III  includes the\n\ndenial,   on  the  basis of  disability,  of the  opportunity  to\n\nbenefit  from  the  goods, services,  privileges,  advantages  or\n\n                    \n\n8   We recognize defendants' claim  that a number  of the factual\nallegations advanced  in the briefs supporting the appeal are not\nalleged in  the complaint.   Our  view, however,  is that  in the\npresent procedural circumstances the opportunity should have been\ngiven to flesh out the complaint with more  detailed allegations.\nIf on  remand the plaintiffs  are unwilling or  unable to do  so,\nthat will be a quite different matter.\n\n                               -14-\n\naccommodations  of an  entity.  42  U.S.C.   12182(b);  28 C.F.R.\n\n  36.202.\n\n          The  district   court  interpreted  the   term  \"public\n\naccommodation\"  as \"being limited  to actual  physical structures\n\nwith  definite  physical  boundaries  which  a  person physically\n\nenters for the purpose  of utilizing the facilities or  obtaining\n\nservices therein.\"  Because  the court found that neither  of the\n\ndefendants possessed those characteristics, it dismissed Senter's\n\nTitle  III claim.   Plaintiffs  contend that  the district  court\n\nerred  in finding  that Title  III of  the ADA  did not  apply to\n\ndefendants because they were not places of \"public accommodation\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the Act.\n\n          Whether  establishments  of \"public  accommodation\" are\n\nlimited to  actual  physical structures  is a  question of  first\n\nimpression  in this Circuit.   For the following  reasons we find\n\nthat they are not so limited and remand to the  district court to\n\nallow  plaintiffs  the  opportunity  to adduce  further  evidence\n\nsupporting their view  that the defendants are  places of \"public\n\naccommodation\" within the meaning of Title III of the ADA.\n\n          We begin our analysis by looking at the language of the\n\nstatute.   Sierra Club v.  Larson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194858\"><a href=\"/opinion/194858/sierra-club-v-larson/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (1993).   The\n                                 \n\ndefinition of \"public accommodation\" states that \"[t]he following\n\nprivate   entities  are  considered   public  accommodations  for\n\npurposes of this subchapter,  if the operations of such  entities\n\naffect commerce-\"  and then  provides an illustrative  list which\n\nincludes  a \"travel service,\" a \"shoe repair service,\" an \"office\n\n                               -15-\n\nof  an   accountant,  or   lawyer,\"  an  \"insurance   office,\"  a\n\n\"professional  office  of  a  healthcare  provider,\"  and  \"other\n\nservice establishment[s]\".  42 U.S.C.   12181(7)(f).9   The plain\n\nmeaning of the  terms do not  require \"public accommodations\"  to\n\nhave  physical  structures for  persons to  enter.   Even  if the\n\nmeaning  of \"public accommodation\" is not plain, it is, at worst,\n\nambiguous.   This  ambiguity,  considered  together  with  agency\n\nregulations  and public  policy concerns,  persuades us  that the\n\nphrase is not limited to actual physical structures. \n\n          By  including  \"travel  service\"  among   the  list  of\n\nservices  considered  \"public  accommodations,\" Congress  clearly\n\ncontemplated that  \"service establishments\" include  providers of\n\nservices which do  not require  a person to  physically enter  an\n\nactual physical structure.  Many travel services conduct business\n\nby telephone or correspondence  without requiring their customers\n\nto enter an office in order  to obtain their services.  Likewise,\n\none   can  easily   imagine  the   existence  of   other  service\n\nestablishments conducting  business  by mail  and  phone  without\n\nproviding  facilities for  their customers to  enter in  order to\n\nutilize  their services.  It would be irrational to conclude that\n\npersons who enter an office to purchase services are protected by\n\nthe  ADA, but  persons who  purchase the  same services  over the\n\ntelephone or by  mail are not.  Congress  could not have intended\n\nsuch an absurd result.\n\n                    \n\n9    The defendants  are private  entities  that operate  a self-\ninsured  plan.   They  have  not  disputed  that their  operation\naffects commerce.\n\n                               -16-\n\n          Our   interpretation  is   also  consistent   with  the\n\nlegislative  history of the  ADA.  The  purpose of the  ADA is to\n\n\"invoke  the sweep of  Congressional authority . .  . in order to\n\naddress  the major  areas of  discrimination faced  day-to-day by\n\npeople with  disabilities,\"  42 U.S.C    12101(b).   The ADA  was\n\nenacted to  \"provide a  clear and comprehensive  national mandate\n\nfor the  elimination of  discrimination against individuals  with\n\ndisabilities.\"   42 U.S.C.    12101(b)(1).  The  purpose of Title\n\nIII of the ADA,  is \"to bring individuals with  disabilities into\n\nthe economic  and social mainstream of  American life . .  . in a\n\nclear,  balanced, and  reasonable manner.\"   H.R.  Rep. No.  485,\n\n101st  Cong., 2d Sess.,  pt. 2, at  99 (1990), reprinted  in 1990\n                                                            \n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 381.   In drafting Title III, Congress intended\n\nthat people with disabilities  have equal access to the  array of\n\ngoods  and services  offered by  private establishments  and made\n\navailable to  those who do  not have  disabilities.  S.  Rep. No.\n\n116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. at 58 (1989).\n\n          Beyond our threshold determination, we must  tread with\n\ncare.  Some of the critical language of Title III is both general\n\nand ambiguous--for  example, a key provision  concerns the denial\n\nbased  on a disability \"of  the opportunity of  the individual or\n\nclass  to participate  in or  benefit from  the  goods, services,\n\nfacilities,  privileges,  advantages,  or  accommodations  of  an\n\nentity.\"  42  U.S.C.    12182(b)(1)(A)(1).  As  a matter of  bare\n\nlanguage, one could spend some time arguing about whether this is\n\nintended  merely to provide access to whatever product or service\n\n                               -17-\n\nthe subject entity may offer, or is intended in addition to shape\n\nand  control which products and services may be offered.  Indeed,\n\nthere may be areas in which a sharp distinction between these two\n\nconcepts is illusory.\n\n          One who  simply reads the  Committee Report  describing\n\nthe  operations  of Title  III could  easily  come away  with the\n\nimpression  that  it is  primarily concerned  with access  in the\n\nsense  of   either  physical   access  to  a   place  of   public\n\naccommodation  or something  analogous, such  as access  provided\n\nthrough telephone lines, messengers or some other medium.  At the\n\nsame  time, there  is  nothing in  that  history that  explicitly\n\nprecludes an extension of the statute to the substance of what is\n\nbeing  offered.  Suppose, for  example, a company  that makes and\n\ndistributes tools provides easy access to its  retail outlets for\n\npersons  with every kind of disability, but declines to make even\n\nminor adjustments in the design of  the tools to make them usable\n\nby persons with only quite limited disabilities.\n\n          The statute's treatment of  insurance is a good example\n\nof these ambiguities.  On the one hand, the ADA carves out a safe\n\nharbor  of  sorts for  anyone who  is  \"an insurer,  hospital, or\n\nmedical service  company, health maintenance organization, or any\n\nagent,  or  entity that  administers  benefit  plans, or  similar\n\norganizations . . . .\" 42 U.S.C.   12201(c)(1).  See also </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194858\"><a href=\"/opinion/194858/sierra-club-v-larson/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  at\n                                                             \n\n(c)(2), </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3).  One might  initially suppose that  this is because\n\nTitle III would  otherwise cover the  substance of the  insurance\n\nplans.   However,  there is  some  indication in  the legislative\n\n                               -18-\n\nhistory that the industry received this exemption not because its\n\npolicies would  otherwise be substantively regulated  under Title\n\nIII, but  because \"there is  some uncertainty  over the  possible\n\ninterpretations of the language contained in titles I, II and III\n\nas it  applies to insurance .  . . .\"   See S. Rep.  No. 116, 101\n                                           \n\nCong., 1st Sess. at 84 (1989).\n\n          We think that at this  stage it is unwise to  go beyond\n\nthe  possibility that the plaintiff  may be able  to develop some\n                \n\nkind of  claim under  Title III  even though this  may be  a less\n\npromising vehicle in the present case than Title I.  Not only the\n\nfacts but, as we have already noted, even the factual allegations\n\nare quite sparse.  In addition, because of our resolution of  the\n\nTitle I  claims, this  case must  be remanded  and is subject  to\n\nfurther proceedings  regardless of  whether Title III  remains in\n\nthe  case.   While  it is  tempting  to seek  to  provide further\n\nguidance, the  nature of the  record and  the way the  issues are\n\naddressed in the appellate briefs make it imprudent to do so.\n\n          Neither Title III nor its implementing regulations make\n\nany mention of physical boundaries or physical entry.  Many goods\n\nand  services are  sold  over  the  telephone  or  by  mail  with\n\ncustomers never physically entering  the premises of a commercial\n\nentity to purchase the goods or services.   To exclude this broad\n\ncategory of businesses from the reach of Title III and limit  the\n\napplication  of Title  III to  physical structures  which persons\n\nmust  enter to obtain  goods and services would  run afoul of the\n\npurposes  of  the ADA  and  would  severely frustrate  Congress's\n\n                               -19-\n\nintent that individuals with  disabilities fully enjoy the goods,\n\nservices, privileges and  advantages, available  indiscriminately\n\nto other members of the general public.\n\n                               IV.\n\n                          MISCELLANEOUS\n                                       \n\n          Plaintiffs also alleged a  violation of N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn.   354(A), referred  to as the \"Law  Against Discrimination,\"\n\nand  of the  Civil Rights  Act of  1965, 42  U.S.C.    1985(3).10\n\nPlaintiffs  claimed  in the  district  court  that Section  354-A\n\nserves as an  enforcement vehicle for the ADA and for that reason\n\nshould not  be preempted by ERISA, 29 U.S.C.   1144.  Because the\n\ndistrict court found that the ADA did not apply to defendants, it\n\nreasoned that no disruption  in the enforcement of the  ADA would\n\nresult by holding  that Section  354-A is preempted.   The  court\n\nthen  found Section  354-A  preempted by  ERISA  with respect  to\n\n                    \n\n10   Plaintiffs claimed that  Senter, being afflicted  with AIDS,\nwas  a member  of a  discrete and  insular minority  deserving of\nprotected class status  under 42 U.S.C.    1985(3).   Plaintiffs'\nSection   1985  claim  alleged   that  defendants   conspired  to\ndiscriminate against Senter through the institution of a lifetime\ncap on AIDS-related medical benefits.\n\n   The district  court noted that under  section 1985(3) \"[t]here\nmust   be   some  racial,   or  perhaps   otherwise  class-based,\ninvidiously  discriminatory  animus   behind  the   conspirators'\naction\"  and   that  appellants   \"must  identify  a   source  of\ncongressional power to  reach the private conspiracy alleged. . .\n.\"  Carparts  Distribution </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523823\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ctr.,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/1523823/carparts-distrib-ctr-v-automotive-wholesalers/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
