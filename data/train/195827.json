Counts I  and II charge separate  carjackings,\n\nin  violation of  18 U.S.C.    2119, and  Count III  charges that\n\nRamirez used or carried a firearm during crimes of violence, viz.\r                                                                          \n\nthe carjackings alleged in  Counts I and II,  in violation of  18\n\nU.S.C.   924(c).  Ramirez claims  that the government may not try\n\nhim on  either Count  I or  Count II  and on  Count III,  without\r                                                   \n\nviolating the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Consti-\n\ntution, because the identical evidential elements are required to\n\nestablish  a carjacking charge and the   924(c) violation charged\n\nin Count  III.1  After denying  the motion to dismiss  Count III,\n\nthe district court  stayed further proceedings pending  an inter-\n\nlocutory appeal.\n\n          The Supreme Court  has admonished that the  final judg-\n\nment rule,  see 28 U.S.C.    1291, \"is strongest in  the criminal\r                         \n\ncontext,\" Flanagan v.

See Cohen  v.

United States  v. Rivera-Martinez,  931 F.2d 148,  152\r                                                      \n\n(1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  112 S. Ct.  184 (1991)  (citing North\r                                                                           \n\nCarolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969)).  The Supreme Court\r                            \n\nheld in Abney  that an order denying a pretrial motion to dismiss\r                       \n\nbased on  a claim  of former jeopardy  is immediately  appealable\n\nunder the collateral order doctrine.   Abney, 431 U.S. at 659-61.\r                                                      \n\nThe  Court reasoned  that  only  an  interlocutory  appeal  could\n\nprotect the defendant from the \"strain, public embarrassment, and\n\nexpense of a criminal trial more than once for the same offense.\"\n\nId. at 661.  Abney,  nevertheless, is not carte blanche authority\r                            \n\nfor all interlocutory  appeals brought under the  Double Jeopardy\n\nbanner, since  some such claims  do not meet the  requirements of\n\nthe \"collateral order\"  doctrine.  The interlocutory  order chal-\n\nlenged by Ramirez falls into the latter category, since it simply\n\ndisallowed  a  \"multiple  punishment\"  claim  masquerading  as  a\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n \"former jeopardy\" claim.\n\n          We believe the  Abney branch of the  \"collateral order\"\r                                         \n\nexception to the  final judgment rule is limited  to the \"special\n\ncircumstances  permeating\"  former jeopardy  claims.   Abney, 431\r                                                                      \n\nU.S. at 663 (emphasis added).  \n\n          Ramirez argues that  a simultaneous trial on  Count III\n\nand  Counts I/II  would entail  \"former  jeopardy\" because  these\n\ncounts require identical elements of proof.  However, the Supreme\n\nCourt has  distinguished between  the \"double  jeopardy\" problems\n\nposed  by a  simultaneous trial  and by  successive trials.   See\r                                                                           \n\nUnited States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989).   In a simultaneous\r                                 \n\ntrial, the  multiple punishment  inquiry focuses  on whether  the\n\nlegislature  has  authorized  multiple  punishments,  as  it  may\n\nlawfully do.   Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493, 499-500 (1984).  In\r                                        \n\nsuccessive trials, on the other hand, \"the Double Jeopardy Clause\n\nprotects against the  possibility that the Government  is seeking\n\nthe second punishment  because it is dissatisfied  with the sanc-\n\ntion obtained in the first proceeding.\"  Halper, 490 U.S. at 451,\r                                                         \n\nn.10.  \n\n          The Halper Court foreclosed Ramirez's multiple  punish-\r                              \n\nment  claim.   There, the  Court  held that  a civil  proceeding,\n\npunitive in nature,  which followed a criminal trial  on the same\n\nset of facts, violated the  Double Jeopardy Clause.  Id.  at 448.\r                                                                  \n\nThe Court nevertheless  stated that  its ruling  did not  prevent\n\n\"the  Government from seeking  and obtaining both  the full civil\n\npenalty and  the full  range of  statutorily authorized  criminal\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n penalties in  the same  proceeding.  In  a single  proceeding the\n\nmultiple  punishment issue would be limited  to ensuring that the\n\ntotal  punishment did not exceed  that authorized by the legisla-\n\nture.\"  Id. at 450.\r                     \n\n                                6\r\r\n\n           In United  States v. Sorren,  605 F.2d 1211,  1215 (1st\r                                               \n\nCir.  1979),  we  indicated that  our  analysis  of interlocutory\n\nappellate jurisdiction  turns upon  whether the  implicated right\n\nwas \"incapable of vindication on  appeal.\"  The challenge  raised\n\nin the  instant interlocutory appeal  can be fully  vindicated on\n\nappeal from  a final  judgment of conviction  and sentence.   See\r                                                                           \n\nUnited States v. Abreu, 952  F.2d 1458, 1465 (1st Cir.)

An interlocutory appeal  in the present\r                                    \n\ncase would  not serve the  purposes envisioned in  Abney, because\r                                                                  \n\nRamirez would have to stand trial on the remaining counts even if\n\nCount III  were dismissed.   See United  States v.  McHenry, 1993\r                                                                     \n\nU.S. App. LEXIS 12553, at *2 (6th Cir.

Ramirez claims that the government may not try him on either Count I or Count II and on Count III, without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution, because the identical evidential elements are required to establish a carjacking charge and the Sec. 924(c) violation charged in Count III.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After denying the motion to dismiss Count III, the district court stayed further proceedings pending an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has admonished that the final judgment rule, see 28 U.S.C.
