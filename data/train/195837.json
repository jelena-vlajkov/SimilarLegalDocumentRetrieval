The  appellant Waltham  Housing\r                                      \n\nAuthority   (\"WHA\")  is  a   public  agency  responsible  for\n\nproviding low  income housing in Waltham,  Massachusetts.  In\n\n1987,  appellee  John  J.  Walker  had  served  as  the WHA's\n\nexecutive director  for over  eleven years and  was currently\n\nserving in  this position  under a two-year  written contract\n\ndue  to  expire  on December  31,  1988.   The  WHA  Board of\n\nCommissioners  consisted of five  members, including Chairman\n\nLouis D'Angio and appellant Edward McCarthy.\n\n     In  the  summer of  1987,  the Board  began  a personnel\n\nsearch  to  replace the  WHA's  retiring assistant  executive\n\ndirector.   At a board meeting on August 12, Walker expressed\n\nhis dissatisfaction  with the three finalists  whom the Board\n\nwas considering.  The Board  nevertheless selected one of the\n\nremaining candidates, Walter  McGuire, to fill the  position.\n\n     Believing that his  contract gave him  the final say  on\n\nhiring,  and  angered  by  the Board's  action  in  selecting\n\nMcGuire over his objection, Walker presented Chairmen D'Angio\n\nwith a hastily scribbled letter of  resignation and then left\n\nthe meeting.  The letter read:\n\n     Mr.   Louis   D'Angio   Chairman  Waltham   Housing\n     Authority,  I  hereby  resign  effective  6:50 p.m.\n     Aug. 12, 1987 and will file for retirement Aug. 13,\n     1987.\n\n                         /s/ John J. Walker\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nD'Angio passed the letter around to  the other Board members,\n\nand the Board voted unanimously to table Walker's resignation\n\nfor further consideration.\n\n     Following the  meeting D'Angio,  at the urging  of Board\n\nmembers,  went  to  Walker's  office   to  talk  him  out  of\n\nresigning.    D'Angio  returned  the  resignation  letter  to\n\nWalker, placing it on his desk and telling him that the Board\n\nwanted him  to take  it back.   Walker  said nothing but  (he\n\nlater  testified)  put  the   letter  in  his  shirt  pocket,\n\nbelieving that his resignation  had been rejected.   The next\n\nday  Walker  came into  the office  and  did not  file papers\n\napplying for retirement.   \n\n     The Board  scheduled a special meeting for  August 17 to\n\naddress the  matter of Walker's resignation,  which was still\n\ntabled.   Three days before  the meeting Walker  told D'Angio\n\nthat  he wanted three matters  \"handled\" or \"cleared  up\":  a\n\nmodification  of  the  assistant  executive   director's  job\n\ndescription;  a $2,000  salary adjustment for  Dorothy Boyle,\n\nwho was  an assistant WHA administrator  and Walker's sister-\n\nin-law; and  Board agreement to Walker's  \"strong input\" into\n\nselections  for assistant  executive director  and two  other\n\npositions.   D'Angio asked Walker not to attend the August 17\n\nBoard meeting but to let D'Angio present his position.\n\n     D'Angio  did not tell the Board that he had given Walker\n\nhis  resignation  letter back.    Instead, at  the  August 17\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nmeeting  D'Angio  declared  that  Walker  would  rescind  his\n\nresignation  only   if  the   Board  agreed  to   meet  three\n\nconditions.  The three conditions, presented as nonnegotiable\n\ndemands by  D'Angio, were the same three  matters that Walker\n\nhad  told D'Angio at their  August 14 meeting  that he wanted\n\n\"cleared up.\"   The Board had no  objection to the first  two\n\nconditions, but balked at the third request--Walker's \"strong\n\ninput\" into the Board's selection of the top staff positions.\n\n     Two members  of the  Board, McCarthy and  Joseph Pavone,\n\nwere concerned that Walker wanted the final say on hiring for\n\nthose positions; they  asked if Walker would come  before the\n\nBoard to discuss his  position on this matter.   D'Angio said\n\nthat  the three  conditions  were a  \"take  it or  leave  it\"\n\nproposition and that Walker would not appear to discuss them.\n\nOn McCarthy's motion, the Board then voted to accept Walker's\n\nresignation.   D'Angio joined in  the unanimous vote but then\n\nresigned as  chairman, and  McCarthy was elected  to complete\n\nD'Angio's term.     Afterwards, D'Angio discussed with Alfred\n\nBergin, another  Board member,  the possibility of  calling a\n\nspecial  meeting to \"straighten  the whole matter  out.\"  The\n\nWHA's  bylaws required  the  chairman to  schedule a  special\n\nmeeting  of  the  Board  upon  the  request  of  two members.\n\nD'Angio  believed  that  there  were  at  least  three  Board\n\nmembers--Bergin, Pavone and himself--that could be counted on\n\nto vote for Walker's reinstatement at a special meeting.    \n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     By  letter  dated   September  3,  D'Angio  and   Bergin\n\nrequested  that  McCarthy  schedule  a  special  meeting  for\n\nSeptember 21  to discuss Walker's resignation.   The proposed\n\ndate was significant because it was just before Bergin's term\n\non the Board was slated  to expire on October 1.   The letter\n\nrecommended  that Walker be invited to address the Board.  On\n\nSeptember 9, Walker himself sent a letter to the Board asking\n\nfor   an  opportunity  to   speak  to   them  about   \"a  few\n\nmisunderstandings\" concerning his resignation. \n\n       McCarthy told a subordinate to ask an attorney whether\n\nMcCarthy  had authority to  defer the Board  meeting, and the\n\nattorney said that McCarthy had  authority to select the date\n\nhimself although  the meeting should be held  at the earliest\n\ntime convenient  for all members.   After getting  this legal\n\nadvice, McCarthy put off  the requested meeting until October\n\n7,  six  days  after   Bergin's  departure  from  the  Board.\n\nApparently, the  attorney had no  information about  Bergin's\n\nexpected departure between the two dates.\n\n     McCarthy  later testified  that  he  had  postponed  the\n\nmeeting because of conflicts with his own heavy work schedule\n\nin   September,  but   also   because   he  wanted   Bergin's\n\nreplacement, Henry  Walsh, to consider the  issue of Walker's\n\nresignation; Walsh,  said McCarthy, would be  living with the\n\noutcome  of the  controversy  during his  term on  the Board.\n\nMcCarthy  spoke  with  Walsh  about  the  issue  of  Walker's\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nresignation  before  the  special  meeting,  and  Walsh  told\n\nMcCarthy that he wanted nothing to do with that \"mess.\" \n\n     Walker  appeared  before the  Board  on  October 7,  and\n\nraised the same three  matters that D'Angio had set  forth at\n\nthe  August  17 meeting.    After  hearing from  Walker,  who\n\nrequested his job back,  the Board voted on whether  to waive\n\nits earlier  acceptance of  his resignation and  to reinstate\n\nhim as executive director.  Two members--D'Angio and Pavone--\n\nvoted  for  Walker's  reinstatement,  and  one  member  voted\n\nagainst it.  Henry Walsh, Bergin's  replacement on the Board,\n\nabstained.     Apparently  breaking   with  Board  tradition,\n\nMcCarthy as  chairman then cast  a no vote  to create  a tie,\n\nwhich defeated the motion.\n\n     Walker  filed  suit  against  the WHA  and  McCarthy  on\n\nDecember 23,  1987,  claiming  that  he   had  rescinded  his\n\nresignation prior  to the Board's August  17 meeting, thereby\n\npreventing  the WHA from accepting it.  As later amended, the\n\ncomplaint set forth six counts:\n\n           Count  I, brought  under  42  U.S.C.    1983,\n     alleged that the WHA and McCarthy violated Walker's\n     due  process rights  by terminating  him without  a\n     prior hearing;\n\n           Counts  II  and  III  alleged  that  the  WHA\n     breached Walker's employment  contract and its  own\n     personnel policies;\n\n           Count  IV  alleged  that McCarthy  tortiously\n     interfered with Walker's employment;\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n           Count  V alleged  that McCarthy  violated the\n     Massachusetts Civil Rights Act,  Mass. Gen. L.  ch.\n     12; and\n\n           Count VI sought  a declaratory judgment that,\n     as  a result  of  the  preceding conduct,  Walker's\n     dismissal by the WHA was improper.\n\nWalker   requested   compensatory   and   punitive   damages,\n\nreinstatement, back  pay, attorney's  fees and  various other\n\nforms of equitable relief.   \n\n     On count  I, Walker's  section 1983 claim,  the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment  for McCarthy and for the  WHA\n\n\"with respect to liability for monetary  damages.\"  The court\n\nfound that  McCarthy was  immune from section  1983 liability\n\nbecause, given  D'Angio's statements  to the Board,  McCarthy\n\nwas  entitled  to  vote to  accept  what  he  believed to  be\n\nWalker's still  outstanding resignation  letter.  As  for the\n\nWHA,    the    court    ruled    that    D'Angio's    alleged\n\nmisrepresentations to the Board on August 17 did not make the\n\nWHA   liable  for   damages,   since  D'Angio   lacked  final\n\npolicymaking authority to act  for the WHA to alter  Walker's\n\nemployment status. \n\n     Nevertheless, the district court ruled that Walker might\r                                                                         \n\nstill be able to obtain equitable relief under count I in the\n\nform  of  reinstatement  as  the  WHA's  executive  director.\n\nFraming this issue for trial, the district judge wrote:\n\n     [A]t least in the factual context of this  case, if\n     Walker   can  convince   the  jury   that  he   had\n     unconditionally rescinded his resignation  prior to\n     the  August  17  Board  meeting  and  that  D'Angio\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     misrepresented  that  fact   to  the  Board,   then\n     plaintiff  may  be  entitled  to  reinstatement  as\n     Executive Director.\n\n     Thereafter, the district  court granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of  McCarthy and the  WHA, on counts  II (breach  of\n\ncontract), III  (breach of  personnel policies) and  V (state\n\ncivil  rights claim).  On count  VI (the declaratory judgment\n\nclaim)  the court dismissed \"[t]hose portions . . . having to\n\ndo  with the  counts that  have been  disposed of  on summary\n\njudgment  . . .  .\"   The court  denied summary  judgment for\n\nMcCarthy  on count  IV  (Walker's tortious  interference with\n\nemployment  claim) ruling  that McCarthy enjoyed  no immunity\n\nfrom  intentional torts  under  Massachusetts  law  and  that\n\nWalker  had raised a triable  issue of fact  as to McCarthy's\n\nmotivations in  scheduling the October 7  special meeting and\n\nvoting at that meeting to create a tie.\n\n     This left for trial count I, limited to equitable relief\n\nagainst  WHA,  count  IV  (the  tortious  interference  claim\n\nagainst McCarthy) and  possible declaratory judgment.   After\n\nconferring  with the  parties, the  district judge  entered a\n\npretrial  order.  The parties  agreed that the  case would be\n\ntried, with a  jury, before  a magistrate judge.   They  also\n\nagreed that \"the  only issues to be tried,\" as  framed by the\n\norder, were:\n\n     (a)  Whether  Louis  D'Angio misrepresented  to the\n          Board   of   the  Waltham   Housing  Authority\n          plaintiff's   alleged    revocation   of   his\n          resignation and, if so,\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     (b)  Whether Edward  McCarthy tortiously interfered\n          with plaintiff's employment as the Authority's\n          executive director?\n\n     (c)  The amount  of damages.   Plaintiff claims for\n          back  pay  at  least  to  December  31,  1988,\n          medical  insurance,  life  insurance,  pension\n          benefits, and  the use of an  automobile.  The\n          parties agreed to stipulate the amounts of the\n          separate elements of damages.\n\nThe parties also agreed to bifurcate the trial with issue (a)\n\nto be tried first (\"phase I\"), to be followed by the trial of\n\nissues  (b) and (c) (\"phase  II\"), if necessary,  to the same\n\njury immediately after the verdict on issue (a).\n\n     Thereafter, the defendants moved to strike Walker's jury\n\ntrial demand on phase I, arguing that count I was now limited\n\nto  an equitable remedy triable to the court.  The magistrate\n\njudge denied the  motion, noting  that phase I  of the  trial\n\nencompassed  a  factual  determination--whether   Walker  had\n\nwithdrawn his resignation--that was  common to both  Walker's\n\nequitable claim under count I and his legal claim under count\n\nIV.   The court said this  issue should therefore be tried to\n\nthe  jury,  but the  court  would  ultimately decide  whether\n\nequitable relief was warranted.\n\n     Trial on phase I then proceeded.  The trial evidence has\n\nalready been summarized above in the light  most favorable to\n\nthe verdict.  Hendricks  &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Daewoo  Corp., 923\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  209, 214 (1st  Cir. 1991).   On November 19,  1992, the\n\njury  answered  affirmatively  each of  the  three  questions\n\nsubmitted to it on issue (a):\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     1.    Do  you  find  from a  preponderance  of  the\n     evidence that plaintiff John Walker has proven that\n     he rescinded  or  revoked his  written  resignation\n     prior to the August 17, 1987, board meeting?\n\n     2.    Do  you  find  from  a preponderance  of  the\n     evidence that plaintiff John Walker has proven that\n     the rescission or revocation of his resignation was\n     unconditional?\n\n     3.    Do  you  find  from  a  preponderance of  the\n     evidence that plaintiff has proven that Mr. D'Angio\n     misrepresented to the board on August 17, 1987, the\n     fact that plaintiff  had unconditionally  rescinded\n     or revoked his resignation?\n\n     The  next day  trial proceeded  to phase II,  to address\n\nissues  (b) and  (c)  outlined in  the  pretrial order.    On\n\nNovember  30, the  jury  found that  McCarthy had  tortiously\n\ninterfered with  Walker's employment  at the WHA  and awarded\n\nhim  $79,018.78   in  damages.     The  jury   also  answered\n\naffirmatively the following five questions in phase II:\n\n     1.    Do  you  find  from  a  preponderance of  the\n     evidence   that   plaintiff   had   an   employment\n     relationship with the Waltham Housing Authority?\n\n     2.    Do  you  find  from  a preponderance  of  the\n     evidence that plaintiff  has proven that  defendant\n     McCarthy knew about this relationship?\n\n     3.    Do  you  find  from a  preponderance  of  the\n     evidence that  plaintiff has proven  that defendant\n     McCarthy's  interference,  in  addition   to  being\n     intentional, was malicious?\n\n     4.    Do  you  find  from  a preponderance  of  the\n     evidence that plaintiff has proven that his loss of\n     employment  relationship   directly  resulted  from\n     defendant McCarthy's conduct?\n\n     5.    Do  you  find  from  a  preponderance of  the\n     evidence  that defendant McCarthy  was motivated by\n     actual malice, amounting  to malevolence, spite  or\n     ill will?  \n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n     On April 5, 1993, the magistrate  judge entered an order\n\ndenying Walker reinstatement under count I on the ground that\n\nthe equities  weighed against reinstatement.   The magistrate\n\njudge  initially ordered  back  pay as  equitable relief  and\n\ndeclared  that  Walker's  termination  was  improper  but  on\n\nreconsideration vacated both awards--the former on the ground\n\nthat  it  was foreclosed  by  the  district court's  pretrial\n\nrulings, and the latter  on the ground that the WHA had acted\n\nin  good faith so that the termination could not be described\n\nas improper. \n\n     Final  judgment was entered on August 26, 1993, in favor\n\nof the  WHA and McCarthy on  all claims except count  IV.  On\n\ncount IV judgment was entered for Walker against McCarthy  in\n\nthe amount of $79,018.78.   The court denied Walker's request\n\nfor  attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.    1988, finding that he\n\nwas  not a prevailing party  under that section.   Both sides\n\nhave appealed to this court.\n\n     1.   We first address Walker's challenge to the district\n\ncourt's  rulings  that on  count I  McCarthy was  entitled to\n\nqualified  immunity under  section 1983  and that  under that\n\nsection the  WHA was not  municipally liable for  damages for\n\neither  McCarthy's or  D'Angio's  conduct.   We review  these\n\nsummary  judgment determinations de  novo, Maldonado-Denis v.\r                                                                      \n\nCastillo-Rodriguez,  23 F.3d  576, 581  (1st Cir.  1994), but\r                              \n\nfind no error.\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     In  dismissing  the damage  claims  under  count I,  the\n\ndistrict court held  that on the undisputed facts  Walker had\n\nsubmitted  his resignation  to the  Board and  thereafter had\n\ngiven the Board no  reason to think that the  resignation had\n\nbeen  withdrawn.  We agree that when McCarthy voted on August\n\n17 to accept the resignation, he had  no reason to think that\n\nthe Board  was  firing  Walker or  infringing  upon  any  due\n\nprocess right  that  Walker might  have  to a  prior  hearing\n\nbefore  being involuntarily  dismissed.   Feliciano-Angulo v.\r                                                                      \n\nRivera-Cruz,   858   F.2d   40,   42-44   (1st   Cir.  1988).\r                       \n\nAccordingly, McCarthy had  qualified immunity for  his August\n\n17  actions.   Harlow  v. Fitzgerald,  457  U.S. 800,  815-19\r                                                \n\n(1982).\n\n     Perhaps a municipality might in rare cases be liable for\n\na constitutional violation,  even though  the individual  who\n\nacted for it was  protected by qualified immunity.   See Owen\r                                                                         \n\nv. City of  Independence, 445  U.S. 622, 647  (1980).   But--\r                                    \n\nignoring  the other  requisites for municipal  liability, see\r                                                                         \n\nCity of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112 (1988)--in this\r                                           \n\ncase   it  is  difficult  to   see  how  there   could  be  a\n\nconstitutional violation at all since a majority of the Board\n\nreasonably  thought  that they  had  a  voluntary resignation\n\nbefore them.   See  Stone v.  University of  Maryland Medical\r                                                                         \n\nSystem, 855 F.2d 167, 172-75 (4th Cir. 1988).\r                  \n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n     Walker says that McCarthy later acted  in bad faith when\r                                                \n\nin October  he blocked  Walker's reinstatement.   But nothing\n\nMcCarthy did after August 17 casts any doubt on his belief in\n\nAugust  that Walker's  previously  tendered  resignation  was\n\noutstanding at that time.  (Indeed, there is no evidence that\n\nMcCarthy  acted   in  bad   faith  in  October.)     Walker's\n\nalternative suggestion on appeal that the WHA might be liable\n\nfor  D'Angio's misrepresentations  is  made in  so cursory  a\n\nfashion that we regard it as waived.  Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co.,\r                                                                        \n\n916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n     Walker next claims that the magistrate judge should have\n\nordered his  reinstatement after the jury  found that D'Angio\n\nhad misrepresented the status  of Walker's resignation to the\n\nBoard.  The Board responds that section 1983 is a fault based\n\nstatute  and, since the Board  was not at  fault in accepting\n\nthe apparently  outstanding  resignation, the  court  had  no\n\npower to reinstate  Walker.   We need not  resolve the  legal\n\nquestion  whether  there could  be  equitable relief  without\n\nfault, since the magistrate  judge was unquestionably  within\n\nher  authority in holding  that the equities  did not warrant\n\nsuch relief.\n\n     At the time  that court-ordered reinstatement became  an\n\narguable option in late  1992, Walker's two-year contract had\n\nlong  since expired.  Further, Walker  himself caused much of\n\nthe confusion, not merely by his impetuous resignation letter\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nbut  by  failing  forthrightly  to withdraw  his  resignation\n\nthereafter,  choosing instead  to sponsor  new demands  as an\n\napparent condition of continuing  as executive director.  The\n\nmagistrate  judge soundly exercised her discretion in finding\n\nthat  Walker   had  no   equitable  claim  to   post-contract\n\nreinstatement.\n\n     2.   We come  now to the  difficult part of  the appeal,\n\nwhich is McCarthy's challenge to  the verdict against him  on\n\ncount IV.   McCarthy's  best argument  is  that the  evidence\n\nsimply was not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find\n\nthat McCarthy tortiously interfered with Walker's employment.\n\nThe claim was rejected by  the magistrate judge, who stressed\n\nthat the  jury is entitled to great  latitude in factfinding.\n\nWe agree  with the  principle but  cannot, in  this instance,\n\nagree  that a rational jury could  find that McCarthy engaged\n\nin tortious interference.\n\n     McCarthy's  first argument  is  that the  Board lawfully\n\naccepted  Walker's resignation  on August 17  and thereafter,\n\nwhen McCarthy took his  challenged actions before and  at the\n\nspecial meeting on October  7, no employment contract existed\n\nwith  which he could interfere.   We have  a different reason\n\nfor thinking that McCarthy could not be liable for tortiously\n\ninterfering with  an existing contract.   Whatever the status\r                                         \n\nof  Walker's resignation,  McCarthy reasonably  believed that\r                                                                    \n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nthe  resignation was outstanding on August 17 and that it had\n\nbeen accepted, thus terminating the contract.\n\n     Under Massachusetts law, one cannot tortiously interfere\n\nwith  a contract  that  one  reasonably  believes is  not  in\n\nexistence.  See Yiakas v. Savoy, 526 N.E.2d 1305, 1309 (Mass.\r                                           \n\nApp. Ct.), review denied, 529 N.E.2d 1346 (Mass. 1988) (actor\r                                    \n\nmust  have knowledge  of contract  and must  know that  he is\n\ninterfering with its performance).   Accordingly, it does not\n\nmatter whether the Board's  acceptance of the resignation was\n\nbased on a misunderstanding or even whether (in some Platonic\n\nsense)  the employment contract endured thereafter.  McCarthy\n\ncannot  be  liable  for tortious  interference  with contract\n\nrights that he had every reason to believe Walker had himself\n\nabandoned.\n\n     The question whether the resignation was rejected by the\n\nreturn  of the letter might  be of some  importance if Walker\n\nwere  appealing on his  original contract  claim, but  he has\n\nchosen not  to do so.  Even  then it would be  hard to resist\n\nthe conclusion that  if the resignation  was rejected by  the\n\nreturn  of the letter, it was effectively renewed by allowing\n\nD'Angio  to  assert  nonnegotiable  conditions  for  Walker's\n\nreturn.  It  is even easier to conclude that  McCarthy had no\n\nreason to  believe that  the resignation had  been withdrawn,\n\nand that is sufficient to protect his vote to accept it.\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\n     Walker, however, has a second string to his bow.  In his\n\ncomplaint,  count  IV  focused  on  McCarthy's   actions  \"in\n\npreventing  the  Board  .  . .  from  rescinding\"  the  prior\n\nasserted termination  of Walker.    Under Massachusetts  law,\n\nthis   kind  of  interference   with  prospective  employment\n\nrelations  is, like  interference  with existing  employment,\n\ntortious if  done out  of actual  malice or through  improper\n\nmeans.1   The magistrate judge so instructed the jury.  There\n\nis  no  showing  that   McCarthy's  means  were  unlawful  or\n\nintrinsically unethical,  so the  question to be  answered is\n\nwhether a reasonable jury could find that McCarthy acted with\n\nactual malice.\n\n     The case  for malice is extraordinarily  thin.  McCarthy\n\ntestified that  he postponed  the special meeting  because it\n\nwas a  busy period  in  his own  regular job  and because  he\n\nthought that it was right for Walsh as a new  Board member to\n\nconsider a matter that would affect his own period in office.\n\nNeither explanation was  directly impeached; and  whether the\n\nlatter  reason is deemed good or bad,  it is certainly a view\n\nthat could be entertained  without malice.  There is  also no\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     1When  an employer  or supervisor  is acting  within the\nscope  of  his employment  responsibilities,  the hiring  and\nfiring  decisions  are   privileged  unless  he  acted   with\nmalevolence.  Gram v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 429 N.E.2d 21,\r                                                         \n24 (Mass. 1981).   When a  third-party contract is  involved,\nliability is  tested differently.  Compare  King v. Driscoll,\r                                                                        \n638  N.E.2d  488,  494-95  (Mass.  1994)  with  Draghetti  v.\r                                                                     \nChmielewski, 626 N.E.2d 862, 870 n.14 (Mass. 1994).\r                       \n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nevidence  that  McCarthy's  discussions  with the  new  Board\n\nmember were improper or dishonest.  \n\n     Nor  do we  think  weight can  be  placed on  McCarthy's\n\nfailure to tell  the lawyer about  the prospective change  in\n\nmembership.  McCarthy was  assertedly concerned that he might\n\nbe under a legal obligation to call  the meeting on the night\n\ndesignated  in the request for  the special meeting and asked\n\nsomeone else to check  with the lawyer.  There is no evidence\n\nthat McCarthy thought that the change in Board membership was\n\npertinent to  this legal  question and deliberately  had this\n\ninformation withheld from the lawyer.\n\n     Finally, McCarthy's casting of  the tie vote,  allegedly\n\nagainst tradition for the  WHA chairman, proves nothing about\n\nmalice.   There is no  claim that  McCarthy broke any  law or\n\nrule.  Based on Walker's behavior--the impromptu resignation,\n\nthe  failure to come to the August 17 meeting, the apparently\n\nnon-negotiable  demands--there was ample  reason for McCarthy\n\nto think that it would be in the best interest of  the WHA if\n\nsomeone else were to assume the role of executive director.  \n\n     At trial Walker offered  evidence that he had complained\n\nto  McCarthy  that  the   latter's  brother-in-law,  also  an\n\nemployee of  the WHA, had been  performing insufficient work,\n\nand  that McCarthy  disagreed.   Nothing in  the fairly  tame\n\nevidence  about  this  episode  suggested  that  McCarthy had\n\nbecome angry,  threatened  Walker,  vowed  revenge,  or  done\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nanything  else   that  would  suggest  that   he  harbored  a\n\ncontinuing desire to harm Walker.\n\n     What  we  have  is  a  perfectly  plausible  story  from\n\nMcCarthy,  uncontradicted in either substance or detail, that\n\nis consistent in every respect with permissible motives.  The\n\njury might have thought it unfair that Walker, an eleven-year\n\nveteran  of WHA,  forfeit his  job because  of  one impulsive\n\nstep; it may have thought that McCarthy  was uncharitable and\n\nopportunistic.   But it  is impossible  to  understand how  a\n\nrational jury could  infer malice by  a preponderance of  the\n\nevidence when there is no evidence of malice at all.  \n\n     Of  course,  the  jury   may  simply  have   disbelieved\n\nMcCarthy's statement of his reasons; factfinders have a great\n\ndeal of latitude in  appraising witnesses, cf. D'Orsay Equip.\r                                                                         \n\nCo.  v. United States Rubber  Co., 302 F.2d  777, 779-80 (1st\r                                             \n\nCir.  1962), although  one might  think that  there  are some\n\nlimits where  the story  is plausible, consistent  and wholly\n\nuncontradicted.    Cf. Frank  Music  Corp. v.  Metro-Goldwyn-\r                                                                         \n\nMayer, Inc., 772 F.2d 505, 514 n.8 (9th Cir. 1985).  But even\r                       \n\nif McCarthy were  not credited in one particular  or another,\n\nWalker's  burden   goes  beyond  merely   setting  McCarthy's\n\ntestimony  aside:    the  burden  was  upon  Walker  to  show\n\naffirmatively that McCarthy acted out of malice.  \n\n     Most  of the authorities say that  one side cannot carry\n\nits affirmative burden of proof on  a fact by pointing to the\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\npossibility that the jury disbelieved the other side's denial\n\nof the  fact.

Here, there is no\n\n\"other evidence\" of malice and malice is not the only logical\n\nalternative to  believing in  full McCarthy's account  of his\n\nown motives in postponing the meeting.\n\n     The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has stressed\n\nthat in tortious interference cases  involving employment and\n\ndischarge, malice means \"actual malice\" and \"[a]ny reasonable\n\ninference  of malice  must .  . .  be based  on probabilities\n\nrather  than possibilities.\"  Gram, 429 N.E.2d at 24-25.

The letter read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>Mr. Louis D'Angio Chairman Waltham Housing Authority, I hereby resign effective 6:50 p.m. Aug. 12, 1987 and will file for retirement Aug. 13, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>/s/ John J. Walker</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Angio passed the letter around to the other Board members, and the Board voted unanimously to table Walker's resignation for further consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the meeting D'Angio, at the urging of Board members, went to Walker's office to talk him out of resigning.  D'Angio returned the resignation letter to Walker, placing it on his desk and telling him that the Board wanted him to take it back.  Walker said nothing but (he later testified) put the letter in his shirt pocket, believing that his resignation had been rejected.  The next day Walker came into the office and did not file papers applying for retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board scheduled a special meeting for August 17 to address the matter of Walker's resignation, which was still tabled.  Three days before the meeting Walker told D'Angio that he wanted three matters \"handled\" or \"cleared up\":  a modification of the assistant executive director's job description;  a $2,000 salary adjustment for Dorothy Boyle, who was an assistant WHA administrator and Walker's sister-in-law;  and Board agreement to Walker's \"strong input\" into selections for assistant executive director and two other positions.  D'Angio asked Walker not to attend the August 17 Board meeting but to let D'Angio present his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Angio did not tell the Board that he had given Walker his resignation letter back.  Instead, at the August 17 meeting D'Angio declared that Walker would rescind his resignation only if the Board agreed to meet three conditions.  The three conditions, presented as nonnegotiable demands by D'Angio, were the same three matters that Walker had told D'Angio at their August 14 meeting that he wanted \"cleared up.\"   The Board had no objection to the first two conditions, but balked at the third request--Walker's \"strong input\" into the Board's selection of the top staff positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two members of the Board, McCarthy and Joseph Pavone, were concerned that Walker wanted the final say on hiring for those positions;  they asked if Walker would come before the Board to discuss his position on this matter.  D'Angio said that the three conditions were a \"take it or leave it\" proposition and that Walker would not appear to discuss them.  On McCarthy's motion, the Board then voted to accept Walker's resignation.  D'Angio joined in the unanimous vote but then resigned as chairman, and McCarthy was elected to complete D'Angio's term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Afterwards, D'Angio discussed with Alfred Bergin, another Board member, the possibility of calling a special meeting to \"straighten the whole matter out.\"   The WHA's bylaws required the chairman to schedule a special meeting of the Board upon the request of two members.  D'Angio believed that there were at least three Board members--Bergin, Pavone and himself--that could be counted on to vote for Walker's reinstatement at a special meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated September 3, D'Angio and Bergin requested that McCarthy schedule a special meeting for September 21 to discuss Walker's resignation.  The proposed date was significant because it was just before Bergin's term on the Board was slated to expire on October 1.  The letter recommended that Walker be invited to address the Board.  On September 9, Walker himself sent a letter to the Board asking for an opportunity to speak to them about \"a few misunderstandings\" concerning his resignation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy told a subordinate to ask an attorney whether McCarthy had authority to defer the Board meeting, and the attorney said that McCarthy had authority to select the date himself although the meeting should be held at the earliest time convenient for all members.  After getting this legal advice, McCarthy put off the requested meeting until October 7, six days after Bergin's departure from the Board.  Apparently, the attorney had no information about Bergin's expected departure between the two dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy later testified that he had postponed the meeting because of conflicts with his own heavy work schedule in September, but also because he wanted Bergin's replacement, Henry Walsh, to consider the issue of Walker's resignation;  Walsh, said McCarthy, would be living with the outcome of the controversy during his term on the Board.  McCarthy spoke with Walsh about the issue of Walker's resignation before the special meeting, and Walsh told McCarthy that he wanted nothing to do with that \"mess.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker appeared before the Board on October 7, and raised the same three matters that D'Angio had set forth at the August 17 meeting.  After hearing from Walker, who requested his job back, the Board voted on whether to waive its earlier acceptance of his resignation and to reinstate him as executive director.  Two members--D'Angio and Pavone--voted for Walker's reinstatement, and one member voted against it.  Henry Walsh, Bergin's replacement on the Board, abstained.  Apparently breaking with Board tradition, McCarthy as chairman then cast a no vote to create a tie, which defeated the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker filed suit against the WHA and McCarthy on December 23, 1987, claiming that he had rescinded his resignation prior to the Board's August 17 meeting, thereby preventing the WHA from accepting it.  As later amended, the complaint set forth six counts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Count I, brought under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, alleged that the WHA and McCarthy violated Walker's due process rights by terminating him without a prior hearing;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Counts II and III alleged that the WHA breached Walker's employment contract and its own personnel policies;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Count IV alleged that McCarthy tortiously interfered with Walker's employment;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Count V alleged that McCarthy violated the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 12;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Count VI sought a declaratory judgment that, as a result of the preceding conduct, Walker's dismissal by the WHA was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker requested compensatory and punitive damages, reinstatement, back pay, attorney's fees and various other forms of equitable relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On count I, Walker's section 1983 claim, the district court granted summary judgment for McCarthy and for the WHA \"with respect to liability for monetary damages.\"   The court found that McCarthy was immune from section 1983 liability because, given D'Angio's statements to the Board, McCarthy was entitled to vote to accept what he believed to be Walker's still outstanding resignation letter.  As for the WHA, the court ruled that D'Angio's alleged misrepresentations to the Board on August 17 did not make the WHA liable for damages, since D'Angio lacked final policymaking authority to act for the WHA to alter Walker's employment status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the district court ruled that Walker might still be able to obtain equitable relief under count I in the form of reinstatement as the WHA's executive director.  Framing this issue for trial, the district judge wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>[A]t least in the factual context of this case, if Walker can convince the jury that he had unconditionally rescinded his resignation prior to the August 17 Board meeting and that D'Angio misrepresented that fact to the Board, then plaintiff may be entitled to reinstatement as Executive Director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of McCarthy and the WHA, on counts II (breach of contract), III (breach of personnel policies) and V (state civil rights claim).  On count VI (the declaratory judgment claim) the court dismissed \"[t]hose portions ... having to do with the counts that have been disposed of on summary judgment....\"  The court denied summary judgment for McCarthy on count IV (Walker's tortious interference with employment claim) ruling that McCarthy enjoyed no immunity from intentional torts under Massachusetts law and that Walker had raised a triable issue of fact as to McCarthy's motivations in scheduling the October 7 special meeting and voting at that meeting to create a tie.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This left for trial count I, limited to equitable relief against WHA, count IV (the tortious interference claim against McCarthy) and possible declaratory judgment.  After conferring with the parties, the district judge entered a pretrial order.  The parties agreed that the case would be tried, with a jury, before a magistrate judge.  They also agreed that \"the only issues to be tried,\" as framed by the order, were:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Whether Louis D'Angio misrepresented to the Board of the Waltham Housing Authority plaintiff's alleged revocation of his resignation and, if so,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Whether Edward McCarthy tortiously interfered with plaintiff's employment as the Authority's executive director?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) The amount of damages.  Plaintiff claims for back pay at least to December 31, 1988, medical insurance, life insurance, pension benefits, and the use of an automobile.  The parties agreed to stipulate the amounts of the separate elements of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties also agreed to bifurcate the trial with issue (a) to be tried first (\"phase I\"), to be followed by the trial of issues (b) and (c) (\"phase II\"), if necessary, to the same jury immediately after the verdict on issue (a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the defendants moved to strike Walker's jury trial demand on phase I, arguing that count I was now limited to an equitable remedy triable to the court.  The magistrate judge denied the motion, noting that phase I of the trial encompassed a factual determination--whether Walker had withdrawn his resignation--that was common to both Walker's equitable claim under count I and his legal claim under count IV.  The court said this issue should therefore be tried to the jury, but the court would ultimately decide whether equitable relief was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial on phase I then proceeded.  The trial evidence has already been summarized above in the light most favorable to the verdict.  Hendricks &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Daewoo Corp., 923 F.2d 209, 214 (1st Cir.1991).  On November 19, 1992, the jury answered affirmatively each of the three questions submitted to it on issue (a):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>1.  Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff John Walker has proven that he rescinded or revoked his written resignation prior to the August 17, 1987, board meeting?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>2. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff John Walker has proven that the rescission or revocation of his resignation was unconditional?3. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff has proven that Mr. D'Angio misrepresented to the board on August 17, 1987, the fact that plaintiff had unconditionally rescinded or revoked his resignation?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day trial proceeded to phase II, to address issues (b) and (c) outlined in the pretrial order.  On November 30, the jury found that McCarthy had tortiously interfered with Walker's employment at the WHA and awarded him $79,018.78 in damages.  The jury also answered affirmatively the following five questions in phase II:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>1.  Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff had an employment relationship with the Waltham Housing Authority?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>2. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff has proven that defendant McCarthy knew about this relationship?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>3. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff has proven that defendant McCarthy's interference, in addition to being intentional, was malicious?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>4. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff has proven that his loss of employment relationship directly resulted from defendant McCarthy's conduct?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>5. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that defendant McCarthy was motivated by actual malice, amounting to malevolence, spite or ill will?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5, 1993, the magistrate judge entered an order denying Walker reinstatement under count I on the ground that the equities weighed against reinstatement.  The magistrate judge initially ordered back pay as equitable relief and declared that Walker's termination was improper but on reconsideration vacated both awards--the former on the ground that it was foreclosed by the district court's pretrial rulings, and the latter on the ground that the WHA had acted in good faith so that the termination could not be described as improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Final judgment was entered on August 26, 1993, in favor of the WHA and McCarthy on all claims except count IV.  On count IV judgment was entered for Walker against McCarthy in the amount of $79,018.78.  The court denied Walker's request for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988, finding that he was not a prevailing party under that section.  Both sides have appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. We first address Walker's challenge to the district court's rulings that on count I McCarthy was entitled to qualified immunity under section 1983 and that under that section the WHA was not municipally liable for damages for either McCarthy's or D'Angio's conduct.  We review these summary judgment determinations de novo, Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir.1994), but find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dismissing the damage claims under count I, the district court held that on the undisputed facts Walker had submitted his resignation to the Board and thereafter had given the Board no reason to think that the resignation had been withdrawn.  We agree that when McCarthy voted on August 17 to accept the resignation, he had no reason to think that the Board was firing Walker or infringing upon any due process right that Walker might have to a prior hearing before being involuntarily dismissed.  Feliciano-Angulo v. Rivera-Cruz, 858 F.2d 40, 42-44 (1st Cir.1988).  Accordingly, McCarthy had qualified immunity for his August 17 actions.  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2736-39, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps a municipality might in rare cases be liable for a constitutional violation, even though the individual who acted for it was protected by qualified immunity.  See Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 647, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 1413, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980).  But--ignoring the other requisites for municipal liability, see City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S.Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988)--in this case it is difficult to see how there could be a constitutional violation at all since a majority of the Board reasonably thought that they had a voluntary resignation before them.  See Stone v. University of Maryland Medical System, 855 F.2d 167, 172-75 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker says that McCarthy later acted in bad faith when in October he blocked Walker's reinstatement.  But nothing McCarthy did after August 17 casts any doubt on his belief in August that Walker's previously tendered resignation was outstanding at that time.  (Indeed, there is no evidence that McCarthy acted in bad faith in October.)   Walker's alternative suggestion on appeal that the WHA might be liable for D'Angio's misrepresentations is made in so cursory a fashion that we regard it as waived.  Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker next claims that the magistrate judge should have ordered his reinstatement after the jury found that D'Angio had misrepresented the status of Walker's resignation to the Board.  The Board responds that section 1983 is a fault based statute and, since the Board was not at fault in accepting the apparently outstanding resignation, the court had no power to reinstate Walker.  We need not resolve the legal question whether there could be equitable relief without fault, since the magistrate judge was unquestionably within her authority in holding that the equities did not warrant such relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time that court-ordered reinstatement became an arguable option in late 1992, Walker's two-year contract had long since expired.  Further, Walker himself caused much of the confusion, not merely by his impetuous resignation letter but by failing forthrightly to withdraw his resignation thereafter, choosing instead to sponsor new demands as an apparent condition of continuing as executive director.  The magistrate judge soundly exercised her discretion in finding that Walker had no equitable claim to post-contract reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  We come now to the difficult part of the appeal, which is McCarthy's challenge to the verdict against him on count IV.  McCarthy's best argument is that the evidence simply was not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that McCarthy tortiously interfered with Walker's employment.  The claim was rejected by the magistrate judge, who stressed that the jury is entitled to great latitude in factfinding.  We agree with the principle but cannot, in this instance, agree that a rational jury could find that McCarthy engaged in tortious interference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy's first argument is that the Board lawfully accepted Walker's resignation on August 17 and thereafter, when McCarthy took his challenged actions before and at the special meeting on October 7, no employment contract existed with which he could interfere.  We have a different reason for thinking that McCarthy could not be liable for tortiously interfering with an existing contract.  Whatever the status of Walker's resignation, McCarthy reasonably believed that the resignation was outstanding on August 17 and that it had been accepted, thus terminating the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, one cannot tortiously interfere with a contract that one reasonably believes is not in existence.  See Yiakas v. Savoy, 26 Mass.App.Ct. 310, 526 N.E.2d 1305, 1309, review denied, 403 Mass. 1103, 529 N.E.2d 1346 (1988) (actor must have knowledge of contract and must know that he is interfering with its performance).  Accordingly, it does not matter whether the Board's acceptance of the resignation was based on a misunderstanding or even whether (in some Platonic sense) the employment contract endured thereafter.  McCarthy cannot be liable for tortious interference with contract rights that he had every reason to believe Walker had himself abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether the resignation was rejected by the return of the letter might be of some importance if Walker were appealing on his original contract claim, but he has chosen not to do so.  Even then it would be hard to resist the conclusion that if the resignation was rejected by the return of the letter, it was effectively renewed by allowing D'Angio to assert nonnegotiable conditions for Walker's return.  It is even easier to conclude that McCarthy had no reason to believe that the resignation had been withdrawn, and that is sufficient to protect his vote to accept it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker, however, has a second string to his bow.  In his complaint, count IV focused on McCarthy's actions \"in preventing the Board ... from rescinding\" the prior asserted termination of Walker.  Under Massachusetts law, this kind of interference with prospective employment relations is, like interference with existing employment, tortious if done out of actual malice or through improper means.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The magistrate judge so instructed the jury.  There is no showing that McCarthy's means were unlawful or intrinsically unethical, so the question to be answered is whether a reasonable jury could find that McCarthy acted with actual malice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case for malice is extraordinarily thin.  McCarthy testified that he postponed the special meeting because it was a busy period in his own regular job and because he thought that it was right for Walsh as a new Board member to consider a matter that would affect his own period in office.  Neither explanation was directly impeached;  and whether the latter reason is deemed good or bad, it is certainly a view that could be entertained without malice.  There is also no evidence that McCarthy's discussions with the new Board member were improper or dishonest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we think weight can be placed on McCarthy's failure to tell the lawyer about the prospective change in membership.  McCarthy was assertedly concerned that he might be under a legal obligation to call the meeting on the night designated in the request for the special meeting and asked someone else to check with the lawyer.  There is no evidence that McCarthy thought that the change in Board membership was pertinent to this legal question and deliberately had this information withheld from the lawyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McCarthy's casting of the tie vote, allegedly against tradition for the WHA chairman, proves nothing about malice.  There is no claim that McCarthy broke any law or rule.  Based on Walker's behavior--the impromptu resignation, the failure to come to the August 17 meeting, the apparently nonnegotiable demands--there was ample reason for McCarthy to think that it would be in the best interest of the WHA if someone else were to assume the role of executive director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Walker offered evidence that he had complained to McCarthy that the latter's brother-in-law, also an employee of the WHA, had been performing insufficient work, and that McCarthy disagreed.  Nothing in the fairly tame evidence about this episode suggested that McCarthy had become angry, threatened Walker, vowed revenge, or done anything else that would suggest that he harbored a continuing desire to harm Walker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have is a perfectly plausible story from McCarthy, uncontradicted in either substance or detail, that is consistent in every respect with permissible motives.  The jury might have thought it unfair that Walker, an eleven-year veteran of WHA, forfeit his job because of one impulsive step;  it may have thought that McCarthy was uncharitable and opportunistic.  But it is impossible to understand how a rational jury could infer malice by a preponderance of the evidence when there is no evidence of malice at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the jury may simply have disbelieved McCarthy's statement of his reasons;  factfinders have a great deal of latitude in appraising witnesses, cf. D'Orsay Equip.  Co. v. United States Rubber Co., 302 F.2d 777, 779-80 (1st Cir.1962), although one might think that there are some limits where the story is plausible, consistent and wholly uncontradicted.  Cf. Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 772 F.2d 505, 514 n. 8 (9th Cir.1985).  But even if McCarthy were not credited in one particular or another, Walker's burden goes beyond merely setting McCarthy's testimony aside:  the burden was upon Walker to show affirmatively that McCarthy acted out of malice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the authorities say that one side cannot carry its affirmative burden of proof on a fact by pointing to the possibility that the jury disbelieved the other side's denial of the fact.  United States v. Zeigler, 994 F.2d 845, 848-50 (D.C.Cir.1993);  Janigan v. Taylor, 344 F.2d 781, 784-85 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 879, 86 S.Ct. 163, 15 L.Ed.2d 120 (1965);  Dyer v. MacDougall, 201 F.2d 265, 268-69 (2d Cir.1952) (Hand, J.).  But others have disagreed, see United States v. Zafiro, 945 F.2d 881, 888 (7th Cir.1991), aff'd on other grounds, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993), and the strength of such an inference could vary greatly depending on context, including other evidence and the logical force of the inference.  Here, there is no \"other evidence\" of malice and malice is not the only logical alternative to believing in full McCarthy's account of his own motives in postponing the meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has stressed that in tortious interference cases involving employment and discharge, malice means \"actual malice\" and \"[a]ny reasonable inference of malice must ... be based on probabilities rather than possibilities.\"  Gram, 429 N.E.2d at 24-25.   The court continued:  \"An inference of the probability of malice, action motivated by spite, does not reasonably follow from a showing, in these circumstances, only of negligence or of sloppy and unfair business practices.\"  Id. at 25.   This is virtually an epitaph on Walker's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining claims and arguments by both sides are mooted by our decision.  The appellants' numerous other attacks on Walker's monetary judgment need not be considered.  Likewise, Walker's claim that attorney's fees and costs should have been granted him under Rule 54(d) and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988 fails since he has obtained no relief at all.  The judgment in favor of WHA and McCarthy on all claims other than count IV is affirmed;  the judgment in favor of Walker and against McCarthy on count IV is reversed.   No costs in this court are awarded to either side.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> When an employer or supervisor is acting within the scope of his employment responsibilities, the hiring and firing decisions are privileged unless he acted with malevolence.

In 1987, appellee John J. Walker had served as the WHA's executive director for over eleven years and was currently serving in this position under a two-year written contract due to expire on December 31, 1988.  The WHA Board of Commissioners consisted of five members, including Chairman Louis D'Angio and appellant Edward McCarthy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1987, the Board began a personnel search to replace the WHA's retiring assistant executive director.  At a board meeting on August 12, Walker expressed his dissatisfaction with the three finalists whom the Board was considering.  The Board nevertheless selected one of the remaining candidates, Walter McGuire, to fill the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Believing that his contract gave him the final say on hiring, and angered by the Board's action in selecting McGuire over his objection, Walker presented Chairmen D'Angio with a hastily scribbled letter of resignation and then left the meeting.  The letter read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>Mr. Louis D'Angio Chairman Waltham Housing Authority, I hereby resign effective 6:50 p.m. Aug. 12, 1987 and will file for retirement Aug. 13, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>/s/ John J. Walker</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Angio passed the letter around to the other Board members, and the Board voted unanimously to table Walker's resignation for further consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the meeting D'Angio, at the urging of Board members, went to Walker's office to talk him out of resigning.  D'Angio returned the resignation letter to Walker, placing it on his desk and telling him that the Board wanted him to take it back.  Walker said nothing but (he later testified) put the letter in his shirt pocket, believing that his resignation had been rejected.  The next day Walker came into the office and did not file papers applying for retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board scheduled a special meeting for August 17 to address the matter of Walker's resignation, which was still tabled.  Three days before the meeting Walker told D'Angio that he wanted three matters \"handled\" or \"cleared up\":  a modification of the assistant executive director's job description;  a $2,000 salary adjustment for Dorothy Boyle, who was an assistant WHA administrator and Walker's sister-in-law;  and Board agreement to Walker's \"strong input\" into selections for assistant executive director and two other positions.  D'Angio asked Walker not to attend the August 17 Board meeting but to let D'Angio present his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Angio did not tell the Board that he had given Walker his resignation letter back.  Instead, at the August 17 meeting D'Angio declared that Walker would rescind his resignation only if the Board agreed to meet three conditions.  The three conditions, presented as nonnegotiable demands by D'Angio, were the same three matters that Walker had told D'Angio at their August 14 meeting that he wanted \"cleared up.\"   The Board had no objection to the first two conditions, but balked at the third request--Walker's \"strong input\" into the Board's selection of the top staff positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two members of the Board, McCarthy and Joseph Pavone, were concerned that Walker wanted the final say on hiring for those positions;  they asked if Walker would come before the Board to discuss his position on this matter.  D'Angio said that the three conditions were a \"take it or leave it\" proposition and that Walker would not appear to discuss them.  On McCarthy's motion, the Board then voted to accept Walker's resignation.  D'Angio joined in the unanimous vote but then resigned as chairman, and McCarthy was elected to complete D'Angio's term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Afterwards, D'Angio discussed with Alfred Bergin, another Board member, the possibility of calling a special meeting to \"straighten the whole matter out.\"   The WHA's bylaws required the chairman to schedule a special meeting of the Board upon the request of two members.  D'Angio believed that there were at least three Board members--Bergin, Pavone and himself--that could be counted on to vote for Walker's reinstatement at a special meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated September 3, D'Angio and Bergin requested that McCarthy schedule a special meeting for September 21 to discuss Walker's resignation.  The proposed date was significant because it was just before Bergin's term on the Board was slated to expire on October 1.  The letter recommended that Walker be invited to address the Board.  On September 9, Walker himself sent a letter to the Board asking for an opportunity to speak to them about \"a few misunderstandings\" concerning his resignation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy told a subordinate to ask an attorney whether McCarthy had authority to defer the Board meeting, and the attorney said that McCarthy had authority to select the date himself although the meeting should be held at the earliest time convenient for all members.  After getting this legal advice, McCarthy put off the requested meeting until October 7, six days after Bergin's departure from the Board.  Apparently, the attorney had no information about Bergin's expected departure between the two dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy later testified that he had postponed the meeting because of conflicts with his own heavy work schedule in September, but also because he wanted Bergin's replacement, Henry Walsh, to consider the issue of Walker's resignation;  Walsh, said McCarthy, would be living with the outcome of the controversy during his term on the Board.  McCarthy spoke with Walsh about the issue of Walker's resignation before the special meeting, and Walsh told McCarthy that he wanted nothing to do with that \"mess.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker appeared before the Board on October 7, and raised the same three matters that D'Angio had set forth at the August 17 meeting.  After hearing from Walker, who requested his job back, the Board voted on whether to waive its earlier acceptance of his resignation and to reinstate him as executive director.  Two members--D'Angio and Pavone--voted for Walker's reinstatement, and one member voted against it.  Henry Walsh, Bergin's replacement on the Board, abstained.  Apparently breaking with Board tradition, McCarthy as chairman then cast a no vote to create a tie, which defeated the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker filed suit against the WHA and McCarthy on December 23, 1987, claiming that he had rescinded his resignation prior to the Board's August 17 meeting, thereby preventing the WHA from accepting it.  As later amended, the complaint set forth six counts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Count I, brought under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, alleged that the WHA and McCarthy violated Walker's due process rights by terminating him without a prior hearing;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Counts II and III alleged that the WHA breached Walker's employment contract and its own personnel policies;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Count IV alleged that McCarthy tortiously interfered with Walker's employment;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Count V alleged that McCarthy violated the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 12;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. Count VI sought a declaratory judgment that, as a result of the preceding conduct, Walker's dismissal by the WHA was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker requested compensatory and punitive damages, reinstatement, back pay, attorney's fees and various other forms of equitable relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On count I, Walker's section 1983 claim, the district court granted summary judgment for McCarthy and for the WHA \"with respect to liability for monetary damages.\"   The court found that McCarthy was immune from section 1983 liability because, given D'Angio's statements to the Board, McCarthy was entitled to vote to accept what he believed to be Walker's still outstanding resignation letter.  As for the WHA, the court ruled that D'Angio's alleged misrepresentations to the Board on August 17 did not make the WHA liable for damages, since D'Angio lacked final policymaking authority to act for the WHA to alter Walker's employment status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the district court ruled that Walker might still be able to obtain equitable relief under count I in the form of reinstatement as the WHA's executive director.  Framing this issue for trial, the district judge wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>[A]t least in the factual context of this case, if Walker can convince the jury that he had unconditionally rescinded his resignation prior to the August 17 Board meeting and that D'Angio misrepresented that fact to the Board, then plaintiff may be entitled to reinstatement as Executive Director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of McCarthy and the WHA, on counts II (breach of contract), III (breach of personnel policies) and V (state civil rights claim).  On count VI (the declaratory judgment claim) the court dismissed \"[t]hose portions ... having to do with the counts that have been disposed of on summary judgment....\"  The court denied summary judgment for McCarthy on count IV (Walker's tortious interference with employment claim) ruling that McCarthy enjoyed no immunity from intentional torts under Massachusetts law and that Walker had raised a triable issue of fact as to McCarthy's motivations in scheduling the October 7 special meeting and voting at that meeting to create a tie.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This left for trial count I, limited to equitable relief against WHA, count IV (the tortious interference claim against McCarthy) and possible declaratory judgment.  After conferring with the parties, the district judge entered a pretrial order.  The parties agreed that the case would be tried, with a jury, before a magistrate judge.  They also agreed that \"the only issues to be tried,\" as framed by the order, were:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Whether Louis D'Angio misrepresented to the Board of the Waltham Housing Authority plaintiff's alleged revocation of his resignation and, if so,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Whether Edward McCarthy tortiously interfered with plaintiff's employment as the Authority's executive director?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) The amount of damages.  Plaintiff claims for back pay at least to December 31, 1988, medical insurance, life insurance, pension benefits, and the use of an automobile.  The parties agreed to stipulate the amounts of the separate elements of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties also agreed to bifurcate the trial with issue (a) to be tried first (\"phase I\"), to be followed by the trial of issues (b) and (c) (\"phase II\"), if necessary, to the same jury immediately after the verdict on issue (a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the defendants moved to strike Walker's jury trial demand on phase I, arguing that count I was now limited to an equitable remedy triable to the court.  The magistrate judge denied the motion, noting that phase I of the trial encompassed a factual determination--whether Walker had withdrawn his resignation--that was common to both Walker's equitable claim under count I and his legal claim under count IV.  The court said this issue should therefore be tried to the jury, but the court would ultimately decide whether equitable relief was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial on phase I then proceeded.  The trial evidence has already been summarized above in the light most favorable to the verdict.  Hendricks &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Daewoo Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554020\"><a href=\"/opinion/554020/hendricks-associates-inc-v-daewoo-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, 214 (1st Cir.1991).  On November 19, 1992, the jury answered affirmatively each of the three questions submitted to it on issue (a):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>1.  Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff John Walker has proven that he rescinded or revoked his written resignation prior to the August 17, 1987, board meeting?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>2. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff John Walker has proven that the rescission or revocation of his resignation was unconditional?3. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff has proven that Mr. D'Angio misrepresented to the board on August 17, 1987, the fact that plaintiff had unconditionally rescinded or revoked his resignation?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day trial proceeded to phase II, to address issues (b) and (c) outlined in the pretrial order.  On November 30, the jury found that McCarthy had tortiously interfered with Walker's employment at the WHA and awarded him $79,018.78 in damages.  The jury also answered affirmatively the following five questions in phase II:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>1.  Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff had an employment relationship with the Waltham Housing Authority?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>2. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff has proven that defendant McCarthy knew about this relationship?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>3. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff has proven that defendant McCarthy's interference, in addition to being intentional, was malicious?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>4. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff has proven that his loss of employment relationship directly resulted from defendant McCarthy's conduct?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>5. Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that defendant McCarthy was motivated by actual malice, amounting to malevolence, spite or ill will?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5, 1993, the magistrate judge entered an order denying Walker reinstatement under count I on the ground that the equities weighed against reinstatement.  The magistrate judge initially ordered back pay as equitable relief and declared that Walker's termination was improper but on reconsideration vacated both awards--the former on the ground that it was foreclosed by the district court's pretrial rulings, and the latter on the ground that the WHA had acted in good faith so that the termination could not be described as improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Final judgment was entered on August 26, 1993, in favor of the WHA and McCarthy on all claims except count IV.  On count IV judgment was entered for Walker against McCarthy in the amount of $79,018.78.  The court denied Walker's request for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988, finding that he was not a prevailing party under that section.  Both sides have appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. We first address Walker's challenge to the district court's rulings that on count I McCarthy was entitled to qualified immunity under section 1983 and that under that section the WHA was not municipally liable for damages for either McCarthy's or D'Angio's conduct.  We review these summary judgment determinations de novo, Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195359\"><a href=\"/opinion/195359/denis-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 581 (1st Cir.1994), but find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dismissing the damage claims under count I, the district court held that on the undisputed facts Walker had submitted his resignation to the Board and thereafter had given the Board no reason to think that the resignation had been withdrawn.  We agree that when McCarthy voted on August 17 to accept the resignation, he had no reason to think that the Board was firing Walker or infringing upon any due process right that Walker might have to a prior hearing before being involuntarily dismissed.  Feliciano-Angulo v.

See Owen v. City of Independence, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110236\"><a href=\"/opinion/110236/owen-v-independence/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 647, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110236\"><a href=\"/opinion/110236/owen-v-independence/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span> </a></span>(1988)--in this case it is difficult to see how there could be a constitutional violation at all since a majority of the Board reasonably thought that they had a voluntary resignation before them.  See Stone v. University of Maryland Medical System, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510650\"><a href=\"/opinion/510650/h-harlan-stone-md-frederick-k-toy-md-walter-pegoli-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 172-75 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker says that McCarthy later acted in bad faith when in October he blocked Walker's reinstatement.  But nothing McCarthy did after August 17 casts any doubt on his belief in August that Walker's previously tendered resignation was outstanding at that time.  (Indeed, there is no evidence that McCarthy acted in bad faith in October.)   Walker's alternative suggestion on appeal that the WHA might be liable for D'Angio's misrepresentations is made in so cursory a fashion that we regard it as waived.  Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550084\"><a href=\"/opinion/550084/maury-a-ryan-dba-ryan-klimek-ryan-partnership-v-royal-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 734 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker next claims that the magistrate judge should have ordered his reinstatement after the jury found that D'Angio had misrepresented the status of Walker's resignation to the Board.  The Board responds that section 1983 is a fault based statute and, since the Board was not at fault in accepting the apparently outstanding resignation, the court had no power to reinstate Walker.  We need not resolve the legal question whether there could be equitable relief without fault, since the magistrate judge was unquestionably within her authority in holding that the equities did not warrant such relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time that court-ordered reinstatement became an arguable option in late 1992, Walker's two-year contract had long since expired.  Further, Walker himself caused much of the confusion, not merely by his impetuous resignation letter but by failing forthrightly to withdraw his resignation thereafter, choosing instead to sponsor new demands as an apparent condition of continuing as executive director.  The magistrate judge soundly exercised her discretion in finding that Walker had no equitable claim to post-contract reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  We come now to the difficult part of the appeal, which is McCarthy's challenge to the verdict against him on count IV.  McCarthy's best argument is that the evidence simply was not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that McCarthy tortiously interfered with Walker's employment.  The claim was rejected by the magistrate judge, who stressed that the jury is entitled to great latitude in factfinding.  We agree with the principle but cannot, in this instance, agree that a rational jury could find that McCarthy engaged in tortious interference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy's first argument is that the Board lawfully accepted Walker's resignation on August 17 and thereafter, when McCarthy took his challenged actions before and at the special meeting on October 7, no employment contract existed with which he could interfere.  We have a different reason for thinking that McCarthy could not be liable for tortiously interfering with an existing contract.  Whatever the status of Walker's resignation, McCarthy reasonably believed that the resignation was outstanding on August 17 and that it had been accepted, thus terminating the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, one cannot tortiously interfere with a contract that one reasonably believes is not in existence.  See Yiakas v. Savoy, 26 Mass.App.Ct. 310, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2026368\"><a href=\"/opinion/2026368/yiakas-v-savoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span>, 1309, review denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span> </span>(1988) (actor must have knowledge of contract and must know that he is interfering with its performance).  Accordingly, it does not matter whether the Board's acceptance of the resignation was based on a misunderstanding or even whether (in some Platonic sense) the employment contract endured thereafter.  McCarthy cannot be liable for tortious interference with contract rights that he had every reason to believe Walker had himself abandoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether the resignation was rejected by the return of the letter might be of some importance if Walker were appealing on his original contract claim, but he has chosen not to do so.  Even then it would be hard to resist the conclusion that if the resignation was rejected by the return of the letter, it was effectively renewed by allowing D'Angio to assert nonnegotiable conditions for Walker's return.  It is even easier to conclude that McCarthy had no reason to believe that the resignation had been withdrawn, and that is sufficient to protect his vote to accept it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker, however, has a second string to his bow.  In his complaint, count IV focused on McCarthy's actions \"in preventing the Board ... from rescinding\" the prior asserted termination of Walker.  Under Massachusetts law, this kind of interference with prospective employment relations is, like interference with existing employment, tortious if done out of actual malice or through improper means.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The magistrate judge so instructed the jury.  There is no showing that McCarthy's means were unlawful or intrinsically unethical, so the question to be answered is whether a reasonable jury could find that McCarthy acted with actual malice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case for malice is extraordinarily thin.  McCarthy testified that he postponed the special meeting because it was a busy period in his own regular job and because he thought that it was right for Walsh as a new Board member to consider a matter that would affect his own period in office.  Neither explanation was directly impeached;  and whether the latter reason is deemed good or bad, it is certainly a view that could be entertained without malice.  There is also no evidence that McCarthy's discussions with the new Board member were improper or dishonest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we think weight can be placed on McCarthy's failure to tell the lawyer about the prospective change in membership.  McCarthy was assertedly concerned that he might be under a legal obligation to call the meeting on the night designated in the request for the special meeting and asked someone else to check with the lawyer.  There is no evidence that McCarthy thought that the change in Board membership was pertinent to this legal question and deliberately had this information withheld from the lawyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McCarthy's casting of the tie vote, allegedly against tradition for the WHA chairman, proves nothing about malice.  There is no claim that McCarthy broke any law or rule.  Based on Walker's behavior--the impromptu resignation, the failure to come to the August 17 meeting, the apparently nonnegotiable demands--there was ample reason for McCarthy to think that it would be in the best interest of the WHA if someone else were to assume the role of executive director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Walker offered evidence that he had complained to McCarthy that the latter's brother-in-law, also an employee of the WHA, had been performing insufficient work, and that McCarthy disagreed.  Nothing in the fairly tame evidence about this episode suggested that McCarthy had become angry, threatened Walker, vowed revenge, or done anything else that would suggest that he harbored a continuing desire to harm Walker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have is a perfectly plausible story from McCarthy, uncontradicted in either substance or detail, that is consistent in every respect with permissible motives.  The jury might have thought it unfair that Walker, an eleven-year veteran of WHA, forfeit his job because of one impulsive step;  it may have thought that McCarthy was uncharitable and opportunistic.  But it is impossible to understand how a rational jury could infer malice by a preponderance of the evidence when there is no evidence of malice at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the jury may simply have disbelieved McCarthy's statement of his reasons;  factfinders have a great deal of latitude in appraising witnesses, cf. D'Orsay Equip.  Co. v. United States Rubber Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"257118\"><a href=\"/opinion/257118/dorsay-equipment-co-inc-v-united-states-rubber-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span>, 779-80 (1st Cir.1962), although one might think that there are some limits where the story is plausible, consistent and wholly uncontradicted.  Cf. Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457915\"><a href=\"/opinion/457915/frank-music-corporation-robert-wright-george-forrest-anne-lederer-as-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 514 n. 8 (9th Cir.1985).  But even if McCarthy were not credited in one particular or another, Walker's burden goes beyond merely setting McCarthy's testimony aside:  the burden was upon Walker to show affirmatively that McCarthy acted out of malice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the authorities say that one side cannot carry its affirmative burden of proof on a fact by pointing to the possibility that the jury disbelieved the other side's denial of the fact.

Likewise, Walker's claim that attorney's fees and costs should have been granted him under Rule 54(d) and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988 fails since he has obtained no relief at all.  The judgment in favor of WHA and McCarthy on all claims other than count IV is affirmed;  the judgment in favor of Walker and against McCarthy on count IV is reversed.
