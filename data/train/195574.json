Claimant, Ruben Rivera-Negron, \n                      \n\nchallenges the denial of disability benefits. \n\n            Mr.  Rivera-Negron  worked  in  various  laborer  and\n\ncarpentry jobs  for many years in Puerto  Rico and New York City.\n\nHe alleged an onset of disability  in November, 1990, due to  the\n\nafter effects of  an undisplaced fracture of  the big toe on  his\n\nleft  foot.  He maintained that because  of pain he was unable to\n\nwear heavy  shoes  required on  construction sites  where he  had\n\npreviously worked.  \n\n            The Administrative  Law Judge (ALJ)  found that  \"the\n\nclaimant did not have an impairment or combination of impairments\n\nwhich  . . . significantly  limited his ability  to perform basic\n\nwork-related  activities.\"   The ALJ,  therefore, terminated  the\n\nreview process at Step 2, or the severity stage, of the five-step\n\nsequential inquiry.  See  Bowen v. Yuckert, 482 U.S.  137 (1987).\n                                          \n\nThe  decision of  the  ALJ  became  the  final  decision  of  the\n\nSecretary when  the Appeals  Council denied review.  The claimant\n\nappealed to  the district court,  which affirmed the  decision of\n\nthe Secretary.  We also affirm.  \n\n            The  claimant  challenges  the ALJ's  finding  of  no\n\nsevere impairment. In  essence, the claimant argues  that the ALJ\n\nerred  in  his  application  of  the  threshold  test  of medical\n\nseverity which was enunciated in  McDonald v. Secretary of Health\n                                                                 \n\nand Human  Services, 795 F.2d 1118 (1st Cir. 1986).  In McDonald,\n                                                                 \n\nthis  court held that the Step 2  severity test is justified as a\n\n                               -2-\n\nde  minimis  screening  policy  and  that the  Secretary  is  not\n\nprecluded from implementing a  threshold test of medical severity\n\nto screen out  claims that  would clearly be  disallowed even  if\n\nvocational factors  were considered. Id. at 1121-1126.   See also\n                                                                 \n\nBowen v. Yuckert, 482 U.S. 137 (1987).\n                \n\n            The  State Insurance  Fund  concluded   claimant  had\n\nsuffered   a  \"[l]oss  of  50%   of  the  GPF  [general  physical\n\nfunctioning]  due to a  loss of the  large toe in  the left foot-\n\nsecondary articulation.\"  However, an examination  several months\n\nlater  in July 1991 found no remaining abnormality in the toe, no\n\nredness or swelling,  and full range of motion.   Notwithstanding\n\nclaimant's  complaints  of  cramps,  pain  and  an  inability  to\n\ntolerate  heavy  shoes or  work  boots, the  doctor  concluded no\n\ntreatment  was merited.     The ALJ  found claimant  unpersuasive\n\nregarding his inability to  wear heavy shoes, and gave  weight to\n\nthe  medical evidence indicating no loss of motion or other signs\n\nof abnormality  in the toe.   In  view of the  July 1991  medical\n\nreports  and  claimant's  sparse  treatment  history,  the  ALJ's\n\nfindings are justified and adequately supported by the record.\n\n            For  the  foregoing  reasons,  we   find  substantial\n\nevidence  to  support  the  Secretary's  determination  that  the\n\nclaimant  does   not  have  any  impairment   or  combination  of\n\nimpairments which  significantly  limits his  ability to  perform\n\nbasic  work-related  activities.   We  conclude  that review  was\n\nappropriately terminated at the  Step 2 severity level.   We have\n\n                               -3-\n\nconsidered  all of claimant's arguments and have found them to be\n\nwithout merit.\n\n            Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\n                          \n\n                               -4-\n",
