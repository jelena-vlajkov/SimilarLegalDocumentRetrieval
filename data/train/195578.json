Plaintiff-appellant  Jerry  William\n                     \n\nWeber,  a Maine  inmate,  filed a  pro  se complaint  in  the\n\ndistrict court, pursuant to 42  U.S.C.   1983, against Martin\n\nA.  Magnusson, the  warden of  the Maine  State Prison.   The\n\ncomplaint alleges violations of  Weber's right to free speech\n\nunder  the First Amendment and to  equal protection under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.  Appellee  Magnusson filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment with respect  to both claims.  On  March 16,\n\n1994,  a magistrate  judge (\"magistrate\")  granted appellee's\n\nmotion in its entirety.  This appeal followed.\n\n          We  have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the\n\nrecord on appeal.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of appellee  on the free  speech claim for  essentially\n\nthe reasons stated  by the  magistrate.  We  also affirm  the\n\ngrant of summary judgment  in favor of appellee on  the equal\n\nprotection claim.  Based on the undisputed facts, we think it\n\nis plain that the challenged regulation is reasonably related\n\nto a legitimate penal interest.  Moreover, to the extent that\n\nWeber's  affidavit and  documentary evidence  raise  an issue\n\nwhether  child  molesters  as   a  group  are  being  treated\n\ndifferently  from murderers  by prison  officials, they  also\n\ndemonstrate  that  the  explanation  for this  difference  in\n\ntreatment  is  rational  and  reasonably  related to  Maine's\n\nproper interest in protecting the security of inmates.  Under\n\nthe circumstances,  appellee is  entitled to judgment  on the\n\n                             -2-\n\nequal protection  claim as a  matter of  law.   See O'Bar  v.\n                                                         \n\nPinion, 953  F.2d  74, 81  (4th  Cir. 1991)  (observing  that\n      \n\n\"[t]he  state   may  apply  the  law   differently  based  on\n\ndistinctive  factual  circumstances  if  the  distinction  is\n\nrationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose\"). \n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -3-\n",
