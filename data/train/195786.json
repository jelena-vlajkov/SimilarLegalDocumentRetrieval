The judgment is affirmed substantially  for\r                           \n\nthe reasons recited  by the  district court  in its  decision\n\ndated  March 28, 1994.   It is worth  emphasizing what is not\r                                                                         \n\npresented by the instant appeal.   Plaintiff's constitutional\n\nargument  rests solely  on the Petition  Clause of  the First\n\nAmendment; he is not alleging  that New Hampshire law creates\n\na  liberty interest entitling him, as  a matter of procedural\n\ndue  process, to have his  petition articles submitted to the\n\nvoters at the school district meeting or  the subsequent town\n\nmeeting.  Cf. Montero  v. Meyer, 13 F.3d 1444,  1446-50 (10th\r                                           \n\nCir.)  (finding  no  liberty  interest  conferring  right  to\n\nparticipate in drafting of ballot initiative), cert.  denied,\r                                                                        \n\n115 S.  Ct. 231 (1994).   Nor are  we faced with  a situation\n\nwhere  the  moderator  (or  for  that  matter  the  board  of\n\nselectmen or the  school board) has elected  to withhold such\n\narticles entirely from the voters.  \n\n     Instead,  the  moderator in  each  instance  here, after\n\nruling that  plaintiff's articles were contrary  to state law\n\nand thus  would not  be voted  upon,  and after  entertaining\n\nargument  from  plaintiff,  called  for  a  vote  as  to  the\n\npropriety of this ruling.  It was the voters themselves--\"the\n\nvery  governmental   bodies  to   whom  the   petitions  were\n\naddressed,\"  as  the  district   court  noted--who  made  the\n\nultimate  decision not  to consider  the articles  because of\n\ntheir perceived  invalidity.   Plaintiff  thus  succeeded  in\n\n\"petitioning\" the voters; he simply failed to persuade  them.\n\nUnder  these  circumstances, it  is  apparent  that no  First\n\nAmendment violation occurred.  See, e.g., Minnesota Board for\r                                                                         \r\r\n\nCommunity Colleges v.
