Plaintiff,  Michael A.

The\r\n\ndistrict  court  concluded  that  Crooker   was  collaterally\r\n\nestopped  from asserting several of the Bivens claims.  As to\r                                                          \r\n\nthose Bivens claims not precluded by collateral estoppel, the\r                        \r\n\ndistrict   court   determined  that   the   items  had   been\r\n\nconstitutionally seized  as within the scope  of the warrant,\r\n\nin plain view, and/or Agent Varriale was not liable as he was\r\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.\r\n\n     Upon careful review,  we conclude that summary  judgment\r\n\nwas appropriate on all counts; although as to certain counts,\r\n\nwe  affirm on grounds different from the district court.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nFour  Corners Serv. Station, Inc. v.

We pass the issue of\r\n\ncollateral  estoppel, affirming,  instead, on  an alternative\r\n\nground of  qualified immunity, the grant  of summary judgment\r\n\non the counts deemed  precluded.  As to the  counts involving\r\n\nthe November  1991 seizure of  antique firearms and  the July\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n1992 seizure of  ammunition, Crooker has  failed to allege  a\r\n\nviolation of his own Fourth Amendment rights.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     The district court, in a comprehensive memorandum, dated\r\n\nOctober  26,  1994,  explained  the  factual  and  procedural\r\n\nbackground.   We  set out  an abbreviated  version, outlining\r\n\nonly  those facts  and  the procedural  history necessary  to\r\n\nexplain the basis for our determination.\r\n\n     Crooker was released from  prison in February 1991 after\r\n\nserving a 4-to-5 year state prison sentence for possession of\r\n\na machine  gun.    Pursuant  to  a  warrant,  Agent  Varriale\r\n\nsearched  Crooker's   residence  on  November  8,  1991,  for\r\n\nfirearms, ammunition,  and related material.   Agent Varriale\r\n\nseized, among  other things, several antique  and non-antique\r\n\nfirearms, numerous  rounds of ammunition, an  address book, a\r\n\nfirearms record card, and firearms publications.1\r\n\n     Crooker  was indicted  on charges  of being  a felon-in-\r\n\npossession of  firearms in violation  of 18 U.S.C.    922(g).\r\n\nIn this  criminal proceeding,  Crooker moved to  suppress the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  As noted  in our  opening paragraph,  there was a  second\r\nsearch  of  Crooker's  residence  conducted  in  July   1992.\r\nPursuant to a separate warrant issued in the course of an IRS\r\ninvestigation of Crooker for  filing false tax refund claims,\r\nAgent Varriale assisted IRS agents in executing the July 1992\r\nwarrant and seized ammunition from an antique firearm.\r\n     In  this Bivens  action,  Crooker does  not contest  the\r                                \r\nissuance of  the July 1992 warrant.   He claims only that the\r\nJuly 1992 warrant did not authorize or encompass a seizure of\r\nthat ammunition.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nevidence seized  in November  1991, arguing that  the warrant\r\n\nhad  been issued without probable cause and that items seized\r\n\nwere  outside  the  scope of  the  warrant.    The motion  to\r\n\nsuppress was denied by Chief Judge Tauro.\r\n\n     Thereafter, in exchange for  the dismissal of the felon-\r\n\nin-possession   indictment,  Crooker   pled   guilty  to   an\r\n\ninformation charging him with  conspiracy to possess firearms\r\n\nby  a  felon, in  violation  of  18 U.S.C.     371.   By  the\r\n\ndismissal  of  the  felon-in-possession  indictment,  Crooker\r\n\navoided  the  imposition  of  a  mandatory  15-year  term  of\r\n\nimprisonment.    The  parties  agreed  to,  and  Judge  Tauro\r\n\nimposed,  an  eight-year sentence  for  the  charge to  which\r\n\nCrooker pled guilty.\r\n\n     After  pleading guilty  in  his  criminal case,  Crooker\r\n\nmoved to lift  a stay that  had been entered  in his  earlier\r\n\nBivens action  against Agent  Varriale.   Some of the  Bivens\r                                                                         \r\n\nclaims  duplicated  the  allegations  forming  the  basis for\r\n\nCrooker's  suppression motion, i.e., that the application for\r\n\nthe 1991 search warrant included deliberate false statements,\r\n\nthat  the 1991 search  warrant was not  supported by probable\r\n\ncause, and that  the 1991  search exceeded the  scope of  the\r\n\nwarrant.  Relying  on Allen  v. McCurry, 449  U.S. 90  (1980)\r                                                   \r\n\n(collateral estoppel applies to   1983 actions), the district\r\n\ncourt  determined  in  the  Bivens action  that  Crooker  was\r                                              \r\n\ncollaterally estopped from relitigating the issues decided in\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nthe  suppression  ruling previously  entered in  the criminal\r\n\ncase.  The  district court granted summary judgment  in favor\r\n\nof  Agent  Varriale  as   to  the  remaining  Bivens  claims,\r                                                                \r\n\nconcluding  that the  items which were  the subject  of these\r\n\ncounts  were lawfully  seized  or detained  or  that, in  any\r\n\nevent, Agent Varriale was entitled to qualified immunity.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     Crooker  contends  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r\n\nconcluding  that he  is collaterally  estopped.  He  cites to\r\n\nHaring v. Prosise, 462  U.S. 306 (1983), for  the proposition\r                             \r\n\nthat entry of a guilty plea does not preclude a litigant from\r\n\nbringing a civil claim based  on a Fourth Amendment violation\r\n\narising out  of the same set of operative facts.  The Prosise\r                                                                         \r\n\nCourt held, inter alia, that since  a plea can be accepted on\r                                  \r\n\nthe basis of inadmissible evidence, the legality of  a search\r\n\nis not \"necessarily  determined\" by  a guilty plea.   Id.  at\r                                                                     \r\n\n316.    We need  not consider  whether  the issues  raised by\r\n\nCrooker were  precluded by  any adjudication in  the criminal\r\n\ncase,2  because we  affirm on  alternative grounds  -- namely\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  We  note, however, that the Prosise Court stated that one\r                                                   \r\nconcern  which  animated  its  decision  was  the  desire  to\r\npreserve judicial resources.  \"The rule [rejected in Prosise]\r                                                                        \r\nwould  require an  otherwise  unwilling party  to try  Fourth\r\nAmendment questions to the hilt and prevail in state court in\r\norder  to preserve the mere possibility of later bringing a  \r\n1983  claim in  federal court.\"   Prosise,  462 U.S.  at 322.\r                                                     \r\nFurther,  the Court noted that  in the case  before it, there\r\nwas  \"no   repetitive  use  of  judicial   resources  and  no\r\npossibility  of  inconsistent  decisions  that  could justify\r\nprecluding  the bringing of such  claims.\"  Id.  at 322 n.11.\r                                                           \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nqualified immunity  -- the district court's  grant of summary\r\n\njudgment on the counts it deemed precluded.

Station, Inc., 51 F.3d at 314 (appellate court is free\r                                \r\n\nto affirm on any ground supported by the record).\r\n\n     Qualified   immunity    shields   government   officials\r\n\nperforming discretionary  functions from liability  for civil\r\n\ndamages so long  as their conduct  \"does not violate  clearly\r\n\nestablished  statutory  or constitutional  rights of  which a\r\n\nreasonable  [police officer]  would have  known.\"   Harlow v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  The qualified immunity\r                      \r\n\ndefense sweeps  broadly,  protecting  \"all  but  the  plainly\r\n\nincompetent or those who knowingly  violate the law.\"  Hunter\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

As  this court recently\r                  \r\n\nexplained,\r\n\n          appellate   assessment  of   a  qualified\r\n          immunity  claim  is apportioned  into two\r\n          analytic components.  First, if the right\r\n          asserted  by  the plaintiff  was \"clearly\r\n          established\" at  the time of  its alleged\r\n          violation, we are required to assume that\r\n          the right was recognized by the defendant\r\n          official;  second,  we   will  deny   the\r\n          immunity claim if  a reasonable  official\r\n          situated in the same circumstances should\r\n          have   understood  that   the  challenged\r\n          conduct violated that established right.\r\n\nHegarty v.  Somerset County,  53 F.3d  1367,  1373 (1st  Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1995) (quoting Burns v.  Loranger, 907 F.2d 233,  235-36 (1st\r                                             \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nOf course, Crooker's litigation of the suppression motion did\r\nrequire the expenditure of scarce judicial resources.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nCir. 1990) (citations omitted)).  In the context of qualified\r\n\nimmunity, summary  judgment  is warranted  if  the  plaintiff\r\n\nfails  to generate  a  trialworthy issue  by undermining  the\r\n\nevidence  supporting  the  defendant   officer's  objectively\r\n\nreasonable  belief that  his actions  were lawful.   Dean  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nWorcester, 924 F.2d 364, 367 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                     \r\n\n     The rights which Crooker says were violated -- the right\r\n\nto  be free  from a  search conducted  pursuant to  a warrant\r\n\npremised on  deliberate misstatements,  the right to  be free\r\n\nfrom a search conducted pursuant to  a warrant unsupported by\r\n\nprobable cause  and the right  to be  free from a  search for\r\n\nitems not adequately described in  the warrant -- are clearly\r\n\nestablished.

Consequently,\r                                \r\n\nour  analysis  turns on  whether  a police  officer  in Agent\r\n\nVarriale's  position reasonably could  have believed that his\r\n\nactions did not violate those rights.  As regards the actions\r\n\nsurrounding   the   1991  search   warrant,   an  objectively\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nreasonable   officer  could  have  believed  that  Varriale's\r\n\nactions did not violate clearly established law.\r\n\n     Crooker contends that the following statement, submitted\r\n\nby Agent Varriale in support of the 1991 warrant application,\r\n\nwas deliberately false:\r\n\n          In  my  experience,   it  is  common  for\r\n          individuals   who  are   prohibited  from\r\n          legally possessing firearms--but who wish\r\n          to do  so illegally--to have  a household\r\n          or  family  member  or  associate  who is\r\n          properly  licensed  to possess  firearms,\r\n          make purchases of firearms and ammunition\r\n          which  are  then  in  fact  used  by  the\r\n          prohibited person.   In this way  persons\r\n          who    are   prohibited    from   legally\r\n          possessing firearms are  able to  possess\r\n          firearms without creating  any record  of\r\n          transactions in  their name.  Based on my\r\n          training and experience,  I believe  that\r\n          such  a ruse  is likely  where, as  here,\r\n          significant  amounts  of  ammunition  are\r\n          being  received  through mail  orders and\r\n          the purchasing party  need not appear  in\r\n          person.\r\n\nCrooker argues that this statement is false because it is not\r\n\n\"common\"  for  prohibited  individuals  to  buy  firearms and\r\n\nammunition  through family  members  and that  the amount  of\r\n\nammunition  bought was  not  \"significant.\"   He proposed  to\r\n\ndemonstrate that such schemes were not \"common,\" by comparing\r\n\nthe  large number of lawful  gun owners in  the United States\r\n\nwith the small number of  \"straw-purchasing\" schemes detected\r\n\neach year by  law enforcement.3   And he  contended that  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Crooker  neither   produced  such  data,   nor  requested\r\nadditional time within which to  do so.  See Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r                                                        \r\n56(f).\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\namount   of   ammunition  purchased   could  not   be  termed\r\n\n\"significant\"  when compared with the 2,000 - 6,000 pounds of\r\n\nammunition Crooker's supplier shipped daily.\r\n\n     Crooker's  claims  fall   far  short  of   generating  a\r\n\ntrialworthy dispute as to whether Agent Varriale deliberately\r\n\nsupported  his warrant  application  with false  information.\r\n\nRather,  his argument amounts to  little more than a semantic\r\n\ngame.  Crooker produced absolutely no evidence  to refute the\r\n\nstatement  that  Agent  Varriale,  based  on his  experience,\r\n\nconsidered firearms purchases by close family members to be a\r\n\ncommon  method  by which  prohibited  individuals attempt  to\r\n\nacquire firearms illegally.   A law enforcement officer, with\r\n\nexperience in such matters,  could reasonably conclude that a\r\n\nparticular pattern of criminal  behavior was \"common\" without\r\n\nundertaking a  statistical analysis encompassing  all firearm\r\n\npurchases in  the United  States.   And a reasonable  officer\r\n\nreasonably  could  conclude  that  the  fifty-one  boxes   of\r\n\nammunition which were delivered to Crooker's residence during\r\n\nthe previous four months  represented a \"significant\"  amount\r\n\nof ammunition.\r\n\n     Crooker's  second  claim  is  that  the  search  of  his\r\n\npremises  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment because  the  1991\r\n\nsearch warrant  was not  supported by  probable cause.   Once\r\n\nagain,  we inquire  whether  a reasonable  officer, in  Agent\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nVarriale's position, reasonably  could have  believed that  a\r\n\nsearch did not violate Crooker's rights.\r\n\n     In  United States  v.  Leon, 468  U.S.  897 (1984),  the\r                                            \r\n\nSupreme  Court held  that  evidence seized  under an  invalid\r\n\nwarrant, believed in good  faith to be valid by  the officers\r\n\nwho  executed   it,  should  not  be   suppressed  under  the\r\n\nexclusionary rule.   Leon explicitly noted  that the standard\r                                     \r\n\nof \"objective reasonableness\"  used in assessing a  qualified\r                                                                         \r\n\nimmunity defense  should be  used to determine  when evidence\r                            \r\n\nseized  under  a  technically  invalid  warrant,  should   be\r\n\nexcluded.  Id. at 922.  The Court stated,\r                          \r\n\n          [I]n most  such cases, there is no police\r                                                               \r\n          illegality and thus nothing to deter. . .\r                                \r\n          .

Briggs, 475 U.S. 335 (1986), the Court made\r                                    \r\n\nclear  that the Leon analysis serves as well in the qualified\r                                \r\n\nimmunity  analysis  applicable  to  police  officers  in  the\r\n\nposition of Agent Varriale.\r\n\n          [W]e  hold  that  the  same  standard  of\r\n          objective reasonableness  that we applied\r\n          in  the context of  a suppression hearing\r\n          in Leon, [468  U.S. 897 (1984),]  defines\r                             \r\n          the   qualified   immunity  accorded   an\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\n          officer  whose  request  for   a  warrant\r\n          allegedly   caused  an   unconstitutional\r\n          arrest.      Only   where   the   warrant\r\n          application is so  lacking in indicia  of\r\n          probable  cause  as  to  render  official\r\n          belief  in  its  existence  unreasonable,\r\n          Leon,  [468 U.S.] at 923, will the shield\r                          \r\n          of immunity be lost.\r\n\nId. at 344-45 (footnote omitted).\r               \r\n\n     The  Leon Court  set  forth three  circumstances wherein\r                          \r\n\ngood-faith  reliance  upon  a neutral  magistrate's  probable\r\n\ncause  determination   could  not   be  found.     First,  in\r\n\ncircumstances  where  the  police  submitted   affidavits  in\r\n\nsupport  of  the warrant  application,  which  they knew,  or\r\n\nshould have known,  were false.  Id.  at 923.  The  affidavit\r                                                \r\n\nsubmitted in support of the 1991 search  warrant contained no\r\n\nsuch statements.  Second,  the police cannot place good-faith\r\n\nreliance  upon  a  warrant issued  by  a  magistrate who  has\r\n\n\"wholly  abandoned his judicial role.\"  Id.  There is no such\r                                                       \r\n\nsuggestion in  this case.   Third,  the police  cannot assert\r\n\ngood-faith  reliance on a warrant  issued on the  basis of an\r\n\napplication  which was  \"so  facially deficient  -- i.e.,  in\r                                                                    \r\n\nfailing  to particularize  the  place to  be searched  or the\r\n\nthings to  be seized  -- that  the executing officers  cannot\r\n\nreasonably presume it  to be valid.\"   Id.  The  1991 warrant\r                                                      \r\n\nissued for  Crooker's residence  was entirely regular  on its\r\n\nface.   Consequently,  in  executing the  1991 warrant  Agent\r\n\nVarriale was  entitled to place good-faith  reliance upon the\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nsearch  warrant,  as  an  objectively  reasonable  basis  for\r\n\nexecuting the warranted search of Crooker's residence.\r\n\n     Crooker's third  claim is  that the search  conducted by\r\n\nAgent  Varriale exceeded  the  scope  of  the warrant.    The\r\n\nwarrant  authorized a  search for  \"ammunition  and firearms,\r\n\npossession  of  which constitute  a  violation  of Title  18,\r\n\nUnited  States Code,  Section  922(g),  firearms  maintenance\r\n\nequipment, records of  purchases, deliveries and receipts  of\r\n\nfirearms and ammunition, including  invoices, bills of sale .\r\n\n. . and correspondence which constitute evidence of violation\r\n\nof [18 U.S.C.   922(g)].\"\r\n\n     Crooker  first  contends  that  seizure  of  the  modern\r\n\nfirearms was outside the scope of the warrant, because  Agent\r\n\nVarriale  did not  have probable  cause to  believe that  the\r\n\nfirearms actually  belonged to him (and  hence were possessed\r\n\nin  violation of   922(g)) and not Susan Bartnicki, with whom\r\n\nhe was living  at the time of  the November 1991 search  (and\r\n\nwho   was  not   barred   from  possession   by      922(g)).\r\n\nNonetheless, a  reasonable officer could reach the conclusion\r\n\nthat the firearms were possessed by Crooker based upon 1) the\r\n\nfact that Crooker had signed for and tendered the payment for\r\n\nten boxes of ammunition,  2) the fact that the  firearms were\r\n\nwithin  Crooker's residence and 3)  the fact that  the key to\r\n\nthe gun safe was hanging in Crooker's bedroom.\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\n     Crooker  also  contends  that  the  seizure  of  antique\r\n\nfirearms was outside  the scope of the warrant,  because they\r\n\nare not  within the  purview of    922(g).   See 18  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n921(a)(3), (16) (defining antique firearms and exempting same\r\n\nfrom definition  of \"firearms\"  regulated under    922).   We\r\n\naffirm  summary judgment  for  Agent Varriale  on this  count\r\n\nbecause,  in any event, Crooker  did not allege any violation\r\n\nof  his Fourth Amendment right with respect to the seizure of\r                   \r\n\nthe antique firearms.   \"Fourth Amendment rights are personal\r\n\nrights which, like some  other constitutional rights, may not\r\n\nbe  vicariously asserted.\"   Alderman  v. United  States, 394\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  165, 174  (1967).   The Fourth  Amendment's prohibition\r\n\nagainst  unreasonable seizures protects a possessory interest\r\n\nin  property.    \"[A]  seizure  deprives  the  individual  of\r\n\ndominion  over his  or her  person or  property.\"   Horton v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCalifornia, 496 U.S.  128, 133 (1990).4  Although Crooker has\r                      \r\n\nclaimed  that, even as a convicted felon, he may lawfully own\r\n\nand possess antique firearms, he alleged in the Bivens \"Third\r                                                                  \r\n\nAmended  Complaint\"  that  the  particular  antique  firearms\r\n\nseized  pursuant to  the  November 1991  warrant belonged  to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Of  course, the  Fourth  Amendment also  protects against\r\nunreasonable searches.  \"A  search compromises the individual\r\ninterest in  privacy.\"  Horton, 496 U.S. at 128.  Crooker had\r                                          \r\na legitimate expectation in  the privacy of his home.  As the\r\nsearching officers had a  valid search warrant and discovered\r\nthe antique firearms  during the  course of,  and within  the\r\npermissible  scope of,  their  authorized  search for  modern\r\nfirearms,   however,  Crooker's  privacy   interest  was  not\r\nviolated.\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nBartnicki,  who is not a party to this complaint.  Similarly,\r\n\nCrooker  may not complain about the seizure of the ammunition\r\n\ntaken from an antique  firearm during the course of  the July\r\n\n1992  search  as  he  has  alleged  that  that  firearm   and\r\n\nammunition belonged to Bartnicki.5\r\n\n     As to the remaining items seized under the 1991 warrant,\r\n\nwe agree with the district court.6  The address book and  the\r\n\nfirearms record card and handwritten notes were either within\r\n\nthe scope  of the warrant authorizing the seizure of \"records\r\n\nof  purchases,  deliveries  and  receipts  of  firearms   and\r\n\nammunition, including .  . . correspondence  which constitute\r\n\nevidence  of  violation  of  Title 18,  United  States  Code,\r\n\nSection 922(g)\" or legitimately seized as being within \"plain\r\n\nview.\"  We further  agree that, in any event,  Agent Varriale\r\n\nwas  entitled  to  qualified  immunity because  a  reasonable\r\n\nofficer in Varriale's position  could so believe.  Similarly,\r\n\nwe conclude  that the legal papers  and firearms publications\r\n\n(counts which  the district court found  barred by collateral\r\n\nestoppel) were constitutionally seized as within the scope of\r\n\nthe  warrant, in  plain view,  or that,  in any  event, Agent\r\n\nVarriale is entitled to qualified immunity.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Crooker was never charged in his criminal proceeding with\r\nthe unlawful possession of any of the antique firearms seized\r\nin November 1991 or the ammunition seized in July 1992.\r\n\n6.  We also  agree with the district  court's conclusion with\r\nrespect  to  Crooker's complaint  about  the  detention of  a\r\npackage from Shooter's Equipment Company.\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\n     Finally, although not raised as a  separate count in his\r\n\nBivens  complaint, during  the course  of the  district court\r                  \r\n\nproceedings Crooker  complained about the  retention of items\r\n\nseized.   Whether  Agent Varriale was  personally responsible\r                                                             \r\n\nfor the retention of the items and had authority to order the\r                             \r\n\nreturn of items taken in the search  and, thus, is the proper\r\n\ndefendant  with respect  to such  a claim  is of  some doubt.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Go-Bart Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344, 354-55\r                                                   \r\n\n(1931) (reciting that because  the United States Attorney had\r\n\ncontrol  of  the prosecution,  the  papers  seized were  held\r\n\nsubject  to  his  control  and  direction,  although  in  the\r\n\nimmediate care and  custody of the officer  who seized them);\r\n\nThompson  v.   Williamson,  962  F.2d  12   (8th  Cir.  1992)\r                                     \r\n\n(unpublished  per  curiam)  (affirming  summary  judgment  in\r\n\nBivens  action seeking  return  of property  in favor  of FBI\r                  \r\n\nagent who alleged  that he could not release property without\r\n\napproval of AUSA).  In any event,  Crooker has not been clear\r\n\nas to which items he refers.   He, of course, is not entitled\r\n\nto the return of  any contraband.  And, insofar as Crooker is\r\n\nreferring to the antique firearms seized in November 1991 and\r\n\nthe  ammunition seized  in  July 1992,  Crooker's failure  to\r\n\nestablish that  he is the rightful owner,  see supra, defeats\r                                                                \r\n\nthis  claim.   Finally,  insofar as  he  may be  referring to\r\n\npersonal  papers, Crooker  now states  that his  property has\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\nbeen returned.   We conclude, therefore,  that this claim  is\r\n\nmoot.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n",

The district court concluded that Crooker was collaterally estopped from asserting several of the Bivens claims.  As to those Bivens claims not precluded by collateral estoppel, the district court determined that the items had been constitutionally seized as within the scope of the warrant, in plain view, and/or Agent Varriale was not liable as he was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon careful review, we conclude that summary judgment was appropriate on all counts;  although as to certain counts, we affirm on grounds different from the district court.

We pass the issue of collateral estoppel, affirming, instead, on an alternative ground of qualified immunity, the grant of summary judgment on the counts deemed precluded.

Pursuant to a warrant, Agent Varriale searched Crooker's residence on November 8, 1991, for firearms, ammunition, and related material.  Agent Varriale seized, among other things, several antique and non-antique firearms, numerous rounds of ammunition, an address book, a firearms record card, and firearms publications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker was indicted on charges of being a felon-in-possession of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g).  In this criminal proceeding, Crooker moved to suppress the evidence seized in November 1991, arguing that the warrant had been issued without probable cause and that items seized were outside the scope of the warrant.  The motion to suppress was denied by Chief Judge Tauro.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in exchange for the dismissal of the felon-in-possession indictment, Crooker pled guilty to an information charging him with conspiracy to possess firearms by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371.  By the dismissal of the felon-in-possession indictment, Crooker avoided the imposition of a mandatory 15-year term of imprisonment.  The parties agreed to, and Judge Tauro imposed, an eight-year sentence for the charge to which Crooker pled guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After pleading guilty in his criminal case, Crooker moved to lift a stay that had been entered in his earlier Bivens action against Agent Varriale.  Some of the Bivens claims duplicated the allegations forming the basis for Crooker's suppression motion, i.e., that the application for the 1991 search warrant included deliberate false statements, that the 1991 search warrant was not supported by probable cause, and that the 1991 search exceeded the scope of the warrant.  Relying on Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90 (1980) (collateral estoppel applies to Sec. 1983 actions), the district court determined in the Bivens action that Crooker was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issues decided in the suppression ruling previously entered in the criminal case.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Agent Varriale as to the remaining Bivens claims, concluding that the items which were the subject of these counts were lawfully seized or detained or that, in any event, Agent Varriale was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker contends that the district court erred in concluding that he is collaterally estopped.  He cites to Haring v. Prosise, 462 U.S. 306 (1983), for the proposition that entry of a guilty plea does not preclude a litigant from bringing a civil claim based on a Fourth Amendment violation arising out of the same set of operative facts.  The Prosise Court held, inter alia, that since a plea can be accepted on the basis of inadmissible evidence, the legality of a search is not \"necessarily determined\" by a guilty plea.  Id. at 316.  We need not consider whether the issues raised by Crooker were precluded by any adjudication in the criminal case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> because we affirm on alternative grounds--namely qualified immunity--the district court's grant of summary judgment on the counts it deemed precluded.  See Four Corners Serv.

First, if the right asserted by the plaintiff was \"clearly established\" at the time of its alleged violation, we are required to assume that the right was recognized by the defendant official;  second, we will deny the immunity claim if a reasonable official situated in the same circumstances should have understood that the challenged conduct violated that established right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hegarty v.

In the context of qualified immunity, summary judgment is warranted if the plaintiff fails to generate a trialworthy issue by undermining the evidence supporting the defendant officer's objectively reasonable belief that his actions were lawful.  Dean v. Worcester, 924 F.2d 364, 367 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rights which Crooker says were violated--the right to be free from a search conducted pursuant to a warrant premised on deliberate misstatements, the right to be free from a search conducted pursuant to a warrant unsupported by probable cause and the right to be free from a search for items not adequately described in the warrant--are clearly established.  Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 164-65 (1978) (reciting that the Fourth Amendment demands a factual showing sufficient to comprise probable cause and demands that it be a truthful showing);  Krohn v. United States, 742 F.2d 24, 26 (1st Cir.1984) (same);  Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 55 (1967) (reciting the Fourth Amendment's requirement that a warrant particularly describe the things to be seized);  United States v. Morris, 977 F.2d 677, 681 (1st Cir.1992) (same), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 1588 (1993).  Consequently, our analysis turns on whether a police officer in Agent Varriale's position reasonably could have believed that his actions did not violate those rights.  As regards the actions surrounding the 1991 search warrant, an objectively reasonable officer could have believed that Varriale's actions did not violate clearly established law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker contends that the following statement, submitted by Agent Varriale in support of the 1991 warrant application, was deliberately false:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>In my experience, it is common for individuals who are prohibited from legally possessing firearms--but who wish to do so illegally--to have a household or family member or associate who is properly licensed to possess firearms, make purchases of firearms and ammunition which are then in fact used by the prohibited person.  In this way persons who are prohibited from legally possessing firearms are able to possess firearms without creating any record of transactions in their name.  Based on my training and experience, I believe that such a ruse is likely where, as here, significant amounts of ammunition are being received through mail orders and the purchasing party need not appear in person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker argues that this statement is false because it is not \"common\" for prohibited individuals to buy firearms and ammunition through family members and that the amount of ammunition bought was not \"significant.\"   He proposed to demonstrate that such schemes were not \"common,\" by comparing the large number of lawful gun owners in the United States with the small number of \"straw-purchasing\" schemes detected each year by law enforcement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And he contended that the amount of ammunition purchased could not be termed \"significant\" when compared with the 2,000--6,000 pounds of ammunition Crooker's supplier shipped daily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker's claims fall far short of generating a trialworthy dispute as to whether Agent Varriale deliberately supported his warrant application with false information.  Rather, his argument amounts to little more than a semantic game.  Crooker produced absolutely no evidence to refute the statement that Agent Varriale, based on his experience, considered firearms purchases by close family members to be a common method by which prohibited individuals attempt to acquire firearms illegally.  A law enforcement officer, with experience in such matters, could reasonably conclude that a particular pattern of criminal behavior was \"common\" without undertaking a statistical analysis encompassing all firearm purchases in the United States.  And a reasonable officer reasonably could conclude that the fifty-one boxes of ammunition which were delivered to Crooker's residence during the previous four months represented a \"significant\" amount of ammunition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker's second claim is that the search of his premises violated the Fourth Amendment because the 1991 search warrant was not supported by probable cause.  Once again, we inquire whether a reasonable officer, in Agent Varriale's position, reasonably could have believed that a search did not violate Crooker's rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), the Supreme Court held that evidence seized under an invalid warrant, believed in good faith to be valid by the officers who executed it, should not be suppressed under the exclusionary rule.  Leon explicitly noted that the standard of \"objective reasonableness\" used in assessing a qualified immunity defense should be used to determine when evidence seized under a technically invalid warrant, should be excluded.  Id. at 922.  The Court stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[I]n most such cases, there is no police illegality and thus nothing to deter....

'[O]nce the warrant issues, there is literally nothing more the policeman can do in seeking to comply with the law.'  Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 498 (1976) (Burger, C.J.concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 921 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Malley v.

Only where the warrant application is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable, Leon, [468 U.S.] at 923, will the shield of immunity be lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 344-45 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Leon Court set forth three circumstances wherein good-faith reliance upon a neutral magistrate's probable cause determination could not be found.  First, in circumstances where the police submitted affidavits in support of the warrant application, which they knew, or should have known, were false.  Id. at 923.  The affidavit submitted in support of the 1991 search warrant contained no such statements.  Second, the police cannot place good-faith reliance upon a warrant issued by a magistrate who has \"wholly abandoned his judicial role.\"   Id. There is no such suggestion in this case.  Third, the police cannot assert good-faith reliance on a warrant issued on the basis of an application which was \"so facially deficient--i.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized--that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\"   Id. The 1991 warrant issued for Crooker's residence was entirely regular on its face.  Consequently, in executing the 1991 warrant Agent Varriale was entitled to place good-faith reliance upon the search warrant, as an objectively reasonable basis for executing the warranted search of Crooker's residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker's third claim is that the search conducted by Agent Varriale exceeded the scope of the warrant.  The warrant authorized a search for \"ammunition and firearms, possession of which constitute a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g), firearms maintenance equipment, records of purchases, deliveries and receipts of firearms and ammunition, including invoices, bills of sale ... and correspondence which constitute evidence of violation of [18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g) ].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker first contends that seizure of the modern firearms was outside the scope of the warrant, because Agent Varriale did not have probable cause to believe that the firearms actually belonged to him (and hence were possessed in violation of Sec. 922(g)) and not Susan Bartnicki, with whom he was living at the time of the November 1991 search (and who was not barred from possession by Sec. 922(g)).  Nonetheless, a reasonable officer could reach the conclusion that the firearms were possessed by Crooker based upon 1) the fact that Crooker had signed for and tendered the payment for ten boxes of ammunition, 2) the fact that the firearms were within Crooker's residence and 3) the fact that the key to the gun safe was hanging in Crooker's bedroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker also contends that the seizure of antique firearms was outside the scope of the warrant, because they are not within the purview of Sec. 922(g).  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 921(a)(3), (16) (defining antique firearms and exempting same from definition of \"firearms\" regulated under Sec. 922).  We affirm summary judgment for Agent Varriale on this count because, in any event, Crooker did not allege any violation of his Fourth Amendment right with respect to the seizure of the antique firearms.  \"Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted.\"  Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 174 (1967).  The Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures protects a possessory interest in property.  \"[A] seizure deprives the individual of dominion over his or her person or property.\"  Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 133 (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Although Crooker has claimed that, even as a convicted felon, he may lawfully own and possess antique firearms, he alleged in the Bivens \"Third Amended Complaint\" that the particular antique firearms seized pursuant to the November 1991 warrant belonged to Bartnicki, who is not a party to this complaint.  Similarly, Crooker may not complain about the seizure of the ammunition taken from an antique firearm during the course of the July 1992 search as he has alleged that that firearm and ammunition belonged to Bartnicki.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the remaining items seized under the 1991 warrant, we agree with the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The address book and the firearms record card and handwritten notes were either within the scope of the warrant authorizing the seizure of \"records of purchases, deliveries and receipts of firearms and ammunition, including ... correspondence which constitute evidence of violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g)\" or legitimately seized as being within \"plain view.\"   We further agree that, in any event, Agent Varriale was entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable officer in Varriale's position could so believe.  Similarly, we conclude that the legal papers and firearms publications (counts which the district court found barred by collateral estoppel) were constitutionally seized as within the scope of the warrant, in plain view, or that, in any event, Agent Varriale is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although not raised as a separate count in his Bivens complaint, during the course of the district court proceedings Crooker complained about the retention of items seized.  Whether Agent Varriale was personally responsible for the retention of the items and had authority to order the return of items taken in the search and, thus, is the proper defendant with respect to such a claim is of some doubt.  See, e.g., Go-Bart Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344, 354-55 (1931) (reciting that because the United States Attorney had control of the prosecution, the papers seized were held subject to his control and direction, although in the immediate care and custody of the officer who seized them);  Thompson v. Williamson, 962 F.2d 12 (8th Cir.1992) (unpublished per curiam) (affirming summary judgment in Bivens action seeking return of property in favor of FBI agent who alleged that he could not release property without approval of AUSA).  In any event, Crooker has not been clear as to which items he refers.  He, of course, is not entitled to the return of any contraband.  And, insofar as Crooker is referring to the antique firearms seized in November 1991 and the ammunition seized in July 1992, Crooker's failure to establish that he is the rightful owner, see supra, defeats this claim.  Finally, insofar as he may be referring to personal papers, Crooker now states that his property has been returned.  We conclude, therefore, that this claim is moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As noted in our opening paragraph, there was a second search of Crooker's residence conducted in July 1992.  Pursuant to a separate warrant issued in the course of an IRS investigation of Crooker for filing false tax refund claims, Agent Varriale assisted IRS agents in executing the July 1992 warrant and seized ammunition from an antique firearm</p>\n        <p>In this Bivens action, Crooker does not contest the issuance of the July 1992 warrant.  He claims only that the July 1992 warrant did not authorize or encompass a seizure of that ammunition.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note, however, that the Prosise Court stated that one concern which animated its decision was the desire to preserve judicial resources.  \"The rule [rejected in Prosise ] would require an otherwise unwilling party to try Fourth Amendment questions to the hilt and prevail in state court in order to preserve the mere possibility of later bringing a Sec. 1983 claim in federal court.\"  Prosise, 462 U.S. at 322.  Further, the Court noted that in the case before it, there was \"no repetitive use of judicial resources and no possibility of inconsistent decisions that could justify precluding the bringing of such claims.\"  Id. at 322 n. 11.  Of course, Crooker's litigation of the suppression motion did require the expenditure of scarce judicial resources</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Crooker neither produced such data, nor requested additional time within which to do so.

Crooker had a legitimate expectation in the privacy of his home.  As the searching officers had a valid search warrant and discovered the antique firearms during the course of, and within the permissible scope of, their authorized search for modern firearms, however, Crooker's privacy interest was not violated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Crooker was never charged in his criminal proceeding with the unlawful possession of any of the antique firearms seized in November 1991 or the ammunition seized in July 1992</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We also agree with the district court's conclusion with respect to Crooker's complaint about the detention of a package from Shooter's Equipment Company</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Pursuant to a warrant, Agent Varriale searched Crooker's residence on November 8, 1991, for firearms, ammunition, and related material.  Agent Varriale seized, among other things, several antique and non-antique firearms, numerous rounds of ammunition, an address book, a firearms record card, and firearms publications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker was indicted on charges of being a felon-in-possession of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C.

In this criminal proceeding, Crooker moved to suppress the evidence seized in November 1991, arguing that the warrant had been issued without probable cause and that items seized were outside the scope of the warrant.

Consequently, our analysis turns on whether a police officer in Agent Varriale's position reasonably could have believed that his actions did not violate those rights.  As regards the actions surrounding the 1991 search warrant, an objectively reasonable officer could have believed that Varriale's actions did not violate clearly established law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker contends that the following statement, submitted by Agent Varriale in support of the 1991 warrant application, was deliberately false:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>In my experience, it is common for individuals who are prohibited from legally possessing firearms--but who wish to do so illegally--to have a household or family member or associate who is properly licensed to possess firearms, make purchases of firearms and ammunition which are then in fact used by the prohibited person.  In this way persons who are prohibited from legally possessing firearms are able to possess firearms without creating any record of transactions in their name.  Based on my training and experience, I believe that such a ruse is likely where, as here, significant amounts of ammunition are being received through mail orders and the purchasing party need not appear in person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker argues that this statement is false because it is not \"common\" for prohibited individuals to buy firearms and ammunition through family members and that the amount of ammunition bought was not \"significant.\"   He proposed to demonstrate that such schemes were not \"common,\" by comparing the large number of lawful gun owners in the United States with the small number of \"straw-purchasing\" schemes detected each year by law enforcement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And he contended that the amount of ammunition purchased could not be termed \"significant\" when compared with the 2,000--6,000 pounds of ammunition Crooker's supplier shipped daily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker's claims fall far short of generating a trialworthy dispute as to whether Agent Varriale deliberately supported his warrant application with false information.  Rather, his argument amounts to little more than a semantic game.  Crooker produced absolutely no evidence to refute the statement that Agent Varriale, based on his experience, considered firearms purchases by close family members to be a common method by which prohibited individuals attempt to acquire firearms illegally.  A law enforcement officer, with experience in such matters, could reasonably conclude that a particular pattern of criminal behavior was \"common\" without undertaking a statistical analysis encompassing all firearm purchases in the United States.  And a reasonable officer reasonably could conclude that the fifty-one boxes of ammunition which were delivered to Crooker's residence during the previous four months represented a \"significant\" amount of ammunition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker's second claim is that the search of his premises violated the Fourth Amendment because the 1991 search warrant was not supported by probable cause.  Once again, we inquire whether a reasonable officer, in Agent Varriale's position, reasonably could have believed that a search did not violate Crooker's rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

First, in circumstances where the police submitted affidavits in support of the warrant application, which they knew, or should have known, were false.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 923. </a></span> The affidavit submitted in support of the 1991 search warrant contained no such statements.  Second, the police cannot place good-faith reliance upon a warrant issued by a magistrate who has \"wholly abandoned his judicial role.\"   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> There is </a></span>no such suggestion in this case.  Third, the police cannot assert good-faith reliance on a warrant issued on the basis of an application which was \"so facially deficient--i.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized--that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\"   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> The 1991 </a></span>warrant issued for Crooker's residence was entirely regular on its face.  Consequently, in executing the 1991 warrant Agent Varriale was entitled to place good-faith reliance upon the search warrant, as an objectively reasonable basis for executing the warranted search of Crooker's residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker's third claim is that the search conducted by Agent Varriale exceeded the scope of the warrant.  The warrant authorized a search for \"ammunition and firearms, possession of which constitute a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g), firearms maintenance equipment, records of purchases, deliveries and receipts of firearms and ammunition, including invoices, bills of sale ... and correspondence which constitute evidence of violation of [18 U.S.C.

Nonetheless, a reasonable officer could reach the conclusion that the firearms were possessed by Crooker based upon 1) the fact that Crooker had signed for and tendered the payment for ten boxes of ammunition, 2) the fact that the firearms were within Crooker's residence and 3) the fact that the key to the gun safe was hanging in Crooker's bedroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crooker also contends that the seizure of antique firearms was outside the scope of the warrant, because they are not within the purview of Sec. 922(g).  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 921(a)(3), (16) (defining antique firearms and exempting same from definition of \"firearms\" regulated under Sec. 922).  We affirm summary judgment for Agent Varriale on this count because, in any event, Crooker did not allege any violation of his Fourth Amendment right with respect to the seizure of the antique firearms.  \"Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted.\"  Alderman v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></span>, 174 (1967).  The Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures protects a possessory interest in property.  \"[A] seizure deprives the individual of dominion over his or her person or property.\"  Horton v.

Similarly, Crooker may not complain about the seizure of the ammunition taken from an antique firearm during the course of the July 1992 search as he has alleged that that firearm and ammunition belonged to Bartnicki.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the remaining items seized under the 1991 warrant, we agree with the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The address book and the firearms record card and handwritten notes were either within the scope of the warrant authorizing the seizure of \"records of purchases, deliveries and receipts of firearms and ammunition, including ... correspondence which constitute evidence of violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g)\" or legitimately seized as being within \"plain view.\"   We further agree that, in any event, Agent Varriale was entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable officer in Varriale's position could so believe.  Similarly, we conclude that the legal papers and firearms publications (counts which the district court found barred by collateral estoppel) were constitutionally seized as within the scope of the warrant, in plain view, or that, in any event, Agent Varriale is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although not raised as a separate count in his Bivens complaint, during the course of the district court proceedings Crooker complained about the retention of items seized.  Whether Agent Varriale was personally responsible for the retention of the items and had authority to order the return of items taken in the search and, thus, is the proper defendant with respect to such a claim is of some doubt.  See, e.g., Go-Bart Co. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101643\"><a href=\"/opinion/101643/go-bart-importing-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 354-55 (1931) (reciting that because the United States Attorney had control of the prosecution, the papers seized were held subject to his control and direction, although in the immediate care and custody of the officer who seized them);  Thompson v.

In any event, Crooker has not been clear as to which items he refers.  He, of course, is not entitled to the return of any contraband.  And, insofar as Crooker is referring to the antique firearms seized in November 1991 and the ammunition seized in July 1992, Crooker's failure to establish that he is the rightful owner, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra</span>, defeats this claim.  Finally, insofar as he may be referring to personal papers, Crooker now states that his property has been returned.
