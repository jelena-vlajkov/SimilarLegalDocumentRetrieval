Mita Copystar  of\r                                                     \n\nAmerica, Inc.  (\"Mita\")  appeals from  the  district  court's\n\norder  granting  summary  judgment  and  issuing  a permanent\n\ninjunction in favor of Casas Office Machines, Inc. (\"Casas\").\n\nThe  action began  when Casas  sued Mita  and two  fictitious\n\ndefendants,  John Doe and Richard Roe,  in the Superior Court\n\nof Puerto Rico,  San Juan Part.  Organized  under the laws of\n\nCalifornia  and with its  principal place of  business in New\n\nJersey, Mita removed the action to the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico.  After removal, Casas,\n\nby  an amendment  to its  complaint, replaced  the fictitious\n\ndefendants with  two named defendants, Caguas  Copy, Inc. and\n\nOficentro  J.P., Inc.,  which,  like Casas,  are Puerto  Rico\n\ncorporations.  Complete diversity  of citizenship between the\n\nparties was thus destroyed, although this fact was not called\n\nto  the district court's attention at the time.  The district\n\ncourt  proceeded to deny  Mita's motions  to dismiss  and for\n\nsummary  judgment,  and  it  allowed  Casas's  motion  for  a\n\npermanent injunction enjoining Mita from impairing a contract\n\nentered into with Casas.  Now, for the  first time on appeal,\n\nMita  points out  the  jurisdictional problem  caused by  the\n\naddition of the nondiverse  parties.  Mita asks us  to vacate\n\nthe judgment below and order the district court to remand the\n\naction  to  the Superior  Court of  Puerto  Rico.   Mita also\n\nattacks the district court's  decision on the merits, arguing\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthat  summary judgment  was  improper and  that the  district\n\ncourt erred in granting the permanent injunction.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Incorporated   in  Puerto  Rico,  Casas  sells  and\n\ndistributes   office  and  photocopying   equipment  in  that\n\nCommonwealth.  In 1983, Casas entered into an  agreement with\n\nMita,  a supplier  of office  and photographic  equipment, to\n\ndistribute Mita products in Puerto Rico.  As noted, Mita is a\n\nCalifornia  corporation with its  principal place of business\n\nin  New  Jersey.   Following  a period  of  strained business\n\nrelations, Casas and Mita executed a second agreement in 1989\n\n(the \"1989 Agreement\") granting  Casas the exclusive right to\n\ndistribute Mita's  products in  the \"Greater San  Juan\" area.\n\nParagraph  5 of  the 1989  Agreement, however,  provided that\n\nCasas's inability to meet or exceed 85% of a set  sales quota\n\nwould result in termination  of the exclusivity provisions of\n\nthe contract.  Asserting that Casas had failed to achieve the\n\n85% threshold, Mita terminated Casas's exclusive distribution\n\nrights      but  retained  Casas  as  a  distributor      and\n\ndesignated  two new  distributors in  the \"Greater  San Juan\"\n\narea.  \n\n          Casas responded on February 1, 1991, by suing Mita,\n\nJohn  Doe, and Richard Roe1  in the Superior  Court of Puerto\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Paragraph 3 of Casas's complaint said:\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nRico,  San  Juan  Part.   Casas  alleged  that  (1) Mita  had\n\ndeprived  Casas of its  exclusive distribution rights without\n\njust cause  in violation of P.R.  Laws Ann. tit. 10,     278-\n\n278d 91976) (referred to in the complaint and hereinafter  as\n\n\"Law 75\"), (2)  defendants had conspired to  deprive Casas of\n\nits  right to sell and distribute Mita products, (3) Mita had\n\nimpaired  Casas's exclusive  distribution agreement,  and (4)\n\ndefendants   had   intentionally   interfered  with   Casas's\n\ncontractual relationship with Mita.  Casas sought preliminary\n\nand permanent injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages.\n\n          Alleging the existence  of diversity  jurisdiction,\n\nMita removed the  action to the United  States District court\n\nfor  the  District   of  Puerto  Rico   on  March  6,   1991.\n\nThereafter, Casas amended its  complaint twice.  An amendment\n\n                    \r                                \n\n          Codefendants John Doe and Richard Roe are\n          fictitious   names   used  to   refer  to\n          defendants  whose  names  are unknown  at\n          present.  Said defendants are the natural\n          persons and/or  corporate and/or judicial\n          entities  who  together  with  MITA  have\n          conspired,   with    knowledge   of   the\n          contractual relationship between MITA and\n          Casas,  to  deprive  the latter  of  said\n          contractual  relationship,  directly  and\n          indirectly interfering therewith, causing\n          the  damages  hereinafter  itemized.

By a second motion  to amend, brought on May 14,\n\n1992, Casas sought to  replace the fictitious defendants with\n\nCaguas  Copy,   Inc.  (\"Caguas\")  and  Oficentro  J.P.,  Inc.\n\n(\"Oficentro\")    the corporations that Mita had designated as\n\nnew  distributors   in  the   Greater  San  Juan   area  upon\n\nterminating Casas's exclusive distribution rights.

Count Five  alleged  that defendants  had  illicitly  and\ntortiously contracted  for the distribution of  Mita products\nin Puerto Rican  territories in which Mita had  granted Casas\nthe exclusive right to distribute its products. \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n(emphasis  added).  Four days  later, on May  18, 1992, Casas\n\nmoved the  district  court for  an  expedited review  of  its\n\nsecond  motion  to amend  its  complaint.   Such  review  was\n\nnecessary,  said  Casas,  because  Oficentro  was  under  the\n\nprotection  of the  United  States Bankruptcy  Court for  the\n\nDistrict  of  Puerto  Rico      which  had  ordered that  all\n\ncreditors file their  proof of  claims on or  before June  8,\n\n1992    and Casas could  not file a proof of claim  until its\n\nmotion to  amend was  granted.   The  district court  allowed\n\nCasas's second amendment in early June 1992.\n\n          In   the  meantime,  Mita  had  moved  for  summary\n\njudgment  on February 12, 1992.  It argued primarily that (1)\n\nMita did  not impair its contractual  relationship with Casas\n\nbecause  it merely enforced its rights under the terms of the\n\n1989  Agreement, (2) even if it were found that Mita impaired\n\nits contractual relationship with  Casas, Mita had just cause\n\nto do so,  and (3) Casas's suit  was barred by the  equitable\n\ndoctrine  of laches.  On March 16, 1992, Casas opposed Mita's\n\nmotion for  summary judgment, and brought  a cross-motion for\n\npartial interlocutory  summary judgment on its  Law 75 claims\n\n(Counts One and Three), renewing  its request for a permanent\n\ninjunction.3  Mita,  in turn,  filed, on April  13, 1992,  an\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  In  its  original  complaint,  Casas  had  requested  the\ndistrict court to \n\n          issue  a   permanent  injunction  against\n          Mita,  ordering it  [(1)]  to  cease  and\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nopposition to Casas's  cross-motion for  summary judgment  in\n\nwhich   it  maintained,  inter   alia,  that   (1)  permanent\r                                                 \n\ninjunctive  relief is  not available  under Law  75, and  (2)\n\nordering permanent  injunctive relief  in this case  would be\n\nunconstitutional.   Finally, in  a separate motion,  filed on\n\nJune 4, 1992, Mita sought to dismiss Casas's complaint on the\n\ngrounds that Casas had engaged in a fraud upon the court.\n\n          The United States magistrate judge  reviewed Mita's\n\nmotions  to dismiss  and  for summary  judgment,  as well  as\n\nCasas's cross-motion for summary  judgment.  In a  report and\n\nrecommendation  issued on  September 2, 1993,  the magistrate\n\njudge concluded that (1) Casas had not committed fraud on the\n\ncourt, (2) Casas  was not  barred by the  doctrine of  laches\n\nfrom pursuing its claims under Law  75, (3) Mita did not have\n\njust  cause  under  Law  75 to  terminate  Casas's  exclusive\n\ndistribution rights because it failed to demonstrate that the\n\nquota provision in the 1989  Agreement was reasonable at  the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n          desist  from  continuing  with  the  acts\n          which constitute impairment of  the terms\n          of the distribution relationship existing\n          between  it and  Casas,  . .  . [(2)]  to\n          abstain   from   appointing,    choosing,\n          designating   or   arranging  for   other\n          additional    distributors   and/or    in\n          substitution  of Casas[,] and . . . [(3)]\n          to   abstain   from  terminating   and/or\n          altering  the  distribution  relationship\n          existing   between    both   parties   or\n          performing any act or omission whatsoever\n          in  impairment  thereof, all  pursuant to\n          the provisions of Law 75.\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\ntime of Casas's  nonperformance, (4)  a permanent  injunction\n\nmay be  ordered under Law 75,  and (5) Mita  had impaired its\n\ncontractual  relationship  with  Casas.    Consequently,  the\n\nmagistrate judge  recommended that  the  district court  deny\n\nMita's motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, and grant\n\nCasas's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\n          In  its opinion  and  order filed  on November  18,\n\n1993,  the  district  court  adopted all  of  the  magistrate\n\njudge's  recommendations,  thereby  granting  Casas's  cross-\n\nmotion  for summary judgment on its Law 75 claims (Counts One\n\nand  Three).4    Casas   Office  Machines  v.  Mita  Copystar\r                                                                         \n\nMachines, 847 F. Supp. 981, 983 (D.P.R. 1993).  In a judgment\r                    \n\nentered  the  same  day,  the district  court  denied  Mita's\n\nmotions  to dismiss  and  for summary  judgment, and  granted\n\nCasas's motion for  an injunction permanently enjoining  Mita\n\nfrom  impairing  the  1989  Agreement  without  just  cause.5\r                                                                       \n\nMita,  pursuant to  28 U.S.C.    1292(a)(1)  (1988),6 appeals\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.

The district  court emphasized  in its opinion  and order\nthat  it  was  not  placing Mita  in  involuntary  servitude.\nAccording  to  the  district  court, Mita  could  impair  its\ncontractual relationship with Casas in the future if it could\ndemonstrate just cause for doing so.\n\n6.

Although\n\nMita raises this  issue for the first time  on appeal, we are\n\nobliged  to  address  it   because  a  defense  of   lack  of\n\njurisdiction over  the subject matter is  expressly preserved\n\nagainst waiver by Fed.

Alternatively,  if\r                                         \n\njurisdiction  was  indeed  defeated  by  the substitution  of\n\nCaguas and Oficentro after removal,  Casas asks us to restore\n\nit, nunc  pro  tunc,  by  dismissing  the  diversity-spoiling\r                               \n\ndefendants without prejudice.\r                                        \n\n                              A.\n\n          This   case   involves    no   federal    question.\n\nJurisdiction stands or  falls upon diversity of  citizenship.\n\nIt has long been settled that a \"lack of `complete diversity'\n\nbetween   the  parties   deprives   the  federal   courts  of\n\njurisdiction over the lawsuit.\"  Sweeney v.

There was  complete\n\ndiversity between  the parties on  March 6,  1991, when  Mita\n\nremoved the case  to federal  court: Casas is  a Puerto  Rico\n\ncorporation,  and Mita  was  incorporated in  California  and\n\nmaintains  its principal  place  of business  in New  Jersey.\n\nThat  the fictitious  defendants, John  Doe and  Richard Roe,\n\nmight reside in Puerto Rico     as suggested by Casas in  the\n\noriginal  complaint      was properly  disregarded  under  28\n\nU.S.C.    1441(a)  (1988), which  provides in  relevant part:\n\n\"For purposes of removal . . ., the citizenship of defendants\n\nsued  under fictitious  names shall  be disregarded.\"   After\n\nremoval,  however, Casas  replaced the  fictitious defendants\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nwith Caguas  and Oficentro, which were  clearly identified as\n\nPuerto  Rico corporations, like  Casas itself.   The issue is\n\nwhether  this  substitution,  which unquestionably  destroyed\n\ncomplete  diversity, also  defeated  federal  subject  matter\n\njurisdiction.  We hold that it did.    \n\n          Casas  argues that  as  diversity jurisdiction  was\n\nestablished at the commencement of the proceeding, it was not\n\nlater defeated by the mere naming of  the fictitious parties,\n\nwho were  dispensable,  not indispensable.

We think that,  had Congress decided  that federal\n\ncourts   could  retain  jurisdiction   over  cases  in  which\n\nplaintiffs  joined  or  substituted  dispensable,  nondiverse\n\ndefendants  after removal, it would have made that plain in  \n\n1447(e).        \n\n          This is not to say that it is unimportant whether a\n\nnondiverse  defendant  whom  a  plaintiff seeks  to  join  or\n\nsubstitute after removal  is dispensable or indispensable  to\n\nthe action.  If the  defendant is indispensable, the district\n\ncourt's choices are limited to denying joinder and dismissing\n\nthe action pursuant  to Fed. R. Civ. P. 19,  or else allowing\n\n                             -17-\r\r\n\njoinder and remanding the case to the state court pursuant to\n\n  1447(e).  See Yniques, 985 F.2d  at 1035.  If, on the other\r                                   \n\nhand, the  defendant is  dispensable, the district  court has\n\nthe options, pursuant  to   1447(e),  of denying joinder  and\n\ncontinuing  its  jurisdiction  over the  case,  or permitting\n\njoinder  and  remanding the  case to  state court.8   Id.

Casas asks us to  exercise this power here by dismissing\n\nCaguas and Oficentro without prejudice.  \r                                                  \n\n          Courts  may not,  of course,  dismiss indispensable\r                                                                         \n\nparties  from   an  action  in  order   to  preserve  federal\n\njurisdiction.    But,  contrary   to  Mita's  assertions,  we\n\nconclude that Caguas  and Oficentro are dispensable  parties.\n\nMita's principal  contention is that  Casas is barred  by the\n\ndoctrine of judicial estoppel  from asserting that Caguas and\n\nOficentro are dispensable parties  because Casas, in a motion\n\nrequesting relief from the automatic stay, represented to the\n\nUnited  States Bankruptcy  Court for  the District  of Puerto\n\nRico  that Oficentro  is  an indispensable  party.   In  that\n\nmotion, Casas argued in the bankruptcy court that:\n\n               2.

Judicial\n\nestoppel is a judge-made doctrine designed to prevent a party\n\nwho  plays \"fast  and  loose with  the  courts\" from  gaining\n\nunfair   advantage  through   the   deliberate  adoption   of\n\ninconsistent positions  in successive suits.   See Scarano v.\r                                                                      \n\nCentral R.R. Co., 203 F.2d 510, 513 (3d Cir. 1953).  Here, it\r                            \n\ndoes not appear that Casas succeeded in gaining any advantage\n\nas a result of its earlier inconsistent statement made to the\n\nbankruptcy  court.  While the court granted Casas's motion to\n\nlift  the stay,  it  did so  on  grounds other  than  Casas's\n\nrepresentation  that Caguas and Oficentro were indispensable.\n\nMita  itself does  not  allege  that  it  relied  on  or  was\n\nprejudiced by the statement in any way.  There is the further\n\nfact that Mita  has played as \"fast  and loose\" as  has Casas\n\nwith the issue of  subject matter jurisdiction.  It  was Mita\n\n   the party now seeking remand to the Commonwealth courts   \n\nthat removed the  case here.   After  the fictitious  parties\n\nwere identified, it made no effort to remand.  Only after the\n\ndistrict court ruled against it  did Mita decide that federal\n\njurisdiction  was a mistake.   We conclude that  Casas is not\n\nestopped from taking the position it adopts now.  See Milgard\r                                                                         \n\nTempering, Inc.  v.

It  submits  that, because  the\n\npermanent  injunction  compels  it  to  resume  an  exclusive\n\ndistribution relationship with Casas  in the Greater San Juan\n\narea,   Caguas's  and   Oficentro's  contractual   rights  to\n\ndistribute  Mita  products  in  that  area   are  necessarily\n\ncanceled.   Moreover, Mita points out that Casas is seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment decreeing Mita's distribution agreements\n\nwith  Caguas  and  Oficentro  null and  void.    Under  these\n\ncircumstances, says  Mita, this action cannot  \"in equity and\n\ngood conscience\" proceed without  Caguas and Oficentro, which\n\nare entitled to protect their contractual interests.   We are\n\nnot persuaded.  A leading commentator writes:\n\n          When  a  person is  not  a  party to  the\n          contract  in litigation and has no rights\n          or obligations under that  contract, even\n          though  he may have  obligated himself to\n          abide by the result of the pending action\n          by another contract that is not at issue,\n          he   will   not   be   regarded   as   an\n          indispensable   party   in   a  suit   to\n          determine obligations  under the disputed\n\n                    \r                                \n\n9.

It may  be that the\n\npresence  of  the   nondiverse  party  produced  a   tactical\n\nadvantage for  one party or another.\"   Id. at 838.   In this\r                                                       \n\ncontext, Mita  argues that Casas gained  a tactical advantage\n\nby  Caguas's and  Oficentro's  presence in  the case  because\n\nCasas was able to obtain financial and business records under\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 33(a) and 34(a), which apply\n\nexpressly  to parties.  We do not agree, however, with Mita's\n\nsuggestion that these records  would have been beyond Casas's\n\nreach  had  Caguas  and  Oficentro  not  been  designated  as\n\nparties.  Under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 34(c), \"A person not a party\n\nto  the  action may  be  compelled to  produce  documents and\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\nthings  or to  submit to  an inspection  as provided  in Rule\n\n45.\"10\n\n          Thus, neither  Casas nor Mita  gained a significant\n\ntactical advantage by the presence of Caguas and Oficentro in\n\nthe lawsuit.  Nevertheless, we  are concerned that Caguas and\n\nOficentro could  themselves face prejudice if  dismissed from\n\nthis   suit.     Caguas   and   Oficentro,  while   initially\n\ncharacterized as John Doe  and Richard Roe, were contemplated\n\nas  parties  to  this litigation  from  the  start,  and have\n\nactively participated in  it since  June of  1992, when  they\n\nwere  substituted for  the  fictitious defendants.   Had  the\n\njurisdictional  defect been  called to  the  district court's\n\nattention at that point, the district court would have either\n\ndismissed  Caguas and  Oficentro  from  this action,  thereby\n\nrequiring Casas  to sue  them separately in  the commonwealth\n\ncourt,  or joined them to  this action, thereby remanding the\n\nentire  case to the  commonwealth court.   Either way, Caguas\n\nand Oficentro  would have had their liability determined in a\n\nsingle proceeding.   Instead,  because of the  jurisdictional\n\noversight, dismissal  of Caguas  and Oficentro at  this stage\n\ncould subject them to a new lawsuit before a new judge in the\n\nSuperior Court of Puerto Rico.  \n\n                    \r                                \n\n10.  Mita baldly  asserts that  Casas could not  have secured\nunder Rule 45 the documents and information it obtained under\nRules  33 and 34.   Mita fails, however,  to explain why this\nwould be so. \n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\n          In  Newman-Green, there  was a  similar difficulty.\r                                      \n\nThe problem there was  remedied by terminating the litigation\n\nagainst the dismissed defendant with  prejudice.  490 U.S. at\n\n838.   A similar remedy may be  appropriate in this case.  We\n\nnote,  however, that  Newman-Green presents  a  stronger case\r                                              \n\nthan  this  one  for  dismissing the  nondiverse  party  with\n\nprejudice,  since  the  nondiverse  party in  that  case  had\n\nalready  had its  claim  adjudicated by  the district  court.\n\nHere, by  contrast, Caguas  and Oficentro  have  not yet  had\n\ntheir claims adjudicated by  the district court.   Since this\n\ncase is closer than  the case in Newman-Green and  since this\r                                                         \n\nissue  has not been argued by  either party, we think it best\n\nto allow it to be decided initially by the district court, on\n\nremand, where the parties will have an opportunity to present\n\ntheir arguments.   \n\n          Accordingly, we dismiss  Caguas and Oficentro  from\n\nthis action to preserve  jurisdiction but direct the district\n\ncourt, on remand, to  determine whether the injury to  Caguas\n\nand Oficentro  from being  dismissed from this  proceeding is\n\nsuch  that  their dismissal  should  be  ordered  to be  with\n\nprejudice to any further suit by Casas.  Caguas and Oficentro\n\nhaving  been  dismissed, complete  diversity is  restored per\n\nNewman-Green, and we retain subject matter  jurisdiction over\r                        \n\nthe claims between Casas and Mita.\n\n                             IV.\n\n                             -25-\r\r\n\n          Having  disposed of  the jurisdictional  issues, we\n\ncome to the merits of Mita's appeal.  This appeal, of course,\n\nis interlocutory, see note 6,  supra, being taken solely from\r                                                \n\nthe  granting  of  the  injunction  against  Mita.    But the\n\ninjunction  can  stand only  if  the  court properly  awarded\n\nsummary judgment.  We accordingly confront the merits of that\n\nruling.\n\n          On summary judgment, we review the district court's\n\ndecision de novo.   Velez-Gomez  v.

A  court of appeals will\n\nuphold summary  judgment only  if the record,  viewed in  the\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmovant, reveals that there are\n\nno genuine issues  of material  fact and that  the movant  is\n\nentitled to  judgment as a matter  of law.  Celotex  Corp. v.\r                                                                      \n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324-25, 106  S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d\r                   \n\n265 (1986).\n\n          Mita's primary  argument is that  genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact  preclude the  granting of summary  judgment to\n\nCasas on its Law  75 claims.  Specifically, Mita  argues that\n\ngenuine issues  exist as  to: (1) whether  Mita impaired  its\n\ncontract  with Casas and (2) whether Mita had \"just cause\" to\n\ndo so.   To understand these arguments, we will  need to step\n\nback and take a look at the applicable law.\n\n          Law  75  protects  Puerto Rico-based  dealers  from\n\nsummary cancellation of  their dealership contracts  by their\n\n                             -26-\r\r\n\nprincipal  suppliers  after the  dealers  have  established a\n\nfavorable  market  for the  principal's  goods.

The stated  purpose of  the law is  to protect\n\nlocal  dealers from  abusive practices  by suppliers  who are\n\nfinancially stronger than they  are.  See Medina &amp;  Medina v.\r                                                                      \n\nCountry  Pride  Foods, Ltd.,  88  J.T.S.  6162, 6168  (1988),\r                                       \n\ntranslated in, 858  F.2d 817,  820 (1st Cir.  1988).   Toward\r                         \n\nthat end, Law 75 prohibits suppliers  from taking any actions\n\nthat  would impair  such  contracts, unless  they have  \"just\n\ncause\" for doing so:\n\n          Notwithstanding   the   existence  in   a\n          dealer's contract of  a clause  reserving\n          to  the parties  the unilateral  right to\n          terminate  the existing  relationship, no\n          principal  or  grantor  may  directly  or\n          indirectly perform any act detrimental to\n          the established relationship or refuse to\n          renew   said   contract  on   its  normal\n          expiration, except for just cause.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,   978a.  \n\n          Law  75 establishes  a  rebuttable  presumption  of\n\nimpairment  when  a  supplier   appoints  another  dealer  in\n\nviolation  of its  exclusive  dealership  agreement with  its\n\noriginal dealer:\n\n          For the  purposes of  this Act  . .  . it\n          shall  be presumed,  but for  evidence to\n          the contrary, that a principal or grantor\n          has impaired the existing  relationship .\n          .  .  when   the  principal  or   grantor\n          establishes  a distribution  relationship\n\n                             -27-\r\r\n\n          with one or  more additional dealers  for\n          the area  of Puerto Rico, or  any part of\n          said  area in conflict  with the contract\n          existing between the parties.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit.  10,   278a-1(b)(2).  The  district court\n\nadopted the magistrate's  determination that this presumption\n\napplied  to  Mita.   Mita  disputes this  holding  on appeal.\n\nHowever, Mita did not  dispute impairment before the district\n\ncourt and, therefore,  waived its right to  make the argument\n\non  appeal.   Even without  the presumption,  moreover, Casas\n\npresented  ample  evidence  of impairment  of  the  exclusive\n\ndealership   through  Mita's   appointment   of  Caguas   and\n\nOficentro,  evidence which Mita did  not dispute.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nDraft-Line Corp. v.

Supp.  328,  331 (D.P.R.  1987).\r                              \n\nAccordingly,  the only issue  on appeal is  whether there was\n\n\"just cause\" for the impairment.\n\n          Law 75's \"just cause\" limitation applies even where\n\na contract includes a  clause providing for termination under\n\nspecified  circumstances.    Because  many  such  termination\n\nclauses were tied to distribution quotas or goals, amendments\n\nto Law 75  in 1988 clarified what  \"just cause\" meant  in the\n\ncontext of contracts that contain such clauses:\n\n          The  violation  or nonperformance  by the\n          dealer of  any provision included  in the\n          dealer's contract fixing rules of conduct\n          or distribution quotas  or goals  because\n          it does not  adjust to  the realities  of\n\n                             -28-\r\r\n\n          the Puerto Rican  market at  the time  of\n          the  violation  or nonperformance  by the\n          dealer  shall not  be deemed  just cause.\n          The   burden   of  proof   to   show  the\n          reasonableness of the  rule of conduct or\n          of the quota or  goal fixed shall rest on\n          the principal or grantor.\n\nP.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 10,   278a-1(c)(1988).  Thus  failure to\n\nmeet a distribution quota will only constitute just cause for\n\nimpairment  under Law  75  if  that  quota  is  shown  to  be\n\n\"reasonable\"  given the state  of the Puerto  Rican market at\n\nthe  time of the alleged  violation.  See  Newell Puerto Rico\r                                                                         \n\nLtd. v. Rubbermaid, Inc., 20 F.3d 15, 22-23 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                    \n\n          The contract between  Mita and Casas  granted Casas\n\nan exclusive dealership in the greater San Juan area, so long\n\nas Casas met  85% of  a specific performance  quota.11   Mita\n\nterminated the  exclusive dealership when, it  alleges, Casas\n\nfailed to meet 85% of the quota.  Under Law 75, however, Mita\n\ncould  not impair its contract without just cause.  Under the\n\nabove  provisions  of  Law  75,  Mita  had  \"just  cause\"  to\n\nterminate  the exclusivity  provision only  if the  quota was\n\nadjusted to the realities  of the Puerto Rican market  at the\n\ntime of Casas's failure to meet the quota.   Moreover, Law 75\n\n                    \r                                \n\n11.  The  quota called for Casas  to sell 300  copiers and to\ngenerate $450,000  in sales of such copiers  during the first\n13  months of the contract,  between April 1,  1989 and April\n30, 1990.  Thus, to preserve the exclusivity provision, Casas\nhad to  sell 255 copiers (85%  of 300).  If  Casas fell below\n255 copiers, it could  still retain a nonexclusive dealership\nunless  its sales were 50%  below quota, in  which event Mita\ncould terminate any relationship whatsoever. \n\n                             -29-\r\r\n\nplaces  on  Mita's  shoulders   the  burden  of  proving  the\n\nreasonableness  of the  quota.   Thus,  once Casas  moved for\n\nsummary judgment  and alleged an absence  of evidence showing\n\nthat the quota provision was reasonable, Mita was required to\n\ncome forth  with such  evidence in  order to  survive summary\n\njudgment.   Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325 (Where the nonmovant has\r                               \n\nthe burden of proof, the movant need do no more than aver \"an\n\nabsence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case\".);\n\nPagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                           \n\n          Mita contends that it submitted evidence sufficient\n\nto  raise  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  as  to  the\n\nreasonableness of  the quota.   It points to  letters between\n\nits  counsel  and  Casas's  counsel,  and  a  declaration  by\n\nMasaharu Ishidoya,  vice  president of  Mita's  international\n\ndivision,   describing   the   negotiation  of   the   quota.\n\nIshidoya's  declaration indicated that Casas itself requested\n\nthat the  exclusivity provision be conditioned  upon a yearly\n\nperformance goal.  At his deposition, Ishidoya indicated that\n\nthe  300  copier  quota  in  the contract  was  a  negotiated\n\nreduction from a quota of 500 copiers first proposed by Mita.\n\nThe 1989  contract contained express language  in which Casas\n\n\"acknowledges  that the  annual quotas  . .  . adjust  to the\n\nrealities  of the market\" in Puerto Rico.  Ishidoya states in\n\nhis declaration  that he relied  upon Casas's representations\n\nto that effect.  Mita also submitted a copy of  the letter it\n\n                             -30-\r\r\n\nsent  to  Casas, terminating  the  exclusive  dealership with\n\nCasas.   In that letter,  Mita stated it  was terminating the\n\nexclusivity  provision  in  the  contract  because  Casas had\n\nfailed  to  meet  the  quota  percentages  set  forth  in the\n\ncontract.\n\n          Mita  further submitted  the declaration  of Rafael\n\nMartinez  Margarida, the  Managing  Partner  and  Partner-in-\n\nCharge of Management Consulting Services at Price Waterhouse.\n\nMita  retained Martinez as an expert witness to testify as to\n\nthe   reasonableness  of   the  contract   quota.     In  his\n\ndeclaration, Martinez stated  that he examined  Puerto Rico's\n\nExternal  Trade Statistics  (\"PRETS\")  for  imports  of  copy\n\nmachines to Puerto  Rico for  the period of  1985-1990.   The\n\ndeclaration included the following table:\n\nYEAR    QTY.

Martinez also noted that the quota in\n\nthe contract was a projection  based on Casas's actual  sales\n\nfigures in 1985 (279  units), 1986 (153 units) and  1987 (230\n\nunits).  Finally, Martinez noted that  Casas's sales for 1989\n\n(80  units) and  1990  (110  units) decreased  significantly,\n\nwhile  the overall  number of  imports increased  during that\n\n                             -31-\r\r\n\nsame  period.     Martinez  concluded  that   the  quota  was\n\nreasonable given the historical  trend, that Casas \"failed to\n\ncapitalize  on  the  opportunities  available  in  a  growing\n\nmarket,\"  and that its failure  to meet the  quota \"cannot be\n\nattributable to the conditions of  the Puerto Rico market for\n\nphotocopying machines.\"\n\n          Casas points to various alleged flaws in Martinez's\n\nmethodology,  and argues  that these  flaws require  that his\n\ndeclaration  be   completely  excluded  as   unprobative  and\n\nincompetent.  Casas  argues that, in  failing to deduct  from\n\nthe import figures the number of copiers exported from Puerto\n\nRico, Martinez based his conclusions on an inaccurate picture\n\nof  the internal copier market.  Casas also argues that these\n\nsame  import figures  include  imports of  all categories  of\n\ncopiers,  not just the categories of  copiers that Casas sold\n\nas part of  its exclusive dealership  agreement, and thus  do\n\nnot accurately reflect the precise market in  which Casas was\n\noperating.12   Casas  also  argues that  the quota,  although\n\nbased  on historical  sales  figures,  unreasonably  required\n\n                    \r                                \n\n12.  Casas also  argues that the yearly  data was irrelevant,\nsince Mita must provide evidence about the market on or about\nMay  1990, when the contract was terminated.  This is plainly\nwrong.  Law 75  requires Mita to prove the  reasonableness of\nthe  quota \"at the time of the violation or nonperformance by\nthe  dealer.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit.  10,   278a-1(c).  Casas's\nalleged nonperformance  occurred  during the  period  between\nApril 1989 and May 1990.  Under the plain terms of Law 75, it\nis the condition  of the  market during that  period that  is\nrelevant,  not the  condition of  the  market at  the precise\npoint of the contract's impairment by the supplier.\n\n                             -32-\r\r\n\nCasas  to double  its market  share in  13 months.   Finally,\n\nCasas  argues  that  Martinez  failed  to   consider  various\n\nrelevant  factors in  his analysis,  including the  effect of\n\nincreased  intrabrand competition,  changes in the  number of\n\ndealers  in the market, the effect of Hurricane Hugo, and the\n\nimpact of  the local economic recession.   Accordingly, Casas\n\nargues, Martinez's  declaration must be excluded,  and Mita's\n\nremaining evidence  is insufficient to raise  a genuine issue\n\nof fact.\n\n          The district  court found  that Mita had  failed to\n\npresent  evidence sufficient to  raise a genuine  issue as to\n\nthe reasonableness of the quota.  The court stated:\n\n             The  magistrate  found, and  we agree,\n          that the quota provision was unreasonable\n          at the time of Casas' nonperformance.  In\n          support of its  claim that the  quota was\n          reasonable,  Mita presented  an unsworn13\n          declaration by Rafael Martinez Margarida,\n          a  certified public accountant (CPA).  In\n          this  declaration  the CPA  asserted that\n          his  examination  of   the  Puerto   Rico\n          External Trade's [sic] Statistics (PRETS)\n          reflected    a    growing   market    for\n          photocopying  machine  imports  from  the\n          period of 1985 to 1990, inclusive.  Thus,\n          he concluded, Casas'  failure to meet the\n          quota  could not be  attributed to market\n          conditions.\n             As the magistrate found,  Casas proved\n          that   Mita's   argument  was   based  on\n          erroneous statistics.  Among  the factors\n          cited  by the  magistrate  which we  find\n          most convincing, the CPA's  report failed\n          to take into account essential aspects of\n\n                    \r                                \n\n13.  The  unsworn   declaration  was  made   under  pain  and\npenalties of perjury.  28 U.S.C.   1746.\n\n                             -33-\r\r\n\n          the  Puerto  Rican  market  such  as  the\n          effects   of   Hurricane  Hugo   and  the\n          recession  on  the  economy.    The CPA's\n          report also failed  to take into  account\n          the  effect  of  intrabrand   rivalry  on\n          Casas's market share, a  rivalry fostered\n          by Mita's impairment of  Casas' exclusive\n          distributorship.\n             Additionally,  Mita's  data as  to the\n          market  for  copying  machines in  Puerto\n          Rico   erroneously   included  types   of\n          copying apparatus that were  not machines\n          manufactured by Mita  and sold to  Casas.\n          Thus,  Mita's  evidence  exaggerated  the\n          size of the market by including within it\n          devices such as thermocopying mechanisms,\n          which  were  not among  those apparatuses\n          made  and  sold  to Casas  by  Mita,  and\n          minimized market conditions by failing to\n          include   negative    factors   such   as\n          Hurricane   Hugo,   the  recession,   the\n          intrabrand rivalry etc.   Clearly, Mita's\n          evidence  fails  to  create a  sufficient\n          question to prevent the entry  of summary\n          judgment in Casas'  favor since Mita  has\n          the  burden of  proving that  the quota's\n          [sic]  were  reasonable  at  the  time of\n          Casas'  nonperformance,  given the  legal\n          presumption    that    they   were    not\n          unreasonable.\n             Thus,   it  was   \"unreliable,  lacked\n          probative value, and does  not constitute\n          competent evidence.\" [Citing Magistrate's\n          Report.]     Mita  claims  now  that  its\n          failure to submit more probative evidence\n          was due to  its lack of time  in which to\n          gather  and  present  it.

Casas\r                                                  \n\nargues  that the district  court properly excluded Martinez's\n\ndeclaration as based on flawed data and, faced with a lack of\n\nevidence  as to  the  reasonableness of  the quota,  properly\n\nentered summary judgment in its favor.  \n\nA.   Martinez's Declaration was not Excludable\r                                                          \n\n          It is not  clear that the  district court meant  to\n\ntreat Martinez's declaration as excludable under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(e).  The court nowhere articulated such  a ruling.  But\n\nif  we assume the court  meant to exclude  the declaration as\n\nincompetent for  summary judgment purposes, we  think it went\n\ntoo far.   We  may accept  that Martinez's  opinion, standing\n\nalone,  was  worth little  more  than the  inferences  a fact\n\nfinder might reasonably draw from  the factual data stated in\n\nhis  declaration.   Martinez was  not said  to have  had some\n\nspecial familiarity  with, or  expertise in, the  Puerto Rico\n\ncopier market, apart from the data he presented and sought to\n\ninterpret.    However, that  data,  including  the PRETS  and\n\nCasas's past sales figures, was admissible and, examined in a\n\nlight  most favorable  to Mita,  tends to  support Martinez's\n\nconclusion  that the quota was  reasonable.  We  see no basis\n\nunder  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(e)  for  excluding  the  entire\n\ndeclaration altogether. \n\n          Under  Rule 56(e),  an  affidavit must  meet  three\n\nrequirements.  It:\n\n                             -36-\r\r\n\n          [1]  shall be made on personal knowledge,\n          [2] shall set forth  such facts as  would\n          be admissible in evidence, and  [3] shall\n          show  affirmatively  that the  affiant is\n          competent  to  testify  to   the  matters\n          stated therein.\n\nFed. R.  Civ. P. 56(e).   Unless a  party moves to  strike an\n\naffidavit under Rule 56(e),  any objections are deemed waived\n\nand a court may consider the affidavit.  See  Davis v.

Furthermore, a court will disregard only\n\nthose  portions of  an  affidavit that  are inadmissible  and\n\nconsider the rest of  it.  See Lee  v.

This  is\n\nnothing more  than the procedure  which would be  followed at\n\ntrial.\"); Wright,   2738 at 509.\n\n          In moving  below to strike  the Martinez deposition\n\nunder Rule 56(e), Casas  made much the same arguments  it now\n\nmakes on appeal.  Casas did not  argue under the first clause\r                                           \n\nin  Rule  56(e)  that   Martinez  lacked  personal  knowledge\r                                                                         \n\nsufficient to testify as to the PRETS and sales figures.  Nor\n\ndid  Casas argue  under the  third clause  that Martinez  was\n\n                             -37-\r\r\n\nincompetent to provide  his expert  interpretation of  these.\r                       \n\nRather,  Casas argued, under the second clause of Rule 56(e),\n\nthat  the  facts  contained   in  the  declaration  were  not\n\nadmissible in evidence because,  in essence, they were simply\n\nnot  sufficiently   material  to,   and  probative  of,   the\n\nreasonableness of the quota.\n\n          The district court characterized the declaration as\n\ncontaining \"erroneous  statistics.\"   Casas, 847 F.  Supp. at\r                                                       \n\n988.    But neither  Casas nor  the  court asserted  that the\n\nfigures in the declaration were not accurate reproductions of\n\nPuerto Rico's External Trade Statistics, nor did they dispute\n\nthe  correctness   of  the   other  data  mentioned   in  the\n\ndeclaration.   The court's reason for  calling the statistics\n\n\"erroneous\" seems not  to have been their  inaccuracy as such\n\nbut  rather  its  belief  that  they  did  not constitute  an\n\naccurate  measure  of the  Puerto  Rico copier  market.   The\n\ndistrict  court  also  criticized  the  alleged  failure   of\n\nMartinez's declaration to account for the impact of Hurricane\n\nHugo,  the effect of the  local recession, and  the impact of\n\nintrabrand rivalry, matters raised in Casas's materials.  \n\n          But the increase in copier imports between 1989 and\n\n1990, as reflected in  the PRETS, implicitly rebutted Casas's\n\nevidence that the hurricane and the local recession had had a\n\nmaterially adverse effect on  the Puerto Rican copier market.\n\nIn  finding that  the  declaration failed  to consider  these\n\n                             -38-\r\r\n\n\"essential  aspects\"  of  the  market,   the  district  court\n\noverlooked the  relevant inference  that could be  drawn from\n\nthe  rise in  copier imports  shown in  the PRETS  figures.15\n\nSee Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158, 90 S. Ct.\r                                           \n\n1598,  26 L.  Ed  2d 142  (1970);  Aponte-Santiago v.  Lopez-\r                                                                         \n\nRivera, 957 F.2d 40, 41 (1st Cir. 1992) (the court at summary\r                  \n\njudgment \"must  view the evidence and  all factual inferences\n\ntherefrom  in  the light  most  favorable  to the  non-moving\n\nparty\").  \n\n          Casas's argument that the  PRETS and other data did\n\nnot  account for the impact of intrabrand competition is more\n\ntroubling.   See infra.  While the PRETS figures suggest that\r                                  \n\nthe market grew in spite of the hurricane and recession, they\n\nindicate  nothing  directly  about  the  possible  impact  of\n\nincreased intrabrand  competition.  However, it  is one thing\n\nto  note this silence of the evidence, another to exclude the\n\nPRETS  figures because of it.   Evidence may  be relevant and\n\nadmissible even  though, standing alone, it  fails to address\n\n                    \r                                \n\n15.

In Quinones,\r                                                                        \nthe  expert testimony with respect to damages was based on an\nassumption that was clearly unsupported by the record, namely\nthat  the plaintiff was permanently disabled.  979 F.2d at 6.\nSimilarly, in  Merit Motors,  the expert testimony  failed to\r                                       \naccount for significant factors that were clearly relevant to\nthe issue at hand.   569 F.2d at 673.   By contrast, in  this\ncase, it remains  open to debate whether  Hurricane Hugo, the\nrecession,  or intrabrand  competition had  an effect  on the\nPuerto Rico market,  and what that  effect was, if any.   The\nimpact  of  these  factors  is  precisely  the  issue  to  be\nresolved.\n\n                             -39-\r\r\n\nevery issue raised in a case.  As noted below, Mita presented\n\nother evidence  that arguably bolsters its  position that the\n\nquota  was   reasonable.  Given  the   unlikelihood  of  ever\n\nunearthing  irrefutable statistical evidence, we do not think\n\nthe PRETS  and other statistics, and accompanying inferences,\n\nwere  so  weak  that  they  should  be  rejected as  material\n\nevidence in this case.  \n\n          The  district  court found  that the  PRETS figures\n\nwere also \"erroneous\" because they included  other categories\n\nof  copying machines that were not the types of machines sold\n\nby Casas.  Casas, 847 F. Supp.  at 988.  Casas pointed to the\r                            \n\nfact  that the  1990 PRETS  figure included  imports of  five\n\ncategories of copiers, while Casas sold copiers in only three\n\nof  these categories.    This \"exaggerated  the  size of  the\n\nmarket.\"  The absolute  size of the market was  not, however,\n\nthe issue.   Rather, the issue was  the trend in  the market,\n\ni.e. whether the market was increasing or decreasing, whether\n\nCasas's sales were consistent with the trend, and whether the\n\nquota was  consistent with  Casas's historical market  share.\n\nMartinez explained in his deposition that it was necessary to\n\ninclude the  additional categories in the  1990 PRETS figures\n\nin  order to  obtain comparable yearly  data, since  prior to\n\nthat year the data for the copier market had  not been broken\n\nup  into the  five  subcategories.   The  inclusion of  these\n\ncategories did  not necessarily make his  testimony about the\n\n                             -40-\r\r\n\ntrend in the market any less probative.  Casas did not attack\n\nthe  comparability  of  the  figures and  failed  to  present\n\nevidence suggesting  that excluding the  categories, if  this\n\nhad indeed been possible, would have resulted in a  different\n\ntrend.  \n\n          We  conclude  that the  reasons  set  forth by  the\n\ndistrict  court were  insufficient  bases  for rejecting  the\n\nMartinez declaration altogether,  assuming this was what  the\n\ncourt  intended to  do.   Nor do  we find  Casas's additional\n\narguments  sufficient  for  its  outright  exclusion.   Casas\n\ncomplains: that Martinez failed to deduct export figures from\n\nthe  import figures in order to  obtain a true measure of the\n\ninternal copier market; that  Martinez failed to consider the\n\nfact that  the quota, according  to Casas, required  Casas to\n\ndouble its market share within thirteen months; that Martinez\n\nfailed to consider  the fact  that during the  period of  the\n\ncontract, Casas had a  smaller region of exclusive dealership\n\nthan before.  \n\n          While  these additional  arguments are  not without\n\nforce, a party may not exclude, on summary judgment, relevant\n\nand  otherwise  admissible  factual evidence  solely  on  the\n\nground  that  the  evidence  leaves a  number  of  unanswered\n\nquestions or  that it  appears somewhat less  persuasive than\n\nthe  movant's evidence  offered  in rebuttal.   If  there are\n\ngenuine issues  of fact,  the nonmovant  is entitled to  have\n\n                             -41-\r\r\n\nthese  resolved  in the  trial forum,  where the  fact finder\n\nhears live witnesses and can better assess all the facts.  \n\n          We conclude    if the district court intended to do\n\nso    that it  did not have sufficient grounds  for excluding\n\nMita's declaration under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\nB.   Sufficiency of Mita's Evidence to Raise Issue of Fact\r                                                                      \n\n          Having  found no  adequate  basis  to exclude  from\n\nconsideration  Martinez's  declaration,   we  next   consider\n\nwhether  that  declaration  and  Mita's  other evidence  were\n\nsufficient  to  raise  a genuine  issue  of  fact  as to  the\n\nreasonableness of  the  quota in  light  of the  Puerto  Rico\n\nmarket.16 \n\n          It  is  instructive  first to  review  the  summary\n\njudgment  standard.    \"By  its  very  terms,  this  standard\n\nprovides  that the  mere  existence of  some alleged  factual\n\ndispute  between the  parties  will not  defeat an  otherwise\n\nproperly  supported   motion   for  summary   judgment,   the\n\nrequirement  is that  there is  no genuine issue  of material\r                                                                         \n\nfact.\"  Anderson v.

Casas does not  address this issue  on appeal.   Casas's\nonly argument on appeal  is that the district court  properly\nexcluded the  Martinez declaration.   Although this  could be\ninterpreted  as  a  concession  that  summary   judgment  was\nimproper  if  the  Martinez declaration  was  admissible,  we\nnevertheless  proceed to  address  the key  summary  judgment\nissue.\n\n                             -42-\r\r\n\nresolve the issue in the non-movant's favor.

If the  facts permit\r                               \n\nmore  than one  reasonable  inference, the  court on  summary\n\njudgmentmay notadopttheinferenceleastfavorabletothenonmovant.\n\n          Viewing  Mita's  evidence  in  its  most  favorable\n\nlight, we think that, although the  question is close, Mita's\n\nevidence   and  the   reasonable  inferences   therefrom  are\n\nsufficient to raise a genuine  issue as to the reasonableness\n\nof  the quota.  First,  the contract executed  by the parties\n\ncontains a  clause in which  Casas expressly agreed  that the\n\nquota  was reasonable in light of the realities of the Puerto\n\nRico  market.   We  do not  suggest that  such  a clause  was\n\n                             -43-\r\r\n\nbinding, since public policy  would presumably not permit the\r                   \n\nprovisions  of Law 75 to  be contracted away.17   However, we\n\nthink  Casas's express  agreement  in the  contract that  the\n\nquota  was  reasonable  is  admissible  evidence  tending  to\n\nestablish the reasonableness  of the quota at  the time Casas\n\nsigned  the  contract.    Bolstering the  weight  of  Casas's\n\nconcession  were  the  letters   from  Mita's  attorneys  and\n\nIshidoya's testimony showing  that Casas had been  successful\n\nin renegotiating  the quota downward from 500 to 300 copiers.\n\nIts ability  to do  so suggests  a  degree of  parity in  the\n\nparties' bargaining  positions, making  it  more likely  that\n\nCasas  really believed the quota to be reasonable at the time\n\nit signed the contract.18\n\n          In   addition,  inferences   from  the   PRETS  and\n\nhistorical sales figures  contained in Martinez's declaration\n\n                    \r                                \n\n17.  Cf.  P.R.  Laws  Ann.  tit.  30,     3372  (1991)  (\"The\r                    \ncontracting parties may make  the agreement and establish the\nclauses  and  conditions  which   they  may  deem  advisable,\nprovided they are  not in contravention  of laws, morals,  or\npublic order.\"); In re Pagan Ayala, 117 D.P.R. 180, 187 &amp; n.4\r                                              \n(1986), Translated  in, 17  Official Translations 216,  223 &amp;\r                                  \nn.4 (1986) (suggesting that contracts  exempting attorneys ex\nante from malpractice suits are void).\n\n18.  Casas argues that any  evidence of reasonableness of the\nquota at a  time prior  to the period  of nonperformance  was\nirrelevant here.  However, viewed in the light most favorable\nto Mita, we think that evidence of reasonableness immediately\nprior to the  term of  the contract was  material.   Combined\nwith Martinez's declaration indicating  that the Puerto  Rico\ncopier market did not subsequently decrease, but rather grew,\nthis evidence  is probative of the  continuing reasonableness\nof  the quota between April  1989 and May  1990, the relevant\nperiod.  See note 12, supra.\r                                       \n\n                             -44-\r\r\n\nsuggest that if  the quota was  reasonable when the  contract\n\nwas signed, it remained  so during the term of  the contract.\n\nThe  contract required Casas to sell 255 copiers (85% of 300)\n\nduring  a 13-month  period in order  to retain  its exclusive\n\ndealership.  This  figure was  not grossly out  of line  with\n\nCasas's historical 12-month sales  figures: (297 in 1985, 153\n\nin 1986, and  230 in 1987).  The  PRETS figures indicate that\n\nthe market for copiers actually increased during  the term of\n\nthe contract (from  7,056 in 1989 to 8,983 in  1990).  If the\n\nquota  was based roughly on past sales, and if the market for\n\ncopiers did  not suffer  any decrease, it  could be  inferred\n\nfrom  this evidence that the quota was reasonable in light of\n\nthe Puerto Rico market.  \n\n          Casas,  to  be  sure,  presented   much  persuasive\n\nevidence in opposition.  Summary judgment, however, is  not a\n\nsubstitute  for trial.  We  do not think  Casas's evidence so\n\nundermined Mita's case that  Mita can be said to  have failed\n\nto   raise   a  genuine   issue   of   fact  concerning   the\n\nreasonableness of the quota.  At most, it indicated that many\n\nissues  of  fact remained  to be  resolved  at trial.   Casas\n\npresented  a declaration  by its  president, stating  that he\n\nthought the quota unreasonable and that Mita had imposed  the\n\nquota unilaterally by threatening to cancel their preexisting\n\ndistribution relationship.   Mita's vice  president, however,\n\nasserted that  he \"relied on Casas'  representations that the\n\n                             -45-\r\r\n\nperformance goal and the related  percentages were reasonable\n\nfor the relevant  market.\"  Mita's evidence tends  to suggest\n\nthat  the  quota was  arrived  at  through bargaining,  Casas\n\nhaving  persuaded Mita  to lower  the quota  from 500  to 300\n\ncopiers.   The Casas  declaration also states  that Hurricane\n\nHugo  and the  local recession  had an  effect on  the copier\n\nmarket.  As  we have previously  said, however, Mita's  PRETS\n\nfigures minimized  these effects  by showing that  the copier\n\nmarket increased during the term of the contract.  \n\n          Casas's   strongest   argument   is   that   Mita's\n\nstatistical evidence of market growth and of past sales fails\n\nto account  for the fact  that, prior to 1988,  Casas was the\n\nonly distributor  of Mita  products  for all  of Puerto  Rico\n\n(even  though  its  contract  then  was  nonexclusive).    By\n\ncontrast,  during the term of the  contract, Casas argues, it\n\nfaced stiff intrabrand competition.  Its exclusive dealership\n\ncovered only a portion  of Puerto Rico, the greater  San Juan\n\narea.   While it could  also sell Mita  products elsewhere in\n\nPuerto Rico on a nonexclusive basis, it now faced competition\n\nfrom two other authorized  Mita dealers outside the exclusive\n\nSan Juan area as  well as from alleged unauthorized  sales of\n\nMita's copiers by Caguas and Oficentro.  According to  Casas,\n\nits  competitors sold  327 Mita  copiers during  the 13-month\n\nperiod  of the contract.  Casas argues that Mita's past sales\n\nfigures simply  do not  address the  issue of this  increased\n\n                             -46-\r\r\n\nintrabrand  competition, hence  they  say nothing  as to  the\n\nquota's reasonableness during the relevant period.\n\n          But  we   do  not  think  that   this  argument  so\n\nundermines Mita's case as  to eliminate any contested factual\n\nissue.  It is unclear how to assess the effects of intrabrand\n\ncompetition in  calculating the reasonableness of  the quota.\n\nThe fact that  other nonexclusive dealers  were able to  sell\n\n327  Mita copiers during  the relevant period  outside of San\n\nJuan is a double-edged sword.  While, to be sure, these sales\n\nsuggest that Casas faced stern competition, it also indicates\n\nthe  existence of a strong  demand for Mita  copiers on which\n\nCasas  was presumably free to capitalize to the extent it was\n\ncapable.    It  is  unclear,  moreover,  in  measuring  quota\n\nreasonableness,  how   intrabrand   competition  is   to   be\n\ndistinguished from the  effects of  competition from  copiers\n\nmade by  other  manufacturers.   Such interbrand  competition\n\nwould have existed earlier as well as  in 1989-90.  While the\n\nnew  factor of  intrabrand competition doubtless  weakens the\n\npredictive value  of Casas's  earlier sales figures,  it does\n\nnot totally vitiate their  relevance to quota reasonableness.\n\nCasas knew when  it signed the contract  that its exclusivity\n\nwould  be limited to the  San Juan area,  and presumably also\n\nknew of the  intrabrand competition it faced  elsewhere.  The\n\nevidence permits  an inference that in  Casas's then judgment\n\nthe quota was  reasonable despite the  anticipated interbrand\n\n                             -47-\r\r\n\nand intrabrand competition.  Thereafter, the overall trend in\n\ncopier imports was up suggesting    at least, as one possible\n\ninterpretation of  the data    that  Casas's poor performance\n\nwas  due not to lack of opportunity  but to some fault of its\n\nown.\n\n          We conclude that Mita presented evidence sufficient\n\nto  raise a  genuine issue  as to  the reasonableness  of the\n\nquota.       Particularly    where   the    standard    here,\n\n\"reasonableness,\" is  so  amorphous, and  \"hard\" evidence  to\n\nprove \"reasonableness\" so obviously  difficult to come by and\n\nsubject  to multiple  interpretations, we are  disinclined to\n\ndeny Mita its day  in court by raising the  threshold barrier\n\nof proof too high.  See Rogen, 361 F.2d at 265-66 (suggesting\r                                         \n\nthat delicate issues of fact  \"may well indicate a preference\n\nfor the antennae of the factfinder over the cruder instrument\n\nof summary judgment\");  Newell, 20 F.3d  at 23 (deferring  to\r                                          \n\nthe jury's judgment that supplier  failed to meet its  burden\n\nof proving that  a quota was \"reasonable\" under  Law 75).  To\n\nthe extent that we  have doubts about the  appropriateness of\n\nsummary judgment, we  are required to resolve them  in Mita's\n\nfavor.\n\n          Throughout its brief, Casas repeatedly asserts that\n\nMita has failed  to satisfy  its burden of  proving that  the\n\nquota  is reasonable.    This misapprehends  the burden  Mita\n\nfaces at summary  judgment.   Mita is not  required to  prove\n\n                             -48-\r\r\n\nthat the quota was  reasonable.  Rather it was  only required\n\nto  present evidence sufficient  to raise a  genuine issue of\n\nfact  as to reasonableness.   The burden is  one of producing\n\nenough evidence  to show that it is  entitled to a trial, not\n\nthat it will necessarily  be successful at trial.   See First\r                                                                         \n\nNat'l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv.

Ed. 2d 569 (1966) (\"It is true that\n\nthe  issue  of material  fact required  by  Rule 56(c)  to be\n\npresent  to  entitle  a party  to  proceed  to  trial is  not\n\nrequired to be  resolved conclusively in  favor of the  party\n\nasserting its existence; rather, all that is required is that\n\nsufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be\n\nshown  to require  a jury  or judge  to resolve  the parties'\n\ndiffering  versions of the truth at trial.\")  We believe Mita\n\nhas  satisfied  this  burden.    We  conclude  that Mita  has\n\npresented  evidence sufficient  to raise  a genuine  issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to the reasonableness of the quota given the\n\ncondition of  the Puerto Rican  copier market.

Without making too much  of this, we note that  Casas in\nits brief almost concedes that there exist disputed issues of\nfact.   After listing  the  evidence it  presented about  the\nunreasonableness of the quota, it states: \"Among others, this\nevidence raises material  questions of fact as  to the effect\nof Hurricane Hugo, the recession, the  intrabrand competition\nof  MITA  machines,  and   the  manipulation  of  statistical\ninformation by MITA's expert  in order to artificially create\na 'growing market'.\"  We agree.\n\n                             -49-\r\r\n\n                              V.\n\n          In accordance with this opinion, we  hereby dismiss\n\nCaguas  and  Oficentro  from  this suit  and  remand  to  the\n\ndistrict court  to determine whether the  dismissal of Caguas\n\nand Oficentro  should be with  or without prejudice.   Having\n\ndetermined that the district  court erred in granting Casas's\n\nmotion for  partial summary  judgment, we vacate  the court's\n\norder granting  Casas a  permanent injunction.

(\"Mita\")  appeals from  the  district  court's\n\norder  granting  summary  judgment  and  issuing  a permanent\n\ninjunction in favor of Casas Office Machines, Inc. (\"Casas\").\n\nThe  action began  when Casas  sued Mita  and two  fictitious\n\ndefendants,  John Doe and Richard Roe,  in the Superior Court\n\nof Puerto Rico,  San Juan Part.  Organized  under the laws of\n\nCalifornia  and with its  principal place of  business in New\n\nJersey, Mita removed the action to the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico.  After removal, Casas,\n\nby  an amendment  to its  complaint, replaced  the fictitious\n\ndefendants with  two named defendants, Caguas  Copy, Inc. and\n\nOficentro  J.P., Inc.,  which,  like Casas,  are Puerto  Rico\n\ncorporations.  Complete diversity  of citizenship between the\n\nparties was thus destroyed, although this fact was not called\n\nto  the district court's attention at the time.  The district\n\ncourt  proceeded to deny  Mita's motions  to dismiss  and for\n\nsummary  judgment,  and  it  allowed  Casas's  motion  for  a\n\npermanent injunction enjoining Mita from impairing a contract\n\nentered into with Casas.  Now, for the  first time on appeal,\n\nMita  points out  the  jurisdictional problem  caused by  the\n\naddition of the nondiverse  parties.  Mita asks us  to vacate\n\nthe judgment below and order the district court to remand the\n\naction  to  the Superior  Court of  Puerto  Rico.   Mita also\n\nattacks the district court's  decision on the merits, arguing\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthat  summary judgment  was  improper and  that the  district\n\ncourt erred in granting the permanent injunction.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Incorporated   in  Puerto  Rico,  Casas  sells  and\n\ndistributes   office  and  photocopying   equipment  in  that\n\nCommonwealth.  In 1983, Casas entered into an  agreement with\n\nMita,  a supplier  of office  and photographic  equipment, to\n\ndistribute Mita products in Puerto Rico.  As noted, Mita is a\n\nCalifornia  corporation with its  principal place of business\n\nin  New  Jersey.   Following  a period  of  strained business\n\nrelations, Casas and Mita executed a second agreement in 1989\n\n(the \"1989 Agreement\") granting  Casas the exclusive right to\n\ndistribute Mita's  products in  the \"Greater San  Juan\" area.\n\nParagraph  5 of  the 1989  Agreement, however,  provided that\n\nCasas's inability to meet or exceed 85% of a set  sales quota\n\nwould result in termination  of the exclusivity provisions of\n\nthe contract.  Asserting that Casas had failed to achieve the\n\n85% threshold, Mita terminated Casas's exclusive distribution\n\nrights      but  retained  Casas  as  a  distributor      and\n\ndesignated  two new  distributors in  the \"Greater  San Juan\"\n\narea.  \n\n          Casas responded on February 1, 1991, by suing Mita,\n\nJohn  Doe, and Richard Roe1  in the Superior  Court of Puerto\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Paragraph 3 of Casas's complaint said:\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nRico,  San  Juan  Part.   Casas  alleged  that  (1) Mita  had\n\ndeprived  Casas of its  exclusive distribution rights without\n\njust cause  in violation of P.R.  Laws Ann. tit. 10,     278-\n\n278d 91976) (referred to in the complaint and hereinafter  as\n\n\"Law 75\"), (2)  defendants had conspired to  deprive Casas of\n\nits  right to sell and distribute Mita products, (3) Mita had\n\nimpaired  Casas's exclusive  distribution agreement,  and (4)\n\ndefendants   had   intentionally   interfered  with   Casas's\n\ncontractual relationship with Mita.  Casas sought preliminary\n\nand permanent injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages.\n\n          Alleging the existence  of diversity  jurisdiction,\n\nMita removed the  action to the United  States District court\n\nfor  the  District   of  Puerto  Rico   on  March  6,   1991.\n\nThereafter, Casas amended its  complaint twice.

Count Five  alleged  that defendants  had  illicitly  and\ntortiously contracted  for the distribution of  Mita products\nin Puerto Rican  territories in which Mita had  granted Casas\nthe exclusive right to distribute its products. \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n(emphasis  added).  Four days  later, on May  18, 1992, Casas\n\nmoved the  district  court for  an  expedited review  of  its\n\nsecond  motion  to amend  its  complaint.   Such  review  was\n\nnecessary,  said  Casas,  because  Oficentro  was  under  the\n\nprotection  of the  United  States Bankruptcy  Court for  the\n\nDistrict  of  Puerto  Rico      which  had  ordered that  all\n\ncreditors file their  proof of  claims on or  before June  8,\n\n1992    and Casas could  not file a proof of claim  until its\n\nmotion to  amend was  granted.   The  district court  allowed\n\nCasas's second amendment in early June 1992.\n\n          In   the  meantime,  Mita  had  moved  for  summary\n\njudgment  on February 12, 1992.  It argued primarily that (1)\n\nMita did  not impair its contractual  relationship with Casas\n\nbecause  it merely enforced its rights under the terms of the\n\n1989  Agreement, (2) even if it were found that Mita impaired\n\nits contractual relationship with  Casas, Mita had just cause\n\nto do so,  and (3) Casas's suit  was barred by the  equitable\n\ndoctrine  of laches.  On March 16, 1992, Casas opposed Mita's\n\nmotion for  summary judgment, and brought  a cross-motion for\n\npartial interlocutory  summary judgment on its  Law 75 claims\n\n(Counts One and Three), renewing  its request for a permanent\n\ninjunction.3  Mita,  in turn,  filed, on April  13, 1992,  an\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  In  its  original  complaint,  Casas  had  requested  the\ndistrict court to \n\n          issue  a   permanent  injunction  against\n          Mita,  ordering it  [(1)]  to  cease  and\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nopposition to Casas's  cross-motion for  summary judgment  in\n\nwhich   it  maintained,  inter   alia,  that   (1)  permanent\r                                                 \n\ninjunctive  relief is  not available  under Law  75, and  (2)\n\nordering permanent  injunctive relief  in this case  would be\n\nunconstitutional.   Finally, in  a separate motion,  filed on\n\nJune 4, 1992, Mita sought to dismiss Casas's complaint on the\n\ngrounds that Casas had engaged in a fraud upon the court.\n\n          The United States magistrate judge  reviewed Mita's\n\nmotions  to dismiss  and  for summary  judgment,  as well  as\n\nCasas's cross-motion for summary  judgment.  In a  report and\n\nrecommendation  issued on  September 2, 1993,  the magistrate\n\njudge concluded that (1) Casas had not committed fraud on the\n\ncourt, (2) Casas  was not  barred by the  doctrine of  laches\n\nfrom pursuing its claims under Law  75, (3) Mita did not have\n\njust  cause  under  Law  75 to  terminate  Casas's  exclusive\n\ndistribution rights because it failed to demonstrate that the\n\nquota provision in the 1989  Agreement was reasonable at  the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n          desist  from  continuing  with  the  acts\n          which constitute impairment of  the terms\n          of the distribution relationship existing\n          between  it and  Casas,  . .  . [(2)]  to\n          abstain   from   appointing,    choosing,\n          designating   or   arranging  for   other\n          additional    distributors   and/or    in\n          substitution  of Casas[,] and . . . [(3)]\n          to   abstain   from  terminating   and/or\n          altering  the  distribution  relationship\n          existing   between    both   parties   or\n          performing any act or omission whatsoever\n          in  impairment  thereof, all  pursuant to\n          the provisions of Law 75.\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\ntime of Casas's  nonperformance, (4)  a permanent  injunction\n\nmay be  ordered under Law 75,  and (5) Mita  had impaired its\n\ncontractual  relationship  with  Casas.    Consequently,  the\n\nmagistrate judge  recommended that  the  district court  deny\n\nMita's motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, and grant\n\nCasas's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\n          In  its opinion  and  order filed  on November  18,\n\n1993,  the  district  court  adopted all  of  the  magistrate\n\njudge's  recommendations,  thereby  granting  Casas's  cross-\n\nmotion  for summary judgment on its Law 75 claims (Counts One\n\nand  Three).4    Casas   Office  Machines  v.

In a judgment\r                    \n\nentered  the  same  day,  the district  court  denied  Mita's\n\nmotions  to dismiss  and  for summary  judgment, and  granted\n\nCasas's motion for  an injunction permanently enjoining  Mita\n\nfrom  impairing  the  1989  Agreement  without  just  cause.5\r                                                                       \n\nMita,  pursuant to  28 U.S.C.    1292(a)(1)  (1988),6 appeals\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  The district court did  not decide Counts Two, Four,  and\nFive of Casas's complaint, and, to our knowledge, they remain\nunresolved. \n\n5.  The district  court emphasized  in its opinion  and order\nthat  it  was  not  placing Mita  in  involuntary  servitude.\nAccording  to  the  district  court, Mita  could  impair  its\ncontractual relationship with Casas in the future if it could\ndemonstrate just cause for doing so.\n\n6.

Mita argues  principally:\n\n(1) that diversity jurisdiction  was defeated when Caguas and\n\nOficentro were substituted for the fictitious defendants; (2)\n\nthat  the district court improperly entered summary judgment;\n\nand (3) that the district court improperly issued a permanent\n\ninjunction.\n\n                             II.\n\n          Before  we  reach  the  issue   of  subject  matter\n\njurisdiction,   we  respond  to   Casas's  challenge  to  our\n\nappellate jurisdiction.

But,  contrary   to  Mita's  assertions,  we\n\nconclude that Caguas  and Oficentro are dispensable  parties.\n\nMita's principal  contention is that  Casas is barred  by the\n\ndoctrine of judicial estoppel  from asserting that Caguas and\n\nOficentro are dispensable parties  because Casas, in a motion\n\nrequesting relief from the automatic stay, represented to the\n\nUnited  States Bankruptcy  Court for  the District  of Puerto\n\nRico  that Oficentro  is  an indispensable  party.

Here, it\r                            \n\ndoes not appear that Casas succeeded in gaining any advantage\n\nas a result of its earlier inconsistent statement made to the\n\nbankruptcy  court.  While the court granted Casas's motion to\n\nlift  the stay,  it  did so  on  grounds other  than  Casas's\n\nrepresentation  that Caguas and Oficentro were indispensable.\n\nMita  itself does  not  allege  that  it  relied  on  or  was\n\nprejudiced by the statement in any way.  There is the further\n\nfact that Mita  has played as \"fast  and loose\" as  has Casas\n\nwith the issue of  subject matter jurisdiction.  It  was Mita\n\n   the party now seeking remand to the Commonwealth courts   \n\nthat removed the  case here.   After  the fictitious  parties\n\nwere identified, it made no effort to remand.  Only after the\n\ndistrict court ruled against it  did Mita decide that federal\n\njurisdiction  was a mistake.   We conclude that  Casas is not\n\nestopped from taking the position it adopts now.

It  submits  that, because  the\n\npermanent  injunction  compels  it  to  resume  an  exclusive\n\ndistribution relationship with Casas  in the Greater San Juan\n\narea,   Caguas's  and   Oficentro's  contractual   rights  to\n\ndistribute  Mita  products  in  that  area   are  necessarily\n\ncanceled.   Moreover, Mita points out that Casas is seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment decreeing Mita's distribution agreements\n\nwith  Caguas  and  Oficentro  null and  void.    Under  these\n\ncircumstances, says  Mita, this action cannot  \"in equity and\n\ngood conscience\" proceed without  Caguas and Oficentro, which\n\nare entitled to protect their contractual interests.   We are\n\nnot persuaded.  A leading commentator writes:\n\n          When  a  person is  not  a  party to  the\n          contract  in litigation and has no rights\n          or obligations under that  contract, even\n          though  he may have  obligated himself to\n          abide by the result of the pending action\n          by another contract that is not at issue,\n          he   will   not   be   regarded   as   an\n          indispensable   party   in   a  suit   to\n          determine obligations  under the disputed\n\n                    \r                                \n\n9.

We do not agree, however, with Mita's\n\nsuggestion that these records  would have been beyond Casas's\n\nreach  had  Caguas  and  Oficentro  not  been  designated  as\n\nparties.  Under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 34(c), \"A person not a party\n\nto  the  action may  be  compelled to  produce  documents and\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\nthings  or to  submit to  an inspection  as provided  in Rule\n\n45.\"10\n\n          Thus, neither  Casas nor Mita  gained a significant\n\ntactical advantage by the presence of Caguas and Oficentro in\n\nthe lawsuit.  Nevertheless, we  are concerned that Caguas and\n\nOficentro could  themselves face prejudice if  dismissed from\n\nthis   suit.     Caguas   and   Oficentro,  while   initially\n\ncharacterized as John Doe  and Richard Roe, were contemplated\n\nas  parties  to  this litigation  from  the  start,  and have\n\nactively participated in  it since  June of  1992, when  they\n\nwere  substituted for  the  fictitious defendants.   Had  the\n\njurisdictional  defect been  called to  the  district court's\n\nattention at that point, the district court would have either\n\ndismissed  Caguas and  Oficentro  from  this action,  thereby\n\nrequiring Casas  to sue  them separately in  the commonwealth\n\ncourt,  or joined them to  this action, thereby remanding the\n\nentire  case to the  commonwealth court.   Either way, Caguas\n\nand Oficentro  would have had their liability determined in a\n\nsingle proceeding.   Instead,  because of the  jurisdictional\n\noversight, dismissal  of Caguas  and Oficentro at  this stage\n\ncould subject them to a new lawsuit before a new judge in the\n\nSuperior Court of Puerto Rico.  \n\n                    \r                                \n\n10.  Mita baldly  asserts that  Casas could not  have secured\nunder Rule 45 the documents and information it obtained under\nRules  33 and 34.

Mita  disputes this  holding  on appeal.\n\nHowever, Mita did not  dispute impairment before the district\n\ncourt and, therefore,  waived its right to  make the argument\n\non  appeal.   Even without  the presumption,  moreover, Casas\n\npresented  ample  evidence  of impairment  of  the  exclusive\n\ndealership   through  Mita's   appointment   of  Caguas   and\n\nOficentro,  evidence which Mita did  not dispute.

Because  many  such  termination\n\nclauses were tied to distribution quotas or goals, amendments\n\nto Law 75  in 1988 clarified what  \"just cause\" meant  in the\n\ncontext of contracts that contain such clauses:\n\n          The  violation  or nonperformance  by the\n          dealer of  any provision included  in the\n          dealer's contract fixing rules of conduct\n          or distribution quotas  or goals  because\n          it does not  adjust to  the realities  of\n\n                             -28-\r\r\n\n          the Puerto Rican  market at  the time  of\n          the  violation  or nonperformance  by the\n          dealer  shall not  be deemed  just cause.\n          The   burden   of  proof   to   show  the\n          reasonableness of the  rule of conduct or\n          of the quota or  goal fixed shall rest on\n          the principal or grantor.\n\nP.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 10,   278a-1(c)(1988).  Thus  failure to\n\nmeet a distribution quota will only constitute just cause for\n\nimpairment  under Law  75  if  that  quota  is  shown  to  be\n\n\"reasonable\"  given the state  of the Puerto  Rican market at\n\nthe  time of the alleged  violation.

Under Law 75, however, Mita\n\ncould  not impair its contract without just cause.  Under the\n\nabove  provisions  of  Law  75,  Mita  had  \"just  cause\"  to\n\nterminate  the exclusivity  provision only  if the  quota was\n\nadjusted to the realities  of the Puerto Rican market  at the\n\ntime of Casas's failure to meet the quota.

Thus, to preserve the exclusivity provision, Casas\nhad to  sell 255 copiers (85%  of 300).  If  Casas fell below\n255 copiers, it could  still retain a nonexclusive dealership\nunless  its sales were 50%  below quota, in  which event Mita\ncould terminate any relationship whatsoever. \n\n                             -29-\r\r\n\nplaces  on  Mita's  shoulders   the  burden  of  proving  the\n\nreasonableness  of the  quota.

In that letter,  Mita stated it  was terminating the\n\nexclusivity  provision  in  the  contract  because  Casas had\n\nfailed  to  meet  the  quota  percentages  set  forth  in the\n\ncontract.\n\n          Mita  further submitted  the declaration  of Rafael\n\nMartinez  Margarida, the  Managing  Partner  and  Partner-in-\n\nCharge of Management Consulting Services at Price Waterhouse.\n\nMita  retained Martinez as an expert witness to testify as to\n\nthe   reasonableness  of   the  contract   quota.     In  his\n\ndeclaration, Martinez stated  that he examined  Puerto Rico's\n\nExternal  Trade Statistics  (\"PRETS\")  for  imports  of  copy\n\nmachines to Puerto  Rico for  the period of  1985-1990.   The\n\ndeclaration included the following table:\n\nYEAR    QTY.

Martinez also noted that the quota in\n\nthe contract was a projection  based on Casas's actual  sales\n\nfigures in 1985 (279  units), 1986 (153 units) and  1987 (230\n\nunits).  Finally, Martinez noted that  Casas's sales for 1989\n\n(80  units) and  1990  (110  units) decreased  significantly,\n\nwhile  the overall  number of  imports increased  during that\n\n                             -31-\r\r\n\nsame  period.     Martinez  concluded  that   the  quota  was\n\nreasonable given the historical  trend, that Casas \"failed to\n\ncapitalize  on  the  opportunities  available  in  a  growing\n\nmarket,\"  and that its failure  to meet the  quota \"cannot be\n\nattributable to the conditions of  the Puerto Rico market for\n\nphotocopying machines.\"\n\n          Casas points to various alleged flaws in Martinez's\n\nmethodology,  and argues  that these  flaws require  that his\n\ndeclaration  be   completely  excluded  as   unprobative  and\n\nincompetent.  Casas  argues that, in  failing to deduct  from\n\nthe import figures the number of copiers exported from Puerto\n\nRico, Martinez based his conclusions on an inaccurate picture\n\nof  the internal copier market.  Casas also argues that these\n\nsame  import figures  include  imports of  all categories  of\n\ncopiers,  not just the categories of  copiers that Casas sold\n\nas part of  its exclusive dealership  agreement, and thus  do\n\nnot accurately reflect the precise market in  which Casas was\n\noperating.12   Casas  also  argues that  the quota,  although\n\nbased  on historical  sales  figures,  unreasonably  required\n\n                    \r                                \n\n12.  Casas also  argues that the yearly  data was irrelevant,\nsince Mita must provide evidence about the market on or about\nMay  1990, when the contract was terminated.  This is plainly\nwrong.  Law 75  requires Mita to prove the  reasonableness of\nthe  quota \"at the time of the violation or nonperformance by\nthe  dealer.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit.  10,   278a-1(c).  Casas's\nalleged nonperformance  occurred  during the  period  between\nApril 1989 and May 1990.  Under the plain terms of Law 75, it\nis the condition  of the  market during that  period that  is\nrelevant,  not the  condition of  the  market at  the precise\npoint of the contract's impairment by the supplier.\n\n                             -32-\r\r\n\nCasas  to double  its market  share in  13 months.   Finally,\n\nCasas  argues  that  Martinez  failed  to   consider  various\n\nrelevant  factors in  his analysis,  including the  effect of\n\nincreased  intrabrand competition,  changes in the  number of\n\ndealers  in the market, the effect of Hurricane Hugo, and the\n\nimpact of  the local economic recession.   Accordingly, Casas\n\nargues, Martinez's  declaration must be excluded,  and Mita's\n\nremaining evidence  is insufficient to raise  a genuine issue\n\nof fact.\n\n          The district  court found  that Mita had  failed to\n\npresent  evidence sufficient to  raise a genuine  issue as to\n\nthe reasonableness of the quota.  The court stated:\n\n             The  magistrate  found, and  we agree,\n          that the quota provision was unreasonable\n          at the time of Casas' nonperformance.  In\n          support of its  claim that the  quota was\n          reasonable,  Mita presented  an unsworn13\n          declaration by Rafael Martinez Margarida,\n          a  certified public accountant (CPA).  In\n          this  declaration  the CPA  asserted that\n          his  examination  of   the  Puerto   Rico\n          External Trade's [sic] Statistics (PRETS)\n          reflected    a    growing   market    for\n          photocopying  machine  imports  from  the\n          period of 1985 to 1990, inclusive.  Thus,\n          he concluded, Casas'  failure to meet the\n          quota  could not be  attributed to market\n          conditions.\n             As the magistrate found,  Casas proved\n          that   Mita's   argument  was   based  on\n          erroneous statistics.  Among  the factors\n          cited  by the  magistrate  which we  find\n          most convincing, the CPA's  report failed\n          to take into account essential aspects of\n\n                    \r                                \n\n13.  The  unsworn   declaration  was  made   under  pain  and\npenalties of perjury.  28 U.S.C.   1746.\n\n                             -33-\r\r\n\n          the  Puerto  Rican  market  such  as  the\n          effects   of   Hurricane  Hugo   and  the\n          recession  on  the  economy.    The CPA's\n          report also failed  to take into  account\n          the  effect  of  intrabrand   rivalry  on\n          Casas's market share, a  rivalry fostered\n          by Mita's impairment of  Casas' exclusive\n          distributorship.\n             Additionally,  Mita's  data as  to the\n          market  for  copying  machines in  Puerto\n          Rico   erroneously   included  types   of\n          copying apparatus that were  not machines\n          manufactured by Mita  and sold to  Casas.\n          Thus,  Mita's  evidence  exaggerated  the\n          size of the market by including within it\n          devices such as thermocopying mechanisms,\n          which  were  not among  those apparatuses\n          made  and  sold  to Casas  by  Mita,  and\n          minimized market conditions by failing to\n          include   negative    factors   such   as\n          Hurricane   Hugo,   the  recession,   the\n          intrabrand rivalry etc.   Clearly, Mita's\n          evidence  fails  to  create a  sufficient\n          question to prevent the entry  of summary\n          judgment in Casas'  favor since Mita  has\n          the  burden of  proving that  the quota's\n          [sic]  were  reasonable  at  the  time of\n          Casas'  nonperformance,  given the  legal\n          presumption    that    they   were    not\n          unreasonable.\n             Thus,   it  was   \"unreliable,  lacked\n          probative value, and does  not constitute\n          competent evidence.\" [Citing Magistrate's\n          Report.]     Mita  claims  now  that  its\n          failure to submit more probative evidence\n          was due to  its lack of time  in which to\n          gather  and  present  it.

Casas\r                                                  \n\nargues  that the district  court properly excluded Martinez's\n\ndeclaration as based on flawed data and, faced with a lack of\n\nevidence  as to  the  reasonableness of  the quota,  properly\n\nentered summary judgment in its favor.  \n\nA.   Martinez's Declaration was not Excludable\r                                                          \n\n          It is not  clear that the  district court meant  to\n\ntreat Martinez's declaration as excludable under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(e).  The court nowhere articulated such  a ruling.  But\n\nif  we assume the court  meant to exclude  the declaration as\n\nincompetent for  summary judgment purposes, we  think it went\n\ntoo far.   We  may accept  that Martinez's  opinion, standing\n\nalone,  was  worth little  more  than the  inferences  a fact\n\nfinder might reasonably draw from  the factual data stated in\n\nhis  declaration.   Martinez was  not said  to have  had some\n\nspecial familiarity  with, or  expertise in, the  Puerto Rico\n\ncopier market, apart from the data he presented and sought to\n\ninterpret.    However, that  data,  including  the PRETS  and\n\nCasas's past sales figures, was admissible and, examined in a\n\nlight  most favorable  to Mita,  tends to  support Martinez's\n\nconclusion  that the quota was  reasonable.  We  see no basis\n\nunder  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(e)  for  excluding  the  entire\n\ndeclaration altogether. \n\n          Under  Rule 56(e),  an  affidavit must  meet  three\n\nrequirements.  It:\n\n                             -36-\r\r\n\n          [1]  shall be made on personal knowledge,\n          [2] shall set forth  such facts as  would\n          be admissible in evidence, and  [3] shall\n          show  affirmatively  that the  affiant is\n          competent  to  testify  to   the  matters\n          stated therein.\n\nFed.

Supp. at\r                                                       \n\n988.    But neither  Casas nor  the  court asserted  that the\n\nfigures in the declaration were not accurate reproductions of\n\nPuerto Rico's External Trade Statistics, nor did they dispute\n\nthe  correctness   of  the   other  data  mentioned   in  the\n\ndeclaration.   The court's reason for  calling the statistics\n\n\"erroneous\" seems not  to have been their  inaccuracy as such\n\nbut  rather  its  belief  that  they  did  not constitute  an\n\naccurate  measure  of the  Puerto  Rico copier  market.   The\n\ndistrict  court  also  criticized  the  alleged  failure   of\n\nMartinez's declaration to account for the impact of Hurricane\n\nHugo,  the effect of the  local recession, and  the impact of\n\nintrabrand rivalry, matters raised in Casas's materials.  \n\n          But the increase in copier imports between 1989 and\n\n1990, as reflected in  the PRETS, implicitly rebutted Casas's\n\nevidence that the hurricane and the local recession had had a\n\nmaterially adverse effect on  the Puerto Rican copier market.\n\nIn  finding that  the  declaration failed  to consider  these\n\n                             -38-\r\r\n\n\"essential  aspects\"  of  the  market,   the  district  court\n\noverlooked the  relevant inference  that could be  drawn from\n\nthe  rise in  copier imports  shown in  the PRETS  figures.15\n\nSee Adickes v.

Casas pointed to the\r                            \n\nfact  that the  1990 PRETS  figure included  imports of  five\n\ncategories of copiers, while Casas sold copiers in only three\n\nof  these categories.    This \"exaggerated  the  size of  the\n\nmarket.\"  The absolute  size of the market was  not, however,\n\nthe issue.   Rather, the issue was  the trend in  the market,\n\ni.e. whether the market was increasing or decreasing, whether\n\nCasas's sales were consistent with the trend, and whether the\n\nquota was  consistent with  Casas's historical market  share.\n\nMartinez explained in his deposition that it was necessary to\n\ninclude the  additional categories in the  1990 PRETS figures\n\nin  order to  obtain comparable yearly  data, since  prior to\n\nthat year the data for the copier market had  not been broken\n\nup  into the  five  subcategories.   The  inclusion of  these\n\ncategories did  not necessarily make his  testimony about the\n\n                             -40-\r\r\n\ntrend in the market any less probative.  Casas did not attack\n\nthe  comparability  of  the  figures and  failed  to  present\n\nevidence suggesting  that excluding the  categories, if  this\n\nhad indeed been possible, would have resulted in a  different\n\ntrend.  \n\n          We  conclude  that the  reasons  set  forth by  the\n\ndistrict  court were  insufficient  bases  for rejecting  the\n\nMartinez declaration altogether,  assuming this was what  the\n\ncourt  intended to  do.   Nor do  we find  Casas's additional\n\narguments  sufficient  for  its  outright  exclusion.   Casas\n\ncomplains: that Martinez failed to deduct export figures from\n\nthe  import figures in order to  obtain a true measure of the\n\ninternal copier market; that  Martinez failed to consider the\n\nfact that  the quota, according  to Casas, required  Casas to\n\ndouble its market share within thirteen months; that Martinez\n\nfailed to consider  the fact  that during the  period of  the\n\ncontract, Casas had a  smaller region of exclusive dealership\n\nthan before.  \n\n          While  these additional  arguments are  not without\n\nforce, a party may not exclude, on summary judgment, relevant\n\nand  otherwise  admissible  factual evidence  solely  on  the\n\nground  that  the  evidence  leaves a  number  of  unanswered\n\nquestions or  that it  appears somewhat less  persuasive than\n\nthe  movant's evidence  offered  in rebuttal.

First,  the contract executed  by the parties\n\ncontains a  clause in which  Casas expressly agreed  that the\n\nquota  was reasonable in light of the realities of the Puerto\n\nRico  market.   We  do not  suggest that  such  a clause  was\n\n                             -43-\r\r\n\nbinding, since public policy  would presumably not permit the\r                   \n\nprovisions  of Law 75 to  be contracted away.17   However, we\n\nthink  Casas's express  agreement  in the  contract that  the\n\nquota  was  reasonable  is  admissible  evidence  tending  to\n\nestablish the reasonableness  of the quota at  the time Casas\n\nsigned  the  contract.    Bolstering the  weight  of  Casas's\n\nconcession  were  the  letters   from  Mita's  attorneys  and\n\nIshidoya's testimony showing  that Casas had been  successful\n\nin renegotiating  the quota downward from 500 to 300 copiers.\n\nIts ability  to do  so suggests  a  degree of  parity in  the\n\nparties' bargaining  positions, making  it  more likely  that\n\nCasas  really believed the quota to be reasonable at the time\n\nit signed the contract.18\n\n          In   addition,  inferences   from  the   PRETS  and\n\nhistorical sales figures  contained in Martinez's declaration\n\n                    \r                                \n\n17.

Casas argues that any  evidence of reasonableness of the\nquota at a  time prior  to the period  of nonperformance  was\nirrelevant here.  However, viewed in the light most favorable\nto Mita, we think that evidence of reasonableness immediately\nprior to the  term of  the contract was  material.   Combined\nwith Martinez's declaration indicating  that the Puerto  Rico\ncopier market did not subsequently decrease, but rather grew,\nthis evidence  is probative of the  continuing reasonableness\nof  the quota between April  1989 and May  1990, the relevant\nperiod.  See note </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">12,</span> supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\r                                       \n\n                             -44-\r\r\n\nsuggest that if  the quota was  reasonable when the  contract\n\nwas signed, it remained  so during the term of  the contract.\n\nThe  contract required Casas to sell 255 copiers (85% of 300)\n\nduring  a 13-month  period in order  to retain  its exclusive\n\ndealership.  This  figure was  not grossly out  of line  with\n\nCasas's historical 12-month sales  figures: (297 in 1985, 153\n\nin 1986, and  230 in 1987).  The  PRETS figures indicate that\n\nthe market for copiers actually increased during  the term of\n\nthe contract (from  7,056 in 1989 to 8,983 in  1990).  If the\n\nquota  was based roughly on past sales, and if the market for\n\ncopiers did  not suffer  any decrease, it  could be  inferred\n\nfrom  this evidence that the quota was reasonable in light of\n\nthe Puerto Rico market.  \n\n          Casas,  to  be  sure,  presented   much  persuasive\n\nevidence in opposition.  Summary judgment, however, is  not a\n\nsubstitute  for trial.  We  do not think  Casas's evidence so\n\nundermined Mita's case that  Mita can be said to  have failed\n\nto   raise   a  genuine   issue   of   fact  concerning   the\n\nreasonableness of the quota.  At most, it indicated that many\n\nissues  of  fact remained  to be  resolved  at trial.   Casas\n\npresented  a declaration  by its  president, stating  that he\n\nthought the quota unreasonable and that Mita had imposed  the\n\nquota unilaterally by threatening to cancel their preexisting\n\ndistribution relationship.   Mita's vice  president, however,\n\nasserted that  he \"relied on Casas'  representations that the\n\n                             -45-\r\r\n\nperformance goal and the related  percentages were reasonable\n\nfor the relevant  market.\"  Mita's evidence tends  to suggest\n\nthat  the  quota was  arrived  at  through bargaining,  Casas\n\nhaving  persuaded Mita  to lower  the quota  from 500  to 300\n\ncopiers.   The Casas  declaration also states  that Hurricane\n\nHugo  and the  local recession  had an  effect on  the copier\n\nmarket.  As  we have previously  said, however, Mita's  PRETS\n\nfigures minimized  these effects  by showing that  the copier\n\nmarket increased during the term of the contract.  \n\n          Casas's   strongest   argument   is   that   Mita's\n\nstatistical evidence of market growth and of past sales fails\n\nto account  for the fact  that, prior to 1988,  Casas was the\n\nonly distributor  of Mita  products  for all  of Puerto  Rico\n\n(even  though  its  contract  then  was  nonexclusive).    By\n\ncontrast,  during the term of the  contract, Casas argues, it\n\nfaced stiff intrabrand competition.  Its exclusive dealership\n\ncovered only a portion  of Puerto Rico, the greater  San Juan\n\narea.   While it could  also sell Mita  products elsewhere in\n\nPuerto Rico on a nonexclusive basis, it now faced competition\n\nfrom two other authorized  Mita dealers outside the exclusive\n\nSan Juan area as  well as from alleged unauthorized  sales of\n\nMita's copiers by Caguas and Oficentro.  According to  Casas,\n\nits  competitors sold  327 Mita  copiers during  the 13-month\n\nperiod  of the contract.  Casas argues that Mita's past sales\n\nfigures simply  do not  address the  issue of this  increased\n\n                             -46-\r\r\n\nintrabrand  competition, hence  they  say nothing  as to  the\n\nquota's reasonableness during the relevant period.\n\n          But  we   do  not  think  that   this  argument  so\n\nundermines Mita's case as  to eliminate any contested factual\n\nissue.  It is unclear how to assess the effects of intrabrand\n\ncompetition in  calculating the reasonableness of  the quota.\n\nThe fact that  other nonexclusive dealers  were able to  sell\n\n327  Mita copiers during  the relevant period  outside of San\n\nJuan is a double-edged sword.  While, to be sure, these sales\n\nsuggest that Casas faced stern competition, it also indicates\n\nthe  existence of a strong  demand for Mita  copiers on which\n\nCasas  was presumably free to capitalize to the extent it was\n\ncapable.    It  is  unclear,  moreover,  in  measuring  quota\n\nreasonableness,  how   intrabrand   competition  is   to   be\n\ndistinguished from the  effects of  competition from  copiers\n\nmade by  other  manufacturers.   Such interbrand  competition\n\nwould have existed earlier as well as  in 1989-90.  While the\n\nnew  factor of  intrabrand competition doubtless  weakens the\n\npredictive value  of Casas's  earlier sales figures,  it does\n\nnot totally vitiate their  relevance to quota reasonableness.\n\nCasas knew when  it signed the contract  that its exclusivity\n\nwould  be limited to the  San Juan area,  and presumably also\n\nknew of the  intrabrand competition it faced  elsewhere.  The\n\nevidence permits  an inference that in  Casas's then judgment\n\nthe quota was  reasonable despite the  anticipated interbrand\n\n                             -47-\r\r\n\nand intrabrand competition.  Thereafter, the overall trend in\n\ncopier imports was up suggesting    at least, as one possible\n\ninterpretation of  the data    that  Casas's poor performance\n\nwas  due not to lack of opportunity  but to some fault of its\n\nown.\n\n          We conclude that Mita presented evidence sufficient\n\nto  raise a  genuine issue  as to  the reasonableness  of the\n\nquota.       Particularly    where   the    standard    here,\n\n\"reasonableness,\" is  so  amorphous, and  \"hard\" evidence  to\n\nprove \"reasonableness\" so obviously  difficult to come by and\n\nsubject  to multiple  interpretations, we are  disinclined to\n\ndeny Mita its day  in court by raising the  threshold barrier\n\nof proof too high.

See First\r                                                                         \n\nNat'l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv.

We  conclude  that Mita  has\n\npresented  evidence sufficient  to raise  a genuine  issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to the reasonableness of the quota given the\n\ncondition of  the Puerto Rican  copier market.   Weighing the\n\nevidence, assessing the credibility of the experts: these are\n\ntask that must be left to the trier of fact.19  \n\n                    \r                                \n\n19.  Without making too much  of this, we note that  Casas in\nits brief almost concedes that there exist disputed issues of\nfact.   After listing  the  evidence it  presented about  the\nunreasonableness of the quota, it states: \"Among others, this\nevidence raises material  questions of fact as  to the effect\nof Hurricane Hugo, the recession, the  intrabrand competition\nof  MITA  machines,  and   the  manipulation  of  statistical\ninformation by MITA's expert  in order to artificially create\na 'growing market'.\"  We agree.\n\n                             -49-\r\r\n\n                              V.\n\n          In accordance with this opinion, we  hereby dismiss\n\nCaguas  and  Oficentro  from  this suit  and  remand  to  the\n\ndistrict court  to determine whether the  dismissal of Caguas\n\nand Oficentro  should be with  or without prejudice.   Having\n\ndetermined that the district  court erred in granting Casas's\n\nmotion for  partial summary  judgment, we vacate  the court's\n\norder granting  Casas a  permanent injunction.   The parties'\n\nclaims will  proceed in the district  court consistently with\n\nthis opinion.20\n\n          So ordered.  Each party shall bear its own costs.\r                                                                      \n\n                    \r                                \n\n20.  We do not reach Mita's remaining argument that,  even if\nsummary judgment was proper, the district court's issuance of\nthe permanent injunction was improper.\n\n                             -50-\r\r\n</pre>",
