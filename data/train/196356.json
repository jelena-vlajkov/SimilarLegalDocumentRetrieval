(\"UBI\") seeks  review  of  the decision  of  the\r\n\nrespondent, the  National Labor  Relations Board (\"the  Board\" or\r\n\n\"the  NLRB\"), ordering  UBI  to supply  requested information  to\r\n\nDistrict Council 94, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners\r\n\nof America, AFL-CIO (the \"Union\").  The NLRB cross-applies, under\r\n\n   10(e)  of the  National Labor  Relations  Act (\"the  Act\"), 29\r\n\nU.S.C.   160(e),  for enforcement of its order against  UBI.  The\r\n\nBoard  has ordered  UBI  to cease  and  desist from  violating   \r\n\n8(a)(5) and (1)  of the Act, 29  U.S.C.    158(a)(1)  and (a)(5),\r\n\nfurnish the  Union with  the information  it requested,  and post\r\n\nappropriate notices.   For the  following reasons, we  affirm the\r\n\nBoard's Decision and Order.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In  1989, a  Rhode Island  company called O.  Ahlborg &amp;\r\n\nSons (\"O.  Ahlborg\") executed a three-year  collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement (\"CBA\")  with the Union.   On or about  March 24, 1992,\r\n\nO. Ahlborg notified  the Union that  it planned to  terminate the\r\n\nagreement as of  May 31,  1992, as was  O. Ahlborg's  contractual\r\n\nright.  As  a result  of collective bargaining  with the  Union's\r\n\nthen business manager (Herbert F. Holmes), O. Ahlborg  reached an\r\n\nagreement  (the  \"Holmes-Ahlborg   Agreement\")  with  the   Union\r\n\n(confirmed by a letter dated May 29, 1992) whereby a new employer\r\n\nentity,  UBI,   would  be  formed.     Under  the  Holmes-Ahlborg\r\n\nAgreement, UBI would enter into a collective bargaining agreement\r\n\n(the  \"new  CBA\") with  the Union  and  would continue  all union\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nbargaining unit work  performed at that time by  O. Ahlborg.  The\r\n\nBoard found that the Holmes-Ahlborg Agreement also provided that,\r\n\nas  between UBI  and  O.  Ahlborg,  UBI  would  be  allotted  all\r\n\nprevailing rate jobs.\r\n\n          Additionally, under the  Holmes-Ahlborg Agreement,  UBI\r\n\nwould  assume all employees currently performing union bargaining\r\n\nunit work for O. Ahlborg,  and there would be no  interruption in\r\n\nproduction,  employment or  wages  of union  members despite  the\r\n\ntermination of the O. Ahlborg-Union CBA.  Shortly thereafter, UBI\r\n\nand the Union entered into the new CBA, which provided that\r\n\n            [UBI]  will  not  subcontract   any  work\r\n            covered  by the  terms of  this agreement\r\n            which is  to be performed  at the jobsite\r\n            except  to  a  contractor  who  holds  an\r\n            agreement with the United  Brotherhood of\r\n            Carpenters and Joiners of America, or one\r\n            of  its  subordinate   bodies,  or,   who\r\n            agrees,  in writing, prior  to or  at the\r\n            time  of   the  execution  of   the  sub-\r\n            contract,  to be  bound  by the  terms of\r\n            this agreement.\r\n\nThe new CBA covered the period from June 1, 1992 to June 4, 1995.\r\n\n          On  December 8,  1993,  David F.  Palmisciano, who  had\r\n\nreplaced Holmes  as union business representative,  sent a letter\r\n\nto UBI's  chief executive  Eric Ahlborg, expressing  concern that\r\n\nUBI  was \"operating  a second  company\" as  \"an alter ego.\"   The\r\n\nletter  also requested that Eric  Ahlborg fill out  and return an\r\n\nenclosed  questionnaire.  Eric  Ahlborg refused  to reply  to the\r\n\nquestionnaire.\r\n\n          Subsequently,  the matter came before an administrative\r\n\nlaw  judge  (\"ALJ\")  on  the  NLRB  General  Counsel's  complaint\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nalleging that UBI  violated    8(a)(5) and 8(a)(1)  of the Act by\r\n\nrefusing  to  furnish  information  that the  Union  alleged  was\r\n\nnecessary  for, and relevant to, the performance of its duties as\r\n\nthe  exclusive  collective-bargaining   representative  of   unit\r\n\nemployees.   Palmisciano  testified  before an  ALJ that,  during\r\n\nthree previous onsite inspections,  he saw evidence that UBI  had\r\n\nviolated his interpretation of the Holmes-Ahlborg Agreement: that\r\n\nas  between O.  Ahlborg  and UBI,  UBI  would garner  all  state,\r\n\nFederal  and  other  work  with  high  wage  rates,  particularly\r\n\n\"prevailing  rates,\" and  that such  work would  all go  to union\r\n\ncarpenters.\r\n\n           The ALJ  concluded that the  Union reasonably believed\r\n\nthat  UBI  was  operating  O.  Ahlborg  as  an  \"alter  ego\"  and\r\n\nsubcontracting  in a  manner  that  violated  the  Holmes-Ahlborg\r\n\nAgreement's  award of prevailing rate  jobs to UBI  and its union\r\n\nmember  employees  only.1    Thus,  the ALJ  concluded  that  the\r\n\nUnion's reasonable belief justified the  request for information,\r\n\nand ordered UBI to comply.  The Board affirmed the ALJ's rulings,\r\n\nfindings and conclusions, and adopted his recommended Order.  UBI\r\n\nseeks review of the Board's decision, and the Board cross-applies\r\n\nfor enforcement of its order against UBI.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   UBI was organized  as a Rhode  Island corporation on  June 1,\r\n1992, to  engage  in the  business of  building construction  and\r\nrelated activities.   UBI's officers are related  to, and overlap\r\nsubstantially with,  those of  O. Ahlborg.    For example,  UBI's\r\nchief executive, Eric Ahlborg,  is the son of O.  Ahlborg's chief\r\nexecutive; UBI's vice president  is the daughter of  O. Ahlborg's\r\nchief executive; and UBI's chief financial officer, who holds the\r\nsame position at O. Ahlborg, is another son of O. Ahlborg's chief\r\nexecutive.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n                     II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                               II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We will  enforce a Board  order if the  Board correctly\r\n\napplied  the  law  and  if  substantial  evidence  on the  record\r\n\nsupports the Board's  factual findings.

NLRB  v.  Acme\r                                                                           \r\n\nIndustrial  Co., 385 U.S. 432, 435-36 (1967); NLRB v.

Thus, an\r                          \r\n\nemployer  must  produce information  that  is  \"relevant to  [the\r\n\nbargaining   representative's]  duties,\"   including  information\r\n\nnecessary to police the  CBA.

Because the duty to bargain \"unquestionably extends\r\n\nbeyond the  period of contract negotiations and applies to labor-\r\n\nmanagement relations during  the term of  an agreement,\" NLRB  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nAcme  Industrial Co.,  385  U.S. at  436,  the Union  could  have\r                              \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nrequested the information simply because of its relevance to  its\r\n\nongoing agreement with  UBI.   In this regard,  we note that  the\r\n\nBoard  may  determine that  the employer  has  a duty  to provide\r\n\ninformation if it  finds even \"a probability that the information\r                                                      \r\n\nis relevant  and that it will be of  use to the union in carrying\r\n\nout  its statutory duties.\"  NLRB  v.

Ahlborg  and UBI, and thereby waived  its right\r\n\nto challenge  O.  Ahlborg as  UBI's  alter ego.   UBI  has  cited\r\n\nneither legal authority nor requisite factual evidence to support\r\n\nits waiver argument.   Furthermore, nothing in the Holmes-Ahlborg\r\n\nAgreement shows an unequivocal  waiver by the Union of  its right\r\n\nto investigate the alleged diversion  to O. Ahlborg of prevailing\r\n\nrate jobs.  Communication Workers of America AFL-CIO, Local  1051\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  NLRB,  644 F.2d  923,  927 (1st  Cir.  1981) (\"the  union may\r                  \r\n\nrelinquish  a statutory  right only  by 'clear  and unmistakable'\r\n\nwaiver\")  (quoting NLRB v. Perkins Machine Co., 326 F.2d 488, 489\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1964)).  Finally,  the ALJ specifically rejected  UBI's\r\n\nwaiver argument based on the facts presented.\r\n\n          The  ALJ correctly distinguished  the issue  of whether\r\n\nUBI must  supply  the requested  information  from the  issue  of\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nwhether O. Ahlborg and  UBI are in  fact intertwined in an  alter\r\n\nego relationship.  We agree that only the information issue bears\r\n\non this case.  With respect  to this issue, we are persuaded that\r\n\nwe should apply a \"discovery-type\" standard so that the Union may\r\n\ngather  \"'a broad range of  potentially useful information  . . .\r\n\nfor the purpose of  effectuating the bargaining process'.\"   NLRB\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

In  particular, the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt has stressed  that the  Board should apply  a more  liberal\r\n\nstandard of relevance  to information requests under  the duty to\r\n\nbargain in good  faith than would be appropriate  at trial.  NLRB\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Acme  Industrial Co., 385 U.S.  432, 437 &amp; n.6  (1967).  Thus,\r                                 \r\n\nthe Union  cannot be required to  prove that UBI is  in breach of\r\n\nits CBA  or that O. Ahlborg  is UBI's alter ego  before the Union\r\n\ncan receive  information that could help  prove such allegations.\r\n\nIn deciding to  apply such  a standard, the  ALJ correctly  noted\r\n\nthat such information  does not  only benefit unions.   In  fact,\r\n\nrequiring  employers  to  divulge  information  of  even   merely\r\n\npotential  relevance improves  the efficiency of  the arbitration\r\n\nsystem  as a whole, since  otherwise, unions might  be forced \"to\r\n\ntake grievances all the way through to arbitration without [] the\r\n\nopportunity to evaluate the  merits of the  claim.\"  Id. at  438.\r                                                                 \r\n\nAs a policy matter,  employers as a whole may also benefit, since\r\n\nthe information they supply may generally aid unions in filtering\r\n\nout meritless cases.

The record supports\r\n\nthe finding that Palmisciano reasonably believed that the purpose\r\n\nof the Holmes-Ahlborg Agreement  was to permit O. Ahlborg  to bid\r\n\nnonunion work and  to award  all \"prevailing rate\"  jobs to  UBI.\r\n\nFurthermore, the Union  had entered the new CBA with  UBI.  Thus,\r\n\nthe ALJ and the Board correctly concluded that the questionnaire,\r\n\nwith  its  inquiries into  UBI's ownership,  corporate directors,\r\n\nsuppliers  and  relationship  to  an  alleged nonunion  employer,\r\n\nsought   information   necessary   to  Palmisciano's   collective\r\n\nbargaining duties.\r\n\n          The ALJ  heard testimony from Palmisciano regarding the\r\n\nlatter's observations at three  different job sites.  Palmisciano\r\n\ntestified that at the three sites, all with O. Ahlborg as general\r\n\ncontractor  and paying prevailing rates, he had seen Union member\r\n\nUBI employees supervising nonunion employees doing unit work, and\r\n\nhe  had seen both Union member UBI employees and nonunion workers\r\n\ndoing  unit  work  for  subcontractors.   Additionally,  the  ALJ\r\n\nquestioned  Palmisciano regarding  the  meaning  of  the  Holmes-\r\n\nAhlborg Agreement,  especially with  respect to the  allotment of\r\n\nwork between O. Ahlborg and UBI.  Furthermore, the ALJ questioned\r\n\nPalmisciano  regarding O.  Ahlborg's  responses to  Palmisciano's\r\n\ndemands  that O.  Ahlborg use  union subcontractors  on carpentry\r\n\nwork at the three job sites.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          While UBI takes  offense at the  ALJ's refusal to  hear\r\n\nEric Ahlborg's testimony to  show that UBI and  O. Ahlborg had  a\r\n\ndifferent  understanding  of  the Holmes-Ahlborg  Agreement,  the\r\n\nissue  before  the  ALJ  was  whether  Palmisciano  could  supply\r\n\nobjective evidence  supporting a reasonable belief  that made his\r\n\ninformation request relevant to his collective bargaining duties.\r\n\nNaturally,  the  ALJ  drew  his conclusions  primarily  from  the\r\n\ntestimony  of Palmisciano, since  the chief issue  was whether or\r\n\nnot Palmisciano's beliefs were reasonable given objective facts.\r\n\n          UBI also argues that  because objective facts show that\r\n\nit is not operating an alter ego,  Palmisciano could not have had\r\n\na reasonable  belief that would render  the requested information\r\n\nrelevant.  The proposition that a union's information request may\r\n\nbe  denied if  the company  in question  can show  that objective\r\n\nfacts  render the  union's  concerns  untenable appears  logical.\r\n\nSee, e.g., San  Diego Newspaper Guild v. NLRB, 548  F.2d 863, 867\r                                                       \r\n\n(9th Cir. 1977)  (\"If the information requested has  no relevance\r\n\nto any legitimate union collective  bargaining need, a refusal to\r\n\nfurnish it could not be an unfair labor practice.\").  However, in\r\n\nthe  instant  case,  the  issue  is  moot,  since  even  if  this\r\n\nproposition were  settled law applicable  here, UBI has  not made\r\n\nthe required showing.\r\n\n          In  the course of this argument, UBI relies on the fact\r\n\nthat  the relationship  between  it and  O.  Ahlborg is  not  the\r\n\nclassic alter ego  situation of \"a  disguised continuance of  the\r\n\nold  employer.\"  Therefore, runs the argument, because O. Ahlborg\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nis not  UBI's alter ego, the Union  cannot demonstrate reasonable\r\n\nbelief  necessary   to  support  its  request   for  information.\r\n\nHowever, this argument must fail for two reasons.\r\n\n          First, UBI  argues that this Court  has previously used\r\n\nthe  existence of a motive to evade labor law responsibilities in\r\n\ncorporate organization as a  factor in identifying an alter  ego,\r\n\nNLRB  v. Hospital  San Rafael,  Inc., 42  F.3d  45, 50  (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1994), and that no  \"disguise\" or motive existed here,  since the\r\n\nUnion knew and  agreed to the  creation of UBI  from O.  Ahlborg.\r\n\nHowever, in Hospital San Rafael, the Court also called cases that\r                                         \r\n\ninvolve formation  of new entities with  direct evasionary intent\r\n\nonly \"the easiest  example[s]\" of  alter egos.   Id.   Presumably\r                                                             \r\n\nthere are also harder examples, as the Union may show here.\r\n\n          Additionally,  even if  the issue  before us  here were\r\n\nwhether  O. Ahlborg  constituted  UBI's   alter  ego,  the  paper\r\n\nrelationship   between  the   two  corporations   would  not   be\r\n\ndispositive,  since  the  alter  ego doctrine  looks  behind  the\r\n\ncorporate   form   to   determine  whether   nominally   distinct\r\n\ncorporations are \"in truth . . . but divisions or departments  of\r\n\na 'single enterprise.'\"  NLRB v. Deena Artware, Inc., 361 US 398,\r                                                              \r\n\n402  (1960).   Note  that this  Court  has previously  upheld the\r\n\nBoard's finding of  an alter  ego \"where the  companies were  not\r\n\nsuccessors but  rather parallel  operations.\"   C.E.K. Industrial\r                                                                           \r\n\nMechanical Contractors, Inc. v.

Ahlborg  did not succeed  UBI\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ndoes not,  by itself, render the alter  ego doctrine inapplicable\r\n\nand Palmisciano's belief unreasonable.\r\n\n          Thus,  the  ALJ correctly  avoided turning  the hearing\r\n\ninto an inquiry into the agreement's ultimate meaning, since such\r\n\na decision  was beyond the  scope of  the only issue  before him:\r\n\nwhether or not to compel information disclosure.  With respect to\r\n\ntestimony  directed   at  this  question,  an  ALJ's  credibility\r\n\ndeterminations are entitled  to great weight because the  ALJ saw\r\n\nand heard the  witnesses testify.

(\"UBI\") seeks  review  of  the decision  of  the\r\n\nrespondent, the  National Labor  Relations Board (\"the  Board\" or\r\n\n\"the  NLRB\"), ordering  UBI  to supply  requested information  to\r\n\nDistrict Council 94, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners\r\n\nof America, AFL-CIO (the \"Union\").  The NLRB cross-applies, under\r\n\n   10(e)  of the  National Labor  Relations  Act (\"the  Act\"), 29\r\n\nU.S.C.   160(e),  for enforcement of its order against  UBI.  The\r\n\nBoard  has ordered  UBI  to cease  and  desist from  violating   \r\n\n8(a)(5) and (1)  of the Act, 29  U.S.C.    158(a)(1)  and (a)(5),\r\n\nfurnish the  Union with  the information  it requested,  and post\r\n\nappropriate notices.   For the  following reasons, we  affirm the\r\n\nBoard's Decision and Order.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In  1989, a  Rhode Island  company called O.  Ahlborg &amp;\r\n\nSons (\"O.  Ahlborg\") executed a three-year  collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement (\"CBA\")  with the Union.   On or about  March 24, 1992,\r\n\nO. Ahlborg notified  the Union that  it planned to  terminate the\r\n\nagreement as of  May 31,  1992, as was  O. Ahlborg's  contractual\r\n\nright.  As  a result  of collective bargaining  with the  Union's\r\n\nthen business manager (Herbert F. Holmes), O. Ahlborg  reached an\r\n\nagreement  (the  \"Holmes-Ahlborg   Agreement\")  with  the   Union\r\n\n(confirmed by a letter dated May 29, 1992) whereby a new employer\r\n\nentity,  UBI,   would  be  formed.     Under  the  Holmes-Ahlborg\r\n\nAgreement, UBI would enter into a collective bargaining agreement\r\n\n(the  \"new  CBA\") with  the Union  and  would continue  all union\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nbargaining unit work  performed at that time by  O. Ahlborg.  The\r\n\nBoard found that the Holmes-Ahlborg Agreement also provided that,\r\n\nas  between UBI  and  O.  Ahlborg,  UBI  would  be  allotted  all\r\n\nprevailing rate jobs.\r\n\n          Additionally, under the  Holmes-Ahlborg Agreement,  UBI\r\n\nwould  assume all employees currently performing union bargaining\r\n\nunit work for O. Ahlborg,  and there would be no  interruption in\r\n\nproduction,  employment or  wages  of union  members despite  the\r\n\ntermination of the O. Ahlborg-Union CBA.  Shortly thereafter, UBI\r\n\nand the Union entered into the new CBA, which provided that\r\n\n            [UBI]  will  not  subcontract   any  work\r\n            covered  by the  terms of  this agreement\r\n            which is  to be performed  at the jobsite\r\n            except  to  a  contractor  who  holds  an\r\n            agreement with the United  Brotherhood of\r\n            Carpenters and Joiners of America, or one\r\n            of  its  subordinate   bodies,  or,   who\r\n            agrees,  in writing, prior  to or  at the\r\n            time  of   the  execution  of   the  sub-\r\n            contract,  to be  bound  by the  terms of\r\n            this agreement.\r\n\nThe new CBA covered the period from June 1, 1992 to June 4, 1995.\r\n\n          On  December 8,  1993,  David F.  Palmisciano, who  had\r\n\nreplaced Holmes  as union business representative,  sent a letter\r\n\nto UBI's  chief executive  Eric Ahlborg, expressing  concern that\r\n\nUBI  was \"operating  a second  company\" as  \"an alter ego.\"   The\r\n\nletter  also requested that Eric  Ahlborg fill out  and return an\r\n\nenclosed  questionnaire.  Eric  Ahlborg refused  to reply  to the\r\n\nquestionnaire.\r\n\n          Subsequently,  the matter came before an administrative\r\n\nlaw  judge  (\"ALJ\")  on  the  NLRB  General  Counsel's  complaint\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nalleging that UBI  violated    8(a)(5) and 8(a)(1)  of the Act by\r\n\nrefusing  to  furnish  information  that the  Union  alleged  was\r\n\nnecessary  for, and relevant to, the performance of its duties as\r\n\nthe  exclusive  collective-bargaining   representative  of   unit\r\n\nemployees.   Palmisciano  testified  before an  ALJ that,  during\r\n\nthree previous onsite inspections,  he saw evidence that UBI  had\r\n\nviolated his interpretation of the Holmes-Ahlborg Agreement: that\r\n\nas  between O.  Ahlborg  and UBI,  UBI  would garner  all  state,\r\n\nFederal  and  other  work  with  high  wage  rates,  particularly\r\n\n\"prevailing  rates,\" and  that such  work would  all go  to union\r\n\ncarpenters.\r\n\n           The ALJ  concluded that the  Union reasonably believed\r\n\nthat  UBI  was  operating  O.  Ahlborg  as  an  \"alter  ego\"  and\r\n\nsubcontracting  in a  manner  that  violated  the  Holmes-Ahlborg\r\n\nAgreement's  award of prevailing rate  jobs to UBI  and its union\r\n\nmember  employees  only.1    Thus,  the ALJ  concluded  that  the\r\n\nUnion's reasonable belief justified the  request for information,\r\n\nand ordered UBI to comply.  The Board affirmed the ALJ's rulings,\r\n\nfindings and conclusions, and adopted his recommended Order.  UBI\r\n\nseeks review of the Board's decision, and the Board cross-applies\r\n\nfor enforcement of its order against UBI.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   UBI was organized  as a Rhode  Island corporation on  June 1,\r\n1992, to  engage  in the  business of  building construction  and\r\nrelated activities.   UBI's officers are related  to, and overlap\r\nsubstantially with,  those of  O. Ahlborg.    For example,  UBI's\r\nchief executive, Eric Ahlborg,  is the son of O.  Ahlborg's chief\r\nexecutive; UBI's vice president  is the daughter of  O. Ahlborg's\r\nchief executive; and UBI's chief financial officer, who holds the\r\nsame position at O. Ahlborg, is another son of O. Ahlborg's chief\r\nexecutive.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n                     II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                               II.

The record supports\r\n\nthe finding that Palmisciano reasonably believed that the purpose\r\n\nof the Holmes-Ahlborg Agreement  was to permit O. Ahlborg  to bid\r\n\nnonunion work and  to award  all \"prevailing rate\"  jobs to  UBI.\r\n\nFurthermore, the Union  had entered the new CBA with  UBI.  Thus,\r\n\nthe ALJ and the Board correctly concluded that the questionnaire,\r\n\nwith  its  inquiries into  UBI's ownership,  corporate directors,\r\n\nsuppliers  and  relationship  to  an  alleged nonunion  employer,\r\n\nsought   information   necessary   to  Palmisciano's   collective\r\n\nbargaining duties.\r\n\n          The ALJ  heard testimony from Palmisciano regarding the\r\n\nlatter's observations at three  different job sites.  Palmisciano\r\n\ntestified that at the three sites, all with O. Ahlborg as general\r\n\ncontractor  and paying prevailing rates, he had seen Union member\r\n\nUBI employees supervising nonunion employees doing unit work, and\r\n\nhe  had seen both Union member UBI employees and nonunion workers\r\n\ndoing  unit  work  for  subcontractors.   Additionally,  the  ALJ\r\n\nquestioned  Palmisciano regarding  the  meaning  of  the  Holmes-\r\n\nAhlborg Agreement,  especially with  respect to the  allotment of\r\n\nwork between O. Ahlborg and UBI.  Furthermore, the ALJ questioned\r\n\nPalmisciano  regarding O.  Ahlborg's  responses to  Palmisciano's\r\n\ndemands  that O.  Ahlborg use  union subcontractors  on carpentry\r\n\nwork at the three job sites.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          While UBI takes  offense at the  ALJ's refusal to  hear\r\n\nEric Ahlborg's testimony to  show that UBI and  O. Ahlborg had  a\r\n\ndifferent  understanding  of  the Holmes-Ahlborg  Agreement,  the\r\n\nissue  before  the  ALJ  was  whether  Palmisciano  could  supply\r\n\nobjective evidence  supporting a reasonable belief  that made his\r\n\ninformation request relevant to his collective bargaining duties.\r\n\nNaturally,  the  ALJ  drew  his conclusions  primarily  from  the\r\n\ntestimony  of Palmisciano, since  the chief issue  was whether or\r\n\nnot Palmisciano's beliefs were reasonable given objective facts.\r\n\n          UBI also argues that  because objective facts show that\r\n\nit is not operating an alter ego,  Palmisciano could not have had\r\n\na reasonable  belief that would render  the requested information\r\n\nrelevant.  The proposition that a union's information request may\r\n\nbe  denied if  the company  in question  can show  that objective\r\n\nfacts  render the  union's  concerns  untenable appears  logical.\r\n\nSee, e.g., San  Diego Newspaper Guild v.

However, in\r\n\nthe  instant  case,  the  issue  is  moot,  since  even  if  this\r\n\nproposition were  settled law applicable  here, UBI has  not made\r\n\nthe required showing.\r\n\n          In  the course of this argument, UBI relies on the fact\r\n\nthat  the relationship  between  it and  O.  Ahlborg is  not  the\r\n\nclassic alter ego  situation of \"a  disguised continuance of  the\r\n\nold  employer.\"  Therefore, runs the argument, because O.
