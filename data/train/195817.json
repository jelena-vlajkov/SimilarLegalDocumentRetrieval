The two  cases were later  consolidated.  On  August 28,\n\n1988, the  district court granted in part the government's motion\n\nfor  summary judgment,  finding Mottolo  and Service  jointly and\n\nseverally  responsible  for all  cleanup  costs  incurred by  the\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ngovernment at the dump site.

Summary  judgment is  appropriate when  \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and  admissions on file,\n\ntogether  with  the affidavits,  if any,  show  that there  is no\n\ngenuine issue as to  any material fact and that  the moving party\n\n                               -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nis entitled to  a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.

As to  issues on which\n\nthe nonmovant has the burden of proof, the movant need do no more\n\nthan  aver  \"an  absence of  evidence  to  support  the nonmoving\n\nparty's case.\"  Id. at 325.  The burden of production then shifts\r                            \n\nto  the nonmovant, who, to avoid summary judgment, must establish\n\nthe  existence of  at least  one question  of  fact that  is both\n\n\"genuine\" and  \"material.\"  See Anderson,  477 U.S. at 248.

In those  cases, the Court\n\nconstrued  the term  \"accident\"  in the  context of  \"occurrence\"\n\ncoverage to mean \"'an  undesigned contingency, . . .  a happening\n\nby  chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual,\n\nfortuitous, not anticipated, and  not naturally to be expected.'\"\n\nJespersen, 131 N.H. at  260 (quoting Vermont Mutual, 128  N.H. at\r                                                             \n\n523) (other  citations omitted).

Between  at  least  1975  and 1978\n            Richard  Mottolo  buried  more than  1650\n            drums   and   other  smaller   containers\n            containing  waste,   including  hazardous\n            substances, in the  southwest portion  of\n            the  Mottolo  site.   These  wastes  were\n            transported from K.J. Quinn and Co., Inc.\n            and   Lewis   Chemical  Corporation   and\n            disposed of at the Mottolo site.\n\n            11.  The drums and  other containers were\n            buried  in  an   area  in  the  southwest\n            portion  of  the  site  adjacent  to  the\n            intermittent stream.3   \n\n          Because   these   allegations    are   by    themselves\n\ninsufficient  to  determine  whether  there was  an  \"occurrence\"\n\nwithin  the  meaning  of  the  insurance  policies  --  or,  more\n\nprecisely, whether  Mottolo's acts were  so inherently  injurious\n\nthat some degree of  injury to property was certain to  result --\n\nwe look to the facts underlying the complaint.4\n\n          At all times relevant to this litigation, Mottolo owned\n\n65 acres of land on Blueberry Hill Road  (\"the site\") in Raymond,\n\nNew Hampshire.   In 1973,  Mottolo purchased  Service, a  company\n\nwhose primary  business involved  cleaning out drains  and grease\n\ntraps,  and pumping  out  septic tanks  and  cesspools.   Service\n                    \r                              \n\n3    The  State  of  New  Hampshire  made  essentially  the  same\nallegations in its Complaint.\n\n4  We  review those facts in the light  most favorable to Mottolo\nand Service.   See  Nereida-Gonz lez v. Tirado-Delgado,  990 F.2d\r                                                                \n701, 702 (1st Cir. 1993). \n\n                               -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ndisposed of waste accumulated  from these operations -- generally\n\nsand, grease, and sewage  -- by taking the waste to a contractor,\n\nor by discharging the  sewage into the city sewer  system through\n\nlicensed  spots.    In   1975  and  1977,  respectively,  Service\n\ncontracted  with K.J. Quinn  and Company (\"Quinn\")  and the Lewis\n\nChemical Corporation  (\"Lewis\") to pick  up and dispose  of waste\n\ngenerated  by those companies.  Mottolo picked up waste for Quinn\n\nand  Lewis until sometime in 1978, disposing approximately 200 to\n\n300 barrels of  waste from Lewis  and 1,200 to  1,300 barrels  of\n\nwaste from Quinn.\n\n          Mottolo or one of his  employees drove the Service dump\n\ntruck to  pick  up drums  and  barrels of  waste  at Quinn's  two\n\nfacilities  in Malden, Massachusetts and Seabrook, New Hampshire.\n\nMottolo  knew  Quinn  manufactured  shoe  polish  at  its  Malden\n\nfacility and  polyurethane at its Seabrook facility.  Mottolo was\n\ninformed at the Seabrook plant that Quinn \"had polyurethane which\n\nis very  thick -- it  looks like  wax.\"  Most  of the  containers\n\nusually  had  the  words  \"slop\"  or  \"waste\"  written  on  them.\n\nAlthough most  of the  drums  and barrels  Mottolo received  from\n\nQuinn were sealed, Mottolo occasionally  had to replace covers on\n\nthe containers  and  observed  that  they held  a  thick  \"goopy\"\n\nsubstance or \"water slop.\"  On one  occasion, Service picked up a\n\ncardboard container  from Quinn  which leaked a  \"rancid\" \"super,\n\nsuper strong\"  smelling liquid  onto the  pavement  at the  site.\n\nMottolo  made no attempt to  ascertain the contents  of the waste\n\ncontainers.\n\n                               -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Mottolo knew Lewis ran a solvent factory and knew  that\n\nthe  sludge  he  hauled  was  leftover  from  Lewis'  operations.\n\nMottolo's agreement with Lewis began when a Lewis official called\n\nMottolo and informed him that they had \"a lot of solvent and were\n\nlooking . .  . to get rid of  it.\"  Mottolo informed him  that he\n\nhad a dump, but that he did not have a permit.  They nevertheless\n\nagreed that Mottolo would  dispose of the containers.   The drums\n\nand barrels Mottolo picked up at  Lewis were always sealed and he\n\nnever saw what was in them when he picked them up.\n\n          Mottolo, or  one of his employees,  would transport the\n\ndrums and barrels  to the site on  Mottolo's truck and then  dump\n\nthem.   After ten to fifteen loads accumulated, George Frotten, a\n\nMottolo employee, would  bulldoze the containers in an attempt to\n\nlevel off the site.   Dirt was then placed over them.  During the\n\nbulldozing,  barrels and  drums would  be crushed  and flattened,\n\ncausing them to rupture  and spill their contents into  the soil.\n\nMottolo  knew that the containers broke during the bulldozing and\n\nthat  their contents would spill  into the soil.   Mottolo stated\n\nthat \"[w]hen a drum broke open, you would have reds or blues. . .\n\n.   It would look like shoe polish.\"   He stated that some of the\n\ncontents  would \"sit there and  mass.\"  Mottolo  once brought two\n\ntank  trucks of liquid waste from Quinn and pumped their contents\n\ndirectly into the dump site.\n\n          D.

Supp. at 664 (quoting  Morton, 134\r                                                                      \nN.J.  at 86).   Therefore,  \"'[a] general rule  in environmental-\npollution coverage litigation that  would permit intent to injure\nto  be presumed  simply on  the basis of  a knowing  discharge of\npollutants would be unjustified.'\"  Id.

Regardless of the merits of this  proposition, there is\nno basis in Vermont Mutual and its progeny for inferring that the\r                                    \nNew  Hampshire Supreme Court would adopt  it.  Rather, the law of\nNew Hampshire, as evolved from Vermont Mutual through Scanlon and\r                                                                       \nForeman,  is clear.    The Court  applies  an objective  test  to\r                 \ndetermine whether  the causation of injury was an \"accident\" and,\ntherefore, an \"occurrence\" for insurance coverage purposes. \n\n6  We note that the \"exceptional circumstances\"  standard applied\nby the district court was actually more favorable to Mottolo than\nNew Hampshire's objective, reasonable person standard.   \n\n                               -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nand its  progeny and  apply the Morton  standard.

Even a willful  breach of a  contract\r                \ncannot properly  be termed \"reprehensible\" conduct; certainly not\non  par  with  the  conduct  at issue  in  Vermont  Mutual.

The  discharge  of a  partner, by\r                   \nitself, is not \"reprehensible\" conduct.

Because\n\nthe  site is located adjacent  to an intermittent  stream, it was\n\nforeseeable  that whatever  was being  dumped would find  its way\n\ninto the waters of the stream.10  \n\n          Mottolo  argues, however, that  he did not  know he was\n\ndumping hazardous waste.   The  test under New  Hampshire law  is\n\nwhether a  reasonable person  under the circumstances  would have\n\nknown that he was dumping harmful substances.  See Jespersen, 131\r                                                                      \n\nN.H. at  260; Fisher, 131  N.H. at 773.   The facts  presented on\r                              \n\nsummary judgment,  viewed most  favorably  to Mottolo,  establish\n\nthat a reasonable person under the circumstances would have known\n\nthat he was dumping some form of hazardous substances, or, at the\n\nleast, that the  substances that were injurious to the  land.  As\n\nto this, there is no genuine factual dispute.\n\n          Mottolo was  in the  business of cleaning,  among other\n\nthings, cesspools  and grease traps, for  approximately two years\n\nprior to his contracting  with Quinn.  Mottolo disposed  of waste\n\naccumulated from those operations  -- generally sand, grease, and\n\n                    \r                              \n\n9   The hazardous  chemicals identified by  the EPA  at the  site\nincluded  acetone,  toluene,   trichlorethylene,  xylene,   butyl\nacetate,  methanol,  methylene  chloride,   methyl  methacrylate,\nmethyl ethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl ketone.\n\n10   Investigators  discovered  an upswelling  of groundwater  in\nseveral locations between the site and a creek downhill with odor\nand color consistent with those at the site.  \n\n                               -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nsewage -- by taking the waste to a contractor, or by  discharging\n\nthe sewage  into the  city sewer  system through  licensed spots.\n\nPrior to  his relationships with  Quinn and Lewis,  then, Mottolo\n\nhad  at  least some  rudimentary  knowledge of  how  the official\n\nsystem for disposing of waste operated.\n\n          Mottolo  knew   Quinn  manufactured  shoe   polish  and\n\npolyurethane  and that Lewis operated a solvent factory.  A Quinn\n\nemployee described  the polyurethane it needed  disposed as \"very\n\nthick  -- it  looks like  wax.\"   Mottolo's agreement  with Lewis\n\nbegan when a Lewis employee called him and said that Lewis had \"a\n\nlot of  solvent and were looking  . . . to  get rid of  it.\"  The\n\nLewis employee  asked Mottolo if  he \"had a  means to get  rid of\n\nsome solid stuff.\"  Mottolo told him that he had a dump, but that\n\nhe  did not have  a permit.  Apparently,  this was sufficient for\n\nLewis.  Lewis always paid Mottolo in cash, no invoices were used,\n\nand Lewis never wanted any receipts.  Lewis' clandestine behavior\n\nwould  suggest to a reasonable business person that something was\n\namiss, but Mottolo made  no attempt to ascertain the  identity of\n\nthe waste he was hauling.\n\n          Mottolo knew that the  containers were bulldozed at the\n\nsite, causing their  contents to spill out the soil.  He observed\n\ndrums leak  and burst at  the site and he  knew that some  of the\n\nwaste  that leaked  at  the site  consisted  of a  thick  \"goopy\"\n\nsubstance and  a \"rancid\" \"super, super  strong\" smelling liquid.\n\nMottolo  disposed of  approximately 1,650  drums and  other small\n\ncontainers of waste at the site over a three to four year period.\n\n                               -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          Based  on these facts, we think there can be no genuine\n\ndispute  that  a  reasonable  person  in  Mottolo's  shoes,  with\n\nMottolo's  experience,  would  have  known that  he  was  dumping\n\nsubstances  that were certain to cause \"some degree\" of injury to\n\nadjacent property.  \n\n                               -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          Mottolo  makes one  last stand,  however, arguing  that\n\nregardless of what  is known  today, a reasonable  person in  the\n\nmid-1970s  would not  have  believed that  dumping the  waste was\n\ninherently injurious.   We agree  that the proper  test looks  to\n\nwhat  a reasonable  person, at  the time,  would have  known with\n\nrespect  to  the injurious  nature of  his  acts.   The defendant\n\ninsurance companies have provided  evidence of the actual harmful\n\neffects of the  dumping on  the site and  nearby water  supplies.\n\nThe  defendants have  also provided,  as noted  above, sufficient\n\nevidence to  establish that a reasonable person  would have known\n\nthat he was dumping  hazardous materials.  This evidence  is more\n\nthan sufficient to shift  the burden to Mottolo to  establish the\n\nexistence  of a  genuine issue  of material  fact  concerning the\n\n\"state  of the  art\" (or,  more precisely,  the state  of general\n\nknowledge) with respect to hazardous waste in the mid-1970s.  See\r                                                                           \n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.  Ct. 2505, 91\r                                  \n\nL.Ed.2d 202 (1986).11  \n\n          Such evidence might  include expert affidavit testimony\n\nthat the state of scientific evidence was insufficient during the\n\nrelevant time  period and  that such  dumping was  not considered\n\n\"inherently injurious.\"   Mottolo has presented no  such evidence\n\n                    \r                              \n\n11  Because the underlying action against Mottolo by the EPA  and\nthe  State of New Hampshire  was initiated in  federal court, the\nburden shifting framework of New Hampshire's declaratory judgment\nact, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    491.22, does not apply.  See Town of\r                                                                           \nAllenstown,  et al.  v.

In   1975  and  1977,  respectively,  Service\n\ncontracted  with K.J. Quinn  and Company (\"Quinn\")  and the Lewis\n\nChemical Corporation  (\"Lewis\") to pick  up and dispose  of waste\n\ngenerated  by those companies.  Mottolo picked up waste for Quinn\n\nand  Lewis until sometime in 1978, disposing approximately 200 to\n\n300 barrels of  waste from Lewis  and 1,200 to  1,300 barrels  of\n\nwaste from Quinn.\n\n          Mottolo or one of his  employees drove the Service dump\n\ntruck to  pick  up drums  and  barrels of  waste  at Quinn's  two\n\nfacilities  in Malden, Massachusetts and Seabrook, New Hampshire.\n\nMottolo  knew  Quinn  manufactured  shoe  polish  at  its  Malden\n\nfacility and  polyurethane at its Seabrook facility.  Mottolo was\n\ninformed at the Seabrook plant that Quinn \"had polyurethane which\n\nis very  thick -- it  looks like  wax.\"  Most  of the  containers\n\nusually  had  the  words  \"slop\"  or  \"waste\"  written  on  them.\n\nAlthough most  of the  drums  and barrels  Mottolo received  from\n\nQuinn were sealed, Mottolo occasionally  had to replace covers on\n\nthe containers  and  observed  that  they held  a  thick  \"goopy\"\n\nsubstance or \"water slop.\"  On one  occasion, Service picked up a\n\ncardboard container  from Quinn  which leaked a  \"rancid\" \"super,\n\nsuper strong\"  smelling liquid  onto the  pavement  at the  site.\n\nMottolo  made no attempt to  ascertain the contents  of the waste\n\ncontainers.\n\n                               -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Mottolo knew Lewis ran a solvent factory and knew  that\n\nthe  sludge  he  hauled  was  leftover  from  Lewis'  operations.\n\nMottolo's agreement with Lewis began when a Lewis official called\n\nMottolo and informed him that they had \"a lot of solvent and were\n\nlooking . .  . to get rid of  it.\"  Mottolo informed him  that he\n\nhad a dump, but that he did not have a permit.  They nevertheless\n\nagreed that Mottolo would  dispose of the containers.   The drums\n\nand barrels Mottolo picked up at  Lewis were always sealed and he\n\nnever saw what was in them when he picked them up.\n\n          Mottolo, or  one of his employees,  would transport the\n\ndrums and barrels  to the site on  Mottolo's truck and then  dump\n\nthem.   After ten to fifteen loads accumulated, George Frotten, a\n\nMottolo employee, would  bulldoze the containers in an attempt to\n\nlevel off the site.   Dirt was then placed over them.  During the\n\nbulldozing,  barrels and  drums would  be crushed  and flattened,\n\ncausing them to rupture  and spill their contents into  the soil.\n\nMottolo  knew that the containers broke during the bulldozing and\n\nthat  their contents would spill  into the soil.   Mottolo stated\n\nthat \"[w]hen a drum broke open, you would have reds or blues. . .\n\n.   It would look like shoe polish.\"   He stated that some of the\n\ncontents  would \"sit there and  mass.\"  Mottolo  once brought two\n\ntank  trucks of liquid waste from Quinn and pumped their contents\n\ndirectly into the dump site.\n\n          D.

As\n\nto this, there is no genuine factual dispute.\n\n          Mottolo was  in the  business of cleaning,  among other\n\nthings, cesspools  and grease traps, for  approximately two years\n\nprior to his contracting  with Quinn.  Mottolo disposed  of waste\n\naccumulated from those operations  -- generally sand, grease, and\n\n                    \r                              \n\n9   The hazardous  chemicals identified by  the EPA  at the  site\nincluded  acetone,  toluene,   trichlorethylene,  xylene,   butyl\nacetate,  methanol,  methylene  chloride,   methyl  methacrylate,\nmethyl ethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl ketone.\n\n10   Investigators  discovered  an upswelling  of groundwater  in\nseveral locations between the site and a creek downhill with odor\nand color consistent with those at the site.  \n\n                               -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nsewage -- by taking the waste to a contractor, or by  discharging\n\nthe sewage  into the  city sewer  system through  licensed spots.\n\nPrior to  his relationships with  Quinn and Lewis,  then, Mottolo\n\nhad  at  least some  rudimentary  knowledge of  how  the official\n\nsystem for disposing of waste operated.\n\n          Mottolo  knew   Quinn  manufactured  shoe   polish  and\n\npolyurethane  and that Lewis operated a solvent factory.  A Quinn\n\nemployee described  the polyurethane it needed  disposed as \"very\n\nthick  -- it  looks like  wax.\"   Mottolo's agreement  with Lewis\n\nbegan when a Lewis employee called him and said that Lewis had \"a\n\nlot of  solvent and were looking  . . . to  get rid of  it.\"  The\n\nLewis employee  asked Mottolo if  he \"had a  means to get  rid of\n\nsome solid stuff.\"  Mottolo told him that he had a dump, but that\n\nhe  did not have  a permit.  Apparently,  this was sufficient for\n\nLewis.  Lewis always paid Mottolo in cash, no invoices were used,\n\nand Lewis never wanted any receipts.  Lewis' clandestine behavior\n\nwould  suggest to a reasonable business person that something was\n\namiss, but Mottolo made  no attempt to ascertain the  identity of\n\nthe waste he was hauling.\n\n          Mottolo knew that the  containers were bulldozed at the\n\nsite, causing their  contents to spill out the soil.  He observed\n\ndrums leak  and burst at  the site and he  knew that some  of the\n\nwaste  that leaked  at  the site  consisted  of a  thick  \"goopy\"\n\nsubstance and  a \"rancid\" \"super, super  strong\" smelling liquid.\n\nMottolo  disposed of  approximately 1,650  drums and  other small\n\ncontainers of waste at the site over a three to four year period.\n\n                               -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          Based  on these facts, we think there can be no genuine\n\ndispute  that  a  reasonable  person  in  Mottolo's  shoes,  with\n\nMottolo's  experience,  would  have  known that  he  was  dumping\n\nsubstances  that were certain to cause \"some degree\" of injury to\n\nadjacent property.  \n\n                               -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          Mottolo  makes one  last stand,  however, arguing  that\n\nregardless of what  is known  today, a reasonable  person in  the\n\nmid-1970s  would not  have  believed that  dumping the  waste was\n\ninherently injurious.   We agree  that the proper  test looks  to\n\nwhat  a reasonable  person, at  the time,  would have  known with\n\nrespect  to  the injurious  nature of  his  acts.   The defendant\n\ninsurance companies have provided  evidence of the actual harmful\n\neffects of the  dumping on  the site and  nearby water  supplies.\n\nThe  defendants have  also provided,  as noted  above, sufficient\n\nevidence to  establish that a reasonable person  would have known\n\nthat he was dumping  hazardous materials.  This evidence  is more\n\nthan sufficient to shift  the burden to Mottolo to  establish the\n\nexistence  of a  genuine issue  of material  fact  concerning the\n\n\"state  of the  art\" (or,  more precisely,  the state  of general\n\nknowledge) with respect to hazardous waste in the mid-1970s.
