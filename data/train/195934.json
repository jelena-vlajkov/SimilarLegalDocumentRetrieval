See  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nZannino,  895 F.2d 1, 17  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 494 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n1082  (1990).   We  address  only those  arguments  that have\n\narguably been preserved.3\n\n                          I.  FACTS\r                                      I.

As  collateral,\n\nExecutive assigned to Banco the accounts receivable generated\n\nby  its lease contracts.  Part of  the loan was to be used to\n\ndischarge Executive's debt to another bank.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Alerted by  Banco's brief  to their possible  waiver, the\nplaintiffs use their reply brief to \"set forth a succinct and\nveridic version of the facts . . . with limited references to\nthe documents which are  part of the record.\"   Arguments not\nmade in  the appellant's  opening brief, however,  are deemed\nwaived.  See, e.g., Sandstrom v. Chemlawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83,\r                                                           \n86  (1st Cir. 1990).  Moreover, the plaintiffs have not cured\nthe defects of their opening brief.  Although Banco's alleged\nloan agreement violations, use of \"disinformation,\" and other\nanti-competitive practices  may  be highly  relevant  to  the\nplaintiffs'  claims under  Puerto Rico  law, the  reply brief\nalso fails to  raise a  genuine issue of  material fact  with\nrespect to the BHCA claims.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          As  a  condition  for  the  loan,  Banco  allegedly\n\nprohibited Executive from financing its leasing business with\n\nany  other bank.   This  claimed exclusive  dealing condition\n\ndoes  not appear  in  the  loan  agreement.    In  fact,  the\n\nagreement has an integration clause that provides:\n\n          [This  agreement] constitutes  the entire\n          agreement among the  parties . . . .   No\n          covenant  or  condition not  expressed in\n          this   agreement   shall  affect   or  be\n          effective   to   interpret,   change   or\n          restrict  this  agreement.    No  change,\n          termination or attempted waiver  shall be\n          binding unless in writing.\n\n          The exclusive dealing  condition was allegedly part\n\nof Banco's scheme to  drive Executive out of business  and to\n\ntake  over its vehicle  leasing operation for  the benefit of\n\nBanco's  corporate affiliate,  Velco,  which happened  to  be\n\nExecutive's main  competitor.   To that end,  Banco allegedly\n\nstructured Executive's  line of credit to  create an inherent\n\nliquidity  shortage;  made  premature  and  improper  charges\n\nagainst Executive's account; and improperly refused to extend\n\nnew credit to Executive when it was not in default.\n\n          Executive  eventually  fell   behind  in  its  loan\n\npayments.    In  December,   1987,  Banco  called  the  loan.\n\nPlaintiffs claim that it did so without  granting Executive a\n\nmeaningful  opportunity to  obtain alternative  financing, or\n\nplacing Executive on default  status as required by  the loan\n\nagreement.   In March, 1988, the parties entered an agreement\n\nto  terminate  the  loan  agreement.    Executive  agreed  to\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ntransfer  its main assets and  all of its  lease contracts --\n\neven  those in  which Banco  had no  previous interest  -- to\n\nBanco, allegedly for the benefit of Velco.\n\n          The  plaintiffs claim  that under the  Bank Holding\n\nCompany Act,  both the  initial loan  agreement and  the 1988\n\ntermination agreement  were extensions of  credit conditioned\n\nupon a prohibited tying arrangement.\n\n                       II.

The loan agreement\n\n          The plaintiffs  argue that Banco  violated the BHCA\n\nby  extending credit to  Executive on condition  that it \"not\n\nobtain  some  other  credit,  property,  or  service  from  a\n\ncompetitor of  such bank . .  . .\"  12  U.S.C.   1972(1)(E).4\n\nBecause no such restriction  appears in the agreement itself,\n\nand the  loan agreement, by its  clear language, \"constitutes\n\nthe entire  agreement among the parties,\"  the district court\n\nrejected the plaintiffs' extrinsic evidence of the  exclusive\n\ndealing condition, including their own sworn affidavits.  See\r                                                                         \n\nExecutive Leasing, 1994  WL 448985, at  *7 (citing P.R.

Laws Ann. tit. 31,   3471:\n\n            If the  terms of a  contract are  clear\n          and leave  no doubt as to  the intentions\n          of the contracting  parties, the  literal\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          sense  of  its   stipulations  shall   be\n          observed.\n\n            If  the words should appear contrary to\n          the evident intention of  the contracting\n          parties, the intention shall prevail.\n\nRelying  exclusively  on  the  second  sentence  quoted,  the\n\nplaintiffs argue that the words of the integration clause are\n\nin fact \"contrary to the evident intention of the contracting\n\nparties.\"  Yet to consider the extrinsic evidence at all, the\n\ncourt  must first  find the relevant  terms of  the agreement\n\nunclear.  That requirement not  being met, the district court\n\ncorrectly  went no  further.

This argument is made only\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  The plaintiffs  cite several civil law  treatises for the\nproposition that  the correct methodology for determining the\nintention of  contracting parties  is \"to consider,  not only\nthe  written contract  itself, but  all other  evidence which\nwould  otherwise be  admissible.\"   The admissibility  of the\n\"other evidence\"  under Puerto Rico law,  however, depends in\nthe first instance  on the clarity  of the written  contract.\nSee Vulcan Tools, 23 F.3d  at 567-68; Mercado-Garcia v. Ponce\r                                                                         \nFed.  Bank, 979  F.2d 890,  894 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (where both\r                      \nparties  offered extrinsic  evidence contradicting  the clear\nterms of  a promissory note,  court is nonetheless  \"bound to\nlook no further than the note itself\").\n\n    We note, too, that  the plaintiffs' extrinsic evidence of\nthe actual  practice of  the parties would  not have  blocked\nsummary  judgment on their    1972(1)(E) claim.  For example,\nBanco tolerated Executive's repeated overdrafts and delays in\npayment, even though the loan agreement required Executive to\npay  on time.  The  practice of permitting  late payments and\noverdrafts  strikes  us  as  a  reasonable  accommodation  to\nExecutive;  it  raises  no  genuine  question  regarding  the\nintegration of the agreement.   As for Banco's  other alleged\ndeviations from  the loan  agreement, the integration  clause\nprovides that  \"no change .  . .  shall be binding  unless in\r                                                              \nwriting\" (emphasis added).  This is not a representation that\nthere would  never be any  variance, however small,  from the\nagreement.  With respect to  terms that the parties  intended\nto  be  binding  and  enforceable,  nothing  plaintiffs  have\narticulated  on appeal  leads  us  to  doubt  that  the  loan\nagreement should \"be deemed  as complete\" under Puerto Rico's\nparol  evidence rule.   P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 32,  App. IV, R.\n69(B).   In  fact,  on several  occasions when  Banco renewed\nExecutive's line of credit or adjusted the terms of the loan,\nit did so in writing as required by the loan agreement.\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nby the attempted incorporation  of a surreply filed  with the\r                                                         \n\ndistrict  court; accordingly, it  has been waived.   In their\n\noriginal  complaint,   the  plaintiffs  made   no  allegation\n\nregarding exclusive dealing, let alone fraud.  Fraud was  not\n\nalleged in  the amended complaint,  or even in  the tendered,\n\nbut rejected, second amended complaint.\n\n          Even were  we to reach the  argument of illegality,\n\nwe  would reject it on the merits.  The plaintiffs' extrinsic\n\nevidence  was offered  not  to illuminate  (for example)  the\n\ncircumstances  under which  the  agreement was  made, see  R.\r                                                                     \n\n69(B),  but to contravene  an express term  of the agreement.\n\nThe plaintiffs  have cited no  authority to suggest  that the\n\nillegality  exception to  Puerto Rico's  parol evidence  rule\n\nsweeps this far.   The district court  correctly excluded any\n\nevidence of the exclusive dealing condition.\n\n          B.  The termination agreement\r                      B.  The termination agreement\n\n          Under  the  BHCA,  banks  may  not  require,  as  a\n\ncondition  for extending  credit, that \"the  customer provide\n\nsome  additional  credit,  property,  or service  to  a  bank\n\nholding company of such  bank, or to any other  subsidiary of\n\nsuch bank holding  company.\"   12 U.S.C.    1972(1)(D).   The\n\nplaintiffs allege that Banco violated   1972(1)(D) by forcing\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nExecutive to surrender its  vehicle leasing business to Banco\n\nfor the benefit of its leasing affiliate, Velco.6\n\n          The plaintiffs  make only a  cursory argument  that\n\nExecutive was in fact  required to provide \"additional .  . .\n\nproperty\" (as opposed to the  collateral for the loan) within\n\nthe meaning of the  BHCA.  For a \"detailed exposition  of the\n\nfacts\" and the plaintiffs' legal theories, we are directed to\n\ntheir pleadings below.  We rule that the plaintiffs' argument\n\nunder   1972(1)(D) has been waived.7\n\n          We  turn now  to  two claims  of procedural  error,\n\nwhich we  assess in light of  their effect (if any)  upon the\n\nsummary judgment proceedings.\n\n          C.  The second amended complaint\r                      C.  The second amended complaint\n\n          The plaintiffs argue that the district court abused\n\nits discretion by denying them leave to file a second amended\n\ncomplaint.   On January  18, 1994,  the district court  heard\n\narguments on the need for a stay of discovery pending Banco's\n\nmotion  for  summary  judgment  on  the  BHCA  claims.    The\n\nplaintiffs gave no hint  that a second amended  complaint was\n\nin the offing.  By  order of the court, Banco was to move for\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.  Banco  incorrectly  asserts  that  the  plaintiffs  never\ninvoked    1972(1)(D)  before the district  court.   In fact,\nreferences  to  that   section  appear  in  the   plaintiffs'\nopposition to summary judgment.\n\n7.  We  therefore need not decide whether  the workout of the\nloan  constituted  an  \"exten[sion  of]  credit\"  within  the\nmeaning of the BHCA.\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nsummary  judgment  by February  7,  1994, and  the  trial was\n\nscheduled  for  April 18,  1994.   On  February 1,  1994, the\n\nplaintiffs  unexpectedly moved  for  leave to  file a  second\n\namended  complaint.   The  motion remained  pending when  the\n\ndistrict court entered summary judgment for Banco.\n\n          Rule 15(a) of the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nprovides  in part  that leave  to amend  pleadings  \"shall be\n\nfreely given when justice so requires.\"   Absent factors such\n\nas  undue  delay,  bad  faith or  dilatory  motive,  repeated\n\nfailure to  cure deficiencies by  previous amendments,  undue\n\nprejudice to the opposing  party, or \"futility of amendment,\"\n\nthe leave sought should be granted.

Davis, 371 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n178, 182 (1962).\n\n          We are  confident that  the district court  did not\n\nabuse its  \"considerable discretion\" by  implicitly rejecting\n\nthe  second amended  complaint.

This was  the second\r                 \n\ntime  that  the  plaintiffs  had  attempted  to  amend  their\n\ncomplaint  to  forestall  a   dispositive  motion  (in   this\n\ninstance, Banco's summary judgment motion).  The first motion\n\nfor  leave  to  file  an amended  complaint  came  after  the\r                                                                    \n\noriginal  complaint  was dismissed.

To that end, Banco allegedly structured Executive's line of credit to create an inherent liquidity shortage;  made premature and improper charges against Executive's account;  and improperly refused to extend new credit to Executive when it was not in default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Executive eventually fell behind in its loan payments.  In December, 1987, Banco called the loan.  Plaintiffs claim that it did so without granting Executive a meaningful opportunity to obtain alternative financing, or placing Executive on default status as required by the loan agreement.  In March, 1988, the parties entered an agreement to terminate the loan agreement.  Executive agreed to transfer its main assets and all of its lease contracts--even those in which Banco had no previous interest--to Banco, allegedly for the benefit of Velco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs claim that under the Bank Holding Company Act, both the initial loan agreement and the 1988 termination agreement were extensions of credit conditioned upon a prohibited tying arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The loan agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that Banco violated the BHCA by extending credit to Executive on condition that it \"not obtain some other credit, property, or service from a competitor of such bank....\"  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1972(1)(E).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Because no such restriction appears in the agreement itself, and the loan agreement, by its clear language, \"constitutes the entire agreement among the parties,\" the district court rejected the plaintiffs' extrinsic evidence of the exclusive dealing condition, including their own sworn affidavits.  See Executive Leasing, 1994 WL 448985, at * 7 (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App.  IV, R. 69(B) (1983) (Parol Evidence Rule) (evidence extrinsic to an oral or written agreement is inadmissible where \"all the terms and conditions constituting the true and final intention of the parties have been included\");  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 3471 (1991) (Article 1233 of the Civil Code) (\"If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed....\");  Vulcan Tools of Puerto Rico v. Makita USA, Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 567 (1st Cir.1994) (applying Puerto Rico law;  \"[w]hen an agreement leaves no doubt as to the intent of the parties, a court should not look beyond the literal terms of the contract.\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, an agreement is \"clear\" when it can \" 'be understood in one sense alone, without leaving any room for doubt, controversies or difference of interpretation....' \"  Catullo v. Metzner, 834 F.2d 1075, 1079 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting Heirs of Ramirez v. Superior Court, 81 P.R.R. 347, 351 (1959)).  The plaintiffs concede that the loan agreement is clear.  They argue, however, that the written agreement was not in fact the entire agreement, and that we must consider extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent with respect to integration.  This argument is supported by a selective reading of Article 1233 of Puerto Rico's Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 3471:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the words should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the intention shall prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying exclusively on the second sentence quoted, the plaintiffs argue that the words of the integration clause are in fact \"contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties.\"   Yet to consider the extrinsic evidence at all, the court must first find the relevant terms of the agreement unclear.  That requirement not being met, the district court correctly went no further.  See Vulcan, 23 F.3d at 564 (because the contractual term \"non-exclusive\" is clear and unambiguous, there is \"no need to dwell on\" extrinsic evidence of the supplier's alleged promise to limit the number of its distributors);  Ballester Hermanos, Inc. v. Campbell Soup Co., 797 F.Supp. 103, 108 n. 4 (D.P.R.1992) (under Puerto Rico's Civil Code and parol evidence rule, parties may resort to extrinsic evidence of circumstances surrounding the document \"to assist in the interpretation of an apparent conflict in the written text\") (emphasis added);  Nike Int'l Ltd. v. Athletic Sales, Inc., 689 F.Supp. 1235 (D.P.R.1988) (under Article 1233 of the Civil Code, intent of the parties \"is to be gleaned first from the literal terms of the contract and then, if necessary, from the circumstances surrounding its execution\") (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs attempt to distinguish our decision in Vulcan Tools, 23 F.3d at 567-68, where we excluded extrinsic evidence that was offered to vary a clear and unambiguous term of the contract, on the ground that fraud and illegality were not alleged.  This argument is made only by the attempted incorporation of a surreply filed with the district court;  accordingly, it has been waived.  In their original complaint, the plaintiffs made no allegation regarding exclusive dealing, let alone fraud.  Fraud was not alleged in the amended complaint, or even in the tendered, but rejected, second amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to reach the argument of illegality, we would reject it on the merits.  The plaintiffs' extrinsic evidence was offered not to illuminate (for example) the circumstances under which the agreement was made, see R. 69(B), but to contravene an express term of the agreement.  The plaintiffs have cited no authority to suggest that the illegality exception to Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule sweeps this far.  The district court correctly excluded any evidence of the exclusive dealing condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The termination agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the BHCA, banks may not require, as a condition for extending credit, that \"the customer provide some additional credit, property, or service to a bank holding company of such bank, or to any other subsidiary of such bank holding company.\"  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1972(1)(D).  The plaintiffs allege that Banco violated Sec. 1972(1)(D) by forcing Executive to surrender its vehicle leasing business to Banco for the benefit of its leasing affiliate, Velco.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs make only a cursory argument that Executive was in fact required to provide \"additional ... property\" (as opposed to the collateral for the loan) within the meaning of the BHCA.  For a \"detailed exposition of the facts\" and the plaintiffs' legal theories, we are directed to their pleadings below.  We rule that the plaintiffs' argument under Sec. 1972(1)(D) has been waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to two claims of procedural error, which we assess in light of their effect (if any) upon the summary judgment proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The second amended complaint</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion by denying them leave to file a second amended complaint.  On January 18, 1994, the district court heard arguments on the need for a stay of discovery pending Banco's motion for summary judgment on the BHCA claims.  The plaintiffs gave no hint that a second amended complaint was in the offing.  By order of the court, Banco was to move for summary judgment by February 7, 1994, and the trial was scheduled for April 18, 1994.  On February 1, 1994, the plaintiffs unexpectedly moved for leave to file a second amended complaint.  The motion remained pending when the district court entered summary judgment for Banco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part that leave to amend pleadings \"shall be freely given when justice so requires.\"   Absent factors such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments, undue prejudice to the opposing party, or \"futility of amendment,\" the leave sought should be granted.  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are confident that the district court did not abuse its \"considerable discretion\" by implicitly rejecting the second amended complaint.  Rodriguez v. Banco Central Corp., 990 F.2d 7, 14 (1st Cir.1993).  This was the second time that the plaintiffs had attempted to amend their complaint to forestall a dispositive motion (in this instance, Banco's summary judgment motion).  The first motion for leave to file an amended complaint came after the original complaint was dismissed.  Moreover, after nearly five years of litigation and a prior amendment of the complaint, and with the trial less than three months away, the plaintiffs made allegations for the first time against Banco Popular, the successor-in-interest to defendant Banco de Ponce, based on conduct that took place after the termination of the loan agreement--conduct that \"has continued to this date.\"  \"The further along a case is toward trial, the greater the threat of prejudice and delay when new claims are belatedly added.\"  Rodriguez, 990 F.2d at 14.   Although the district court should have \"state[d] explicitly its reasons for den[ying]\" leave to amend, Kay v. New Hampshire Democratic Party, 821 F.2d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir.1987), this reason for the denial is plain from the procedural history of the case:  the plaintiffs were trying to prolong discovery and postpone a ruling on the summary judgment motion in the hope that \"something concrete will eventually materialize....\"  Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., 1 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tendered complaint would have been futile in any event because it could not have blocked summary judgment on the jurisdictional BHCA claims.  See Kay, 821 F.2d at 34 (\"for the sole reason that [the proposed] amendment would have been futile, it was properly denied\") (citing Foman, 371 U.S. at 182, 83 S.Ct. at 230).   On appeal, the plaintiffs point to no particular amendment that might with appropriate discovery have raised a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we reject the argument that the plaintiffs should have been allowed to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The stay of discovery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion by staying discovery during the summary judgment proceedings, and by denying their Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) motion for additional discovery.  This argument has not been adequately developed on appeal and must be deemed waived.  See, e.g., Plaintiffs' Brief at 26 (\"Executive also showed, with great particularity, where discovery stood at the time.  [That discussion is incorporated by reference[.] ...]\") (citing two district court pleadings).  We have searched the plaintiffs' brief in vain for a showing that their discovery requests, whether those pending at the time of the stay or those made pursuant to Rule 56(f), were necessary or even relevant to their opposition to summary judgment on the BHCA claims.  Again, the plaintiffs fail to address the specific manner in which they were allegedly prejudiced by the claimed error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Double costs are assessed against plaintiffs' attorneys pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 38. and 28 U.S.C.

Executive respectfully directs the attention of this Court to the relevant materials, and incorporates them by reference.\")  (there follows a citation to forty pages of the plaintiffs' brief in opposition to summary judgment).  The brief is littered with many more examples of implicit incorporation in lieu of factual and legal argument.

See, e.g., Sandstrom v. Chemlawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir.1990).  Moreover, the plaintiffs have not cured the defects of their opening brief.  Although Banco's alleged loan agreement violations, use of \"disinformation,\" and other anti-competitive practices may be highly relevant to the plaintiffs' claims under Puerto Rico law, the reply brief also fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the BHCA claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Under 12 U.S.C.

See Vulcan Tools, 23 F.3d at 567-68;  Mercado-Garcia v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, 979 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir.1992) (where both parties offered extrinsic evidence contradicting the clear terms of a promissory note, court is nonetheless \"bound to look no further than the note itself\")</p>\n        <p>We note, too, that the plaintiffs' extrinsic evidence of the actual practice of the parties would not have blocked summary judgment on their Sec. 1972(1)(E) claim.  For example, Banco tolerated Executive's repeated overdrafts and delays in payment, even though the loan agreement required Executive to pay on time.  The practice of permitting late payments and overdrafts strikes us as a reasonable accommodation to Executive;  it raises no genuine question regarding the integration of the agreement.  As for Banco's other alleged deviations from the loan agreement, the integration clause provides that \"no change ... shall be binding unless in writing\" (emphasis added).  This is not a representation that there would never be any variance, however small, from the agreement.  With respect to terms that the parties intended to be binding and enforceable, nothing plaintiffs have articulated on appeal leads us to doubt that the loan agreement should \"be deemed as complete\" under Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App.  IV, R. 69(B).  In fact, on several occasions when Banco renewed Executive's line of credit or adjusted the terms of the loan, it did so in writing as required by the loan agreement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Banco incorrectly asserts that the plaintiffs never invoked Sec. 1972(1)(D) before the district court.

As collateral, Executive assigned to Banco the accounts receivable generated by its lease contracts.

This claimed exclusive dealing condition does not appear in the loan agreement.  In fact, the agreement has an integration clause that provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[This agreement] constitutes the entire agreement among the parties....

To that end, Banco allegedly structured Executive's line of credit to create an inherent liquidity shortage;  made premature and improper charges against Executive's account;  and improperly refused to extend new credit to Executive when it was not in default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Executive eventually fell behind in its loan payments.  In December, 1987, Banco called the loan.  Plaintiffs claim that it did so without granting Executive a meaningful opportunity to obtain alternative financing, or placing Executive on default status as required by the loan agreement.  In March, 1988, the parties entered an agreement to terminate the loan agreement.  Executive agreed to transfer its main assets and all of its lease contracts--even those in which Banco had no previous interest--to Banco, allegedly for the benefit of Velco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs claim that under the Bank Holding Company Act, both the initial loan agreement and the 1988 termination agreement were extensions of credit conditioned upon a prohibited tying arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

The plaintiffs concede that the loan agreement is clear.  They argue, however, that the written agreement was not in fact the entire agreement, and that we must consider extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent with respect to integration.  This argument is supported by a selective reading of Article 1233 of Puerto Rico's Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 3471:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the words should appear contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the intention shall prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying exclusively on the second sentence quoted, the plaintiffs argue that the words of the integration clause are in fact \"contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties.\"   Yet to consider the extrinsic evidence at all, the court must first find the relevant terms of the agreement unclear.

The plaintiffs' extrinsic evidence was offered not to illuminate (for example) the circumstances under which the agreement was made, see R. 69(B), but to contravene an express term of the agreement.  The plaintiffs have cited no authority to suggest that the illegality exception to Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule sweeps this far.

On January 18, 1994, the district court heard arguments on the need for a stay of discovery pending Banco's motion for summary judgment on the BHCA claims.  The plaintiffs gave no hint that a second amended complaint was in the offing.  By order of the court, Banco was to move for summary judgment by February 7, 1994, and the trial was scheduled for April 18, 1994.  On February 1, 1994, the plaintiffs unexpectedly moved for leave to file a second amended complaint.

This was the second time that the plaintiffs had attempted to amend their complaint to forestall a dispositive motion (in this instance, Banco's summary judgment motion).  The first motion for leave to file an amended complaint came after the original complaint was dismissed.  Moreover, after nearly five years of litigation and a prior amendment of the complaint, and with the trial less than three months away, the plaintiffs made allegations for the first time against Banco Popular, the successor-in-interest to defendant Banco de Ponce, based on conduct that took place after the termination of the loan agreement--conduct that \"has continued to this date.\"  \"The further along a case is toward trial, the greater the threat of prejudice and delay when new claims are belatedly added.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603795\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rodriguez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/603795/raul-f-rodriguez-v-banco-central-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>.

See, e.g., Plaintiffs' Brief at 26 (\"Executive also showed, with great particularity, where discovery stood at the time.  [That discussion is incorporated by reference[.] ...]\") (citing two district court pleadings).  We have searched the plaintiffs' brief in vain for a showing that their discovery requests, whether those pending at the time of the stay or those made pursuant to Rule 56(f), were necessary or even relevant to their opposition to summary judgment on the BHCA claims.

Moreover, the plaintiffs have not cured the defects of their opening brief.  Although Banco's alleged loan agreement violations, use of \"disinformation,\" and other anti-competitive practices may be highly relevant to the plaintiffs' claims under Puerto Rico law, the reply brief also fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the BHCA claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Under 12 U.S.C.

For example, Banco tolerated Executive's repeated overdrafts and delays in payment, even though the loan agreement required Executive to pay on time.  The practice of permitting late payments and overdrafts strikes us as a reasonable accommodation to Executive;  it raises no genuine question regarding the integration of the agreement.  As for Banco's other alleged deviations from the loan agreement, the integration clause provides that \"no change ... shall be binding unless in writing\" (emphasis added).  This is not a representation that there would never be any variance, however small, from the agreement.  With respect to terms that the parties intended to be binding and enforceable, nothing plaintiffs have articulated on appeal leads us to doubt that the loan agreement should \"be deemed as complete\" under Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App.  IV, R. 69(B).
