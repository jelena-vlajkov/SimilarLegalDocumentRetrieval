Plaintiff  Dela, Inc.,  a  Massachusetts\r                            \n\ncompany  engaged  in  the  business  of  laminating  fabrics,\n\nsuffered  nearly $80,000  in  damages when  its building  was\n\nflooded  on  March 17,  1990.   When  its  insurance carrier,\n\ndefendant  CNA Insurance  Co., disclaimed  coverage  for such\n\nlosses,  plaintiff brought  the instant  declaratory judgment\n\naction.  That suit  was filed on April 17,  1992, twenty-nine\n\ndays  after  the  expiration  of the  applicable  limitations\n\nperiod  on March 19, 1992.   The district  court proceeded to\n\naward summary judgment for  defendant on the ground  that the\n\naction  was time-barred.   The  sole issue  now on  appeal is\n\nwhether defendant should be  equitably estopped from  relying\n\non the limitations defense.\n\n     Under  Massachusetts   law,  which  we  apply   in  this\n\ndiversity action, the doctrine  of equitable estoppel is well\n\nestablished.  Inasmuch as the doctrine is designed to prevent\n\nresults  \"contrary  to  good  conscience  and  fair dealing,\"\n\nMcLearn v. Hill,  276 Mass.  519, 524 (1931),  there are  \"no\r                           \n\nrigid   criteria\"  governing   its  application,   Libman  v.\r                                                                     \n\nZuckerman,  33  Mass. App.  Ct.  341,  346  (1992).   Broadly\r                     \n\nstated, estoppel seeks to prevent  a person \"from denying the\n\nconsequences of his conduct where that conduct has been  such\n\nas to induce another to change his position in  good faith or\n\nsuch   that   a   reasonable   man  would   rely   upon   the\n\nrepresentations made.\"   Bergeron v. Mansour, 152 F.2d 27, 30\r                                                        \r\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1945) (applying Massachusetts law).  In the statute\n\nof limitations context, the doctrine requires proof \"that the\n\ndefendants  made representations  they  knew or  should  have\n\nknown  would induce the plaintiffs to put off bringing a suit\n\nand that the  plaintiffs did in fact delay in reliance on the\n\nrepresentations.\"   White v.  Peabody Constr. Co.,  386 Mass.\r                                                             \n\n121, 134 (1982);  accord, e.g., Whitcomb v. Pension Dev. Co.,\r                                                                        \n\n808  F.2d 167,  172 (1st  Cir. 1986)  (applying Massachusetts\n\nlaw).  It is unnecessary that defendant intentionally mislead\n\nor deceive  the plaintiff,  see, e.g., MacKeen  v. Kasinskas,\r                                                                        \n\n333 Mass. 695, 698  (1956), or even that defendant  intend by\n\nits  conduct to induce delay, see,  e.g., LaBonte v. NY, NH &amp;\r                                                                         \n\nHart. R.R., 341  Mass. 127, 131  (1960) (\"one is  responsible\r                      \n\nfor the word or act which he knows, or ought to know, will be\r                                                                \n\nacted  upon  by  another\")  (emphasis added);  accord,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nClauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 663 n.3 (1st Cir.  1987).  It\r                            \n\nis  necessary, however,  that  \"[t]he reliance  of the  party\n\nseeking   the  benefit  of  estoppel  [be]  ...  reasonable.\"\n\nO'Blenes  v.  Zoning Board  of  Appeals, 397  Mass.  555, 558\r                                                   \n\n(1986).\n\n     In  seeking  to  invoke this  doctrine  here,  plaintiff\n\npoints  to communications  between  the  parties'  attorneys,\n\nparticularly to  a  telephone conversation  that occurred  on\n\nJanuary  27,   1992.    In  an   affidavit  submitted  below,\n\nplaintiff's  trial  counsel   (John  James)  described   that\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nconversation  with  defendant's   counsel  (Frank  Toto)   as\n\nfollows.    The attorneys  there  discussed  the  need for  a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action  in the event the  matter was not\n\nsettled.  James said he had been authorized to bring suit but\n\nwould  await  defendant's  response to  a  pending settlement\n\ndemand.  When  asked if  defendant intended to  file suit  to\n\nresolve the coverage issue,  Toto \"unequivocally\" stated that\n\n\"if the matter did not settle CNA would be bringing an action\n\nfor  declaratory  judgment.\"   James  replied  that he  would\n\naccept service of process on behalf of his client and that he\n\n\"would not  file the action in  anticipation of [defendant's]\n\nfiling  suit.\"   (Attached  to  the  affidavit was  a  letter\n\nwritten by Toto  to James three  days later, which  mentioned\n\nthat \"[i]n  our last conversation,  ... you agreed  to accept\n\nservice  of any  declaratory judgment  action CNA  might file\n\nover the coverage issue.\")   In his affidavit, James  went on\n\nto explain that he had  believed, based on this  conversation\n\nand his amicable relationship with Toto, that defendant would\n\nbe  filing suit; that he had relied  on this agreement in not\n\nbringing  suit himself;  and  that he  immediately filed  the\n\naction when it  became apparent that defendant  was not going\n\nto do so.\n\n     On  appeal, defendant contends  that James'  reliance on\n\nToto's   promise   was   unreasonable   in   light   of   the\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n\"clarification\"  that  appeared  in  the  latter's  follow-up\n\nletter.1    In   its  view,  the  reference  there   to  \"any\n\ndeclaratory judgment  action that CNA  might file\"  (emphasis\r                                                        \n\nadded) was  sufficient  to  call  into  question  defendant's\n\nintentions in this regard.   A more plausible interpretation,\n\nwe think, is that Toto's choice of language  simply reflected\n\nthe  possibility  that the  case  would  be  settled  in  the\n\ninterim.   We find nothing in his letter that would seriously\n\nundercut an \"unequivocal\" promise voiced three days earlier.\n\n     We nonetheless  agree that plaintiff's  reliance on that\n\nrepresentation was unreasonable as a matter of law.  From all\n\nthat appears, Toto conveyed this pledge in a single telephone\n\nconversation,  at  a time  when  nearly  two months  remained\n\nbefore the limitations period  expired.  The follow-up letter\n\ncontained no explicit  confirmation thereof,  and the  matter\n\nwas never addressed again.  Most important, plaintiff took no\n\nsteps thereafter  to ascertain whether defendant  had in fact\n\nfulfilled  its  promise.   This  last  factor proves  largely\n\ndispositive.   \n\n     The instant  case is unusual in  that the representation\n\nat issue--a  promise to  file suit--concerned an  action that\n\nwas  to  be  performed  before  the  statute  of  limitations\r                                          \n\nexpired, not afterwards.  Plaintiff was thus in a position to\r                                   \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Defendant offered no response below to James' affidavit--\nperhaps because its summary judgment motion was granted eight\ndays after that affidavit was filed.\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nconfirm, prior to the March 19, 1992 deadline, that defendant\n\nhad followed through on its  pledge.  Yet no such  steps were\n\ntaken.  As that date approached, with no notice of any filing\n\nhaving  been  received,  plaintiff  failed even  to  place  a\n\ntelephone  call to ascertain the status of events.  No matter\n\nhow \"unequivocal\"  Toto's statement  had been, and  no matter\n\nhow cordial  the attorneys'  relationship was, we  think that\n\nsuch a  lack of  diligence precluded invocation  of equitable\n\nestoppel as a matter of law.  See,  e.g., O'Blenes, 397 Mass.\r                                                              \n\nat 558-59 (holding that  it was unreasonable for  attorney to\n\nrely on statement  by zoning  board clerk as  to when  appeal\n\nperiod expired; attorney \"had an obligation to determine\" the\n\nrelevant facts); cf.

Broadly stated, estoppel seeks to prevent a person \"from denying the consequences of his conduct where that conduct has been such as to induce another to change his position in good faith or such that a reasonable man would rely upon the representations made.\"  Bergeron v. Mansour, 152 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1945) (applying Massachusetts law).

When its insurance carrier, defendant CNA Insurance Co., disclaimed coverage for such losses, plaintiff brought the instant declaratory judgment action.  That suit was filed on April 17, 1992, twenty-nine days after the expiration of the applicable limitations period on March 19, 1992.  The district court proceeded to award summary judgment for defendant on the ground that the action was time-barred.  The sole issue now on appeal is whether defendant should be equitably estopped from relying on the limitations defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, which we apply in this diversity action, the doctrine of equitable estoppel is well established.  Inasmuch as the doctrine is designed to prevent results \"contrary to good conscience and fair dealing,\" McLearn v. Hill, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></span>, 524 (1931), there are \"no rigid criteria\" governing its application, Libman v. Zuckerman, 33 Mass.  App. Ct. 341, 346 (1992).  Broadly stated, estoppel seeks to prevent a person \"from denying the consequences of his conduct where that conduct has been such as to induce another to change his position in good faith or such that a reasonable man would rely upon the representations made.\"  Bergeron v. Mansour, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1486534\"><a href=\"/opinion/1486534/bergeron-v-mansour/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 1945) (applying Massachusetts law).  In the statute of limitations context, the doctrine requires proof \"that the defendants made representations they knew or should have known would induce the plaintiffs to put off bringing a suit and that the plaintiffs did in fact delay in reliance on the representations.\"  White v. Peabody Constr.  Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2046989\"><a href=\"/opinion/2046989/white-v-peabody-construction-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 134 (1982);  accord, e.g., Whitcomb v.

It is unnecessary that defendant intentionally mislead or deceive the plaintiff, see, e.g., MacKeen v. Kasinskas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2084215\"><a href=\"/opinion/2084215/mackeen-v-kasinskas/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span>, 698 (1956), or even that defendant intend by its conduct to induce delay, see, e.g., LaBonte v. NY, NH &amp; Hart.  R.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2197915\"><a href=\"/opinion/2197915/labonte-v-new-york-new-haven-hartford-railroad/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 131 (1960) (\"one is responsible for the word or act which he knows, or ought to know, will be acted upon by another\") (emphasis added);  accord, e.g., Clauson v.

It is necessary, however, that \"[t]he reliance of the party seeking the benefit of estoppel [be] ... reasonable.\"  O'Blenes v. Zoning Board of Appeals, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2068087\"><a href=\"/opinion/2068087/oblenes-v-zoning-board-of-appeals-of-lynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 558 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In seeking to invoke this doctrine here, plaintiff points to communications between the parties' attorneys, particularly to a telephone conversation that occurred on January 27, 1992.  In an affidavit submitted below, plaintiff's trial counsel (John James) described that conversation with defendant's counsel (Frank Toto) as follows.  The attorneys there discussed the need for a declaratory judgment action in the event the matter was not settled.  James said he had been authorized to bring suit but would await defendant's response to a pending settlement demand.  When asked if defendant intended to file suit to resolve the coverage issue, Toto \"unequivocally\" stated that \"if the matter did not settle CNA would be bringing an action for declaratory judgment.\"  James replied that he would accept service of process on behalf of his client and that he \"would not file the action in anticipation of [defendant's] filing suit.\"  (Attached to the affidavit was a letter written by Toto to James three days later, which mentioned that \"[i]n our last conversation, ... you agreed to accept service of any declaratory judgment action CNA might file over the coverage issue.\")  In his affidavit, James went on to explain that he had believed, based on this conversation and his amicable relationship with Toto, that defendant would be filing suit;  that he had relied on this agreement in not bringing suit himself;  and that he immediately filed the action when it became apparent that defendant was not going to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendant contends that James' reliance on Toto's promise was unreasonable in light of the \"clarification\" that appeared in the latter's follow-up letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In its view, the reference there to \"any declaratory judgment action that CNA might file\" (emphasis added) was sufficient to call into question defendant's intentions in this regard.  A more plausible interpretation, we think, is that Toto's choice of language simply reflected the possibility that the case would be settled in the interim.  We find nothing in his letter that would seriously undercut an \"unequivocal\" promise voiced three days earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nonetheless agree that plaintiff's reliance on that representation was unreasonable as a matter of law.  From all that appears, Toto conveyed this pledge in a single telephone conversation, at a time when nearly two months remained before the limitations period expired.  The follow-up letter contained no explicit confirmation thereof, and the matter was never addressed again.  Most important, plaintiff took no steps thereafter to ascertain whether defendant had in fact fulfilled its promise.  This last factor proves largely dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case is unusual in that the representation at issue-a promise to file suit-concerned an action that was to be performed before the statute of limitations expired, not afterwards.  Plaintiff was thus in a position to confirm, prior to the March 19, 1992 deadline, that defendant had followed through on its pledge.  Yet no such steps were taken.  As that date approached, with no notice of any filing having been received, plaintiff failed even to place a telephone call to ascertain the status of events.  No matter how \"unequivocal\" Toto's statement had been, and no matter how cordial the attorneys' relationship was, we think that such a lack of diligence precluded invocation of equitable estoppel as a matter of law.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2068087\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">O'Blenes,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2068087/oblenes-v-zoning-board-of-appeals-of-lynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> at <span class=\"page\">558-59</span> </a></span>(holding that it was unreasonable for attorney to rely on statement by zoning board clerk as to when appeal period expired;  attorney \"had an obligation to determine\" the relevant facts);  cf.  Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, 96 (1990) (\"We have generally been much less forgiving in receiving late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights.\")  (quoted in McKinney v.
