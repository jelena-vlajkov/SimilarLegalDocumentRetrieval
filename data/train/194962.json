This  is an  appeal  from  a\n                            \n\ndecision  of the district  court withdrawing from  the jury a\n\ncommercial  dispute  at  the  end of  the  plaintiffs'  case.\n\nAlthough  we think  that the  plaintiffs' evidence  failed to\n\nshow  fraud  and we  treat an  aiding  and abetting  claim as\n\nabandoned,  the evidence of negligence and  injury was in our\n\nview  just   adequate  to   foreclose  a   directed  verdict.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the  ruling as to the fraud  claim but\n\nvacate the  judgment as to  the negligence claims  and remand\n\nfor further proceedings, strongly encouraging the parties  to\n\nexplore settlement of this case.\n\n                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n     Plaintiffs  are three individuals, Franklin D. Crawford,\n\nJohn P. Murray, Jr. and J. Michael Murray, known collectively\n\nas \"the Crawford Group,\" and an associated investment entity,\n\nBevmar  Acquisition Corp.   Defendants are Ross-Dove Company,\n\nInc., a commercial auction firm, and Dovetech,  a division of\n\nRoss-Dove  (which  may well  not be  a  suable entity).   The\n\ndispute  arises  out of  an  appraisal done  by  Ross-Dove of\n\ncertain  assets  of  Bevmar, Inc.  (\"Bevmar\"),  a  California\n\ncorporation formerly  engaged in the manufacture  and sale of\n\nelectronic circuitry panels.\n\n     In  1989,  one  Robert  H.  Marik,  an  acquaintance  of\n\nCrawford, organized  Bevmar Acquisition  Corp. as part  of an\n\neffort  to solicit  investments in  Bevmar.   In aid  of that\n\n                             -2-\n\neffort,  an  investment  banker  working with  Marik  engaged\n\nDovetech to appraise certain  of Bevmar's assets.  Dovetech's\n\nappraisal was  conducted by  Bruce Schneider, with  help from\n\nother  employees, and  was  completed  in  June 1989.    That\n\nappraisal valued  Bevmar's  machinery, equipment,  molds  and\n\ndies at three different values, ranging from over  $2 million\n\ntotal to over  $6 million depending  on the circumstances  of\n\nsale.  The appraisal  said that the appraised value  of molds\n\nand dies should not decline for at least three years.\n\n     In September  1989, Marik invited Crawford  to invest in\n\nBevmar, through the Bevmar  Acquisition Corp., and Marik made\n\nthe  Dovetech  appraisal  of  Bevmar's  assets  available  to\n\nCrawford.    Crawford  contacted  Schneider  to  explain  his\n\ninterest  in  Bevmar  and  to determine  the  status  of  the\n\nDovetech  appraisal.   Schneider  assured  Crawford  that the\n\nappraisal  was  still  valid.    In  October  1989  Crawford,\n\ntogether with the two Murrays, paid $3 million for a stake in\n\nBevmar comprising a loan to Bevmar to be repaid at 20 percent\n\nannual interest, a 40 percent equity interest in the company,\n\nand a bonus depending on the fortunes of the company.\n\n     To secure  the loan,  Bevmar gave  the Crawford  group a\n\nsecurity interest  in all of its  machinery, equipment, molds\n\nand dies.  There were some discrepancies between items listed\n\nin the  Dovetech appraisal and  items listed in  the recorded\n\nsecurity  filings, but the latter  lists were delayed and the\n\n                             -3-\n\ndiscrepancies  not  immediately  noticed.   What  did  become\n\nrapidly  apparent  was  that  Bevmar  was  in  deep  trouble.\n\nCrawford  invested a  further $500,000  but in  March 1990  a\n\nchapter 7  petition was filed and  Bevmar entered bankruptcy.\n\nWhen its assets  were liquidated, the amount  realized on the\n\nmachinery, equipment, molds and dies was about $453,000.\n\n     The plaintiffs then commenced  this suit in the district\n\ncourt  charging  Ross-Dove  and  Dovetech   with  negligence,\n\nnegligent misrepresentation,  fraud, and aiding  and abetting\n\nthe torts of others.1   Actual damages in the  amount of $4.5\n\nmillion  were  sought,  as  well  as  punitive  or  exemplary\n\ndamages.  The  gist of  the complaint was  that Dovetech  had\n\ncarelessly  or dishonestly  overestimated  the  value of  the\n\nassets  it had appraised in  June 1989 and  that the Crawford\n\ngroup had  relied  to  its  detriment on  that  appraisal  in\n\ninvesting in Bevmar.\n\n     After  discovery,  a  four-day  jury  trial  occurred in\n\nSeptember 1992.   Plaintiffs offered testimony  from a number\n\nof witnesses,  either in  person or by  deposition, including\n\nthe  three  Crawford  group members,  Schneider,  two  Bevmar\n\nemployees,  an employee  of  the company  that purchased  the\n\nmolds and  dies after  Bevmar's bankruptcy, and  an appraiser\n\nwho had appraised Bevmar machinery  and equipment and given a\n\n                    \n\n     1The last  of  these  claims  is not  discussed  in  the\nplaintiffs'  brief  on appeal,  there  is  scant evidence  to\nsupport such a claim, and we treat it as abandoned.\n\n                             -4-\n\ngeneral  opinion about  the value  of its  molds and  dies in\n\nMarch  1989.   Surprisingly,  plaintiffs did  not provide  an\n\nexpert   witness  to   testify  as   to  the   inadequacy  or\n\nincompetence of Dovetech's appraisal.2\n\n     At  the  close  of plaintiffs'  case,  defendants sought\n\njudgment as a matter  of law under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 50(a)(1),\n\nthe  current name  of the  traditional relief  afforded  by a\n\ndirected  verdict.  On  October 1,  1992, the  district court\n\ndelivered a detailed oral opinion concluding  that plaintiffs\n\nhad  failed to show that the appraisal was inaccurate or that\n\ndefendants  were at  fault.   Alternatively, the  court found\n\nfailures of proof as to justifiable reliance on the appraisal\n\nand as  to causation of injury.  Although we regard this case\n\nas a close  call, on balance we think that  plaintiffs did at\n\nthe completion of their opening case have enough  evidence to\n\nreach a jury on a negligence theory.\n\n                         II. ANALYSIS\n\n     On  a Rule  50(a) motion,  appellate review  is plenary.\n\nAmerican Private Line Serv., Inc. v. Eastern Microwave, Inc.,\n                                                            \n\n980 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1992).  The evidence and inferences\n\nfrom it are  considered in  the light most  favorable to  the\n\n                    \n\n     2Plaintiffs belatedly attempted to add an expert witness\nbut this  was disallowed because  the witness was  not timely\nlisted as  required by pretrial orders.   Plaintiffs complain\nbut  we see no error in this  ruling.  The district court did\nallow plaintiff to make use of deposition testimony  of Steve\nPiletz,  an expert appraiser who had appraised certain of the\nassets in March 1989.\n\n                             -5-\n\nparty opposing the  directed verdict,  here, the  plaintiffs.\n\nRaymond  Steel, Inc. v.  Puerto Rican American  Ins. Co., 954\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 1992).  A directed verdict is proper at\n\nthe  close  of plaintiffs'  case  only  when the  plaintiffs'\n\nevidence, viewed in this light, would not permit a reasonable\n\njury  to find in favor  of the plaintiffs  on any permissible\n\nclaim or theory.\n\n     A reviewing  court must thus ask  whether the plaintiffs\n\nhave  offered   enough   evidence  to   permit  findings   in\n\nplaintiffs' favor on each of the  elements necessary to prove\n                         \n\nat least one cause of action.  Here, the parties have assumed\n\nthat Rhode  Island law defines  the causes of  action--why is\n\nnot clear--and we  accept this  premise.  See  In re  Newport\n                                                             \n\nPlaza Associates,  L.P., 985 F.2d  640, 644 (1st  Cir. 1993).\n                       \n\nIt  also appears to be common ground that, under Rhode Island\n\nlaw,  a   cause  of   action  for  negligence   or  negligent\n\nmisrepresentation  exists  if  the  Dovetech   appraisal  was\n\ninaccurate, the inaccuracy  stemmed from negligence, reliance\n\non the appraisal was  justified, and the reliance proximately\n\n                             -6-\n\nresulted in injury.3   With  this yardstick, we  turn to  the\n\nevidence.\n\n                    \n\n     3Because  plaintiffs' claims of negligence and negligent\nmisrepresentation  both  allege  negligent  supply  of  false\ninformation,  we will consider them  as the same  claim.  See\n                                                             \nRalston  Dry-Wall Co., Inc. v.  United States Gypsum Co., 740\n                                                        \nF. Supp. 926, 932 (D.R.I. 1990), aff'd, 926 F.2d 99 (1st Cir.\n                                      \n1991).  The Rhode  Island Supreme Court has not  yet directly\naddressed  a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation,\nOstalkiewicz  v.  Guardian Alarm,  520  A.2d  563, 569  (R.I.\n                                \n1987), but federal courts applying Rhode Island law have held\nthat negligent misrepresentation is actionable.   E.g., Banco\n                                                             \nTotta e Acores v. Fleet Nat'l Bank, 768 F. Supp.  943, 946-47\n                                  \n(D.R.I. 1991);  Ralston Dry-Wall Company, Inc.,  740 F. Supp.\n                                              \nat 932.\n\n                             -7-\n\n                   A.  Inaccuracy and Fault\n                                           \n\n     The first two elements,  inaccuracy in the appraisal and\n\nnegligence in  its preparation, are closely  related and need\n\nto  be considered  together.  In  the abstract,  an appraisal\n\ncould be inaccurate without fault,  or it could be carelessly\n\nprepared but correct in its conclusion.  But in this case, as\n\nin  many, the issues overlap  because if inaccuracy is shown,\n\nthe magnitude  of  the inaccuracy  may  be some  evidence  of\n\nnegligence.   How strong the  inference would be  depends, as\n\nusual, on the facts.\n\n     Here, plaintiffs'  best case for error  in the appraisal\n\nand for negligence, stripped to its essentials, can be easily\n\nsummarized.  First and  most  important,  plaintiffs  offered\n\nevidence of a gross disparity between the appraisals of value\n\nassigned by Dovetech  to the  Bevmar molds and  dies in  June\n\n1989 and the  value realized  for the Bevmar  molds and  dies\n\nabout a year later.  In the Dovetech appraisal, the molds and\n\ndies were evaluated as follows:\n\n     AUCTION:  $16,000 x 96 = $1,536,000\n     ORDERLY:  $21,000 x 96 = $2,016,000\n     IN PLACE: $42,000 x 96 = $4,032,000\n\nAccording to  the appraisal, \"auction\" meant  disposition \"as\n\nis\" at an  auction sale completed in a 30-40  day time frame;\n\n\"orderly\"  meant orderly  liquidation over  a maximum  of six\n\nmonths;   and  \"in  place\"  meant  as   part  of  an  ongoing\n\nenterprise.\n\n                             -8-\n\n     When the  96 molds and  dies were auctioned as  a lot in\n\nJuly 1990,  the winning bid was $40,000 for the whole lot and\n\nwas  made by Elcor Corporation,  which had sold  96 molds and\n\ndies to Bevmar in  1986.  When its representative  arrived to\n\ncollect the  molds and  dies, he  found some  to  be in  poor\n\ncondition and others to be incomplete, missing or  claimed by\n\nanother  company.   Thus the  plaintiffs' starting  point was\n\ntheir  proof (subject  to reservations  yet to  be discussed)\n\nthat  molds and  dies appraised  at a  minimum price  of $1.5\n\nmillion in 1989 had sold for less than 3 percent  of the this\n\nfigure a year later.\n\n     There  was far less of  a disparity as  to the machinery\n\nand equipment; the minimum  estimate provided by Dovetech was\n\naround  $676,000 and  the  auctions of  these items  returned\n\nabout $413,000.  The district court, after evaluating the gap\n\nbetween  the  appraisal  and   the  realized  price  for  the\n\nmachinery and equipment found no proof of material inaccuracy\n\nat  all.  But the molds and dies represented about two-thirds\n\nof  the  total value  attributed  by  Dovetech to  machinery,\n\nequipment,  molds  and  dies.    A  serious  error  in  their\n\nappraisal could  by itself  easily be  an adequate  basis for\n\nfinding the appraisal to be materially in error.    \n\n     The  disparity  in the  price  predicted  and the  price\n\nrealized  for the molds and  dies is hardly  conclusive.  The\n\nauction might  not  have  been fair,  although  there  is  no\n\n                             -9-\n\nsuggestion  of that in this record.  Or conditions might have\n\nchanged  so materially  that no  negligence could  be imputed\n\nbased on the disparity;  in this instance, Crawford testified\n\nbriefly that market conditions had if anything improved.  But\n\na very large  and unexplained disparity offers  a prima facie\n\ncase of error in the appraisal and  at least some evidence of\n\nnegligence.\n\n     Whether  the  huge disparity  here  would  be sufficient\n\nevidence of negligence need not be decided, because there was\n\nfurther  evidence  that  cast  an unfavorable  light  on  the\n\nappraisal.  All of the Bevmar  molds and dies were located at\n\nBevmar's California  plant or at about  eight other locations\n\nwhere  they  were  held  by  Bevmar  subcontractors  to  make\n\nproducts  for Bevmar.   Schneider  testified that  he visited\n\neach of the nine  locations in making his appraisal  and then\n\nconsulted by  telephone with subcontractors and  others as to\n\nwhat they would pay if the molds and dies were sold.\n\n     But  Elcor's representative  testified that  after Elcor\n\nwon  the  bid  a year  later,  he  visited each  of  the nine\n\nlocations and found many  of the items in poor  condition, in\n\nsome cases  even unusable.   And a Bevmar  employee testified\n\nthat Schneider  had visited only three  of the subcontractors\n\nwhen doing his appraisal, had not even examined all the molds\n\nand dies  at these three stops,  and had been  told that some\n\nitems were missing.   There was testimony that the  molds and\n\n                             -10-\n\ndies were different and in different condition.  Against this\n\nbackground, a jury could have regarded Schneider's assignment\n\nof a uniform  figure to each of the 96  molds and dies (e.g.,\n                                                            \n\n$16,000  apiece if  auctioned)  as highly  suspicious and  as\n\nfurther evidence that Schneider had done a sloppy appraisal.\n\n     The deposition  testimony of  Schneider could  also have\n\nreinforced  a   jury's  judgment   that  the   appraisal  was\n\nnegligent.  His expert credentials were fairly  thin but, far\n\nworse, portions of his deposition transcript read to the jury\n\nwere  littered  with  the entry  \"no  response\"  when he  was\n\npressed  on the  puzzling uniformity  of figures  and related\n\nmatters.   There was no  real evidence of fraud  or of aiding\n\nand abetting  fraud, and we do  not fault the  trial court in\n\nwithdrawing this issue  from the jury.  Yet at  least some of\n\nthe evidence that plaintiffs  associate with fraud could have\n\nfurther undermined the jury's confidence in Schneider's skill\n\nand care.4\n\n     We  think  that  the  evidence recited  would  permit  a\n\nreasonable jury to conclude that Schneider's appraisal of the\n\nmolds and dies was erroneous  in the sense that it was  not a\n\n                    \n\n     4Schneider  relied  in   appraising  the  machinery  and\nequipment  located on the  East Coast on  photographs sent to\nhim  by a  Dovetech  employee  based  in Massachusetts.    He\napparently  knew  that Marik  was  seeking  a high  appraisal\nfigure.   And he  was associated,  although the  evidence was\nsomewhat confused, with a possible proposal in September 1989\nfor Ross-Dove itself to  offer $500,000 to Bevmar for  all of\nthe items in  question, the  same month in  which he  assured\nCrawford that the June 1989 appraisal was still valid.\n\n                             -11-\n\nresponsible estimate of value  and, further, to conclude that\n\nits preparation was negligent.  A jury might not so find, and\n\na strong defense case might make such findings less likely or\n\neven impossible.   Still, limiting ourselves  to the evidence\n\nas it stood at  the close of plaintiffs' case,  and resolving\n\ninferences  and   issue  of  credibility  in   favor  of  the\n\nplaintiffs,  we  think that  a  jury  that  found  error  and\n\nnegligence in the appraisal would not be irrational.\n\n     We turn  now to the  district court's discussion  of the\n\nmolds  and dies, a subject that the court fairly described as\n\ndifficult  and to which it gave careful attention.  The court\n\ngave three reasons for  disregarding the discrepancy  between\n\nappraisal and realized value.  The first was that Schneider's\n\nappraisal  was  based on  the market  value  of the  items as\n\nfunctioning molds  and dies whereas  the molds and  dies were\n\n(in the  district court's words) \"apparently  sold at auction\n\nas scrap,\" some being  operational and some not.   This, said\n\nthe court,  made a comparison between  predicted and realized\n\nprice of the items a comparison of apples and oranges.\n\n     With  respect, we think it might be more accurate to say\n\nthat Schneider  appraised the  molds and  dies as  apples but\n\nthey, or  some of them, turned out to be  oranges.  It is not\n\nclear what knowledge Elcor  had of the molds and  dies before\n\nthe auction.  The molds and dies seem to have been advertised\n\nfor auction as  operational, since pictures of the items they\n\n                             -12-\n\ncould produce were offered.  Having sold 96 molds and dies to\n\nBevmar  in 1986, Elcor may have supposed that it already knew\n\nwhat  it was  getting.   At the  same time,  Elcor's bid  was\n\ncertainly  very low  and may  be open  to the  inference that\n\nElcor knew that many of the items were scrap or little more.\n\n     No doubt, as the district court assumed, it  is implicit\n\nin Schneider's estimate  of $1.5 million  that the molds  and\n\ndies would be bought  for use, for $1.5 million  is obviously\n\nabove scrap  value.5   But  by  the  same token  it  is  also\n\nimplicit  in the appraisal that they were capable of such use\n\nand would normally be  so employed, absent a major  change in\n\nmarket conditions or in  the items themselves.  Yet  there is\n\nno evidence  that market conditions had changed  by July 1990\n\nor that  the items themselves had  unexpectedly deteriorated.\n\nIn sum,  a jury could  condemn Schneider  for appraising  the\n                                                             \n\nmolds  and  dies as  useful when  in  fact they  were largely\n                                                             \n\nscrap.\n     \n\n     Second, the  district court  observed that the  buyer of\n\nthe molds and dies  at the auction got  only 20 to 40  of the\n\nmolds and dies.  The court found these to be \"a far cry\" from\n\nthe 96 that were  appraised by Dovetech, the more  so because\n\nthe  court said  that the more  valuable ones  were excluded.\n\n                    \n\n     5Piletz, who appraised Bevmar's machinery  and equipment\nin   March  1989,   offered  an   informed  guess   based  on\nreproduction value--not an appraisal--that the molds and dies\n\"might\" sell for about $158,000 if sold as scrap and $634,000\nif sold for continued use.\n\n                             -13-\n\nThe  court  evidently   believed  that  the  discrepancy   in\n\nappraisal and  price might  have been explained  by the  fact\n\nthat Dovetech  was appraising  a more extensive  and valuable\n\ncollection of molds and dies than the subset that was finally\n\nbought by Elcor.\n\n     The evidence,  however, permitted the jury  to find that\n\nElcor bid  on  the list  of  96 molds  and  dies without  any\n\nknowledge  that  some  were  missing  or  owned  by  others.6\n\nFurther, Crawford's testimony that Elcor had found only 20 to\n\n40 dies is coupled with the statement that many were obsolete\n\nand \"[h]ad not been running for  years.\"  The jury could well\n\nhave  thought  that, whatever  the  number  owned by  Bevmar,\n\nSchneider had no business appraising such items at an average\n\nvalue apiece of $16,000 (auction) to $42,000 (in place).\n            \n\n     Third,  the  district   court  held  that  because   the\n\ndiscrepancy  reflected a difference  between market value and\n\nscrap  value,  plaintiffs  were  required  to  offer   expert\n\nevidence that  Schneider had erred in adopting a market value\n\napproach; absent  such expert  guidance, said the  court, the\n\njury would  be  left to  \"speculate\"  on which  approach  was\n\ncorrect.  Rhode Island law, even assuming that it controls on\n\nthis issue, does  not automatically require expert  testimony\n\n                    \n\n     6The 96 molds and dies were advertised as a lot, and the\nElcor   testimony  is   open  to   the  inference   that  its\nrepresentative was  surprised  when the  post-auction  survey\nrevealed fewer than had been promised.\n\n                             -14-\n\nto show negligence.  Murphy v.  United Steelworkers, 507 D.2d\n                                                   \n\n1342, 1345-46  (R.I. 1986).  But  we agree that,  if a choice\n\nwere  required   between  competing  concepts   of  value  or\n\ncompeting  techniques of  appraisal an  expert might  well be\n\nrequired.7\n\n     Here, however, the evidence permitted the jury to assume\n\nthat Schneider's concept  of market value  was proper but  to\n\nconclude that he  had negligently  assigned excessive  market\n\nvalues to many  of the molds and dies.   And we conclude that\n\nthe jury  was capable of appraising  the plaintiffs' evidence\n\nof  disparity and fault on its own, although expert testimony\n\nwould surely have been prudent and helpful.  There is nothing\n\nrecherche about the reasoning  behind the inferences based on\n\nthe  huge discrepancy  between  appraisal  and proceeds,  the\n\nsuspiciously uniform  estimates, and Schneider's  failure (if\n\nthe jury so found) to visit each of the sites and inspect the\n\nmolds.\n\n                  B.  Reliance and Causation\n                                            \n\n     This brings us to  the second element of  the negligence\n\ncause  of action for which the district court found a failure\n\n                    \n\n     7Piletz' deposition suggests that  he did believe that a\ndifferent  method  of  appraising  molds and  dies  than  the\ntelephone survey used  by Schneider  was called for.   It  is\nvery doubtful that Piletz' alternative approach was explained\nadequately to  permit the jury to  reject Schneider's method.\nBut plaintiffs' far better case was that Schneider had used a\npermissible method but botched  the job by failing to  do any\nadequate inspection or make adequate inquiry. \n\n                             -15-\n\nof proof, namely, justifiable reliance.   A bit of background\n\nis  required.    The   evidence  suggested  that  there  were\n\ndiscrepancies,  of  several  different  kinds,  between  what\n\nDovetech  appraised  and what  Bevmar  actually  owned.   The\n\nmissing molds  and dies and uncertainties  about ownership of\n\nothers have  already been mentioned.   It  also appears  that\n\nsome of the machinery and equipment in the appraisal may have\n\nbelonged  to a Rhode Island  state entity but  was counted in\n\nthe appraisal.      The  district  court   found  a  lack  of\n\njustifiable reliance  because, it said,  the plaintiffs  were\n\nnot entitled  to  rely on  the  appraisal to  establish  that\n\nBevmar owned the  items appraised.   To the  extent that  the\n\nitems  were  not  owned  by Bevmar,  naturally  the  security\n\ninterest in Bevmar's inventory of equipment, machinery, molds\n\nand  dies  had  a  reduced  value.    Therefore,   the  court\n\nconcluded, \"the evidence  establishes as a matter of law that\n\nthere  was  no  justifiable  reliance  on  the  appraisal  to\n\nestablish the expected security interest in these assets.\"\n\n     Plaintiffs  concede that  the  ownership  of  the  items\n\nappraised  was not within the scope of the representations in\n\nthe appraisal.  At most,  the appraisal purported to appraise\n\nproperty at Bevmar's facilities or, in the case of some molds\n\nand  dies,  property  Bevmar  claimed to  have  lent  to  its\n\nsubcontractors.   Thus it is true  that plaintiffs would have\n\nno case if  their cause  of action depended  on showing  that\n\n                             -16-\n\nthey  reasonably  relied  upon  the  appraisal  to  establish\n\nBevmar's title.   It seems  to us that  plaintiffs' cause  of\n\naction, specifically the showing of reliance and injury, does\n\nnot depend on such a showing.\n\n     The problem is confused  because plaintiffs in this case\n\nhave been somewhat fuzzy  in their theory of damages.   It is\n\noften attractive for a  plaintiff with evidence of wrongdoing\n\nand evidence of loss  to throw the evidence  to the jury  and\n\nhope  that the jury  will make a causal  connection.  In this\n\ncase  plaintiffs had  available  two different  theories, and\n\nthere are hints of both in  its pleadings and arguments.  One\n\ntheory is  that, but  for the misappraisal,  plaintiffs would\n\nnot  have invested  at all  and would  still have  their $3.5\n\nmillion; the other is that their security interest would have\n\nbeen worth more if the appraisal had been accurate.\n\n     Plaintiffs offered  their  own testimony  on  the  first\n\ntheory,  namely, that they  would not  have made  the initial\n\ninvestment if they had known that the assets in question were\n\nworth  far  less  than  the  appraisal   said.8    From  this\n\nstandpoint,  it does not matter whether some of the assets in\n\nquestion   belonged   to   Rhode    Island   or   to   Bevmar\n\n                    \n\n     8The testimony on this issue is not crystal clear but it\nwas adequate  for the jury  to draw  such a conclusion.   And\ngiven  the  importance the  Crawford  group  attached to  the\nappraisal,  evidenced by  other facts  (e.g., the  inquiry to\n                                            \nSchneider   and   a   separate   inquiry   into   Ross-Dove's\nreputation), the conclusion is eminently plausible.\n\n                             -17-\n\nsubcontractors.  If  plaintiffs' testimony is accepted,  then\n\nthe mistaken appraisal \"caused\" the loss in the familiar \"but\n\nfor\" sense:   but for  the mistake,  the loss would  not have\n\noccurred.  (We defer for the moment questions of  intervening\n\ncause.)  The  validity of the security  agreement simply does\n\nnot matter.\n\n     Its  validity  very  much  does  matter  on  the  second\n\npossible theory of injury, namely, that the misrepresentation\n\ncaused  loss insofar  as  it  overstated  the  value  of  the\n\nsecurity  interest,  reducing plaintiffs'  protection  in the\n\nevent  of bankruptcy.   On  this  theory, any  misestimate of\n\nvalue would indeed be  harmless as to those assets  that were\n                                                             \n\nmisappraised  but  were not  owned  by Bevmar.    Whether one\n                                             \n\nspeaks of unjustified reliance  or lack of causal connection,\n\nplaintiffs' damage  claims would be  proportionately reduced.\n\nPerhaps any damage  recovery on this  second theory might  be\n           \n\nspeculative on  this  record;9 but  we  need not  decide  the\n\npoint  for there  is nothing  obviously wrong with  the first\n\ntheory as a basis for getting to the jury.\n\n     Defendants on  appeal offer  a different argument  as to\n\nwhy  Crawford's  reliance  on  the  appraisal  could  not  be\n\njustifiable reliance.   They argue that the  appraisal by its\n\n                    \n\n     9Arguably, it  would  be plaintiffs'  responsibility  to\nshow  which assets  were owned  by Bevmar  and the  extent to\nwhich, as to those assets, the appraisal figure  exceeded the\nprice  received at auction.  It is unclear whether the record\npermits such an allocation.\n\n                             -18-\n\nterms required the  consent of  Dovetech before  it could  be\n\ndistributed  to third parties other than Marik and Bevmar and\n\nthat, at least implicitly, this caveat made reliance on it by\n\nthird party investors unreasonable.   This view, if accepted,\n\nwould  undercut both  of  plaintiffs'  possible  theories  of\n\ninjury.  It was not adopted  by the district court as a basis\n\nfor the directed verdict.\n\n     There was evidence at trial that Dovetech  knew that its\n\nappraisal would  be distributed to financing  sources such as\n\nplaintiffs.   Crawford also testified that  he told Schneider\n\nthat  he  (Crawford) and  others were  going  to rely  on the\n\nappraisal in making their investment and Schneider reaffirmed\n\nits  validity.   Piletz testified  that appraisers  know that\n\ntheir work will be relied  on by third parties.  Thus  a jury\n\nmight  find that,  even if  the appraisal  caveat is  read as\n\ndefendants urge,  Dovetech had  waived its protection  or had\n\ntreated the Crawford group as  among those for whose  benefit\n\nthe appraisal had been done.\n\n      Finally we turn to the district  court's third and last\n\nreason  for its directed  verdict, which can  be described as\n\naccepting an \"intervening cause\" defense.  The district court\n\nfound  that the lists of assets appraised by Dovetech did not\n\nmatch  the list  of assets  included in  plaintiffs' security\n\nagreement filing;  that attorneys acting in  some measure for\n\nplaintiffs  disbursed plaintiffs' money at the closing before\n\n                             -19-\n\ncertain of plaintiffs'  conditions were  satisfied; and  that\n\nthe  bankruptcy trustee  had challenged  the validity  of the\n\nplaintiffs'  security  interest  in  the  pending  bankruptcy\n\nproceedings   (a  challenge  that  has  now  apparently  been\n\ndropped).\n\n     The  first and  last  of these  \"intervening causes\"  of\n\ninjury are  irrelevant so  far as  the plaintiffs proceed  on\n\ntheir first theory of recovery: as already shown, that theory\n\ndoes  not depend on the validity of the security agreement at\n\nall.   The  remaining \"intervening  cause\" is  the attorneys'\n\nalleged  failure to insist at the closing that other promised\n\nthird-party  investments in  Bevmar  be  committed  and  that\n\ncertain  liens  against  its  property  be  satisfied.    The\n\ndistrict court's conclusion may  rest on the assumption that,\n\nif  the client  instructions  had been  followed, either  the\n\ninitial $3 million would  never have been paid over  or, less\n\nlikely, the conditions if  satisfied would have prevented the\n\nfailure of Bevmar.\n\n     There  was some  evidence  of  the  attorneys'  supposed\n\ndisregard  of   instructions,  but  very  little   about  the\n\nsignificance or consequences of such disregard.  Rhode Island\n\nlaw  is  not  especially  friendly to  an  intervening  cause\n\ndefense,  nor  especially  precise;  and  a  jury  instructed\n\n                             -20-\n\naccording  to the  state's case  law might  have considerable\n\nlatitude.10    Measured  against  such language,  we  do  not\n\nthink  that the  evidence presented  as to  counsel's alleged\n\nmistake at the  closing compelled  a jury to  decide that  an\n                                 \n\nintervening cause was responsible  for the plaintiffs'  loss.\n\nWhether in  presenting their  defense defendants  could offer\n\nmore powerful evidence on this point is another matter.\n\n                       III.  CONCLUSION\n\n     To sum up, we  agree with the district court  that there\n\nwas  insufficient evidence of fraud to submit that claim to a\n\njury.  But in our view the jury did have sufficient evidence,\n\njudged at the close of the plaintiffs' case, to find material\n\nerror  in the  appraisal and  negligence in  its preparation.\n\nWhile plaintiffs  may face  hurdles on issues  of justifiable\n\nreliance,  causation,  and  damages,  we  think  for  reasons\n\nexplained  above that  a  directed verdict  on those  grounds\n\ncannot be justified at this stage.\n\n                    \n\n     10Thus,  \"an   intervening  act  will  not   insulate  a\ndefendant from  liability if his negligence  was a concurring\nproximate cause which had not been  rendered remote by reason\nof  the  secondary  cause  which  intervened.\"    Roberts  v.\n                                                         \nKettelle, 356 A.2d 207, 215 (R.I. 1976).  The first negligent\n        \nact will be  rendered remote  if \"a second  actor has  become\naware  of the existence of  a potential danger  caused by the\nnegligence  of  a  first  actor  and  the second  actor  acts\nnegligently with regard  to the dangerous  condition, thereby\nbringing  about  an accident  with injurious  consequences to\nothers.\"   Walsh v. Israel Couture Post, No. 2274 V.F.W., 542\n                                                        \nA.2d 1094, 1096-97 (R.I. 1988).  Further, \"an intervening act\nof negligence will not insulate an original tortfeasor  if it\nappears that such  intervening act is a natural  and probable\nconsequence of the initial tortfeasor's act.\"  Id. at 1097.\n                                                  \n\n                             -21-\n\n     On  remand  this  case  should be  settled,  if  humanly\n\npossible.   The discrepancy  between the appraisal  value and\n\nthe amount  ultimately realized  for molds and  dies, coupled\n\nwith  the doubts  raised about the  appraisal's thoroughness,\n\nought to make the defense quite  uneasy about fault.  On  the\n\nother hand, the defense may  be able in its own case  to do a\n\nbetter  job   of  explaining  the  discrepancy   between  the\n\nappraisal  and  auction  price  of  the  96  molds  and  dies\n\nappraised  by  Schneider.   How a  jury  will dispose  of the\n\nintervening cause defense is  anyone's guess.  And even  if a\n\njury makes an award, the award can be appealed.\n\n     The  parties  now  have  a  pretty  fair  gauge  of  the\n\nrespective  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  their  positions.\n\nMoney spent on  further litigation  is a loss  to both  sides\n\nregardless of the outcome, since most litigation expenses are\n\nnot  recoverable.  Full reconstruction  of the events in this\n\ncase for a  jury is likely  to be  especially expensive.   We\n\nthink  counsel would  not be  serving the interests  of their\n\nclients  if they failed to  make an earnest  effort to settle\n\nthis case.\n\n     The judgment  of the district court  is affirmed insofar\n                                                     \n\nas it  granted judgment as a  matter of law on  the claims of\n\nfraud  and aiding and abetting and is vacated with respect to\n                                             \n\nthe  negligence claims.    The case  is remanded  for further\n                                                \n\nproceedings.  No costs.\n\n                             -22-\n",

This  is an  appeal  from  a\n                            \n\ndecision  of the district  court withdrawing from  the jury a\n\ncommercial  dispute  at  the  end of  the  plaintiffs'  case.\n\nAlthough  we think  that the  plaintiffs' evidence  failed to\n\nshow  fraud  and we  treat an  aiding  and abetting  claim as\n\nabandoned,  the evidence of negligence and  injury was in our\n\nview  just   adequate  to   foreclose  a   directed  verdict.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the  ruling as to the fraud  claim but\n\nvacate the  judgment as to  the negligence claims  and remand\n\nfor further proceedings, strongly encouraging the parties  to\n\nexplore settlement of this case.\n\n                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n     Plaintiffs  are three individuals, Franklin D. Crawford,\n\nJohn P. Murray, Jr. and J. Michael Murray, known collectively\n\nas \"the Crawford Group,\" and an associated investment entity,\n\nBevmar  Acquisition Corp.   Defendants are Ross-Dove Company,\n\nInc., a commercial auction firm, and Dovetech,  a division of\n\nRoss-Dove  (which  may well  not be  a  suable entity).   The\n\ndispute  arises  out of  an  appraisal done  by  Ross-Dove of\n\ncertain  assets  of  Bevmar, Inc.  (\"Bevmar\"),  a  California\n\ncorporation formerly  engaged in the manufacture  and sale of\n\nelectronic circuitry panels.\n\n     In  1989,  one  Robert  H.  Marik,  an  acquaintance  of\n\nCrawford, organized  Bevmar Acquisition  Corp. as part  of an\n\neffort  to solicit  investments in  Bevmar.   In aid  of that\n\n                             -2-\n\neffort,  an  investment  banker  working with  Marik  engaged\n\nDovetech to appraise certain  of Bevmar's assets.  Dovetech's\n\nappraisal was  conducted by  Bruce Schneider, with  help from\n\nother  employees, and  was  completed  in  June 1989.    That\n\nappraisal valued  Bevmar's  machinery, equipment,  molds  and\n\ndies at three different values, ranging from over  $2 million\n\ntotal to over  $6 million depending  on the circumstances  of\n\nsale.  The appraisal  said that the appraised value  of molds\n\nand dies should not decline for at least three years.\n\n     In September  1989, Marik invited Crawford  to invest in\n\nBevmar, through the Bevmar  Acquisition Corp., and Marik made\n\nthe  Dovetech  appraisal  of  Bevmar's  assets  available  to\n\nCrawford.    Crawford  contacted  Schneider  to  explain  his\n\ninterest  in  Bevmar  and  to determine  the  status  of  the\n\nDovetech  appraisal.   Schneider  assured  Crawford  that the\n\nappraisal  was  still  valid.    In  October  1989  Crawford,\n\ntogether with the two Murrays, paid $3 million for a stake in\n\nBevmar comprising a loan to Bevmar to be repaid at 20 percent\n\nannual interest, a 40 percent equity interest in the company,\n\nand a bonus depending on the fortunes of the company.\n\n     To secure  the loan,  Bevmar gave  the Crawford  group a\n\nsecurity interest  in all of its  machinery, equipment, molds\n\nand dies.  There were some discrepancies between items listed\n\nin the  Dovetech appraisal and  items listed in  the recorded\n\nsecurity  filings, but the latter  lists were delayed and the\n\n                             -3-\n\ndiscrepancies  not  immediately  noticed.   What  did  become\n\nrapidly  apparent  was  that  Bevmar  was  in  deep  trouble.\n\nCrawford  invested a  further $500,000  but in  March 1990  a\n\nchapter 7  petition was filed and  Bevmar entered bankruptcy.\n\nWhen its assets  were liquidated, the amount  realized on the\n\nmachinery, equipment, molds and dies was about $453,000.\n\n     The plaintiffs then commenced  this suit in the district\n\ncourt  charging  Ross-Dove  and  Dovetech   with  negligence,\n\nnegligent misrepresentation,  fraud, and aiding  and abetting\n\nthe torts of others.1   Actual damages in the  amount of $4.5\n\nmillion  were  sought,  as  well  as  punitive  or  exemplary\n\ndamages.  The  gist of  the complaint was  that Dovetech  had\n\ncarelessly  or dishonestly  overestimated  the  value of  the\n\nassets  it had appraised in  June 1989 and  that the Crawford\n\ngroup had  relied  to  its  detriment on  that  appraisal  in\n\ninvesting in Bevmar.\n\n     After  discovery,  a  four-day  jury  trial  occurred in\n\nSeptember 1992.   Plaintiffs offered testimony  from a number\n\nof witnesses,  either in  person or by  deposition, including\n\nthe  three  Crawford  group members,  Schneider,  two  Bevmar\n\nemployees,  an employee  of  the company  that purchased  the\n\nmolds and  dies after  Bevmar's bankruptcy, and  an appraiser\n\nwho had appraised Bevmar machinery  and equipment and given a\n\n                    \n\n     1The last  of  these  claims  is not  discussed  in  the\nplaintiffs'  brief  on appeal,  there  is  scant evidence  to\nsupport such a claim, and we treat it as abandoned.\n\n                             -4-\n\ngeneral  opinion about  the value  of its  molds and  dies in\n\nMarch  1989.   Surprisingly,  plaintiffs did  not provide  an\n\nexpert   witness  to   testify  as   to  the   inadequacy  or\n\nincompetence of Dovetech's appraisal.2\n\n     At  the  close  of plaintiffs'  case,  defendants sought\n\njudgment as a matter  of law under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 50(a)(1),\n\nthe  current name  of the  traditional relief  afforded  by a\n\ndirected  verdict.  On  October 1,  1992, the  district court\n\ndelivered a detailed oral opinion concluding  that plaintiffs\n\nhad  failed to show that the appraisal was inaccurate or that\n\ndefendants  were at  fault.   Alternatively, the  court found\n\nfailures of proof as to justifiable reliance on the appraisal\n\nand as  to causation of injury.  Although we regard this case\n\nas a close  call, on balance we think that  plaintiffs did at\n\nthe completion of their opening case have enough  evidence to\n\nreach a jury on a negligence theory.\n\n                         II.

Inaccuracy and Fault\n                                           \n\n     The first two elements,  inaccuracy in the appraisal and\n\nnegligence in  its preparation, are closely  related and need\n\nto  be considered  together.  In  the abstract,  an appraisal\n\ncould be inaccurate without fault,  or it could be carelessly\n\nprepared but correct in its conclusion.  But in this case, as\n\nin  many, the issues overlap  because if inaccuracy is shown,\n\nthe magnitude  of  the inaccuracy  may  be some  evidence  of\n\nnegligence.   How strong the  inference would be  depends, as\n\nusual, on the facts.\n\n     Here, plaintiffs'  best case for error  in the appraisal\n\nand for negligence, stripped to its essentials, can be easily\n\nsummarized.  First and  most  important,  plaintiffs  offered\n\nevidence of a gross disparity between the appraisals of value\n\nassigned by Dovetech  to the  Bevmar molds and  dies in  June\n\n1989 and the  value realized  for the Bevmar  molds and  dies\n\nabout a year later.  In the Dovetech appraisal, the molds and\n\ndies were evaluated as follows:\n\n     AUCTION:  $16,000 x 96 = $1,536,000\n     ORDERLY:  $21,000 x 96 = $2,016,000\n     IN PLACE: $42,000 x 96 = $4,032,000\n\nAccording to  the appraisal, \"auction\" meant  disposition \"as\n\nis\" at an  auction sale completed in a 30-40  day time frame;\n\n\"orderly\"  meant orderly  liquidation over  a maximum  of six\n\nmonths;   and  \"in  place\"  meant  as   part  of  an  ongoing\n\nenterprise.\n\n                             -8-\n\n     When the  96 molds and  dies were auctioned as  a lot in\n\nJuly 1990,  the winning bid was $40,000 for the whole lot and\n\nwas  made by Elcor Corporation,  which had sold  96 molds and\n\ndies to Bevmar in  1986.  When its representative  arrived to\n\ncollect the  molds and  dies, he  found some  to  be in  poor\n\ncondition and others to be incomplete, missing or  claimed by\n\nanother  company.   Thus the  plaintiffs' starting  point was\n\ntheir  proof (subject  to reservations  yet to  be discussed)\n\nthat  molds and  dies appraised  at a  minimum price  of $1.5\n\nmillion in 1989 had sold for less than 3 percent  of the this\n\nfigure a year later.\n\n     There  was far less of  a disparity as  to the machinery\n\nand equipment; the minimum  estimate provided by Dovetech was\n\naround  $676,000 and  the  auctions of  these items  returned\n\nabout $413,000.  The district court, after evaluating the gap\n\nbetween  the  appraisal  and   the  realized  price  for  the\n\nmachinery and equipment found no proof of material inaccuracy\n\nat  all.  But the molds and dies represented about two-thirds\n\nof  the  total value  attributed  by  Dovetech to  machinery,\n\nequipment,  molds  and  dies.    A  serious  error  in  their\n\nappraisal could  by itself  easily be  an adequate  basis for\n\nfinding the appraisal to be materially in error.    \n\n     The  disparity  in the  price  predicted  and the  price\n\nrealized  for the molds and  dies is hardly  conclusive.  The\n\nauction might  not  have  been fair,  although  there  is  no\n\n                             -9-\n\nsuggestion  of that in this record.  Or conditions might have\n\nchanged  so materially  that no  negligence could  be imputed\n\nbased on the disparity;  in this instance, Crawford testified\n\nbriefly that market conditions had if anything improved.  But\n\na very large  and unexplained disparity offers  a prima facie\n\ncase of error in the appraisal and  at least some evidence of\n\nnegligence.\n\n     Whether  the  huge disparity  here  would  be sufficient\n\nevidence of negligence need not be decided, because there was\n\nfurther  evidence  that  cast  an unfavorable  light  on  the\n\nappraisal.  All of the Bevmar  molds and dies were located at\n\nBevmar's California  plant or at about  eight other locations\n\nwhere  they  were  held  by  Bevmar  subcontractors  to  make\n\nproducts  for Bevmar.   Schneider  testified that  he visited\n\neach of the nine  locations in making his appraisal  and then\n\nconsulted by  telephone with subcontractors and  others as to\n\nwhat they would pay if the molds and dies were sold.\n\n     But  Elcor's representative  testified that  after Elcor\n\nwon  the  bid  a year  later,  he  visited each  of  the nine\n\nlocations and found many  of the items in poor  condition, in\n\nsome cases  even unusable.   And a Bevmar  employee testified\n\nthat Schneider  had visited only three  of the subcontractors\n\nwhen doing his appraisal, had not even examined all the molds\n\nand dies  at these three stops,  and had been  told that some\n\nitems were missing.   There was testimony that the  molds and\n\n                             -10-\n\ndies were different and in different condition.  Against this\n\nbackground, a jury could have regarded Schneider's assignment\n\nof a uniform  figure to each of the 96  molds and dies (e.g.,\n                                                            \n\n$16,000  apiece if  auctioned)  as highly  suspicious and  as\n\nfurther evidence that Schneider had done a sloppy appraisal.\n\n     The deposition  testimony of  Schneider could  also have\n\nreinforced  a   jury's  judgment   that  the   appraisal  was\n\nnegligent.  His expert credentials were fairly  thin but, far\n\nworse, portions of his deposition transcript read to the jury\n\nwere  littered  with  the entry  \"no  response\"  when he  was\n\npressed  on the  puzzling uniformity  of figures  and related\n\nmatters.   There was no  real evidence of fraud  or of aiding\n\nand abetting  fraud, and we do  not fault the  trial court in\n\nwithdrawing this issue  from the jury.  Yet at  least some of\n\nthe evidence that plaintiffs  associate with fraud could have\n\nfurther undermined the jury's confidence in Schneider's skill\n\nand care.4\n\n     We  think  that  the  evidence recited  would  permit  a\n\nreasonable jury to conclude that Schneider's appraisal of the\n\nmolds and dies was erroneous  in the sense that it was  not a\n\n                    \n\n     4Schneider  relied  in   appraising  the  machinery  and\nequipment  located on the  East Coast on  photographs sent to\nhim  by a  Dovetech  employee  based  in Massachusetts.    He\napparently  knew  that Marik  was  seeking  a high  appraisal\nfigure.   And he  was associated,  although the  evidence was\nsomewhat confused, with a possible proposal in September 1989\nfor Ross-Dove itself to  offer $500,000 to Bevmar for  all of\nthe items in  question, the  same month in  which he  assured\nCrawford that the June 1989 appraisal was still valid.\n\n                             -11-\n\nresponsible estimate of value  and, further, to conclude that\n\nits preparation was negligent.  A jury might not so find, and\n\na strong defense case might make such findings less likely or\n\neven impossible.   Still, limiting ourselves  to the evidence\n\nas it stood at  the close of plaintiffs' case,  and resolving\n\ninferences  and   issue  of  credibility  in   favor  of  the\n\nplaintiffs,  we  think that  a  jury  that  found  error  and\n\nnegligence in the appraisal would not be irrational.\n\n     We turn  now to the  district court's discussion  of the\n\nmolds  and dies, a subject that the court fairly described as\n\ndifficult  and to which it gave careful attention.  The court\n\ngave three reasons for  disregarding the discrepancy  between\n\nappraisal and realized value.  The first was that Schneider's\n\nappraisal  was  based on  the market  value  of the  items as\n\nfunctioning molds  and dies whereas  the molds and  dies were\n\n(in the  district court's words) \"apparently  sold at auction\n\nas scrap,\" some being  operational and some not.   This, said\n\nthe court,  made a comparison between  predicted and realized\n\nprice of the items a comparison of apples and oranges.\n\n     With  respect, we think it might be more accurate to say\n\nthat Schneider  appraised the  molds and  dies as  apples but\n\nthey, or  some of them, turned out to be  oranges.  It is not\n\nclear what knowledge Elcor  had of the molds and  dies before\n\nthe auction.  The molds and dies seem to have been advertised\n\nfor auction as  operational, since pictures of the items they\n\n                             -12-\n\ncould produce were offered.  Having sold 96 molds and dies to\n\nBevmar  in 1986, Elcor may have supposed that it already knew\n\nwhat  it was  getting.   At the  same time,  Elcor's bid  was\n\ncertainly  very low  and may  be open  to the  inference that\n\nElcor knew that many of the items were scrap or little more.\n\n     No doubt, as the district court assumed, it  is implicit\n\nin Schneider's estimate  of $1.5 million  that the molds  and\n\ndies would be bought  for use, for $1.5 million  is obviously\n\nabove scrap  value.5   But  by  the  same token  it  is  also\n\nimplicit  in the appraisal that they were capable of such use\n\nand would normally be  so employed, absent a major  change in\n\nmarket conditions or in  the items themselves.  Yet  there is\n\nno evidence  that market conditions had changed  by July 1990\n\nor that  the items themselves had  unexpectedly deteriorated.\n\nIn sum,  a jury could  condemn Schneider  for appraising  the\n                                                             \n\nmolds  and  dies as  useful when  in  fact they  were largely\n                                                             \n\nscrap.\n     \n\n     Second, the  district court  observed that the  buyer of\n\nthe molds and dies  at the auction got  only 20 to 40  of the\n\nmolds and dies.  The court found these to be \"a far cry\" from\n\nthe 96 that were  appraised by Dovetech, the more  so because\n\nthe  court said  that the more  valuable ones  were excluded.\n\n                    \n\n     5Piletz, who appraised Bevmar's machinery  and equipment\nin   March  1989,   offered  an   informed  guess   based  on\nreproduction value--not an appraisal--that the molds and dies\n\"might\" sell for about $158,000 if sold as scrap and $634,000\nif sold for continued use.\n\n                             -13-\n\nThe  court  evidently   believed  that  the  discrepancy   in\n\nappraisal and  price might  have been explained  by the  fact\n\nthat Dovetech  was appraising  a more extensive  and valuable\n\ncollection of molds and dies than the subset that was finally\n\nbought by Elcor.\n\n     The evidence,  however, permitted the jury  to find that\n\nElcor bid  on  the list  of  96 molds  and  dies without  any\n\nknowledge  that  some  were  missing  or  owned  by  others.6\n\nFurther, Crawford's testimony that Elcor had found only 20 to\n\n40 dies is coupled with the statement that many were obsolete\n\nand \"[h]ad not been running for  years.\"  The jury could well\n\nhave  thought  that, whatever  the  number  owned by  Bevmar,\n\nSchneider had no business appraising such items at an average\n\nvalue apiece of $16,000 (auction) to $42,000 (in place).\n            \n\n     Third,  the  district   court  held  that  because   the\n\ndiscrepancy  reflected a difference  between market value and\n\nscrap  value,  plaintiffs  were  required  to  offer   expert\n\nevidence that  Schneider had erred in adopting a market value\n\napproach; absent  such expert  guidance, said the  court, the\n\njury would  be  left to  \"speculate\"  on which  approach  was\n\ncorrect.  Rhode Island law, even assuming that it controls on\n\nthis issue, does  not automatically require expert  testimony\n\n                    \n\n     6The 96 molds and dies were advertised as a lot, and the\nElcor   testimony  is   open  to   the  inference   that  its\nrepresentative was  surprised  when the  post-auction  survey\nrevealed fewer than had been promised.\n\n                             -14-\n\nto show negligence.  Murphy v.  United Steelworkers, 507 D.2d\n                                                   \n\n1342, 1345-46  (R.I. 1986).  But  we agree that,  if a choice\n\nwere  required   between  competing  concepts   of  value  or\n\ncompeting  techniques of  appraisal an  expert might  well be\n\nrequired.7\n\n     Here, however, the evidence permitted the jury to assume\n\nthat Schneider's concept  of market value  was proper but  to\n\nconclude that he  had negligently  assigned excessive  market\n\nvalues to many  of the molds and dies.   And we conclude that\n\nthe jury  was capable of appraising  the plaintiffs' evidence\n\nof  disparity and fault on its own, although expert testimony\n\nwould surely have been prudent and helpful.  There is nothing\n\nrecherche about the reasoning  behind the inferences based on\n\nthe  huge discrepancy  between  appraisal  and proceeds,  the\n\nsuspiciously uniform  estimates, and Schneider's  failure (if\n\nthe jury so found) to visit each of the sites and inspect the\n\nmolds.\n\n                  B.  Reliance and Causation\n                                            \n\n     This brings us to  the second element of  the negligence\n\ncause  of action for which the district court found a failure\n\n                    \n\n     7Piletz' deposition suggests that  he did believe that a\ndifferent  method  of  appraising  molds and  dies  than  the\ntelephone survey used  by Schneider  was called for.   It  is\nvery doubtful that Piletz' alternative approach was explained\nadequately to  permit the jury to  reject Schneider's method.\nBut plaintiffs' far better case was that Schneider had used a\npermissible method but botched  the job by failing to  do any\nadequate inspection or make adequate inquiry. \n\n                             -15-\n\nof proof, namely, justifiable reliance.   A bit of background\n\nis  required.    The   evidence  suggested  that  there  were\n\ndiscrepancies,  of  several  different  kinds,  between  what\n\nDovetech  appraised  and what  Bevmar  actually  owned.   The\n\nmissing molds  and dies and uncertainties  about ownership of\n\nothers have  already been mentioned.   It  also appears  that\n\nsome of the machinery and equipment in the appraisal may have\n\nbelonged  to a Rhode Island  state entity but  was counted in\n\nthe appraisal.      The  district  court   found  a  lack  of\n\njustifiable reliance  because, it said,  the plaintiffs  were\n\nnot entitled  to  rely on  the  appraisal to  establish  that\n\nBevmar owned the  items appraised.   To the  extent that  the\n\nitems  were  not  owned  by Bevmar,  naturally  the  security\n\ninterest in Bevmar's inventory of equipment, machinery, molds\n\nand  dies  had  a  reduced  value.    Therefore,   the  court\n\nconcluded, \"the evidence  establishes as a matter of law that\n\nthere  was  no  justifiable  reliance  on  the  appraisal  to\n\nestablish the expected security interest in these assets.\"\n\n     Plaintiffs  concede that  the  ownership  of  the  items\n\nappraised  was not within the scope of the representations in\n\nthe appraisal.  At most,  the appraisal purported to appraise\n\nproperty at Bevmar's facilities or, in the case of some molds\n\nand  dies,  property  Bevmar  claimed to  have  lent  to  its\n\nsubcontractors.   Thus it is true  that plaintiffs would have\n\nno case if  their cause  of action depended  on showing  that\n\n                             -16-\n\nthey  reasonably  relied  upon  the  appraisal  to  establish\n\nBevmar's title.   It seems  to us that  plaintiffs' cause  of\n\naction, specifically the showing of reliance and injury, does\n\nnot depend on such a showing.\n\n     The problem is confused  because plaintiffs in this case\n\nhave been somewhat fuzzy  in their theory of damages.   It is\n\noften attractive for a  plaintiff with evidence of wrongdoing\n\nand evidence of loss  to throw the evidence  to the jury  and\n\nhope  that the jury  will make a causal  connection.  In this\n\ncase  plaintiffs had  available  two different  theories, and\n\nthere are hints of both in  its pleadings and arguments.  One\n\ntheory is  that, but  for the misappraisal,  plaintiffs would\n\nnot  have invested  at all  and would  still have  their $3.5\n\nmillion; the other is that their security interest would have\n\nbeen worth more if the appraisal had been accurate.\n\n     Plaintiffs offered  their  own testimony  on  the  first\n\ntheory,  namely, that they  would not  have made  the initial\n\ninvestment if they had known that the assets in question were\n\nworth  far  less  than  the  appraisal   said.8    From  this\n\nstandpoint,  it does not matter whether some of the assets in\n\nquestion   belonged   to   Rhode    Island   or   to   Bevmar\n\n                    \n\n     8The testimony on this issue is not crystal clear but it\nwas adequate  for the jury  to draw  such a conclusion.   And\ngiven  the  importance the  Crawford  group  attached to  the\nappraisal,  evidenced by  other facts  (e.g., the  inquiry to\n                                            \nSchneider   and   a   separate   inquiry   into   Ross-Dove's\nreputation), the conclusion is eminently plausible.\n\n                             -17-\n\nsubcontractors.  If  plaintiffs' testimony is accepted,  then\n\nthe mistaken appraisal \"caused\" the loss in the familiar \"but\n\nfor\" sense:   but for  the mistake,  the loss would  not have\n\noccurred.  (We defer for the moment questions of  intervening\n\ncause.)  The  validity of the security  agreement simply does\n\nnot matter.\n\n     Its  validity  very  much  does  matter  on  the  second\n\npossible theory of injury, namely, that the misrepresentation\n\ncaused  loss insofar  as  it  overstated  the  value  of  the\n\nsecurity  interest,  reducing plaintiffs'  protection  in the\n\nevent  of bankruptcy.   On  this  theory, any  misestimate of\n\nvalue would indeed be  harmless as to those assets  that were\n                                                             \n\nmisappraised  but  were not  owned  by Bevmar.    Whether one\n                                             \n\nspeaks of unjustified reliance  or lack of causal connection,\n\nplaintiffs' damage  claims would be  proportionately reduced.\n\nPerhaps any damage  recovery on this  second theory might  be\n           \n\nspeculative on  this  record;9 but  we  need not  decide  the\n\npoint  for there  is nothing  obviously wrong with  the first\n\ntheory as a basis for getting to the jury.\n\n     Defendants on  appeal offer  a different argument  as to\n\nwhy  Crawford's  reliance  on  the  appraisal  could  not  be\n\njustifiable reliance.   They argue that the  appraisal by its\n\n                    \n\n     9Arguably, it  would  be plaintiffs'  responsibility  to\nshow  which assets  were owned  by Bevmar  and the  extent to\nwhich, as to those assets, the appraisal figure  exceeded the\nprice  received at auction.  It is unclear whether the record\npermits such an allocation.\n\n                             -18-\n\nterms required the  consent of  Dovetech before  it could  be\n\ndistributed  to third parties other than Marik and Bevmar and\n\nthat, at least implicitly, this caveat made reliance on it by\n\nthird party investors unreasonable.   This view, if accepted,\n\nwould  undercut both  of  plaintiffs'  possible  theories  of\n\ninjury.  It was not adopted  by the district court as a basis\n\nfor the directed verdict.\n\n     There was evidence at trial that Dovetech  knew that its\n\nappraisal would  be distributed to financing  sources such as\n\nplaintiffs.   Crawford also testified that  he told Schneider\n\nthat  he  (Crawford) and  others were  going  to rely  on the\n\nappraisal in making their investment and Schneider reaffirmed\n\nits  validity.   Piletz testified  that appraisers  know that\n\ntheir work will be relied  on by third parties.  Thus  a jury\n\nmight  find that,  even if  the appraisal  caveat is  read as\n\ndefendants urge,  Dovetech had  waived its protection  or had\n\ntreated the Crawford group as  among those for whose  benefit\n\nthe appraisal had been done.\n\n      Finally we turn to the district  court's third and last\n\nreason  for its directed  verdict, which can  be described as\n\naccepting an \"intervening cause\" defense.  The district court\n\nfound  that the lists of assets appraised by Dovetech did not\n\nmatch  the list  of assets  included in  plaintiffs' security\n\nagreement filing;  that attorneys acting in  some measure for\n\nplaintiffs  disbursed plaintiffs' money at the closing before\n\n                             -19-\n\ncertain of plaintiffs'  conditions were  satisfied; and  that\n\nthe  bankruptcy trustee  had challenged  the validity  of the\n\nplaintiffs'  security  interest  in  the  pending  bankruptcy\n\nproceedings   (a  challenge  that  has  now  apparently  been\n\ndropped).\n\n     The  first and  last  of these  \"intervening causes\"  of\n\ninjury are  irrelevant so  far as  the plaintiffs proceed  on\n\ntheir first theory of recovery: as already shown, that theory\n\ndoes  not depend on the validity of the security agreement at\n\nall.   The  remaining \"intervening  cause\" is  the attorneys'\n\nalleged  failure to insist at the closing that other promised\n\nthird-party  investments in  Bevmar  be  committed  and  that\n\ncertain  liens  against  its  property  be  satisfied.    The\n\ndistrict court's conclusion may  rest on the assumption that,\n\nif  the client  instructions  had been  followed, either  the\n\ninitial $3 million would  never have been paid over  or, less\n\nlikely, the conditions if  satisfied would have prevented the\n\nfailure of Bevmar.\n\n     There  was some  evidence  of  the  attorneys'  supposed\n\ndisregard  of   instructions,  but  very  little   about  the\n\nsignificance or consequences of such disregard.  Rhode Island\n\nlaw  is  not  especially  friendly to  an  intervening  cause\n\ndefense,  nor  especially  precise;  and  a  jury  instructed\n\n                             -20-\n\naccording  to the  state's case  law might  have considerable\n\nlatitude.10    Measured  against  such language,  we  do  not\n\nthink  that the  evidence presented  as to  counsel's alleged\n\nmistake at the  closing compelled  a jury to  decide that  an\n                                 \n\nintervening cause was responsible  for the plaintiffs'  loss.\n\nWhether in  presenting their  defense defendants  could offer\n\nmore powerful evidence on this point is another matter.\n\n                       III.  CONCLUSION\n\n     To sum up, we  agree with the district court  that there\n\nwas  insufficient evidence of fraud to submit that claim to a\n\njury.  But in our view the jury did have sufficient evidence,\n\njudged at the close of the plaintiffs' case, to find material\n\nerror  in the  appraisal and  negligence in  its preparation.\n\nWhile plaintiffs  may face  hurdles on issues  of justifiable\n\nreliance,  causation,  and  damages,  we  think  for  reasons\n\nexplained  above that  a  directed verdict  on those  grounds\n\ncannot be justified at this stage.\n\n                    \n\n     10Thus,  \"an   intervening  act  will  not   insulate  a\ndefendant from  liability if his negligence  was a concurring\nproximate cause which had not been  rendered remote by reason\nof  the  secondary  cause  which  intervened.\"    Roberts  v.\n                                                         \nKettelle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2311691\"><a href=\"/opinion/2311691/roberts-v-kettelle/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (R.I. 1976).

On  the\n\nother hand, the defense may  be able in its own case  to do a\n\nbetter  job   of  explaining  the  discrepancy   between  the\n\nappraisal  and  auction  price  of  the  96  molds  and  dies\n\nappraised  by  Schneider.
