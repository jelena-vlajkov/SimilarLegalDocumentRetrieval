This  appeal  raises  the\r                                              \n\nquestion  of  the   proper  time  to  commence   the  statute  of\n\nlimitations  period in an action challenging  a bank's failure to\n\ndischarge a mortgage.  Plaintiffs contend that the district court\n\nstarted  the clock  prematurely, and  thus wrongly  dismissed the\n\ncase as time-barred.\n\n     The facts, drawn from the complaint, are as follows.  In the\n\nsummer  of  1989, plaintiffs  Kevin  and  Linda  Price began  the\n\nprocess of building  a house on Lot 10 of  a subdivided parcel of\n\nland  they owned  in Deerfield, New  Hampshire.   Arlington Trust\n\nCompany, the  predecessor in interest to  defendant Shawmut Bank,\n\nheld a $250,000 mortgage on the entire property.  To finance  the\n\nconstruction, the Prices obtained a $100,000 loan from Rockingham\n\nCounty Trust Co., which was secured by a mortgage specifically on\n\nLot  10.  The Prices allege that, before signing with Rockingham,\n\nthey  elicited  an  oral promise  from  Arlington  that it  would\n\ndischarge  its mortgage on Lot 10  in exchange for $30,000 of the\n\n$100,000 Rockingham loan.\n\n     The  plaintiffs paid  the  $30,000 to  Arlington in  October\n\n1989.    Sometime  thereafter, as  a  result  of  a title  search\n\nconducted in connection with the sale of the house on Lot 10, the\n\nPrices learned that the  mortgage had not been discharged.   They\n\nhired an attorney, who  made multiple demands for release  of the\n\nmortgage  on  Shawmut, which  by  then  had acquired  Arlington's\n\nassets and liabilities.  On  both February 14 and March 6,  1990,\n\nShawmut, in writing, refused to do so.\r\n\n     Further discussion  ensued and, in April,  Shawmut agreed to\n\nsubordinate  its  mortgage  to  Rockingham's   construction  loan\n\nmortgage.  Rockingham foreclosed on Lot 10 in June 1990.  Shawmut\n\nforeclosed on the remainder of the property about a year later.\n\n     The Prices filed this lawsuit  on March 23, 1993,  asserting\n\nvarious  claims arising  from the  bank's failure to  provide the\n\nmortgage  discharge.   The district  court dismissed  the action,\n\nholding that  the three-year statute of  limitations contained in\n\nN.H.  Rev.  Stat. Ann.     508:4 began  to  run  when the  Prices\n\n\"learned  that there was an encumbrance on Lot 10 which Arlington\n\nhad  wrongfully failed  to remove.\"   The  court found  that this\n\noccurred, according  to the  allegations in the  complaint, \"well\n\nmore than three years before they commenced this action.\"\n\n     On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the district court selected\n\nthe  wrong point in time  to begin the  limitations period.  They\n\nassert that the injury  occurred, and the statute  began running,\n\nonly when  Rockingham foreclosed on  Lot 10 in June  1990.  Until\n\nthat time,  plaintiffs maintain,  Shawmut could have  changed its\n\nposition  and issued  the discharge that  would have  allowed the\n\nsale of the house to proceed smoothly.\n\n     We agree with the district court that the limitations period\n\ncommenced when the Prices learned that Arlington had not complied\n\nwith  its alleged  promise  to discharge  the  Lot 10  lien  upon\n\nreceipt of  the $30,000.*  Unquestionably,  the agreement between\n                    \r                              \n\n     *  The complaint  indicates that  this probably  occurred in\nlate  1989 but, in any event, in February 1990 when Shawmut first\ninformed  the Prices in writing  that it would  not discharge the\n\n                               -3-\r\n\nthe Prices and  Arlington was breached  when Arlington failed  to\n\nrelease  Lot 10 from the  mortgage shortly after  the Prices made\n\ntheir  payment.  The breach  had an immediate  impact: it clouded\n\nthe  Prices' title to Lot  10, stalling the ongoing purchase-and-\n\nsale process, and caused the Prices to hire an attorney to pursue\n\nthe  issue.   Indeed,  the causes  of  action asserted  in  their\n\ncomplaint center on Shawmut's  failure to discharge the mortgage,\n\nnot on  the  subordination of  its  mortgage and  the  subsequent\n\nforeclosures.\n\n     During  the negotiations  in late 1989  and early  1990, the\n\nPrices  undoubtedly hoped  that  they could  persuade Shawmut  to\n\ngrant the release.   That  the irrevocable injury  did not  occur\n\nuntil Rockingham foreclosed in  June, however, does not eradicate\n\nthe injury that occurred  as soon as Arlington failed  to release\n\nthe  mortgage upon receipt of  the Prices' payment.   See Rowe v.\r                                                                        \n\nJohn  Deere,  533 A.2d  375, 376-78,  130  N.H. 18,  21-23 (1987)\r                     \n\n(limitations period commences at time of initial injury, not at a\n\nlater  date  when  plaintiff  learned  the  full  extent  of  his\n\ninjuries).  Plaintiffs' theory comes down to saying that, so long\n\nas an injury  remains reversible through  successful negotiation,\n\nit  has not  accrued.   Such  would  indeed defeat  the  policies\n\nunderlying limitations statutes.\n\n     Moreover, even  when their lack of  success became apparent,\n\nthe  Prices still  had more  than two  and one-half  years during\n\nwhich  they could have  filed a timely lawsuit.   As the district\n                    \r                              \n\nmortgage. \n\n                               -4-\r\n\ncourt ruled, \"[t]heir  failure to do so . . .  serves as a bar to\n\ntheir present claims.\"\n\n     Affirmed.\r                       \n\n                               -5-\r\n",
