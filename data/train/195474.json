See U.S.S.G.   2D1.1, comment.  (backg'd.) (Nov. 1993)\n              \n\n(hereinafter, \"Amendment 488\").  As  the Commission provided that\n\nAmendment 488 may be given retroactive effect consistent  with 18\n\nU.S.C.   3582(c)(2),2 see United States v. Boot,     F.3d     ,  \n                                                                 \n\n (1st Cir. 1994) [No. 93-2317, slip op. at 3-4 (1st Cir.  June 7,\n\n1994)],  the district  court later  reduced the LSD  quantity for\n\nGuidelines sentencing purposes from 6.25 grams to 0.36 of a gram,\n\nand the GSR to 21-27 months, but did not  reduce Dimeo's sentence\n\nbelow the five-year MMS, and Dimeo appealed.3 \n\n                    \n\n     2Section 3582(c)(2) provides that the district court, on its\nown motion,  may reduce a  sentence imposed under  the Sentencing\n                \nGuidelines if  \"such a  reduction is  consistent with  applicable\n             \npolicy  statements  issued  by the  Sentencing  Commission.\"   18\nU.S.C.   3582(c)(2).  \n\n     3On November  1, 1993,  the United  States Probation  Office\nrecommended a reduction in Dimeo's guideline sentence pursuant to\nAmendment  488 but advised against any reduction in the five-year\nMMS.  The  district court received no input from  the parties and\nconducted no  hearing.  Dimeo's  former counsel, even  though not\nreappointed  until after  the  district  court  had  entered  its\n           \nrevised  sentence  on  November  15,  1993, nevertheless  alertly\ncontacted the  clerk of the  district court on October  27, 1993,\ninquiring as  to the procedure  for resolving issues  relating to\nany  reduction  in Dimeo's  sentence.   For whatever  reason, the\nrecord on  appeal reflects no  written or oral  presentation from\nDimeo in the  district court either before or  after the sentence\nreduction.  Thus,  the claims Dimeo asserts on  appeal were never\npresented to the  district court, and are deemed  waived.  United\n                                                                 \nStates  v. Elwell,  984 F.2d  1289, 1298  (1st Cir.)

Even if  these claims  were not\n\ndeemed waived  in the  district court for  failure to  raise them\n\neither before or  after entry of the revised  judgment, see supra\n                                                                 \n\nnote 3, they fail for other reasons.  \n\n          A  sentence  reduction  pursuant  to Amendment  488  is\n\nexpressly conditioned on conformance with 18 U.S.C.   3582(c)(2),\n\nwhich confers  no power on the district court to reduce a minimum\n\nsentence mandated by statute.  Furthermore, as discussed in Boot,\n                                                                \n\nslip op.  at 7, a MMS reduction  would exceed the power conferred\n\nupon  the district court under 18  U.S.C.   3582(c)(2), see supra\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\nraised in  district court are  waived), cert. denied, 113  S.

We  note, further, that the constitutional chal-\nlenge belatedly  asserted  by appellant  may entail  considerable\nrisk.

(backg'd.) (Nov.1993), defendant Paul Dimeo appealed the revised sentence on the ground that the district court erred in not reducing the prison term below the minimum mandated by statute.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Dimeo pled guilty to conspiring to distribute more than one gram of lysergic acid diethylamide (\"LSD\").  See 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.  For purposes of determining both the statutory mandatory minimum sentence (\"MMS\"), see 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B)(v) (prescribing five-year MMS for distributing \"1 gram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of [LSD]\"), and the applicable Guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\"), see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c) (Nov.1991),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the district court included the entire weight of the paper carrier medium used in distributing the 900 LSD doses.  See Chapman v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112605\"><a href=\"/opinion/112605/chapman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112605\"><a href=\"/opinion/112605/chapman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span> </a></span>(1991) (construing \"mixture or substance,\" in 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b), as \"requir[ing] the weight of the carrier medium to be included\").  The 63-month prison term originally imposed under the Guidelines (BOL:  26;  CHC:  I;  GSR:  63-78 months) trumped the five-year MMS under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(B)(v) for distributing one gram or more of LSD.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5G1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Effective November 1, 1993, however, the Sentencing Commission amended U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 944(p), by prescribing a less stringent (0.4 milligram per-dose) formula for calculating LSD quantity than the regime previously upheld in Chapman.   See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1, comment.  (backg'd.) (Nov.1993) (hereinafter, \"Amendment 488\").  As the Commission provided that Amendment 488 may be given retroactive effect consistent with 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> see United States v. Boot, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670675\"><a href=\"/opinion/670675/united-states-v-christopher-lee-boot/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.1994), the district court later reduced the LSD quantity for Guidelines sentencing purposes from 6.25 grams to 0.36 of a gram, and the GSR to 21-27 months, but did not reduce Dimeo's sentence below the five-year MMS, and Dimeo appealed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dimeo claims for the first time that by permitting Amendment 488 to take effect Congress signaled its intention that LSD weight be calculated under a unitary method for both GSR and MMS purposes, thereby implicitly overruling Chapman.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Further, also for the first time, Dimeo asserts a constitutional challenge to the coexistence of these two divergent regimes for determining LSD quantity, as violative of due process and equal protection.  Even if these claims were not deemed waived in the district court for failure to raise them either before or after entry of the revised judgment, see supra note 3, they fail for other reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 488 is expressly conditioned on conformance with 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c)(2), which confers no power on the district court to reduce a minimum sentence mandated by statute.  Furthermore, as discussed in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670675\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Boot,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/670675/united-states-v-christopher-lee-boot/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, a MMS reduction would exceed the power conferred upon the district court under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3582(c)(2), see supra note 2, since it would be inconsistent with the Sentencing Commission policy statement accompanying Amendment 488:  \"Nonetheless, this [new Guidelines] approach does not override the applicability of 'mixture or substance' for the purpose of applying any mandatory minimum sentence (see Chapman;  Sec. 5G1.1(b)).\"   U.S.S.G.

Sec. 3582(c)(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> On November 1, 1993, the United States Probation Office recommended a reduction in Dimeo's guideline sentence pursuant to Amendment 488 but advised against any reduction in the five-year MMS.  The district court received no input from the parties and conducted no hearing.  Dimeo's former counsel, even though not reappointed until after the district court had entered its revised sentence on November 15, 1993, nevertheless alertly contacted the clerk of the district court on October 27, 1993, inquiring as to the procedure for resolving issues relating to any reduction in Dimeo's sentence.  For whatever reason, the record on appeal reflects no written or oral presentation from Dimeo in the district court either before or after the sentence reduction.  Thus, the claims Dimeo asserts on appeal were never presented to the district court, and are deemed waived.  United States v. Elwell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599256\"><a href=\"/opinion/599256/united-states-v-david-elwell-united-states-v-hobart-willis-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1298 (1st Cir.)

We note, further, that the constitutional challenge belatedly asserted by appellant may entail considerable risk.  Chapman conclusively establishes the constitutionality of the \"mixture or substance\" methodology for MMS purposes.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670675\"><a href=\"/opinion/670675/united-states-v-christopher-lee-boot/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Were a </a></span>court to conclude that the \"mixture or substance\" methodology and the 0.4 milligram per-dose formula cannot coexist constitutionally, it seems virtually certain that Amendment 488, rather than the \"mixture or substance\" methodology upheld in Chapman, would be struck down, and with it the Guidelines sentence reduction.
