Ms. Marjorie Blevio (\"Blevio\")\n                                \n\nbrought a  declaratory judgment action, as  administratrix of the\n\nestate of  her thirteen-year-old  son Noah Blevio,  against Aetna\n\nCasualty &amp;  Surety Company (\"Aetna\") and  Royal Insurance Company\n\nof  America,   Inc.  (\"Royal\"),  to  determine   the  rights  and\n\nliabilities of the parties under two motor vehicle underinsurance\n\npolicies.  The parties  filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nThe  disposition of these motions turned on the issue of whether,\n\nunder  the law  of Connecticut,  two insurers,  who each  provide\n\nunderinsured motorist coverage to a party injured in an accident,\n\ncan each  set off in full, from the limits of their coverage, the\n\namount  of   the  recovery   obtained  from  the   party  legally\n\nresponsible for the accident.  The district court found that each\n\ninsurer  was  not  entitled to  set  off  the  recovery from  the\n\ntortfeasor in full, but  rather that the two insurers  could only\n\ndeduct   the  amount   of  the   recovery  from   the  aggregated\n\nunderinsured  motorist  coverage  limits.     For  the  following\n\nreasons, we affirm.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n          A.  Facts\n\n          The  parties do not dispute the  material facts of this\n\ncase.  Noah  Blevio died on August  9, 1991, from fatal  injuries\n\nsustained  when he was  hit by a  pickup truck on  June 30, 1991.\n\nThe combined limits of  the tortfeasors' applicable bodily injury\n\nliability policies totalled $200,000.  This amount was offered to\n\nBlevio.\n\n                               -2-\n\n          In  addition, Noah  Blevio  had  underinsured  motorist\n\ncoverage up to $500,000 under  his father's Aetna business policy\n\nand  up to  $300,000  under his  brother's  Royal policy.    Both\n\npolicies provided that their underinsured motorist coverage shall\n\nbe reduced by the amounts  paid by, or on behalf of,  the legally\n\nresponsible party.  Specifically, the uninsured motorist coverage\n\nendorsement of the Aetna Policy provides:\n\n            A.  Coverage\n\n            1.  We will pay all sums the \"insured\" is\n            legally  entitled  to recover  as damages\n            from the owner or driver of an \"uninsured\n            motor vehicle\"1 . . .\n\n            D.  Limit of Insurance\n\n                               ***\n\n            2.     Any  amount  payable   under  this\n            coverage shall be reduced by:\n\n                               ***\n\n            b.  All sums paid by or for anyone who is\n            legally responsible. . . . \n\nThe uninsured  motorist coverage  provisions of the  Royal policy\n\nprovide:\n\n            A.    We  will pay  compensatory  damages\n            which an \"insured\" is legally entitled to\n            recover from the owner or  operator of an\n            \"uninsured  motor   vehicle\"  because  of\n            \"bodily injury,\"\n\n            1.  Sustained by an \"insured,\" and \n\n                    \n\n1  The  Aetna policy  defines an \"uninsured  motor vehicle\" as  a\nmotor  vehicle  that is  underinsured, in  that  \"the sum  of all\nliability bonds or policies at the time of an 'accident' provides\nat  least  the amounts  required by  the  applicable law  where a\ncovered 'auto' is principally  garaged but that sum is  less than\nthe Limit of Insurance of this coverage.\"\n\n                               -3-\n\n            2.  Caused by an accident . . . .\n\nIn  addition,  the  endorsement  attached to  the  Royal  policy,\n\nentitled   \"Amendment  of   Policy  Provisions   -  Connecticut,\"\n\nprovides:\n\n            II.  Uninsured Motorists Coverage2\n\n            Part C is amended as follows:\n\n                               ***\n\n            E.   The Limit of Liability  provision is\n            replaced by the following:\n\n            Limit of Liability\n\n                               ***\n\n            The limit of  liability shall be  reduced\n            by all sums:\n\n            1.  Paid  because of the  \"bodily injury\"\n            by   or   on   behalf   of   persons   or\n            organizations   who    may   be   legally\n            responsible . . . .\n\n          The parties do not dispute that the legally responsible\n\nparties  were  underinsured and  that  the underinsured  motorist\n\ncoverage  provided  under  Aetna's   and  Royal's  policies   are\n\napplicable to Blevio's claims.   Nor do the parties  dispute that\n\nAetna and  Royal  are entitled  to  a  setoff by  virtue  of  the\n\nexistence of the legally responsible  parties' liability payment.\n\nRather, the only issue is the extent to which liability insurance\n\npayments made on the tortfeasor's behalf can be set  off.  Blevio\n\n                    \n\n2  The Royal  policy defines \"uninsured motor vehicle\" as a motor\nvehicle \"[f]or which the sum of the limits of liability under all\nbodily injury liability bonds or policies  applicable at the time\nof the accident  is less than the sum of  the limits of liability\nfor  Uninsured  Motorists  Coverage  applicable  to  each vehicle\ninsured for this coverage under this policy.\"\n\n                               -4-\n\ncontends  that Aetna and Royal can only share one $200,000 setoff\n\nequal  to the amount that  Blevio will actually  collect from the\n\ntortfeasors.   Both Aetna and Royal claim, however, that they are\n\neach  entitled  to  deduct  the  tortfeasors' $200,000  liability\n\npayment  in  order  to  give   full  effect  to  their   separate\n\nunderinsurance setoff provisions,  thereby reducing the aggregate\n\nunderinsurance  coverage  available  to Blevio  from  $800,000 to\n\n$400,000.3\n\n          B.  Procedural History\n\n          Blevio filed a declaratory  judgment action on June 11,\n\n1993,  asking that  the district  court determine  the extent  to\n\nwhich Aetna and  Royal are entitled to set off  the limits of the\n\navailable  bodily injury liability coverage from the underinsured\n\nmotorist  coverage of  their  respective policies.   Blevio  then\n\nfiled  a \"Motion  for Judgment  on the  Pleadings or  for Summary\n\nJudgment.\"  Aetna and Royal cross-moved for summary judgment.\n\n          After a hearing,  the district  court entered  judgment\n\nfor Blevio.  The district court advised Aetna and Royal, however,\n\nthat   because, at the  time, no Connecticut  appellate court had\n\ndirectly addressed  the issue, and  a split of  authority existed\n\nbetween  two   Connecticut  Superior  Court  decisions  that  had\n\naddressed  the issue, it would certify the issue presented to the\n\nSupreme Court of Connecticut upon their request.  Aetna and Royal\n\n                    \n\n3  Pursuant to the terms of the insurance contracts, the issue of\nwhether Blevio is  legally entitled  to recover, and  if so,  the\namount  of damages, are subject to  arbitration.  Arbitration has\nnot  yet commenced, but will take place after a final decision in\nthis case.\n\n                               -5-\n\nthen filed an \"Ex  Parte Motion for Certification of  Question of\n\nLaw.\"   The  district  court vacated  the  judgment in  favor  of\n\nBlevio,  and  allowed  certification  to  the  Supreme  Court  of\n\nConnecticut.    The Supreme  Court  of  Connecticut declined  the\n\ncertification request.  On February 24, 1994,  the district court\n\nthen  entered final judgment in favor of Blevio and against Aetna\n\nand Royal.  Aetna and Royal now appeal.\n\n            II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW\n                                                      \n\n          Our  review of  the district  court's grant  of summary\n\njudgment  is plenary.  Alan Corp.  v. International Surplus Lines\n                                                                 \n\nIns. Co., 22 F.3d 339, 341 (1st Cir. 1994).   Where, as here, the\n        \n\nparties do not dispute  the facts upon which coverage  is allowed\n\nor  denied under an insurance policy, and the existence or amount\n\nof coverage depends solely  upon a construction of the  policy, a\n\nquestion of law is  presented.  Id. at 342  (citing Atlas Pallet,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.  v.  Gallagher,  725   F.2d  131,  134  (1st   Cir.  1984)).\n                   \n\nTherefore,  like other questions of law,  we are not bound by the\n\ndistrict court's  interpretation of the  policy.  Alan  Corp., 22\n                                                             \n\nF.3d at 342.\n\n          The   parties  do  not  dispute  that  Connecticut  law\n\napplies.   In  interpreting  Connecticut  law, we  are  bound  by\n\nintermediate appellate state court decisions construing state law\n\nunless we are convinced that the highest court of the state would\n\ndecide otherwise.  Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S. 456,\n                                                  \n\n465 (1967); Ground Air Transfer, Inc. v. Westates Airlines, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n899 F.2d  1269, 1275 (1st  Cir. 1990); see  Cola v. Reardon,  787\n                                                           \n\n                               -6-\n\nF.2d 681, 688  n.5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  479 U.S. 930 (1986)\n                                           \n\n(stating  that the  First  Circuit was  bound  to apply  a  state\n\nappellate court's statement of local  law).   We note that  since\n\nthe district court issued  its decision in the present  case, the\n\nConnecticut Court  of Appeals  has released a  decision, Allstate\n                                                                 \n\nIns.  Co. v.  Link,  645 A.2d  1052 (Conn.  App. Ct.  1994), that\n                  \n\nresolves the question involved  in this appeal.  Because  we have\n\nno reason to believe that the Connecticut Supreme Court would not\n\nreach a similar result, we are bound to apply this decision.4\n\n                          III.  ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n          Connecticut law requires that each automobile liability\n\ninsurance  policy provide  uninsured  motorist coverage  for  the\n\nprotection of  persons insured  thereunder  against operators  of\n\nuninsured and underinsured motor vehicles.5   See Conn. Gen.  St.\n                                                 \n\n  38a-336(a).   The statute requires  that each policy  provide a\n\nminimum  level of uninsured/underinsured motorist protection, but\n\nalso  prevents an  insured from  obtaining  a double  recovery of\n\ndamages.  See Buell v. American Universal Ins. Co., 621 A.2d 262,\n                                                  \n\n266-67 (Conn. 1993).\n\n            An insurance company  shall be  obligated\n            to make payment to  its insured up to the\n            limits of the policy's uninsured motorist\n            coverage  after  the limits  of liability\n            under all bodily  injury liability  bonds\n\n                    \n\n4   On September 20,  1994, the Connecticut  Supreme Court denied\nAllstate Insurance's petition  for certification  to appeal  from\nAllstate Ins. Co. v. Link, 645 A.2d 1052 (Conn. App. Ct. 1994).\n                         \n\n5   Statutory provisions applying to  uninsured motorist coverage\napply equally  to underinsured motorist coverage.   Covenant Ins.\n                                                                 \nCo. v. Coon, 594 A.2d 977, 978 n.3 (Conn. 1991).  \n           \n\n                               -7-\n\n            or insurance policies  applicable at  the\n            time of the  accident have been exhausted\n            by payment of  judgments or  settlements,\n            but in no event shall the total amount of\n            recovery from all policies, including any\n            amount  recovered   under  the  insured's\n            uninsured  motorist coverage,  exceed the\n            limits   of   the   insured's   uninsured\n            motorist coverage.\n\nConn.  Gen. St.     38a-336(b).   Correspondingly, the  insurance\n\ncommissioner has adopted a regulation that provides, in pertinent\n\npart,  that an insurance policy \"may provide for the reduction of\n\nlimits [of  underinsured motorist  liability] to the  extent that\n\ndamages  have been  . .  . paid  by or  on  behalf of  any person\n\nresponsible for the injury . . . .\"  Conn. Agencies Regs.    38a-\n\n334-6(d)(1).  The Aetna and Royal policies' underinsured motorist\n\ncoverage provisions contain  language that essentially  track the\n\nConnecticut  law, and  provide  that  their  policies'  liability\n\nlimits shall be reduced by any sum paid by, or for, anyone who is\n\nlegally responsible.\n\n          As noted  above, the  Connecticut Court of  Appeals has\n\nrecently construed Conn. Agencies Regs.    38(a)-334-6(d)(1), and\n\naddressed  the situation  of setoffs in  the context  of multiple\n\nunderinsured motorist coverage in Allstate  Ins. Co. v. Link, 645\n                                                            \n\nA.2d 1052 (Conn. App. Ct. 1994).   The Court of Appeals held that\n\nmultiple insurers providing underinsured  motorist coverage to an\n\ninsured cannot each  setoff in  full the amount  of the  recovery\n\nfrom the tortfeasor.   Id. at 1058.  In   Allstate Ins. Co., Link\n                                                           \n\nwas injured when the automobile  she was driving was struck by  a\n\nvehicle operated by a tortfeasor.  Id. at 1054.  The tortfeasor's\n                                     \n\n                               -8-\n\ninsurance company paid $100,000 to Link, exhausting the limits of\n\nthe tortfeasor's bodily injury  liability coverage.  Id.   At the\n                                                       \n\ntime of the accident, Link held two separate automobile insurance\n\npolicies with Allstate.  Id.  One policy provided for $200,000 of\n                           \n\nuninsured/underinsured  motorist coverage,  and the  other policy\n\nprovided  for $400,000  of  such coverage.    Id.   Link  claimed\n                                                \n\nunderinsured motorist benefits under  both policies.  Id.   After\n                                                        \n\narbitration,  the  Connecticut  Superior  Court  found  that  the\n\ntortfeasor  was  underinsured,  and  that Link  was  entitled  to\n\nunderinsured  motorist benefits  from each  of the  two policies.\n\nId.   The  court   determined  that   the  amount   of  available\n  \n\nunderinsured motorist coverage was $600,000, but that each policy\n\nshould  have  deducted from  its  cumulative  limit  the  sum  of\n\n$100,000 previously  paid  by the  tortfeasor.   Id. at  1054-55.\n                                                   \n\nLink  appealed, claiming  that the  court improperly  reduced the\n\namount  of  underinsured  motorist  benefits awarded  to  her  by\n\ncrediting Allstate with twice the amount actually paid out by the\n\ntortfeasor, thus  creating a  windfall to Allstate  and depriving\n\nLink  of a payment of $100,000 due  her that she did not receive.\n\nId. at 1057.\n  \n\n          The Connecticut Court of  Appeals agreed and found that\n\nLink  was entitled  to  have available  a  total of  $600,000  in\n\nunderinsured motorist  benefits under the two  Allstate policies.\n\nId. at 1057-58.   While noting that no Connecticut  Supreme Court\n  \n\ncase had specifically addressed this issue,  the Court of Appeals\n\nstated  that some related  cases had implied  that a tortfeasor's\n\n                               -9-\n\ncontribution  should be  shared among  the policies  covering the\n\ninsured.  Id. at 1057.  The court stated:\n            \n\n            The  amount   of  damages  paid   by  the\n            tortfeasor may reduce the total amount of\n            underinsured motorist benefits  available\n            to  a claimant.   It  may not  reduce the\n            amounts paid out by each policy.  To hold\n            otherwise would mean that an award due an\n            insured is reduced  unfairly by twice the\n            amount actually paid out by  or on behalf\n            of the  tortfeasor and that an insured is\n            entitled   to  double   the  tortfeasor's\n            credit   merely   by   issuing   separate\n            policies.    Such   a  result  would   be\n            unfairly detrimental to the insured.\n\nId. at  1058.   The court then  concluded that from  the $600,000\n  \n\ntotal, Allstate should have been  credited with only the $100,000\n\nactually paid by the tortfeasor.  Id.\n                                    \n\n          A similar result is mandated here.  Blevio was entitled\n\nto  an  aggregate  of  up to  $800,000  of  underinsured motorist\n\nbenefits  under the two policies -- up to $500,000 from the Aetna\n\npolicy and  up to $300,000 under  the Royal policy.   Because the\n\ntortfeasor effectively contributed $200,000, Aetna  and Royal are\n\nentitled  to reduce  the  total amount  of underinsured  benefits\n\navailable to Blevio, $800,000, to $600,000 of available benefits.\n\nThe  two insurers  must allocate  the $200,000  deduction between\n\nthem fairly,  sharing the  loss pro rata  to the extent  of their\n\ncoverage.6\n\n                    \n\n6     The   parties  do  not   challenge  the   district  court's\ndetermination  that both  Aetna  and Royal  should be  considered\n\"primary\" insurers in  the context  of this appeal,  and that  if\nthis Court upholds the  district court's determination that Aetna\nand Royal  are required to  allocate the deduction  between them,\nthey  should share  the  loss pro  rata  to the  extent  of their\ncoverage (i.e., Aetna  with $500,000 coverage  may take 5/8th  or\n\n                               -10-\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n                 \n\n                    \n\n$125,000 of the setoff, and Royal with $300,000 coverage may take\n3/8th or $75,000).\n\n                               -11-\n",

(\"Royal\"), to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties under two motor vehicle underinsurance policies.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The disposition of these motions turned on the issue of whether, under the law of Connecticut, two insurers, who each provide underinsured motorist coverage to a party injured in an accident, can each set off in full, from the limits of their coverage, the amount of the recovery obtained from the party legally responsible for the accident.  The district court found that each insurer was not entitled to set off the recovery from the tortfeasor in full, but rather that the two insurers could only deduct the amount of the recovery from the aggregated underinsured motorist coverage limits.  844 F.Supp. 849.   For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>A. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute the material facts of this case.  Noah Blevio died on August 9, 1991, from fatal injuries sustained when he was hit by a pickup truck on June 30, 1991.  The combined limits of the tortfeasors' applicable bodily injury liability policies totalled $200,000.  This amount was offered to Blevio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Noah Blevio had underinsured motorist coverage up to $500,000 under his father's Aetna business policy and up to $300,000 under his brother's Royal policy.  Both policies provided that their underinsured motorist coverage shall be reduced by the amounts paid by, or on behalf of, the legally responsible party.

Nor do the parties dispute that Aetna and Royal are entitled to a setoff by virtue of the existence of the legally responsible parties' liability payment.  Rather, the only issue is the extent to which liability insurance payments made on the tortfeasor's behalf can be set off.  Blevio contends that Aetna and Royal can only share one $200,000 setoff equal to the amount that Blevio will actually collect from the tortfeasors.  Both Aetna and Royal claim, however, that they are each entitled to deduct the tortfeasors' $200,000 liability payment in order to give full effect to their separate underinsurance setoff provisions, thereby reducing the aggregate underinsurance coverage available to Blevio from $800,000 to $400,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blevio filed a declaratory judgment action on June 11, 1993, asking that the district court determine the extent to which Aetna and Royal are entitled to set off the limits of the available bodily injury liability coverage from the underinsured motorist coverage of their respective policies.  Blevio then filed a \"Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or for Summary Judgment.\"   Aetna and Royal cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing, the district court entered judgment for Blevio.  The district court advised Aetna and Royal, however, that because, at the time, no Connecticut appellate court had directly addressed the issue, and a split of authority existed between two Connecticut Superior Court decisions that had addressed the issue, it would certify the issue presented to the Supreme Court of Connecticut upon their request.  Aetna and Royal then filed an \"Ex Parte Motion for Certification of Question of Law.\"   The district court vacated the judgment in favor of Blevio, and allowed certification to the Supreme Court of Connecticut.  The Supreme Court of Connecticut declined the certification request.  On February 24, 1994, the district court then entered final judgment in favor of Blevio and against Aetna and Royal.  Aetna and Royal now appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is plenary.  Alan Corp. v. International Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 22 F.3d 339, 341 (1st Cir.1994).  Where, as here, the parties do not dispute the facts upon which coverage is allowed or denied under an insurance policy, and the existence or amount of coverage depends solely upon a construction of the policy, a question of law is presented.  Id. at 342 (citing Atlas Pallet, Inc. v. Gallagher, 725 F.2d 131, 134 (1st Cir.1984)).  Therefore, like other questions of law, we are not bound by the district court's interpretation of the policy.  Alan Corp., 22 F.3d at 342.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute that Connecticut law applies.  In interpreting Connecticut law, we are bound by intermediate appellate state court decisions construing state law unless we are convinced that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.  Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S. 456, 465, 87 S.Ct. 1776, 1782, 18 L.Ed.2d 886 (1967);  Ground Air Transfer, Inc. v. Westates Airlines, Inc., 899 F.2d 1269, 1275 (1st Cir.1990);  see Cola v. Reardon, 787 F.2d 681, 688 n. 5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 930, 107 S.Ct. 398, 93 L.Ed.2d 351 (1986) (stating that the First Circuit was bound to apply a state appellate court's statement of local law).  We note that since the district court issued its decision in the present case, the Connecticut Court of Appeals has released a decision, Allstate Ins. Co. v. Link, 35 Conn.App. 338, 645 A.2d 1052 (1994), that resolves the question involved in this appeal.  Because we have no reason to believe that the Connecticut Supreme Court would not reach a similar result, we are bound to apply this decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connecticut law requires that each automobile liability insurance policy provide uninsured motorist coverage for the protection of persons insured thereunder against operators of uninsured and underinsured motor vehicles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Conn.Gen.St. Sec. 38a-336(a).  The statute requires that each policy provide a minimum level of uninsured/underinsured motorist protection, but also prevents an insured from obtaining a double recovery of damages.  See Buell v. American Universal Ins. Co., 224 Conn. 766, 621 A.2d 262, 266-67 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>An insurance company shall be obligated to make payment to its insured up to the limits of the policy's uninsured motorist coverage after the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements, but in no event shall the total amount of recovery from all policies, including any amount recovered under the insured's uninsured motorist coverage, exceed the limits of the insured's uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conn.Gen.St. Sec. 38a-336(b).  Correspondingly, the insurance commissioner has adopted a regulation that provides, in pertinent part, that an insurance policy \"may provide for the reduction of limits [of underinsured motorist liability] to the extent that damages have been ... paid by or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury....\"  Conn.Agencies Regs. Sec. 38a-334-6(d)(1).  The Aetna and Royal policies' underinsured motorist coverage provisions contain language that essentially track the Connecticut law, and provide that their policies' liability limits shall be reduced by any sum paid by, or for, anyone who is legally responsible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the Connecticut Court of Appeals has recently construed Conn.Agencies Regs. Sec. 38(a)-334-6(d)(1), and addressed the situation of setoffs in the context of multiple underinsured motorist coverage in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Link, 35 Conn.App. 338, 645 A.2d 1052 (1994).  The Court of Appeals held that multiple insurers providing underinsured motorist coverage to an insured cannot each setoff in full the amount of the recovery from the tortfeasor.  Id. 645 A.2d at 1058.   In Allstate Ins. Co., Link was injured when the automobile she was driving was struck by a vehicle operated by a tortfeasor.  Id. at 1054.   The tortfeasor's insurance company paid $100,000 to Link, exhausting the limits of the tortfeasor's bodily injury liability coverage.  Id.  At the time of the accident, Link held two separate automobile insurance policies with Allstate.  Id.  One policy provided for $200,000 of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and the other policy provided for $400,000 of such coverage.  Id.  Link claimed underinsured motorist benefits under both policies.  Id.  After arbitration, the Connecticut Superior Court found that the tortfeasor was underinsured, and that Link was entitled to underinsured motorist benefits from each of the two policies.  Id.  The court determined that the amount of available underinsured motorist coverage was $600,000, but that each policy should have deducted from its cumulative limit the sum of $100,000 previously paid by the tortfeasor.  Id. at 1054-55.   Link appealed, claiming that the court improperly reduced the amount of underinsured motorist benefits awarded to her by crediting Allstate with twice the amount actually paid out by the tortfeasor, thus creating a windfall to Allstate and depriving Link of a payment of $100,000 due her that she did not receive.  Id. at 1057.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Connecticut Court of Appeals agreed and found that Link was entitled to have available a total of $600,000 in underinsured motorist benefits under the two Allstate policies.  Id. at 1057-58.   While noting that no Connecticut Supreme Court case had specifically addressed this issue, the Court of Appeals stated that some related cases had implied that a tortfeasor's contribution should be shared among the policies covering the insured.  Id. at 1057.   The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>The amount of damages paid by the tortfeasor may reduce the total amount of underinsured motorist benefits available to a claimant.  It may not reduce the amounts paid out by each policy.  To hold otherwise would mean that an award due an insured is reduced unfairly by twice the amount actually paid out by or on behalf of the tortfeasor and that an insured is entitled to double the tortfeasor's credit merely by issuing separate policies.  Such a result would be unfairly detrimental to the insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1058.   The court then concluded that from the $600,000 total, Allstate should have been credited with only the $100,000 actually paid by the tortfeasor.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar result is mandated here.  Blevio was entitled to an aggregate of up to $800,000 of underinsured motorist benefits under the two policies--up to $500,000 from the Aetna policy and up to $300,000 under the Royal policy.  Because the tortfeasor effectively contributed $200,000, Aetna and Royal are entitled to reduce the total amount of underinsured benefits available to Blevio, $800,000, to $600,000 of available benefits.  The two insurers must allocate the $200,000 deduction between them fairly, sharing the loss pro rata to the extent of their coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Aetna policy defines an \"uninsured motor vehicle\" as a motor vehicle that is underinsured, in that \"the sum of all liability bonds or policies at the time of an 'accident' provides at least the amounts required by the applicable law where a covered 'auto' is principally garaged but that sum is less than the Limit of Insurance of this coverage.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Royal policy defines \"uninsured motor vehicle\" as a motor vehicle \"[f]or which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the sum of the limits of liability for Uninsured Motorists Coverage applicable to each vehicle insured for this coverage under this policy.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Pursuant to the terms of the insurance contracts, the issue of whether Blevio is legally entitled to recover, and if so, the amount of damages, are subject to arbitration.

(\"Royal\"), to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties under two motor vehicle underinsurance policies.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The disposition of these motions turned on the issue of whether, under the law of Connecticut, two insurers, who each provide underinsured motorist coverage to a party injured in an accident, can each set off in full, from the limits of their coverage, the amount of the recovery obtained from the party legally responsible for the accident.  The district court found that each insurer was not entitled to set off the recovery from the tortfeasor in full, but rather that the two insurers could only deduct the amount of the recovery from the aggregated underinsured motorist coverage limits.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute the material facts of this case.  Noah Blevio died on August 9, 1991, from fatal injuries sustained when he was hit by a pickup truck on June 30, 1991.  The combined limits of the tortfeasors' applicable bodily injury liability policies totalled $200,000.  This amount was offered to Blevio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Noah Blevio had underinsured motorist coverage up to $500,000 under his father's Aetna business policy and up to $300,000 under his brother's Royal policy.  Both policies provided that their underinsured motorist coverage shall be reduced by the amounts paid by, or on behalf of, the legally responsible party.

Nor do the parties dispute that Aetna and Royal are entitled to a setoff by virtue of the existence of the legally responsible parties' liability payment.  Rather, the only issue is the extent to which liability insurance payments made on the tortfeasor's behalf can be set off.  Blevio contends that Aetna and Royal can only share one $200,000 setoff equal to the amount that Blevio will actually collect from the tortfeasors.  Both Aetna and Royal claim, however, that they are each entitled to deduct the tortfeasors' $200,000 liability payment in order to give full effect to their separate underinsurance setoff provisions, thereby reducing the aggregate underinsurance coverage available to Blevio from $800,000 to $400,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blevio filed a declaratory judgment action on June 11, 1993, asking that the district court determine the extent to which Aetna and Royal are entitled to set off the limits of the available bodily injury liability coverage from the underinsured motorist coverage of their respective policies.  Blevio then filed a \"Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or for Summary Judgment.\"   Aetna and Royal cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing, the district court entered judgment for Blevio.  The district court advised Aetna and Royal, however, that because, at the time, no Connecticut appellate court had directly addressed the issue, and a split of authority existed between two Connecticut Superior Court decisions that had addressed the issue, it would certify the issue presented to the Supreme Court of Connecticut upon their request.  Aetna and Royal then filed an \"Ex Parte Motion for Certification of Question of Law.\"   The district court vacated the judgment in favor of Blevio, and allowed certification to the Supreme Court of Connecticut.  The Supreme Court of Connecticut declined the certification request.  On February 24, 1994, the district court then entered final judgment in favor of Blevio and against Aetna and Royal.  Aetna and Royal now appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connecticut law requires that each automobile liability insurance policy provide uninsured motorist coverage for the protection of persons insured thereunder against operators of uninsured and underinsured motor vehicles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Conn.Gen.St. Sec. 38a-336(a).  The statute requires that each policy provide a minimum level of uninsured/underinsured motorist protection, but also prevents an insured from obtaining a double recovery of damages.  See Buell v. American Universal Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span>, 266-67 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>An insurance company shall be obligated to make payment to its insured up to the limits of the policy's uninsured motorist coverage after the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements, but in no event shall the total amount of recovery from all policies, including any amount recovered under the insured's uninsured motorist coverage, exceed the limits of the insured's uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conn.Gen.St. Sec. 38a-336(b).  Correspondingly, the insurance commissioner has adopted a regulation that provides, in pertinent part, that an insurance policy \"may provide for the reduction of limits [of underinsured motorist liability] to the extent that damages have been ... paid by or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury....\"  Conn.Agencies Regs. Sec. 38a-334-6(d)(1).  The Aetna and Royal policies' underinsured motorist coverage provisions contain language that essentially track the Connecticut law, and provide that their policies' liability limits shall be reduced by any sum paid by, or for, anyone who is legally responsible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the Connecticut Court of Appeals has recently construed Conn.Agencies Regs. Sec. 38(a)-334-6(d)(1), and addressed the situation of setoffs in the context of multiple underinsured motorist coverage in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Link, 35 Conn.App. 338, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span> </span>(1994).  The Court of Appeals held that multiple insurers providing underinsured motorist coverage to an insured cannot each setoff in full the amount of the recovery from the tortfeasor.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> 645 A.2d </span>at 1058.   In Allstate Ins. Co., Link was injured when the automobile she was driving was struck by a vehicle operated by a tortfeasor.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1054. </span>  The tortfeasor's insurance company paid $100,000 to Link, exhausting the limits of the tortfeasor's bodily injury liability coverage.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  At the </span>time of the accident, Link held two separate automobile insurance policies with Allstate.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  One policy </span>provided for $200,000 of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and the other policy provided for $400,000 of such coverage.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Link claimed </span>underinsured motorist benefits under both policies.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  After arbitration, </span>the Connecticut Superior Court found that the tortfeasor was underinsured, and that Link was entitled to underinsured motorist benefits from each of the two policies.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The court </span>determined that the amount of available underinsured motorist coverage was $600,000, but that each policy should have deducted from its cumulative limit the sum of $100,000 previously paid by the tortfeasor.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1054-55. </span>  Link appealed, claiming that the court improperly reduced the amount of underinsured motorist benefits awarded to her by crediting Allstate with twice the amount actually paid out by the tortfeasor, thus creating a windfall to Allstate and depriving Link of a payment of $100,000 due her that she did not receive.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1057.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Connecticut Court of Appeals agreed and found that Link was entitled to have available a total of $600,000 in underinsured motorist benefits under the two Allstate policies.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1057-58. </span>  While noting that no Connecticut Supreme Court case had specifically addressed this issue, the Court of Appeals stated that some related cases had implied that a tortfeasor's contribution should be shared among the policies covering the insured.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1057. </span>  The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>The amount of damages paid by the tortfeasor may reduce the total amount of underinsured motorist benefits available to a claimant.  It may not reduce the amounts paid out by each policy.  To hold otherwise would mean that an award due an insured is reduced unfairly by twice the amount actually paid out by or on behalf of the tortfeasor and that an insured is entitled to double the tortfeasor's credit merely by issuing separate policies.  Such a result would be unfairly detrimental to the insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1058. </span>  The court then concluded that from the $600,000 total, Allstate should have been credited with only the $100,000 actually paid by the tortfeasor.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar result is mandated here.  Blevio was entitled to an aggregate of up to $800,000 of underinsured motorist benefits under the two policies--up to $500,000 from the Aetna policy and up to $300,000 under the Royal policy.  Because the tortfeasor effectively contributed $200,000, Aetna and Royal are entitled to reduce the total amount of underinsured benefits available to Blevio, $800,000, to $600,000 of available benefits.  The two insurers must allocate the $200,000 deduction between them fairly, sharing the loss pro rata to the extent of their coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Aetna policy defines an \"uninsured motor vehicle\" as a motor vehicle that is underinsured, in that \"the sum of all liability bonds or policies at the time of an 'accident' provides at least the amounts required by the applicable law where a covered 'auto' is principally garaged but that sum is less than the Limit of Insurance of this coverage.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Royal policy defines \"uninsured motor vehicle\" as a motor vehicle \"[f]or which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the sum of the limits of liability for Uninsured Motorists Coverage applicable to each vehicle insured for this coverage under this policy.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Pursuant to the terms of the insurance contracts, the issue of whether Blevio is legally entitled to recover, and if so, the amount of damages, are subject to arbitration.
