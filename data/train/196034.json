Plaintiff David  Gordon Fleming,  a Maine\r                            \n\ninmate,  appeals pro  se from  a judgment  against him  in an\r                                    \n\naction  brought  pursuant  to 42  U.S.C.     1983.   For  the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n     On April 28, 1994, Fleming filed a complaint in district\n\ncourt against fifteen named prison officials alleging various\n\nviolations  of his constitutional  rights.  That  same day, a\n\nmagistrate  judge (\"magistrate\")  granted his  application to\n\nproceed  in  forma pauperis  (\"IFP\").   On  May 2,  1994, the\r                                       \n\nmagistrate recommended  that the  complaint  be dismissed  as\n\nfrivolous  under 28 U.S.C.   1915(d).   On June 15, 1994, the\n\ndistrict judge  reviewed the matter de novo  and ordered that\r                                                       \n\nthe complaint  be dismissed  with the exception  of Fleming's\n\nclaim that he was not provided with a copy of the Maine State\n\nPrison's  rules  and  regulations  prior  to  a  disciplinary\n\nproceeding brought against him.\n\n     On August  12, 1994,  Fleming made  service  by mail  on\n\ndefendants   Commissioner   Donald   Allen,   Warden   Martin\n\nMagnusson, and  Deputy Warden  Nelson Riley.   On August  30,\n\n1994, the district  court sua sponte ordered  Fleming to show\r                                                \n\ncause why he  had not  made timely service  on the  remaining\n\ntwelve defendants.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).   After Fleming\r                                   \n\nresponded that it was his belief that the unserved defendants\n\nwere  not  implicated  in   the  sole  surviving  claim,  the\r\r\n\ncomplaint  was  dismissed  without  prejudice   as  to  these\n\ndefendants.\n\n     On August 31, 1994, the  three served defendants filed a\n\nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.   Fleming did\n\nnot file an objection to this motion.  On September 14, 1994,\n\nhowever,  Fleming  filed  a   motion  seeking  leave  to  add\n\nadditional defendants to  the complaint.  On October 6, 1994,\n\nthe  magistrate recommended  that  the motion  to dismiss  be\n\nallowed  pursuant to  Local Rule  19(c) of the  United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of  Maine which provides that\n\n\"[u]nless with ten (10) days after the filing of a motion the\n\nopposing  party files written objection  thereto . .  . , the\n\nopposing  party shall  be deemed  to have  waived objection.\"\n\nThe magistrate  further recommended  that the  motion seeking\n\nleave to add  additional defendants  be denied as  moot.   On\n\nOctober  24, 1994, the district  judge reviewed the matter de\r                                                                         \n\nnovo and adopted the magistrate's recommendations.   Judgment\r                \n\nentered, and this appeal followed.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n     Fleming argues  that the complaint should  not have been\n\ndismissed with respect to the unserved defendants for failure\n\nto effect timely service.  He does not deny that he failed to\n\nserve these defendants within the  120 day period provided by\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).  However,  he contends that as a pro se\r                                                                         \n\ndefendant, he  should  not  have been  held  to  the  \"strict\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nletter\"  of the rule.  He  also suggests that, pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C.    1915(c), it  was not his  responsibility to  effect\n\nservice.       Flemings' pro se status does not insulate  him\r                                           \n\nfrom compliance  with the  Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure.\n\nFDIC  v. Anchor Properties, 13  F.3d 27, 31  (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                      \n\nSection 1915(c) does provide that where, as here, a plaintiff\n\nis proceeding IFP, \"the officers of the court shall issue and\n\nserve all process.\"  However,  an IFP plaintiff must  request\n\nthat the court officer serve his complaint before the officer\n\nwill be responsible for such service.   Boudette v. Barnette,\r                                                                        \n\n923 F.2d  754, 757 (9th Cir.  1991).  Fleming did  not allege\n\nbelow  that he  made  such a  request.   On the  contrary, he\n\nindicated  that  he had  chosen  not to  proceed  against the\n\nunserved defendants.   Under the circumstances,  there was no\n\nabuse  of discretion in dismissing his  complaint as to these\n\ndefendants.  \n\n     Fleming  also argues  that the  district court  erred in\n\ngranting the motion to dismiss the complaint as to the served\n\ndefendants based upon his  failure to comply with  Local Rule\n\n19(c).   We disagree.  A  pro se litigant must  comply with a\r                                            \n\ndistrict  court's procedural  rules, as  well as  the Federal\n\nRules  of Civil Procedure.  See Anchor Properties, 13 F.3d at\r                                                             \n\n31;  see also Corey v. Mast  Rd. Grain &amp; Bldg. Materials Co.,\r                                                                        \n\n738  F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1984) (holding that district court\n\nwas entitled to  insist upon compliance  with its local  rule\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nwhich  required  plaintiff  to  respond within  ten  days  to\n\ndefendants' motion  for  dismissal).   Contrary to  Flemings'\n\nsuggestion,  we do not think his September 14, 1994 motion to\n\nadd defendants should have been construed as an objection  to\n\nthe motion to  dismiss.  We add that, in any event, Flemings'\n\ncomplaint that he was not provided with  a copy of the prison\n\nrules failed to allege sufficient involvement or knowledge on\n\nthe part of  the served  defendants to state  a   1983  claim\n\nagainst them.  See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d\r                                                               \n\n553, 562 (1st Cir.  1989) (liability under   1983  may not be\n\npredicated upon a theory of respondeat superior).  \n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

Fleming did not allege below that he made such a request.  On the contrary, he indicated that he had chosen not to proceed against the unserved defendants.  Under the circumstances, there was no abuse of discretion in dismissing his complaint as to these defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fleming also argues that the district court erred in granting the motion to dismiss the complaint as to the served defendants based upon his failure to comply with Local Rule 19(c).  We disagree.  A pro se litigant must comply with a district court's procedural rules, as well as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Contrary to Flemings' suggestion, we do not think his September 14, 1994 motion to add defendants should have been construed as an objection to the motion to dismiss.  We add that, in any event, Flemings' complaint that he was not provided with a copy of the prison rules failed to allege sufficient involvement or knowledge on the part of the served defendants to state a Sec. 1983 claim against them.
