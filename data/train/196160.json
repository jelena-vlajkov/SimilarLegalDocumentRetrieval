In proving its  case, the government relied\r\n\nin part on  incriminating statements  that Shay Jr.  made to  the\r\n\npolice, the media, and fellow  inmates.  The defendant  responded\r\n\nby arguing  that his  statements were  unreliable  and should  be\r\n\ndisregarded.  In  this opinion,  we determine  whether the  court\r\n\nproperly prevented the defendant  from supporting his argument by\r\n\ncalling  a psychiatrist to testify that he suffered from a mental\r\n\ndisorder that  causes its  victims  to make  false and  grandiose\r\n\nstatements without regard  to the consequences.

The Explosion\r                           \r\n\n          Two  officers from  the Boston  Police Department  Bomb\r\n\nSquad were  sent to the  home of  Shay Jr.'s father,  Thomas Shay\r\n\nSr., after Shay Sr. informed the police that he  had discovered a\r\n\nsuspicious black  box in his  driveway that had  become dislodged\r\n\nfrom  the  undercarriage of  his car.    While the  officers were\r\n\nexamining the  box, it exploded, killing  Officer Jeremiah Hurley\r\n\nand seriously  wounding Officer Frances  Foley.  Agents  from the\r\n\nBureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms, working with the Boston\r\n\nPolice Department, later determined that the box contained two to\r\n\nthree sticks  of repackaged dynamite, a remote control device and\r\n\nother components necessary  to detonate  the bomb  from a  remote\r\n\nlocation.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nB.  The Government's Case\r          B.  The Government's Case\r                                   \r\n\n          The  government's  trial  theory   was  that  Shay  Jr.\r\n\nconspired  with a  friend,  Alfred Trenkler,  to kill  Shay Jr.'s\r\n\nfather by  blowing  up  his  car.    In  proving  its  case,  the\r\n\ngovernment  relied primarily on  several incriminating statements\r\n\nthat  Shay Jr.  made  after the  bombing.   We describe  his most\r\n\ndamaging  statements   to  illustrate  their  importance  to  the\r\n\ngovernment's case.\r\n\n          1.  Shortly after  the bombing, Shay Jr. told  a police\r\n\nofficer, \"he was sorry about it and wished he could turn back the\r\n\nhands of time  and make it  not have  happened.\"  The  government\r\n\nargued  at trial that this  statement was evidence  of Shay Jr.'s\r\n\nguilty conscience.\r\n\n          2.  Shay Jr. told  reporters covering the bombing  that\r\n\nhe  had been questioned about  whether his father  was capable of\r\n\nconstructing a remote control device.  Because the police claimed\r\n\nthat  they  did not  question Shay  Jr.  about the  bomb's remote\r\n\ncontrol detonator until  after Shay Jr. made  this statement, the\r\n\ngovernment argued  that the statement demonstrated  that Shay Jr.\r\n\nhad special knowledge  about the bomb that  only a co-conspirator\r\n\nwould possess.\r\n\n          3.  Shay Jr. gave an interview to a television reporter\r\n\nin  which  he made  several  statements  concerning the  bombing.\r\n\nAlthough  he claimed in the interview that  he was only guilty of\r\n\nknowing who had built  the bomb after-the-fact, he  admitted that\r\n\nTrenkler had told him  before the bombing that he  was planning a\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n\"surprise\"  for Shay Jr., which turned out  to be the bomb.  Shay\r\n\nJr. also acknowledged during the  interview that he had purchased\r\n\na toggle switch and an \"AA\" battery holder that Trenkler had used\r\n\nin building the bomb.\r\n\n          4.   Shay Jr.  allegedly told  a fellow  cellmate, \"I'm\r\n\nboom, boom.  Don't  you know me?  You  have to know me.   I'm the\r\n\none who  killed the Boston cop.\"  According to the cellmate, Shay\r\n\nJr.  also told  him  that  he and  Trenkler  had  built the  bomb\r\n\ntogether and  attached it  to the  undercarriage of  his father's\r\n\ncar. \r\n\n          The  government  supported  Shay   Jr.'s  incriminating\r\n\nstatements  about  the  bombing  with other  evidence  that:  (a)\r\n\nTrenkler and Shay Jr.  were friends who were in  sporadic contact\r\n\nfrom 1988 through the fall of 1991; (b) Trenkler had the skill to\r\n\nconstruct  the bomb; (c) gray  duct tape consistent  with that in\r\n\nthe  bomb  was  discovered in  a  search  of Trenkler's  parents'\r\n\nresidence; (d) ten days prior to the explosion, someone purchased\r\n\na toggle switch and \"AA\" battery  holder of the same type used in\r\n\nthe bomb from  a Radio  Shack store located  directly across  the\r\n\nstreet from where Trenkler was working; (e) Radio Shack's records\r\n\nlisted  the purchaser's  name as  \"SAHY,\" and  his identification\r\n\nnumber corresponding  to the  last four  digits of his  telephone\r\n\nnumber as \"3780,\" which  was similar to  the last four digits  of\r\n\nShay  Sr.'s  home  telephone number,  \"7380\";  (f)  Shay  Jr. was\r\n\nstrongly  motivated  to  kill  his  father  because  they  had  a\r\n\ndifficult \"love-hate\" relationship, and Shay Jr. believed that he\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nwould  collect  a  substantial  inheritance if  his  father  were\r\n\nkilled; and (g)  Shay Jr. demonstrated consciousness  of guilt by\r\n\nfleeing the jurisdiction after he was released on  bail following\r\n\nhis arrest on an unrelated matter.\r\n\nC.  The Defendant's Case\r          C.  The Defendant's Case\r                                  \r\n\n          Shay Jr. responded to  the government's case by arguing\r\n\nthat his statements about  the bombing were unreliable,  that the\r\n\nrest  of the  evidence failed  to establish  his guilt,  and that\r\n\nother evidence suggested that  Shay Sr. may have built  the bomb.\r\n\nHis attack on the statements comprised three parts.  First, in an\r\n\neffort to demonstrate  that he  made the statements  in order  to\r\n\nfulfill a  compulsive need for  attention even  though they  were\r\n\nfalse, the defense elicited testimony from several witnesses that\r\n\nShay  Jr.  regularly  told  the  same  grandiose  stories,  often\r\n\nchanging significant  details each time he  told them; repeatedly\r\n\nsought out the media to talk about the bombing even though it was\r\n\nnot in his interest to do so; made comments concerning the police\r\n\ninvestigation  which  were  not  confirmed  by  the  police;  and\r\n\nexpressed abnormal interest in the media attention he received as\r\n\na result of his statements.\r\n\n          Second, the  defense attempted to show  that Shay Jr.'s\r\n\nmany   statements  about   the  bombing   were  conflicting   and\r\n\ndemonstrably wrong  about important details that  would have been\r\n\nknown  by a co-conspirator.   In other words,  as defense counsel\r\n\nstated in her summation, \"[Shay Jr.] may be  trying to talk about\r\n\nthis crime, but  he doesn't make it.   He can't pull it off.   He\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ndoesn't have the  facts right.\"   To illustrate  this point,  the\r\n\ndefense pointed  to Shay Jr.'s repeated  and incorrect statements\r\n\nthat  the  bomb  contained   C-4  explosive  (or  plastique)  and\r\n\nbatteries purchased from Radio Shack.\r\n\n          Finally,  the  defense  attempted  to  call  Dr. Robert\r\n\nPhillips, a psychiatrist, who  was prepared to testify that  Shay\r\n\nJr.  suffered   from  a  recognized  mental   disorder  known  as\r\n\n\"pseudologia  fantastica.\"1    According to  Dr.  Phillips,  this\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Pseudologia fantastica is categorized as a factitious disorder\r\nin the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (3d\r\ned.  1987)   [\"DSMIII-R\"]  and   is  sometimes  referred   to  as\r\nMunchausen's Disease named  after Baron von Munchausen  who was a\r\nGerman  storyteller who  wandered the  countryside spinning  tall\r\ntales.\r\n\n   Pseudologia  fantastica   is  a   variant   of  lying,   often\r\ncharacterized  as an  extreme  form of  pathological  lying.   R.\r\nSharrock and  M. Cresswell, Pseudologia Fantastica:  A Case Study\r                                                                           \r\nof a Man Charged with Murder, 29 Med. Sci.

Dithrich,  Pseudologia Fantastica,  Dissociation, and\r                                                                           \r\nPotential  Space, in Child  Treatment, 72  Int. J.  Psycho.

The gain for the pseudologue could be ego\r                        \r\nenhancement or the attention  received as a result of  the story.\r\nSharrock and Cresswell, supra at 323.   Many lie for no  apparent\r                                       \r\nreason, in circumstances where they have nothing to gain from not\r\ntelling the truth.  Anne Vaughan, \"Believe me - I cannot tell the\r\ntruth,\" The Independent, July 9, 1991, at 13.\r\n\n   Pseudologues are also  often highly compliant  and suggestible\r\nto misleading information.  Sharrock and Cresswell, supra at 323.\r                                                                   \r\n\"'They are  often histrionic or  suggestible types who  thrive on\r\nattention  and lie for a  quick high...and don't  worry about the\r\nconsequences.'\"  Vaughan, supra.  Furthermore, even when they are\r                                         \r\nconfronted  with  their lies,  many  pseudologues  are unable  to\r\ncontrol their lies.

Usually these\r\nhave  been  high-profile,  well-publicized  cases  such  as  bank\r\nrobberies.   'This group of pseudologues loves the excitement and\r\npower  that  helping  the police  brings.

Evid. 702  to exclude  expert  testimony that  will not\r\n\n\"assist  the trier  of  fact to  understand  the evidence  or  to\r\n\ndetermine a fact in  issue.\"  Shay Jr. contends that the decision\r\n\nwas based upon  an erroneous  interpretation of Rule  702.3   The\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            fantastic ones about  tanks and  bombers,\r\n            and other things.\r\n\n               Under  these  circumstances, the  jury\r\n            does  not  need  expert evidence  on  the\r\n            issue  of  the  defendant's  credibility.\r\n            And   there  is,  with  respect  to  this\r\n            evidence, the additional danger  that the\r\n            expert   will   go   beyond   the   brief\r\n            references  to -- I  think it's called --\r\n            pseudologiafantastica [sic]  in the areas\r\n            that are  in  fact inadmissible  such  as\r\n            diminished     capacity,     personality,\r\n            deficit, and so on.\r\n\n               The quintessential question is whether\r\n            the jury will  believe what the defendant\r\n            says,  and on  that question,  given this\r\n            record,   the  jury  does  not  need  any\r\n            additional expert evidence or  any expert\r\n            evidence.   Accordingly, I  will rule out\r\n            the  defendant's  proffer on  that issue,\r\n            and  your objection  is noted  as  is the\r\n            Government's.\r\n\n3   Shay Jr. also  argues that  the exclusion  of Dr.  Phillips's\r\ntestimony  violated  his  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  present  a\r\ncomplete  defense.   The  Sixth   Amendment's Compulsory  Process\r\nClause  has been interpreted to entitle a defendant to both \"'the\r\nright to the government's assistance in compelling the attendance\r\nof  favorable witnesses at  trial and the  right to  put before a\r\njury evidence that might  influence the determination of guilt.'\"\r\nTaylor   v.

Nevertheless,\r                                  \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ngovernment  argues  that the  district  court did  not  abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion in  excluding the  evidence and  alternatively asserts\r\n\nthat the court was obligated to exclude the  evidence as a matter\r\n\nof law because it  concerned a credibility question that  was the\r\n\njury's exclusive  province  to resolve.   We  first consider  the\r\n\ngovernment's argument for categorical exclusion.\r\n\n          1.   Must expert testimony concerning credibility\r                    1.

We need  not define the\r                             \r\nouter limits of  Shay Jr.'s  Sixth Amendment rights  in order  to\r\ndecide the present case  because, at least in this  instance, the\r\nSixth Amendment offers  Shay Jr. no  greater protection than  the\r\nrules of evidence.

See, e.g., Bachman,\r                                                                          \r\n\n953 F.2d  at 441; Benson, 941  F.2d at 604-05; cf.  Fed. R.

In\r\n\nthe present case, the district court precluded  Dr. Phillips from\r\n\ntestifying rather  than merely limiting his  testimony to matters\r\n\nthat were within the scope of his expertise.  Thus, the decisions\r\n\nthe government cites do not justify the court's ruling.\r\n\n          The government's position is further undermined  by the\r\n\nrules  themselves which  recognize that  expert testimony  may be\r\n\nadmitted to  establish a  witness's  character for  truthfulness.\r\n\nFed.  R.  Evid.  402  provides  that  all  relevant  evidence  is\r\n\nadmissible unless its exclusion  is required by the Constitution,\r\n\nan  act  of  Congress,  or another  rule,  and  no constitutional\r\n\nprovision,  law,  or rule  requires  the  automatic exclusion  of\r\n\nexpert  testimony  simply  because  it  concerns   a  credibility\r\n\nquestion.    See Margaret  Berger, United  States  v.

The advisory committee's note to\r\n\nRule 608(a) references Fed. R. Evid.  405(a), which describes the\r\n\nacceptable methods  for proving relevant character  traits.  Fed.\r\n\nR.

Judge  Becker,  who coined  the  term,\r\nillustrates  the  concept  with  the  following  example.   If  a\r\nplaintiff contends that  he or she  developed cancer after  being\r\nexposed to chemical X  and seeks to support that  contention with\r\nexpert testimony  that chemical X  causes cancer in  animals, the\r\ntestimony will  not  fit the  facts  of the  case and  should  be\r\nexcluded  unless  the  plaintiff   also  offers  reliable  expert\r\ntestimony  that  results  observed  in  the  animal  studies  are\r\ntransferable to  humans.

The district court\r\n\nexcluded the  testimony because  it concluded that  the testimony\r\n\nwould  not assist  the jury  in light  of  other evidence  in the\r\n\nrecord  concerning  the  reliability of  Shay  Jr.'s  statements.\r\n\nHowever,  whether or not the  jury had the  capacity to generally\r                                                                           \r\n\nassess  the reliability of these statements in light of the other\r\n\nevidence in  the case,  it plainly  was unqualified  to determine\r\n\nwithout  assistance the particular issue of  whether Shay Jr. may\r                                            \r\n\nhave  made false statements against  his own interests because he\r\n\nsuffered from  a mental disorder.   Common understanding conforms\r\n\nto the notion that  a person ordinarily does not  make untruthful\r\n\ninculpatory  statements.   See Fed.  R. Evid.  804(b)(3) advisory\r                                        \r\n\ncommittee's  note  (statements  against  interest  are especially\r\n\nreliable  because  \"persons  do  not make  statements  which  are\r\n\ndamaging  to themselves  unless satisfied  for good  reasons that\r\n\nthey  are  true\").    Dr. Phillips  would  have  testified  that,\r\n\ncontrary to this common sense assumption, Shay Jr.  suffered from\r\n\na recognized  mental  disorder  that caused  him  to  make  false\r\n\nstatements even  though they were inconsistent  with his apparent\r\n\nself-interest.    Thus,  Dr.   Phillips  was  prepared  to  offer\r\n\nspecialized  opinion testimony,  grounded in  his expertise  as a\r\n\npsychiatrist,  that could  have  \"explode[d] common  myths\" about\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nevidence vital to the government's case.  United States v. Moore,\r                                                                          \r\n\n786 F.2d 1308, 1312  (5th Cir. 1986) (citations omitted).   While\r\n\nthe  record contains other evidence  that Shay Jr.  told lies and\r\n\nboasted  to an unusual degree,  this evidence, standing alone, is\r\n\nmuch  less  powerful  than  the psychiatric  testimony  that  Dr.\r\n\nPhillips  was prepared  to offer.   Moreover,  the court  did not\r\n\nexpress any concern that Dr. Phillips was unqualified or that his\r\n\ntestimony  was unreliable because  it concerned some  novel or ad\r\n\nhoc syndrome.   Under all of  the circumstances, it  was a  clear\r\n\nerror in judgment for the district court to exclude the testimony\r\n\nunder any plausible interpretation of Rule 702.6\r\n\n          3.  Is a new trial required?\r                    3.  Is a new trial required?\r\n\n          Although a  court  may  not  exclude  expert  testimony\r\n\nsimply because it concerns a credibility question or because non-\r\n\nexpert testimony  was presented  on the  same  issue, it  retains\r\n\nample discretion to  exclude or  limit such  testimony for  other\r\n\nreasons.  Even if expert testimony is admissible pursuant to Rule\r\n\n702, it  may be disallowed pursuant  to Fed. R. Evid.  403 if its\r\n\nprejudicial,  misleading,  wasteful,  confusing,   or  cumulative\r\n\nnature  substantially  outweighs its  probative  value.   As  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6   The district court  also expressed concern  that Dr. Phillips\r\nshould not testify  because he might stray into the impermissible\r\nsubject of Shay Jr.'s mental capacity to commit the  crime.  This\r\nconcern, essentially that the  testimony might have a prejudicial\r\neffect, must  be addressed pursuant to Rule  403's balancing test\r\nrather  than pursuant  to Rule  702's helpfulness standard.   See\r                                                                           \r\nDaubert, 113 S. Ct. at 2798.  Applying Rule 403, we conclude that\r                 \r\nthe  potential for prejudice cited  by the court  could have been\r\nprevented  by  appropriate  limitations   on  the  scope  of  Dr.\r\nPhillips's  testimony.  Thus, the court's concern cannot serve as\r\nan independent basis for its decision.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nSupreme Court recently observed,  \"'[e]xpert evidence can be both\r\n\npowerful  and  quite  misleading  because of  the  difficulty  in\r\n\nevaluating  it.

We are unable  to\r\n\naddress these  arguments  on the  present record.   The  district\r\n\ncourt  did not hold an  evidentiary hearing on  these issues, nor\r\n\ndid  the court make any findings that would support the exclusion\r\n\nof  the  evidence  for  the  reasons  cited  by  the  government.\r\n\nAccordingly, the government's arguments must be addressed, in the\r\n\nfirst instance, by  the district court on remand.

Here,  the statements at issue were vital  to the\r\n\ngovernment's case.7   Moreover,  although the court  allowed Shay\r\n\nJr. to  indirectly attack the statements  through other evidence,\r\n\nhe  was deprived of the  opportunity to show  that his statements\r\n\nwere  the unreliable  product  of a  recognized mental  disorder.\r\n\nGiven the  importance of the statements to  the government's case\r\n\nand  the  severe restriction  placed  on  Shay Jr.'s  ability  to\r\n\nchallenge   them,   we  cannot   say   that   the  exclusion   of\r\n\nDr. Phillips's  testimony did  not  substantially  influence  the\r\n\njury's verdict.

He was also permitted  to\r\n\ntestify that he and Shay  Jr. had several discussions  concerning\r\n\nthe  receipt.  However, Shay  Jr. claims that  the district court\r\n\nimproperly prevented  McPhee from  also testifying that  Shay Jr.\r\n\ntold him  that he had never  seen the Radio  Shack receipt before\r\n\nMay 1992.   We conclude that Shay Jr. has  forfeited his right to\r\n\nraise  this  contention on  appeal  because the  record  does not\r\n\ndemonstrate  that  he  adequately   informed  the  court  of  the\r\n\nsubstance of the excluded evidence.

Of  particular  concern  to defense\r\n\ncounsel was the  extent to  which the court  would deem  McPhee's\r\n\ntestimony  to result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege\r\n\nand open the door to cross-examination as to the substance of the\r\n\ncommunications.  In  arguing that the  testimony would not  waive\r\n\nthe privilege, defense counsel repeatedly informed the court that\r\n\nshe did not  propose to ask  McPhee to describe the  substance of\r\n\nhis  conversations with  Shay  Jr.   Further,  in her  voir  dire\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nexamination,  defense  counsel, true  to  her  word, limited  her\r\n\ninquiry by not questioning McPhee concerning the substance of the\r\n\ncommunications.\r\n\n          McPhee's  testimony before the  jury followed  the path\r\n\ntraveled on voir dire.  After handing McPhee the redacted copy of\r\n\nthe  Radio  Shack  receipt,  defense  counsel  asked  McPhee  the\r\n\nfollowing questions:\r\n\n          COUNSEL:  And did  you have  one conversation\r\n          with Mr.  Shay on  [the subject of  the Radio\r\n          Shack Receipt] or more than one conversation?\r\n          WITNESS: I had more than one conversation.\r\n          COUNSEL: Can you tell us 1,2,3,4?\r\n          WITNESS: As many as I could focus Tom in on -\r\n          -\r\n          GOVT: Your honor, I object.\r\n          COURT: You can or can't recall, tell us.\r\n          WITNESS: I  can't recall the exact  number of\r\n          conversations on the  subject I had  with Mr.\r\n          Shay.\r\n          COUNSEL: But the subject of  the conversation\r\n          was --\r\n          GOVT:  Objection   to  the  subject   of  the\r\n          conversation.\r\n          COURT:  I  think  he  already  answered  your\r\n          question,  Ms.  Gertner.  You  may  be  going\r\n          further than you really want to.\r\n          COUNSEL: I want to make sure that the subject\r\n          of the  repeated conversations was  the Radio\r\n          Shack --\r\n          GOVT: Your  honor, I object  to the substance\r\n          of the conversation.\r\n          COURT: But you've already done it.\r\n          COUNSEL: I want to clarify that it was on the\r\n          subject of this document.\r\n          GOVT: Objection.\r\n          COURT: The objection is sustained.\r\n\nAt no point did defense counsel inform the court that she planned\r\n\nto have  McPhee testify that  Shay Jr. had  told him that  he had\r\n\nnever  seen  the Radio  Shack  receipt before  receiving  it from\r\n\nMcPhee.  To the  contrary, counsel's representations, both before\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nand during the  testimony, led the  district court to  reasonably\r\n\nconclude that the additional  testimony defense counsel sought to\r\n\nelicit  would   only  concern  matters  that   had  already  been\r\n\nadequately covered.  Accordingly, Shay Jr. forfeited his right to\r\n\nchallenge  the excluded evidence  on appeal by  failing to inform\r\n\nthe court  in a timely  manner of the  substance of  the excluded\r\n\nevidence.

In  later seeking  to obtain  a favorable\r\n\nruling  on a  motion in  limine, however,  Shay Jr.  informed the\r\n\ncourt that  his \"lack of  intent or knowledge  [would not  be] an\r\n\nissue.\"   Moreover,  after  the court  denied  his motion  for  a\r\n\nbifurcated  trial  on  the  issue of  insanity,  defense  counsel\r\n\ninformed the  court that \"we  will withdraw  any questions  about\r\n\ninsanity  because I believe quite clearly that it is not possible\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nto  defend  on  the  merits  and  insanity  at  the  same  time.\"\r\n\nNotwithstanding  these  representations,  Shay  Jr.  informed the\r\n\ncourt  on the  16th day  of  trial that  he might  seek to  offer\r\n\nevidence  on the subject of  diminished capacity.  In prohibiting\r\n\nhim from  raising the issue,  the court  found that Shay  Jr. had\r\n\nwithdrawn his  Rule 12.2 notice  and that it would  be \"unfair to\r\n\nthe  government  at  this late  date  to  suddenly change  horses\r\n\nagain.\"  Shay Jr. challenges the court's finding that he withdrew\r\n\nhis  Rule 12.2 notice and therefore contends that the court erred\r\n\nin  preventing him from offering expert testimony on the issue of\r\n\ndiminished capacity.9\r\n\n          We  review for  abuse of  discretion the  trial court's\r\n\ndetermination that Shay Jr.  withdrew his Rule 12.2 notice.

Moreover,  defense counsel\r\nmade no other offer of proof concerning the evidence she proposed\r\nto offer on  the subject.

In proving its case, the government relied in part on incriminating statements that Shay Jr. made to the police, the media, and fellow inmates.  The defendant responded by arguing that his statements were unreliable and should be disregarded.  In this opinion, we determine whether the court properly prevented the defendant from supporting his argument by calling a psychiatrist to testify that he suffered from a mental disorder that causes its victims to make false and grandiose statements without regard to the consequences.  We also address various other issues that the defendant raises on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>A. The Explosion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two officers from the Boston Police Department Bomb Squad were sent to the home of Shay Jr.'s father, Thomas Shay Sr., after Shay Sr. informed the police that he had discovered a suspicious black box in his driveway that had become dislodged from the undercarriage of his car.  While the officers were examining the box, it exploded, killing Officer Jeremiah Hurley and seriously wounding Officer Frances Foley.  Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, working with the Boston Police Department, later determined that the box contained two to three sticks of repackaged dynamite, a remote control device and other components necessary to detonate the bomb from a remote location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Government's Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's trial theory was that Shay Jr. conspired with a friend, Alfred Trenkler, to kill Shay Jr.'s father by blowing up his car.  In proving its case, the government relied primarily on several incriminating statements that Shay Jr. made after the bombing.  We describe his most damaging statements to illustrate their importance to the government's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Shortly after the bombing, Shay Jr. told a police officer, \"he was sorry about it and wished he could turn back the hands of time and make it not have happened.\"   The government argued at trial that this statement was evidence of Shay Jr.'s guilty conscience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Shay Jr. told reporters covering the bombing that he had been questioned about whether his father was capable of constructing a remote control device.  Because the police claimed that they did not question Shay Jr. about the bomb's remote control detonator until after Shay Jr. made this statement, the government argued that the statement demonstrated that Shay Jr. had special knowledge about the bomb that only a co-conspirator would possess.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Shay Jr. gave an interview to a television reporter in which he made several statements concerning the bombing.  Although he claimed in the interview that he was only guilty of knowing who had built the bomb after-the-fact, he admitted that Trenkler had told him before the bombing that he was planning a \"surprise\" for Shay Jr., which turned out to be the bomb.  Shay Jr. also acknowledged during the interview that he had purchased a toggle switch and an \"AA\" battery holder that Trenkler had used in building the bomb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Shay Jr. allegedly told a fellow cellmate, \"I'm boom, boom.  Don't you know me?   You have to know me.  I'm the one who killed the Boston cop.\"   According to the cellmate, Shay Jr. also told him that he and Trenkler had built the bomb together and attached it to the undercarriage of his father's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government supported Shay Jr.'s incriminating statements about the bombing with other evidence that:  (a) Trenkler and Shay Jr. were friends who were in sporadic contact from 1988 through the fall of 1991;  (b) Trenkler had the skill to construct the bomb;  (c) gray duct tape consistent with that in the bomb was discovered in a search of Trenkler's parents' residence;  (d) ten days prior to the explosion, someone purchased a toggle switch and \"AA\" battery holder of the same type used in the bomb from a Radio Shack store located directly across the street from where Trenkler was working;  (e) Radio Shack's records listed the purchaser's name as \"SAHY,\" and his identification number corresponding to the last four digits of his telephone number as \"3780,\" which was similar to the last four digits of Shay Sr.'s home telephone number, \"7380\";  (f) Shay Jr. was strongly motivated to kill his father because they had a difficult \"love-hate\" relationship, and Shay Jr. believed that he would collect a substantial inheritance if his father were killed;  and (g) Shay Jr. demonstrated consciousness of guilt by fleeing the jurisdiction after he was released on bail following his arrest on an unrelated matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Defendant's Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shay Jr. responded to the government's case by arguing that his statements about the bombing were unreliable, that the rest of the evidence failed to establish his guilt, and that other evidence suggested that Shay Sr. may have built the bomb.  His attack on the statements comprised three parts.  First, in an effort to demonstrate that he made the statements in order to fulfill a compulsive need for attention even though they were false, the defense elicited testimony from several witnesses that Shay Jr. regularly told the same grandiose stories, often changing significant details each time he told them;  repeatedly sought out the media to talk about the bombing even though it was not in his interest to do so;  made comments concerning the police investigation which were not confirmed by the police;  and expressed abnormal interest in the media attention he received as a result of his statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the defense attempted to show that Shay Jr.'s many statements about the bombing were conflicting and demonstrably wrong about important details that would have been known by a coconspirator.  In other words, as defense counsel stated in her summation, \"[Shay Jr.] may be trying to talk about this crime, but he doesn't make it.  He can't pull it off.  He doesn't have the facts right.\"   To illustrate this point, the defense pointed to Shay Jr.'s repeated and incorrect statements that the bomb contained C-4 explosive (or plastique) and batteries purchased from Radio Shack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defense attempted to call Dr. Robert Phillips, a psychiatrist, who was prepared to testify that Shay Jr. suffered from a recognized mental disorder known as \"pseudologia fantastica.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  According to Dr. Phillips, this condition caused Shay Jr. tospin out webs of lies which are ordinarily self-aggrandizing and serve to place him in the center of attention.  Put otherwise, coping for Mr. Shay, given his personality structure, entails seeking attention, tailoring his words to the audience, creating fantasies in which he is the central figure, and through which he attempts to enlist his audience....  Mr. Shay's stories are an attempt to draw others into his fantasy world in order to meet the interpersonal needs which were not met during his childhood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court prevented the defense from offering this testimony, concluding that the evidence should be excluded pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702 primarily because the jury was capable of determining the reliability of Shay Jr.'s statements without the testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A. Exclusion of Expert Testimony Concerning the Reliability of Shay Jr.'s Statements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In preventing Dr. Phillips from testifying, the district court relied on its discretionary authority pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702 to exclude expert testimony that will not \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"   Shay Jr. contends that the decision was based upon an erroneous interpretation of Rule 702.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The government argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence and alternatively asserts that the court was obligated to exclude the evidence as a matter of law because it concerned a credibility question that was the jury's exclusive province to resolve.  We first consider the government's argument for categorical exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Must expert testimony concerning credibility questions be excluded as a matter of law?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that expert testimony bearing directly on credibility questions is never admissible, the government relies on selected quotations from decisions in other circuits.  See, e.g., Bachman v. Leapley, 953 F.2d 440, 441 (8th Cir.1992) (\"It is the exclusive province of the jury to determine the believability of the witness ... [a]n expert is not permitted to offer an opinion as to the believability or truthfulness of a victim's story.\");  United States v. Benson, 941 F.2d 598, 604 (7th Cir.1991) (\"[c]redibility is not a proper subject for expert testimony\"), modified, 957 F.2d 301 (7th Cir.1992);  United States v. Barnard, 490 F.2d 907, 912 (9th Cir.1973) (\"[c]redibility, however, is for the jury--the jury is the lie detector in the courtroom\"), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 959, 94 S.Ct. 1976, 40 L.Ed.2d 310 (1974).  We think the government makes too much of these decisions.  Rather than requiring the wholesale exclusion of expert testimony concerning credibility issues, these cases stand for the more limited proposition that an expert's opinion that another witness is lying or telling the truth is ordinarily inadmissible pursuant to Rule 702 because the opinion exceeds the scope of the expert's specialized knowledge and therefore merely informs the jury that it should reach a particular conclusion.  See, e.g., Bachman, 953 F.2d at 441;  Benson, 941 F.2d at 604-05;  cf. Fed.R.Evid. 704 advisory committee's note (evidence can be excluded pursuant to Rule 702 if it \"would merely tell a jury what result to reach, somewhat in the manner of oath-helpers of an earlier day\").  In the present case, the district court precluded Dr. Phillips from testifying rather than merely limiting his testimony to matters that were within the scope of his expertise.  Thus, the decisions the government cites do not justify the court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's position is further undermined by the rules themselves which recognize that expert testimony may be admitted to establish a witness's character for truthfulness.  Fed.R.Evid. 402 provides that all relevant evidence is admissible unless its exclusion is required by the Constitution, an act of Congress, or another rule, and no constitutional provision, law, or rule requires the automatic exclusion of expert testimony simply because it concerns a credibility question.  See Margaret Berger, United States v. Scop:  The Common-Law Approach to an Expert's Opinion About a Witness's Credibility Still Does Not Work, 55 Brook.L.Rev. 558, 582-87 (1989).  Moreover, Fed.R.Evid. 608(a), governing the admissibility of opinion testimony concerning a witness's character, contemplates that truthful or untruthful character may be proved by expert testimony.  The advisory committee's note to Rule 608(a) references Fed.R.Evid. 405(a), which describes the acceptable methods for proving relevant character traits.  Fed.R.Evid. 608 advisory committee's note.  Rule 405's advisory committee's note, in turn, acknowledges that expert opinion testimony is to be included within Rule 405's scope.  Fed.R.Evid. 405(a) advisory committee's note (\"If character is defined as the kind of person one is, then account must be taken of the varying ways of arriving at the estimate.  These may range from the opinion of the employer who has found the man honest to the opinion of the psychiatrist based upon examination and testing.\").  Thus, the Federal Rules of Evidence permit expert testimony to be offered in appropriate circumstances to establish a witness's truthful or untruthful character.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's fall-back position is that even if expert testimony can be used to prove a testifying witness's untruthful character, it cannot be used to attack the reliability of a defendant's out-of-court statements because the defendant is a declarant, not a testifying witness.  This argument, too, is unavailing.

Thus, we will reverse a decision on this, or any other evidentiary question, only if:  (1) the district court based the decision on an incorrect legal standard, see United States v.

First, a proposed expert witness must be qualified to testify as an expert by \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 702;  accord United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 160 (1st Cir.1989) (\"a witness may qualify as an expert on any one of [Rule 702's] five listed grounds\").  Second, the expert's testimony must concern \"scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 702;  accord Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 2795, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (describing criteria to be considered in determining reliability of scientific testimony).  Finally, the testimony must \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 702;  accord Daubert, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2795.   Since the district court did not question Dr. Phillips's qualifications or the specialized nature of his opinions, we focus our analysis on Rule 702's assistance requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fundamental question that a court must answer in determining whether a proposed expert's testimony will assist the trier of fact is \" '[w]hether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best degree, the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a specialized understanding of the subject matter involved.' \"  United States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 783 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 702 advisory committee's note), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1986, 131 L.Ed.2d 873 (1995);  accord United States v.

In answering this question, the court must first determine whether the proposed testimony is relevant and fits the facts of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Daubert, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2795-96;  In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d at 742-43.   The inquiry then shifts to whether the witness's opinions are based upon specialized skill, training, or experience.  Benson, 941 F.2d at 604;  cf. Daubert, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2796 (relaxation of Fed.R.Evid. 602's first-hand knowledge requirement is justified for expert testimony because an \"expert's opinion will have a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline\").  Unless the witness's opinions are informed by expertise, they are no more helpful than the opinions of a lay witness.  Thus, such opinions cannot be admitted pursuant to Rule 702 and instead must comply with the requirements of Fed.R.Evid. 701 governing the admissibility of opinion testimony by lay witnesses.  See generally United States v. Jackman, 48 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1995) (describing standard for admissibility of opinion testimony by lay witness).  This circuit has not decided whether, after Daubert, reliable testimony from a qualified expert may be deemed unhelpful under Rule 702 even if these aspects of the rule's assistance requirement are satisfied.  But cf. In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d at 747 (noting that challenges to expert testimony as prejudicial must be analyzed pursuant to Rule 403 rather than Rule 702).  We need not resolve this question here because, as we describe in detail below, the district court's reasons for excluding the evidence are insufficient under any plausible reading of Rule 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The District Court's Analysis</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Phillips was prepared to testify that Shay Jr. suffered from a mental disorder that caused him to make grandiose statements similar in nature to the statements that the government was seeking to use against him.  The district court excluded the testimony because it concluded that the testimony would not assist the jury in light of other evidence in the record concerning the reliability of Shay Jr.'s statements.  However, whether or not the jury had the capacity to generally assess the reliability of these statements in light of the other evidence in the case, it plainly was unqualified to determine without assistance the particular issue of whether Shay Jr. may have made false statements against his own interests because he suffered from a mental disorder.  Common understanding conforms to the notion that a person ordinarily does not make untruthful inculpatory statements.  See Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3) advisory committee's note (statements against interest are especially reliable because \"persons do not make statements which are damaging to themselves unless satisfied for good reasons that they are true\").  Dr. Phillips would have testified that, contrary to this common sense assumption, Shay Jr. suffered from a recognized mental disorder that caused him to make false statements even though they were inconsistent with his apparent self-interest.  Thus, Dr. Phillips was prepared to offer specialized opinion testimony, grounded in his expertise as a psychiatrist, that could have \"explode[d] common myths\" about evidence vital to the government's case.  United States v. Moore, 786 F.2d 1308, 1312 (5th Cir.1986) (citations omitted).  While the record contains other evidence that Shay Jr. told lies and boasted to an unusual degree, this evidence, standing alone, is much less powerful than the psychiatric testimony that Dr. Phillips was prepared to offer.  Moreover, the court did not express any concern that Dr. Phillips was unqualified or that his testimony was unreliable because it concerned some novel or ad hoc syndrome.  Under all of the circumstances, it was a clear error in judgment for the district court to exclude the testimony under any plausible interpretation of Rule 702.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Is a new trial required?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a court may not exclude expert testimony simply because it concerns a credibility question or because non-expert testimony was presented on the same issue, it retains ample discretion to exclude or limit such testimony for other reasons.  Even if expert testimony is admissible pursuant to Rule 702, it may be disallowed pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 403 if its prejudicial, misleading, wasteful, confusing, or cumulative nature substantially outweighs its probative value.  As the Supreme Court recently observed, \" '[e]xpert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it.  Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice against probative force under Rule 403 of the present rules exercises more control over experts than over lay witnesses.' \"  Id. --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2798 (quoting Weinstein, Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is Sound;  It Should Not Be Amended, 138 F.R.D. 631, 632 (1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues on appeal that the district court's decision should be affirmed because Dr. Phillips's testimony does not sufficiently fit the facts of the case and because the potential prejudice resulting from his testimony substantially outweighs its probative value.  We are unable to address these arguments on the present record.  The district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing on these issues, nor did the court make any findings that would support the exclusion of the evidence for the reasons cited by the government.  Accordingly, the government's arguments must be addressed, in the first instance, by the district court on remand.  See United States v. Streifel, 781 F.2d 953, 958 (1st Cir.1986), appeal after remand sub nom., United States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that if the district court determines on remand that Dr. Phillips should have been permitted to testify, the exclusion of the testimony cannot be considered \"harmless error.\"   Although not all erroneous exclusions of evidence are harmful, where the exclusion \"results in actual prejudice because it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict,\" reversal is required.  United States v. Legarda, 17 F.3d 496, 499 (1st Cir.)  (internal quotations and citations omitted), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 81, 130 L.Ed.2d 34 (1994).  Here, the statements at issue were vital to the government's case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Moreover, although the court allowed Shay Jr. to indirectly attack the statements through other evidence, he was deprived of the opportunity to show that his statements were the unreliable product of a recognized mental disorder.  Given the importance of the statements to the government's case and the severe restriction placed on Shay Jr.'s ability to challenge them, we cannot say that the exclusion of Dr. Phillips's testimony did not substantially influence the jury's verdict.  See id.;  United States v. Versaint, 849 F.2d 827, 832 (3d Cir.1988) (error not harmless where improperly excluded evidence went to heart of the defense);  United States v. Ouimette, 753 F.2d 188, 193 (1st Cir.1985) (error not harmless because excluded testimony was \"the core of the defendant's case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

We examine these claims to determine whether a new trial is warranted irrespective of whether the court erred in preventing Shay Jr. from offering expert testimony to attack his statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Shay Jr.'s communications with his former attorney</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shay Jr.'s former attorney, William McPhee, testified as a defense witness that he received a copy of the Radio Shack receipt from the government and gave it to Shay Jr. in May of 1992, prior to Shay Jr. making any statements about having purchased the items from Radio Shack.  He was also permitted to testify that he and Shay Jr. had several discussions concerning the receipt.  However, Shay Jr. claims that the district court improperly prevented McPhee from also testifying that Shay Jr. told him that he had never seen the Radio Shack receipt before May 1992.  We conclude that Shay Jr. has forfeited his right to raise this contention on appeal because the record does not demonstrate that he adequately informed the court of the substance of the excluded evidence.  See Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McPhee's proposed testimony raised several evidentiary questions that the district court attempted to resolve in advance of his actual testimony.  Of particular concern to defense counsel was the extent to which the court would deem McPhee's testimony to result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege and open the door to cross-examination as to the substance of the communications.  In arguing that the testimony would not waive the privilege, defense counsel repeatedly informed the court that she did not propose to ask McPhee to describe the substance of his conversations with Shay Jr.  Further, in her voir dire examination, defense counsel, true to her word, limited her inquiry by not questioning McPhee concerning the substance of the communications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McPhee's testimony before the jury followed the path traveled on voir dire.

To the contrary, counsel's representations, both before and during the testimony, led the district court to reasonably conclude that the additional testimony defense counsel sought to elicit would only concern matters that had already been adequately covered.  Accordingly, Shay Jr. forfeited his right to challenge the excluded evidence on appeal by failing to inform the court in a timely manner of the substance of the excluded evidence.  Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2);  United States v. Bonneau, 970 F.2d 929, 933 (1st Cir.1992);  Earle v. Benoit, 850 F.2d 836, 847-48 n. 13 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The adequacy of the jury instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shay Jr. argues that the district court committed reversible error in failing to instruct the jury in accordance with his proposed instruction concerning the reliability of his statements.  Because Shay Jr. did not object to the court's failure to give the proposed instruction,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> we review the issue for \"plain error.\"  United States v. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 160-61 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1331, 127 L.Ed.2d 678 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a defendant has a right to an instruction on his theory of defense if that theory is valid and is supported by the record, United States v. Flores, 968 F.2d 1366, 1367 (1st Cir.1992), he \"has no right to put words in the judge's mouth.  So long as the charge sufficiently conveys the defendant's theory, it need not parrot the exact language that the defendant prefers.\"  United States v. McGill, 953 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir.1992);  accord Nason, 9 F.3d at 161 (reversible error only if instruction was substantially correct, was not covered in charge given, and failure to give it substantially impaired ability to present a defense).  In the present case, the district court's instructions adequately covered the general subject of witness credibility and the specific subject of the reliability of Shay Jr.'s statements.  Further, the instructions sufficiently conveyed the defendant's theory that based on the defendant's many contradictory statements, none of his statements should be found reliable.  Under these circumstances, it was not plain error for the court to refuse to give the requested instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Exclusion of expert testimony concerning diminished capacity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shay Jr.'s principal trial theory was that he was uninvolved in the bombing.  Nevertheless, prior to trial, he filed a notice pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.2 of his intention to offer expert testimony on the subjects of insanity and diminished capacity.  In later seeking to obtain a favorable ruling on a motion in limine, however, Shay Jr. informed the court that his \"lack of intent or knowledge [would not be] an issue.\"   Moreover, after the court denied his motion for a bifurcated trial on the issue of insanity, defense counsel informed the court that \"we will withdraw any questions about insanity because I believe quite clearly that it is not possible to defend on the merits and insanity at the same time.\"   Notwithstanding these representations, Shay Jr. informed the court on the 16th day of trial that he might seek to offer evidence on the subject of diminished capacity.  In prohibiting him from raising the issue, the court found that Shay Jr. had withdrawn his Rule 12.2 notice and that it would be \"unfair to the government at this late date to suddenly change horses again.\"   Shay Jr. challenges the court's finding that he withdrew his Rule 12.2 notice and therefore contends that the court erred in preventing him from offering expert testimony on the issue of diminished capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for abuse of discretion the trial court's determination that Shay Jr. withdrew his Rule 12.2 notice.  Cf. United States v. Cameron, 907 F.2d 1051, 1057 (11th Cir.1990) (applying abuse of discretion standard to district court decision not to recognize defendant's notice under Rule 12).  Since Shay Jr. informed the court after filing the Rule 12.2 notice that his knowledge or intent would not be an issue in the case and expressly withdrew his stated intention to pursue any issue of insanity, the record contains ample support for the district court's conclusion that Shay Jr. withdrew his Rule 12.2 notice.  Moreover, since Shay Jr. did not restate his intention to pursue a diminished capacity defense until the trial was well underway, we take no issue with the court's conclusion that it would be unfair to the government to allow Shay Jr. to attempt to offer evidence on the subject of diminished capacity.  Accordingly, we determine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in preventing Dr. Phillips from testifying on the subject of diminished capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

We need not define the outer limits of Shay Jr.'s Sixth Amendment rights in order to decide the present case because, at least in this instance, the Sixth Amendment offers Shay Jr. no greater protection than the rules of evidence.

In proving its case, the government relied in part on incriminating statements that Shay Jr. made to the police, the media, and fellow inmates.  The defendant responded by arguing that his statements were unreliable and should be disregarded.  In this opinion, we determine whether the court properly prevented the defendant from supporting his argument by calling a psychiatrist to testify that he suffered from a mental disorder that causes its victims to make false and grandiose statements without regard to the consequences.  We also address various other issues that the defendant raises on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>A. The Explosion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two officers from the Boston Police Department Bomb Squad were sent to the home of Shay Jr.'s father, Thomas Shay Sr., after Shay Sr. informed the police that he had discovered a suspicious black box in his driveway that had become dislodged from the undercarriage of his car.  While the officers were examining the box, it exploded, killing Officer Jeremiah Hurley and seriously wounding Officer Frances Foley.  Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, working with the Boston Police Department, later determined that the box contained two to three sticks of repackaged dynamite, a remote control device and other components necessary to detonate the bomb from a remote location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Government's Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's trial theory was that Shay Jr. conspired with a friend, Alfred Trenkler, to kill Shay Jr.'s father by blowing up his car.  In proving its case, the government relied primarily on several incriminating statements that Shay Jr. made after the bombing.  We describe his most damaging statements to illustrate their importance to the government's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Shortly after the bombing, Shay Jr. told a police officer, \"he was sorry about it and wished he could turn back the hands of time and make it not have happened.\"   The government argued at trial that this statement was evidence of Shay Jr.'s guilty conscience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Shay Jr. told reporters covering the bombing that he had been questioned about whether his father was capable of constructing a remote control device.  Because the police claimed that they did not question Shay Jr. about the bomb's remote control detonator until after Shay Jr. made this statement, the government argued that the statement demonstrated that Shay Jr. had special knowledge about the bomb that only a co-conspirator would possess.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Shay Jr. gave an interview to a television reporter in which he made several statements concerning the bombing.  Although he claimed in the interview that he was only guilty of knowing who had built the bomb after-the-fact, he admitted that Trenkler had told him before the bombing that he was planning a \"surprise\" for Shay Jr., which turned out to be the bomb.  Shay Jr. also acknowledged during the interview that he had purchased a toggle switch and an \"AA\" battery holder that Trenkler had used in building the bomb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Shay Jr. allegedly told a fellow cellmate, \"I'm boom, boom.  Don't you know me?   You have to know me.  I'm the one who killed the Boston cop.\"   According to the cellmate, Shay Jr. also told him that he and Trenkler had built the bomb together and attached it to the undercarriage of his father's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government supported Shay Jr.'s incriminating statements about the bombing with other evidence that:  (a) Trenkler and Shay Jr. were friends who were in sporadic contact from 1988 through the fall of 1991;  (b) Trenkler had the skill to construct the bomb;  (c) gray duct tape consistent with that in the bomb was discovered in a search of Trenkler's parents' residence;  (d) ten days prior to the explosion, someone purchased a toggle switch and \"AA\" battery holder of the same type used in the bomb from a Radio Shack store located directly across the street from where Trenkler was working;  (e) Radio Shack's records listed the purchaser's name as \"SAHY,\" and his identification number corresponding to the last four digits of his telephone number as \"3780,\" which was similar to the last four digits of Shay Sr.'s home telephone number, \"7380\";  (f) Shay Jr. was strongly motivated to kill his father because they had a difficult \"love-hate\" relationship, and Shay Jr. believed that he would collect a substantial inheritance if his father were killed;  and (g) Shay Jr. demonstrated consciousness of guilt by fleeing the jurisdiction after he was released on bail following his arrest on an unrelated matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Defendant's Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shay Jr. responded to the government's case by arguing that his statements about the bombing were unreliable, that the rest of the evidence failed to establish his guilt, and that other evidence suggested that Shay Sr. may have built the bomb.  His attack on the statements comprised three parts.  First, in an effort to demonstrate that he made the statements in order to fulfill a compulsive need for attention even though they were false, the defense elicited testimony from several witnesses that Shay Jr. regularly told the same grandiose stories, often changing significant details each time he told them;  repeatedly sought out the media to talk about the bombing even though it was not in his interest to do so;  made comments concerning the police investigation which were not confirmed by the police;  and expressed abnormal interest in the media attention he received as a result of his statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the defense attempted to show that Shay Jr.'s many statements about the bombing were conflicting and demonstrably wrong about important details that would have been known by a coconspirator.  In other words, as defense counsel stated in her summation, \"[Shay Jr.] may be trying to talk about this crime, but he doesn't make it.  He can't pull it off.  He doesn't have the facts right.\"   To illustrate this point, the defense pointed to Shay Jr.'s repeated and incorrect statements that the bomb contained C-4 explosive (or plastique) and batteries purchased from Radio Shack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defense attempted to call Dr. Robert Phillips, a psychiatrist, who was prepared to testify that Shay Jr. suffered from a recognized mental disorder known as \"pseudologia fantastica.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  According to Dr. Phillips, this condition caused Shay Jr. tospin out webs of lies which are ordinarily self-aggrandizing and serve to place him in the center of attention.  Put otherwise, coping for Mr. Shay, given his personality structure, entails seeking attention, tailoring his words to the audience, creating fantasies in which he is the central figure, and through which he attempts to enlist his audience....  Mr. Shay's stories are an attempt to draw others into his fantasy world in order to meet the interpersonal needs which were not met during his childhood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court prevented the defense from offering this testimony, concluding that the evidence should be excluded pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702 primarily because the jury was capable of determining the reliability of Shay Jr.'s statements without the testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A. Exclusion of Expert Testimony Concerning the Reliability of Shay Jr.'s Statements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In preventing Dr. Phillips from testifying, the district court relied on its discretionary authority pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702 to exclude expert testimony that will not \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"   Shay Jr. contends that the decision was based upon an erroneous interpretation of Rule 702.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The government argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence and alternatively asserts that the court was obligated to exclude the evidence as a matter of law because it concerned a credibility question that was the jury's exclusive province to resolve.  We first consider the government's argument for categorical exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Must expert testimony concerning credibility questions be excluded as a matter of law?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that expert testimony bearing directly on credibility questions is never admissible, the government relies on selected quotations from decisions in other circuits.  See, e.g., Bachman v. Leapley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575284\"><a href=\"/opinion/575284/david-jerome-bachman-v-walter-leapley-warden-south-dakota-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 441 (8th Cir.1992) (\"It is the exclusive province of the jury to determine the believability of the witness ...

Barnard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"316417\"><a href=\"/opinion/316417/united-states-v-buddy-joe-barnard/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 912 (9th Cir.1973) (\"[c]redibility, however, is for the jury--the jury is the lie detector in the courtroom\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span> </span>(1974).  We think the government makes too much of these decisions.  Rather than requiring the wholesale exclusion of expert testimony concerning credibility issues, these cases stand for the more limited proposition that an expert's opinion that another witness is lying or telling the truth is ordinarily inadmissible pursuant to Rule 702 because the opinion exceeds the scope of the expert's specialized knowledge and therefore merely informs the jury that it should reach a particular conclusion.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575284\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bachman,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/575284/david-jerome-bachman-v-walter-leapley-warden-south-dakota-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566377\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Benson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/566377/united-states-v-william-j-benson/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">604-05</span></a></span>;  cf. Fed.R.Evid. 704 advisory committee's note (evidence can be excluded pursuant to Rule 702 if it \"would merely tell a jury what result to reach, somewhat in the manner of oath-helpers of an earlier day\").  In the present case, the district court precluded Dr. Phillips from testifying rather than merely limiting his testimony to matters that were within the scope of his expertise.  Thus, the decisions the government cites do not justify the court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's position is further undermined by the rules themselves which recognize that expert testimony may be admitted to establish a witness's character for truthfulness.  Fed.R.Evid. 402 provides that all relevant evidence is admissible unless its exclusion is required by the Constitution, an act of Congress, or another rule, and no constitutional provision, law, or rule requires the automatic exclusion of expert testimony simply because it concerns a credibility question.  See Margaret Berger, United States v. Scop:  The Common-Law Approach to an Expert's Opinion About a Witness's Credibility Still Does Not Work, 55 Brook.L.Rev. 558, 582-87 (1989).  Moreover, Fed.R.Evid. 608(a), governing the admissibility of opinion testimony concerning a witness's character, contemplates that truthful or untruthful character may be proved by expert testimony.  The advisory committee's note to Rule 608(a) references Fed.R.Evid. 405(a), which describes the acceptable methods for proving relevant character traits.  Fed.R.Evid. 608 advisory committee's note.  Rule 405's advisory committee's note, in turn, acknowledges that expert opinion testimony is to be included within Rule 405's scope.  Fed.R.Evid. 405(a) advisory committee's note (\"If character is defined as the kind of person one is, then account must be taken of the varying ways of arriving at the estimate.  These may range from the opinion of the employer who has found the man honest to the opinion of the psychiatrist based upon examination and testing.\").

Thus, such opinions cannot be admitted pursuant to Rule 702 and instead must comply with the requirements of Fed.R.Evid. 701 governing the admissibility of opinion testimony by lay witnesses.

The District Court's Analysis</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Phillips was prepared to testify that Shay Jr. suffered from a mental disorder that caused him to make grandiose statements similar in nature to the statements that the government was seeking to use against him.  The district court excluded the testimony because it concluded that the testimony would not assist the jury in light of other evidence in the record concerning the reliability of Shay Jr.'s statements.  However, whether or not the jury had the capacity to generally assess the reliability of these statements in light of the other evidence in the case, it plainly was unqualified to determine without assistance the particular issue of whether Shay Jr. may have made false statements against his own interests because he suffered from a mental disorder.  Common understanding conforms to the notion that a person ordinarily does not make untruthful inculpatory statements.  See Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3) advisory committee's note (statements against interest are especially reliable because \"persons do not make statements which are damaging to themselves unless satisfied for good reasons that they are true\").  Dr. Phillips would have testified that, contrary to this common sense assumption, Shay Jr. suffered from a recognized mental disorder that caused him to make false statements even though they were inconsistent with his apparent self-interest.  Thus, Dr. Phillips was prepared to offer specialized opinion testimony, grounded in his expertise as a psychiatrist, that could have \"explode[d] common myths\" about evidence vital to the government's case.  United States v. Moore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"467487\"><a href=\"/opinion/467487/united-states-v-michael-r-moore-larry-p-moore-and-beverly-k-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">786</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></a></span>, 1312 (5th Cir.1986) (citations omitted).  While the record contains other evidence that Shay Jr. told lies and boasted to an unusual degree, this evidence, standing alone, is much less powerful than the psychiatric testimony that Dr. Phillips was prepared to offer.  Moreover, the court did not express any concern that Dr. Phillips was unqualified or that his testimony was unreliable because it concerned some novel or ad hoc syndrome.  Under all of the circumstances, it was a clear error in judgment for the district court to exclude the testimony under any plausible interpretation of Rule 702.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Even if expert testimony is admissible pursuant to Rule 702, it may be disallowed pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 403 if its prejudicial, misleading, wasteful, confusing, or cumulative nature substantially outweighs its probative value.  As the Supreme Court recently observed, \" '[e]xpert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it.  Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice against probative force under Rule 403 of the present rules exercises more control over experts than over lay witnesses.' \"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"467487\"><a href=\"/opinion/467487/united-states-v-michael-r-moore-larry-p-moore-and-beverly-k-moore/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> --- U.S. </a></span>at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We are unable to address these arguments on the present record.  The district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing on these issues, nor did the court make any findings that would support the exclusion of the evidence for the reasons cited by the government.  Accordingly, the government's arguments must be addressed, in the first instance, by the district court on remand.  See United States v.

Here, the statements at issue were vital to the government's case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Moreover, although the court allowed Shay Jr. to indirectly attack the statements through other evidence, he was deprived of the opportunity to show that his statements were the unreliable product of a recognized mental disorder.

He was also permitted to testify that he and Shay Jr. had several discussions concerning the receipt.  However, Shay Jr. claims that the district court improperly prevented McPhee from also testifying that Shay Jr. told him that he had never seen the Radio Shack receipt before May 1992.  We conclude that Shay Jr. has forfeited his right to raise this contention on appeal because the record does not demonstrate that he adequately informed the court of the substance of the excluded evidence.

Of particular concern to defense counsel was the extent to which the court would deem McPhee's testimony to result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege and open the door to cross-examination as to the substance of the communications.

Exclusion of expert testimony concerning diminished capacity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shay Jr.'s principal trial theory was that he was uninvolved in the bombing.  Nevertheless, prior to trial, he filed a notice pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.2 of his intention to offer expert testimony on the subjects of insanity and diminished capacity.  In later seeking to obtain a favorable ruling on a motion in limine, however, Shay Jr. informed the court that his \"lack of intent or knowledge [would not be] an issue.\"   Moreover, after the court denied his motion for a bifurcated trial on the issue of insanity, defense counsel informed the court that \"we will withdraw any questions about insanity because I believe quite clearly that it is not possible to defend on the merits and insanity at the same time.\"   Notwithstanding these representations, Shay Jr. informed the court on the 16th day of trial that he might seek to offer evidence on the subject of diminished capacity.  In prohibiting him from raising the issue, the court found that Shay Jr. had withdrawn his Rule 12.2 notice and that it would be \"unfair to the government at this late date to suddenly change horses again.\"   Shay Jr. challenges the court's finding that he withdrew his Rule 12.2 notice and therefore contends that the court erred in preventing him from offering expert testimony on the issue of diminished capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for abuse of discretion the trial court's determination that Shay Jr. withdrew his Rule 12.2 notice.  Cf. United States v.

Since Shay Jr. informed the court after filing the Rule 12.2 notice that his knowledge or intent would not be an issue in the case and expressly withdrew his stated intention to pursue any issue of insanity, the record contains ample support for the district court's conclusion that Shay Jr. withdrew his Rule 12.2 notice.  Moreover, since Shay Jr. did not restate his intention to pursue a diminished capacity defense until the trial was well underway, we take no issue with the court's conclusion that it would be unfair to the government to allow Shay Jr. to attempt to offer evidence on the subject of diminished capacity.  Accordingly, we determine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in preventing Dr. Phillips from testifying on the subject of diminished capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.
