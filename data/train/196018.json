After carefully considering her\n\nplaints, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          On August 11, 1992,  appellant, a citizen of  New York,\n\ntraveled to Puerto Rico.  She registered as a guest at La Concha.\n\nAt 10:30  that evening,  while exiting  the piano  bar, appellant\n\nslipped on the second step of a small, carpeted stairway.  Having\n\nneglected  to  use the  handrail,  she  plummeted to  the  floor,\n\nposterior  first, sustaining  a fractured  right ankle  and other\n\ninjuries.\n\n          Invoking  diversity  jurisdiction,  28  U.S.C.     1332\n\n(1988),  appellant brought  suit  in the  United States  District\n\nCourt for  the District of  Puerto Rico.   In her  complaint, she\n\nposited  two theories  of  tortious conduct  under Puerto  Rico's\n\ngeneral negligence  statute,2  alleging that  the defendants  not\n\nonly failed to  keep the  stairs free of  foreign substances  but\n\nalso inadequately illuminated them.  The first allegation stemmed\n                    \r                              \n\n     1For  simplicity's sake,  we  do not  distinguish among  the\nentities that have been  sued, but refer to them  collectively as\n\"the defendants.\"\n\n     2The statute provides in pertinent part:\n               A person who by an  act or omission\n               causes  damage  to another  through\n               fault   or   negligence  shall   be\n               obliged  to  repair  the damage  so\n               done. . . . \nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   5141 (1991).\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nfrom  appellant's claim  that  the stairs,  at  the time  of  her\n\ntumble, were suffused with some sort of liquid (an inference that\n\nshe drew  from  the dampness  in  her  pants and  on  her  person\n\nfollowing her spill).\n\n          Trial commenced on April 20, 1994.  At the close of the\n\nplaintiff's case,  the judge remarked that  visiting the accident\n\nscene  might assist the jury.   When neither  party objected, the\n\njudge ordered a view to take place at approximately 7:00 p.m.  In\n\nimplementing the order, the judge provided very little structure.\n\nHe neglected to give  the jurors any detailed instructions  or to\n\nenlist the  court reporter's  participation.  Once  the entourage\n\nreached La  Concha, the jurors conversed  freely among themselves\n\nand at least  one juror touched foot  to stair.  It  is alleged  \n\nthough disputed   that the jurors also spoke with the judge.\n\n          Despite these  informalities, appellant did  not object\n\nat  any point before or during the  view, nor did she solicit any\n\njury  instructions concerning the  view, nor did  she request the\n\npresence  of a  reporter.   It was  not until  the next  day that\n\nappellant  for   the  first  time  objected  to   the  view  and,\n\nconcomitantly, moved  for a  mistrial.   The judge  overruled her\n\nobjection and  denied her motion.   Even then,  appellant neither\n\nasked  to interview the jurors nor requested any sort of curative\n\ninstruction.\n\n          At the  close of all  the evidence, the  district court\n\ndefenestrated the  claim  of careless  maintenance, granting  the\n\ndefendants'  motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R.\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nCiv. P. 50(a), and sent the case to the jury only on the parallel\n\nclaim  of poor illumination.  Appellant did  not ask the court to\n\ncomment  on   the  evidentiary  status   of  the   view  in   its\n\ninstructions,  and the court did not do  so.  The jury returned a\n\ndefendants' verdict.\n\n          Before  us,  appellant asserts  that  the jury  verdict\n\nshould  be set aside because the defects associated with the view\n\nwarranted a  mistrial.   Additionally, she assigns  error to  the\n\ndistrict court's handling of her negligent maintenance claim.  We\n\ntake these grievances one step at a time.\n\nII.  THE VIEW\r          II.  THE VIEW\n\n          Appellant's principal assignment  of error features the\n\ndistrict  court's denial  of  her motion  for  a mistrial.    The\n\nasseveration rests  on the  premise that defects  associated with\n\nthe  view required a new beginning.  Thus, the question presented\n\nreduces, in the first instance, to the status of the view itself.\n\n          In  order to secure  our footing, we  begin with common\n\nground:   a federal  court, exercising  its inherent  powers, may\n\nallow a  jury in either a civil or a criminal case to view places\n\nor objects outside the  courtroom.  See United States  v. Passos-\r                                                                           \n\nPaternina, 918 F.2d 979,  986 (1st Cir. 1990), cert.  denied, 499\r                                                                      \n\nU.S.  982 (1991), and cert.  denied, 501 U.S.  1209, 1210 (1991).\r                                             \n\nWhether to  permit  a jury  to  conduct a  view  in a  particular\n\nsituation is a question  committed to the trial court's  informed\n\ndiscretion.  See United States v. Pettiford, 962 F.2d 74, 76 (1st\r                                                     \n\nCir. 1992); United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 30-31 (1st Cir.\r                                              \n\n                                4\r\r\n\n1984);  see generally Hulen D. Wendorf, Some Views on Jury Views,\r                                                                          \n\n15  Baylor  L.  Rev.  379,  390-92  (1963)  (cataloguing  several\n\nconsiderations  that  may  enter  into  a  judge's  discretionary\n\ndecision to grant or deny a view).\n\n          Though  discretionary  at  the  outset,  a  view,  once\n\nauthorized,   should   embody  certain   fundamental  safeguards.\n\nCollectively, these  safeguards are  aimed at achieving  fairness\n\nand maximizing  the trial's  truth-seeking function.   We limn  a\n\nfive-step protocol that a  court customarily should follow before\n\nand during a view.\n\n          First, counsel should be alerted to  a proposed view at\n\nthe  earliest practicable  time  and given  an opportunity  to be\n\nheard concerning  it.    See John  R.  Allison,  Combinations  of\r                                                                           \n\nDecision-Making  Functions, Ex Parte  Communications, and Related\r                                                                           \n\nBiasing Influences:   A Process-Value Analysis, 1993 Utah L. Rev.\r                                                        \n\n1135, 1218-19.\n\n          Second, because the rule in this circuit is that a view\n\ndoes not itself constitute or  generate evidence, the jury should\n\nbe instructed prior to embarking on the view that the view itself\n\nis not evidence  as such, but,  rather, is simply a  mechanism to\n\nfacilitate  contextualization of the evidence.3   See 1 Edward J.\r                                                               \n                    \r                              \n\n     3While  this position  represents the  majority view,  see 2\r                                                                         \nJohn W.  Strong et al., McCormick  on Evidence   216,  at 27 (4th\r                                                        \ned.  1992)  (noting  that  \"[a] large  number  of  jurisdictions,\nprobably  a majority, holds that a view is not itself evidence\"),\nsome  courts   have  ruled  to  the   contrary,  particularly  in\nconnection  with  bench  trials.   See,  e.g.,  Lillie v.  United\r                                                                           \nStates, 953 F.2d 1188, 1190 (10th Cir. 1992) (stating that a view\r                \nin a bench trial  is evidence, though acknowledging cases  to the\ncontrary).   But see Processteel,  Inc. v. Mosley  Mach. Co., 421\r                                                                      \n\n                                5\r\r\n\nDevitt  et al., Federal Jury Practice and Instructions   5.14, at\r                                                                \n\n133 (1992) (\"Ordinarily,  when the  jury takes a  view the  court\n\nexplicitly instructs them that they are not to consider what they\n\nsee as evidence in a case, but that  the view is merely to enable\n\nthem to apply  the evidence in the case.\").   Upon timely request\n\nof  either party, the court should include a similar statement in\n\nits final charge.\n\n          Third,  counsel  should  be given  the  opportunity  to\n\nattend the view, although the judge may, in his discretion, place\n\nlimits on their interaction with the subject of the view and with\n\nthe jurors.  See 2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on Evidence  \r                                                                         \n\n216, at 26 (4th ed. 1992); Allison, supra, at 1218-19.\r                                                   \n\n          Fourth, because the  judge's oversight is  as necessary\n\nat a  view  as in  the  course of  the  trial proper,  the  judge\n\nordinarily should attend the  view.  See 2 Strong  et al., supra,\r                                                                          \n\nat 27; Allison, supra, at 1219; Wendorf, supra, at 393.\r                                                        \n\n          Fifth, the court should employ some method of fully and\n\naccurately recording  that which transpires at  the view, usually\n\nby enlisting the  attendance of a court reporter.   See Lillie v.\r                                                                        \n\nUnited  States, 953 F.2d 1188, 1191 (10th Cir. 1992) (noting that\r                        \n\nwhere  \"there is  no  record  of  the  view,  the  litigants  may\n\neffectively  be  denied  any  means  of  challenge  on  appeal\");\n\nAllison, supra, at 1219-20.  \r                        \n\n          We add  a caveat:   the  list we  have compiled is  not\n                    \r                              \n\nF.2d 1074, 1076 (6th  Cir. 1970) (disapproving of \"a  fact finder\nusing  visual inspection  .  . .  in  the place  of  testimony to\nresolve factual issues\").\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nintended to be exhaustive or inflexible.  There may very well  be\n\nother   precautions,   not   recounted   above,    that   deserve\n\nconsideration in  the particular  circumstances of a  given case.\n\nSimilarly,  while the enumerated  procedures ordinarily should be\n\nemployed,  we are  reluctant to  impose a  rigid format  upon the\n\ntrial  bench.   Thus,  if circumstances  warrant,  the court  may\n\ninnovate  (even  if  innovation necessitates  departing  from the\n\nlist).\n\n          Last  but not  least, we  emphasize that  the onus  for\n\nimplementing these safeguards does  not rest exclusively upon the\n\ntrial judge.   When a  judge orders  a view but  strays from  the\n\nprophylaxis  that should  accompany  it, an  offended party  must\n\nbring  the  omissions to  the  judge's  attention  in  a  timeous\n\nfashion,  and, if necessary, lodge a formal objection.  A party's\n\nfailure to take appropriate action will, in most cases, foreclose\n\nan appeal predicated on the omission of standard safeguards.\n\n          The case  at bar  vividly illustrates this  last point.\n\nAlthough  the  court ignored  some  of  the standard  safeguards,\n\nappellant  did not preserve her right to contest the propriety of\n\nwhat transpired.   Before the  fact, appellant acquiesced  in the\n\ncourt's suggestion that the jury observe the accident scene.  She\n\nfailed  either to request that a court stenographer be present or\n\nto  object when the judge  did not spontaneously  arrange for the\n\nreporter's attendance.   And,  she compounded these  omissions by\n\nnot asking that the jurors be given explicative instructions.\n\n          To make  a bad situation  worse, appellant's  lassitude\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ncontinued after the  view had  been completed.   Though she  made\n\nspeculative  allegations  of  misconduct  when she  moved  for  a\n\nmistrial, she  neither sought an  opportunity to  conduct a  voir\n\ndire  in  order  to  transform  conjecture  into  hard  fact  nor\n\nrequested  a curative  instruction  to alleviate  potential harm.\n\nGiven  this history  of inattention,  the record simply  will not\n\nsupport appellant's assignment  of error.   See, e.g., Reilly  v.\r                                                                       \n\nUnited  States, 863 F.2d 149,  160 (1st Cir.  1988) (stating rule\r                        \n\nthat  \"when a trial judge  announces a proposed  course of action\n\nwhich   litigants   believe   to   be  erroneous,   the   parties\n\ndetrimentally affected  must act expeditiously to  call the error\n\nto the judge's  attention or  to cure the  defect\"); Merchant  v.\r                                                                       \n\nRuhle,  740 F.2d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 1984) (warning against attempts\r               \n\nto convert \"agreeable acquiescence  to perceivable error [into] a\n\nweapon of  appellate advocacy\");  see generally United  States v.\r                                                                        \n\nCamporeale,  515  F.2d 184,  188 (2d  Cir. 1975)  (observing that\r                    \n\n\"normally the failure  of counsel to register a  timely objection\n\nto the submission of improper evidence to the jury will be deemed\n\na waiver\").\n\n          Appellant's   eleventh-hour   motion   to   abort   the\n\nproceedings did not miraculously cure the sapping effects of this\n\nstring of waivers.  Parties cannot casually forgo contemporaneous\n\nobjections   and  then  make  up  lost  ground  by  means  of  an\n\nafterthought  motion for mistrial.   Such a motion is not a ready\n\nsubstitute for a timely  objection.  See, e.g., United  States v.\r                                                                        \n\nTropeano,  476 F.2d 586,  587-88 (1st Cir.)

See Saville, 400 F.2d at 400 (explaining that\r                                         \n\n\"`the burden is  on the  [adversely affected party]  to take  his\n\nobjection at the earliest possible opportunity when, by so doing,\n\nhe  can enable  the  trial judge  to  take the  most  efficacious\n\naction'\") (quoting Holden v. United  States, 388 F.2d 240, 242-43\r                                                     \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 864 (1968)).\r                                  \n\n          Although   appellant  waived   any  objection   to  the\n\nimplementation of the jury view, we note that, in all events, the\n\nalleged errors  seem benign.  Appellant  describes four potential\n\nsources  of prejudice:  (1) that  the judge  did not  utilize the\n\nservices  of a court reporter or some other means of recordation;\n\n(2) that  the judge may have  conversed with the  jury during the\n\nview;  (3) that one or  more jurors may  have \"experimented\" with\n\nthe stairway in an attempt to recreate the accident; and (4) that\n\nthe lighting and condition  of the stairway during the  view were\n\nmaterially different than at  the time of the accident.   None of\n\nthese allegations succeeds.\n\n           The absence of  a court reporter, though  ill-advised,\n\nbears no obvious relationship  to the outcome of this  case, and,\n\nhence, it  cannot,  without more,  be  deemed prejudicial.    See\r                                                                           \n\n                                9\r\r\n\nNorthwestern Nat'l Casualty Co. v.

Similarly,  there  is no\n\nindication  that the judge's alleged interaction  with the jury  \n\nwhich,  if it  occurred at  all, evidently  consisted of  a juror\n\nasking  the  judge  if  the  bar  lights  could  be  activated   \n\nprejudiced appellant's  substantial rights.

See Wendorf, supra, at 394  (\"In\r                                                             \nthe exercise of sound judicial discretion, it may on occasion . .\n. be useful to permit the conduct of  experiments at the view.\").\nOn this sketchy  record, there is  no principled way that  we can\nfind an abuse of discretion in the court's implied consent to the\nanonymous juror's modest experiment.\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nappellant's conclusory allegation that the conditions surrounding\n\nthe staircase  during the view were  \"dramatically different than\n\nthose conditions at the time of the accident\"  falls far short of\n\nestablishing that any prejudicial  error actually resulted.5  See\r                                                                           \n\nNorthwestern Nat'l Casualty, 533 F.2d at 323 (upholding jury view\r                                     \n\neven though \"the  appearance of  the site had  changed since  the\n\nrelevant events\"); Martin v.

Because\n\nappellant neither  preserved her  rights nor demonstrated  actual\n\nprejudice, we are unable to say that the lower court, in refusing\n\na mistrial, abused its  discretion.

THE DIRECTED VERDICT\r          III.  THE DIRECTED VERDICT\n\n          Appellant also  contends that the trial  court erred in\n\ngranting judgment  as  a matter  of  law on  her claim  that  the\n\ndefendants negligently  tolerated  a hazardous  condition on  the\n\nhotel's  premises.   Appellant concedes  that a  hotel is  not an\n\ninsurer  of a guest's safety.  Nonetheless, she argues that there\n\nwas  enough evidence  for  a  rational  jury  to  find  that  the\n\ndefendants knew or  should have known of the  foreign substance's\n\npresence on the stairs in ample time to remove it.\n\n          Appellant  adduced  no proof  that  the  defendants had\n\nactual notice  of the danger.   Her claim  compresses, therefore,\n\ninto a claim premised  on constructive notice.  Her  basic theory\n\nis that the jury  plausibly could have inferred that a liquid was\n\non  the stairs for  a period of  time sufficient  for the hotel's\n\nstaff to have discovered and removed it.  We do not agree.\n\n          A district court may  grant a motion for judgment  as a\n\nmatter of law  \"[i]f during a  trial by a jury  a party has  been\n\nfully  heard on  an  issue and  there  is no  legally  sufficient\n\nevidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on\n\nthat  issue,\" and  the  party's entire  claim  \"cannot under  the\n\ncontrolling law be maintained  . . . without a  favorable finding\n\non that issue.\"   Fed. R.  Civ. P. 50(a)(1).   In executing  this\n\nstandard, the  trial  court \"must  scrutinize the  proof and  the\n\ninferences  reasonably to  be drawn  therefrom in the  light most\n\nhospitable  to  the  nonmovant .  .  .  [and]  must refrain  from\n\ndifferential factfinding;  that is  to say, the  court must  `not\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nconsider  the  credibility  of witnesses,  resolve  conflicts  in\n\ntestimony,  or evaluate  the weight  of the  evidence.'\"   Rolon-\r                                                                           \n\nAlvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d  74, 76-77 (1st Cir.\r                                              \n\n1993)  (quoting Wagenmann v.

Because  \"the  court  of  appeals  is  constrained  in\n\nprecisely  the same  fashion  as the  district court  . .  ., and\n\nbecause the key question revolves around the legal sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence, appellate review is plenary.\"  Id. at 77.\r                                                          \n\n          In the  instant case,  appellant offered  some evidence\n\nfrom which a  factfinder could  have concluded that  there was  a\n\nforeign substance on the  staircase.  Yet, she failed  to produce\n\nany  evidence sufficient to allow a  reasonable jury to determine\r             \n\nthat  the   hotel  had  constructive  notice   of  the  hazardous\n\ncondition.   The dampness  on her clothing may  tend to prove the\n\npresence of a foreign substance on the stairs, but it does not in\n\nany way demonstrate how  long the substance may have  been there.\n\nThe  personality  profile of  the  hotel  is  a two-edged  sword;\n\nalthough  appellant says that the size of the complex, the number\n\nof  waitpersons, and the scarcity of janitorial help show both an\n\nenhanced  likelihood  of spillage  and  a  diminished ability  to\n\ndiscover incipient  dangers, the same  facts also  show that  the\n\nsubstance  could have emanated from  various sources at a variety\n\nof times.    In short,  there  is nothing  at  all from  which  a\n\nrational  juror could  do  more than  guess  about how  long  the\n\nsubstance may have been in situ.\r                                         \n\n          This deficiency causes appellant's claim to stumble  on\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nour decision  in Mas  v. United States,  984 F.2d  527 (1st  Cir.\r                                                \n\n1993).   In Mas, as  here, the  law of Puerto  Rico governed  the\r                         \n\nissue.    There, we  affirmed the  lower  court's dismissal  of a\n\npersonal injury action    in that case, the plaintiff  claimed to\n\nhave slipped  on a small puddle of spilt  milk on the floor of an\n\narmy  commissary   on the ground that the proof failed adequately\n\nto  demonstrate that the defendant  knew or should  have known of\n\nthe  supposedly dangerous condition.   In so doing,  we held that\n\nthe very same  statute upon which appellant's  suit depends, P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 31,   5141, quoted supra note 2,  \"requires, as an\r                                                 \n\nelement,  an  affirmative  showing  by  the  plaintiff  that  the\n\ndefendant  . . . ha[d] either actual or constructive knowledge of\n\na dangerous condition.\"  Mas, 984 F.2d at 530.  So it is here.6\r                                      \n\n          We need go no further.   In this instance, even if  the\n\njury believed that a  liquid saturated the stairway, there  is no\n\nevidence from which it  sensibly could infer how long  the liquid\n\nhad been on the stairs.   Because that is so, the  jury could not\n\nhave drawn a reasonable inference  that defendants knew or should\n\nhave known of the  liquid's existence in sufficient time  to have\n\nremoved it before  Clemente appeared  on the scene.   It  follows\n                    \r                              \n\n     6Appellant's   reliance  on  Colon   Miranda  v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 1992, appellant, a citizen of New York, traveled to Puerto Rico.  She registered as a guest at La Concha.  At 10:30 that evening, while exiting the piano bar, appellant slipped on the second step of a small, carpeted stairway.  Having neglected to use the handrail, she plummeted to the floor, posterior first, sustaining a fractured right ankle and other injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), appellant brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  In her complaint, she posited two theories of tortious conduct under Puerto Rico's general negligence statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> alleging that the defendants not only failed to keep the stairs free of foreign substances but also inadequately illuminated them.  The first allegation stemmed from appellant's claim that the stairs, at the time of her tumble, were suffused with some sort of liquid (an inference that she drew from the dampness in her pants and on her person following her spill).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial commenced on April 20, 1994.  At the close of the plaintiff's case, the judge remarked that visiting the accident scene might assist the jury.  When neither party objected, the judge ordered a view to take place at approximately 7:00 p.m.  In implementing the order, the judge provided very little structure.  He neglected to give the jurors any detailed instructions or to enlist the court reporter's participation.  Once the entourage reached La Concha, the jurors conversed freely among themselves and at least one juror touched foot to stair.  It is alleged--though disputed--that the jurors also spoke with the judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these informalities, appellant did not object at any point before or during the view, nor did she solicit any jury instructions concerning the view, nor did she request the presence of a reporter.  It was not until the next day that appellant for the first time objected to the view and, concomitantly, moved for a mistrial.  The judge overruled her objection and denied her motion.  Even then, appellant neither asked to interview the jurors nor requested any sort of curative instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of all the evidence, the district court defenestrated the claim of careless maintenance, granting the defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), and sent the case to the jury only on the parallel claim of poor illumination.  Appellant did not ask the court to comment on the evidentiary status of the view in its instructions, and the court did not do so.  The jury returned a defendants' verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, appellant asserts that the jury verdict should be set aside because the defects associated with the view warranted a mistrial.  Additionally, she assigns error to the district court's handling of her negligent maintenance claim.  We take these grievances one step at a time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE VIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's principal assignment of error features the district court's denial of her motion for a mistrial.  The asseveration rests on the premise that defects associated with the view required a new beginning.  Thus, the question presented reduces, in the first instance, to the status of the view itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to secure our footing, we begin with common ground:  a federal court, exercising its inherent powers, may allow a jury in either a civil or a criminal case to view places or objects outside the courtroom.

Passos-Paternina, 918 F.2d 979, 986 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 982, 111 S.Ct. 1637, 113 L.Ed.2d 732 (1991), and cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1209, 111 S.Ct. 2808, 115 L.Ed.2d 980, 501 U.S. 1210, 111 S.Ct. 2809, 115 L.Ed.2d 981 (1991).  Whether to permit a jury to conduct a view in a particular situation is a question committed to the trial court's informed discretion.  See United States v. Pettiford, 962 F.2d 74, 76 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 30-31 (1st Cir.1984);  see generally Hulen D. Wendorf, Some Views on Jury Views, 15 Baylor L.Rev. 379, 390-92 (1963) (cataloguing several considerations that may enter into a judge's discretionary decision to grant or deny a view).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though discretionary at the outset, a view, once authorized, should embody certain fundamental safeguards.  Collectively, these safeguards are aimed at achieving fairness and maximizing the trial's truth-seeking function.  We limn a five-step protocol that a court customarily should follow before and during a view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, counsel should be alerted to a proposed view at the earliest practicable time and given an opportunity to be heard concerning it.  See John R. Allison, Combinations of Decision-Making Functions, Ex Parte Communications, and Related Biasing Influences:  A Process-Value Analysis, 1993 Utah L.Rev. 1135, 1218-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, because the rule in this circuit is that a view does not itself constitute or generate evidence, the jury should be instructed prior to embarking on the view that the view itself is not evidence as such, but, rather, is simply a mechanism to facilitate contextualization of the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See 1 Edward J. Devitt et al., Federal Jury Practice and Instructions Sec. 5.14, at 133 (1992) (\"Ordinarily, when the jury takes a view the court explicitly instructs them that they are not to consider what they see as evidence in a case, but that the view is merely to enable them to apply the evidence in the case.\").  Upon timely request of either party, the court should include a similar statement in its final charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, counsel should be given the opportunity to attend the view, although the judge may, in his discretion, place limits on their interaction with the subject of the view and with the jurors.  See 2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on Evidence Sec. 216, at 26 (4th ed. 1992);  Allison, supra, at 1218-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, because the judge's oversight is as necessary at a view as in the course of the trial proper, the judge ordinarily should attend the view.  See 2 Strong et al., supra, at 27;  Allison, supra, at 1219;  Wendorf, supra, at 393.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, the court should employ some method of fully and accurately recording that which transpires at the view, usually by enlisting the attendance of a court reporter.  See Lillie v. United States, 953 F.2d 1188, 1191 (10th Cir.1992) (noting that where \"there is no record of the view, the litigants may effectively be denied any means of challenge on appeal\");  Allison, supra, at 1219-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a caveat:  the list we have compiled is not intended to be exhaustive or inflexible.  There may very well be other precautions, not recounted above, that deserve consideration in the particular circumstances of a given case.  Similarly, while the enumerated procedures ordinarily should be employed, we are reluctant to impose a rigid format upon the trial bench.  Thus, if circumstances warrant, the court may innovate (even if innovation necessitates departing from the list).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last but not least, we emphasize that the onus for implementing these safeguards does not rest exclusively upon the trial judge.  When a judge orders a view but strays from the prophylaxis that should accompany it, an offended party must bring the omissions to the judge's attention in a timeous fashion, and, if necessary, lodge a formal objection.  A party's failure to take appropriate action will, in most cases, foreclose an appeal predicated on the omission of standard safeguards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at bar vividly illustrates this last point.  Although the court ignored some of the standard safeguards, appellant did not preserve her right to contest the propriety of what transpired.  Before the fact, appellant acquiesced in the court's suggestion that the jury observe the accident scene.  She failed either to request that a court stenographer be present or to object when the judge did not spontaneously arrange for the reporter's attendance.  And, she compounded these omissions by not asking that the jurors be given explicative instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make a bad situation worse, appellant's lassitude continued after the view had been completed.  Though she made speculative allegations of misconduct when she moved for a mistrial, she neither sought an opportunity to conduct a voir dire in order to transform conjecture into hard fact nor requested a curative instruction to alleviate potential harm.  Given this history of inattention, the record simply will not support appellant's assignment of error.  See, e.g., Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 160 (1st Cir.1988) (stating rule that \"when a trial judge announces a proposed course of action which litigants believe to be erroneous, the parties detrimentally affected must act expeditiously to call the error to the judge's attention or to cure the defect\");  Merchant v. Ruhle, 740 F.2d 86, 92 (1st Cir.1984) (warning against attempts to convert \"agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error [into] a weapon of appellate advocacy\");  see generally United States v. Camporeale, 515 F.2d 184, 188 (2d Cir.1975) (observing that \"normally the failure of counsel to register a timely objection to the submission of improper evidence to the jury will be deemed a waiver\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's eleventh-hour motion to abort the proceedings did not miraculously cure the sapping effects of this string of waivers.  Parties cannot casually forgo contemporaneous objections and then make up lost ground by means of an afterthought motion for mistrial.  Such a motion is not a ready substitute for a timely objection.  See, e.g., United States v. Tropeano, 476 F.2d 586, 587-88 (1st Cir.)  (upholding denial of motion for mistrial where movant forwent several earlier opportunities to correct alleged error), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 839, 94 S.Ct. 90, 38 L.Ed.2d 75 (1973);  Saville v. United States, 400 F.2d 397, 400 (1st Cir.1968) (similar), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 980, 89 S.Ct. 2137, 23 L.Ed.2d 768 (1969).  A contrary rule would inject gross unpredictability into trials, would be unfair to diligent litigants, and would seriously undermine judicial economy.  See Saville, 400 F.2d at 400 (explaining that \" 'the burden is on the [adversely affected party] to take his objection at the earliest possible opportunity when, by so doing, he can enable the trial judge to take the most efficacious action' \") (quoting Holden v. United States, 388 F.2d 240, 242-43 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 864, 89 S.Ct. 146, 21 L.Ed.2d 132 (1968)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellant waived any objection to the implementation of the jury view, we note that, in all events, the alleged errors seem benign.  Appellant describes four potential sources of prejudice:  (1) that the judge did not utilize the services of a court reporter or some other means of recordation;  (2) that the judge may have conversed with the jury during the view;  (3) that one or more jurors may have \"experimented\" with the stairway in an attempt to recreate the accident;  and (4) that the lighting and condition of the stairway during the view were materially different than at the time of the accident.  None of these allegations succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of a court reporter, though ill-advised, bears no obvious relationship to the outcome of this case, and, hence, it cannot, without more, be deemed prejudicial.  See Northwestern Nat'l Casualty Co. v. Global Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 533 F.2d 320, 323 (6th Cir.1976).  Similarly, there is no indication that the judge's alleged interaction with the jury--which, if it occurred at all, evidently consisted of a juror asking the judge if the bar lights could be activatedprejudiced appellant's substantial rights.  See, e.g., United States v. Taylor, 562 F.2d 1345, 1366 (2d Cir.)  (finding private communication between judge and juror harmless), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 2958, 53 L.Ed.2d 1083 (1977), and cert. denied, 434 U.S. 853, 98 S.Ct. 170, 54 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977).  Next, while we do not condone freewheeling experimentation on the jurors' part during a view, what occurred here was apparently limited to a juror scuffing the stairway with the sole of a shoe.  Appellant has not suggested how such conduct might have been harmful in fact, cf. People v. Hardy, 2 Cal.4th 86, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850, 825 P.2d 781, 835 (en banc) (finding \"no reasonable probability ... [of] actual prejudice\" where the trial court permitted a juror, during a view of a crime scene, to examine a door and to have it opened and closed), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 498, 121 L.Ed.2d 435 (1992), and cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 987, 122 L.Ed.2d 139 (1993), especially since the experiment seemingly had relevance only to the negligent maintenance claim--a claim that in the long run never reached the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Finally, appellant's conclusory allegation that the conditions surrounding the staircase during the view were \"dramatically different than those conditions at the time of the accident\" falls far short of establishing that any prejudicial error actually resulted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Northwestern Nat'l Casualty, 533 F.2d at 323 (upholding jury view even though \"the appearance of the site had changed since the relevant events\");  Martin v. Gulf States Utils.  Co., 344 F.2d 34, 37 (5th Cir.1965) (upholding jury view even though the scene's \"physical appearance had been substantially altered since the accident\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When all is said and done, we must affirm the denial of appellant's motion for a mistrial despite the absence of precautions accompanying the view's implementation.  Because appellant neither preserved her rights nor demonstrated actual prejudice, we are unable to say that the lower court, in refusing a mistrial, abused its discretion.  See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir.1993) (\"Granting or denying a motion for a mistrial is a matter committed to the trial court's discretion.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994);  Real v. Hogan, 828 F.2d 58, 61 (1st Cir.1987) (\"A motion for mistrial is directed primarily to the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling thereon will not be disturbed unless that discretion has been misused.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE DIRECTED VERDICT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law on her claim that the defendants negligently tolerated a hazardous condition on the hotel's premises.  Appellant concedes that a hotel is not an insurer of a guest's safety.  Nonetheless, she argues that there was enough evidence for a rational jury to find that the defendants knew or should have known of the foreign substance's presence on the stairs in ample time to remove it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant adduced no proof that the defendants had actual notice of the danger.  Her claim compresses, therefore, into a claim premised on constructive notice.  Her basic theory is that the jury plausibly could have inferred that a liquid was on the stairs for a period of time sufficient for the hotel's staff to have discovered and removed it.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law \"[i]f during a trial by a jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue,\" and the party's entire claim \"cannot under the controlling law be maintained ... without a favorable finding on that issue.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1).  In executing this standard, the trial court \"must scrutinize the proof and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant ... [and] must refrain from differential factfinding;  that is to say, the court must 'not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.' \"  Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 76-77 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987)).  Because \"the court of appeals is constrained in precisely the same fashion as the district court ..., and because the key question revolves around the legal sufficiency of the evidence, appellate review is plenary.\"  Id. at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, appellant offered some evidence from which a factfinder could have concluded that there was a foreign substance on the staircase.  Yet, she failed to produce any evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to determine that the hotel had constructive notice of the hazardous condition.  The dampness on her clothing may tend to prove the presence of a foreign substance on the stairs, but it does not in any way demonstrate how long the substance may have been there.  The personality profile of the hotel is a two-edged sword;  although appellant says that the size of the complex, the number of waitpersons, and the scarcity of janitorial help show both an enhanced likelihood of spillage and a diminished ability to discover incipient dangers, the same facts also show that the substance could have emanated from various sources at a variety of times.  In short, there is nothing at all from which a rational juror could do more than guess about how long the substance may have been in situ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This deficiency causes appellant's claim to stumble on our decision in Mas v. United States, 984 F.2d 527 (1st Cir.1993).  In Mas, as here, the law of Puerto Rico governed the issue.  There, we affirmed the lower court's dismissal of a personal injury action--in that case, the plaintiff claimed to have slipped on a small puddle of spilt milk on the floor of an army commissary--on the ground that the proof failed adequately to demonstrate that the defendant knew or should have known of the supposedly dangerous condition.  In so doing, we held that the very same statute upon which appellant's suit depends, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5141, quoted supra note 2, \"requires, as an element, an affirmative showing by the plaintiff that the defendant ... ha[d] either actual or constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition.\"  Mas, 984 F.2d at 530.   So it is here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  In this instance, even if the jury believed that a liquid saturated the stairway, there is no evidence from which it sensibly could infer how long the liquid had been on the stairs.  Because that is so, the jury could not have drawn a reasonable inference that defendants knew or should have known of the liquid's existence in sufficient time to have removed it before Clemente appeared on the scene.  It follows inexorably, as night follows day, that the district court appropriately granted judgment as a matter of law in the defendants' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For simplicity's sake, we do not distinguish among the entities that have been sued, but refer to them collectively as \"the defendants.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>A person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done....</p>\n        <p>P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5141 (1991).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> While this position represents the majority view, see 2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on Evidence Sec. 216, at 27 (4th ed. 1992) (noting that \"[a] large number of jurisdictions, probably a majority, holds that a view is not itself evidence\"), some courts have ruled to the contrary, particularly in connection with bench trials.  See, e.g., Lillie v. United States, 953 F.2d 1188, 1190 (10th Cir.1992) (stating that a view in a bench trial is evidence, though acknowledging cases to the contrary).  But see Processteel, Inc. v. Mosley Mach. Co., 421 F.2d 1074, 1076 (6th Cir.1970) (disapproving of \"a fact finder using visual inspection ... in the place of testimony to resolve factual issues\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Another problem with this claim of error is that the trial court has discretion to permit some degree of experimentation by jurors in the course of a view.  See Wendorf, supra, at 394 (\"In the exercise of sound judicial discretion, it may on occasion ... be useful to permit the conduct of experiments at the view.\").  On this sketchy record, there is no principled way that we can find an abuse of discretion in the court's implied consent to the anonymous juror's modest experiment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In any event, the time to complain about predictable variations resulting from changed circumstances, such as differences in the time of day, is at the outset.  Here, plaintiff did not make a peep when the judge scheduled the view to take place in the early evening hours</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Appellant's reliance on Colon Miranda v. Plaza Las Americas, 94 J.T.S. 84 (P.R.1994), takes her one step forward and two steps back.  Colon Miranda represents only a judgment and not an opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and, therefore, carries no precedential value.  See Rivera Maldonado v. Commonwealth of P.R., 119 D.P.R. 74 (1987) (Official English Translation:  No. R-85-117, slip op. at 4-5) (\"It shall not be appropriate to cite, as an authority or as a precedent, judgments that are not Court opinions.  A judgment without a Court opinion ... has no precedential value;  it only has the intrinsic persuasive value of its rationale.\")</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

After carefully considering her plaints, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 1992, appellant, a citizen of New York, traveled to Puerto Rico.  She registered as a guest at La Concha.  At 10:30 that evening, while exiting the piano bar, appellant slipped on the second step of a small, carpeted stairway.  Having neglected to use the handrail, she plummeted to the floor, posterior first, sustaining a fractured right ankle and other injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), appellant brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  In her complaint, she posited two theories of tortious conduct under Puerto Rico's general negligence statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> alleging that the defendants not only failed to keep the stairs free of foreign substances but also inadequately illuminated them.  The first allegation stemmed from appellant's claim that the stairs, at the time of her tumble, were suffused with some sort of liquid (an inference that she drew from the dampness in her pants and on her person following her spill).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial commenced on April 20, 1994.  At the close of the plaintiff's case, the judge remarked that visiting the accident scene might assist the jury.  When neither party objected, the judge ordered a view to take place at approximately 7:00 p.m.  In implementing the order, the judge provided very little structure.  He neglected to give the jurors any detailed instructions or to enlist the court reporter's participation.  Once the entourage reached La Concha, the jurors conversed freely among themselves and at least one juror touched foot to stair.  It is alleged--though disputed--that the jurors also spoke with the judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these informalities, appellant did not object at any point before or during the view, nor did she solicit any jury instructions concerning the view, nor did she request the presence of a reporter.  It was not until the next day that appellant for the first time objected to the view and, concomitantly, moved for a mistrial.  The judge overruled her objection and denied her motion.  Even then, appellant neither asked to interview the jurors nor requested any sort of curative instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of all the evidence, the district court defenestrated the claim of careless maintenance, granting the defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), and sent the case to the jury only on the parallel claim of poor illumination.  Appellant did not ask the court to comment on the evidentiary status of the view in its instructions, and the court did not do so.

THE VIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's principal assignment of error features the district court's denial of her motion for a mistrial.  The asseveration rests on the premise that defects associated with the view required a new beginning.  Thus, the question presented reduces, in the first instance, to the status of the view itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to secure our footing, we begin with common ground:  a federal court, exercising its inherent powers, may allow a jury in either a civil or a criminal case to view places or objects outside the courtroom.

See United States v. Pettiford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582530\"><a href=\"/opinion/582530/united-states-v-brian-a-pettiford/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v.

Wendorf, Some Views on Jury Views, 15 Baylor L.Rev. 379, 390-92 (1963) (cataloguing several considerations that may enter into a judge's discretionary decision to grant or deny a view).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though discretionary at the outset, a view, once authorized, should embody certain fundamental safeguards.  Collectively, these safeguards are aimed at achieving fairness and maximizing the trial's truth-seeking function.  We limn a five-step protocol that a court customarily should follow before and during a view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, counsel should be alerted to a proposed view at the earliest practicable time and given an opportunity to be heard concerning it.  See John R. Allison, Combinations of Decision-Making Functions, Ex Parte Communications, and Related Biasing Influences:  A Process-Value Analysis, 1993 Utah L.Rev. 1135, 1218-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, because the rule in this circuit is that a view does not itself constitute or generate evidence, the jury should be instructed prior to embarking on the view that the view itself is not evidence as such, but, rather, is simply a mechanism to facilitate contextualization of the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See 1 Edward J. Devitt et al., Federal Jury Practice and Instructions Sec. 5.14, at 133 (1992) (\"Ordinarily, when the jury takes a view the court explicitly instructs them that they are not to consider what they see as evidence in a case, but that the view is merely to enable them to apply the evidence in the case.\").  Upon timely request of either party, the court should include a similar statement in its final charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, counsel should be given the opportunity to attend the view, although the judge may, in his discretion, place limits on their interaction with the subject of the view and with the jurors.  See 2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on Evidence Sec. 216, at 26 (4th ed. 1992);  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Allison,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">1218-19</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, because the judge's oversight is as necessary at a view as in the course of the trial proper, the judge ordinarily should attend the view.  See 2 Strong et <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">al.,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">27</span></span>;  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Allison,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">1219</span></span>;  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wendorf,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">393</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, the court should employ some method of fully and accurately recording that which transpires at the view, usually by enlisting the attendance of a court reporter.  See Lillie v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575893\"><a href=\"/opinion/575893/nellie-lou-lillie-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></a></span>, 1191 (10th Cir.1992) (noting that where \"there is no record of the view, the litigants may effectively be denied any means of challenge on appeal\");  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Allison,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">1219</span></span>-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a caveat:  the list we have compiled is not intended to be exhaustive or inflexible.  There may very well be other precautions, not recounted above, that deserve consideration in the particular circumstances of a given case.  Similarly, while the enumerated procedures ordinarily should be employed, we are reluctant to impose a rigid format upon the trial bench.  Thus, if circumstances warrant, the court may innovate (even if innovation necessitates departing from the list).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last but not least, we emphasize that the onus for implementing these safeguards does not rest exclusively upon the trial judge.  When a judge orders a view but strays from the prophylaxis that should accompany it, an offended party must bring the omissions to the judge's attention in a timeous fashion, and, if necessary, lodge a formal objection.  A party's failure to take appropriate action will, in most cases, foreclose an appeal predicated on the omission of standard safeguards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at bar vividly illustrates this last point.  Although the court ignored some of the standard safeguards, appellant did not preserve her right to contest the propriety of what transpired.  Before the fact, appellant acquiesced in the court's suggestion that the jury observe the accident scene.  She failed either to request that a court stenographer be present or to object when the judge did not spontaneously arrange for the reporter's attendance.  And, she compounded these omissions by not asking that the jurors be given explicative instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make a bad situation worse, appellant's lassitude continued after the view had been completed.  Though she made speculative allegations of misconduct when she moved for a mistrial, she neither sought an opportunity to conduct a voir dire in order to transform conjecture into hard fact nor requested a curative instruction to alleviate potential harm.  Given this history of inattention, the record simply will not support appellant's assignment of error.  See, e.g., Reilly v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515719\"><a href=\"/opinion/515719/donna-reilly-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 160 (1st Cir.1988) (stating rule that \"when a trial judge announces a proposed course of action which litigants believe to be erroneous, the parties detrimentally affected must act expeditiously to call the error to the judge's attention or to cure the defect\");  Merchant v. Ruhle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439210\"><a href=\"/opinion/439210/james-p-merchant-v-philip-henry-ruhle/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.1984) (warning against attempts to convert \"agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error [into] a weapon of appellate advocacy\");  see generally United States v. Camporeale, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"327166\"><a href=\"/opinion/327166/united-states-v-michael-camporeale/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 188 (2d Cir.1975) (observing that \"normally the failure of counsel to register a timely objection to the submission of improper evidence to the jury will be deemed a waiver\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's eleventh-hour motion to abort the proceedings did not miraculously cure the sapping effects of this string of waivers.  Parties cannot casually forgo contemporaneous objections and then make up lost ground by means of an afterthought motion for mistrial.  Such a motion is not a ready substitute for a timely objection.  See, e.g., United States v. Tropeano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"310159\"><a href=\"/opinion/310159/united-states-v-rudolph-a-tropeano/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 587-88 (1st Cir.)

Appellant describes four potential sources of prejudice:  (1) that the judge did not utilize the services of a court reporter or some other means of recordation;  (2) that the judge may have conversed with the jury during the view;  (3) that one or more jurors may have \"experimented\" with the stairway in an attempt to recreate the accident;  and (4) that the lighting and condition of the stairway during the view were materially different than at the time of the accident.  None of these allegations succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of a court reporter, though ill-advised, bears no obvious relationship to the outcome of this case, and, hence, it cannot, without more, be deemed prejudicial.  See Northwestern Nat'l Casualty Co. v. Global Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334689\"><a href=\"/opinion/334689/northwestern-national-casualty-co-v-global-moving-storage-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span>, 323 (6th Cir.1976).  Similarly, there is no indication that the judge's alleged interaction with the jury--which, if it occurred at all, evidently consisted of a juror asking the judge if the bar lights could be activatedprejudiced appellant's substantial rights.  See, e.g., United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349452\"><a href=\"/opinion/349452/united-states-v-al-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1345</span></a></span>, 1366 (2d Cir.)

Next, while we do not condone freewheeling experimentation on the jurors' part during a view, what occurred here was apparently limited to a juror scuffing the stairway with the sole of a shoe.  Appellant has not suggested how such conduct might have been harmful in fact, cf. People v.

THE DIRECTED VERDICT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law on her claim that the defendants negligently tolerated a hazardous condition on the hotel's premises.  Appellant concedes that a hotel is not an insurer of a guest's safety.  Nonetheless, she argues that there was enough evidence for a rational jury to find that the defendants knew or should have known of the foreign substance's presence on the stairs in ample time to remove it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant adduced no proof that the defendants had actual notice of the danger.  Her claim compresses, therefore, into a claim premised on constructive notice.  Her basic theory is that the jury plausibly could have inferred that a liquid was on the stairs for a period of time sufficient for the hotel's staff to have discovered and removed it.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law \"[i]f during a trial by a jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue,\" and the party's entire claim \"cannot under the controlling law be maintained ... without a favorable finding on that issue.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1).  In executing this standard, the trial court \"must scrutinize the proof and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant ... [and] must refrain from differential factfinding;  that is to say, the court must 'not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.' \"  Rolon-Alvarado v.

Yet, she failed to produce any evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to determine that the hotel had constructive notice of the hazardous condition.  The dampness on her clothing may tend to prove the presence of a foreign substance on the stairs, but it does not in any way demonstrate how long the substance may have been there.  The personality profile of the hotel is a two-edged sword;  although appellant says that the size of the complex, the number of waitpersons, and the scarcity of janitorial help show both an enhanced likelihood of spillage and a diminished ability to discover incipient dangers, the same facts also show that the substance could have emanated from various sources at a variety of times.  In short, there is nothing at all from which a rational juror could do more than guess about how long the substance may have been in situ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This deficiency causes appellant's claim to stumble on our decision in Mas v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599124\"><a href=\"/opinion/599124/isabelita-mas-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1993).  In Mas, as here, the law of Puerto Rico governed the issue.  There, we affirmed the lower court's dismissal of a personal injury action--in that case, the plaintiff claimed to have slipped on a small puddle of spilt milk on the floor of an army commissary--on the ground that the proof failed adequately to demonstrate that the defendant knew or should have known of the supposedly dangerous condition.  In so doing, we held that the very same statute upon which appellant's suit depends, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5141, quoted supra note 2, \"requires, as an element, an affirmative showing by the plaintiff that the defendant ... ha[d] either actual or constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599124\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mas,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/599124/isabelita-mas-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>.

In this instance, even if the jury believed that a liquid saturated the stairway, there is no evidence from which it sensibly could infer how long the liquid had been on the stairs.  Because that is so, the jury could not have drawn a reasonable inference that defendants knew or should have known of the liquid's existence in sufficient time to have removed it before Clemente appeared on the scene.  It follows inexorably, as night follows day, that the district court appropriately granted judgment as a matter of law in the defendants' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For simplicity's sake, we do not distinguish among the entities that have been sued, but refer to them collectively as \"the defendants.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>A person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done....</p>\n        <p>P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5141 (1991).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> While this position represents the majority view, see 2 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on Evidence Sec. 216, at 27 (4th ed. 1992) (noting that \"[a] large number of jurisdictions, probably a majority, holds that a view is not itself evidence\"), some courts have ruled to the contrary, particularly in connection with bench trials.  See, e.g., Lillie v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575893\"><a href=\"/opinion/575893/nellie-lou-lillie-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></a></span>, 1190 (10th Cir.1992) (stating that a view in a bench trial is evidence, though acknowledging cases to the contrary).  But see Processteel, Inc. v. Mosley Mach.

See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wendorf,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">394</span> </span>(\"In the exercise of sound judicial discretion, it may on occasion ... be useful to permit the conduct of experiments at the view.\").  On this sketchy record, there is no principled way that we can find an abuse of discretion in the court's implied consent to the anonymous juror's modest experiment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In any event, the time to complain about predictable variations resulting from changed circumstances, such as differences in the time of day, is at the outset.

Plaza Las Americas, 94 J.T.S. 84 (P.R.1994), takes her one step forward and two steps back.  Colon Miranda represents only a judgment and not an opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and, therefore, carries no precedential value.  See Rivera Maldonado v. Commonwealth of P.R., 119 D.P.R. 74 (1987) (Official English Translation:  No. R-85-117, slip op. at 4-5) (\"It shall not be appropriate to cite, as an authority or as a precedent, judgments that are not Court opinions.  A judgment without a Court opinion ... has no precedential value;  it only has the intrinsic persuasive value of its rationale.\")</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
