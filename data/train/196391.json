Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                  \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Cyr and Boudin,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nDerrick Anderson on brief pro se.\r                            \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   Derrick  Anderson appeals pro  se the\r                                                                     \r\n\ndismissal  of his  in forma  pauperis complaint  as frivolous\r                                                 \r\n\nunder 28  U.S.C.    1915(d).   We affirm  in part,  vacate in\r\n\npart, and remand other claims for further proceedings.\r\n\n          The  complaint alleges  that on  October  28, 1991,\r\n\nAnderson was  arrested  by  two  security guards  as  he  was\r\n\nleaving Tower  Records.   The guards allegedly  searched him,\r\n\nseized compact discs for which he had a receipt, and detained\r\n\nhim until Boston Police  officers arrived and transported him\r\n\nto a \"lock-up.\"  Anderson was later tried for shoplifting and\r\n\nacquitted.   He seeks declaratory relief  and damages against\r\n\nTower  Records, the  two guards,  their supervisor,  and \"any\r\n\nother  respondeat  superiors\"  for violations  of  his  civil\r\n\nrights  under 42  U.S.C.      1983,  1985,  as  well  as  for\r\n\nviolations of 18 U.S.C.    241, 242.\r\n\n          We affirm  the dismissal of Anderson's  42 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1985  and  18 U.S.C.      241,  242 claims,  as  well  as the\r\n\ndismissal of his  claim for  damages under 42  U.S.C.    1983\r\n\nbased on  defendants' testimony at Anderson's criminal trial.\r\n\nAnderson makes no reference to these claims in his brief, and\r\n\nwe  affirm their dismissal on  the ground that  he has waived\r\n\nthem.  See,  e.g., Frazier v. Bailey, 957 F.2d  920, 932 n.14\r                                                \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).  We  add that, in any event, we  think these\r\n\nclaims were properly dismissed for the reasons stated  by the\r\n\ndistrict court.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Anderson's remaining claims allege  unlawful search\r\n\nand seizure, false arrest, and malicious prosecution under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.    1983.  The district court dismissed these claims on\r\n\nthe ground  that Anderson failed to state  facts showing that\r\n\nthe  defendants  acted under  color of  law.   See  Alexis v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMcDonald's  Restaurants of Mass., Inc., 1995  WL 584187 at *7\r                                                  \r\n\n(1st   Cir.  Oct.   10,   1995)   (discussing  state   action\r\n\nrequirement).   We think  that the dismissal  of these claims\r\n\nunder     1915(d),  without  an  opportunity  to  amend,  was\r\n\nprecipitous.1   Since  there  are circumstances  under  which\r\n\nsecurity guards  and their  employers have been  found to  be\r\n\nstate actors, see,  e.g., Murray v. Wal-Mart,  Inc., 874 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n555,  558-59  (8th Cir.  1989);  Rojas  v. Alexander's  Dep't\r                                                                         \r\n\nStore, Inc., 654 F. Supp. 856, 858 (E.D.N.Y. 1987), we cannot\r                       \r\n\nsay that Anderson would  be unable to cure any  deficiency in\r\n\nhis  allegations by  more specific  pleading, see  Neitzke v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989) (complaint  which fails to\r                    \r\n\nstate  a cause  of  action is  not automatically  frivolous).\r\n\nAccordingly, we vacate the dismissal of these claims.\r\n\n          We stress that  at this stage Anderson has  not met\r\n\nthe \"color-of-law\" requirement  through adequate  allegations\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We note  that although the  district court issued  a show\r\ncause  order allowing  Anderson twenty  days within  which to\r\nexplain why his complaint should not be dismissed, the record\r\ndiscloses that this order  was returned, undelivered, because\r\nAnderson,  an inmate, had been transferred from one prison to\r\nanother.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nof fact (let alone proof), and it may well be  that he cannot\r\n\ndo so.  But this is an area of law in which the precedents do\r\n\nnot provide a simple bright-line test, and there are at least\r\n\nhints that Anderson might  have more to allege on  the color-\r\n\nof-law  issue  if  afforded   an  opportunity.    Because  of\r\n\ncircumstances outside the control  of both the district court\r\n\nand  Anderson,  that  opportunity has  not  been  effectively\r\n\nafforded, and we think that it should  be, without intimating\r\n\nany view about the ultimate result in this case.\r\n\n     Affirmed, in  part; vacated,  in part; and  remanded for\r                                                                         \r\n\nfurther proceedings.\r                                \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
