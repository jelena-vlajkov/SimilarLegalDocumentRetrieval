Boudreau on brief for appellant\n                     \n   Donald  K.  Stern,  United  States  Attorney,  and  Mark  W.\n                                                               \nPearlstein,  Assistant  United  States  Attorney,  on  brief  for\n        \nappellee.\n\n                                        \n                        July 15, 1994\n                                        \n\n          Per  Curiam.      Defendant  appeals  the  sentence\n                     \n\nimposed upon him following revocation of a term of supervised\n\nrelease.       Defendant  was  initially  sentenced   to  six\n\nmonths  imprisonment  and  thirty-six  months  on  supervised\n\nrelease following his  guilty plea  to one count  of using  a\n\nfalse social  security number, in  violation of  42 U.S.C.   \n\n408(a)(7)(B). \n\n          Defendant  conceded that shortly  after his release\n\nfrom  prison,  he  violated  two special  conditions  of  his\n\nsupervised release.  The  district court granted the petition\n\nfor  revocation and resentenced defendant to a term of eleven\n\nmonths  imprisonment,  followed   by  twenty-four  months  on\n\nsupervised release. \n\n          Defendant's  only argument  on appeal  is that  the\n\nsupervised  release  revocation   provision  (\"SRR\")  of  the\n\nSentencing  Reform Act of 1984,  18 U.S.C.   3583(e)(3), does\n\nnot  authorize  the  district  court  to  impose  a  term  of\n\nsupervised release in  conjunction with an  additional prison\n\nterm.    This court  recently  considered,  and rejected,  an\n\nidentical  contention in United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).  We held in O'Neil,  \n                                   \n\n     [T]he SRR provision . . . permits a district court,\n     upon revocation of a term of supervised release, to\n     impose  a  prison sentence  combining incarceration\n     with a further term  of supervised release, so long\n     as (1)  the incarcerative portion  of the  sentence\n     does not exceed the time limit specified in the SRR\n     provision  itself, and  (2) the combined  length of\n     the new prison  sentence cum supervision term  does\n                                 \n\n                             -2-\n\n     not  exceed the  duration of  the original  term of\n     supervised release.\n\nO'Neil, 11 F.3d at 302.\n      \n\n          As defendant acknowledges, the sentence  imposed by\n\nthe district court here  comports with O'Neil.  The  combined\n                                             \n\nlimit of the three  years matches the length of  the original\n\nterm  of supervision,  and the  included eleven  month prison\n\nterm  is well below the time limit of two years incarceration\n\nfor the underlying Class D felony.\n\n          Defendant urges, however, that the  Supreme Court's\n\nopinion  in United  States  v. Granderson,  114  S. Ct.  1259\n                                         \n\n(1994), \"has substantially undermined the reasoning and basis\n\nof O'Neil.\"  We disagree.  Granderson  involved the statutory\n                                     \n\ninterpretation  of  a  different  section  of  the Sentencing\n\nReform Act, the probation revocation section.   See 18 U.S.C.\n                                                   \n\n  3565.  The interpretive issue in Granderson was the meaning\n                                             \n\nof the  benchmark term  \"original sentence,\"  as used  in the\n\nprovision  requiring imposition  of a  sentence of  \"not less\n\nthan one-third of the  original sentence,\" when a probationer\n\nis  found  in  possession of  illegal  drugs.    18 U.S.C.   \n\n3565(a).   Granderson did not  address the O'Neil question --\n                                                 \n\nthe power of a sentencing court to  impose combined sentences\n\n-- but focused  on the  correct measure  of the  length of  a\n\nsentence to be imposed.       Granderson   and   O'Neil  thus\n                                                       \n\ninvolved  different  substantive  and   interpretive  issues,\n\ndiscrete  texts,  statutory structures,  and histories.   See\n                                                             \n\n                             -3-\n\nGranderson,  114  S.  Ct.  at 1266  (stating  that  different\n          \n\nfunctions  of supervised release  and probation weigh heavily\n\nagainst an in  pari materia reading of  the separately worded\n                           \n\nrevocation provisions); O'Neil,  11 F.3d at  298-300 (tracing\n                              \n\ndifferences in the design of the current sentencing regime to\n\nhistorical differences  between probation  and parole).   The\n\ndifferences which defendant observes  in the two opinions are\n\na function of the  lack of common issues, not  of differences\n\nin analytic method or statutory construction.\n\n          As  the  dispositive  issue  on  appeal  has   been\n\nrecently  and  authoritatively decided  by  a  panel of  this\n\ncourt, and  no other  substantial question is  presented, the\n\ndecision below is summarily affirmed.
