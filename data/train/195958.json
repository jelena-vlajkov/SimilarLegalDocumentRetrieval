In  1992,   a  nine-count   superseding\r                            \n\nindictment charged petitioner Domenic Lombardi  with engaging\n\nin a fraudulent scheme  to collect insurance proceeds through\n\narson.   Petitioner  eventually pled guilty  to six  of these\n\noffenses:  three  counts of  mail  fraud  (and conspiracy  to\n\ncommit same), 18 U.S.C.    1341; two counts of engaging  in a\n\nmonetary  transaction  with criminally  derived  property, 18\n\nU.S.C.   1957; and one  count of using a fire to  commit mail\n\nfraud, 18 U.S.C.   844(h).  At sentencing, the district court\n\nimposed  a 63-month prison term for the first five counts, to\n\nwhich  was added  a mandatory, consecutive  60-month sentence\n\nfor  the      844(h)  offense.     On  appeal,   we  affirmed\n\npetitioner's  sentence in  all  respects.   United States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nLombardi, 5 F.3d 568 (1st Cir. 1993).1\r                    \n\n     By way of the  instant petition under 28 U.S.C.    2255,\n\npetitioner  presents  two  new  challenges  to his  sentence.\n\nSpecifically, he  contends that the  court (1)  miscalculated\n\nhis criminal history category and (2) erred in sentencing him\n\non  the  basis of  relevant conduct.    He also  advances the\n\nderivative  claim  that  his trial  and  appellate  attorneys\n\nrendered ineffective  assistance by  failing to  pursue these\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Petitioner   there  advanced   four  challenges   to  his\nsentence,  arguing that  the  court  had  erred  (1)  in  its\ngrouping of offenses, (2) by  declining to depart downward on\nthe  basis of his  age and health, (3)  by awarding only two,\nrather than  three, points for acceptance  of responsibility,\nand  (4) by ordering payment  of a fine  and restitution.  We\nfound each of these contentions to be without merit.  \n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\narguments.  We  need not  decide to what  extent such  claims\n\nmight be forfeited, see, e.g., Lopez-Torres v. United States,\r                                                                        \n\n876 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 493 U.S. 979 (1989),\r                                                   \n\nor  might otherwise not be cognizable in a   2255 proceeding,\n\nsee,  e.g., Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 771-74 (1st\r                                               \n\nCir. 1994), inasmuch as we agree with the district court that\n\npetitioner's contentions are manifestly without merit.  \n\n     1.  Criminal History Category \r                                              \n\n     Petitioner's central challenge to the calculation of his\n\ncriminal history category (CHC)  is based on a  misreading of\n\nthe  sentencing  guidelines.   In  determining  the CHC,  the\n\ndistrict court, inter alia,  awarded one point under U.S.S.G.\r                                      \n\n   4A1.1(c) for  each  of  the  following three  state  court\n\nconvictions: \n\n          Attempting   to   obtain  money   under  false\n     pretenses.   Offense committed on February 8, 1974.\n     Petitioner sentenced on  April 27, 1979,  following\n     nolo plea,  to two years probation.   (Violation of\n     probation  on  June  18,  1979;  continued  on same\n     probation.)\n\n          Violation   of   banking  law   (two  counts).\n     Offenses committed  on June  28, 1976.   Petitioner\n     sentenced  on April 24,  1979, following nolo plea,\n     to two  years probation on each  count, concurrent.\n     (Violation of probation on June 18, 1979; sentenced\n     to thirty days imprisonment.) \n\n          Failure  to  return   rental  car.     Offense\n     committed  on   February  23,  1977.     Petitioner\n     sentenced on December 4, 1979, following nolo plea,\n     to $100 fine.\n\nPetitioner contends that each  of these offenses occurred too\n\nlong ago to be  considered.  Yet the guidelines  provide that\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n\"[a]ny other prior sentence that was imposed within ten years\n\nof  the defendant's  commencement of  the instant  offense is\n\ncounted.\"    U.S.S.G.    4A1.2(e)(2).    Petitioner does  not\n\ndispute  that the conspiracy to which he pled guilty began in\n\n1988,  or that  the  substantive offenses  to  which he  pled\n\nguilty began in January 1989 at the latest.  Accordingly, the\n\nsentences for each of the above three convictions (which were\n\nimposed in April  and December  1979, respectively)  occurred\n\nwithin the applicable ten-year period.  Petitioner's argument\n\nto  the contrary mistakenly relies  on the date  when each of\n\nthose  offenses was committed,  rather than on  the date when\n\nsentencing took place. \n\n     Petitioner also asserts that  the conviction for failure\n\nto return a rental car (with the resulting $100 fine) was too\n\ntrivial   to  be  considered.    He   points  to  U.S.S.G.   \n\n4A1.2(c)(1), which provides that some fifteen  minor offenses\n\nthat are there listed, \"and offenses similar to them,\" are to\n\nbe  counted only if, inter alia, the sentence therefor was at\r                                           \n\nleast one year of probation or  thirty days of imprisonment.2\n\nYet  his  suggestion  that   the  rental  car  conviction  is\n\n\"similar\"  to the  offenses listed  in    4A1.2(c)(1) appears\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  The offenses there specified  include such infractions as\ncontempt  of court, gambling,  resisting arrest, prostitution\nand trespassing.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ndubious.3   This argument, in any event, was not raised below\n\nand so has been waived.   And any error in this  regard would\n\nplainly have  been harmless.   Unlike more  substantial prior\n\nsentences for which either  two or three points are  added to\n\nthe CHC, see U.S.S.G.    4A1.1(a)-(b), the guidelines provide\r                        \n\nthat one point shall  be added for other prior  sentences \"up\n\nto a  total  of 4  points  for this  item,\"  id.    4A1.1(c).\r                                                            \n\nIncluded in  petitioner's criminal history are  at least five\n\nother  convictions that, according  to the presentence report\n\n(PSR), were eligible for a one-point addition but were not so\n\ncounted because of the four-point maximum.  Accordingly, were\n\nthe rental  car conviction  to be  disregarded, one  of these\n\nother convictions  would be included in  its stead--such that\n\npetitioner's CHC would not change.\n\n     Both of petitioner's  challenges to the CHC  calculation\n\nthus prove meritless.  It follows that the failure of counsel\n\nto  pursue   these  matters  cannot   be  deemed  ineffective\n\nassistance. \n\n     2.  Relevant Conduct\r                                     \n\n     The  district court increased  petitioner's base offense\n\nlevel by eight points under  U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(1), based on\n\na determination that the aggregate  losses exceeded $200,000.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  We note, for example,  that (according to the presentence\nreport)  petitioner was originally  convicted of such offense\nin  state   district  court  and  sentenced   to  sixty  days\nimprisonment.   Only upon trial de novo in superior court did\nhe receive the reduced sanction of a $100 fine.\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nIn  so  finding, the  court not  only  took into  account the\n\nlosses resulting  from the  offenses of conviction,  but also\n\nconsidered  under  the  \"relevant  conduct\"  provision  of   \n\n1B1.3(a)   those  losses  stemming  from  some  eleven  other\n\ninstances  of   mail  fraud  in  which  petitioner  allegedly\n\nparticipated.  In an abstruse series of arguments, petitioner\n\nclaims that the court erred in this regard.  We disagree.\n\n     First,  to the  extent petitioner  is alleging  that the\n\nrelevant  conduct provision is  unconstitutional per  se, his\n\nargument can be summarily rejected.  See, e.g., United States\r                                                                         \n\nv. Bennett,  37  F.3d 687,  692-94  (1st Cir.  1994);  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Carrozza, 4  F.3d 70, 80-81 (1st Cir.  1993), cert.\r                                                                         \n\ndenied,  114 S. Ct. 1644 (1994); United States v. Wright, 873\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 437, 441 (1st Cir.  1989).  Second, to the extent  he is\n\ncontending that the  evidence was  insufficient to  establish\n\nhis involvement in the other mail frauds, it suffices to note\n\nthat  the district court  was warranted in  accepting as true\n\nall facts appearing in the PSR to which no objection had been\n\nvoiced.   See, e.g., United States v.  Fox, 889 F.2d 357, 359\r                                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1989).  Third, to the extent he is arguing that the\n\nevidence was  insufficient to  establish that the  other mail\n\nfrauds were \"part  of the  same course of  conduct or  common\n\nscheme or  plan\" as  the offenses  of conviction,  U.S.S.G.  \n\n1B1.3(a)(2),  we  disagree.     Each  of  the  other  frauds,\n\ninvolving efforts  to defraud  insurance companies by  use of\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nthe mails between  1988 and  1990, readily  falls within  the\n\nscope of those terms.  See id.   1B1.3, comment. (n.9).\r                                          \n\n     Fourth,  to  the  extent  petitioner  is  complaining of\n\ncounsel's  failure to  object  to the  consideration of  such\n\nrelevant  conduct, we find no  error.  According  to the PSR,\n\npetitioner had acknowledged his  involvement in most of those\n\nother  mail  frauds  to  a confidential  informant,  who  had\n\ncaptured  such admissions  on  tape.   In  the face  of  such\n\nevidence, counsel's  decision  not to  contest these  matters\n\n(and  thereby risk,  inter alia,  forgoing the  reduction for\r                                           \n\nacceptance of  responsibility) was well \"within  the range of\n\ncompetence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\"  Hill v.\r                                                                      \n\nLockhart,  474   U.S.  52,  56  (1985)   (internal  quotation\r                    \n\nomitted).  \n\n     Finally, to  the extent  petitioner is objecting  to the\n\nconsideration of some $12,441 in losses resulting from a mail\n\nfraud involved in a related prosecution, the PSR specifically\n\nprovided  (in response  to defense counsel's  objection) that\n\nsuch losses would be  excluded from that other case  to avoid\n\ndouble-counting.   We thus perceive no error.  And again, any\n\nerror in this regard would plainly have been harmless.  Given\n\nthe   grouping   rule  that   was   applied   at  sentencing,\n\npetitioner's offense level would have remained unchanged even\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nif the losses  had not  exceeded $200,000.4   See U.S.S.G.   \r                                                             \n\n3D1.4(a);  see also  Lombardi, 5  F.3d at  570.   His overall\r                                         \n\nrestitution   obligation   likewise   would   have   remained\n\nunaltered.  \n\n     Affirmed. \r                          \n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  While the  government has stated (and  petitioner has not\nseriously disputed) that the  losses would have exceeded that\nlevel even  without including the $12,441  figure, the partly\nambiguous record  before us  does not permit  confirmation of\nthis fact.\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n",

Petitioner eventually pled guilty to six of these offenses:  three counts of mail fraud (and conspiracy to commit same), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341;  two counts of engaging in a monetary transaction with criminally derived property, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1957;  and one count of using a fire to commit mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(h).  At sentencing, the district court imposed a 63-month prison term for the first five counts, to which was added a mandatory, consecutive 60-month sentence for the Sec. 844(h) offense.  On appeal, we affirmed petitioner's sentence in all respects.  United States v.

He also advances the derivative claim that his trial and appellate attorneys rendered ineffective assistance by failing to pursue these arguments.  We need not decide to what extent such claims might be forfeited, see, e.g., Lopez-Torres v.

Yet the guidelines provide that \"[a]ny other prior sentence that was imposed within ten years of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense is counted.\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(e)(2).  Petitioner does not dispute that the conspiracy to which he pled guilty began in 1988, or that the substantive offenses to which he pled guilty began in January 1989 at the latest.  Accordingly, the sentences for each of the above three convictions (which were imposed in April and December 1979, respectively) occurred within the applicable ten-year period.  Petitioner's argument to the contrary mistakenly relies on the date when each of those offenses was committed, rather than on the date when sentencing took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner also asserts that the conviction for failure to return a rental car (with the resulting $100 fine) was too trivial to be considered.  He points to U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(c)(1), which provides that some fifteen minor offenses that are there listed, \"and offenses similar to them,\" are to be counted only if, inter alia, the sentence therefor was at least one year of probation or thirty days of imprisonment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Yet his suggestion that the rental car conviction is \"similar\" to the offenses listed in Sec. 4A1.2(c)(1) appears dubious.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This argument, in any event, was not raised below and so has been waived.  And any error in this regard would plainly have been harmless.  Unlike more substantial prior sentences for which either two or three points are added to the CHC, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(a)-(b), the guidelines provide that one point shall be added for other prior sentences \"up to a total of 4 points for this item,\" id.  Sec.  4A1.1(c).  Included in petitioner's criminal history are at least five other convictions that, according to the presentence report (PSR), were eligible for a one-point addition but were not so counted because of the four-point maximum.  Accordingly, were the rental car conviction to be disregarded, one of these other convictions would be included in its stead-such that petitioner's CHC would not change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of petitioner's challenges to the CHC calculation thus prove meritless.  It follows that the failure of counsel to pursue these matters cannot be deemed ineffective assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Relevant Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court increased petitioner's base offense level by eight points under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1), based on a determination that the aggregate losses exceeded $200,000.  In so finding, the court not only took into account the losses resulting from the offenses of conviction, but also considered under the \"relevant conduct\" provision of Sec. 1B1.3(a) those losses stemming from some eleven other instances of mail fraud in which petitioner allegedly participated.  In an abstruse series of arguments, petitioner claims that the court erred in this regard.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, to the extent petitioner is alleging that the relevant conduct provision is unconstitutional per se, his argument can be summarily rejected.  See, e.g., United States v. Bennett, 37 F.3d 687, 692-94 (1st Cir. 1994);  United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 80-81 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1644 (1994);  United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 441 (1st Cir. 1989).  Second, to the extent he is contending that the evidence was insufficient to establish his involvement in the other mail frauds, it suffices to note that the district court was warranted in accepting as true all facts appearing in the PSR to which no objection had been voiced.  See, e.g., United States v. Fox, 889 F.2d 357, 359 (1st Cir. 1989).  Third, to the extent he is arguing that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the other mail frauds were \"part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan\" as the offenses of conviction, U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2), we disagree.  Each of the other frauds, involving efforts to defraud insurance companies by use of the mails between 1988 and 1990, readily falls within the scope of those terms.  See id.  Sec.  1B1.3, comment.  (n.9).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, to the extent petitioner is complaining of counsel's failure to object to the consideration of such relevant conduct, we find no error.  According to the PSR, petitioner had acknowledged his involvement in most of those other mail frauds to a confidential informant, who had captured such admissions on tape.  In the face of such evidence, counsel's decision not to contest these matters (and thereby risk, inter alia, forgoing the reduction for acceptance of responsibility) was well \"within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\"  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56 (1985) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, to the extent petitioner is objecting to the consideration of some $12,441 in losses resulting from a mail fraud involved in a related prosecution, the PSR specifically provided (in response to defense counsel's objection) that such losses would be excluded from that other case to avoid double- counting.  We thus perceive no error.  And again, any error in this regard would plainly have been harmless.  Given the grouping rule that was applied at sentencing, petitioner's offense level would have remained unchanged even if the losses had not exceeded $200,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3D1.4(a);  see also Lombardi, 5 F.3d at 570.  His overall restitution obligation likewise would have remained unaltered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Petitioner there advanced four challenges to his sentence, arguing that the court had erred (1) in its grouping of offenses, (2) by declining to depart downward on the basis of his age and health, (3) by awarding only two, rather than three, points for acceptance of responsibility, and (4) by ordering payment of a fine and restitution.  We found each of these contentions to be without merit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The offenses there specified include such infractions as contempt of court, gambling, resisting arrest, prostitution and trespassing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note, for example, that (according to the presentence report) petitioner was originally convicted of such offense in state district court and sentenced to sixty days imprisonment.

Petitioner eventually pled guilty to six of these offenses:  three counts of mail fraud (and conspiracy to commit same), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341;  two counts of engaging in a monetary transaction with criminally derived property, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1957;  and one count of using a fire to commit mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(h).  At sentencing, the district court imposed a 63-month prison term for the first five counts, to which was added a mandatory, consecutive 60-month sentence for the Sec. 844(h) offense.  On appeal, we affirmed petitioner's sentence in all respects.  United States v. Lombardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By way of the instant petition under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255, petitioner presents two new challenges to his sentence.  Specifically, he contends that the court (1) miscalculated his criminal history category and (2) erred in sentencing him on the basis of relevant conduct.  He also advances the derivative claim that his trial and appellate attorneys rendered ineffective assistance by failing to pursue these arguments.  We need not decide to what extent such claims might be forfeited, see, e.g., Lopez-Torres v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524127\"><a href=\"/opinion/524127/tomas-lopez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span> </span>(1989), or might otherwise not be cognizable in a Sec. 2255 proceeding, see, e.g., Knight v.

Criminal History Category</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's central challenge to the calculation of his criminal history category (CHC) is based on a misreading of the sentencing guidelines.  In determining the CHC, the district court, inter alia, awarded one point under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(c) for each of the following three state court convictions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to obtain money under false pretenses.

Offenses committed on June 28, 1976.  Petitioner sentenced on April 24, 1979, following nolo plea, to two years probation on each count, concurrent.
