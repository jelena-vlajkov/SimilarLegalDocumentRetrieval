MACEACHERN,\n\n                        Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n         Boudin, Gajarsa,* and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Cathryn A. Neaves for petitioner, appellant.\n     Natalie S. Monroe, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nBureau, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief,\nfor respondent, appellee.\n\n\n                          September 9, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           GAJARSA, Circuit Judge.           The issue before the court is\n\nwhether   an   application   for     state    post-conviction   relief   was\n\n“pending” within the meaning of the tolling provision of the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”),\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2), and, if not, whether the petitioner is\n\nentitled to equitable tolling of the AEDPA’s limitations period.\n\nCarl Drew appeals from the U.S. District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts’s dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas\n\ncorpus.   The district court dismissed Mr. Drew’s petition for lack\n\nof jurisdiction, holding that his petition was time-barred under\n\n§ 2244(d)(1)(A) and that he is not entitled to equitable tolling.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           The relevant facts are not in dispute. The Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (“SJC”) provides “extremely broad plenary\n\nreview” of convictions for a capital crime on direct appeal under\n\nchapter 278,    section   33E   of   the Massachusetts     General   Laws.1\n\nTrigones v. Attorney General, 652 N.E.2d 893, 895 (Mass. 1995); see\n\nalso Commonwealth v. Randolph, 780 N.E.2d 58, 67 (Mass. 2002) (“[A]\n\ndefendant’s conviction in a capital case . . . undergo[es] the\n\n\n\n     1\n       “The Massachusetts murder statute still provides that the\ndeath penalty is available for first-degree murder committed with\nextreme atrocity or cruelty, but the SJC has ruled that the death\npenalty violated a provision of the state constitution . . . .”\nObershaw v. Lanman, 453 F.3d 56, 60 n.2 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal\ncitations omitted).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fexacting     scrutiny    of    plenary      review   under       [section]    33E.”\n\n(alterations added)).         But “[a]fter receiving this plenary review,\n\na capital defendant may not appeal [to the SJC] from a decision on\n\na postconviction motion unless that motion raises a ‘new and\n\nsubstantial question’” as set forth in a “gatekeeper” petition to\n\na   single   justice    of    the    SJC.      Trigones,   652    N.E.2d     at   895\n\n(alteration added) (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 278, § 33E); see\n\nalso Randolph, 780 N.E.2d at 64 n.7.             In a section 33E petition, a\n\ncapital defendant files a petition for leave to appeal to the full\n\nSJC with a single justice of the SJC, who is commonly referred to\n\nas the “gatekeeper.”          Commonwealth v. Stote, 922 N.E.2d 768, 771\n\n(Mass. 2010) (referring to the single justice in a section 33E\n\npetition as the gatekeeper); Commonwealth v. Herbert, 838 N.E.2d\n\n1236, 1237 (Mass. 2005) (rescript) (same).             If the single justice\n\ndetermines that the petitioner raises both “new and substantial”\n\nissues, the justice will grant the petitioner leave to appeal to\n\nthe full SJC for review.            Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 278, § 33E (2008);\n\nsee also Pina v. Maloney, 565 F.3d 48, 51 n.2 (1st Cir. 2009);\n\nTrigones, 652 N.E.2d at 895-96.\n\n             On March 13, 1981, a jury convicted Mr. Drew of first-\n\ndegree murder in the Superior Court, and he was sentenced to life\n\nin prison without parole.           Over the next twenty-two years, the SJC\n\nwould consider a direct appeal from Mr. Drew’s murder conviction\n\nand appeals from his four denied motions for a new trial.                         As\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fexplained below, Mr. Drew’s current appeal centers on two separate\n\ngatekeeper petitions that he filed in 1992 and 2003.                Those\n\npetitions concerned his third and fourth motions for a new trial.\n\n           Mr. Drew filed his first two motions for a new trial in\n\nthe Superior Court on March 30, 1981, and February 17, 1983,\n\nrespectively.   After the Superior Court denied both motions, the\n\nSJC   consolidated   Mr.   Drew’s   direct   appeal    from   his   murder\n\nconviction and his appeals from the Superior Court’s denial of his\n\ntwo motions for a new trial.    On March 12, 1986, the SJC affirmed\n\nMr. Drew’s conviction and the denial of his two motions for a new\n\ntrial.   See Commonwealth v. Drew (“Drew I”), 489 N.E.2d 1233, 1236\n\n(Mass. 1986).\n\n           Nearly six years later, Mr. Drew filed his third motion\n\nfor a new trial as a pro se litigant.        In this motion, Mr. Drew\n\nalleged for the first time that his trial counsel and previous\n\nappellate counsel were ineffective, violating his Sixth Amendment\n\nright to the effective assistance of counsel.         See Commonwealth v.\n\nDrew (“Drew II”), No. SJ-2005-0074, slip op. at 6-7, 9 (Mass. Oct.\n\n17, 2005).   The Superior Court denied Mr. Drew’s third motion for\n\na new trial.\n\n           Again acting pro se, Mr. Drew timely filed a section 33E\n\ngatekeeper petition with the single justice on April 30, 1992.\n\nCommonwealth v. Drew (“Drew III”), 856 N.E.2d 808, 811 (Mass.\n\n2006).   In the two and a half years after Mr. Drew filed this\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\finitial gatekeeper petition, Massachusetts appointed four different\n\nattorneys to assist him with his petition, but they all neglected\n\nto make filings on his behalf.                 See Drew III, 856 N.E.2d at 811;\n\nDrew II, slip op. at 10 n.10. After the gatekeeper issued three\n\norders   to     show     cause,    the   justice     refused    to   grant    another\n\ncontinuance       and    dismissed       Mr.    Drew’s    petition   for     lack   of\n\nprosecution on December 15, 1994.                 Drew III, 856 N.E.2d at 811;\n\nDrew II, slip op. at 10 n.10.\n\n               In September 1995, Massachusetts appointed a new counsel\n\nfor Mr. Drew.         Drew II, slip op. at 11.           After inquiring about the\n\nstatus   of     Mr.     Drew’s    initial      gatekeeper    petition,     the   newly\n\nappointed counsel learned that it had been dismissed.                        See Drew\n\nIII, 856 N.E.2d at 811.           Upon learning of the dismissal, however,\n\ncounsel did not move for reconsideration of the dismissal nor file\n\na petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court.\n\n               Eight years later, on September 16, 2003, the same\n\ncounsel filed a fourth motion for a new trial, asserting, inter\n\nalia,    the     same    ineffective-assistance-of-counsel            claims      that\n\nMr. Drew presented in his 1992 gatekeeper petition.                          After an\n\neleven-day       evidentiary       hearing,       the     Superior   Court       denied\n\nMr. Drew’s fourth motion for a new trial.\n\n               Represented by the same counsel, Mr. Drew then filed his\n\nsecond gatekeeper petition on February 28, 2005. This petition was\n\ngranted in part, allowing the full SJC to hear Mr. Drew’s appeal\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fwith respect to some of his claims, namely that his trial counsel\n\nwas constitutionally ineffective.             Drew II, slip op. at 14; see\n\nalso Drew III, 856 N.E.2d at 814-20.              To satisfy section 33E’s\n\nrequirement that the gatekeeper petition raise “new” issues, the\n\nsingle justice treated the second gatekeeper petition as though it\n\nwere Mr. Drew’s first: “I am not prepared to preclude [Mr.] Drew\n\nfrom bringing substantial issues before the court because his\n\nlawyer proceeded to bring a new motion . . . rather than resurrect\n\nan old appeal that court appointed counsel failed to prosecute.”\n\nDrew II, slip op. at 11 (alterations added).             The single justice\n\nopined that he was “thus inclined to treat [the ineffective-\n\nassistance    claims]    of    [Mr.]    Drew’s    petition      as   if   [they]\n\nrepresent[ed] a continuation of the 1992 appeal.” Id. (alterations\n\nadded).    The single justice denied the second gatekeeper petition\n\nin all other respects.        Id. at 14.\n\n           On appeal before the full court, the SJC reasoned that\n\nMr. Drew could have raised his ineffective-assistance claims in his\n\nsecond motion for a new trial and thus had waived those claims.\n\nSee Drew III, 856 N.E.2d at 813.             Nevertheless, the SJC reviewed\n\nhis ineffective-assistance claims for a substantial risk of a\n\nmiscarriage of justice, but denied relief.              Id. at 814-20.        On\n\nDecember   20,   2006,   the    SJC    denied    Mr.   Drew’s    petition    for\n\nrehearing.   And on May 18, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court denied his\n\npetition for writ of certiorari.         Drew v. Massachusetts, 550 U.S.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f943 (2007) (mem.).\n\n          Not to be denied in his quest for relief, Mr. Drew filed\n\na pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district\n\ncourt on December 20, 2007. The district court referred the matter\n\nto a magistrate judge for a Report and Recommendation (“R&R”). The\n\nR&R recommended that the district court dismiss Mr. Drew’s habeas\n\npetition for lack of jurisdiction because he failed to file his\n\npetition within the AEDPA’s one-year statute of limitations under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A).    The magistrate judge also found that\n\nthe doctrine of equitable tolling did not apply to Mr. Drew’s\n\nhabeas petition.   The district court adopted the R&R and dismissed\n\nthe petition with prejudice.    However, the district court noted\n\nthat “because the issues are close, [it would] certify for appeal\n\nif requested.”   Addendum to Appellant’s Br. 17 (alteration added).\n\n          Upon Mr. Drew’s request, the district court certified his\n\ncase for appeal, and Mr. Drew timely filed a notice of appeal.   We\n\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253.\n\n                                II.\n\n          The federal courts have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(a) to consider a state prisoner’s petition for writ of\n\nhabeas corpus when the petitioner alleges that he is in state\n\ncustody in violation of the U.S. Constitution or federal law.\n\nCongress, however, placed limits on the federal courts’ ability to\n\ngrant a federal habeas petition.   One of those limits is a statute\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fof limitations: “A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an\n\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody\n\npursuant to the judgment of a State court.”         28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)\n\n(2006).   In a typical case, the clock on the one-year limitations\n\nperiod starts running when the state conviction becomes final: “The\n\nlimitation period shall run from the . . . date on which the\n\njudgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the\n\nexpiration   of     the   time     for   seeking    such     review.”       Id.\n\n§   2244(d)(1)(A)     (emphasis     added).        For     the   purposes    of\n\n§ 2244(d)(1)(A), a conviction is final when the “availability of\n\ndirect appeal to the state courts and to [the U.S. Supreme Court]\n\nhas been exhausted.”      Jimenez v. Quarterman, 129 S. Ct. 681, 685\n\n(2009) (alteration added) (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted). Because the AEDPA affects prisoners convicted before its\n\nenactment, the federal courts of appeals have uniformly created a\n\none-year grace period for prisoners whose state convictions became\n\nfinal before April 24, 1996--the day the AEDPA became effective.\n\nSee Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 183 & n.1 (2001).              Under this\n\ngrace period, prisoners, like Mr. Drew, who were convicted before\n\nthe AEDPA’s effective date had until April 24, 1997, to file a\n\nhabeas petition in federal district court.           See, e.g., Gaskins v.\n\nDuval, 183 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Petitioners can, however, stop the clock on the AEDPA’s\n\nstatute of limitations.          It has a tolling provision: “The time\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fduring which a properly filed application for State post-conviction\n\nor other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment\n\nor claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of\n\nlimitation under this subsection.”       28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).\n\n           In sum, once a state conviction is final, the AEDPA’s\n\nlimitations period begins to run.          If the petitioner files an\n\napplication for state post-conviction relief within a year after\n\nthe conviction is final, the limitations period is halted while the\n\napplication is pending, i.e., the limitations period is tolled.\n\nFor   prisoners   subject   to   the   one-year   grace   period,   their\n\nconviction is deemed “final” as of April 24, 1996, and the period\n\nbegins to run.\n\n           This case concerns whether Mr. Drew’s initial gatekeeper\n\npetition was “pending” within the meaning of § 2244(d)(2) as of\n\nApril 24, 1997, and, if not, whether he is entitled to equitable\n\ntolling of the AEDPA’s limitations period based on appointed\n\ncounsels’ seriatim neglect of his initial gatekeeper petition.         We\n\nconclude   that Mr. Drew’s habeas petition is time-barred under\n\n§ 2244(d)(1)(A) and that he is not entitled to equitable tolling.\n\nA. Tolling Under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2)\n\n           We review de novo a district court’s decision to dismiss\n\na habeas petition as time-barred.        Wood v. Spencer, 487 F.3d 1, 3\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).    Both parties agree that Mr. Drew’s conviction\n\nbecame final on June 12, 1986, which is the day three months after\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fthe SJC affirmed his conviction on direct appeal and the day on\n\nwhich his time to seek U.S. Supreme Court review expired.           See\n\nDrew I, 489 N.E.2d at 1233, 1245.        The parties further agree that\n\nMr. Drew is subject to the one-year grace period.         Consequently,\n\nthe clock for the AEDPA’s limitations period would have started\n\nrunning on April 24, 1996, unless Mr. Drew had “a properly filed\n\napplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review\n\n. . . pending” during the grace period.        28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).\n\nTherefore, we must decide whether Mr. Drew’s initial gatekeeper\n\npetition was “pending” during the grace period within the meaning\n\nof § 2244(d)(2).\n\n            In Carey v. Saffold, 536 U.S. 214 (2002), the Supreme\n\nCourt addressed the meaning of the term “pending” in § 2244(d)(2).\n\nThe Court noted that “[t]he dictionary defines ‘pending’ . . . as\n\n‘in continuance’ or ‘not yet decided.’” Id. at            219 (quoting\n\nWebster’s    Third   New   International    Dictionary   1669   (1993)).\n\nAccording to the Court, “[a]n application is pending as long as the\n\nordinary state collateral review process is ‘in continuance’–-i.e.,\n\n‘until the completion of’ that process.       In other words, until the\n\napplication has achieved final resolution through the State’s post-\n\nconviction procedures, by definition it remains ‘pending.’” Id. at\n\n219-20 (emphasis added).     Based on this definition, the Court held\n\nthat an application for state post-conviction relief is “pending”\n\nduring the interval between a lower court’s entry of judgment and\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthe filing of an appeal with a higher state court.             Id. at 220-21.\n\nThe Court remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit to determine\n\nwhether the petitioner’s four-and-a-half-month delay in filing his\n\npetition for an “original writ” was unreasonable under California’s\n\nprocedural rules.     Id. at 225-27.      Relevant to this appeal, the\n\nCourt deferred to California’s procedural rules to further the\n\npurposes of the AEDPA’s tolling provision: “[I]t is the State’s\n\ninterests that the tolling provision seeks to protect, and the\n\nState, through its supreme court decisions or legislation, can\n\nexplicate timing requirements . . . .”           Id. at 223.\n\n            Saffold and our precedent show that a state’s procedural\n\nrules control whether an application for state post-conviction\n\nrelief is pending under § 2244(d)(2).       See Saffold, 536 U.S. at 220\n\n(“[U]ntil the application has achieved final resolution through the\n\nState’s   post-conviction    procedures,    by     definition     it   remains\n\n‘pending.’”); Currie v. Matesanz, 281 F.3d 261, 267-68 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (interpreting “pending” in § 2244(d)(2) to include the gap\n\nbetween the date on which a trial court denied a petitioner’s\n\nmotion for a new trial and the date on which the petitioner filed\n\na section 33E gatekeeper petition).       Consequently, “an application\n\nfor [state] post-conviction relief is pending ‘from the time it is\n\nfirst filed until [the time it is] finally disposed of and further\n\nappellate   review   is   unavailable    under    the   particular     state’s\n\nprocedures.’” Currie, 281 F.3d at 263 (alterations added) (quoting\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fBennett v. Artuz, 199 F.3d 116, 120 (2d Cir. 1999)), aff’d on other\n\ngrounds, 531 U.S. 4 (2000).        In Massachusetts, a single justice’s\n\ndecision to deny a gatekeeper petition is “final and unreviewable,”\n\nHerbert, 838 N.E.2d at 1237 (internal quotation marks omitted),\n\neven when the single justice bases his opinion on procedural\n\ngrounds,   such   as   when   a   gatekeeper   petition   is   dismissed   as\n\nuntimely, see Commonwealth v. Nassar, 908 N.E.2d 371, 372-73 (Mass.\n\n2009) (rescript) (holding that a single justice’s decision was\n\n“final and unreviewable” when the justice denied a gatekeeper\n\npetition as untimely); Mains v. Commonwealth, 739 N.E.2d 1125, 1131\n\nn.10 (Mass. 2000) (holding that gatekeeper petitions must be filed\n\nwithin thirty days of the denial of a motion for a new trial).2\n\n           Based on Saffold and our precedent, Mr. Drew’s initial\n\ngatekeeper petition ceased to be pending for the purposes of\n\n§ 2244(d)(2) when it was dismissed for lack of prosecution on\n\nDecember 15, 1994. Because the single justice dismissed Mr. Drew’s\n\ninitial gatekeeper petition, see Drew III, 856 N.E.2d at 811, the\n\ndismissal was “final and unreviewable,” Herbert, 838 N.E.2d at 1237\n\n\n\n     2\n       The SJC has stated that “[t]here may be some circumstances\nwhere the full court would consider whether a single justice erred\nby denying a gatekeeper petition on procedural grounds.” Nassar,\n908 N.E.2d at 373 n.2.    But Mr. Drew has not alleged that the\nsingle justice erred in dismissing his initial gatekeeper petition\nfor lack of prosecution. Consequently, we need not address whether\na single justice’s potential procedural error in dismissing a\ngatekeeper petition could affect a dismissed petition’s status as\n“pending” under § 2244(d)(2) or a petitioner’s entitlement to\nequitable tolling.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted). With the imprimatur of a final\n\nand unreviewable dismissal, Mr. Drew’s initial gatekeeper petition\n\n“achieved    final    resolution     through         [Massachusetts’s]       post-\n\nconviction   procedures,”      Saffold,    536   U.S.    at    220    (alteration\n\nadded), and “further appellate review [was] unavailable under\n\n[Massachusetts’s] procedures,” Currie, 281 F.3d at 263 (alterations\n\nadded) (internal quotation marks omitted).              Therefore, Mr. Drew’s\n\ninitial gatekeeper petition was not pending when the grace period\n\nexpired on April 24, 1997.        As the district court properly held,\n\nMr. Drew was time-barred under § 2244(d)(1)(A) from filing a\n\nfederal habeas petition as of April 24, 1997.\n\n            Interpreting      “pending”    in    §    2244(d)(2)      to   exclude\n\napplications    for   state    post-conviction        relief   that    a   state’s\n\nhighest court dismissed on procedural grounds comports with how the\n\nfederal courts of appeals have interpreted “pending” in similar\n\ncases.   A majority of federal courts of appeals have held that an\n\nuntimely application for post-conviction relief that a state court\n\nreopens is not “pending” under § 2244(d)(2) “between the expiration\n\nof the time for appeal and the filing of a petition for belated\n\nappeal.”    Streu v. Dormire, 557 F.3d 960, 966 (8th Cir. 2009); see\n\nalso Moore v. Crosby, 321 F.3d 1377, 1380 (11th Cir. 2003); Allen\n\nv. Mitchell, 276 F.3d 183, 185-86 (4th Cir. 2001); Melancon v.\n\nKaylo, 259 F.3d 401, 406-07 (5th Cir. 2001); Gibson v. Klinger,\n\n232 F.3d 799, 806-07 (10th Cir. 2000); Fernandez v. Sternes,\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f227 F.3d 977, 979-81 (7th Cir. 2000).        But see Saffold v. Newland,\n\n250 F.3d 1262 (9th Cir. 2000), vacated sub nom. Carey v. Saffold,\n\n536 U.S. 514 (2002).\n\n             Mr. Drew argues that his initial gatekeeper petition was\n\npending from the date he first filed it, April 30, 1992, until the\n\ndate the SJC denied his final petition for rehearing, December 20,\n\n2006–-even     though   the   single    justice   dismissed   his     initial\n\ngatekeeper petition for failure to prosecute.           Under Mr. Drew’s\n\nreasoning, he had until December 20, 2007, to file his petition for\n\nwrit of habeas corpus because the single justice deemed his second\n\ngatekeeper petition to be a continuation of the first.                But the\n\nsingle justice did not reopen or reinstate Mr. Drew’s initial\n\ngatekeeper petition.3         Rather, the single justice treated the\n\nsecond gatekeeper petition as though it were Mr. Drew’s first for\n\nthe purposes of satisfying the requirement that a gatekeeper\n\npetition present “new” issues.         See Drew II, slip op. at 11.       The\n\nsingle justice did so to compensate for the four appointed counsels\n\nwho failed to prosecute the initial petition:         “I am thus inclined\n\nto   treat   [the   ineffective-assistance    claims]   of    [Mr.]    Drew’s\n\n\n\n      3\n       Although the single justice did not in fact reopen or\nreinstate Mr. Drew’s initial gatekeeper petition, the cases cited\nabove, see, e.g., Streu, 557 F.3d at 966, create doubt whether such\na reopening and reinstatement for state law purposes would make the\npetition one that had been “pending” for federal habeas purposes\nthroughout the lengthy period between its dismissal and its\nresurrection.   However, we need not decide that issue for this\ncircuit in this case.\n\n                                   -14-\n\fpetition as if [they] represent[ed] a continuation of the 1992\n\nappeal.”      Drew II, slip op. at 11 (alterations added).              The single\n\njustice’s conclusion did not alter the fact that Mr. Drew’s initial\n\ngatekeeper petition was dismissed.                The dismissal of the initial\n\ngatekeeper      petition    for   lack       of   prosecution   terminated      the\n\nproceeding, and the petition ceased to be pending.\n\n              In support of his argument, Mr. Drew relies on the\n\nSupreme Court’s recent interpretation of the term “final” in\n\n§ 2244(d)(1)(A).     In Jimenez v. Quarterman, 129 S. Ct. 681 (2009),\n\nthe   Court    determined    that     a    conviction   was   “final”    when   the\n\n“availability of direct appeal to the state courts and to [the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court] has been exhausted.” Id. at 685 (alterations added)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).                 Based on this\n\ninterpretation, the Court held that a petition is not “final” under\n\n§ 2244(d)(1)(A) when a state court grants a petitioner the right to\n\nfile an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review,\n\nbut before the petitioner seeks federal habeas relief. Id. at 686.\n\n              According    to   Mr.       Drew,   Jimenez   indicates    that   in\n\nextraordinary circumstances, state court action can change how the\n\nAEDPA’s limitations period is tolled.                Mr. Drew argues that the\n\nsingle justice’s decision to treat Mr. Drew’s second gatekeeper\n\npetition as though it were his first “altered the meaning of\n\n‘pending’ in this particular case.”               Appellant’s Br. 15-16.        But\n\nthe rule in Jimenez simply reinforces that Mr. Drew’s conviction\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fwas final after he exhausted his direct appeals to the SJC and the\n\nSupreme Court.    See 129 S. Ct. at 685.        Jimenez only addresses the\n\nterm “final” in § 2244(d)(1)(A), not “pending” in § 2244(d)(2).\n\nMoreover, the Court’s rule in Jimenez promoted the AEDPA’s goal of\n\ngiving    state   courts     the    opportunity     to    first   address   a\n\nconstitutional challenge in an untimely appeal.             Id.   Similarly,\n\nholding that Mr. Drew’s initial gatekeeper petition was not pending\n\nfrom 1994 to 2006 provides petitioners with an incentive to respect\n\nstate procedural rules.       “[I]t is the State’s interests that the\n\ntolling provision seeks to protect, and the State, through its\n\nsupreme   court   decisions    or   legislation,    can    explicate   timing\n\nrequirements . . . .”      Saffold, 536 U.S. at 223.      In Massachusetts,\n\nwhen a single justice dismisses a gatekeeper petition on procedural\n\ngrounds, the dismissal is final and unreviewable, making the\n\npetition no longer pending.\n\nB. Equitable Tolling\n\n           We “review[] a district court’s denial of equitable\n\ntolling for abuse of discretion.”           Trapp v. Spencer, 479 F.3d 53,\n\n58 (1st Cir. 2007) (alteration added).            Because Mr. Drew did not\n\ntimely file his federal habeas petition, we must determine whether\n\nit was an abuse of discretion for the district court to not\n\nequitably toll the AEDPA’s limitations period based on appointed\n\ncounsels’ seriatim neglect of his initial gatekeeper petition.\n\n           The Supreme Court recently held that “§ 2244(d) is\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fsubject to equitable tolling in appropriate cases.”                     Holland v.\n\nFlorida, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 2560 (2010).                The Court established a\n\ntwo-prong      test:    “[A]   ‘petitioner’     is    ‘entitled    to    equitable\n\ntolling’ only if he shows ‘(1) that he has been pursuing his rights\n\ndiligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in\n\nhis way’ and prevented timely filing.”               Id. at 2562 (quoting Pace\n\nv. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 418 (2005)).\n\n            In reference to the first prong, the Court stated that\n\n“[t]he   diligence      required     for   equitable     tolling    purposes     is\n\nreasonable diligence, not maximum feasible diligence.” Id. at 2565\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).             In reference to the second\n\nprong,   the    Court    explained     that   “‘a    garden   variety    claim   of\n\nexcusable neglect,’ such as a simple ‘miscalculation’ that leads a\n\nlawyer to miss a filing deadline, does not warrant equitable\n\ntolling.” Id. at 2564 (quoting Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs,\n\n498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990) and Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U.S. 327, 336\n\n(2007)).       Nevertheless,     the    Court   made    clear   that     egregious\n\nattorney neglect could constitute an extraordinary circumstance.\n\nId. at 2564 (collecting cases).\n\n            Based on this two-prong test, the Court held that the\n\npetitioner had diligently pursued his rights by sending numerous\n\nletters concerning a federal habeas petition to his appointed\n\ncounsel, who neglected to respond.              Id. at 2565.       However, the\n\nCourt remanded the case to the Eleventh Circuit to determine in the\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\ffirst instance whether counsel’s failure to respond to petitioner’s\n\nnumerous letters, failure to accurately inform petitioner of the\n\nlaw, and failure to keep petitioner apprised of the status of his\n\ncase constituted an extraordinary circumstance.    Id. at 2564-65.\n\n           Mr. Drew fails to satisfy the two prongs for equitable\n\ntolling.   First, Mr. Drew was not reasonably diligent in pursuing\n\nhis rights for state post-conviction relief from September 1995 to\n\nSeptember 2003.   Although it is not clear from the record exactly\n\nwhen Mr. Drew became aware that his initial gatekeeper petition was\n\ndismissed, it can be reasonably assumed that Mr. Drew’s newly\n\nappointed counsel informed him of the dismissal when counsel\n\nlearned of it in September 1995.      Mr. Drew has not produced any\n\nevidence that he was unaware of the dismissal and has offered no\n\nexplanation as to why he did not pursue other relief between\n\nSeptember 1995 and September 2003. See Appellant’s Br. 21-23; Oral\n\nArgument at 3:46-4:53, Drew v. MacEachern, No. 09-1571, available\n\nat http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/files/audio/audiorss.php.     Absent\n\nevidence that Mr. Drew’s counsel failed to keep Mr. Drew apprised\n\nof his petition’s status, see Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2564, we must\n\nassume that counsel fulfilled his professional responsibility to\n\ncommunicate with his client and attribute counsel’s inaction to\n\nMr. Drew, see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 753 (1991) (“[T]he\n\nattorney is the petitioner’s agent when acting, or failing to act,\n\nin furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must ‘bear the\n\n\n                               -18-\n\frisk of attorney error.’” (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478,\n\n488 (1986))); Model Rules of Prof’l Conduct R. 1.4(a)(3) (2007) (“A\n\nlawyer shall . . . keep the client reasonably informed about the\n\nstatus of the matter . . . .”).     After Mr. Drew discovered that his\n\ninitial gatekeeper       petition had been dismissed, he sat on his\n\nrights.   Between September 1995 and September 2003, Mr. Drew did\n\nnot file a petition to reopen the initial gatekeeper petition, did\n\nnot file another gatekeeper petition, and did not take any other\n\nactions   that   could   have   potentially    provided    post-conviction\n\nrelief. It was not until eight years after Massachusetts appointed\n\nhim new counsel that a fourth motion for a new trial was filed.\n\nThis   eight-year   hiatus   demonstrates     that   Mr.   Drew   failed    to\n\ndiligently pursue his rights.      Therefore, Mr. Drew is not entitled\n\nto equitable tolling because he has failed to show “‘that he has\n\nbeen pursuing his rights diligently.’” Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2562\n\n(quoting Pace, 544 U.S. at 418).\n\n           Second, even if Mr. Drew had diligently pursued his\n\nrights, he has not alleged any extraordinary circumstance that\n\nwould have prevented him from seeking post-conviction relief after\n\ndiscovering the dismissal of his initial gatekeeper petition.              To\n\nbe sure, the four appointed counsels’ failure to take any action on\n\nMr. Drew’s behalf indicates extraordinary attorney neglect.                See\n\nDrew II, slip op. at 10 n.10.     But this failure by his attorneys to\n\nact diligently in pursuit of appropriate remedies occurred before\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fthe AEDPA became law, and Mr. Drew has not submitted any evidence\n\nto support his argument that he was prevented from further pursuing\n\npost-conviction relief during the grace period. Although the first\n\nfour counsels’ neglect was egregious, it did nothing to prevent\n\nMr. Drew’s subsequent counsel from seeking appropriate relief after\n\nthe initial gatekeeper petition was dismissed.   The four appointed\n\ncounsels’ poor lawyering did not limit Mr. Drew’s ability to seek\n\nan appropriate remedy during the grace period.       Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Drew’s\n\nrequest to equitably toll the period within which his petition had\n\nto be filed.   Mr. Drew failed to show “‘that some extraordinary\n\ncircumstance stood in his way’ and prevented [him from] timely\n\nfiling” a federal habeas petition.    Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2562\n\n(alteration added)(quoting Pace, 544 U.S. at 418).\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f",

Over the next twenty-two years, the SJC\n\nwould consider a direct appeal from Mr. Drew’s murder conviction\n\nand appeals from his four denied motions for a new trial.

Those\n\npetitions concerned his third and fourth motions for a new trial.\n\n           Mr. Drew filed his first two motions for a new trial in\n\nthe Superior Court on March 30, 1981, and February 17, 1983,\n\nrespectively.   After the Superior Court denied both motions, the\n\nSJC   consolidated   Mr.   Drew’s   direct   appeal    from   his   murder\n\nconviction and his appeals from the Superior Court’s denial of his\n\ntwo motions for a new trial.    On March 12, 1986, the SJC affirmed\n\nMr. Drew’s conviction and the denial of his two motions for a new\n\ntrial.   See Commonwealth v.

And on May 18, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court denied his\n\npetition for writ of certiorari.         Drew v. Massachusetts, 550 U.S.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f943 (2007) (mem.).\n\n          Not to be denied in his quest for relief, Mr. Drew filed\n\na pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district\n\ncourt on December 20, 2007. The district court referred the matter\n\nto a magistrate judge for a Report and Recommendation (“R&R”). The\n\nR&R recommended that the district court dismiss Mr. Drew’s habeas\n\npetition for lack of jurisdiction because he failed to file his\n\npetition within the AEDPA’s one-year statute of limitations under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A).    The magistrate judge also found that\n\nthe doctrine of equitable tolling did not apply to Mr. Drew’s\n\nhabeas petition.   The district court adopted the R&R and dismissed\n\nthe petition with prejudice.    However, the district court noted\n\nthat “because the issues are close, [it would] certify for appeal\n\nif requested.”   Addendum to Appellant’s Br. 17 (alteration added).\n\n          Upon Mr. Drew’s request, the district court certified his\n\ncase for appeal, and Mr. Drew timely filed a notice of appeal.   We\n\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253.\n\n                                II.\n\n          The federal courts have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(a) to consider a state prisoner’s petition for writ of\n\nhabeas corpus when the petitioner alleges that he is in state\n\ncustody in violation of the U.S. Constitution or federal law.\n\nCongress, however, placed limits on the federal courts’ ability to\n\ngrant a federal habeas petition.   One of those limits is a statute\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fof limitations: “A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an\n\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody\n\npursuant to the judgment of a State court.”         28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)\n\n(2006).   In a typical case, the clock on the one-year limitations\n\nperiod starts running when the state conviction becomes final: “The\n\nlimitation period shall run from the . . . date on which the\n\njudgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the\n\nexpiration   of     the   time     for   seeking    such     review.”       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\n§   2244(d)(1)(A) </span><pre class=\"inline\">    (emphasis     added).        For     the   purposes    of\n\n§ 2244(d)(1)(A), a conviction is final when the “availability of\n\ndirect appeal to the state courts and to [the U.S. Supreme Court]\n\nhas been exhausted.”      Jimenez v. Quarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145924\"><a href=\"/opinion/145924/jimenez-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the AEDPA affects prisoners convicted before its\n\nenactment, the federal courts of appeals have uniformly created a\n\none-year grace period for prisoners whose state convictions became\n\nfinal before April 24, 1996--the day the AEDPA became effective.\n\nSee Duncan v. Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269282/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 183 & n.1 (2001).              Under this\n\ngrace period, prisoners, like Mr. Drew, who were convicted before\n\nthe AEDPA’s effective date had until April 24, 1997, to file a\n\nhabeas petition in federal district court.           See, e.g., Gaskins v.\n\nDuval, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198545\"><a href=\"/opinion/198545/gaskins-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Petitioners can, however, stop the clock on the AEDPA’s\n\nstatute of limitations.          It has a tolling provision: “The time\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fduring which a properly filed application for State post-conviction\n\nor other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment\n\nor claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of\n\nlimitation under this subsection.”       28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).\n\n           In sum, once a state conviction is final, the AEDPA’s\n\nlimitations period begins to run.          If the petitioner files an\n\napplication for state post-conviction relief within a year after\n\nthe conviction is final, the limitations period is halted while the\n\napplication is pending, i.e., the limitations period is tolled.\n\nFor   prisoners   subject   to   the   one-year   grace   period,   their\n\nconviction is deemed “final” as of April 24, 1996, and the period\n\nbegins to run.\n\n           This case concerns whether Mr. Drew’s initial gatekeeper\n\npetition was “pending” within the meaning of § 2244(d)(2) as of\n\nApril 24, 1997, and, if not, whether he is entitled to equitable\n\ntolling of the AEDPA’s limitations period based on appointed\n\ncounsels’ seriatim neglect of his initial gatekeeper petition.         We\n\nconclude   that Mr. Drew’s habeas petition is time-barred under\n\n§ 2244(d)(1)(A) and that he is not entitled to equitable tolling.\n\nA. Tolling Under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2)\n\n           We review de novo a district court’s decision to dismiss\n\na habeas petition as time-barred.        Wood v.

The parties further agree that\n\nMr. Drew is subject to the one-year grace period.         Consequently,\n\nthe clock for the AEDPA’s limitations period would have started\n\nrunning on April 24, 1996, unless Mr. Drew had “a properly filed\n\napplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review\n\n. . . pending” during the grace period.        28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).\n\nTherefore, we must decide whether Mr. Drew’s initial gatekeeper\n\npetition was “pending” during the grace period within the meaning\n\nof § 2244(d)(2).\n\n            In Carey v.

Under Mr. Drew’s\n\nreasoning, he had until December 20, 2007, to file his petition for\n\nwrit of habeas corpus because the single justice deemed his second\n\ngatekeeper petition to be a continuation of the first.                But the\n\nsingle justice did not reopen or reinstate Mr. Drew’s initial\n\ngatekeeper petition.3         Rather, the single justice treated the\n\nsecond gatekeeper petition as though it were Mr. Drew’s first for\n\nthe purposes of satisfying the requirement that a gatekeeper\n\npetition present “new” issues.         See Drew II, slip op. at 11.       The\n\nsingle justice did so to compensate for the four appointed counsels\n\nwho failed to prosecute the initial petition:         “I am thus inclined\n\nto   treat   [the   ineffective-assistance    claims]   of    [Mr.]    Drew’s\n\n\n\n      3\n       Although the single justice did not in fact reopen or\nreinstate Mr. Drew’s initial gatekeeper petition, the cases cited\nabove, see, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433434\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Streu,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1433434/streu-v-dormire/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, create doubt whether such\na reopening and reinstatement for state law purposes would make the\npetition one that had been “pending” for federal habeas purposes\nthroughout the lengthy period between its dismissal and its\nresurrection.

The four appointed\n\ncounsels’ poor lawyering did not limit Mr. Drew’s ability to seek\n\nan appropriate remedy during the grace period.       Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Drew’s\n\nrequest to equitably toll the period within which his petition had\n\nto be filed.
