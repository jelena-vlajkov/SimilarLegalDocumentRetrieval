Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Cyr, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nDale Tuttle on brief pro se.\r                       \r\nDonald  K. Stern,  United States  Attorney,  and David  S. Mackey,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Pro  se appellant Dale Tuttle,  who is\r                                          \r\n\nimprisoned  in Massachusetts on  an armed robbery conviction,\r\n\nappeals  from the  district court's  dismissal of  his habeas\r\n\npetition.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Tuttle  committed  the  robbery  for  which  he  is\r\n\npresently confined while on federal parole.  Accordingly, the\r\n\nUnited  States Parole  Commission  issued a  warrant for  his\r\n\narrest,  but  placed  it  as   a  detainer  against  him   in\r\n\nMassachusetts.  In his habeas petition, Tuttle sought removal\r\n\nof  the detainer, alleging that the Commission had not held a\r\n\nparole  revocation hearing or  conducted timely dispositional\r\n\nreview of the detainer.  Both parties agree that, in order to\r\n\nobtain habeas relief, Tuttle  must show that the Commission's\r\n\nalleged delay has prejudiced him.\r\n\n          Tuttle argues that  he has been prejudiced  because\r\n\nmitigating evidence that might have induced the Commission to\r\n\npermit  his continued  release on  parole despite  the parole\r\n\nviolation  has been  lost during  the period  of delay.   For\r\n\npurposes  of this opinion, we assume, but do not decide, that\r\n\nthe  loss  of  mitigating   evidence  relevant  to  a  parole\r\n\nrevocation hearing  or dispositional review  would constitute\r\n\nprejudice.1   See  United States v.  Williams, 558  F.2d 224,\r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  A few courts have also  suggested that due process rights\r\nmay be implicated if delay in executing a warrant lodged as a\r\ndetainer  might result  in  the loss  of mitigating  evidence\r\nrelevant to the decision to revoke parole.  See United States\r                                                                         \r\nv. Williams, 558  F.2d 224, 227 (5th Cir. 1977); U.S. ex rel.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n227 (5th Cir. 1977) (\"even if [a parolee] admits the [parole]\r\n\nviolation, he  may be  prejudiced if delay  has impaired  his\r\n\nability to present evidence of mitigating circumstances  that\r\n\nmight affect the decision to incarcerate him\").  But, because\r\n\nTuttle's  claims of  prejudice  are  conclusory  in  critical\r\n\nrespects  or otherwise  unpersuasive, habeas  relief was  not\r\n\nwarranted,  nor was an evidentiary  hearing.  See McDonald v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nNew Mexico Parole Board,  955 F.2d 631, 634 (10th  Cir. 1991)\r                                   \r\n\n(dismissal of habeas petition  asserting delay in executing a\r\n\nwarrant   was  justified   in   part   because   petitioner's\r\n\nallegations  of prejudice were conclusory), cert. denied, 504\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 920 (1992).\r\n\n          Tuttle claims that his probation officers no longer\r\n\nremember his good conduct while on parole, but he proffers no\r\n\nconfirming  statement by  those officers  and does  not state\r\n\nthat they  are unavailable  to provide  such statements.   He\r\n\nalso alleges  that he  cannot show his  continuous employment\r\n\nwhile on  parole, because \"over the years\" his employers have\r\n\nmoved away or gone out of business.  Even if  true, this fact\r\n\nwould  not  show  prejudice.    Tuttle  identifies  only  one\r\n\nemployer, but  he gives no  details why witnesses  or records\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nCaruso v. U.S. Board  of Parole, 570 F.2d 1150, 1154 (3d Cir.\r                                           \r\n1978).  Ordinarily,  a parole revocation hearing  need not be\r\nheld  until the warrant is  executed.  See  Moody v. Daggett,\r                                                                        \r\n429 U.S.  78, 89 (1976).  In  view of our disposition herein,\r\nwe need  not  address the  question  raised in  Williams  and\r                                                                    \r\nCaruso.\r                  \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nfrom that employer  are unavailable,  and he  does not  state\r\n\nwhen  they became  unavailable.   See  Poynor v.  U.S. Parole\r                                                                         \r\n\nComm'n,  878 F.2d  275, 277  (9th Cir.  1989) (to  constitute\r                  \r\n\nprejudice, the mitigating evidence must have been lost during\r\n\nthe  period of  delay by  the Commission).   Finally,  Tuttle\r\n\nalleges that  his girlfriend, who  died in  1990, could  have\r\n\ntestified  to  certain facts  supporting  Tuttle's allegation\r\n\nthat he committed the  robbery in order to  help her pay  her\r\n\nmedical costs.  Tuttle does not say that she did not have the\r\n\nmoney for treatment.  The loss  of his girlfriend's testimony\r\n\nwas not prejudicial.   Tuttle mentions that there  are \"other\r\n\nwitnesses\" who  could also attest  to these \"facts\"  but with\r\n\nwhom he has  \"lost touch.\"  He does not say  when he fell out\r\n\nof contact with these witnesses  or whether he ever attempted\r\n\nto reach them.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
