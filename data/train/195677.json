Feeley, Assistant  United States  Attorney, with  whom\n                  \nDonald K. Stern, United States  Attorney, was on brief for  the United\n           \nStates.\n\n                                         \n\n                       October 21, 1994\n                                         \n\n     BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.   On September  5, 1991, a  grand\n                          \n\njury indicted  Antonio Medina  Puerta, charging him  with one\n\ncount of bank  fraud under 18 U.S.C.   1344  and one count of\n\ntransportation  in foreign commerce of stolen or fraudulently\n\nobtained funds  under 18  U.S.C.    2314.   The  gist of  the\n\nevents  described  in  the  indictment was  that  Medina  had\n\ndeposited  a  $365 check  in  his  Bank  of  Boston  account,\n\nknowingly  misrepresented the amount  as $365,000, ultimately\n\nreceived  a  credit  of $365,000  to  his  account,  and then\n\ntransferred $350,000 of these fraudulently obtained funds  to\n\nhis account in an English bank.\n\n     At arraignment  on October 8, 1991, the magistrate-judge\n\nordered  that pre-trial  motions by the  defense be  filed by\n\nNovember 1, 1991.  On this deadline, Medina filed a number of\n\nmotions that were subsequently resolved.  Medina's trial date\n\nwas  repeatedly delayed,  largely at  his own  request, until\n\nJanuary  4, 1993.   In  the meantime,  on November  24, 1992,\n\nfollowing a  change of  counsel by  Medina,  his new  counsel\n\nsubmitted five additional pre-trial motions, accompanied by a\n\nmotion seeking leave to file the motions late.  \n\n     One of these motions--with which  this appeal is in part\n\nconcerned--asked  that the  case be  dismissed on  the ground\n\nthat  it was  being  pursued in  breach of  a promise  by the\n\nprosecutor  made in  1987  not to  prosecute  if Medina  made\n\nrestitution to the  bank of $200,000.  The government opposed\n\n                             -2-\n\nthe motion  to file out of  time.  On December  30, 1992, the\n\ndistrict court denied the request to file motions out of time\n\n(with exceptions  not here relevant), ruling  that good cause\n\nhad not been shown for the late filing.  The  court also said\n\nthat it had \"nevertheless\"  examined the substantive  motions\n\nto see whether an  exception should be made in  the interests\n\nof  justice; in giving a negative answer, the court found the\n\nassertions made  in  support of  the motion  to dismiss  were\n\ninsufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing.\n\n     Medina was tried in  January 1993.  The  evidence, taken\n\nin the  light most  favorable to the  government, see  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Ford, 22 F.3d 374, 382 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 63\n                                                         \n\nU.S.L.W.  3265 (U.S. Oct. 3, 1994), showed the following.  In\n\n1986 Medina was a research associate at a non-profit research\n\norganization  in  Boston  then  known  as  the  Eye  Research\n\nInstitute.  Medina  had been born and raised in Spain and was\n\nfluent  in both English and Spanish.  He had Spanish graduate\n\ndegrees in  optics and engineering  and a graduate  degree in\n\nelectrical  engineering  from   Massachusetts  Institute   of\n\nTechnology.  \n\n     On November  3, 1986,  Medina deposited  a check  in his\n\naccount in  that branch of  the Bank  of Boston where  he did\n\nmost of  his banking.  The check was a bank check prepared by\n\nBanco Central  of Spain, dated  October 30, 1986,  at Toledo,\n\nSpain,  and  was   made  payable  to  Medina.    The  written\n\n                             -3-\n\ndesignation  of the  amount  was, in  Spanish, \"Dolares  USA,\n\nTrescientos Sesenta  Y  Cinco,\" which  translates  as  \"three\n\nhundred  and sixty-five  U.S. dollars.\"   There  was also  an\n\narabic-numeral expression of the amount in a small box on the\n\nright-hand  side of  the check:   \"USD  365,ooo.\"   The words\n\n\"First National Bank of Boston\" appear on the check, and both\n\nthe  government and Medina have described it as a check drawn\n\non  Banco  Central's  own  checking account  at  the  Bank of\n\nBoston.\n\n     When  Medina  deposited  the  check in  his  account  on\n\nNovember 3, 1986, he listed the amount on the deposit slip as\n\n\"$365,000.\"  Two  days later, on November  5, Medina returned\n\nto   the   branch   and    requested   a   customer   service\n\nrepresentative,   Lisa  Popielski,  to   wire  $350,000  from\n\nMedina's checking  account to an  account in England.   Apart\n\nfrom  the  November 3  deposit,  Medina's  balance was  about\n\n$3,000.   Popielski said that  she needed to  verify that the\n\ncheck  had been collected and asked Medina to return the next\n\nday.   When Medina returned on November 6, Popielski told him\n\nthat  the $365,000 credit  had been deleted  from his account\n\nand the check had been returned to him by mail.  She told him\n\nto bring  the check back to  her if he intended  to redeposit\n\nit.\n\n     The following day, November  7, Medina returned with the\n\ncheck  and  Popielski told  Medina  that the  check  had been\n\n                             -4-\n\nreturned for lack of his endorsement; he then signed the back\n\nof  the check, Popielski filled out a second deposit slip for\n\nhim in  the amount  of $365,000,  and Medina  redeposited the\n\ncheck into his account.   On November 12, Medina  returned to\n\nthe  bank and  signed a  wire transfer  order, directing  the\n\ntransfer of $350,000  to an  account in his  name at  Lloyd's\n\nBank in  Cambridge, England.   Later  that morning the  funds\n\nwere wired to England.\n\n     When  interviewed by  the  FBI in  early December  1986,\n\nMedina admitted that he had deposited the check but explained\n\nthat he thought  that the  check was funding  from a  Spanish\n\nministry  for  a  research grant  for  his  work  at the  Eye\n\nResearch Institute.   He  said  that he  had purchased  about\n\n$150,000 worth  of equipment in  Spain where it  remained and\n\nwhere  some  of the  research was  to  be conducted.   Medina\n\nsubsequently gave to the FBI a letter from a Spanish ministry\n\nstating that a committee had agreed to propose the funding of\n\na grant.\n\n     Medina  also submitted  to  the FBI  a summary  document\n\nprepared  within  the  National Institutes  of  Health  which\n\nrecommended NIH approval of  a research application by Medina\n\nwith  proposed funding  of $282,286.   There was  evidence at\n\ntrial that  this application had never  been finally approved\n\nand that, if it  had been funded, the Eye  Research Institute\n\nand not Medina would have received the funds.  There was also\n\n                             -5-\n\nsome evidence,  apparently disputed, that Medina  had in fact\n\npurchased $138,755 in specialized equipment in Spain.  \n\n     At  trial  it  developed  that  the  bank  had  stumbled\n\nrepeatedly.   The processing section of the  bank had queried\n\nBanco Central about  the check,  and on November  6, the  day\n\nbefore Medina  had redeposited  the check, Banco  Central had\n      \n\nwired  that the proper  amount of the  check was $365.   When\n\nMedina  redeposited the check  on November  7, only  $365 was\n\ndebited  against  Banco  Central's  account,  but Medina  was\n\ncredited with a $365,000  deposit.  An interoffice adjustment\n\nslip was prepared to reduce Medina's deposit by $364,635, but\n\nMedina's account records were not corrected until on or about\n\nNovember  25 when  most  of the  money  had long  since  been\n\ntransferred to England.\n\n     Although Medina  did not testify, his  position at trial\n\nwas  that this was an  innocent misunderstanding.  Medina did\n\npresent  an expert witness  who was  familiar with  Spain and\n\nSpanish  accounting  who gave  testimony  on the  differences\n\nbetween  American and  Spanish practices  in the  writing and\n\npunctuation  of   arabic  numbers  on  large   checks.    The\n\ngovernment's position was that  Medina had certainly read the\n\nwritten  Spanish  words  on  the  check,  which  indisputedly\n\nrepresented its amount as $365, and had known that he was not\n\nentitled to $365,000.\n\n                             -6-\n\n     On January 28, 1993,  the jury convicted Medina  on both\n\ncounts.  Thereafter, Medina filed post-trial motions renewing\n\nhis request  for an  evidentiary hearing on  the government's\n\nsupposed  breach of  a  promise  not  to  prosecute.    In  a\n\nsupplemental memorandum, Medina said that new evidence showed\n\nthat the government had a motive to retaliate which explained\n\nits  breach of  the alleged  promise not  to prosecute.   The\n\ncourt denied the motions, calling the proffer inadequate.  On\n\nSeptember 30,  1993, the court sentenced Medina to 18 months'\n\nimprisonment   and  required   that   Medina  pay   fines  or\n\nrestitution  in a total amount of $150,000.  The court stayed\n\nthe sentence pending this appeal.\n\n     Medina's initial arguments on  appeal relate to his pre-\n\nand post-trial requests for  a hearing on his claim  that the\n\ngovernment  breached  its   promise  not   to  prosecute   if\n\nrestitution were made.  The government says that the original\n\npre-trial  motion  was  submitted  late,  together  with  the\n\nrequest for leave to  file; leave was not granted  because no\n\nadequate excuse for the  delay was given; and that  should be\n\nthe  end of the  matter.  Medina,  scarcely acknowledging the\n\nrefusal  to  grant  his  motion to  file  late,  attacks  the\n\ndistrict court's ruling that  the proffer was insufficient to\n\njustify an evidentiary hearing.\n\n     We  see  no reason  to  choose  between the  alternative\n\ngrounds for denial of a hearing--lateness and lack of merit--\n\n                             -7-\n\nbecause each is adequate.  The original motion was filed long\n\nafter the deadline with no explanation other than a change of\n\ncounsel.  Where  the district  court refuses to  allow a  new\n\nmotion to be  filed out of  time, the standard  on appeal  is\n\nabuse of  discretion.   E.g., United  States v.  Roberts, 978\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 17, 21  n.5 (1st Cir. 1992).  If  the district judge had\n\nrested solely  on the  lateness of  the pre-trial motion  and\n\nrefused  to  entertain a  post-trial  replicate  of the  same\n\nmotion, there would be no abuse of discretion.  Nor would the\n\ndistrict  court's  precautionary  comment  on  the  merits in\n\ndenying leave to file either remove the lateness objection or\n\nalter our standard of review.  \n\n     The result is no different if we do consider the merits.\n\nIn substance, Medina's proffer asserted  that in July 1987 an\n\nassistant U.S. attorney  advised Medina's  then counsel  that\n\nthe  government would not prosecute  Medina if he would agree\n\nto  make restitution to the  bank in the  amount of $200,000.\n\nThe proffer then concluded:  \"By the end of 1988, I  [Medina]\n\nhad paid the Bank of Boston an amount greater than $200,000.\"\n\nMedina's  affidavit was  also  the basis  for the  post-trial\n\nmotion  making the  same request  for a  hearing on  the same\n\nground.\n\n     This affidavit  does not  say that Medina  ever formally\n\naccepted  the government's offer or that  his payments to the\n\nbank were in  compliance with the  purported agreement.   Our\n\n                             -8-\n\nsense that the affidavit is the product of artful drafting is\n\nreinforced by  indications that the Bank  of Boston recovered\n\nsubstantial amounts by attaching Medina's account at  another\n\nbank.    Medina  also  made  no  effort,  as  far  as we  can\n\nascertain, to remedy the  deficiencies in his affidavit after\n\nthey were  first noted by  the district  court.   Evidentiary\n\nhearings are not  required when there  is no likely  prospect\n\nthat they will be  fruitful.  United States v.  McAndrews, 12\n                                                         \n\nF.3d 273, 280 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     The  supplementary post-trial claim that the prosecution\n\nwas based on  a vindictive motive is scarcely  worth comment.\n\nMedina's further affidavit on this  issue is both sketchy and\n\njumbled, but rests importantly on a lawsuit brought by Medina\n\nagainst  the government.   The  government pointed  out in  a\n\nmotion  to strike  Medina's  submission that  the lawsuit  in\n\nquestion was  brought after  Medina had  been indicted.   Its\n                           \n\nuntimeliness aside,  Medina's new affidavit  added little  to\n\nthe  prior  one  and provided  no  independent  basis  for an\n\nevidentiary hearing.\n\n     Several  of Medina's  merits arguments  are significant.\n\nWe  start with those that relate only to bank fraud which was\n\nthe offense  charged in  count I  of the  indictment.   As it\n\nstood  at the time Medina  deposited his check  (it has since\n\nbeen twice  amended), the statute  in pertinent part  read as\n\nfollows:\n\n                             -9-\n\n     (a) Whoever knowingly executes, or  attempts to execute,\n     a scheme or artifice -- \n\n          (1) to defraud  a federally chartered  or\n          insured financial institution or\n\n          (2) to obtain  any of the  moneys, funds,\n          credits,  assets,  securities,  or  other\n          property  owned by, or  under the custody\n          or control of,  a federally chartered  or\n          insured financial institution by means of\n          false     or    fraudulent     pretenses,\n          representations, or promises . . . .\n\n          [shall be punished  as set  forth in  the\n          statute].\n\n18 U.S.C.   1344(a).\n\n     Count  I  of  the  indictment charged  that  Medina  had\n\nexecuted or attempted to  execute a scheme both to  defraud a\n\nfederally  chartered  or  insured  bank  and  to  obtain  its\n                                            \n\nproperty by false or fraudulent representations.   Consistent\n\nwith the statutory language, the district judge told the jury\n\nthat it  could convict on count I if it found either a scheme\n\nto defraud or  a scheme to obtain property by  means of false\n             \n\nor fraudulent representations.\n\n     Medina's  first  objection  is  that   under  subsection\n\n(a)(2), two  or  more misrepresentations  are  required1  and\n\nthat here,  according to Medina, the  government charged only\n\none misrepresentation and proved none at all.  The government\n\nresponds that the evidence  was adequate to show a  scheme to\n\n                    \n\n     1This issue was left open in United States v. Lilly, 983\n                                                        \nF.2d 300, 305 n.10  (1st Cir. 1992), and we  have no occasion\nto decide it here.\n\n                             -10-\n\ndefraud under subsection  (a)(1) so that  it does not  matter\n\nwhether  misrepresentations  need  to  be  multiple  or  were\n\nadequately  proved under  subsection (a)(2).   But  here, the\n\nfalse or fraudulent representations charge was also submitted\n\nto  the jury  as an  alternative basis  for convicting  under\n\ncount  I.   Thus,  at  least in  theory, a  problem  might be\n\npresented for the government if it had charged only one false\n\nrepresentation or failed to prove any.\n\n     In  fact,  we  think  that  the government's  indictment\n\nalleged multiple representations  and the evidence  permitted\n\nthe jury to find at least two.  The indictment charged Medina\n\nwith making  false and fraudulent \"representaions\" [sic], and\n\nthe district  court charged  the jury  that \"representations\"\n\nwere  required.    Although  the indictment  also  said  that\n\nMedina's conduct involved submitting \"a  check he represented\n\nto be in the amount of  $365,000.00, knowing the check to  be\n\nin  the  true amount  of  $365.00,\" we  do not  see  why this\n\ngeneric  statement prevented the government from proving that\n\nthis representation was made more than once.\n\n     As   for    the   adequacy   of   the    evidence,   two\n\nmisrepresentations could  easily have  been found.   Medina's\n\nfirst deposit slip  said that the check was in  the amount of\n\n$365,000 when the  words on the check  said plainly, although\n\nin  Spanish, that  the amount was  $365.  When  the check was\n\nredeposited on  November 7, Medina again  submitted a deposit\n\n                             -11-\n\nslip in  the larger amount.   Medina does not  claim that the\n\ncheck  was  actually for  $365,000.    Instead  he says  that\n\nPopielski completed the second deposit slip and that there is\n\nno evidence to  show that  he (Medina) filled  out the  first\n\none.\n\n     Ample evidence  showed that it was  Medina who submitted\n\nthe check on November 3 with a deposit slip in  the amount of\n\n$365,000;  the  evidence  included  surveillance  photographs\n\nshowing  him   at  the  teller's  window   making  a  deposit\n\ntransaction  at the time stamped  on the bank  of his deposit\n\nslip.  As for the redeposit on November 7, again confirmed by\n\na surveillance  photograph of Medina at  the teller's window,\n\nit  is  irrelevant that  Popielski  wrote the  amount  on the\n\nsecond deposit slip so long as Medina knowingly presented it.\n\nThus,  there was proof of at  least two false representations\n\nby Medina, one on each presentation of the check.\n\n     Medina's second argument on count I is that the district\n\ncourt  erred  in  refusing to  instruct  the  jury  that \"the\n\ndeposit of a  check alone [is  not] a misrepresentation\"  and\n\nthat  \"[a]  check  is not  a  factual  assertion  at all  and\n\ntherefore cannot be  characterized as true or  false.\"  These\n\nrequested  statements  were  drawn  from Williams  v.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates,  458 U.S.  279 (1982),  where the  Court said  that a\n      \n\ncheck was merely an order to pay funds and did not constitute\n\nan implied representation that the one who made and deposited\n\n                             -12-\n\nit  actually had funds in the  account on which the check was\n\ndrawn.2  The  district court  refused to charge  the jury  in\n\nthis  case with the language drawn from Williams.  We believe\n                                                \n\nthat its decision was correct.\n\n     The  government in our own  case was not  relying on any\n\nimplied  representation  that  Medina had  funds  on  deposit\n\nsufficient  to  cover  the  check.   Rather,  the  government\n\ncharged that in depositing the check Medina had affirmatively\n\nmisrepresented--at least through  the deposit slips--that the\n\ncheck being deposited was one whose  face value was $365,000.\n\nWe have read both the indictment and the government's closing\n\narguments to the jury,  and conclude that there is  no chance\n\nthat the  jury misunderstood  the government's theory.   That\n\ntheory does not present the implied misrepresentation problem\n\naddressed in Williams.\n                     \n\n     Next, in  a very  brief argument, Medina  claims without\n\nexplanation that \"the only possible victim\" of  any scheme to\n\ndefraud in  the present case  would have been  Banco Central,\n\nadmittedly not  a federally chartered or insured institution.\n\nThe evidence showed the  Bank of Boston, which is  covered by\n\nthe statute,  was induced  by Medina's  misrepresentations to\n\npay out a large sum to Medina.  It is not clear  whether Bank\n\n                    \n\n     2Williams was  a  prosecution under  a false  statements\n              \nstatute  of a defendant who  deposited in his  account in one\nbank  a check--not covered by adequate funds--that he drew on\nhis account in a second bank.\n\n                             -13-\n\nof Boston might have had a claim against Banco Central or its\n\naccount   for  the  latter's   mistake  in  depicting  arabic\n\nnumerals; Banco Central, after all, had warned Bank of Boston\n\nabout the mistake before the redeposit.  But that possibility\n\ndoes not alter the fact that Bank of Boston was the immediate\n\nvictim of the fraud.\n\n     Finally, Medina makes the  interesting argument that the\n\njury might have convicted Medina without true unanimity, some\n\n(but not all) jurors  believing that he had violated  section\n\n1344(a)(1),  and  others  (but  not all)  believing  that  he\n\nviolated section 1344(a)(2).   Both the government and Medina\n\nagree  that  the  two subsections  identify  separate crimes.\n\nAccord United States  v. Bonnett, 877  F.2d 1450, 1455  (10th\n                                \n\nCir.  1989).   If so,  it follows  that Medina  could not  be\n\nconvicted of a crime  unless the jurors could all  agree that\n\nat least one of the subsections had been violated.  This same\n\nproblem  is  sometimes  presented  where a  single  crime  is\n\ndefined by several alternative acts any one of which suffices\n                              \n\nfor conviction.3  \n\n     The government  accepts that unanimity was  required but\n\ncites  us to  a \"general  rule\" that \"when  a jury  returns a\n\nguilty  verdict  on an  indictment  charging  [in one  count]\n\n                    \n\n     3Compare United States v.

But it is\n                       \n\none  thing to say that the evidence is sufficient if adequate\n                                   \n\nto  establish  any   one  of  several  acts  charged  in  the\n\nalternative; it is quite another to take the general language\n\nof  Murray  and  Turner to  foreclose  any  inquiry  into the\n                       \n\nadequacy of the instructions.\n                            \n\n     Here, the government  concedes that two  separate crimes\n\nwere created by the two subsections.  Thus, we  see no reason\n\nwhy  Medina would  not have  been entitled  on request  to an\n\ninstruction  that  the jury  had  to  agree unanimously  that\n\neither section  (a)(1) or subsection (a)(2)  was violated (or\n                         \n\nboth).   Of course, where two separate crimes are charged but\n\neach in a separate count, the problem  evaporates because the\n\njury  is told  that it  must  be unanimous  on each  count of\n\nconviction.  Here, the government charged a violation of both\n                                                             \n\nsubsections  in  a single  count,  and  Medina, probably  not\n\nwishing  to be  charged with  three counts  rather than  two,\n\napparently did not argue that count I was duplicitous.  Thus,\n\nthe  risk  of  jury  confusion cannot  be  answered  here  by\n\npointing to the normal requirement that the jury be unanimous\n\non any count of conviction.  \n\n                             -15-\n\n     The government  argues that  the district court  in this\n\ncase charged the jury that  it could find either a  scheme to\n\ndefraud  \"or\" a  scheme to  obtain monies  by means  of false\n\nrepresentations; that the government  had \"to prove each part\n\nof each offense beyond a reasonable doubt\"; and that the jury\n\nverdict must  be unanimous.   But these  instructions do  not\n       \n\nclearly tell the jury that it had to be unanimous in  finding\n\nwithin count I of  the indictment either a scheme  to defraud\n      \n\nor  a scheme based on false representations.  That is perhaps\n\nwhat  the  jury  would   have  understood,  but  it   is  not\n\ninevitable.\n\n     Still, the defense did not  ask for any clarification or\n\ninstruction  on this issue, so  reversal can be  had only for\n\nplain error.  E.g., United  States v. Arias-Santana, 964 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1262, 1268 (1st Cir.  1992).  We see no  practical likelihood\n\nthat  the  jury  could  have  divided  along  the  lines  now\n\nsuggested  by Medina.  Although  in theory we  may be talking\n\nabout two  separate crimes, in this case the evidence offered\n\nas to  count I made the  same conduct the basis  for both the\n                             \n\nfraud  and misrepresentation  branches of  count I.   Indeed,\n\nthat is probably why  the government charged both subsections\n\nin a single count.  In all events, on this evidence, the jury\n                                          \n\neither had  to believe that Medina  violated both subsections\n\nor  neither.  There was  no realistic possibility  of a split\n\nverdict of the kind now conjectured by Medina.\n\n                             -16-\n\n     If  the trial judge had been asked to clarify the point,\n\nquite likely  he would have told the jury that it had to find\n\nunanimously either a scheme  to defraud or a scheme  based on\n\nfalse  representations.  Probably he  was not asked  to do so\n\nbecause  no actual  threat  existed here  of a  non-unanimous\n\nverdict.  There was  not only no plain error but  arguably no\n\nerror  at all.  On  other facts--for example, where divergent\n\nconduct  underlay the two  branches of subsection  (a) or the\n\nsame conduct  could realistically violate one  branch but not\n\nthe other--our view might be quite different.\n\n     Medina's  next claim of error relates to count II of the\n\nindictment in  which he was charged  with having \"transmitted\n\nand transferred in  foreign commerce money  in the amount  of\n\n$350,000.00,  more or  less, knowing  the same  to have  been\n\nstolen, converted and taken by fraud . . . .\"  The statute in\n\npertinent part makes it  unlawful to \"transport in interstate\n\nor foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities\n\nor money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to\n\nhave been stolen, converted  or taken by fraud.\"  18 U.S.C.  \n\n2314.\n\n     Medina  argues on  appeal  that under  this statute  the\n\nproperty must have  been stolen  \"before being  transported.\"\n\nSee  United States v. Tashjian, 660 F.2d 829, 840 (1st Cir.),\n                              \n\ncert. denied,  454 U.S. 1102  (1981).   Here, Medina's  brief\n            \n\nsays  blandly but  without  explanation, \"no  money had  been\n\n                             -17-\n\nstolen  or taken  by  fraud at  the  time of  the  transfer.\"\n\nPossibly  what Medina  intends to  argue  is that  the bank's\n\nmoney was not stolen,  converted or taken by fraud  merely on\n\naccount  of  the  wrongful  credit  to  Medina's  account  on\n\nNovember 7 because  at that time no  money had yet  been paid\n\nout by the  bank.   Put differently, Medina  may be  claiming\n\nthat when transferred the money had not yet been stolen.\n                                           \n\n     We see no reason why the fraudulent  taking required any\n\nmore than  Medina's deposit of the check in Medina's account,\n\nthe  misrepresentations,   the availability  of the  money to\n\nhim, and  the requisite  scienter.  Popielski  testified that\n\nthe  $365,000  was  available  to Medina  for  withdrawal  on\n\nNovember  10, at least two  days before the  wire transfer to\n\nEngland.   True, the  bank could  have nullified  the deposit\n\nbefore  the  transfer,  had  it  been  more  alert; but  from\n\nNovember  10 onward the money  was just as  much available to\n\nMedina as if it were cash stored under his mattress.\n\n     Medina's final set of  arguments is directed to both  of\n\nthe counts against  him.   He starts  with a  straightforward\n\nargument  that  the  Bank  of  Boston  could  not  have  been\n\ndefrauded of its money,  nor could the money have  been taken\n\nby fraud,  since Banco Central informed Bank  of Boston prior\n\nto the  second deposit on  November 7 that the  amount of the\n\ncheck was  $365.  The  government concedes that  a defendant,\n\nwhatever his state of mind, cannot be convicted of possessing\n\n                             -18-\n\ndrugs or  stolen property if  the substance is not  in fact a\n\ncontrolled substance or the property not stolen.  E.g. United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Rose,  590 F.2d  232, 235  (7th Cir.  1978), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied,  442 U.S.  929 (1979); United  States v.  Oviedo, 525\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 881, 885-86  (5th Cir. 1976).  In such cases, of course,\n\na  change in  the  nature  of  the  property  can  defeat  an\n\nessential element of the offense.   \n\n     The government may overstate  the matter in arguing that\n\n\"[i]n  contrast the crime of bank fraud focuses on Medina and\n\nhis state of mind, and not  on the conduct of the bank.\"   It\n\nmight  be  difficult  to  defraud an  individual,  or  obtain\n\nproperty by fraud, if  the \"victim\" were well aware  that the\n\ndefendant's  statements  were untrue.    But  the analogy  is\n\nunrealistic  as applied to a large bank which happens to have\n\nthe  true  facts  somewhere  in  its  files.    There  is  no\n\nindication that Banco Central's warning was known to the bank\n\nteller who accepted the check for credit  on November 7 or to\n\nPopielski when she facilitated the deposit and authorized the\n\nwire transfer.\n\n     It  may well be that  for other purposes,  say under the\n\nUniform Commercial  Code, notice  to the bank  through proper\n\nchannels is, in some  sense and for some purposes,  notice to\n\neveryone  within the bank.   But Medina did  defraud the bank\n\nrepresentatives with whom he dealt; and money was credited to\n\nhis  account and transferred out of the bank because of their\n\n                             -19-\n\nbelief in his statements, and not  on some independent basis.\n\nIt  is  hard to  imagine any  reason  of practical  policy to\n\naccept the unitary-victim argument that Medina may be urging.\n\nAbsent compelling authority, we reject the argument.\n\n     Medina next says that the  same deposit and transfer has\n\nbeen  charged as two separate offenses  in two counts, making\n\nthe indictment  multiplicitous.   This argument rests  on the\n\nfact that in  part of  count I the  government mentioned  the\n\ntransfer  of $350,000  out  of Medina's  account.   The  same\n\ntransfer,  including a  reference to  the original  taking by\n\nfraud, is the heart of count  II of the indictment.  Although\n\nmultiplicity is  forbidden by double jeopardy principles, the\n\nuse  of the  same  evidence or  conduct  in relation  to  two\n\ndifferent counts does not itself establish multiplicity.\n\n     Even \"where  the same  act or transaction  constitutes a\n\nviolation of  two distinct statutory provisions,  the test to\n\nbe  applied to determine  whether there  are two  offenses or\n\nonly one is whether  each provision requires [as an  element]\n\nproof of a fact which the other does not.\"   United States v.\n                                                          \n\nBlockburger,  284 U.S. 299,  304 (1932).   Here, section 1344\n           \n\nrequired  proof that  a scheme  had been  executed against  a\n\nfederally  insured  bank;  section  2314  required  proof  of\n\ninterstate  or  foreign  transportation  of  stolen property.\n\nEach provision thus requires proof that the other does not.\n\n                             -20-\n\n     Medina's last  argument is that the  evidence simply did\n\nnot permit a rational jury to find him guilty on either count\n\nand, alternatively,  that the district court  should at least\n\nhave  ordered a new trial.  The  denial of a motion to direct\n\nan acquittal is reviewed de  novo, United States v. Gonzalez-\n                                                             \n\nTorres,  980 F.2d  788, 790  (1st Cir.  1992), and  the trial\n      \n\ncourt's denial of a  new trial request is reviewed  for abuse\n\nof discretion.  United  States v. Nickens, 955 F.2d  112, 116\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 108 (1992).  We need not\n                        \n\ndifferentiate  sharply,  because  in  this  case  the  jury's\n\nverdict  was neither irrational nor against the weight of the\n\nevidence.\n\n     Medina's  conduct  was   largely  undisputed,  and   the\n\ncritical  issues involved  his knowledge  and state  of mind.\n\nAbsent a confession of guilt, the government's case could not\n\nbe air-tight.   Yet there was no  proof that Medina  had ever\n\napplied  to a  Spanish ministry  for a  grant of  $365,000 or\n\nexpected such  a check from  Banco Central.   His persistence\n\nand haste in getting the money deposited into his account and\n\nthen out of the country  were at least suspicious.  The  jury\n\nmust  certainly  have  thought  that  Medina's  story  of  an\n\ninnocent mistake  was fragmented,  improbable in a  number of\n\nrespects, and ultimately did not hang together.\n\n     It is beside the point that the bank's  customer service\n\nrepresentative misread the check; there is no indication that\n\n                             -21-\n\nshe could read Spanish, as Medina could.  She also had no way\n\nof knowing whether Medina  might or might not be  expecting a\n\ncheck in this  amount.   Medina's brief states  that his  own\n\nexpert  witness thought  that  the  value  of the  check  was\n\n$365,000.   In fact, the expert, whose testimony would not in\n\nany event be binding  on the jury, testified to the  value of\n\nthe check, \"as  reflected in  that box,\" i.e.,  the box  that\n                                             \n\ncontained the mistaken arabic numerals \"$365,ooo.\"\n\n     Finally, in an attempt  to bolster his lack of  evidence\n\nclaim, Medina's brief singles  out a variety of  comments and\n\narguments  made by the prosecutor that Medina says misled the\n\njury.  It appears that none of the statements was the subject\n\nof  objection  at trial;  while one  or  two might  have been\n\nsubject to  adjustment, none is especially  troubling or even\n\nremotely  close to  plain  error.   The prosecutor's  remarks\n\nprovide  no  reason to  hesitate  in  our  appraisal  of  the\n\nevidence.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -22-\n",

Sec. 1344 and one count of transportation in foreign commerce of stolen or fraudulently obtained funds under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2314.  The gist of the events described in the indictment was that Medina had deposited a $365 check in his Bank of Boston account, knowingly misrepresented the amount as $365,000, ultimately received a credit of $365,000 to his account, and then transferred $350,000 of these fraudulently obtained funds to his account in an English bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At arraignment on October 8, 1991, the magistrate-judge ordered that pre-trial motions by the defense be filed by November 1, 1991.  On this deadline, Medina filed a number of motions that were subsequently resolved.  Medina's trial date was repeatedly delayed, largely at his own request, until January 4, 1993.  In the meantime, on November 24, 1992, following a change of counsel by Medina, his new counsel submitted five additional pre-trial motions, accompanied by a motion seeking leave to file the motions late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of these motions--with which this appeal is in part concerned--asked that the case be dismissed on the ground that it was being pursued in breach of a promise by the prosecutor made in 1987 not to prosecute if Medina made restitution to the bank of $200,000.  The government opposed the motion to file out of time.  On December 30, 1992, the district court denied the request to file motions out of time (with exceptions not here relevant), ruling that good cause had not been shown for the late filing.  The court also said that it had \"nevertheless\" examined the substantive motions to see whether an exception should be made in the interests of justice;  in giving a negative answer, the court found the assertions made in support of the motion to dismiss were insufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina was tried in January 1993.

In 1986 Medina was a research associate at a non-profit research organization in Boston then known as the Eye Research Institute.  Medina had been born and raised in Spain and was fluent in both English and Spanish.

The check was a bank check prepared by Banco Central of Spain, dated October 30, 1986, at Toledo, Spain, and was made payable to Medina.  The written designation of the amount was, in Spanish, \"Dolares USA, Trescientos Sesenta Y Cinco,\" which translates as \"three hundred and sixty-five U.S. dollars.\"   There was also an arabic-numeral expression of the amount in a small box on the right-hand side of the check:  \"USD 365,ooo.\"   The words \"First National Bank of Boston\" appear on the check, and both the government and Medina have described it as a check drawn on Banco Central's own checking account at the Bank of Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Medina deposited the check in his account on November 3, 1986, he listed the amount on the deposit slip as \"$365,000.\"   Two days later, on November 5, Medina returned to the branch and requested a customer service representative, Lisa Popielski, to wire $350,000 from Medina's checking account to an account in England.  Apart from the November 3 deposit, Medina's balance was about $3,000.  Popielski said that she needed to verify that the check had been collected and asked Medina to return the next day.  When Medina returned on November 6, Popielski told him that the $365,000 credit had been deleted from his account and the check had been returned to him by mail.  She told him to bring the check back to her if he intended to redeposit it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, November 7, Medina returned with the check and Popielski told Medina that the check had been returned for lack of his endorsement;  he then signed the back of the check, Popielski filled out a second deposit slip for him in the amount of $365,000, and Medina redeposited the check into his account.  On November 12, Medina returned to the bank and signed a wire transfer order, directing the transfer of $350,000 to an account in his name at Lloyd's Bank in Cambridge, England.  Later that morning the funds were wired to England.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When interviewed by the FBI in early December 1986, Medina admitted that he had deposited the check but explained that he thought that the check was funding from a Spanish ministry for a research grant for his work at the Eye Research Institute.  He said that he had purchased about $150,000 worth of equipment in Spain where it remained and where some of the research was to be conducted.  Medina subsequently gave to the FBI a letter from a Spanish ministry stating that a committee had agreed to propose the funding of a grant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina also submitted to the FBI a summary document prepared within the National Institutes of Health which recommended NIH approval of a research application by Medina with proposed funding of $282,286.  There was evidence at trial that this application had never been finally approved and that, if it had been funded, the Eye Research Institute and not Medina would have received the funds.  There was also some evidence, apparently disputed, that Medina had in fact purchased $138,755 in specialized equipment in Spain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial it developed that the bank had stumbled repeatedly.  The processing section of the bank had queried Banco Central about the check, and on November 6, the day before Medina had redeposited the check, Banco Central had wired that the proper amount of the check was $365.  When Medina redeposited the check on November 7, only $365 was debited against Banco Central's account, but Medina was credited with a $365,000 deposit.  An interoffice adjustment slip was prepared to reduce Medina's deposit by $364,635, but Medina's account records were not corrected until on or about November 25 when most of the money had long since been transferred to England.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Medina did not testify, his position at trial was that this was an innocent misunderstanding.  Medina did present an expert witness who was familiar with Spain and Spanish accounting who gave testimony on the differences between American and Spanish practices in the writing and punctuation of arabic numbers on large checks.  The government's position was that Medina had certainly read the written Spanish words on the check, which indisputedly represented its amount as $365, and had known that he was not entitled to $365,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 1993, the jury convicted Medina on both counts.  Thereafter, Medina filed post-trial motions renewing his request for an evidentiary hearing on the government's supposed breach of a promise not to prosecute.  In a supplemental memorandum, Medina said that new evidence showed that the government had a motive to retaliate which explained its breach of the alleged promise not to prosecute.  The court denied the motions, calling the proffer inadequate.  On September 30, 1993, the court sentenced Medina to 18 months' imprisonment and required that Medina pay fines or restitution in a total amount of $150,000.  The court stayed the sentence pending this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's initial arguments on appeal relate to his pre- and post-trial requests for a hearing on his claim that the government breached its promise not to prosecute if restitution were made.  The government says that the original pre-trial motion was submitted late, together with the request for leave to file;  leave was not granted because no adequate excuse for the delay was given;  and that should be the end of the matter.  Medina, scarcely acknowledging the refusal to grant his motion to file late, attacks the district court's ruling that the proffer was insufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no reason to choose between the alternative grounds for denial of a hearing--lateness and lack of merit--because each is adequate.  The original motion was filed long after the deadline with no explanation other than a change of counsel.  Where the district court refuses to allow a new motion to be filed out of time, the standard on appeal is abuse of discretion.  E.g., United States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 21 n. 5 (1st Cir.1992).  If the district judge had rested solely on the lateness of the pre-trial motion and refused to entertain a post-trial replicate of the same motion, there would be no abuse of discretion.  Nor would the district court's precautionary comment on the merits in denying leave to file either remove the lateness objection or alter our standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The result is no different if we do consider the merits.  In substance, Medina's proffer asserted that in July 1987 an assistant U.S. attorney advised Medina's then counsel that the government would not prosecute Medina if he would agree to make restitution to the bank in the amount of $200,000.  The proffer then concluded:  \"By the end of 1988, I [Medina] had paid the Bank of Boston an amount greater than $200,000.\"   Medina's affidavit was also the basis for the post-trial motion making the same request for a hearing on the same ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This affidavit does not say that Medina ever formally accepted the government's offer or that his payments to the bank were in compliance with the purported agreement.  Our sense that the affidavit is the product of artful drafting is reinforced by indications that the Bank of Boston recovered substantial amounts by attaching Medina's account at another bank.  Medina also made no effort, as far as we can ascertain, to remedy the deficiencies in his affidavit after they were first noted by the district court.  Evidentiary hearings are not required when there is no likely prospect that they will be fruitful.  United States v. McAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 280 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supplementary post-trial claim that the prosecution was based on a vindictive motive is scarcely worth comment.  Medina's further affidavit on this issue is both sketchy and jumbled, but rests importantly on a lawsuit brought by Medina against the government.  The government pointed out in a motion to strike Medina's submission that the lawsuit in question was brought after Medina had been indicted.  Its untimeliness aside, Medina's new affidavit added little to the prior one and provided no independent basis for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several of Medina's merits arguments are significant.  We start with those that relate only to bank fraud, which was the offense charged in count I of the indictment.  As it stood at the time Medina deposited his check (it has since been twice amended), the statute in pertinent part read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(a) Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(1) to defraud a federally chartered or insured financial institution or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a federally chartered or insured financial institution by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>[shall be punished as set forth in the statute].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I of the indictment charged that Medina had executed or attempted to execute a scheme both to defraud a federally chartered or insured bank and to obtain its property by false or fraudulent representations.  Consistent with the statutory language, the district judge told the jury that it could convict on count I if it found either a scheme to defraud or a scheme to obtain property by means of false or fraudulent representations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's first objection is that under subsection (a)(2), two or more misrepresentations are required<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that here, according to Medina, the government charged only one misrepresentation and proved none at all.  The government responds that the evidence was adequate to show a scheme to defraud under subsection (a)(1) so that it does not matter whether misrepresentations need to be multiple or were adequately proved under subsection (a)(2).  But here, the false or fraudulent representations charge was also submitted to the jury as an alternative basis for convicting under count I.  Thus, at least in theory, a problem might be presented for the government if it had charged only one false representation or failed to prove any.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, we think that the government's indictment alleged multiple representations and the evidence permitted the jury to find at least two.  The indictment charged Medina with making false and fraudulent \"representaions\" [sic], and the district court charged the jury that \"representations\" were required.  Although the indictment also said that Medina's conduct involved submitting \"a check he represented to be in the amount of $365,000.00, knowing the check to be in the true amount of $365.00,\" we do not see why this generic statement prevented the government from proving that this representation was made more than once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the adequacy of the evidence, two misrepresentations could easily have been found.  Medina's first deposit slip said that the check was in the amount of $365,000 when the words on the check said plainly, although in Spanish, that the amount was $365.  When the check was redeposited on November 7, Medina again submitted a deposit slip in the larger amount.  Medina does not claim that the check was actually for $365,000.  Instead he says that Popielski completed the second deposit slip and that there is no evidence to show that he (Medina) filled out the first one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ample evidence showed that it was Medina who submitted the check on November 3 with a deposit slip in the amount of $365,000;  the evidence included surveillance photographs showing him at the teller's window making a deposit transaction at the time stamped on the bank of his deposit slip.  As for the redeposit on November 7, again confirmed by a surveillance photograph of Medina at the teller's window, it is irrelevant that Popielski wrote the amount on the second deposit slip so long as Medina knowingly presented it.  Thus, there was proof of at least two false representations by Medina, one on each presentation of the check.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's second argument on count I is that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that \"the deposit of a check alone [is not] a misrepresentation\" and that \"[a] check is not a factual assertion at all and therefore cannot be characterized as true or false.\"   These requested statements were drawn from Williams v. United States, 458 U.S. 279, 102 S.Ct. 3088, 73 L.Ed.2d 767 (1982), where the Court said that a check was merely an order to pay funds and did not constitute an implied representation that the one who made and deposited it actually had funds in the account on which the check was drawn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court refused to charge the jury in this case with the language drawn from Williams.   We believe that its decision was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government in our own case was not relying on any implied representation that Medina had funds on deposit sufficient to cover the check.  Rather, the government charged that in depositing the check Medina had affirmatively misrepresented--at least through the deposit slips--that the check being deposited was one whose face value was $365,000.  We have read both the indictment and the government's closing arguments to the jury, and conclude that there is no chance that the jury misunderstood the government's theory.  That theory does not present the implied misrepresentation problem addressed in Williams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, in a very brief argument, Medina claims without explanation that \"the only possible victim\" of any scheme to defraud in the present case would have been Banco Central, admittedly not a federally chartered or insured institution.  The evidence showed the Bank of Boston, which is covered by the statute, was induced by Medina's misrepresentations to pay out a large sum to Medina.  It is not clear whether Bank of Boston might have had a claim against Banco Central or its account for the latter's mistake in depicting arabic numerals;  Banco Central, after all, had warned Bank of Boston about the mistake before the redeposit.  But that possibility does not alter the fact that Bank of Boston was the immediate victim of the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Medina makes the interesting argument that the jury might have convicted Medina without true unanimity, some (but not all) jurors believing that he had violated section 1344(a)(1), and others (but not all) believing that he violated section 1344(a)(2).  Both the government and Medina agree that the two subsections identify separate crimes.  Accord United States v. Bonnett, 877 F.2d 1450, 1455 (10th Cir.1989).  If so, it follows that Medina could not be convicted of a crime unless the jurors could all agree that at least one of the subsections had been violated.  This same problem is sometimes presented where a single crime is defined by several alternative acts any one of which suffices for conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government accepts that unanimity was required but cites us to a \"general rule\" that \"when a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging [in one count] several acts in the conjunctive, the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.\"  United States v. Murray, 621 F.2d 1163, 1171 n. 10 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 837, 101 S.Ct. 112, 66 L.Ed.2d 44 (1980).  See also Turner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398, 420, 90 S.Ct. 642, 654, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970).  But it is one thing to say that the evidence is sufficient if adequate to establish any one of several acts charged in the alternative;  it is quite another to take the general language of Murray and Turner to foreclose any inquiry into the adequacy of the instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government concedes that two separate crimes were created by the two subsections.  Thus, we see no reason why Medina would not have been entitled on request to an instruction that the jury had to agree unanimously that either section (a)(1) or subsection (a)(2) was violated (or both).  Of course, where two separate crimes are charged but each in a separate count, the problem evaporates because the jury is told that it must be unanimous on each count of conviction.  Here, the government charged a violation of both subsections in a single count, and Medina, probably not wishing to be charged with three counts rather than two, apparently did not argue that count I was duplicitous.  Thus, the risk of jury confusion cannot be answered here by pointing to the normal requirement that the jury be unanimous on any count of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the district court in this case charged the jury that it could find either a scheme to defraud \"or\" a scheme to obtain monies by means of false representations;  that the government had \"to prove each part of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt\";  and that the jury verdict must be unanimous.  But these instructions do not clearly tell the jury that it had to be unanimous in finding within count I of the indictment either a scheme to defraud or a scheme based on false representations.  That is perhaps what the jury would have understood, but it is not inevitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, the defense did not ask for any clarification or instruction on this issue, so reversal can be had only for plain error.  E.g., United States v. Arias-Santana, 964 F.2d 1262, 1268 (1st Cir.1992).  We see no practical likelihood that the jury could have divided along the lines now suggested by Medina.  Although in theory we may be talking about two separate crimes, in this case the evidence offered as to count I made the same conduct the basis for both the fraud and misrepresentation branches of count I.  Indeed, that is probably why the government charged both subsections in a single count.  In all events, on this evidence, the jury either had to believe that Medina violated both subsections or neither.  There was no realistic possibility of a split verdict of the kind now conjectured by Medina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the trial judge had been asked to clarify the point, quite likely he would have told the jury that it had to find unanimously either a scheme to defraud or a scheme based on false representations.  Probably he was not asked to do so because no actual threat existed here of a non-unanimous verdict.  There was not only no plain error but arguably no error at all.  On other facts--for example, where divergent conduct underlay the two branches of subsection (a) or the same conduct could realistically violate one branch but not the other--our view might be quite different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's next claim of error relates to count II of the indictment in which he was charged with having \"transmitted and transferred in foreign commerce money in the amount of $350,000.00, more or less, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted and taken by fraud....\"  The statute in pertinent part makes it unlawful to \"transport in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 2314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina argues on appeal that under this statute the property must have been stolen \"before being transported.\"   See United States v. Tashjian, 660 F.2d 829, 840 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1102, 102 S.Ct. 681, 70 L.Ed.2d 646 (1981).  Here, Medina's brief says blandly but without explanation, \"no money had been stolen or taken by fraud at the time of the transfer.\"   Possibly what Medina intends to argue is that the bank's money was not stolen, converted or taken by fraud merely on account of the wrongful credit to Medina's account on November 7 because at that time no money had yet been paid out by the bank.  Put differently, Medina may be claiming that when transferred the money had not yet been stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no reason why the fraudulent taking required any more than Medina's deposit of the check in Medina's account, the misrepresentations, the availability of the money to him, and the requisite scienter.  Popielski testified that the $365,000 was available to Medina for withdrawal on November 10, at least two days before the wire transfer to England.  True, the bank could have nullified the deposit before the transfer, had it been more alert;  but from November 10 onward the money was just as much available to Medina as if it were cash stored under his mattress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's final set of arguments is directed to both of the counts against him.  He starts with a straightforward argument that the Bank of Boston could not have been defrauded of its money, nor could the money have been taken by fraud, since Banco Central informed Bank of Boston prior to the second deposit on November 7 that the amount of the check was $365.  The government concedes that a defendant, whatever his state of mind, cannot be convicted of possessing drugs or stolen property if the substance is not in fact a controlled substance or the property not stolen.  E.g. United States v. Rose, 590 F.2d 232, 235 (7th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S.Ct. 2859, 61 L.Ed.2d 297 (1979);  United States v. Oviedo, 525 F.2d 881, 885-86 (5th Cir.1976).  In such cases, of course, a change in the nature of the property can defeat an essential element of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government may overstate the matter in arguing that \"[i]n contrast the crime of bank fraud focuses on Medina and his state of mind, and not on the conduct of the bank.\"   It might be difficult to defraud an individual, or obtain property by fraud, if the \"victim\" were well aware that the defendant's statements were untrue.  But the analogy is unrealistic as applied to a large bank which happens to have the true facts somewhere in its files.  There is no indication that Banco Central's warning was known to the bank teller who accepted the check for credit on November 7 or to Popielski when she facilitated the deposit and authorized the wire transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may well be that for other purposes, say under the Uniform Commercial Code, notice to the bank through proper channels is, in some sense and for some purposes, notice to everyone within the bank.  But Medina did defraud the bank representatives with whom he dealt;  and money was credited to his account and transferred out of the bank because of their belief in his statements, and not on some independent basis.  It is hard to imagine any reason of practical policy to accept the unitary-victim argument that Medina may be urging.  Absent compelling authority, we reject the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina next says that the same deposit and transfer has been charged as two separate offenses in two counts, making the indictment multiplicitous.  This argument rests on the fact that in part of count I the government mentioned the transfer of $350,000 out of Medina's account.  The same transfer, including a reference to the original taking by fraud, is the heart of count II of the indictment.  Although multiplicity is forbidden by double jeopardy principles, the use of the same evidence or conduct in relation to two different counts does not itself establish multiplicity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires [as an element] proof of a fact which the other does not.\"  Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).  Here, section 1344 required proof that a scheme had been executed against a federally insured bank;  section 2314 required proof of interstate or foreign transportation of stolen property.  Each provision thus requires proof that the other does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's last argument is that the evidence simply did not permit a rational jury to find him guilty on either count and, alternatively, that the district court should at least have ordered a new trial.  The denial of a motion to direct an acquittal is reviewed de novo, United States v.

We need not differentiate sharply, because in this case the jury's verdict was neither irrational nor against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's conduct was largely undisputed, and the critical issues involved his knowledge and state of mind.  Absent a confession of guilt, the government's case could not be airtight.  Yet there was no proof that Medina had ever applied to a Spanish ministry for a grant of $365,000 or expected such a check from Banco Central.  His persistence and haste in getting the money deposited into his account and then out of the country were at least suspicious.  The jury must certainly have thought that Medina's story of an innocent mistake was fragmented, improbable in a number of respects, and ultimately did not hang together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beside the point that the bank's customer service representative misread the check;  there is no indication that she could read Spanish, as Medina could.  She also had no way of knowing whether Medina might or might not be expecting a check in this amount.  Medina's brief states that his own expert witness thought that the value of the check was $365,000.  In fact, the expert, whose testimony would not in any event be binding on the jury, testified to the value of the check, \"as reflected in that box,\" i.e., the box that contained the mistaken arabic numerals \"$365,ooo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in an attempt to bolster his lack of evidence claim, Medina's brief singles out a variety of comments and arguments made by the prosecutor that Medina says misled the jury.  It appears that none of the statements was the subject of objection at trial;  while one or two might have been subject to adjustment, none is especially troubling or even remotely close to plain error.  The prosecutor's remarks provide no reason to hesitate in our appraisal of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This issue was left open in United States v.

Sec. 1344 and one count of transportation in foreign commerce of stolen or fraudulently obtained funds under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2314.  The gist of the events described in the indictment was that Medina had deposited a $365 check in his Bank of Boston account, knowingly misrepresented the amount as $365,000, ultimately received a credit of $365,000 to his account, and then transferred $350,000 of these fraudulently obtained funds to his account in an English bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At arraignment on October 8, 1991, the magistrate-judge ordered that pre-trial motions by the defense be filed by November 1, 1991.  On this deadline, Medina filed a number of motions that were subsequently resolved.  Medina's trial date was repeatedly delayed, largely at his own request, until January 4, 1993.  In the meantime, on November 24, 1992, following a change of counsel by Medina, his new counsel submitted five additional pre-trial motions, accompanied by a motion seeking leave to file the motions late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of these motions--with which this appeal is in part concerned--asked that the case be dismissed on the ground that it was being pursued in breach of a promise by the prosecutor made in 1987 not to prosecute if Medina made restitution to the bank of $200,000.  The government opposed the motion to file out of time.  On December 30, 1992, the district court denied the request to file motions out of time (with exceptions not here relevant), ruling that good cause had not been shown for the late filing.  The court also said that it had \"nevertheless\" examined the substantive motions to see whether an exception should be made in the interests of justice;  in giving a negative answer, the court found the assertions made in support of the motion to dismiss were insufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina was tried in January 1993.

In 1986 Medina was a research associate at a non-profit research organization in Boston then known as the Eye Research Institute.  Medina had been born and raised in Spain and was fluent in both English and Spanish.  He had Spanish graduate degrees in optics and engineering and a graduate degree in electrical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 3, 1986, Medina deposited a check in his account in that branch of the Bank of Boston where he did most of his banking.  The check was a bank check prepared by Banco Central of Spain, dated October 30, 1986, at Toledo, Spain, and was made payable to Medina.  The written designation of the amount was, in Spanish, \"Dolares USA, Trescientos Sesenta Y Cinco,\" which translates as \"three hundred and sixty-five U.S. dollars.\"   There was also an arabic-numeral expression of the amount in a small box on the right-hand side of the check:  \"USD 365,ooo.\"   The words \"First National Bank of Boston\" appear on the check, and both the government and Medina have described it as a check drawn on Banco Central's own checking account at the Bank of Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Medina deposited the check in his account on November 3, 1986, he listed the amount on the deposit slip as \"$365,000.\"   Two days later, on November 5, Medina returned to the branch and requested a customer service representative, Lisa Popielski, to wire $350,000 from Medina's checking account to an account in England.  Apart from the November 3 deposit, Medina's balance was about $3,000.  Popielski said that she needed to verify that the check had been collected and asked Medina to return the next day.  When Medina returned on November 6, Popielski told him that the $365,000 credit had been deleted from his account and the check had been returned to him by mail.  She told him to bring the check back to her if he intended to redeposit it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, November 7, Medina returned with the check and Popielski told Medina that the check had been returned for lack of his endorsement;  he then signed the back of the check, Popielski filled out a second deposit slip for him in the amount of $365,000, and Medina redeposited the check into his account.  On November 12, Medina returned to the bank and signed a wire transfer order, directing the transfer of $350,000 to an account in his name at Lloyd's Bank in Cambridge, England.  Later that morning the funds were wired to England.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When interviewed by the FBI in early December 1986, Medina admitted that he had deposited the check but explained that he thought that the check was funding from a Spanish ministry for a research grant for his work at the Eye Research Institute.  He said that he had purchased about $150,000 worth of equipment in Spain where it remained and where some of the research was to be conducted.  Medina subsequently gave to the FBI a letter from a Spanish ministry stating that a committee had agreed to propose the funding of a grant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina also submitted to the FBI a summary document prepared within the National Institutes of Health which recommended NIH approval of a research application by Medina with proposed funding of $282,286.  There was evidence at trial that this application had never been finally approved and that, if it had been funded, the Eye Research Institute and not Medina would have received the funds.  There was also some evidence, apparently disputed, that Medina had in fact purchased $138,755 in specialized equipment in Spain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial it developed that the bank had stumbled repeatedly.  The processing section of the bank had queried Banco Central about the check, and on November 6, the day before Medina had redeposited the check, Banco Central had wired that the proper amount of the check was $365.  When Medina redeposited the check on November 7, only $365 was debited against Banco Central's account, but Medina was credited with a $365,000 deposit.  An interoffice adjustment slip was prepared to reduce Medina's deposit by $364,635, but Medina's account records were not corrected until on or about November 25 when most of the money had long since been transferred to England.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Medina did not testify, his position at trial was that this was an innocent misunderstanding.  Medina did present an expert witness who was familiar with Spain and Spanish accounting who gave testimony on the differences between American and Spanish practices in the writing and punctuation of arabic numbers on large checks.  The government's position was that Medina had certainly read the written Spanish words on the check, which indisputedly represented its amount as $365, and had known that he was not entitled to $365,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 1993, the jury convicted Medina on both counts.  Thereafter, Medina filed post-trial motions renewing his request for an evidentiary hearing on the government's supposed breach of a promise not to prosecute.  In a supplemental memorandum, Medina said that new evidence showed that the government had a motive to retaliate which explained its breach of the alleged promise not to prosecute.  The court denied the motions, calling the proffer inadequate.  On September 30, 1993, the court sentenced Medina to 18 months' imprisonment and required that Medina pay fines or restitution in a total amount of $150,000.  The court stayed the sentence pending this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's initial arguments on appeal relate to his pre- and post-trial requests for a hearing on his claim that the government breached its promise not to prosecute if restitution were made.  The government says that the original pre-trial motion was submitted late, together with the request for leave to file;  leave was not granted because no adequate excuse for the delay was given;  and that should be the end of the matter.  Medina, scarcely acknowledging the refusal to grant his motion to file late, attacks the district court's ruling that the proffer was insufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no reason to choose between the alternative grounds for denial of a hearing--lateness and lack of merit--because each is adequate.  The original motion was filed long after the deadline with no explanation other than a change of counsel.  Where the district court refuses to allow a new motion to be filed out of time, the standard on appeal is abuse of discretion.  E.g., United States v. Roberts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593292\"><a href=\"/opinion/593292/united-states-v-leslie-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 n. 5 (1st Cir.1992).  If the district judge had rested solely on the lateness of the pre-trial motion and refused to entertain a post-trial replicate of the same motion, there would be no abuse of discretion.  Nor would the district court's precautionary comment on the merits in denying leave to file either remove the lateness objection or alter our standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The result is no different if we do consider the merits.  In substance, Medina's proffer asserted that in July 1987 an assistant U.S. attorney advised Medina's then counsel that the government would not prosecute Medina if he would agree to make restitution to the bank in the amount of $200,000.  The proffer then concluded:  \"By the end of 1988, I [Medina] had paid the Bank of Boston an amount greater than $200,000.\"   Medina's affidavit was also the basis for the post-trial motion making the same request for a hearing on the same ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This affidavit does not say that Medina ever formally accepted the government's offer or that his payments to the bank were in compliance with the purported agreement.  Our sense that the affidavit is the product of artful drafting is reinforced by indications that the Bank of Boston recovered substantial amounts by attaching Medina's account at another bank.  Medina also made no effort, as far as we can ascertain, to remedy the deficiencies in his affidavit after they were first noted by the district court.  Evidentiary hearings are not required when there is no likely prospect that they will be fruitful.  United States v. McAndrews, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195084\"><a href=\"/opinion/195084/united-states-v-mcandrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 280 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supplementary post-trial claim that the prosecution was based on a vindictive motive is scarcely worth comment.  Medina's further affidavit on this issue is both sketchy and jumbled, but rests importantly on a lawsuit brought by Medina against the government.  The government pointed out in a motion to strike Medina's submission that the lawsuit in question was brought after Medina had been indicted.  Its untimeliness aside, Medina's new affidavit added little to the prior one and provided no independent basis for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several of Medina's merits arguments are significant.  We start with those that relate only to bank fraud, which was the offense charged in count I of the indictment.  As it stood at the time Medina deposited his check (it has since been twice amended), the statute in pertinent part read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(a) Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(1) to defraud a federally chartered or insured financial institution or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a federally chartered or insured financial institution by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>[shall be punished as set forth in the statute].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I of the indictment charged that Medina had executed or attempted to execute a scheme both to defraud a federally chartered or insured bank and to obtain its property by false or fraudulent representations.  Consistent with the statutory language, the district judge told the jury that it could convict on count I if it found either a scheme to defraud or a scheme to obtain property by means of false or fraudulent representations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's first objection is that under subsection (a)(2), two or more misrepresentations are required<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that here, according to Medina, the government charged only one misrepresentation and proved none at all.  The government responds that the evidence was adequate to show a scheme to defraud under subsection (a)(1) so that it does not matter whether misrepresentations need to be multiple or were adequately proved under subsection (a)(2).  But here, the false or fraudulent representations charge was also submitted to the jury as an alternative basis for convicting under count I.  Thus, at least in theory, a problem might be presented for the government if it had charged only one false representation or failed to prove any.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, we think that the government's indictment alleged multiple representations and the evidence permitted the jury to find at least two.  The indictment charged Medina with making false and fraudulent \"representaions\" [sic], and the district court charged the jury that \"representations\" were required.  Although the indictment also said that Medina's conduct involved submitting \"a check he represented to be in the amount of $365,000.00, knowing the check to be in the true amount of $365.00,\" we do not see why this generic statement prevented the government from proving that this representation was made more than once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the adequacy of the evidence, two misrepresentations could easily have been found.  Medina's first deposit slip said that the check was in the amount of $365,000 when the words on the check said plainly, although in Spanish, that the amount was $365.  When the check was redeposited on November 7, Medina again submitted a deposit slip in the larger amount.  Medina does not claim that the check was actually for $365,000.  Instead he says that Popielski completed the second deposit slip and that there is no evidence to show that he (Medina) filled out the first one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ample evidence showed that it was Medina who submitted the check on November 3 with a deposit slip in the amount of $365,000;  the evidence included surveillance photographs showing him at the teller's window making a deposit transaction at the time stamped on the bank of his deposit slip.  As for the redeposit on November 7, again confirmed by a surveillance photograph of Medina at the teller's window, it is irrelevant that Popielski wrote the amount on the second deposit slip so long as Medina knowingly presented it.  Thus, there was proof of at least two false representations by Medina, one on each presentation of the check.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's second argument on count I is that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that \"the deposit of a check alone [is not] a misrepresentation\" and that \"[a] check is not a factual assertion at all and therefore cannot be characterized as true or false.\"   These requested statements were drawn from Williams v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110779\"><a href=\"/opinion/110779/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110779\"><a href=\"/opinion/110779/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span> </a></span>(1982), where the Court said that a check was merely an order to pay funds and did not constitute an implied representation that the one who made and deposited it actually had funds in the account on which the check was drawn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court refused to charge the jury in this case with the language drawn from Williams.   We believe that its decision was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government in our own case was not relying on any implied representation that Medina had funds on deposit sufficient to cover the check.  Rather, the government charged that in depositing the check Medina had affirmatively misrepresented--at least through the deposit slips--that the check being deposited was one whose face value was $365,000.  We have read both the indictment and the government's closing arguments to the jury, and conclude that there is no chance that the jury misunderstood the government's theory.  That theory does not present the implied misrepresentation problem addressed in Williams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, in a very brief argument, Medina claims without explanation that \"the only possible victim\" of any scheme to defraud in the present case would have been Banco Central, admittedly not a federally chartered or insured institution.  The evidence showed the Bank of Boston, which is covered by the statute, was induced by Medina's misrepresentations to pay out a large sum to Medina.  It is not clear whether Bank of Boston might have had a claim against Banco Central or its account for the latter's mistake in depicting arabic numerals;  Banco Central, after all, had warned Bank of Boston about the mistake before the redeposit.  But that possibility does not alter the fact that Bank of Boston was the immediate victim of the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Medina makes the interesting argument that the jury might have convicted Medina without true unanimity, some (but not all) jurors believing that he had violated section 1344(a)(1), and others (but not all) believing that he violated section 1344(a)(2).  Both the government and Medina agree that the two subsections identify separate crimes.  Accord United States v. Bonnett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525253\"><a href=\"/opinion/525253/united-states-v-bruce-bonnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></a></span>, 1455 (10th Cir.1989).  If so, it follows that Medina could not be convicted of a crime unless the jurors could all agree that at least one of the subsections had been violated.  This same problem is sometimes presented where a single crime is defined by several alternative acts any one of which suffices for conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government accepts that unanimity was required but cites us to a \"general rule\" that \"when a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging [in one count] several acts in the conjunctive, the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.\"  United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span> </a></span>(1970).  But it is one thing to say that the evidence is sufficient if adequate to establish any one of several acts charged in the alternative;  it is quite another to take the general language of Murray and Turner to foreclose any inquiry into the adequacy of the instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government concedes that two separate crimes were created by the two subsections.  Thus, we see no reason why Medina would not have been entitled on request to an instruction that the jury had to agree unanimously that either section (a)(1) or subsection (a)(2) was violated (or both).  Of course, where two separate crimes are charged but each in a separate count, the problem evaporates because the jury is told that it must be unanimous on each count of conviction.  Here, the government charged a violation of both subsections in a single count, and Medina, probably not wishing to be charged with three counts rather than two, apparently did not argue that count I was duplicitous.  Thus, the risk of jury confusion cannot be answered here by pointing to the normal requirement that the jury be unanimous on any count of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the district court in this case charged the jury that it could find either a scheme to defraud \"or\" a scheme to obtain monies by means of false representations;  that the government had \"to prove each part of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt\";  and that the jury verdict must be unanimous.  But these instructions do not clearly tell the jury that it had to be unanimous in finding within count I of the indictment either a scheme to defraud or a scheme based on false representations.  That is perhaps what the jury would have understood, but it is not inevitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, the defense did not ask for any clarification or instruction on this issue, so reversal can be had only for plain error.  E.g., United States v. Arias-Santana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583866\"><a href=\"/opinion/583866/united-states-v-julio-ernesto-arias-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></a></span>, 1268 (1st Cir.1992).  We see no practical likelihood that the jury could have divided along the lines now suggested by Medina.  Although in theory we may be talking about two separate crimes, in this case the evidence offered as to count I made the same conduct the basis for both the fraud and misrepresentation branches of count I.  Indeed, that is probably why the government charged both subsections in a single count.  In all events, on this evidence, the jury either had to believe that Medina violated both subsections or neither.  There was no realistic possibility of a split verdict of the kind now conjectured by Medina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the trial judge had been asked to clarify the point, quite likely he would have told the jury that it had to find unanimously either a scheme to defraud or a scheme based on false representations.  Probably he was not asked to do so because no actual threat existed here of a non-unanimous verdict.  There was not only no plain error but arguably no error at all.  On other facts--for example, where divergent conduct underlay the two branches of subsection (a) or the same conduct could realistically violate one branch but not the other--our view might be quite different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's next claim of error relates to count II of the indictment in which he was charged with having \"transmitted and transferred in foreign commerce money in the amount of $350,000.00, more or less, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted and taken by fraud....\"  The statute in pertinent part makes it unlawful to \"transport in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 2314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina argues on appeal that under this statute the property must have been stolen \"before being transported.\"   See United States v. Tashjian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"395176\"><a href=\"/opinion/395176/united-states-v-charles-tashjian-united-states-of-america-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span>, 840 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span> </span>(1981).  Here, Medina's brief says blandly but without explanation, \"no money had been stolen or taken by fraud at the time of the transfer.\"   Possibly what Medina intends to argue is that the bank's money was not stolen, converted or taken by fraud merely on account of the wrongful credit to Medina's account on November 7 because at that time no money had yet been paid out by the bank.  Put differently, Medina may be claiming that when transferred the money had not yet been stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no reason why the fraudulent taking required any more than Medina's deposit of the check in Medina's account, the misrepresentations, the availability of the money to him, and the requisite scienter.  Popielski testified that the $365,000 was available to Medina for withdrawal on November 10, at least two days before the wire transfer to England.  True, the bank could have nullified the deposit before the transfer, had it been more alert;  but from November 10 onward the money was just as much available to Medina as if it were cash stored under his mattress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's final set of arguments is directed to both of the counts against him.  He starts with a straightforward argument that the Bank of Boston could not have been defrauded of its money, nor could the money have been taken by fraud, since Banco Central informed Bank of Boston prior to the second deposit on November 7 that the amount of the check was $365.  The government concedes that a defendant, whatever his state of mind, cannot be convicted of possessing drugs or stolen property if the substance is not in fact a controlled substance or the property not stolen.  E.g. United States v. Rose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362534\"><a href=\"/opinion/362534/united-states-v-william-rose-and-robert-peterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 235 (7th Cir.1978), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2859</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span> </span>(1979);  United States v. Oviedo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"331274\"><a href=\"/opinion/331274/united-states-v-martin-molina-oviedo-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span>, 885-86 (5th Cir.1976).  In such cases, of course, a change in the nature of the property can defeat an essential element of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government may overstate the matter in arguing that \"[i]n contrast the crime of bank fraud focuses on Medina and his state of mind, and not on the conduct of the bank.\"   It might be difficult to defraud an individual, or obtain property by fraud, if the \"victim\" were well aware that the defendant's statements were untrue.  But the analogy is unrealistic as applied to a large bank which happens to have the true facts somewhere in its files.  There is no indication that Banco Central's warning was known to the bank teller who accepted the check for credit on November 7 or to Popielski when she facilitated the deposit and authorized the wire transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may well be that for other purposes, say under the Uniform Commercial Code, notice to the bank through proper channels is, in some sense and for some purposes, notice to everyone within the bank.  But Medina did defraud the bank representatives with whom he dealt;  and money was credited to his account and transferred out of the bank because of their belief in his statements, and not on some independent basis.  It is hard to imagine any reason of practical policy to accept the unitary-victim argument that Medina may be urging.  Absent compelling authority, we reject the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina next says that the same deposit and transfer has been charged as two separate offenses in two counts, making the indictment multiplicitous.  This argument rests on the fact that in part of count I the government mentioned the transfer of $350,000 out of Medina's account.  The same transfer, including a reference to the original taking by fraud, is the heart of count II of the indictment.  Although multiplicity is forbidden by double jeopardy principles, the use of the same evidence or conduct in relation to two different counts does not itself establish multiplicity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires [as an element] proof of a fact which the other does not.\"  Blockburger v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span>, 304, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span>, 182, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span> </span>(1932).  Here, section 1344 required proof that a scheme had been executed against a federally insured bank;  section 2314 required proof of interstate or foreign transportation of stolen property.  Each provision thus requires proof that the other does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's last argument is that the evidence simply did not permit a rational jury to find him guilty on either count and, alternatively, that the district court should at least have ordered a new trial.  The denial of a motion to direct an acquittal is reviewed de novo, United States v. Gonzalez-Torres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596102\"><a href=\"/opinion/596102/united-states-v-claudio-gonzalez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 790 (1st Cir.1992), and the trial court's denial of a new trial request is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Nickens, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577009\"><a href=\"/opinion/577009/united-states-v-david-lloyd-nickens/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 116 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span> </span>(1992).  We need not differentiate sharply, because in this case the jury's verdict was neither irrational nor against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's conduct was largely undisputed, and the critical issues involved his knowledge and state of mind.  Absent a confession of guilt, the government's case could not be airtight.  Yet there was no proof that Medina had ever applied to a Spanish ministry for a grant of $365,000 or expected such a check from Banco Central.  His persistence and haste in getting the money deposited into his account and then out of the country were at least suspicious.  The jury must certainly have thought that Medina's story of an innocent mistake was fragmented, improbable in a number of respects, and ultimately did not hang together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beside the point that the bank's customer service representative misread the check;  there is no indication that she could read Spanish, as Medina could.  She also had no way of knowing whether Medina might or might not be expecting a check in this amount.  Medina's brief states that his own expert witness thought that the value of the check was $365,000.  In fact, the expert, whose testimony would not in any event be binding on the jury, testified to the value of the check, \"as reflected in that box,\" i.e., the box that contained the mistaken arabic numerals \"$365,ooo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in an attempt to bolster his lack of evidence claim, Medina's brief singles out a variety of comments and arguments made by the prosecutor that Medina says misled the jury.  It appears that none of the statements was the subject of objection at trial;  while one or two might have been subject to adjustment, none is especially troubling or even remotely close to plain error.  The prosecutor's remarks provide no reason to hesitate in our appraisal of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This issue was left open in United States v.
