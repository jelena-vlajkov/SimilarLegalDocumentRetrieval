Appellant pled guilty to violation  of\r                                \r\n\n31  U.S.C.       5316  and  5322,   failing  to  report   the\r\n\ntransportation of more than $10,000 in United States currency\r\n\nfrom  the United  States.   At  the  sentencing hearing,  the\r\n\ndistrict court reviewed  the plea  agreement with  appellant,\r\n\nand appellant indicated  that he understood the terms  of the\r\n\nagreement as well  as the maximum penalties  for the offense.\r\n\nHe now argues that  the $500.00 fine imposed by  the district\r\n\ncourt was excessive and violates the \"Excessive Fines Clause\"\r\n\nof the Eighth Amendment.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                           \r\n\n          The agreed-to facts, as reflected in the \"Plea  and\r\n\nForfeiture Agreement,\"    indicate that  appellant, about  to\r\n\nboard  an  airplane  from  Puerto  Rico  to  Santo   Domingo,\r\n\nDominican  Republic,  was  selected  for  interview  by  U.S.\r\n\nCustoms  agents.     Appellant  was  asked   whether  he  was\r\n\ntransporting over  $10,000.00 in U.S. currency.   He answered\r\n\nthat he was  transporting only  $1,200.00.  A  search of  his\r\n\nbags revealed $25,258.00.\r\n\n          Appellant agreed to plead guilty1 and  indicated on\r\n\nthe plea  agreement his  understanding  of the  penalties  he\r\n\nfaced -- a term of imprisonment  of not more than five years,\r\n\na  fine  of  up to  $250,000.00,  and  a  three-year term  of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.    As part of the plea agreement, the Government agreed to\r\nrequest  the dismissal of Count  Two of the Indictment, which\r\ncharged appellant with knowingly  making a false statement in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   1001.  \r\r\n\nsupervised  release.    He agreed,  too,  to  forfeit to  the\r\n\nGovernment  25  percent  of   the  $25,258.00  he  was  found\r\n\ntransporting  ($6,315.00)  and  to  pay  a  special  monetary\r\n\nassessment  of  $50.00.     Finally,  he  indicated  that  he\r\n\nunderstood  that  the  court  was   not  bound  by  the  plea\r\n\nagreement.\r\n\n          At  the  sentencing  hearing,  the  district  court\r\n\nreviewed   the   plea  agreement   with  appellant.     After\r\n\nsatisfactory response,  the  court sentenced  appellant to  a\r\n\nthree-year term of probation, and ordered  a fine of $500.00,\r\n\na $50.00 special monetary assessment, and the above-described\r\n\nforfeiture.2    Appellant  paid  the  fine  and  the  special\r\n\nassessment within a week of the sentencing hearing.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                           \r\n\n          Appellant claims that the  fine imposed in his case\r\n\nviolates   the  \"Excessive  Fines   Clause\"  of   the  Eighth\r\n\nAmendment.   He  does not  argue that  the court  was without\r\n\nstatutory power to impose the fine, that he is unable to  pay\r\n\nthe  fine, or  that  there are  any  double jeopardy  or  due\r\n\nprocess  implications.  His legal challenge to the fine boils\r\n\ndown to this:   since he is already forfeiting  a substantial\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.    Under the relevant sentencing guidelines, appellant had\r\nan  offense level of 8.  At  this level, the court could have\r\nimposed a term  of 0 to 6 months' imprisonment  and a fine of\r\n$1,000.00 to $10,000.00.  U.S.S.G. Ch. 5 Pt.A;   5E1.2(c)(3).\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\namount of money  to expiate his  wrongdoing, the addition  of\r\n\nanother $500.00 is excessive.\r\n\n          A party bringing an Eighth Amendment excessive fine\r\n\nclaim must  show, after a \"threshold  comparison\" between the\r\n\ngravity of criminal conduct and  the severity of the penalty,\r\n\nan \"initial  inference of gross disproportionality.\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

We  can  perceive   no\r                  \r\n\ndisproportionality or unfairness here.   Cf. United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nPilgrim  Market  Corp.,  944 F.2d  14,  22  (1st Cir.  1991).\r                                  \r\n\nAppellant  has no quarrel with  the forfeiture of  25% of the\r\n\nunreported funds, but only with the imposition of the $500.00\r\n\nfine.   That additional3 sum, considered  even in conjunction\r\n\nwith the forfeited  amount, was well below  the statutory and\r\n\nguideline maximums and did not transgress the Excessive Fines\r\n\nClause.\r\n\n          The judgment is affirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.    There was  never any promise or understanding  that the\r\nappellant's total  exposure was 25  percent of the  amount at\r                             \r\nissue, or  $6,315.00, compare   United States v.

He agreed, too, to forfeit to the Government 2 percent of the $25,258.00 he was found transporting ($6,315.00) and to pay a special monetary assessment of $50.00.  Finally, he indicated that he understood that the court was not bound by the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court reviewed the plea agreement with appellant.  After satisfactory response, the court sentenced appellant to a three-year term of probation, and ordered a fine of $500.00, a $50.00 special monetary assessment, and the above-described forfeiture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Appellant paid the fine and the special assessment within a week of the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant claims that the fine imposed in his case violates the \"Excessive Fines Clause\" of the Eighth Amendment.  He does not argue that the court was without statutory power to impose the fine, that he is unable to pay the fine, or that there are any double jeopardy or due process implications.  His legal challenge to the fine boils down to this:  since he is already forfeiting a substantial amount of money to expiate his wrongdoing, the addition of another $500.00 is excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party bringing an Eighth Amendment excessive fine claim must show, after a \"threshold comparison\" between the gravity of criminal conduct and the severity of the penalty, an \"initial inference of gross disproportionality.\"  United States v.
