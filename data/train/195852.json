These cross appeals require us\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \n\nto  decide  whether  the reporters,  editors,  and  photographers\n\nemployed  by a  small  community newspaper  are  exempt from  the\n\novertime and recordkeeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards\n\nAct of 1938,  29 U.S.C.   201 et seq. (\"FLSA\" or the \"Act\").  The\n\ncase revolves  around whether the  employees at issue  are exempt\n\nunder the \"professional employee\" exemption of    13(a)(1) of the\n\nAct.\n\n          This  case arose  when the  United States  Secretary of\n\nLabor (\"the Secretary\") brought this action against Newspapers of\n\nNew England, Inc. d/b/a The  Concord Monitor (\"The Monitor\"), and\r                                                                    \n\nGeorge  Wilson,  the  newspaper's  publisher,  claiming  that The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor   had  willfully   violated  the  overtime   and  records\r                 \n\nrequirements  of the FLSA  with respect to the  wages it had paid\n\nits reporters, editors, and photographers.  The Monitor's primary\r                                                                 \n\ndefense was that  the FLSA did not cover its  actions because the\n\nemployees at issue  were exempt professionals.  The  Monitor also\r                                                                      \n\nmaintained that  any FLSA violations  it may have  committed were\n\nnot willful.\n\n          The case was tried to the bench.  In an  opinion issued\n\nseven years after the  trial concluded, the court found  that The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor's   newsroom  employees   were   not   entitled  to   the\r                 \n\nprofessional exemption  from the Act's overtime  requirements and\n\nawarded back  wages and  liquidated damages to  twelve employees.\n\nThe court also found,  however, that the violations had  not been\n\ncommitted willfully  and consequently limited the  damages to the\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ntwo-year period before  the filing  of the suit  rather than  the\n\nthree-year period  applicable to  willful violations.   The court\n\nrefused to award damages for violations occurring after the close\n\nof  the  DOL's  compliance   investigation,  and  it  denied  the\n\nSecretary's  request for  a  permanent injunction  against future\n\nviolations.  These cross appeals followed.\n\n          Although the  district court  was inexplicably slow  in\n\nissuing  its  less-than-meticulous  opinion, we  affirm  for  the\n\nreasons that follow.\n\n                        FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r                                  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          The  Monitor is  an award-winning  small-city newspaper\r                                \n\nwith a  daily  circulation in  excess  of 4,000  copies.   It  is\n\npublished in  Concord, New  Hampshire, by the  defendants, George\n\nWilson  and Newspapers  of  New  England,  Inc.    In  1974,  the\n\nDepartment of Labor (\"DOL\")  investigated the newspaper under the\n\nFLSA  and  warned  it  of  possible  overtime  and  recordkeeping\n\nviolations.  Although the DOL did not press charges at that time,\n\nit informed the paper of the relevant FLSA requirements.\n\n          In late 1979 and early 1980, the DOL again investigated\n\nthe pay practices in The  Monitor's newsroom.  This investigation\r                                           \n\nconvinced the DOL that certain newsroom employees were  not being\n\npaid  for  all their  overtime  hours.    Consequently,  the  DOL\n\ncommenced  this litigation.   The newsroom employees  at issue in\n\nthe  Secretary's  action were  reporters, low-level  editors, and\n\nphotographers.\n\n          The  evidence  at  trial  consisted  of  the testimony,\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\neither live or through deposition, of fourteen newsroom employees\n\nand several experts in the field of journalism.\n\n          1.  Newsroom Employees:\r                    1.  Newsroom Employees:\n\n          The  Monitor's  editor-in-chief, Mike  Pride, testified\r                                \n\nthat he requires a college degree  with an emphasis in writing to\n\nwork as a staff writer or editor.  Nevertheless, he conceded that\n\na  journalism degree was not a prerequisite for employment at The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor.  In  fact, Pride and at least one-half  of the reporters\r                 \n\nwho  testified had  degrees in  subjects other  than journalism.2\n\nFor most of The Monitor's reportorial staff, this employment  was\r                                 \n\ntheir first in the field of journalism.\n\n            a.  Staff Writers\r                      a.  Staff Writers\r                                       \n\n          When  hired, The  Monitor's reporters were  assigned to\r                                             \n\ntasks  ranging  from  writing features  to  covering legislative,\n\nmunicipal, and town governments and agencies.  Some of their work\n\nwas of  a routine nature, such  as compiling lists of  the titles\n\nand  times of local showings  of motion pictures.   The reporters\n\ntestified   that  they   worked  essentially   unsupervised,  had\n\nauthority  and discretion  over  what  they  did and  wrote,  and\n\ndecided how  their assignments would be  executed.  Nevertheless,\n\nmost  of them  testified that  their time  was spent  on \"general\n\nassignment\" work and  their writing was  mainly focused on  \"hard\n\nnews.\"\n                    \r                              \n\n2  Of the 32  employees for whom back wages were sought, six held\nMasters  degrees, four of which were in journalism; 16 had earned\nBachelor's degrees;  one employee  held an Associate  degree; one\nhad taken some college  courses; and one had taken  courses at an\ninstitute of photography.\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          For  example,  staff writer  Margaret  Burton testified\n\nthat during her first  year, as an education reporter,  she wrote\n\nabout  education  issues  and  covered the  State  Department  of\n\nEducation as well  as the  meetings of the  local school  boards.\n\nWhen she  was  later assigned  to  cover court  proceedings,  she\n\nreported  \"who was  charged, what  the charges  were and  who the\n\nwitnesses were and what they said.\"\n\n          Sharon Goss testified that  she wrote \"feature stories\"\n\nwhen she first started at the paper.  She described these stories\n\nas having \"more of a  fill the page kind of mentality .  . . than\n\ngo out and  do something  really creative.\"   Ms. Goss  testified\n\nthat  when she  later  became a  regional  reporter, she  covered\n\ngovernment   and  town  planning  meetings,  visited  offices  of\n\nselectmen, called people on the phone about pertinent issues, and\n\nread  through  courthouse  documents  concerning  lawsuits  filed\n\nagainst towns.\n\n          Randall Keith  testified that during his  first year at\n\nThe  Monitor  he  spent  approximately 90  percent  of  his  time\r                      \n\ncovering city hall  and the remainder  covering police and  other\n\ngeneral assignment  stories.   Later, he  split his  time between\n\nbusiness writing and covering the police beat.  He testified that\n\nnone of his  writing was highly  complex and  that it could  have\n\nbeen done by anyone with general training and ability.\n\n            b.  Editors\r                      b.  Editors\r                                 \n\n          Lila  Locksley  testified  that  her  main duties  were\n\nreading wire stories for  grammatical and factual errors, writing\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nheadlines,  and  making improvements  so  that  the stories  were\n\nshorter  or more readable.  She also  performed layout work.  She\n\ntestified that the layout work consisted of editing  the stories,\n\nwriting  headlines, sizing photographs,  and writing the captions\n\nthat appeared beneath the photographs.\n\n          Nancy  Druelinger  offered  similar testimony,  stating\n\nthat most of her  time was spent writing headlines,  reading over\n\nand rewriting wire  stories, and laying out the pages.   She also\n\nstated that  it was  her responsibility  to decide  which stories\n\nwould appear in  the paper.  She  testified that she  thought her\n\nduties as an editor required imagination, creativity, and talent.\n\nShe  stated that decisions with  regard to legal  issues (such as\n\nwhether   a   story  was   potentially   libelous),  taste,   and\n\nnewsworthiness were all within her discretion.\n\n            c.  Photographers\r                      c.  Photographers\r                                       \n\n          Photographer Tom  Sobolik testified that 70  percent of\n\nhis work was assigned and that he had no input as to which photos\n\nwould be used in  the newspaper.  While Mr.  Sobolik acknowledged\n\nthat  there are  creative aspects  to photojournalism,  he stated\n\nthat  \"a large  proportion of  it is  pretty run-of-the-mill  and\n\npretty standardized.\"\n\n          Throughout the relevant period, Ken Williams spent most\n\nof  his   time  shooting  sports,  exteriors   and  interiors  of\n\nbuildings,  and politicians.   Mr.  Williams testified  that more\n\nthan 50 percent of his time was spent in the developing of photos\n\nin  the darkroom.  In Mr. William's opinion, \"there's very little\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nnews photography which is art\" because \"a news photographer tries\n\nto  photograph reality,  as  it  happens, without  embellishment,\n\nwithout taking sides.\"\n\n          2.   The Experts' Testimony\r                    2.   The Experts' Testimony\n\n          The  Secretary   offered  the  testimony   of  Ben   H.\n\nBagdikian,  Dean of  the  Graduate School  of  Journalism at  the\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley (\"Dean Bagdikian\").  In Dean\n\nBagdikian's  opinion, the majority of journalists do not meet the\n\nqualifications  for  professional  exemption  from  the  overtime\n\nprovisions  of the  FLSA.  He  distinguished journalism  from the\n\ntraditional professions, such as law and medicine, in which there\n\nis  an  accumulated body  of knowledge  and  a canon  which every\n\npractitioner is required  to know.   He stated  that there is  no\n\nbody of scholarly  work which  a journalist is  required to  know\n\nbefore he may practice.   Rather, a journalist must  be a skilled\n\nand accurate observer, have  good judgment, and be able  to write\n\nclearly.\n\n          Dean Bagdikian also testified  that journalism is not a\n\nfield in  which the employee's work product  depends primarily on\n\ninvention,  imagination,  or  talent.   In  his  view,  the  vast\n\nmajority of newspaper reporting centers around clear, disciplined\n\nobservation of public  events and people.   He further  testified\n\nthat although there have been significant and substantial changes\n\nin the field of journalism, these changes do not warrant changing\n\nthe  definition  of  professional  or  changing  the  Secretary's\n\nposition regarding employees in the field of journalism.\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          The  Monitor  offered  the testimony  of  Robert  Neale\r                                \n\nCopple,  Dean of the College  of Journalism at  the University of\n\nNebraska at Lincoln (\"Dean Copple\").  Dean Copple  testified that\n\nthe current field of  journalism is vastly different than  it was\n\nin the 1940's.  He  pointed out that nearly 90 percent  of modern\n\njournalists have  college degrees.   In comparison,  he estimated\n\nthat only 30  percent of  newsroom employees in  the 1940's  were\n\ncollege  graduates.  He further testified that, on the whole, the\n\njournalism  done by  the staff  at The  Monitor was  creative and\r                                                         \n\nthought-provoking, requiring both imagination and talent.\n\n          3.  The Monitor's Overtime Policy\r                    3.  The Monitor's Overtime Policy\r                                   \n\n          Coverage of  legislative sessions and  meetings of  the\n\ncity council often  caused the reporters assigned to these events\n\nto  work more than forty hours weekly.  Although weekly timecards\n\nwere   collected  for   each  newsroom   employee,  The   Monitor\r                                                                           \n\ndiscouraged overtime,  and suggested  that those who  worked more\n\nthan  40 hours should seek compensatory time in lieu of overtime.\n\nThat is, they were supposed to work fewer hours on the other days\n\nof  the week  to reduce their  total weekly  hours to  forty.  At\n\nleast three of the witnesses who testified had been told by their\n\nsuperiors  to alter the time cards submitted to reduce the amount\n\nof  overtime hours  originally listed  therein.   Those employees\n\nalso testified that they  were occasionally reprimanded when they\n\ndid report overtime and  told to alter their weekly  timecards so\n\nthat no overtime hours would be included.\n\n          On  other occasions,  time cards  for a  given employee\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nwere  completed by  a co-employee, who  necessarily did  not have\n\naccurate  information  as to  the  actual  hours worked  by  that\n\nemployee.   In light of these circumstances, many of the newsroom\n\nemployees did not bother  to prepare and file an  accurate record\n\nof all hours, including overtime, worked weekly.\n\n          Employees  did receive the compensation required by the\n\nFLSA  for the overtime hours that they actually recorded on their\n\nweekly time  cards.   Mike Pride, The  Monitor's editor-in-chief,\r                                                        \n\ntestified that  it was The Monitor's policy  to pay overtime.  He\r                                            \n\nstated that overtime  was to be  authorized in advance,  whenever\n\npossible,  but  that  the   overtime  was  always  paid,  whether\n\nauthorized or unauthorized.  Mr. Pride testified that this policy\n\nexisted to control the cost of overtime.\n\n                      PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                                PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n          On  June 22,  1981, the  Secretary brought  this action\n\nagainst  The   Monitor,  and   George  Wilson,   the  newspaper's\r                                \n\npublisher.  The  complaint alleged that, since February  4, 1978,\n\nthe newspaper  had committed  willful violations of  the overtime\n\nand  recordkeeping  provisions  of   the  FLSA,  and  that  these\n\nviolations  were continuing.   The  Secretary sought  a permanent\n\ninjunction against  the violations, and  an award of  back wages,\n\nalong with  interest and  liquidated damages.   Additionally, the\n\nSecretary claimed that three years of back  pay were appropriate,\n\nrather than the normal two, because The Monitor's FLSA violations\r                                                         \n\nhad been willful under 29 U.S.C.   255(a).\n\n          In  its  answer,  The  Monitor  denied  the Secretary's\r                                                  \n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nallegations  and  asserted as  an  affirmative  defense that  the\n\nemployees were exempt from the applicable regulations of the Act,\n\nthat any violation was the  result of good faith reliance on  the\n\nDepartment's \"interpretations and/or past rulings,\" and  that the\n\nclaims were time barred.\n\n          The case  was tried to  the bench.  With  regard to the\n\nalleged FLSA  violations at The Monitor,  the Secretary presented\r                                                 \n\nthe testimony  of Department of Labor  (\"DOL\") Compliance Officer\n\nScott  Wilkinson,  and  thirteen  reporters,  photographers,  and\n\neditors  employed  by The  Monitor.   Throughout  the  trial, the\r                                            \n\nSecretary  denied The  Monitor's  claim that  its employees  were\r                                        \n\nexempt  professionals.   For  over  forty  years the  Secretary's\n\nposition,  set forth in non-binding departmental interpretations,\n\nhad  been  that  the  majority  of  journalists  are  not  exempt\n\nprofessionals under  the FLSA.   The Secretary stood  behind this\n\nposition  and  presented expert  testimony  in support  of  it at\n\ntrial.    The  Secretary   also  attempted  to  present  employee\n\ntestimony concerning  alleged  FLSA violations  occurring at  The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor after January 26, 1980, the last day covered by the DOL's\r                 \n\ninvestigation.   The Monitor objected to  this testimony, arguing\r                                      \n\nthat the Secretary could not enlarge its claims  without amending\n\nits  complaint.    The   district  court  allowed  the  proffered\n\ntestimony  but  reserved a  final ruling  on  the matter  for its\n\nopinion.\n\n          In its  defense, The Monitor primarily  argued that the\r                                                \n\nSecretary's   forty-year-old   journalism  interpretations   were\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nobsolete  and  did not  reflect  the rigors  and  complexities of\n\nmodern  journalism.  The Monitor  moved the court  to declare the\r                                          \n\ninterpretations  null and  void  and hold  that  the majority  of\n\nmodern journalists  qualify  as exempt  professionals  under  the\n\nFLSA.  As a fallback position, The Monitor contended, albeit less\r                                                    \n\nvigorously,   that  its   employees  were   exempt  professionals\n\nregardless  of  whether  the  court  overturned  the  Secretary's\n\ninterpretations.    The Monitor  also  maintained  that any  FLSA\r                                         \n\nviolations it may have committed were not willful.\n\n          Although the trial was  completed in 1986, the district\n\ncourt  did  not  issue  its  opinion  and  final  judgment  until\n\nNovember 3,  1993.3  The court found  that The Monitor's newsroom\r                                                                \n                    \r                              \n\n3   The Monitor contends  that the  seven year delay  between the\r                         \ntwo-week  trial and  the decision  constitutes  reversible error.\nThis type of delay,  particularly in light of the  sparse factual\nfindings,  concerns us.   Not  only does  it affect  the parties'\nrights to a speedy adjudication of their claims, it detracts from\nthe public perception of the judicial  system.  Nevertheless, The\r                                                                           \nMonitor has failed  to enlighten us as  to how the delay  damaged\r                 \nthe  credibility of  the district  court's findings  or otherwise\nprejudiced  The Monitor.  We are in agreement with the sentiments\r                                 \nexpressed  by the  Ninth  Circuit while  contemplating a  similar\ndelay:\n\n            We are appalled by  the delay, but we are\n            aware  of no case holding that a district\n            court commits reversible error  by taking\n            too long  to decide  a case.   Indeed, we\n            doubt that appellate review could ever be\n            an effective means of  enforcing district\n            court  timeliness. .  .  . To  vacate and\n            remand  a  decision  which  the  district\n            court  has  spent several  years crafting\n            hardly seems  a sensible means  to reduce\n            delay.   To reverse  the decision on  the\n            ground  of  delay  would  require  us  to\n            presume    that   lengthy    deliberation\n            inevitably  leads  to  mistake.  .   .  .\n            Although  we  do  not  condone  the  long\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nemployees were not entitled to the professional exemption of  the\n\nAct's overtime requirements and awarded back wages and liquidated\n\ndamages to twelve employees.   However, the court found  that the\n\nviolations had  not  been committed  willfully  and  consequently\n\nlimited the damages to  the two-year period before the  filing of\n\nthe suit  rather than the three-year period applicable to willful\n\nviolations.  The  court refused to  award damages for  violations\n\noccurring after the close  of the DOL's compliance investigation,\n\nand it denied the Secretary's  request for a permanent injunction\n\nagainst future violations.\n\n          In   finding  that  the   employees  were   not  exempt\n\nprofessionals,  the court  relied  on the  Secretary's journalism\n\ninterpretations as persuasive  authority.  These  interpretations\n\nstate in pertinent part:\n\n            Newspaper  writing  of  the  exempt  type\n            must,   therefore,    be   'predominantly\n            original  and   creative  in  character.'\n            Only   writing   which   is   analytical,\n            interpretative  or highly  individualized\n            is considered to be creative in nature. .\n            .   .      Newspaper   writers   commonly\n            performing  work  which  is original  and\n            creative  within the  meaning of    541.3\n            are   editorial    writers,   columnists,\n            critics,  and   'top-flight'  writers  of\n            analytical and interpretative articles.\n\n            (2) The reporting of news,  the rewriting\n                    \r                              \n\n            delay,  we  are  not  willing  to  assume\n            without  strong independent  support that\n            the  district  court  departed  from  its\n            proper  role  and  considered   only  the\n            evidence that was easiest to recall.\n\nPhonetele,  Inc. v.

Rather, the  court accepted  the interpretations  as\n\npersuasive authority  of how to apply  the professional exemption\n\nin  the  field  of  journalism.    Once  credited  as  persuasive\n\nauthority, the  Secretary's interpretations  all but decided  the\n\nexemption issues.   The Monitor presented  little or no  evidence\r                                         \n\nsuggesting    that    its   employees    performed   \"analytical,\n\ninterpretative  or  highly individualized\"  work.    Nor did  The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor   aver  that  its   reporters  were  \"editorial  writers,\r                 \n\ncolumnists, critics,  and 'top-flight' writers  of analytical and\n\ninterpretative  articles.\"    The  Monitor  made  no  significant\r                                                    \n\nattempt   to   differentiate   the   work   of   its   reporters,\n\nphotographers, and editors from the work done  at every newspaper\n\nthroughout the country.   The Monitor's trial strategy hinged  on\r                                               \n\nits dogmatic attempt  to debunk the Secretary's  interpretations,\n\nand  when this failed, its chances of prevailing on the exemption\n\nissues dwindled.\n                    \r                              \n\n4   On October 9,  1992, the interpretive  regulations, 29 C.F.R.\n  541.301,  541.302  and  541.303,  were   redesignated,  without\nchange,   as  29   C.F.R.      541.300,   541.301  and   541.302,\nrespectively.    57 Fed.

The\r                                    \n\nSecretary  appealed  the   district  court's  finding  concerning\n\nwillfulness, its refusal  to issue an injunction, and its refusal\n\nto  award damages for violations occurring after the close of the\n\nDOL's   compliance  investigation.    The  Monitor  appealed  the\r                                                            \n\ndistrict  court's decision  that  its employees  were not  exempt\n\nprofessionals.    The  Monitor's   appeal  reiterates  its  trial\r                                        \n\nstrategy  and   rests  primarily  on  the   contention  that  the\n\nSecretary's   journalism   interpretations  have   been  rendered\n\nobsolete by  the technological and  societal changes of  the last\n\nforty years.

Id.\r                                                                           \n\nHowever, these  overtime compensation provisions do  not apply to\n\n\"any employees employed in a bona fide executive, administrative,\n\nor professional capacity  . . .  (as such  terms are defined  and\n\ndelimited from time to  time by regulations of the  Secretary [of\n\nLabor] . . .).\"  29 U.S.C.   213(a)(1).  The  employer in an FLSA\n\ncase bears  the  burden of  establishing that  its employees  are\n\nexempt,  and   because  of  the  remedial  nature  of  the  FLSA,\n\nexemptions are  to be  \"narrowly construed against  the employers\n\nseeking to  assert them  and their application  limited to  those\n\nestablishments  plainly and unmistakably  within their  terms and\n\nspirit.\"  Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U.S. 388, 392 (1960);\r                                                \n\nSecretary of Labor v. DeSisto, 929 F.2d 789, 797 (1st  Cir. 1991)\r                                       \n\n(citations omitted).\n\n          The specific requirements of the professional exemption\n\nare not set  forth in the statute.   Rather, they are articulated\n\nin  the regulations  and interpretations  of the Secretary.   The\n\nSecretary's  regulations are promulgated  pursuant to  an express\n\ndelegation of legislative authority and must be given controlling\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nweight unless  they are  found  to be  arbitrary, capricious,  or\n\ncontrary to the statute.  See Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources\r                                                                           \n\nDefense Council, Inc., 467  U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984).   Unlike the\r                               \n\nregulations,  however,  the Secretary's  interpretations  are not\n\nconclusive, even  in  the cases  with which  they directly  deal.\n\nSkidmore v.  Swift &amp; Co.,  323 U.S. 134, 139-40  (1944).  Rather,\r                                  \n\nthey merely set forth the official position of the DOL on how the\n\nregulations    should   be   applied    in   specific   contexts.\n\nNevertheless,  the courts  may refer  to the  interpretations for\n\nguidance.  See id.\r                            \n\n          The  relevant legal guidelines  for determining whether\n\nan employee  is  an  exempt  professional are  described  in  the\n\nSecretary's  regulation   29  C.F.R.     541.3.     The  relevant\n\ninterpretations are set forth at 29 C.F.R.   541.301, 541.302 and\n\n541.303.  The regulation enumerates several types of professional\n\nexemptions,  two  of  which  are  relevant  here:  the  so-called\n\n\"learned professional\" and \"artistic professional\" exemptions.\n\n            1.  The Learned Professional Exemption\r                      1.  The Learned Professional Exemption\n\n          The   learned   professional   exemption   deals   with\n\noccupations   which   have  specific   educational  requirements,\n\nincluding  law,  accounting, engineering,  architecture, nursing,\n\nand medicine.   Reich v. Gateway  Press, Inc.,  13 F.3d 685,  698\r                                                       \n\nn.15 (3d Cir. 1994).   The regulation states that  this exemption\n\napplies  to employees  whose \"primary  duty\" consists  of \"[w]ork\n\nrequiring  knowledge of  an  advance [sic]  type  in a  field  of\n\nscience or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nspecialized  intellectual instruction and study, as distinguished\n\nfroma general academic education. . . .\" 29 C.F.R.   541.3(a)(1).\n\n          The    interpretations    state   that    \"[t]he   word\n\n'customarily'  implies that  in the  vast majority  of  cases the\n\nspecific academic  training is  a prerequisite for  entrance into\n\nthe  profession.\"   29  C.F.R.    541.302(d).   Moreover,  \"[t]he\n\ntypical symbol of  the professional training  and the best  prima\n\nfacie evidence of  its possession is, of course,  the appropriate\n\nacademic degree,  and in  these professions an  advanced academic\n\ndegree is a standard (if not universal) prerequisite.\"  29 C.F.R.\n\n   541.302(e)(1).  The  interpretations specifically declare that\n\nthe  exemption  does  not  encompass  \"such  quasi-professions as\n\njournalism in which the bulk of the employees have acquired their\n\nskill  by  experience  rather  than  by  any  formal  specialized\n\ntraining.\"    29  C.F.R.    541.302(d).    Further,  \"[n]ewspaper\n\nwriters,  with   possible  rare  exceptions  in   certain  highly\n\ntechnical fields,  do not meet the  requirements of   541.3(a)(1)\n\nfor exemption  as professional employees of  the 'learned' type.\"\n\n29 C.F.R.   541.303(f)(1).\n\n            2.  The Artistic Professional Exemption\r                      2.  The Artistic Professional Exemption\n\n          The artistic exemption applies to professionals working\n\nin a \"recognized field of artistic endeavor.\"  29 C.F.R.   541.3.\n\nExempt  artistic  professionals  may  be found  in  many  fields,\n\nincluding  music,  writing,  the  theater, and  the  plastic  and\n\ngraphic arts.\n\n          The  regulation outlines both a short and long test for\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\ndetermining  whether   an  employee  qualifies  as   an  artistic\n\nprofessional.  The  long test  is applied to  employees who  earn\n\nweekly salaries of  at least $170 but less than  $250.  The short\n\ntest is used for  employees whose weekly salary is  not less than\n\n$250.5   Both  tests demand  that the  employee's \"primary  duty\"\n\nconsist  of  work requiring  \"invention,  imagination, or  talent\n\n. . . .\"   29 C.F.R.   541.3.   The long test  also requires that\n\nthe employee's primary  duty consist of \"[w]ork that  is original\n\nand creative in character . . . .\"  29 C.F.R.   541.3(a)(2).\n\n          The interpretations state that \"[o]nly writing which is\n\nanalytical,  interpretive or highly  individualized is considered\n\nto  be creative  in nature.  .  . .   Newspaper  writers commonly\n\nperforming work which is original and creative within the meaning\n\nof   541.3 are editorial writers, columnists,  critics, and 'top-\n\nflight'  writers of  analytical and  interpretive articles.\"   29\n\nC.F.R.    541.303(f)(1).     With   regard  to   the  \"invention,\n\nimagination,    or    talent\"   requirement,    the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation says:\n\n            In the case  of newspaper employees,  the\n            distinction  here  is   similar  to   the\n            distinction observed . . .  in connection\n            with  the  requirement that  the  work be\n            \"original  and  creative  in  character.\"\n            Obviously  the  majority of  reporters do\n            work    which   depends    primarily   on\n            intelligence,  diligence,  and  accuracy.\n                    \r                              \n\n5  As the Third Circuit noted, \"[t]he short test was added to the\nFLSA in 1949 in large part because the DOL felt that salary level\nturned out to be  a good proxy for determination  of professional\nstatus.\"   Gateway Press, Inc., 13 F.3d at 698 n.16.  That is, in\r                                        \nthe  DOL's judgment, higher salaried employees are more likely to\nmeet all the requirements of the exemption.  Id.\r                                                          \n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n            It  is  the minority  whose  work depends\n            primarily on  \"invention, imagination, or\n            talent.\"\n\n29 C.F.R.   541.303(d).\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\n            B.  The Authority of the Journalism Interpretations\r                      B.  The Authority of the Journalism Interpretations\r                                                                         \n\n          The  Secretary's  journalism  interpretations have  not\n\nchanged  in any  material  respect since  1949,  long before  the\n\nnewspaper industry evolved  into its current  form.  The  parties\n\nvigorously dispute what weight, if any, courts  should give these\n\ninterpretations when they apply the regulation.  The Monitor asks\r                                                                      \n\nus to declare that  the interpretations are obsolete  and invalid\n\nbecause they do not reflect the complexities and rigors of modern\n\njournalism.  The Secretary  contends that the interpretations are\n\nstill  highly  relevant because  the  technological  and societal\n\nchanges of the last  forty years have not altered  the day-to-day\n\nduties of the majority of reporters.\n\n          This is the central issue on appeal.  Once the district\n\ncourt  accepted  them  as persuasive  authority,  the Secretary's\n\ninterpretations were  nearly conclusive on the  exemption issues.\n\nThe  Monitor made  a  less extensive  effort  to prove  that  its\r                      \n\nemployees   performed   \"analytical,  interpretative   or  highly\n\nindividualized\" work.  The Monitor made no significant attempt to\r                                            \n\ndifferentiate  the  work  of  its  reporters,  photographers, and\n\neditors  from the  work done  at every  newspaper throughout  the\n\ncountry.  Therefore, in light of The Monitor's trial strategy, if\r                                                      \n\nwe  decline to  invalidate  the  journalism interpretations,  the\n\nrecord  will almost certainly  compel us  to affirm  the district\n\ncourt's decision on the exemption issues.\n\n          As   we   noted   above,   although   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretations are not controlling, courts may refer to them for\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nguidance.   Skidmore  v. Swift  &amp; Co.,  323 U.S.  at 139-40.   In\r                                               \n\nmaking a similar determination,6 the Supreme Court noted:\n\n            [w]e    consider   that    the   rulings,\n            interpretations   and  opinions   of  the\n            Administrator under this  Act, while  not\n            controlling upon the  courts by reason of\n            their authority, do constitute a  body of\n            experience and informed judgment to which\n            courts and litigants may  properly resort\n            for  guidance.    The  weight of  such  a\n            judgment in a particular case will depend\n            upon  the  thoroughness  evident  in  its\n            consideration,   the   validity  of   its\n            reasoning,  its consistency  with earlier\n            and later pronouncements,  and all  those\n            factors which give it power  to persuade,\n            if lacking power to control.\n\nSkidmore,  323  U.S.  at 140.    The  Monitor  contends that  the\r                                                       \n\ndistrict court  misapplied Skidmore.   Specifically, The  Monitor\r                                                                           \n\nasserts that any reliance  on the Secretary's interpretations was\n\nerroneous  because they  are \"outdated,  inconsistent  with other\n\nagency pronouncements, and contain vague and undefined terms.\"7\n                    \r                              \n\n6  In Skidmore,  the Supreme Court was evaluating  the persuasive\r                        \nweight  of the opinions, interpretations, and rulings of the Wage\nand Hour Administrator under the FLSA.\n\n7   We  are  unpersuaded by  The  Monitor's contention  that  the\r                                                   \nSecretary's  interpretations should have been disregarded because\nthey  are  inconsistent  with  other  agency  pronouncements  and\ninternally inconsistent.\n\n   There  is no rule of law requiring an administrative agency to\ngive  a  term  the  same  definition  in  all  contexts.    \"When\nconstruing  the  FLSA  and  its exemptions,  courts  should  look\nprimarily  to  the  purpose   of  the  act  itself  --   and  not\ninterpretations  of  the same  or a  similar  term made  in other\ncontexts.\"  Reich v. Gateway Press, Inc., 13 F.3d at 699 n.17.  \r                                                  \nWith  regard  to  the  assertion  that  the  interpretations  are\ninternally  inconsistent, we  follow the  reasoning of  the Third\nCircuit:\n\n            \"We     also    reject     the    amicus'\n            characterization  of  the interpretations\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\n          As  a preliminary  matter, we  discuss the  standard of\n\nreview appropriate  for appellate scrutiny of  a district court's\n\nSkidmore analysis.8   Although  we have not  previously addressed\r                  \n\nthis  issue, the Fifth Circuit  provides meaningful guidance.  In\n\nDalheim v.  KDFW-TV, a television station  charged with violating\r                             \n\nthe FLSA's overtime provisions made essentially the same argument\n\nasserted  by  The  Monitor: that  \"the  district  court gave  the\r                                    \n\ninterpretations  undue  weight,  thus   blinding  itself  to  the\n\nrealities of modern  broadcast journalism.\"  918  F.2d 1220, 1228\n\n(5th  Cir. 1990).   The  Fifth Circuit  reasoned that  a district\n\ncourt's Skidmore  analysis is  merely a fact-specific  inquiry to\r                          \n\n                    \r                              \n\n            as  being  'self-contradictory'   because\n            they  state  that  'many'  reporters  are\n            exempt   while  'many'  are   not.    The\n            interpretations merely recognize that the\n            determination of whether  a reporter is a\n            professional does not depend on the title\n            that a  paper gives a reporter.   Rather,\n            it  instead  depends  upon  the  specific\n            characteristics  of  a  given  reporter's\n            job.\"\n\nId.\r             \n\n8   There are, in  fact, two inquiries that  must be made  when a\ncourt  is  determining   what  weight  should  be   given  to  an\nadministrative interpretation.   First,  a court will  declare an\ninterpretation  invalid   if  it   is  found  to   be  arbitrary,\ncapricious,  or  contrary   to  the  statute.    See   Martin  v.\r                                                                       \nOccupational  Safety and Health Review  Comm'n, 499 U.S. 144, 158\r                                                        \n(1991)  (holding  that  the  \"Secretary's  interpretation  of  an\nambiguous  regulation   is  subject  to  the   same  standard  of\nsubstantive review  as any other exercise  of delegated lawmaking\npower.\"); Chevron U.S.A.  v. Natural  Resources Defense  Council,\r                                                                           \nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984).  Second, the court applies the\r              \nSkidmore analysis to determine  the level of deference  it should\r                  \naccord a valid administrative interpretation.  Here, we  are only\nconcerned with the second  inquiry because neither party contends\nthat the Secretary's interpretations are invalid under the first.\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\ndetermine whether  the interpretation reflects an  analogy useful\n\nin  deciding the  case before  it.   Id.   Thus, any  \"attempt to\r                                                  \n\ndebunk  the  analogy between  the  interpretation's  portrayal of\n\nbroadcasting and  journalism as  they existed  in the 1940's  and\n\nbroadcast journalism as it exists today is a veiled attack on the\n\ndistrict court's findings of fact.\"  Id.  Consequently, because a\r                                                  \n\ndistrict court's  Skidmore analysis  is fact-based, we  review it\r                                    \n\nsubject  to the  clearly erroneous  standard  of Federal  Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 52(a).\n\n          Both the Secretary and The  Monitor presented extensive\r                                                       \n\nexpert  testimony as  to whether  the technological  and societal\n\nchanges of  the past forty  years have  rendered the  Secretary's\n\njournalism interpretations obsolete.  The Secretary presented the\n\ntestimony  of  Ben  Bagdikian,  Dean of  the  Graduate  School of\n\nJournalism  at   the  University   of  California   at  Berkeley.\n\nMr. Bagdikian testified that although the field of journalism has\n\nchanged  radically, these  changes do  not warrant  modifying the\n\nSecretary's view that  most journalists do not  qualify as exempt\n\nprofessionals under  the FLSA.   In  his view,  the focus  of the\n\nmajority of  journalists is the same today  as it was forty years\n\nago:   to report disciplined  observations of  public people  and\n\npublic events.  This  testimony essentially ends appellate review\n\nof  the matter.  It was neither severely impeached nor inherently\n\nimplausible,  and  \"[o]nce credited,  it  supported  the district\n\ncourt's rationale  almost  singlehandedly.\"   Rivera-G mez v.  de\r                                                                           \n\nCastro,  900 F.2d  1, 4  (1st Cir. 1990).   Although  The Monitor\r                                                                           \n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\npresented conflicting testimony, the district court's decision to\n\naccept the interpretations as persuasive authority cannot be said\n\nto be clearly erroneous.9\n\n            C.

In reviewing  this\r                                    \n\nissue,  we elect to follow the Fifth Circuit's approach, in which\n\nthe  appellate court separates out the questions of fact from the\n\nultimate  legal  conclusion  and  applies   a  clearly  erroneous\n\nstandard to the  former while exercising plenary  review over the\n\nlatter.  Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1226.\r                          \n\n          As the  Fifth Circuit  noted, there are  three distinct\n\ntypes of findings involved in determining whether  an employee is\n                    \r                              \n\n9  The Monitor  also contends that the district  court mistakenly\r                        \nconfused  a  Wage  and Hour  Administrator's  interpretation,  29\nC.F.R.    541.303, with the  Secretary of Labor's  regulation, 29\nC.F.R.    541.3, and  thus applied  incorrect legal  standards in\ndetermining that The Monitor's employees were not exempt from the\r                                      \novertime provisions of the FLSA.  We    find   this    contention\ncompletely  without  merit.    As we  noted  above,  the district\ncourt's  Skidmore   analysis  and  subsequent   reliance  on  the\r                           \nSecretary's interpretations were not in error.  Our review of the\nrecord and  the district  court's opinion  indicates that  it was\nwell  aware  of  the  distinction  between  the  regulations  and\ninterpretations.   Indeed,  the district  court's  opinion quotes\nfrom Skidmore immediately  prior to its refusal to  disregard the\r                       \nSecretary's interpretations.  Reich v. Newspapers of New England,\r                                                                           \nInc., 834 F. Supp. 530, 535 (1993).  The only evidence supporting\r              \nThe  Monitor's contention is  the fact that  the district court's\r                      \nopinion incorrectly refers to the interpretations as regulations.\nSee,  e.g., id.  at 534-35.   These misstatements,  considered in\r                         \nlight of the  record and the district  court's Skidmore analysis,\r                                                                 \ndo   not  indicate   that   the  district   court  confused   the\ninterpretations  and regulations.  Rather, this  is more likely a\nmatter   of   miscitation  than   an   indication   of  a   basic\nmisunderstanding.\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nexempt.    Id.   First,  the  district  court  makes findings  of\r                        \n\nhistorical fact, regarding, for example, the day-to-day duties of\n\nthe  employees.   Id.   These  are  reviewed under  the  \"clearly\r                               \n\nerroneous\"  standard of  Federal Rule  of Civil  Procedure 52(a).\n\nId.; see also Icicle  Seafoods v.

Second,  to  apply  the  Secretary's  regulations,  the\n\ndistrict court  must draw conclusions from  the historical facts.\n\nDalheim,  918 F.2d at 1226.   For example,  whether an employee's\r                 \n\nwork  requires  \"invention, imagination,  or talent\"  and whether\n\nsuch  work   constitutes   an  employee's   \"primary  duty\"   are\n\nconclusions drawn from historical  facts.   Id.   Such inferences\r                                                         \n\nare also  subject to  the clearly  erroneous standard of  review.\n\nId.    Lastly,  the  district  court  makes  the  ultimate  legal\r             \n\nconclusion  of whether an employee  is exempt.   Although this is\n\nbased  on both historical facts  and factual inferences,  it is a\n\nconclusion of law, over  which we exercise plenary review.

The long test is applied\n\nto employees who  earn weekly salaries of at least  $170 but less\n\nthan $250.

The  Monitor  contends  that  the district  court\r                                      \n\nincorrectly   required  that  the   newspaper  writing  of  these\n\nemployees be \"'predominantly original and creative in character'\"\n\nwhen  the correct  standard merely  required that  the employee's\n\n\"primary duty\" consist of \"work requiring invention, imagination,\n\nor talent in a recognized field  of artistic endeavor.\"  Reich v.\r                                                                        \n\nNewspapers  of New England, Inc.,  834 F.

The Monitor claims that this was reversible error because\r                             \n\nthe district court erroneously required these employees to meet a\n\nmuch more difficult standard.\n\n          The district  court's opinion suggests that  it did not\n\nspecifically apply  the  short test  to  those employees  of  The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor  with weekly salaries above $250.  However, as we discuss\r                 \n\nbelow,  our  review of  the record  against  the backdrop  of the\n\nSecretary's interpretations leads us to conclude that these three\n\nemployees do  not qualify as exempt  artistic professionals, even\n\nunder  the short  test.   Therefore, even  if the  district court\n\nerroneously  applied  the \"original  and  creative in  character\"\n\nrequirement of the long test, this error was harmless.\n\n          The  relevant portion of the  short test requires us to\n\ndetermine (1) the employee's \"primary duty,\" and  (2) whether the\n\nperformance  of  that duty  requires \"invention,  imagination, or\n\ntalent.\"  Because the  Secretary stipulated that writing  was the\n\nprimary  duty of  these employees,  the  only issue  remaining is\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nwhether   their  writing  required  \"invention,  imagination,  or\n\ntalent.\"    With  regard  to  the  \"invention,   imagination,  or\n\ntalent\" requirement, the Secretary's interpretation says:\n\n            In the case  of newspaper employees,  the\n            distinction  here  is   similar  to   the\n            distinction observed . . .  in connection\n            with  the  requirement that  the  work be\n            \"original  and  creative  in  character.\"\n            Obviously  the  majority of  reporters do\n            work    which   depends    primarily   on\n            intelligence,  diligence,  and  accuracy.\n            It is  the  minority whose  work  depends\n            primarily on  \"invention, imagination, or\n            talent.\"\n\n29 C.F.R.   541.303.11  The  district court found, and we  agree,\n\nthat The Monitor employees did not fulfill this requirement.\r                          \n\n          The record  demonstrates that the  day-to-day duties of\n\nthese three reporters consisted primarily of \"general assignment\"\n\nwork.  Among other things,  their stories covered public  utility\n\ncommission hearings; criminal and police activity; city and state\n                    \r                              \n\n11  We follow the reasoning of the Third Circuit's Gateway Press,\r                                                                           \nInc.  opinion and  reject the  argument that  the interpretations\r              \nonly apply to the long test:\n\n            \"Although  this   interpretation  of  the\n            phrase   'invention,   imagination,    or\n            talent' seems  to refer to the  phrase as\n            it is used in [the long test] rather than\n            as it is used  in [the short test], there\n            is nothing  to suggest that such a phrase\n            has  a  different  meaning  in   the  two\n            different   parts  of   the  regulations.\n            Indeed,   as   a   matter  of   statutory\n            construction,  where one word  is used in\n            one   place,  it  should  have  the  same\n            meaning  in  another  place in  the  same\n            statute . . .

The field of newspaper writing\n\nis  certainly a medium capable of sustaining creativity.  We want\n\nto reiterate  that whether an employee is  an exempt professional\n\nis  independent  of  the  title  the  employer  ascribes  to  the\n\nposition.

Without passing on the merits of\r              \nthis  decision, we note that  it is distinguishable  on its facts\nfrom  the  present  case.    Most  notably,  the  Sherwood  court\r                                                                    \ndistinguished the work of  reporters at The Washington  Post from\r                                                                      \nthe type of small  town reporting addressed by the  Third Circuit\nin  Gateway  Press, Inc..    Thus,  the  district court's  second\r                                  \nopinion  in Sherwood  again  highlights  the distinction  between\r                              \n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\n            b.  Long Test Employees\r                      b.  Long Test Employees\n\n          The  Monitor  also  contends that  the  district  court\r                                \n\nmisapplied   the  long   test,   and  consequently,   erroneously\n\ndetermined  that the remainder of  The Monitor employees at issue\r                                                        \n\nin  this case were  not exempt professionals.   Specifically, The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor  contends that  the  record demonstrates  that the  staff\r                 \n\nwriters,  photographers, and  editors at  The Monitor  qualify as\r                                                               \n\nexempt artistic professionals under  a correct application of the\n\nregulation.  We disagree.\n\n          As we noted above, the district court's reliance on the\n\nSecretary's  interpretations  was  not  erroneous.     Therefore,\n\nbecause we  find that the  district court conducted  its analysis\n\nwithin the correct legal framework, we review its factfinding for\n\nclear error.\n\n            i.  Staff Writers:\r                      i.  Staff Writers:\n\n          With regard  to the  staff writers salaried  below $250\n\nper week, their day-to-day  responsibilities were very similar to\n\nthose of the staff  writers discussed above.  For  example, staff\n\nwriter  Margaret  Burton  testified  that three  fourths  of  her\n\nstories  covered hard news, such as the proceedings of the school\n\nboard, educational issues, trials and court hearings, as  well as\n\nthe  legislative hearings.  She estimated that only one fourth of\n\nher  writing  constituted  feature  writing   requiring  in-depth\n\ninterpretation or analysis.\n\n          Staff writer  Sharon  Goss testified  that  during  her\n                    \r                              \n\nexempt and non-exempt work in the field of journalism.\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nfirst year at the paper, she spent approximately sixty percent of\n\nher time writing what  she called feature stories.  The topics of\n\nthese  stories were  usually  assigned by  an editor,  and rarely\n\ndemanded  the  imagination,  interpretation,  or  invention  that\n\ncharacterizes exempt  newspaper writing.14   The remaining  forty\n\npercent was  divided between \"deadline work\"  and clerical tasks,\n\nsuch  as  compiling  local movie  listings.    During the  latter\n\nportion  of her tenure at The Monitor, as an educational reporter\r                                               \n\nand  a  regional reporter,  she  covered  educational issues  and\n\ngovernment and town planning meetings.\n\n          Staff writer Randall Keith testified that the vast bulk\n\nof his first year at The  Monitor was spent working the city hall\r                                           \n\nbeat.   His second year  was divided between  covering the police\n\nbeat and  business  writing.   His  third  year was  spent  as  a\n\nregional  reporter,   covering  town  meetings   and  activities.\n\nOverall,  he described his day  to day duties  as being primarily\n\nthe type of  general assignment work which could  be accomplished\n\nby anyone with general intellectual training and ability.\n\n          As these  examples make clear,  the employees  salaried\n\nbelow $250  had substantially the same  responsibilities as those\n\nreporters,   discussed   above,   with   salaries   above   $250.\n\nConsequently, we find  that the record contains ample support for\n\nthe  district court's  conclusion that  these reporters  were not\n\n                    \r                              \n\n14  For instance, one story reported on the local attitude toward\nthe rising price  of hamburgers.   Another story, on a  local man\nwho had just opened  an art store, centered on  his business, his\ngoods, and whether he thought it would succeed.\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nperforming  the  type of  work that  would  qualify them  for the\n\nartistic  professional exemption.    Rather,  like their  higher-\n\nsalaried counterparts,  they were like the  majority of reporters\n\nin that their work \"depends primarily on intelligence, diligence,\n\nand accuracy.\"  They were not performing duties which would place\n\nthem in  that minority of reporters \"whose work depends primarily\n\non 'invention, imaging [sic], or talent.'\"\n\n            ii.  Photographers:\r                      ii.  Photographers:\n\n          We  also  find ample  support  in  the record  for  the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the photographers at The Monitor\r                                                                           \n\nwere not performing exempt work.   Staff photographer Tom Sobolik\n\ntestified that most of his film  was shot at sporting events.  He\n\nalso listened to the police radio and photographed any newsworthy\n\nevents  it   reported,  including   auto  accidents  and   fires.\n\nApproximately seventy  percent of  Tom Sobolik's  photography was\n\nassigned.  Further,  he testified  that although  there are  some\n\ncreative aspects to his photography, \"a large proportion of it is\n\npretty run of the mill and pretty standardized.\"\n\n          Ken  Williams  testified  that  he spent  most  of  his\n\npicture-shooting time photographing  sporting events, the  pet of\n\nthe week,  interiors and exteriors of  buildings, press meetings,\n\nand meetings with the Governor.  He also spent a  large amount of\n\ntime in the  darkroom developing  the pictures he  and the  other\n\nphotographers had shot.   He conceded that the darkroom  work and\n\nthe  majority of his photography did not, in his mind, constitute\n\nartistic work.\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\n          The  testimony  of these  photographers  indicates that\n\nthey, like the  staff writers,  were not performing  the type  of\n\nphotographic  work which  would qualify  them under  the artistic\n\nexemption.15\n\n            iii.  Editors:\r                      iii.  Editors:\n\n          The Monitor asserts that the district court erroneously\r                               \n\nruled that  three editors were not  exempt artistic professionals\n\nunder  the long test despite the Secretary's concession that they\n\nwere  exempt under the short  test.  Because  this contention has\n\nabsolutely no basis in the record, we reject it.\n\n          Admittedly,  the  Secretary  concluded  that  the three\n\neditors  at issue  --  Sharon Goss,  Nancy  Druelinger, and  Lila\n\nLocksley  -- qualified  for  exemption once  their salaries  rose\n\nabove  $250.  Having so concluded, however, the Secretary did not\n\npursue,  and the court did  not award, back  wages for the period\n\nduring  which  these  employees were  paid  over  $250 per  week.\n\nRather,  the court  concluded that  before their  weekly salaries\n\nrose  above $250,  these editors  were not  performing work  that\n\nqualified  them for  exemption under the  long test  for artistic\n\nprofessionals,16 which requires  that their primary  duty consist\n                    \r                              \n\n15   The  Monitor contends  that  the district  court erroneously\r                           \napplied  the long test to  Ken Williams, whose  weekly salary was\nabove $250.  The opinion does not conclusively indicate what test\nwas  applied to  Ken Williams.   Nevertheless,  we find  that the\nerror, if indeed there was one, was harmless.  The work performed\nby  Mr.  Williams did  not  require  \"invention, imagination,  or\ntalent,\" and thus is not exempt, even under the short test.\n\n16  The Monitor's  brief suggests that there is  an inconsistency\r                         \nbetween the  Secretary's decision  not to pursue  back wages  for\neditors paid over $250 per week and the district court's decision\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\nof \"[w]ork that is original and creative in character\" and \"which\n\ndepends primarily on the invention, imagination, or talent of the\n\nemployee . . . .\"  29 C.F.R.   541.3(a)(2).\n\n          We find this  conclusion to have  ample support in  the\n\nrecord.  Ms. Locksley testified that her main duties were reading\n\nwire  stories  for   grammatical  and  factual   errors,  writing\n\nheadlines,  and  making improvements  so  that  the stories  were\n\nshorter  or  more  readable.    Ms.  Druelinger  offered  similar\n\ntestimony,  stating  that most  of  her  time was  spent  writing\n\nheadlines, reading  over and  rewriting wire stories,  and laying\n\nout  the   pages.17     Ms.  Goss's  testimony   was  comparable.\n\nOverall, their day-to-day work was the type of  routine editorial\n\nwork  that is generally considered  non-exempt.  See  29 C.F.R.  \r                                                              \n\n541.303(f)  (The  reporting of  news,  the  rewriting of  stories\n\nreceived from various sources, or the routine editorial work of a\n\nnewspaper is not predominantly original and creative in character\n\nwithin the meaning of   541.3 and must be considered as nonexempt\n\nwork.).\n                    \r                              \n\nthat the lower paid editors  were not exempt under the long  test\nfor artistic  professionals.  Once  again, The Monitor  is wrong.\r                                                                \nThe Secretary determined that the higher paid editors were exempt\nunder the executive  exemption 29 C.F.R.   541.1 -- not the short\ntest for artistic professionals.\n\n17   Admittedly,  layout and  page design  can qualify  under the\nartistic  professional   exemption.    In  fact,   the  Secretary\nconcluded  that  Tom Chants,  an editor  at  The Monitor,  was an\r                                                                  \nexempt artistic professional.  However,  as Druelinger testified,\nChants's work was considerably different  from the work that she,\nMs.  Locksley, and Ms.  Goss performed:  \"Tom  Chants, he did the\nbeautiful art work pages.   He was able to take lots of  time and\ndid not  do the breaking  news.  He  did the beautiful  features,\nlayouts and fill.  He had a lot more time to do his pages.\"\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\n            2.  The Learned Professional Exemption\r                      2.  The Learned Professional Exemption\n\n          The  district  court  also   held  that  The  Monitor's\r                                                                         \n\njournalists  did  not  qualify  under  the  learned  professional\n\nexemption of 29 C.F.R.   541.3.  In  a footnote to its brief, The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor  joins  its  amici  supporters in  contending  that  this\r                 \n\ndetermination was error.\n\n          Exempted learned professions  include law,  accounting,\n\nengineering,  architecture, nursing,  and  medicine.   29  C.F.R.\n\n  541.302.   The  Monitor would  have us  add journalism  to this\r                                   \n\nlist, arguing that  most of its  employees had either  journalism\n\ndegrees or liberal arts degrees with an emphasis on writing.\n\n          The learned professional exemption applies to employees\n\nwhose \"primary  duty\" consists of \"[w]ork  requiring knowledge of\n\nan  advance  [sic]  type  in  a  field  of  science  or  learning\n\ncustomarily  acquired  by  a   prolonged  course  of  specialized\n\nintellectual  instruction  and  study, as  distinguished  from  a\n\ngeneral academic education . . . .\"  29 C.F.R.   541.3(a)(1).  As\n\nthe interpretations make clear, \"[t]he word 'customarily' implies\n\nthat in the vast majority of cases the specific academic training\n\nis a prerequisite for  entrance into the profession.\"   29 C.F.R.\n\n  541.302(d).  Further, \"[t]he typical symbol of the professional\n\ntraining  and the best prima facie evidence of its possession is,\n\nof  course,  the  appropriate   academic  degree,  and  in  these\n\nprofessions  an advanced  academic degree  is a standard  (if not\n\nuniversal)  prerequisite.\"    29  C.F.R.    541.302(e)(1).    The\n\ninterpretations specifically  state that the  exemption does  not\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\nencompass \"such quasi-professions as journalism in which the bulk\n\nof the employees  have acquired their skill  by experience rather\n\nthan   by  any  formal  specialized  training.\"     29  C.F.R.   \n\n541.302(d).\n\n          While we acknowledge that these interpretations are not\n\ncontrolling, we join the  substantial number of courts that  have\n\nchosen to follow them on  this issue.  See, e.g.,  Gateway Press,\r                                                                           \n\nInc., 13  F.3d at 698 (holding  that the \"case law  has held that\r              \n\nreporters  do   not  come  within   the  scope  of   the  learned\n\nexemption\");  Sun Publishing  Co. v.

No  particular academic  degree is  a  prerequisite for\n\nentrance  into  the  field  and applicants  are  not  required to\n\ndemonstrate mastery over a  specific body of knowledge.   Rather,\n\nas Dean Bagdikian from  the Graduate School of Journalism  at the\n\nUniversity of  California at  Berkeley testified,  editors hiring\n\nentry-level  journalists are  mainly concerned  with whether  the\n\napplicant's writing samples  demonstrate accuracy,  intelligence,\n\nand an  ability to  write clearly.   Applicants  possessing these\n\nqualities  are the most likely to  absorb the on-the-job training\n\nand  become successful  journalists.   The  importance of  actual\n\nnewspaper  experience  as  opposed   to  journalism  courses   is\n\ndemonstrated  by the  fact that  top-flight newspapers  generally\n\nhire  only  experienced applicants  with  demonstrable journalism\n\nskills.  See  Sherwood, 677 F.  Supp. at 11.   In light of  these\r                                \n\nconsiderations, we agree with the district  court's determination\n\nthat  the journalists  at  The  Monitor  are not  exempt  learned\r                                                 \n\nprofessionals.\n\n            3.

The Monitor tried to highlight the changes\r                                            \n\nin the newspaper business  brought about in the last  forty years\n\nand  explain how these  changes had undermined  the pertinence of\n\nthe Secretary's  interpretations.   The district  court's opinion\n\nmakes  it clear  that  it  simply  did  not  find  this  evidence\n\nsufficient   to   render   the    interpretations   inapplicable.\n\nNewspapers of New England, Inc., 834 F.

The  Monitor  presented little  or no\r                                                  \n\nevidence suggesting that  the employees at  issue fell into  that\n\nminority  of reporters  whose  work was  dependent on  invention,\n\nimagination, or  talent.  The Monitor made no significant attempt\r                                               \n\nto differentiate  the work  of its reporters,  photographers, and\n\neditors  from the  work done  at  every newspaper  throughout the\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\ncountry.   Given this framework, the  district court's admittedly\n\nmeager findings of  fact provide an adequate  basis for appellate\n\nreview.  Between the opinion  and the record, we have garnered  a\n\nthorough understanding of  the proceedings below, and that is all\n\nthat Rule 52(a) requires.\n\n          II.  The Willfulness of the FLSA Violations\r                    II.  The Willfulness of the FLSA Violations\n\n          The  FLSA  imposes  a two-year  statute  of limitations\n\nunless the  violations are shown to  be willful, in which  case a\n\nthree-year period  applies.  29 U.S.C.    255(a).  In the present\n\ncase,  the district court found  that the FLSA  violations at The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor were not willful and thus awarded back wages for only the\r                 \n\ntwo-year  period before the suit was filed rather than the three-\n\nyear period claimed by the Secretary.  The Secretary asserts that\n\nThe  Monitor's FLSA violations  were indeed willful  and that the\r                      \n\ndistrict court's determination to the contrary was in error.\n\n          FLSA violations are willful where the employer \"knew or\n\nshowed reckless disregard  for the matter of whether  its conduct\n\nwas prohibited by the statute.\"  McLaughlin v.

This   is\n            particularly   true   in  light   of  the\n            closeness  of  the findings  in  the more\n            recent  cases  concerning exemptions  for\n            those who write and edit for the media.\n\n                               -45-\r\r\n\nSecretary  did  present plausible  arguments  in  support of  his\n\nposition.  The Secretary argued  that the violations were willful\n\nand could not have been the product of  ignorance because the DOL\n\nexplained the  overtime and recordkeeping provisions  of the FLSA\n\nduring  its 1974 investigation  of the  newspaper.   Further, the\n\nfact  that The  Monitor  paid  its  employees  for  all  reported\r                                 \n\novertime  demonstrates  that  it was  indeed  aware  of the  FLSA\n\novertime requirements.  Additionally, several employees testified\n\nthat they had been instructed by superiors to report no more than\n\nforty hours  on their  weekly  timecards.   Those employees  also\n\ntestified that  they were occasionally reprimanded  when they did\n\nreport  overtime and were told to alter their weekly timecards so\n\nthat no overtime hours would be included.\n\n          In its defense, The Monitor  argued that its policy  of\r                                               \n\ndiscouraging overtime hours while  paying those employees who did\n\nin fact  report them does not  compel the conclusion that  it was\n\nwillfully violating the  FLSA.  Rather, they contended  that this\n\npolicy \"illustrates the efforts  of an employer trying to  do the\n\nright thing in  the face of  hopelessly outdated 40-year-old  DOL\n\njournalism  interpretations which provide  absolutely no guidance\n\nregarding  which journalists in a modern  newsroom are exempt and\n\nwhich are not.\"   In  support of this  contention, The  Monitor's\r                                                                         \n\neditor-in-chief testified that he  had never instructed anyone at\n\nThe Monitor to alter  a timecard, and that  The Monitor paid  its\r                                                                 \n\nemployees  for  all  reported   overtime.

Denial of the Injunction\n\n          The Secretary also appeals the district court's refusal\n\nto prospectively  enjoin The Monitor from  committing future FLSA\r                                              \n\nviolations.   The FLSA authorizes  the district courts  to enjoin\n\nviolations of  the overtime  and recordkeeping provisions  of the\n\nAct.  29 U.S.C.   217.  The issue of whether  an injunction is an\n\nappropriate remedial measure rests in the sound discretion of the\n\ndistrict  court, and  its decision  on this  matter will  only be\n\ndisturbed  on  appeal  where an  abuse  of  discretion is  shown.\n\nMartin  v. Coventry  Fire Dist.,  981 F.2d  1358, 1362  (1st Cir.\r                                         \n\n1992)  (citation omitted).    In exercising  its discretion,  the\n\ndistrict  court  should  weigh   the  finding  of  the  violation\n\nestablished  at  trial  against  the factors  that  indicate  the\n\nviolations  are not likely to  recur, \"such as  intent to comply,\n\nextraordinary   efforts   to  prevent   recurrence,   absence  of\n\nrepetitive violations, and absence of bad faith.\"  Id.\r                                                                \n                    \r                              \n\n19  Again,  we find support from the Third  Circuit's decision in\nReich v. Gateway Press, Inc., 13 F.3d at 702-03.  Confronted with\r                                      \nessentially the same facts as we now face, it refused to overrule\nthe district court's conclusion that the FLSA violations were not\nwillful.  See id.\r                           \n\n                               -47-\r\r\n\n          Reviewing the  record with these factors  in mind leads\n\nus  to the inescapable conclusion that the district court did not\n\nabuse  its discretion in denying the  injunction.  The violations\n\nat The Monitor were not the product of  bad faith.  Nor were they\r                        \n\ncommitted willfully.    Rather, the  violations  can in  part  be\n\ntraced  to the indeterminate status of the FLSA exemptions in the\n\nfield   of   journalism.20     Further,   although   The  Monitor\r                                                                           \n\nsteadfastly  insisted throughout  the trial  and appeal  that the\n\nmajority  of  its  journalists   were  exempt  professionals,  it\n\nrepresented  to  the district  court  that it  fully  intended to\n\ncomply with requirements of the FLSA as clarified by the ultimate\n\njudicial resolution  of this case.   In these  circumstances, the\n\ndenial of the injunction was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n                    \r                              \n\n20   The violations at  issue were committed  in the late 1970's,\nlong before the current case law began to clarify the issue.\n\n                               -48-\r\r\n\n          IV.  Denial of Post-investigation Damages\r                    IV.  Denial of Post-investigation Damages\n\n          As discussed  above, the Secretary sought  to introduce\n\nevidence  and  win  back  wages  for  FLSA  violations  that  had\n\nallegedly occurred  after the DOL concluded  its investigation at\n\nThe Monitor.  The  district court allowed the evidence  pending a\r                     \n\nfinal ruling  on admissibility.   Ultimately, the  court excluded\n\nthe  evidence  and  refused  to  award monetary  relief  for  any\n\nviolations  alleged  to have  occurred  after  January 25,  1980,\n\napproximately  the  last day  of the  period  covered by  the DOL\n\ninvestigation.   With  regard  to this  determination, the  court\n\nstated:\n\n            The reason  for this . .  . limitation is\n            that,    although     plaintiff    claims\n            \"continuing\" violations of FLSA, the case\n            was largely prepared by the defendants on\n            the  ground that violations,  if any, did\n            not  continue  beyond  January 25,  1980.\n            The court, having  taken the matter under\n            advisement, Tr. 1-43, 44, finds and rules\n            that it would  be unjust and  inequitable\n            to  allow damages  to be recovered  for a\n            period beyond January 25, 1980.\n\nNewspapers  of New  England, Inc.,  834 F.

Therefore,  the\n\nSecretary contends, the  district court's  limitation of  damages\n\nwas  an abuse of  discretion.  We disagree.   The record contains\n\nample  support for  the district  court's determination  that The\r                                                                           \n\n                               -49-\r\r\n\nMonitor  was unfairly  surprised  by the  Secretary's attempt  to\r                 \n\nprove post-investigation violations at trial.  Exhibit A attached\n\nto the  Secretary's complaint  accurately detailed the  amount of\n\nback  wages sought for each employee.  Exhibit A did not indicate\n\nthat the claimed wages would be revised at trial to reflect post-\n\ninvestigation violations.21   The  Pre-trial  Order's summary  of\n\nthe Secretary's  claims also  did not reflect  post-investigation\n\ndamages.   Rather, the Pre-trial Order stated that damages sought\n\nby  the  Secretary  were  only  those  contained  in  Exhibit  A.\n\nFurthermore,  the DOL  compliance officer in  charge of  the case\n\nstated  at his deposition that Exhibit A contained all the claims\n\nbeing brought by the  Secretary.  Counsel  for the DOL failed  to\n\nobject  to either  the Pre-trial  Order or  the testimony  of its\n\ncompliance  officer.   The district  court apparently  found that\n\nthis  confluence  of  events  led  The  Monitor  to  conduct  its\r                                                         \n\ndiscovery on the  reasonable belief  that the  Secretary did  not\n\nintend    to   pursue    back   wages    for   post-investigation\n\nviolations.22    We  do  not   find  this  to  be  an   abuse  of\n                    \r                              \n\n21  The  fact that Exhibit A did not  indicate that the Secretary\nwould seek  damages  for  post-investigation  violations  is  not\ndispositive because  the Secretary's complaint did  aver that the\nviolations were ongoing.\n\n22   After  discovery  closed, the  Secretary  sought  to  reopen\ndiscovery to update its back wage computations so that they would\nreflect post-investigation  violations.   Though  the  magistrate\njudge hearing  the motion  ultimately denied it,  the Secretary's\nsupporting arguments are enlightening:\n\n            The sole choice, therefore, for . . . the\n            Court  is whether  the  pay practices  at\n            issue are to be dealt with in one lawsuit\n            or  in  a  series  of lawsuits.    It  is\n\n                               -50-\r\r\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          Affirmed.\r                            \n\n                    \r                              \n\n            Plaintiff's  position that  resolution of\n            all   back  wage   claims  in   a  single\n            litigation would involve less expenditure\n            of  time and money . . . .  Plaintiff is,\n            however, fully prepared  to file a second\n            lawsuit  to protect  its right  to assert\n            its claims  as to unpaid  back wages  for\n            the  period  January   26,  1980  to  the\n            present.\n\nObviously, this  motion notified  The Monitor that  the Secretary\r                                                       \nsought post-investigation damages.  It is equally clear, however,\nthat the Secretary believed  at the time that it would  be forced\nto file a second lawsuit  to secure post-investigation damages if\nthe  motion to reopen discovery was denied.  The Secretary cannot\nnow  prevail  in  arguing  that  the  district  court  abused its\ndiscretion  by  finding  that  The   Monitor  was  understandably\r                                                      \nunprepared at trial to  defend allegations of  post-investigation\nviolations.    The Secretary  should have  either filed  a second\nlawsuit  or objected  to  the magistrate  judge's  denial of  the\nmotion pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 72(a).  The  fact that it did\nneither may not be rectified on appeal.\n\n                               -51-\r\r\n",

These cross appeals require us\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \n\nto  decide  whether  the reporters,  editors,  and  photographers\n\nemployed  by a  small  community newspaper  are  exempt from  the\n\novertime and recordkeeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards\n\nAct of 1938,  29 U.S.C.   201 et seq. (\"FLSA\" or the \"Act\").  The\n\ncase revolves  around whether the  employees at issue  are exempt\n\nunder the \"professional employee\" exemption of    13(a)(1) of the\n\nAct.\n\n          This  case arose  when the  United States  Secretary of\n\nLabor (\"the Secretary\") brought this action against Newspapers of\n\nNew England, Inc. d/b/a The  Concord Monitor (\"The Monitor\"), and\r                                                                    \n\nGeorge  Wilson,  the  newspaper's  publisher,  claiming  that The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor   had  willfully   violated  the  overtime   and  records\r                 \n\nrequirements  of the FLSA  with respect to the  wages it had paid\n\nits reporters, editors, and photographers.  The Monitor's primary\r                                                                 \n\ndefense was that  the FLSA did not cover its  actions because the\n\nemployees at issue  were exempt professionals.  The  Monitor also\r                                                                      \n\nmaintained that  any FLSA violations  it may have  committed were\n\nnot willful.\n\n          The case was tried to the bench.  In an  opinion issued\n\nseven years after the  trial concluded, the court found  that The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor's   newsroom  employees   were   not   entitled  to   the\r                 \n\nprofessional exemption  from the Act's overtime  requirements and\n\nawarded back  wages and  liquidated damages to  twelve employees.\n\nThe court also found,  however, that the violations had  not been\n\ncommitted willfully  and consequently limited the  damages to the\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ntwo-year period before  the filing  of the suit  rather than  the\n\nthree-year period  applicable to  willful violations.   The court\n\nrefused to award damages for violations occurring after the close\n\nof  the  DOL's  compliance   investigation,  and  it  denied  the\n\nSecretary's  request for  a  permanent injunction  against future\n\nviolations.  These cross appeals followed.\n\n          Although the  district court  was inexplicably slow  in\n\nissuing  its  less-than-meticulous  opinion, we  affirm  for  the\n\nreasons that follow.\n\n                        FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r                                  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          The  Monitor is  an award-winning  small-city newspaper\r                                \n\nwith a  daily  circulation in  excess  of 4,000  copies.   It  is\n\npublished in  Concord, New  Hampshire, by the  defendants, George\n\nWilson  and Newspapers  of  New  England,  Inc.    In  1974,  the\n\nDepartment of Labor (\"DOL\")  investigated the newspaper under the\n\nFLSA  and  warned  it  of  possible  overtime  and  recordkeeping\n\nviolations.  Although the DOL did not press charges at that time,\n\nit informed the paper of the relevant FLSA requirements.\n\n          In late 1979 and early 1980, the DOL again investigated\n\nthe pay practices in The  Monitor's newsroom.  This investigation\r                                           \n\nconvinced the DOL that certain newsroom employees were  not being\n\npaid  for  all their  overtime  hours.    Consequently,  the  DOL\n\ncommenced  this litigation.   The newsroom employees  at issue in\n\nthe  Secretary's  action were  reporters, low-level  editors, and\n\nphotographers.\n\n          The  evidence  at  trial  consisted  of  the testimony,\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\neither live or through deposition, of fourteen newsroom employees\n\nand several experts in the field of journalism.\n\n          1.  Newsroom Employees:\r                    1.  Newsroom Employees:\n\n          The  Monitor's  editor-in-chief, Mike  Pride, testified\r                                \n\nthat he requires a college degree  with an emphasis in writing to\n\nwork as a staff writer or editor.  Nevertheless, he conceded that\n\na  journalism degree was not a prerequisite for employment at The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor.  In  fact, Pride and at least one-half  of the reporters\r                 \n\nwho  testified had  degrees in  subjects other  than journalism.2\n\nFor most of The Monitor's reportorial staff, this employment  was\r                                 \n\ntheir first in the field of journalism.\n\n            a.  Staff Writers\r                      a.  Staff Writers\r                                       \n\n          When  hired, The  Monitor's reporters were  assigned to\r                                             \n\ntasks  ranging  from  writing features  to  covering legislative,\n\nmunicipal, and town governments and agencies.  Some of their work\n\nwas of  a routine nature, such  as compiling lists of  the titles\n\nand  times of local showings  of motion pictures.   The reporters\n\ntestified   that  they   worked  essentially   unsupervised,  had\n\nauthority  and discretion  over  what  they  did and  wrote,  and\n\ndecided how  their assignments would be  executed.  Nevertheless,\n\nmost  of them  testified that  their time  was spent  on \"general\n\nassignment\" work and  their writing was  mainly focused on  \"hard\n\nnews.\"\n                    \r                              \n\n2  Of the 32  employees for whom back wages were sought, six held\nMasters  degrees, four of which were in journalism; 16 had earned\nBachelor's degrees;  one employee  held an Associate  degree; one\nhad taken some college  courses; and one had taken  courses at an\ninstitute of photography.\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          For  example,  staff writer  Margaret  Burton testified\n\nthat during her first  year, as an education reporter,  she wrote\n\nabout  education  issues  and  covered the  State  Department  of\n\nEducation as well  as the  meetings of the  local school  boards.\n\nWhen she  was  later assigned  to  cover court  proceedings,  she\n\nreported  \"who was  charged, what  the charges  were and  who the\n\nwitnesses were and what they said.\"\n\n          Sharon Goss testified that  she wrote \"feature stories\"\n\nwhen she first started at the paper.  She described these stories\n\nas having \"more of a  fill the page kind of mentality .  . . than\n\ngo out and  do something  really creative.\"   Ms. Goss  testified\n\nthat  when she  later  became a  regional  reporter, she  covered\n\ngovernment   and  town  planning  meetings,  visited  offices  of\n\nselectmen, called people on the phone about pertinent issues, and\n\nread  through  courthouse  documents  concerning  lawsuits  filed\n\nagainst towns.\n\n          Randall Keith  testified that during his  first year at\n\nThe  Monitor  he  spent  approximately 90  percent  of  his  time\r                      \n\ncovering city hall  and the remainder  covering police and  other\n\ngeneral assignment  stories.   Later, he  split his  time between\n\nbusiness writing and covering the police beat.  He testified that\n\nnone of his  writing was highly  complex and  that it could  have\n\nbeen done by anyone with general training and ability.\n\n            b.  Editors\r                      b.  Editors\r                                 \n\n          Lila  Locksley  testified  that  her  main duties  were\n\nreading wire stories for  grammatical and factual errors, writing\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nheadlines,  and  making improvements  so  that  the stories  were\n\nshorter  or more readable.  She also  performed layout work.  She\n\ntestified that the layout work consisted of editing  the stories,\n\nwriting  headlines, sizing photographs,  and writing the captions\n\nthat appeared beneath the photographs.\n\n          Nancy  Druelinger  offered  similar testimony,  stating\n\nthat most of her  time was spent writing headlines,  reading over\n\nand rewriting wire  stories, and laying out the pages.   She also\n\nstated that  it was  her responsibility  to decide  which stories\n\nwould appear in  the paper.  She  testified that she  thought her\n\nduties as an editor required imagination, creativity, and talent.\n\nShe  stated that decisions with  regard to legal  issues (such as\n\nwhether   a   story  was   potentially   libelous),  taste,   and\n\nnewsworthiness were all within her discretion.\n\n            c.  Photographers\r                      c.  Photographers\r                                       \n\n          Photographer Tom  Sobolik testified that 70  percent of\n\nhis work was assigned and that he had no input as to which photos\n\nwould be used in  the newspaper.  While Mr.  Sobolik acknowledged\n\nthat  there are  creative aspects  to photojournalism,  he stated\n\nthat  \"a large  proportion of  it is  pretty run-of-the-mill  and\n\npretty standardized.\"\n\n          Throughout the relevant period, Ken Williams spent most\n\nof  his   time  shooting  sports,  exteriors   and  interiors  of\n\nbuildings,  and politicians.   Mr.  Williams testified  that more\n\nthan 50 percent of his time was spent in the developing of photos\n\nin  the darkroom.  In Mr. William's opinion, \"there's very little\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nnews photography which is art\" because \"a news photographer tries\n\nto  photograph reality,  as  it  happens, without  embellishment,\n\nwithout taking sides.\"\n\n          2.   The Experts' Testimony\r                    2.   The Experts' Testimony\n\n          The  Secretary   offered  the  testimony   of  Ben   H.\n\nBagdikian,  Dean of  the  Graduate School  of  Journalism at  the\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley (\"Dean Bagdikian\").  In Dean\n\nBagdikian's  opinion, the majority of journalists do not meet the\n\nqualifications  for  professional  exemption  from  the  overtime\n\nprovisions  of the  FLSA.  He  distinguished journalism  from the\n\ntraditional professions, such as law and medicine, in which there\n\nis  an  accumulated body  of knowledge  and  a canon  which every\n\npractitioner is required  to know.   He stated  that there is  no\n\nbody of scholarly  work which  a journalist is  required to  know\n\nbefore he may practice.   Rather, a journalist must  be a skilled\n\nand accurate observer, have  good judgment, and be able  to write\n\nclearly.\n\n          Dean Bagdikian also testified  that journalism is not a\n\nfield in  which the employee's work product  depends primarily on\n\ninvention,  imagination,  or  talent.   In  his  view,  the  vast\n\nmajority of newspaper reporting centers around clear, disciplined\n\nobservation of public  events and people.   He further  testified\n\nthat although there have been significant and substantial changes\n\nin the field of journalism, these changes do not warrant changing\n\nthe  definition  of  professional  or  changing  the  Secretary's\n\nposition regarding employees in the field of journalism.\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          The  Monitor  offered  the testimony  of  Robert  Neale\r                                \n\nCopple,  Dean of the College  of Journalism at  the University of\n\nNebraska at Lincoln (\"Dean Copple\").  Dean Copple  testified that\n\nthe current field of  journalism is vastly different than  it was\n\nin the 1940's.  He  pointed out that nearly 90 percent  of modern\n\njournalists have  college degrees.   In comparison,  he estimated\n\nthat only 30  percent of  newsroom employees in  the 1940's  were\n\ncollege  graduates.  He further testified that, on the whole, the\n\njournalism  done by  the staff  at The  Monitor was  creative and\r                                                         \n\nthought-provoking, requiring both imagination and talent.\n\n          3.  The Monitor's Overtime Policy\r                    3.  The Monitor's Overtime Policy\r                                   \n\n          Coverage of  legislative sessions and  meetings of  the\n\ncity council often  caused the reporters assigned to these events\n\nto  work more than forty hours weekly.  Although weekly timecards\n\nwere   collected  for   each  newsroom   employee,  The   Monitor\r                                                                           \n\ndiscouraged overtime,  and suggested  that those who  worked more\n\nthan  40 hours should seek compensatory time in lieu of overtime.\n\nThat is, they were supposed to work fewer hours on the other days\n\nof  the week  to reduce their  total weekly  hours to  forty.  At\n\nleast three of the witnesses who testified had been told by their\n\nsuperiors  to alter the time cards submitted to reduce the amount\n\nof  overtime hours  originally listed  therein.   Those employees\n\nalso testified that they  were occasionally reprimanded when they\n\ndid report overtime and  told to alter their weekly  timecards so\n\nthat no overtime hours would be included.\n\n          On  other occasions,  time cards  for a  given employee\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nwere  completed by  a co-employee, who  necessarily did  not have\n\naccurate  information  as to  the  actual  hours worked  by  that\n\nemployee.   In light of these circumstances, many of the newsroom\n\nemployees did not bother  to prepare and file an  accurate record\n\nof all hours, including overtime, worked weekly.\n\n          Employees  did receive the compensation required by the\n\nFLSA  for the overtime hours that they actually recorded on their\n\nweekly time  cards.   Mike Pride, The  Monitor's editor-in-chief,\r                                                        \n\ntestified that  it was The Monitor's policy  to pay overtime.  He\r                                            \n\nstated that overtime  was to be  authorized in advance,  whenever\n\npossible,  but  that  the   overtime  was  always  paid,  whether\n\nauthorized or unauthorized.  Mr. Pride testified that this policy\n\nexisted to control the cost of overtime.\n\n                      PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                                PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n          On  June 22,  1981, the  Secretary brought  this action\n\nagainst  The   Monitor,  and   George  Wilson,   the  newspaper's\r                                \n\npublisher.  The  complaint alleged that, since February  4, 1978,\n\nthe newspaper  had committed  willful violations of  the overtime\n\nand  recordkeeping  provisions  of   the  FLSA,  and  that  these\n\nviolations  were continuing.   The  Secretary sought  a permanent\n\ninjunction against  the violations, and  an award of  back wages,\n\nalong with  interest and  liquidated damages.   Additionally, the\n\nSecretary claimed that three years of back  pay were appropriate,\n\nrather than the normal two, because The Monitor's FLSA violations\r                                                         \n\nhad been willful under 29 U.S.C.   255(a).\n\n          In  its  answer,  The  Monitor  denied  the Secretary's\r                                                  \n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nallegations  and  asserted as  an  affirmative  defense that  the\n\nemployees were exempt from the applicable regulations of the Act,\n\nthat any violation was the  result of good faith reliance on  the\n\nDepartment's \"interpretations and/or past rulings,\" and  that the\n\nclaims were time barred.\n\n          The case  was tried to  the bench.  With  regard to the\n\nalleged FLSA  violations at The Monitor,  the Secretary presented\r                                                 \n\nthe testimony  of Department of Labor  (\"DOL\") Compliance Officer\n\nScott  Wilkinson,  and  thirteen  reporters,  photographers,  and\n\neditors  employed  by The  Monitor.   Throughout  the  trial, the\r                                            \n\nSecretary  denied The  Monitor's  claim that  its employees  were\r                                        \n\nexempt  professionals.   For  over  forty  years the  Secretary's\n\nposition,  set forth in non-binding departmental interpretations,\n\nhad  been  that  the  majority  of  journalists  are  not  exempt\n\nprofessionals under  the FLSA.   The Secretary stood  behind this\n\nposition  and  presented expert  testimony  in support  of  it at\n\ntrial.    The  Secretary   also  attempted  to  present  employee\n\ntestimony concerning  alleged  FLSA violations  occurring at  The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor after January 26, 1980, the last day covered by the DOL's\r                 \n\ninvestigation.   The Monitor objected to  this testimony, arguing\r                                      \n\nthat the Secretary could not enlarge its claims  without amending\n\nits  complaint.    The   district  court  allowed  the  proffered\n\ntestimony  but  reserved a  final ruling  on  the matter  for its\n\nopinion.\n\n          In its  defense, The Monitor primarily  argued that the\r                                                \n\nSecretary's   forty-year-old   journalism  interpretations   were\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nobsolete  and  did not  reflect  the rigors  and  complexities of\n\nmodern  journalism.  The Monitor  moved the court  to declare the\r                                          \n\ninterpretations  null and  void  and hold  that  the majority  of\n\nmodern journalists  qualify  as exempt  professionals  under  the\n\nFLSA.  As a fallback position, The Monitor contended, albeit less\r                                                    \n\nvigorously,   that  its   employees  were   exempt  professionals\n\nregardless  of  whether  the  court  overturned  the  Secretary's\n\ninterpretations.    The Monitor  also  maintained  that any  FLSA\r                                         \n\nviolations it may have committed were not willful.\n\n          Although the trial was  completed in 1986, the district\n\ncourt  did  not  issue  its  opinion  and  final  judgment  until\n\nNovember 3,  1993.3  The court found  that The Monitor's newsroom\r                                                                \n                    \r                              \n\n3   The Monitor contends  that the  seven year delay  between the\r                         \ntwo-week  trial and  the decision  constitutes  reversible error.\nThis type of delay,  particularly in light of the  sparse factual\nfindings,  concerns us.   Not  only does  it affect  the parties'\nrights to a speedy adjudication of their claims, it detracts from\nthe public perception of the judicial  system.  Nevertheless, The\r                                                                           \nMonitor has failed  to enlighten us as  to how the delay  damaged\r                 \nthe  credibility of  the district  court's findings  or otherwise\nprejudiced  The Monitor.  We are in agreement with the sentiments\r                                 \nexpressed  by the  Ninth  Circuit while  contemplating a  similar\ndelay:\n\n            We are appalled by  the delay, but we are\n            aware  of no case holding that a district\n            court commits reversible error  by taking\n            too long  to decide  a case.   Indeed, we\n            doubt that appellate review could ever be\n            an effective means of  enforcing district\n            court  timeliness. .  .  . To  vacate and\n            remand  a  decision  which  the  district\n            court  has  spent several  years crafting\n            hardly seems  a sensible means  to reduce\n            delay.   To reverse  the decision on  the\n            ground  of  delay  would  require  us  to\n            presume    that   lengthy    deliberation\n            inevitably  leads  to  mistake.  .   .  .\n            Although  we  do  not  condone  the  long\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nemployees were not entitled to the professional exemption of  the\n\nAct's overtime requirements and awarded back wages and liquidated\n\ndamages to twelve employees.   However, the court found  that the\n\nviolations had  not  been committed  willfully  and  consequently\n\nlimited the damages to  the two-year period before the  filing of\n\nthe suit  rather than the three-year period applicable to willful\n\nviolations.  The  court refused to  award damages for  violations\n\noccurring after the close  of the DOL's compliance investigation,\n\nand it denied the Secretary's  request for a permanent injunction\n\nagainst future violations.\n\n          In   finding  that  the   employees  were   not  exempt\n\nprofessionals,  the court  relied  on the  Secretary's journalism\n\ninterpretations as persuasive  authority.  These  interpretations\n\nstate in pertinent part:\n\n            Newspaper  writing  of  the  exempt  type\n            must,   therefore,    be   'predominantly\n            original  and   creative  in  character.'\n            Only   writing   which   is   analytical,\n            interpretative  or highly  individualized\n            is considered to be creative in nature. .\n            .   .      Newspaper   writers   commonly\n            performing  work  which  is original  and\n            creative  within the  meaning of    541.3\n            are   editorial    writers,   columnists,\n            critics,  and   'top-flight'  writers  of\n            analytical and interpretative articles.\n\n            (2) The reporting of news,  the rewriting\n                    \r                              \n\n            delay,  we  are  not  willing  to  assume\n            without  strong independent  support that\n            the  district  court  departed  from  its\n            proper  role  and  considered   only  the\n            evidence that was easiest to recall.\n\nPhonetele,  Inc. v.

Rather, the  court accepted  the interpretations  as\n\npersuasive authority  of how to apply  the professional exemption\n\nin  the  field  of  journalism.    Once  credited  as  persuasive\n\nauthority, the  Secretary's interpretations  all but decided  the\n\nexemption issues.   The Monitor presented  little or no  evidence\r                                         \n\nsuggesting    that    its   employees    performed   \"analytical,\n\ninterpretative  or  highly individualized\"  work.    Nor did  The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor   aver  that  its   reporters  were  \"editorial  writers,\r                 \n\ncolumnists, critics,  and 'top-flight' writers  of analytical and\n\ninterpretative  articles.\"    The  Monitor  made  no  significant\r                                                    \n\nattempt   to   differentiate   the   work   of   its   reporters,\n\nphotographers, and editors from the work done  at every newspaper\n\nthroughout the country.   The Monitor's trial strategy hinged  on\r                                               \n\nits dogmatic attempt  to debunk the Secretary's  interpretations,\n\nand  when this failed, its chances of prevailing on the exemption\n\nissues dwindled.\n                    \r                              \n\n4   On October 9,  1992, the interpretive  regulations, 29 C.F.R.\n  541.301,  541.302  and  541.303,  were   redesignated,  without\nchange,   as  29   C.F.R.      541.300,   541.301  and   541.302,\nrespectively.    57 Fed.

The\r                                    \n\nSecretary  appealed  the   district  court's  finding  concerning\n\nwillfulness, its refusal  to issue an injunction, and its refusal\n\nto  award damages for violations occurring after the close of the\n\nDOL's   compliance  investigation.

The  relevant\n\ninterpretations are set forth at 29 C.F.R.   541.301, 541.302 and\n\n541.303.  The regulation enumerates several types of professional\n\nexemptions,  two  of  which  are  relevant  here:  the  so-called\n\n\"learned professional\" and \"artistic professional\" exemptions.\n\n            1.  The Learned Professional Exemption\r                      1.  The Learned Professional Exemption\n\n          The   learned   professional   exemption   deals   with\n\noccupations   which   have  specific   educational  requirements,\n\nincluding  law,  accounting, engineering,  architecture, nursing,\n\nand medicine.

The regulation states that  this exemption\n\napplies  to employees  whose \"primary  duty\" consists  of \"[w]ork\n\nrequiring  knowledge of  an  advance [sic]  type  in a  field  of\n\nscience or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nspecialized  intellectual instruction and study, as distinguished\n\nfroma general academic education. . . .\" 29 C.F.R.   541.3(a)(1).\n\n          The    interpretations    state   that    \"[t]he   word\n\n'customarily'  implies that  in the  vast majority  of  cases the\n\nspecific academic  training is  a prerequisite for  entrance into\n\nthe  profession.\"   29  C.F.R.    541.302(d).   Moreover,  \"[t]he\n\ntypical symbol of  the professional training  and the best  prima\n\nfacie evidence of  its possession is, of course,  the appropriate\n\nacademic degree,  and in  these professions an  advanced academic\n\ndegree is a standard (if not universal) prerequisite.\"  29 C.F.R.\n\n   541.302(e)(1).  The  interpretations specifically declare that\n\nthe  exemption  does  not  encompass  \"such  quasi-professions as\n\njournalism in which the bulk of the employees have acquired their\n\nskill  by  experience  rather  than  by  any  formal  specialized\n\ntraining.\"    29  C.F.R.    541.302(d).    Further,  \"[n]ewspaper\n\nwriters,  with   possible  rare  exceptions  in   certain  highly\n\ntechnical fields,  do not meet the  requirements of   541.3(a)(1)\n\nfor exemption  as professional employees of  the 'learned' type.\"\n\n29 C.F.R.   541.303(f)(1).\n\n            2.  The Artistic Professional Exemption\r                      2.  The Artistic Professional Exemption\n\n          The artistic exemption applies to professionals working\n\nin a \"recognized field of artistic endeavor.\"  29 C.F.R.   541.3.\n\nExempt  artistic  professionals  may  be found  in  many  fields,\n\nincluding  music,  writing,  the  theater, and  the  plastic  and\n\ngraphic arts.\n\n          The  regulation outlines both a short and long test for\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\ndetermining  whether   an  employee  qualifies  as   an  artistic\n\nprofessional.  The  long test  is applied to  employees who  earn\n\nweekly salaries of  at least $170 but less than  $250.  The short\n\ntest is used for  employees whose weekly salary is  not less than\n\n$250.5   Both  tests demand  that the  employee's \"primary  duty\"\n\nconsist  of  work requiring  \"invention,  imagination, or  talent\n\n. . . .\"   29 C.F.R.   541.3.   The long test  also requires that\n\nthe employee's primary  duty consist of \"[w]ork that  is original\n\nand creative in character . . . .\"  29 C.F.R.   541.3(a)(2).\n\n          The interpretations state that \"[o]nly writing which is\n\nanalytical,  interpretive or highly  individualized is considered\n\nto  be creative  in nature.  .  . .   Newspaper  writers commonly\n\nperforming work which is original and creative within the meaning\n\nof   541.3 are editorial writers, columnists,  critics, and 'top-\n\nflight'  writers of  analytical and  interpretive articles.\"   29\n\nC.F.R.    541.303(f)(1).     With   regard  to   the  \"invention,\n\nimagination,    or    talent\"   requirement,    the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation says:\n\n            In the case  of newspaper employees,  the\n            distinction  here  is   similar  to   the\n            distinction observed . . .  in connection\n            with  the  requirement that  the  work be\n            \"original  and  creative  in  character.\"\n            Obviously  the  majority of  reporters do\n            work    which   depends    primarily   on\n            intelligence,  diligence,  and  accuracy.\n                    \r                              \n\n5  As the Third Circuit noted, \"[t]he short test was added to the\nFLSA in 1949 in large part because the DOL felt that salary level\nturned out to be  a good proxy for determination  of professional\nstatus.\"   Gateway Press, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660190\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/660190/robert-reich-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">698</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">n.16.

The  parties\n\nvigorously dispute what weight, if any, courts  should give these\n\ninterpretations when they apply the regulation.  The Monitor asks\r                                                                      \n\nus to declare that  the interpretations are obsolete  and invalid\n\nbecause they do not reflect the complexities and rigors of modern\n\njournalism.  The Secretary  contends that the interpretations are\n\nstill  highly  relevant because  the  technological  and societal\n\nchanges of the last  forty years have not altered  the day-to-day\n\nduties of the majority of reporters.\n\n          This is the central issue on appeal.  Once the district\n\ncourt  accepted  them  as persuasive  authority,  the Secretary's\n\ninterpretations were  nearly conclusive on the  exemption issues.\n\nThe  Monitor made  a  less extensive  effort  to prove  that  its\r                      \n\nemployees   performed   \"analytical,  interpretative   or  highly\n\nindividualized\" work.  The Monitor made no significant attempt to\r                                            \n\ndifferentiate  the  work  of  its  reporters,  photographers, and\n\neditors  from the  work done  at every  newspaper throughout  the\n\ncountry.  Therefore, in light of The Monitor's trial strategy, if\r                                                      \n\nwe  decline to  invalidate  the  journalism interpretations,  the\n\nrecord  will almost certainly  compel us  to affirm  the district\n\ncourt's decision on the exemption issues.\n\n          As   we   noted   above,   although   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretations are not controlling, courts may refer to them for\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nguidance.

The short test  is used for  employees whose  weekly\n\nsalary is not less than $250.\n\n          Although the  long  test has  many requirements,10  the\n                    \r                              \n\n10    The  long test  exempts  as  an  artistic professional  any\nemployee:\n\n            (a)  Whose primary  duty consists  of the\n            performance of:\n                              . . .\n            Work that  is  original and  creative  in\n            character  in  a   recognized  field   of\n            artistic  endeavor  (as  opposed to  work\n            which can be produced by a person endowed\n            with   general  manual   or  intellectual\n            ability and training),  and the result of\n            which depends primarily on the invention,\n            imagination, or talent  of the  employee;\n            and\n\n            (b)  Whose  work requires  the consistent\n            exercise  of  discretion and  judgment in\n            its performance;  and\n\n            (c)    Whose   work    is   predominantly\n            intellectual and varied in  character (as\n            opposed   to   routine  mental,   manual,\n            mechanical, or  physical work) and  is of\n            such character that  the output  produced\n            or  the  result  accomplished  cannot  be\n            standardized  in  relation  to   a  given\n            period of time; and\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nmost  significant for  our analysis are  that (1)  the employee's\n\nprimary  duty consist of \"[w]ork that is original and creative in\n\ncharacter in  a recognized field  of artistic  endeavor\" and  (2)\n\n\"the  result  of  which   depends  primarily  on  the  invention,\n\nimagination, or  talent of the  employee . .  . .\"   29 C.F.R.   \n\n541.3(a)(2); see Gateway Press, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660190\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/660190/robert-reich-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\r                                              \n\n          The short  test for determining whether  an employee is\n\nexempt as an artistic  professional is more simple.

The Monitor claims that this was reversible error because\r                             \n\nthe district court erroneously required these employees to meet a\n\nmuch more difficult standard.\n\n          The district  court's opinion suggests that  it did not\n\nspecifically apply  the  short test  to  those employees  of  The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor  with weekly salaries above $250.  However, as we discuss\r                 \n\nbelow,  our  review of  the record  against  the backdrop  of the\n\nSecretary's interpretations leads us to conclude that these three\n\nemployees do  not qualify as exempt  artistic professionals, even\n\nunder  the short  test.   Therefore, even  if the  district court\n\nerroneously  applied  the \"original  and  creative in  character\"\n\nrequirement of the long test, this error was harmless.\n\n          The  relevant portion of the  short test requires us to\n\ndetermine (1) the employee's \"primary duty,\" and  (2) whether the\n\nperformance  of  that duty  requires \"invention,  imagination, or\n\ntalent.\"  Because the  Secretary stipulated that writing  was the\n\nprimary  duty of  these employees,  the  only issue  remaining is\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nwhether   their  writing  required  \"invention,  imagination,  or\n\ntalent.\"    With  regard  to  the  \"invention,   imagination,  or\n\ntalent\" requirement, the Secretary's interpretation says:\n\n            In the case  of newspaper employees,  the\n            distinction  here  is   similar  to   the\n            distinction observed . . .  in connection\n            with  the  requirement that  the  work be\n            \"original  and  creative  in  character.\"\n            Obviously  the  majority of  reporters do\n            work    which   depends    primarily   on\n            intelligence,  diligence,  and  accuracy.\n            It is  the  minority whose  work  depends\n            primarily on  \"invention, imagination, or\n            talent.\"\n\n29 C.F.R.   541.303.11  The  district court found, and we  agree,\n\nthat The Monitor employees did not fulfill this requirement.\r                          \n\n          The record  demonstrates that the  day-to-day duties of\n\nthese three reporters consisted primarily of \"general assignment\"\n\nwork.  Among other things,  their stories covered public  utility\n\ncommission hearings; criminal and police activity; city and state\n                    \r                              \n\n11  We follow the reasoning of the Third Circuit's Gateway Press,\r                                                                           \nInc.  opinion and  reject the  argument that  the interpretations\r              \nonly apply to the long test:\n\n            \"Although  this   interpretation  of  the\n            phrase   'invention,   imagination,    or\n            talent' seems  to refer to the  phrase as\n            it is used in [the long test] rather than\n            as it is used  in [the short test], there\n            is nothing  to suggest that such a phrase\n            has  a  different  meaning  in   the  two\n            different   parts  of   the  regulations.\n            Indeed,   as   a   matter  of   statutory\n            construction,  where one word  is used in\n            one   place,  it  should  have  the  same\n            meaning  in  another  place in  the  same\n            statute . . .

The field of newspaper writing\n\nis  certainly a medium capable of sustaining creativity.  We want\n\nto reiterate  that whether an employee is  an exempt professional\n\nis  independent  of  the  title  the  employer  ascribes  to  the\n\nposition.

The determination of whether the exemption applies to a\n\ngiven employee depends on the specific duties and characteristics\n\nrequired  by the position rather than its actual title.  However,\n\n\"if we were to find that [these] reporters are in the minority of\n\nreporters whose  work requires invention, imagination, or talent,\n\nit is  hard to see what reporters would be left in the majority.\"\n\nGateway  Press, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660190\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/660190/robert-reich-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  at  <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">;  cf.

Staff Writers:\n\n          With regard  to the  staff writers salaried  below $250\n\nper week, their day-to-day  responsibilities were very similar to\n\nthose of the staff  writers discussed above.  For  example, staff\n\nwriter  Margaret  Burton  testified  that three  fourths  of  her\n\nstories  covered hard news, such as the proceedings of the school\n\nboard, educational issues, trials and court hearings, as  well as\n\nthe  legislative hearings.  She estimated that only one fourth of\n\nher  writing  constituted  feature  writing   requiring  in-depth\n\ninterpretation or analysis.\n\n          Staff writer  Sharon  Goss testified  that  during  her\n                    \r                              \n\nexempt and non-exempt work in the field of journalism.\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nfirst year at the paper, she spent approximately sixty percent of\n\nher time writing what  she called feature stories.  The topics of\n\nthese  stories were  usually  assigned by  an editor,  and rarely\n\ndemanded  the  imagination,  interpretation,  or  invention  that\n\ncharacterizes exempt  newspaper writing.14   The remaining  forty\n\npercent was  divided between \"deadline work\"  and clerical tasks,\n\nsuch  as  compiling  local movie  listings.    During the  latter\n\nportion  of her tenure at The Monitor, as an educational reporter\r                                               \n\nand  a  regional reporter,  she  covered  educational issues  and\n\ngovernment and town planning meetings.\n\n          Staff writer Randall Keith testified that the vast bulk\n\nof his first year at The  Monitor was spent working the city hall\r                                           \n\nbeat.   His second year  was divided between  covering the police\n\nbeat and  business  writing.   His  third  year was  spent  as  a\n\nregional  reporter,   covering  town  meetings   and  activities.\n\nOverall,  he described his day  to day duties  as being primarily\n\nthe type of  general assignment work which could  be accomplished\n\nby anyone with general intellectual training and ability.\n\n          As these  examples make clear,  the employees  salaried\n\nbelow $250  had substantially the same  responsibilities as those\n\nreporters,   discussed   above,   with   salaries   above   $250.\n\nConsequently, we find  that the record contains ample support for\n\nthe  district court's  conclusion that  these reporters  were not\n\n                    \r                              \n\n14  For instance, one story reported on the local attitude toward\nthe rising price  of hamburgers.   Another story, on a  local man\nwho had just opened  an art store, centered on  his business, his\ngoods, and whether he thought it would succeed.\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nperforming  the  type of  work that  would  qualify them  for the\n\nartistic  professional exemption.    Rather,  like their  higher-\n\nsalaried counterparts,  they were like the  majority of reporters\n\nin that their work \"depends primarily on intelligence, diligence,\n\nand accuracy.\"  They were not performing duties which would place\n\nthem in  that minority of reporters \"whose work depends primarily\n\non 'invention, imaging [sic], or talent.'\"\n\n            ii.  Photographers:\r                      ii.  Photographers:\n\n          We  also  find ample  support  in  the record  for  the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the photographers at The Monitor\r                                                                           \n\nwere not performing exempt work.   Staff photographer Tom Sobolik\n\ntestified that most of his film  was shot at sporting events.  He\n\nalso listened to the police radio and photographed any newsworthy\n\nevents  it   reported,  including   auto  accidents  and   fires.\n\nApproximately seventy  percent of  Tom Sobolik's  photography was\n\nassigned.  Further,  he testified  that although  there are  some\n\ncreative aspects to his photography, \"a large proportion of it is\n\npretty run of the mill and pretty standardized.\"\n\n          Ken  Williams  testified  that  he spent  most  of  his\n\npicture-shooting time photographing  sporting events, the  pet of\n\nthe week,  interiors and exteriors of  buildings, press meetings,\n\nand meetings with the Governor.  He also spent a  large amount of\n\ntime in the  darkroom developing  the pictures he  and the  other\n\nphotographers had shot.   He conceded that the darkroom  work and\n\nthe  majority of his photography did not, in his mind, constitute\n\nartistic work.\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\n          The  testimony  of these  photographers  indicates that\n\nthey, like the  staff writers,  were not performing  the type  of\n\nphotographic  work which  would qualify  them under  the artistic\n\nexemption.15\n\n            iii.  Editors:\r                      iii.  Editors:\n\n          The Monitor asserts that the district court erroneously\r                               \n\nruled that  three editors were not  exempt artistic professionals\n\nunder  the long test despite the Secretary's concession that they\n\nwere  exempt under the short  test.  Because  this contention has\n\nabsolutely no basis in the record, we reject it.\n\n          Admittedly,  the  Secretary  concluded  that  the three\n\neditors  at issue  --  Sharon Goss,  Nancy  Druelinger, and  Lila\n\nLocksley  -- qualified  for  exemption once  their salaries  rose\n\nabove  $250.  Having so concluded, however, the Secretary did not\n\npursue,  and the court did  not award, back  wages for the period\n\nduring  which  these  employees were  paid  over  $250 per  week.\n\nRather,  the court  concluded that  before their  weekly salaries\n\nrose  above $250,  these editors  were not  performing work  that\n\nqualified  them for  exemption under the  long test  for artistic\n\nprofessionals,16 which requires  that their primary  duty consist\n                    \r                              \n\n15   The  Monitor contends  that  the district  court erroneously\r                           \napplied  the long test to  Ken Williams, whose  weekly salary was\nabove $250.  The opinion does not conclusively indicate what test\nwas  applied to  Ken Williams.   Nevertheless,  we find  that the\nerror, if indeed there was one, was harmless.  The work performed\nby  Mr.  Williams did  not  require  \"invention, imagination,  or\ntalent,\" and thus is not exempt, even under the short test.\n\n16  The Monitor's  brief suggests that there is  an inconsistency\r                         \nbetween the  Secretary's decision  not to pursue  back wages  for\neditors paid over $250 per week and the district court's decision\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\nof \"[w]ork that is original and creative in character\" and \"which\n\ndepends primarily on the invention, imagination, or talent of the\n\nemployee . . . .\"  29 C.F.R.   541.3(a)(2).\n\n          We find this  conclusion to have  ample support in  the\n\nrecord.  Ms. Locksley testified that her main duties were reading\n\nwire  stories  for   grammatical  and  factual   errors,  writing\n\nheadlines,  and  making improvements  so  that  the stories  were\n\nshorter  or  more  readable.    Ms.  Druelinger  offered  similar\n\ntestimony,  stating  that most  of  her  time was  spent  writing\n\nheadlines, reading  over and  rewriting wire stories,  and laying\n\nout  the   pages.17     Ms.  Goss's  testimony   was  comparable.\n\nOverall, their day-to-day work was the type of  routine editorial\n\nwork  that is generally considered  non-exempt.  See  29 C.F.R.  \r                                                              \n\n541.303(f)  (The  reporting of  news,  the  rewriting of  stories\n\nreceived from various sources, or the routine editorial work of a\n\nnewspaper is not predominantly original and creative in character\n\nwithin the meaning of   541.3 and must be considered as nonexempt\n\nwork.).\n                    \r                              \n\nthat the lower paid editors  were not exempt under the long  test\nfor artistic  professionals.  Once  again, The Monitor  is wrong.\r                                                                \nThe Secretary determined that the higher paid editors were exempt\nunder the executive  exemption 29 C.F.R.   541.1 -- not the short\ntest for artistic professionals.\n\n17   Admittedly,  layout and  page design  can qualify  under the\nartistic  professional   exemption.    In  fact,   the  Secretary\nconcluded  that  Tom Chants,  an editor  at  The Monitor,  was an\r                                                                  \nexempt artistic professional.  However,  as Druelinger testified,\nChants's work was considerably different  from the work that she,\nMs.  Locksley, and Ms.  Goss performed:  \"Tom  Chants, he did the\nbeautiful art work pages.   He was able to take lots of  time and\ndid not  do the breaking  news.  He  did the beautiful  features,\nlayouts and fill.  He had a lot more time to do his pages.\"\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\n            2.  The Learned Professional Exemption\r                      2.  The Learned Professional Exemption\n\n          The  district  court  also   held  that  The  Monitor's\r                                                                         \n\njournalists  did  not  qualify  under  the  learned  professional\n\nexemption of 29 C.F.R.   541.3.  In  a footnote to its brief, The\r                                                                           \n\nMonitor  joins  its  amici  supporters in  contending  that  this\r                 \n\ndetermination was error.\n\n          Exempted learned professions  include law,  accounting,\n\nengineering,  architecture, nursing,  and  medicine.   29  C.F.R.\n\n  541.302.   The  Monitor would  have us  add journalism  to this\r                                   \n\nlist, arguing that  most of its  employees had either  journalism\n\ndegrees or liberal arts degrees with an emphasis on writing.\n\n          The learned professional exemption applies to employees\n\nwhose \"primary  duty\" consists of \"[w]ork  requiring knowledge of\n\nan  advance  [sic]  type  in  a  field  of  science  or  learning\n\ncustomarily  acquired  by  a   prolonged  course  of  specialized\n\nintellectual  instruction  and  study, as  distinguished  from  a\n\ngeneral academic education . . . .\"  29 C.F.R.   541.3(a)(1).  As\n\nthe interpretations make clear, \"[t]he word 'customarily' implies\n\nthat in the vast majority of cases the specific academic training\n\nis a prerequisite for  entrance into the profession.\"   29 C.F.R.\n\n  541.302(d).  Further, \"[t]he typical symbol of the professional\n\ntraining  and the best prima facie evidence of its possession is,\n\nof  course,  the  appropriate   academic  degree,  and  in  these\n\nprofessions  an advanced  academic degree  is a standard  (if not\n\nuniversal)  prerequisite.\"    29  C.F.R.    541.302(e)(1).    The\n\ninterpretations specifically  state that the  exemption does  not\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\nencompass \"such quasi-professions as journalism in which the bulk\n\nof the employees  have acquired their skill  by experience rather\n\nthan   by  any  formal  specialized  training.\"     29  C.F.R.   \n\n541.302(d).\n\n          While we acknowledge that these interpretations are not\n\ncontrolling, we join the  substantial number of courts that  have\n\nchosen to follow them on  this issue.

Supp. 1109,  1154-55  (S.D.N.Y. 1993)  (In  holding that  the\n\nbroadcast journalists  were not exempt learned professionals, the\n\ncourt  noted  that journalism  interpretations  remain persuasive\n\ndespite their age because, inter alia, \"experience and on-the-job\r                                               \n\ntraining  still play  a  substantial  role  in  the  training  of\n\njournalists . . . .\").\n\n          In  upholding the  district  court's finding  that  the\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\njournalists  at  The Monitor  do  not qualify  under  the learned\r                                      \n\nprofessional exemption,  we note that  many experts in  the field\n\nbelieve  that journalism  can  only be  learned  in the  newsroom\n\nitself.   No  particular academic  degree is  a  prerequisite for\n\nentrance  into  the  field  and applicants  are  not  required to\n\ndemonstrate mastery over a  specific body of knowledge.   Rather,\n\nas Dean Bagdikian from  the Graduate School of Journalism  at the\n\nUniversity of  California at  Berkeley testified,  editors hiring\n\nentry-level  journalists are  mainly concerned  with whether  the\n\napplicant's writing samples  demonstrate accuracy,  intelligence,\n\nand an  ability to  write clearly.   Applicants  possessing these\n\nqualities  are the most likely to  absorb the on-the-job training\n\nand  become successful  journalists.   The  importance of  actual\n\nnewspaper  experience  as  opposed   to  journalism  courses   is\n\ndemonstrated  by the  fact that  top-flight newspapers  generally\n\nhire  only  experienced applicants  with  demonstrable journalism\n\nskills.  See  Sherwood, 677 F.  Supp. at 11.   In light of  these\r                                \n\nconsiderations, we agree with the district  court's determination\n\nthat  the journalists  at  The  Monitor  are not  exempt  learned\r                                                 \n\nprofessionals.\n\n            3.

The Secretary argued  that the violations were willful\n\nand could not have been the product of  ignorance because the DOL\n\nexplained the  overtime and recordkeeping provisions  of the FLSA\n\nduring  its 1974 investigation  of the  newspaper.   Further, the\n\nfact  that The  Monitor  paid  its  employees  for  all  reported\r                                 \n\novertime  demonstrates  that  it was  indeed  aware  of the  FLSA\n\novertime requirements.  Additionally, several employees testified\n\nthat they had been instructed by superiors to report no more than\n\nforty hours  on their  weekly  timecards.   Those employees  also\n\ntestified that  they were occasionally reprimanded  when they did\n\nreport  overtime and were told to alter their weekly timecards so\n\nthat no overtime hours would be included.\n\n          In its defense, The Monitor  argued that its policy  of\r                                               \n\ndiscouraging overtime hours while  paying those employees who did\n\nin fact  report them does not  compel the conclusion that  it was\n\nwillfully violating the  FLSA.  Rather, they contended  that this\n\npolicy \"illustrates the efforts  of an employer trying to  do the\n\nright thing in  the face of  hopelessly outdated 40-year-old  DOL\n\njournalism  interpretations which provide  absolutely no guidance\n\nregarding  which journalists in a modern  newsroom are exempt and\n\nwhich are not.\"   In  support of this  contention, The  Monitor's\r                                                                         \n\neditor-in-chief testified that he  had never instructed anyone at\n\nThe Monitor to alter  a timecard, and that  The Monitor paid  its\r                                                                 \n\nemployees  for  all  reported   overtime.

The  district court allowed the evidence  pending a\r                     \n\nfinal ruling  on admissibility.   Ultimately, the  court excluded\n\nthe  evidence  and  refused  to  award monetary  relief  for  any\n\nviolations  alleged  to have  occurred  after  January 25,  1980,\n\napproximately  the  last day  of the  period  covered by  the DOL\n\ninvestigation.   With  regard  to this  determination, the  court\n\nstated:\n\n            The reason  for this . .  . limitation is\n            that,    although     plaintiff    claims\n            \"continuing\" violations of FLSA, the case\n            was largely prepared by the defendants on\n            the  ground that violations,  if any, did\n            not  continue  beyond  January 25,  1980.\n            The court, having  taken the matter under\n            advisement, Tr. 1-43, 44, finds and rules\n            that it would  be unjust and  inequitable\n            to  allow damages  to be recovered  for a\n            period beyond January 25, 1980.\n\nNewspapers  of New  England, Inc.,  834 F.

The record contains\n\nample  support for  the district  court's determination  that The\r                                                                           \n\n                               -49-\r\r\n\nMonitor  was unfairly  surprised  by the  Secretary's attempt  to\r                 \n\nprove post-investigation violations at trial.  Exhibit A attached\n\nto the  Secretary's complaint  accurately detailed the  amount of\n\nback  wages sought for each employee.  Exhibit A did not indicate\n\nthat the claimed wages would be revised at trial to reflect post-\n\ninvestigation violations.21   The  Pre-trial  Order's summary  of\n\nthe Secretary's  claims also  did not reflect  post-investigation\n\ndamages.   Rather, the Pre-trial Order stated that damages sought\n\nby  the  Secretary  were  only  those  contained  in  Exhibit  A.\n\nFurthermore,  the DOL  compliance officer in  charge of  the case\n\nstated  at his deposition that Exhibit A contained all the claims\n\nbeing brought by the  Secretary.  Counsel  for the DOL failed  to\n\nobject  to either  the Pre-trial  Order or  the testimony  of its\n\ncompliance  officer.   The district  court apparently  found that\n\nthis  confluence  of  events  led  The  Monitor  to  conduct  its\r                                                         \n\ndiscovery on the  reasonable belief  that the  Secretary did  not\n\nintend    to   pursue    back   wages    for   post-investigation\n\nviolations.22    We  do  not   find  this  to  be  an   abuse  of\n                    \r                              \n\n21  The  fact that Exhibit A did not  indicate that the Secretary\nwould seek  damages  for  post-investigation  violations  is  not\ndispositive because  the Secretary's complaint did  aver that the\nviolations were ongoing.\n\n22   After  discovery  closed, the  Secretary  sought  to  reopen\ndiscovery to update its back wage computations so that they would\nreflect post-investigation  violations.   Though  the  magistrate\njudge hearing  the motion  ultimately denied it,  the Secretary's\nsupporting arguments are enlightening:\n\n            The sole choice, therefore, for . . . the\n            Court  is whether  the  pay practices  at\n            issue are to be dealt with in one lawsuit\n            or  in  a  series  of lawsuits.    It  is\n\n                               -50-\r\r\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          Affirmed.\r                            \n\n                    \r                              \n\n            Plaintiff's  position that  resolution of\n            all   back  wage   claims  in   a  single\n            litigation would involve less expenditure\n            of  time and money . . . .  Plaintiff is,\n            however, fully prepared  to file a second\n            lawsuit  to protect  its right  to assert\n            its claims  as to unpaid  back wages  for\n            the  period  January   26,  1980  to  the\n            present.\n\nObviously, this  motion notified  The Monitor that  the Secretary\r                                                       \nsought post-investigation damages.  It is equally clear, however,\nthat the Secretary believed  at the time that it would  be forced\nto file a second lawsuit  to secure post-investigation damages if\nthe  motion to reopen discovery was denied.  The Secretary cannot\nnow  prevail  in  arguing  that  the  district  court  abused its\ndiscretion  by  finding  that  The   Monitor  was  understandably\r                                                      \nunprepared at trial to  defend allegations of  post-investigation\nviolations.    The Secretary  should have  either filed  a second\nlawsuit  or objected  to  the magistrate  judge's  denial of  the\nmotion pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 72(a).  The  fact that it did\nneither may not be rectified on appeal.\n\n                               -51-\r\r\n</pre>",
