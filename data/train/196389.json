In 1991 when Anthony Parisi,\r                     LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nII  (\"Anthony\")  was  nine  years old,  the  Social  Security\r\n\nAdministration  reduced  the  amount  he  was  receiving   in\r\n\ndependent child's benefits on  account of his disabled father\r\n\nAnthony  Parisi (\"Parisi\") from $464 a month to $262 a month.\r\n\nThe purported justification for  the reduction is a provision\r\n\nin the Social Security Act (\"SSA\") that sets a maximum amount\r\n\nthat can be paid out  on a single wage earner's account.   If\r\n\nthe  benefits paid  on  that account  exceed  the maximum,  a\r\n\nreduction  is required to comply  with the cap.   The cap was\r\n\nexceeded  in this case,  the agency says,  when Parisi's wife\r\n\n(who is not Anthony's  mother and with whom Anthony  does not\r\n\nlive)  was  deemed \"entitled\"  under  one  subsection of  the\r\n\nstatute  to spousal  benefits on  Parisi's account.   Another\r\n\npart of the same section of the statute,  however, prohibited\r\n\nany portion  of those  benefits from  actually being paid  to\r\n\nher.  The question is whether those spousal \"benefits,\" which\r\n\nwere never actually payable, were properly counted toward the\r\n\nfamily  maximum  cap.   We conclude  that  they were  not and\r\n\naccordingly  affirm  the  district court's  reversal  of  the\r\n\nagency's determination.\r\n\n                    I.  Factual Background\r                                                      \r\n\n         While married  to Adriana Parisi,  Anthony Parisi, a\r\n\nfisherman,  had a  child, Anthony  Parisi, II,  with Lorralee\r\n\nCooney of Gloucester, Massachusetts.   Anthony lives with Ms.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nCooney, who has sole custody of him and brings this action on\r\n\nhis behalf.\r\n\n         In February 1988, Parisi became disabled, and he and\r\n\nAnthony, as his dependent,  started receiving payments on his\r\n\naccount as a wage  earner.1  In 1991, Adriana  Parisi applied\r\n\nfor  and became  eligible  for  early retirement  (\"old-age\")\r\n\nbenefits under the SSA based on her own wage-earner's record.\r\n\nBy  operation of  the statute,  she was  automatically deemed\r\n\nalso  to have applied for and to qualify for spousal benefits\r                \r\n\non Parisi's account.   See 42  U.S.C.   402(r)(1).   However,\r                                      \r\n\nbecause the benefits to which Adriana was entitled on her own\r                                                                         \r\n\naccount exceeded the spousal benefits for which she qualified\r\n\non her husband's account, it was determined that she could be\r\n\npaid benefits only on her own account.\r\n\n         The  agency also  decided,  however,  that Adriana's\r\n\nspousal benefits   even though not actually payable to her or\r\n\nanyone  else    still  had to  be  counted toward  the  SSA's\r\n\nstatutory  limit (the \"family maximum\") on benefits available\r\n\non a single  worker's record.   Because the benefits  Anthony\r\n\nwas  already  receiving,  when  combined  with  Parisi's  own\r\n\nbenefits  and  Adriana's   (non-payable)  spousal   benefits,\r\n\nexceeded  the  statutory maximum  amount, the  agency reduced\r\n\nAnthony's  dependent  benefits.    Lorralee  Cooney   was  so\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  It  is  undisputed that  Anthony  was  and still  remains\r\nentitled to  receive dependent child's benefits  on the basis\r\nof Parisi's work record.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nnotified.  On reconsideration at Cooney's request, the agency\r\n\nreaffirmed its decision to reduce Anthony's benefits.\r\n\n         The  agency's  determination   was  appealed  to  an\r\n\nadministrative   law  judge   (\"ALJ\"),  who   concluded  that\r\n\nAdriana's non-payable  spousal benefits should not be counted\r                                                              \r\n\ntoward the  family maximum.   The agency  appealed the  ALJ's\r\n\ndecision  to  the  Social  Security  Appeals  Council,  which\r\n\nreversed  the  ALJ.    The  Appeals  Council's  decision  was\r\n\nappealed to the district court.  See 42  U.S.C   405(g).  The\r                                                \r\n\nagency  argued  that under  the  plain language  of  the SSA,\r\n\ncalculation    of   the    family   maximum    includes   all\r                                                                         \r\n\n\"entitlements,\" not just entitlements  that result in  actual\r\n\npayment.  The  district court disagreed.   It concluded  that\r\n\nthe  SSA's \"family  maximum\"  cap on  benefits  was meant  to\r\n\ninclude  only  \"effective  entitlements\"  (entitlements  that\r\n\nresult    in   some   actual   payment),   not   \"conditional\r\n\nentitlements,\"  and  that  because  Adriana  Parisi's spousal\r\n\nbenefits were  only conditional (upon her  not being entitled\r                                           \r\n\nto a larger benefit  on her own wage-earner's  account), they\r\n\nwere not properly counted toward the family maximum.\r\n\n              II.  Relevant Statutory Provisions\r                                                            \r\n\n         The  two statutory provisions primarily at issue are\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   403(a) and 42 U.S.C.    402(k)(3)(A).  The former\r\n\ncontains the \"family maximum\" provision and the latter is the\r\n\nprovision that prevents  Adriana Parisi  from being  actually\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\npaid  any  spousal benefits  on  the basis  of  Parisi's work\r\n\nrecord (which she would otherwise have received under section\r\n\n402(b)(1)).   Section  403(a) provides  in pertinent  part as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n         . . . [T]he total monthly benefits to  which\r\n         beneficiaries may be entitled under  section\r\n         402 or 423  of this title for a month on the\r\n         basis  of  the  wages  and   self-employment\r\n         income  of  [an]   individual  [wage-earner]\r\n         shall . . . be  reduced as  necessary so  as\r\n         not  to  exceed [the  maximum amount  set by\r\n         statute].\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   403(a)(1).   And section 402(k)(3)(A) provides in\r\n\nrelevant part:\r\n\n         If an individual  is entitled to an  old-age\r\n         or  disability  insurance  benefit  for  any\r\n         month and  to  any other  monthly  insurance\r\n         benefit   for   such   month,   such   other\r\n         insurance benefit for such  month, after any\r\n         reduction  . . .  under  section  403(a)  of\r\n         this title,  shall be reduced, but not below\r\n         zero, by an amount equal to  such old-age or\r\n         disability insurance benefit . . . .\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    402(k)(3)(A).\r\n\n         The parties  agree that, because  the monthly amount\r\n\nof Adriana Parisi's  old-age benefits on her  own work record\r\n\nexceeds the amount of  spousal benefits she could be  paid on\r                   \r\n\nher    husband's    record    under     section    402(b)(1),\r\n\nsection 402(k)(3)(A) has  the result of reducing  to zero the\r                                                                     \r\n\npayable amount of Adriana  Parisi's spousal benefits.  It  is\r\n\nalso agreed that Adriana's  own old-age benefits, as  well as\r\n\nParisi's benefits, are not subject to reduction under section\r                                      \r\n\n403(a).    Thus  the  only  payable  benefits  at  stake  are\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nAnthony's.2  The  statutory issue  is whether  the amount  of\r\n\n\"total  monthly  benefits  to  which  beneficiaries   may  be\r\n\nentitled\" for  purposes of  section 403(a) must  include what\r\n\nthe monthly  amount of Adriana's spousal  benefits would have\r\n\nbeen under section 402(b)(1) but for the operation of section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A)  of  the  statute.    If  Adriana's  non-payable\r\n\nspousal  benefits   are  included   in  the   family  maximum\r\n\ncalculation,  then Anthony's benefits  were properly reduced.\r\n\nIf not, then the district court's judgment must be affirmed.\r\n\n                       III.  Discussion\r                                                   \r\n\n         Our analysis  begins with  the text  of the statute.\r\n\nIf the meaning  of the text is clear,  then that meaning must\r\n\nbe  given effect, unless it would produce an absurd result or\r\n\none manifestly  at odds  with the statute's  intended effect.\r\n\nSt.  Luke's Hosp. v. Secretary of HHS, 810 F.2d 325, 331 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1987).   If the  relevant text and  congressional intent\r\n\nare ambiguous, then an  agency's reasonable interpretation is\r\n\nentitled to deference.   See Chevron U.S.A.,  Inc. v. Natural\r                                                                         \r\n\nResources Defense  Council, Inc., 467  U.S. 837  (1984).   No\r                                            \r\n\ndeference, though,  is due  an agency interpretation  that is\r\n\ninconsistent with  the language  of the statute,  contrary to\r\n\nthe  statute's  intended   effect,  arbitrary,  or  otherwise\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The parties also agree that if  Adriana had actually been\r\npaid   spousal  benefits   on   Parisi's   account,  then   a\r\ncorresponding reduction  in benefits for  Anthony would  have\r\nbeen warranted under the family maximum provision.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nunreasonable.   See Massachusetts  Dep't of Energy  v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates Dep't of Education, 837 F.2d 536, 541 (1st Cir. 1988).\r                                     \r\n\nA.  The Statutory Language\r                                      \r\n\n         The  agency  claims  that  its  position  is plainly\r\n\nsupported  by  two aspects  of the  statutory text:  the term\r\n\n\"entitled\"  in  section 403(a),  and  the  phrase \"after  any\r\n\nreduction   . . .   under    section   403(a)\"   in   section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A).   We conclude that the statutory  text does not\r\n\nsupport the intuitively troubling result urged by the agency.\r\n\n         The Commissioner of Social Security (\"Commissioner\")\r\n\nemphasizes that the family maximum is formulated on the basis\r\n\nof entitlement, and that section 403(a) never speaks in terms\r                          \r\n\nof  benefits actually  received.   Thus,  the argument  goes,\r\n\nbecause subsection  (b)(1)  of  section  402,  considered  in\r\n\nisolation, \"entitles\" Adriana Parisi  to spousal benefits  on\r\n\nthe  basis of her husband's SSA record, such benefits must be\r\n\nincluded in  the family maximum calculation,  even though the\r\n\nsame  section of the statute just a few paragraphs later, see\r                                                                         \r\n\n  402(k)(3)(A), operates to render those very benefits wholly\r\n\nnon-payable.\r                       \r\n\n         The  Commissioner's   argument  is   strained,   and\r\n\ncertainly  not  dictated  by   the  statutory  text's   plain\r\n\nlanguage.

The agency's  claim that  section 403(a)\r\n\nrequires the  inclusion of  all \"entitlements\" in  the family\r\n\nmaximum  computation begs  the question  whether  a so-called\r\n\n\"entitlement\"  created in  one  part of  section 402  that is\r\n\nsimultaneously prevented from  yielding any actually  payable\r\n\nbenefit  by another  applicable  portion of  section 402  can\r\n\nproperly be  deemed an  \"entitle[ment] under section  402\" at\r\n\nall.3   We doubt that it can.   Indeed, even according to the\r\n\nagency's own regulatory definition, a person is \"entitled\" to\r\n\na benefit only when that person \"has proven his  or her right\r\n\nto  benefits for  a period  of time.\"   20  C.F.R.   404.303.\r\n\nHere, Adriana Parisi has \"proven\"  no right to benefits under\r                                                                         \r\n\nsection 402 (taken as a whole) for any period of time.\r                                                  \r\n\n         We   need   not   decide,   however,   whether   the\r\n\nCommissioner's understanding  of  the term  \"entitlement\"  is\r\n\nsomehow  supportable,  because  the agency's  argument,  even\r\n\ntaken  on its  own terms, does  not carry  the day.

It would seem an unconventional usage at best to say that\r\nAdriana  Parisi is  entitled  to benefits  which the  statute\r                                        \r\nclearly disallows in her  case, leaving her with not  even an\r\nexpectancy  of receiving them.

Section  403(a) places  a\r\n\nlimit  not on entitlements per  se, but rather  on \"the total\r                                              \r\n\nmonthly benefits to which beneficiaries may be entitled under\r                                                                         \r\n\nsection 402 . . . .\"  42 U.S.C.   403(a) (emphases added).  A\r                       \r\n\nnatural reading  of this  language suggests that  the primary\r\n\nobject of limitation is the \"total monthly benefits\" produced\r\n\nby the operation  of section 402 as a whole,  and not, as the\r                                                       \r\n\nCommissioner  argues, theoretical entitlements created by one\r\n\nfragment  of section  402 considered in  artificial isolation\r\n\nfrom the rest of that same section, and wholly apart from the\r\n\nbenefits that ultimately attach.  Here, the total benefits to\r                                                                      \r\n\nwhich Adriana Parisi might be deemed \"entitled\" under section\r\n\n402     when that  section is  considered  in its  entirety  \r\n\namount  to zero.   Hence,  Adriana's putative  benefits under\r                           \r\n\nsection  402 could  not possibly  contribute anything  to the\r\n\nfamily maximum computation under section 403(a).\r\n\n         In addition to requiring an unnatural reading of the\r\n\nstatute,  the Commissioner's  argument is  logically unsound.\r\n\nUnder the Commissioner's \"pure entitlement\" approach, section\r\n\n403(a)  is  said to  place  a ceiling  on  pure entitlements,\r\n\nregardless whether  any payable benefits attach  thereto.  If\r\n\nthe  total  amount  of  entitlements available  on  a  single\r                                                \r\n\nworker's record  exceeds the  statutory limit, so  the theory\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ngoes, a  reduction under section 403(a)  is required, whether\r\n\nthe  excess entitlements produce payable benefits or not.  On\r\n\nthe other  hand, the Commissioner  simultaneously claims that\r\n\nwhen  the total  amount of  \"entitlements\" causes  the family\r\n\nmaximum cap to be  exceeded, it is the payable  benefits that\r                                                                    \r\n\nare subject to reduction under the statute.  This position is\r\n\ninternally inconsistent.   If the thrust of section 403(a) is\r\n\nto  place a limit on entitlements, it is contradictory to say\r                                             \r\n\nthat compliance with the  family maximum cap can be  achieved\r\n\nthrough a reduction of  payable benefits.  Because  under the\r                                                    \r\n\nCommissioner's  logic, an \"entitlement\"  is entirely separate\r\n\nfrom the payable benefits (if any) that attach, it would seem\r\n\nto  follow that a reduction  in benefits paid  could never be\r                                                         \r\n\neffective to achieve compliance with the cap.\r\n\n         We conclude that  the Commissioner's contention that\r\n\nsection   403(a)   is  concerned   purely   with  theoretical\r\n\nentitlements,  irrespective of  whether any  actually payable\r\n\nbenefits attach thereto, is supported neither by the language\r\n\nof the statute nor by reason.\r\n\n         We  also  are  unpersuaded  by   the  Commissioner's\r\n\nargument  to the  extent it  rests on  the phrase  \"after any\r\n\nreduction    . . .   under   section   403(a)\"   in   section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A).   The  Commissioner contends  that this  phrase\r\n\nspecifically    instructs    that    the   reduction    under\r\n\nsection 403(a)  for  compliance   with  the  family   maximum\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nprovision  be computed  before any  reduction is  taken under\r                                          \r\n\nsection 402(k)(3)(A),  and that,  therefore, for  purposes of\r\n\nsection  403(a), Adriana  Parisi's  spousal benefits  must be\r\n\ntreated (contrary to fact) as if they were fully payable.\r\n\n         The Commissioner  reads  too  much into  the  phrase\r\n\n\"after any  reduction . . .  under section 403(a).\"   Section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A) is triggered when  an individual who is entitled\r\n\nto  old-age benefits on  her own  social security  record (as\r\n\nAdriana  is in this case)  is also facially  entitled to some\r                                              \r\n\nother simultaneous benefit (in this case, spousal benefits on\r\n\nParisi's  account).   In substance, section  402(k)(3)(A) has\r\n\nthe  effect  of authorizing  such  an  individual to  receive\r\n\npayment of  the larger of the two  simultaneous benefits, but\r\n\nnot  both.4   Thus, section  402(k)(3)(A) requires  comparing\r\n\nthe size  of the beneficiary's  \"other\" benefit with  her own\r\n\nold-age  benefit.   The  \"after any  reduction under  section\r\n\n403(a)\"  language in  section  402(k)(3)(A) ensures  that, in\r\n\ndetermining the amount of the \"other\" simultaneous benefit in\r\n\nquestion,  the  calculation  will   take  into  account   any\r\n\nreduction  to the  \"other\"  benefit that  would otherwise  be\r\n\nrequired  under section  403(a).   This prevents  the old-age\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  More precisely, the provision entitles the beneficiary to\r\npayment of  her old-age  benefit plus the  difference between\r                                                 \r\nthe  \"other\"  benefit  and   the  old-age  benefit,  if  that\r\ndifference is greater than zero.  This is the same  as saying\r\nthat  the beneficiary is entitled  to an amount  equal to the\r\nlarger of the two simultaneous benefits in question.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nbeneficiary from receiving, by operation  of the simultaneous\r\n\nbenefits  provision,  any  amount  of  benefits   that  would\r\n\notherwise be excluded as exceeding the cap imposed by section\r\n\n403(a).5\r\n\n         There  is  nothing   in  the  language  of   section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A) or  section 403(a), however, that  dictates that\r\n\nthe family  maximum computation cannot take  into account the\r\n\nfact that  an entitlement  that would normally  contribute to\r\n\nthe  family maximum  amount  has  been  reduced  to  zero  by\r\n\noperation of  the simultaneous benefits  provision of section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A).  It is true that the computation required under\r\n\nsection  402(k)(3)(A)  requires  a provisional  determination\r\n\nwhether  the  \"other\" simultaneous  benefit  (here, Adriana's\r\n\nspousal benefits) would, if  payable, be subject to reduction\r\n\nunder section 403(a).  But this computation is only necessary\r\n\nfor the  purpose  of  determining what  portion  of  the  two\r\n\nsimultaneous  benefits the beneficiary  (Adriana) is entitled\r\n\nto receive.   There is  no language in  section 402(k)(3)(A),\r\n\nand  certainly  not in  section  403(a),  requiring that  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Suppose,   for   example,    that   a   beneficiary    is\r\nsimultaneously entitled to receive her own old-age benefit of\r\namount  B and a  spousal benefit of  amount S.   Suppose also\r\nthat if the spousal benefit were payable, the family  maximum\r\ncap would be exceeded,  and the spousal benefit (S)  would be\r\nreduced by the  amount of the statutory  reduction, to amount\r\nS(r).    The  \"after   any  reduction\"  language  in  section\r\n402(k)(3)(A)  ensures that  the beneficiary  will receive  an\r\namount equal  to the larger  of B and  the reduced S(r),  not\r                                                                         \r\nsimply the larger of B and S.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nfamily maximum  computation ignore the actual  results of the\r                                              \r\n\nsimultaneous benefits determination of section 402(k)(3)(A).\r\n\n         To the contrary, the statutory language  suggests an\r\n\ninterplay  between  section 403(a)  and  section 402(k)(3)(A)\r\n\nthat  belies  the  position  advanced  by  the  Commissioner.\r\n\nSection 403(a)  requires only such \"reduc[tion]  as necessary\r                                                                         \r\n\nso as not to  exceed\" the family maximum.   The determination\r\n\nof whether a reduction is necessary in this case depends upon\r\n\nthe  calculation of  the  \"total monthly  benefits\" to  which\r\n\nAdriana Parisi \"may  be entitled  under section  402\" on  the\r\n\nbasis of her husband's SSA record.  As explained, that amount\r\n\nis  zero.    Hence,  the relevant  \"total  monthly  benefits\"\r                    \r\n\navailable under section 402 on Parisi's work record (combined\r\n\nwith  Parisi's  own benefits)  do  not  exceed the  statutory\r\n\nceiling.  It cannot be \"necessary,\" then, to reduce Anthony's\r\n\nbenefits.\r\n\n         We  conclude that  the Commissioner's  position does\r\n\nnot follow  from the  plain language of  section 402(k)(3)(A)\r\n\nand section 403(a).\r\n\nB.  Legislative History\r                                   \r\n\n         As the district court  observed, the  interpretation\r\n\nurged  by the  Commissioner produces  a result  that Congress\r\n\napparently   sought  to   avoid.     The  most   illuminating\r\n\nlegislative  comments  are  found   in  connection  with  the\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nenactment of the  1949 amendments to  the SSA, which  changed\r\n\nthe previously existing family maximum provision:\r\n\n         Under the  present  law,  the total  of  the\r\n         family benefits  for a  month is reduced  to\r\n         the  maximum  permitted by  section [403(a)]\r\n         prior  to any  deductions on  account of the\r\n         occurrence of  any  event specified  in  the\r\n         law . . . .  Section [403(a)] as amended  by\r\n         the   bill   reverses  this   procedure  and\r\n         provides that  the  reduction in  the  total\r\n         benefits for  a month  is to  be made  after\r\n         the deductions.   As a result, larger family\r\n         benefits will be payable in many cases.\r\n\nS. Rep. No. 1669,  81st Cong., 2d Sess.

We add,\r                                           \r\n\nhowever, as  a  capstone to  our  analysis, that  the  Social\r\n\nSecurity Administration's  own regulations are  at odds  with\r\n\nits  proposed construction  of the  statute.   The regulation\r\n\nthat  describes generally  the effect  of the  family maximum\r\n\nprovision explains its operation in this way:\r\n\n         Family Maximum.   As explained in   404.403,\r                                   \r\n         there  is  a  maximum  amount  set  for each\r\n         insured   person's  earnings   record   that\r\n         limits the  total benefits  payable on  that\r                                                        \r\n         record.  If you are entitled  to benefits as\r\n         the  insured's  dependent or  survivor, your\r\n         benefits  may   be  reduced  to  keep  total\r                                                                 \r\n         benefits  payable  to  the insured's  family\r                                      \r\n         within these limits.\r\n\n20 C.F.R.   404.304(d) (emphasis added).  The regulation that\r\n\nmore  specifically  describes  the operation  of  the  family\r\n\nmaximum provision contains similar language:\r\n\n         The Social  Security Act  limits the  amount\r\n         of  monthly benefits  that can  be  paid for\r                                                             \r\n         any  month  based  on  the  earnings  of  an\r\n         insured individual.\r\n\n20 C.F.R.   404.403(a)(1) (emphasis added).\r\n\n         The agency's  own  interpretative  regulations  thus\r\n\ninterpret the family maximum  provision as operating to limit\r\n\nthe  \"amount  of  benefits that  can  be  paid\"  on a  single\r                                                          \r\n\nworker's account.  They do not state that section 403(a) caps\r\n\nthe total amount of  entitlements that might be available  on\r                                             \r\n\nan   account.    That  the  agency  has  chosen  in  its  own\r\n\nregulations  to  describe the  family  maximum  as placing  a\r\n\nceiling on  benefits paid or  payable casts further  doubt on\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nits  contention here  that section  403(a) is  concerned with\r\n\ncapping  pure  entitlements,  regardless  of  the  amount  of\r                                                    \r\n\npayable benefits that attach.\r\n\n         To  similar  effect is  language  contained  in  the\r\n\nagency's   written   rulings   on   Anthony's   benefits   as\r\n\ncommunicated to  Lorralee Cooney.   In the first  letter from\r\n\nthe Social  Security Administration  to Cooney  notifying her\r\n\nthat  her  son's  benefits  were to  be  reduced,  the agency\r\n\nexplained that the reduction was required because the statute\r\n\nimposes  a \"limit  on how  much we can  pay on  each person's\r                                                       \r\n\nSocial  Security record [emphasis  added].\"  And  later, in a\r\n\nletter    reaffirming    its    initial     decision    after\r\n\nreconsideration, the  agency informed Cooney that  the family\r\n\nmaximum provision  \"limits the  total amount of  the benefits\r\n\npayable on an individual's earnings record.\"\r                   \r\n\n         The regulations  and agency statements quoted  above\r\n\nsupport  the  conclusion  we  adopt here,  namely,  that  the\r\n\n\"family  maximum\"  provision of  section  403(a) operates  to\r\n\nlimit  only  those  benefits that  are  payable  on a  single\r                                                           \r\n\nworker's account.\r\n\nD.  Policy Considerations\r                                     \r\n\n         We  observe,  finally,  that  the  purported  policy\r\n\nreasons offered in support of the Commissioner's construction\r\n\nof the statute lack persuasive force.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n         The agency says its  position prevents families from\r\n\nreceiving duplicative  or excessive benefits.   In this case,\r\n\nthe  Commissioner  asserts,  applying section 403(a)  in  the\r\n\nmanner suggested would  have the effect  of making the  total\r\n\namount  of benefits  payable  to the  \"family unit\"  (Parisi,\r\n\nAnthony,  and Adriana)  roughly  the same  as  it was  before\r\n\nAdriana became entitled to receive her own old-age benefits.\r\n\n         The problem with  this rationale is twofold.  First,\r\n\nthe family maximum provision (despite its common appellation)\r\n\nis written not as  a broad limitation upon the  amount that a\r                          \r\n\nfamily  unit can receive in total SSA benefits, but rather as\r\n\na specific  limitation upon the amount  of benefits available\r\n\non the  basis of  a single  worker's record.   See 20  C.F.R.\r                                                              \r\n\n  404.403(a)(1)  (explaining  that  section  403(a)  places a\r\n\nmaximum \"for  each person's  earnings record that  limits the\r\n\ntotal benefits  payable  on that  record\" (emphasis  added)).\r                                                    \r\n\nAdriana \"earned\" her old age  benefits through her own  years\r\n\nin the work force,  not because she  was the wife of  Parisi.\r\n\nThe question under section 403(a) is not whether the family's\r                                                                       \r\n\nbenefits  have  exceeded a  certain  level,  but whether  the\r\n\nbenefits  payable  on  a single  wage-earner's  account  have\r\n\nexceeded the statutory maximum.\r\n\n         Second, the agency's suggestion  that the  reduction\r\n\nof benefits  to Anthony prevents duplicative  payments to the\r\n\n\"family  unit\" rings hollow.   Anthony lives with his natural\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nmother, not with  Adriana and  Parisi.  The  agency does  not\r\n\nsuggest that  any portion  of Adriana's or  Parisi's benefits\r\n\nreaches the child.   The agency's statement  that \"the family\r\n\nunit  continues  to receive  approximately  the same  overall\r\n\nbenefits as  it did before\"  thus distorts reality.  In fact,\r\n\nunder the agency's interpretation, Anthony receives only half\r\n\nthe benefits he was receiving before; and because neither the\r\n\nfather's  nor Adriana  Parisi's own  benefits are  subject to\r\n\nreduction under  the family maximum provision, it is only the\r                                                                     \r\n\nchild who has been adversely affected  by the agency's action\r\n\nin this case.\r\n\n         The other purported  policy justification offered in\r\n\ndefense of  the Commissioner's position is  that reduction of\r\n\nthe child's benefits in  this case is required to  uphold the\r\n\nmeaning  of  \"entitlement.\"   The Commissioner  contends that\r\n\nbecause section 403(a) places  a limit on \"entitlements,\" and\r\n\nbecause  Adriana Parisi  is  \"entitled\" to  spousal  benefits\r\n\nunder  one  subsection  of  the statute  (even  though  those\r\n\nbenefits  are not  payable),  failure to  include those  non-\r\n\npayable  benefits in the family maximum tally will dilute the\r\n\nmeaning of \"entitlement\" under the SSA.\r\n\n         We find  this reasoning  unpersuasive.   The flaw in\r\n\nthis  argument is the same  as the flaw  underlying its plain\r\n\nmeaning argument:  it incorrectly assumes that section 403(a)\r\n\nis concerned  with  keeping  pure  \"entitlements\"  under  the\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nstatutory limit.   To the  contrary, as  we concluded  above,\r\n\nsection 403(a)  operates  in this  case  to limit  the  total\r\n\namount of  benefits payable on a  single wage-earner's record\r                                       \r\n\nunder the relevant benefits provisions (read as a whole), not\r\n\nto  limit  entitlements  theoretically  available  under  one\r\n\nsubsection of the statute considered in artificial isolation.\r\n\nIn   any  event,   although  this   conclusion  negates   the\r\n\nCommissioner's  claim  that   Adriana  Parisi's   non-payable\r\n\nspousal  benefits  must be  included  in  the family  maximum\r\n\ncalculation,   it   does    not   directly   undermine    the\r\n\nCommissioner's purported definition of \"entitlement,\"  nor is\r\n\nit  necessarily inconsistent  with saying  here  that Adriana\r\n\nParisi  has,  in some  abstract  sense,  an \"entitlement\"  to\r\n\nspousal benefits  under section  402(b)(1) read  in isolation\r\n\nfrom the rest  of section 402.   We hold only  that Adriana's\r\n\nnon-payable spousal benefits do  not count toward the section\r\n\n403(a) \"family maximum.\"\r\n\nE.  Conclusion\r                          \r\n\n         We  conclude   that  the   Commissioner's   proposed\r\n\nconstruction  of  section  403(a)  is not  supported  by  the\r\n\nlanguage of the statute, is logically flawed, is inconsistent\r\n\nwith  the  statute's  intended  effect, is  contrary  to  the\r\n\nagency's own interpretative regulations, and is not supported\r\n\nby  any sound considerations  of policy.   Accordingly, we do\r\n\nnot defer to the Commissioner's position under the principles\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nof Chevron, and we hold that section 403(a) operates to limit\r                      \r\n\nthe total  amount of  benefits actually payable  on a  single\r                                                           \r\n\nworker's record, not the amount of entitlements theoretically\r\n\navailable.6\r\n\n         In this case, because Adriana Parisi's \"entitlement\"\r\n\nunder section 402(b)(1) to  spousal benefits on Parisi's work\r\n\nrecord  produces zero  payable benefits  as a  result  of the\r                                          \r\n\noperation  of  section  402(k)(3)(A),  no such  benefits  are\r\n\nincluded  in the  computation required  under section 403(a).\r\n\nConsequently,  the total  amount of  benefits payable  on the\r\n\nbasis of  Parisi's work  record does not  exceed the  maximum\r\n\nimposed  by  the  statute,  and it  is  not  \"necessary\"  for\r\n\npurposes of section 403(a) to reduce Anthony's benefits.  The\r\n\ndistrict court correctly reversed  the decision of the Social\r\n\nSecurity Appeals Council.\r\n\n         Affirmed.\r                             \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Our reasoning differs from  that employed by the district\r\ncourt.   The district  court's analysis distinguished between\r\n\"effective\"   and   \"conditional\"    entitlements.       This\r\ndistinction, although sensible, has no roots in the statutory\r\nlanguage.   We  rely, instead,  on  the notion  that  section\r\n403(a) places  a limit  not  upon non-payable  \"entitlements\"\r\ncreated  by  an  isolated subsection  of  the  SSA,  but upon\r\npayable benefits    in this case, the  total benefits yielded\r\nby  section 402 of the SSA  read as a whole.   This notion is\r\nsemantically supported by the  statutory framework and by the\r\nagency's own  regulations, which speak  specifically in terms\r\nof payable benefits (e.g., 20 C.F.R.   404.304(d)).\r                                     \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n",

In 1991 when Anthony Parisi,\r                     LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nII  (\"Anthony\")  was  nine  years old,  the  Social  Security\r\n\nAdministration  reduced  the  amount  he  was  receiving   in\r\n\ndependent child's benefits on  account of his disabled father\r\n\nAnthony  Parisi (\"Parisi\") from $464 a month to $262 a month.\r\n\nThe purported justification for  the reduction is a provision\r\n\nin the Social Security Act (\"SSA\") that sets a maximum amount\r\n\nthat can be paid out  on a single wage earner's account.   If\r\n\nthe  benefits paid  on  that account  exceed  the maximum,  a\r\n\nreduction  is required to comply  with the cap.   The cap was\r\n\nexceeded  in this case,  the agency says,  when Parisi's wife\r\n\n(who is not Anthony's  mother and with whom Anthony  does not\r\n\nlive)  was  deemed \"entitled\"  under  one  subsection of  the\r\n\nstatute  to spousal  benefits on  Parisi's account.   Another\r\n\npart of the same section of the statute,  however, prohibited\r\n\nany portion  of those  benefits from  actually being paid  to\r\n\nher.  The question is whether those spousal \"benefits,\" which\r\n\nwere never actually payable, were properly counted toward the\r\n\nfamily  maximum  cap.   We conclude  that  they were  not and\r\n\naccordingly  affirm  the  district court's  reversal  of  the\r\n\nagency's determination.\r\n\n                    I.  Factual Background\r                                                      \r\n\n         While married  to Adriana Parisi,  Anthony Parisi, a\r\n\nfisherman,  had a  child, Anthony  Parisi, II,  with Lorralee\r\n\nCooney of Gloucester, Massachusetts.   Anthony lives with Ms.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nCooney, who has sole custody of him and brings this action on\r\n\nhis behalf.\r\n\n         In February 1988, Parisi became disabled, and he and\r\n\nAnthony, as his dependent,  started receiving payments on his\r\n\naccount as a wage  earner.1  In 1991, Adriana  Parisi applied\r\n\nfor  and became  eligible  for  early retirement  (\"old-age\")\r\n\nbenefits under the SSA based on her own wage-earner's record.\r\n\nBy  operation of  the statute,  she was  automatically deemed\r\n\nalso  to have applied for and to qualify for spousal benefits\r                \r\n\non Parisi's account.   See 42  U.S.C.   402(r)(1).   However,\r                                      \r\n\nbecause the benefits to which Adriana was entitled on her own\r                                                                         \r\n\naccount exceeded the spousal benefits for which she qualified\r\n\non her husband's account, it was determined that she could be\r\n\npaid benefits only on her own account.\r\n\n         The  agency also  decided,  however,  that Adriana's\r\n\nspousal benefits   even though not actually payable to her or\r\n\nanyone  else    still  had to  be  counted toward  the  SSA's\r\n\nstatutory  limit (the \"family maximum\") on benefits available\r\n\non a single  worker's record.   Because the benefits  Anthony\r\n\nwas  already  receiving,  when  combined  with  Parisi's  own\r\n\nbenefits  and  Adriana's   (non-payable)  spousal   benefits,\r\n\nexceeded  the  statutory maximum  amount, the  agency reduced\r\n\nAnthony's  dependent  benefits.    Lorralee  Cooney   was  so\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  It  is  undisputed that  Anthony  was  and still  remains\r\nentitled to  receive dependent child's benefits  on the basis\r\nof Parisi's work record.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nnotified.  On reconsideration at Cooney's request, the agency\r\n\nreaffirmed its decision to reduce Anthony's benefits.\r\n\n         The  agency's  determination   was  appealed  to  an\r\n\nadministrative   law  judge   (\"ALJ\"),  who   concluded  that\r\n\nAdriana's non-payable  spousal benefits should not be counted\r                                                              \r\n\ntoward the  family maximum.   The agency  appealed the  ALJ's\r\n\ndecision  to  the  Social  Security  Appeals  Council,  which\r\n\nreversed  the  ALJ.    The  Appeals  Council's  decision  was\r\n\nappealed to the district court.  See 42  U.S.C   405(g).  The\r                                                \r\n\nagency  argued  that under  the  plain language  of  the SSA,\r\n\ncalculation    of   the    family   maximum    includes   all\r                                                                         \r\n\n\"entitlements,\" not just entitlements  that result in  actual\r\n\npayment.  The  district court disagreed.   It concluded  that\r\n\nthe  SSA's \"family  maximum\"  cap on  benefits  was meant  to\r\n\ninclude  only  \"effective  entitlements\"  (entitlements  that\r\n\nresult    in   some   actual   payment),   not   \"conditional\r\n\nentitlements,\"  and  that  because  Adriana  Parisi's spousal\r\n\nbenefits were  only conditional (upon her  not being entitled\r                                           \r\n\nto a larger benefit  on her own wage-earner's  account), they\r\n\nwere not properly counted toward the family maximum.\r\n\n              II.  Relevant Statutory Provisions\r                                                            \r\n\n         The  two statutory provisions primarily at issue are\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   403(a) and 42 U.S.C.    402(k)(3)(A).  The former\r\n\ncontains the \"family maximum\" provision and the latter is the\r\n\nprovision that prevents  Adriana Parisi  from being  actually\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\npaid  any  spousal benefits  on  the basis  of  Parisi's work\r\n\nrecord (which she would otherwise have received under section\r\n\n402(b)(1)).   Section  403(a) provides  in pertinent  part as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n         . . . [T]he total monthly benefits to  which\r\n         beneficiaries may be entitled under  section\r\n         402 or 423  of this title for a month on the\r\n         basis  of  the  wages  and   self-employment\r\n         income  of  [an]   individual  [wage-earner]\r\n         shall . . . be  reduced as  necessary so  as\r\n         not  to  exceed [the  maximum amount  set by\r\n         statute].\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   403(a)(1).   And section 402(k)(3)(A) provides in\r\n\nrelevant part:\r\n\n         If an individual  is entitled to an  old-age\r\n         or  disability  insurance  benefit  for  any\r\n         month and  to  any other  monthly  insurance\r\n         benefit   for   such   month,   such   other\r\n         insurance benefit for such  month, after any\r\n         reduction  . . .  under  section  403(a)  of\r\n         this title,  shall be reduced, but not below\r\n         zero, by an amount equal to  such old-age or\r\n         disability insurance benefit . . . .\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    402(k)(3)(A).\r\n\n         The parties  agree that, because  the monthly amount\r\n\nof Adriana Parisi's  old-age benefits on her  own work record\r\n\nexceeds the amount of  spousal benefits she could be  paid on\r                   \r\n\nher    husband's    record    under     section    402(b)(1),\r\n\nsection 402(k)(3)(A) has  the result of reducing  to zero the\r                                                                     \r\n\npayable amount of Adriana  Parisi's spousal benefits.  It  is\r\n\nalso agreed that Adriana's  own old-age benefits, as  well as\r\n\nParisi's benefits, are not subject to reduction under section\r                                      \r\n\n403(a).    Thus  the  only  payable  benefits  at  stake  are\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nAnthony's.2  The  statutory issue  is whether  the amount  of\r\n\n\"total  monthly  benefits  to  which  beneficiaries   may  be\r\n\nentitled\" for  purposes of  section 403(a) must  include what\r\n\nthe monthly  amount of Adriana's spousal  benefits would have\r\n\nbeen under section 402(b)(1) but for the operation of section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A)  of  the  statute.    If  Adriana's  non-payable\r\n\nspousal  benefits   are  included   in  the   family  maximum\r\n\ncalculation,  then Anthony's benefits  were properly reduced.\r\n\nIf not, then the district court's judgment must be affirmed.\r\n\n                       III.

The Statutory Language\r                                      \r\n\n         The  agency  claims  that  its  position  is plainly\r\n\nsupported  by  two aspects  of the  statutory text:  the term\r\n\n\"entitled\"  in  section 403(a),  and  the  phrase \"after  any\r\n\nreduction   . . .   under    section   403(a)\"   in   section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A).   We conclude that the statutory  text does not\r\n\nsupport the intuitively troubling result urged by the agency.\r\n\n         The Commissioner of Social Security (\"Commissioner\")\r\n\nemphasizes that the family maximum is formulated on the basis\r\n\nof entitlement, and that section 403(a) never speaks in terms\r                          \r\n\nof  benefits actually  received.   Thus,  the argument  goes,\r\n\nbecause subsection  (b)(1)  of  section  402,  considered  in\r\n\nisolation, \"entitles\" Adriana Parisi  to spousal benefits  on\r\n\nthe  basis of her husband's SSA record, such benefits must be\r\n\nincluded in  the family maximum calculation,  even though the\r\n\nsame  section of the statute just a few paragraphs later, see\r                                                                         \r\n\n  402(k)(3)(A), operates to render those very benefits wholly\r\n\nnon-payable.\r                       \r\n\n         The  Commissioner's   argument  is   strained,   and\r\n\ncertainly  not  dictated  by   the  statutory  text's   plain\r\n\nlanguage.  Section 403(a)(1)  of the SSA limits  and requires\r\n\nthe reduction  \"as necessary\" of the  \"total monthly benefits\r\n\nto  which beneficiaries  may  be entitled  under section  402\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n. . . on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of\r\n\n[the  wage-earner, here  Mr.  Parisi].\"   42 U.S.C.    403(a)\r\n\n(emphasis  added).   The agency's  claim that  section 403(a)\r\n\nrequires the  inclusion of  all \"entitlements\" in  the family\r\n\nmaximum  computation begs  the question  whether  a so-called\r\n\n\"entitlement\"  created in  one  part of  section 402  that is\r\n\nsimultaneously prevented from  yielding any actually  payable\r\n\nbenefit  by another  applicable  portion of  section 402  can\r\n\nproperly be  deemed an  \"entitle[ment] under section  402\" at\r\n\nall.3   We doubt that it can.   Indeed, even according to the\r\n\nagency's own regulatory definition, a person is \"entitled\" to\r\n\na benefit only when that person \"has proven his  or her right\r\n\nto  benefits for  a period  of time.\"   20  C.F.R.   404.303.\r\n\nHere, Adriana Parisi has \"proven\"  no right to benefits under\r                                                                         \r\n\nsection 402 (taken as a whole) for any period of time.\r                                                  \r\n\n         We   need   not   decide,   however,   whether   the\r\n\nCommissioner's understanding  of  the term  \"entitlement\"  is\r\n\nsomehow  supportable,  because  the agency's  argument,  even\r\n\ntaken  on its  own terms, does  not carry  the day.   For one\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  It would seem an unconventional usage at best to say that\r\nAdriana  Parisi is  entitled  to benefits  which the  statute\r                                        \r\nclearly disallows in her  case, leaving her with not  even an\r\nexpectancy  of receiving them.

Section  403(a) places  a\r\n\nlimit  not on entitlements per  se, but rather  on \"the total\r                                              \r\n\nmonthly benefits to which beneficiaries may be entitled under\r                                                                         \r\n\nsection 402 . . . .\"  42 U.S.C.   403(a) (emphases added).  A\r                       \r\n\nnatural reading  of this  language suggests that  the primary\r\n\nobject of limitation is the \"total monthly benefits\" produced\r\n\nby the operation  of section 402 as a whole,  and not, as the\r                                                       \r\n\nCommissioner  argues, theoretical entitlements created by one\r\n\nfragment  of section  402 considered in  artificial isolation\r\n\nfrom the rest of that same section, and wholly apart from the\r\n\nbenefits that ultimately attach.  Here, the total benefits to\r                                                                      \r\n\nwhich Adriana Parisi might be deemed \"entitled\" under section\r\n\n402     when that  section is  considered  in its  entirety  \r\n\namount  to zero.   Hence,  Adriana's putative  benefits under\r                           \r\n\nsection  402 could  not possibly  contribute anything  to the\r\n\nfamily maximum computation under section 403(a).\r\n\n         In addition to requiring an unnatural reading of the\r\n\nstatute,  the Commissioner's  argument is  logically unsound.\r\n\nUnder the Commissioner's \"pure entitlement\" approach, section\r\n\n403(a)  is  said to  place  a ceiling  on  pure entitlements,\r\n\nregardless whether  any payable benefits attach  thereto.  If\r\n\nthe  total  amount  of  entitlements available  on  a  single\r                                                \r\n\nworker's record  exceeds the  statutory limit, so  the theory\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ngoes, a  reduction under section 403(a)  is required, whether\r\n\nthe  excess entitlements produce payable benefits or not.  On\r\n\nthe other  hand, the Commissioner  simultaneously claims that\r\n\nwhen  the total  amount of  \"entitlements\" causes  the family\r\n\nmaximum cap to be  exceeded, it is the payable  benefits that\r                                                                    \r\n\nare subject to reduction under the statute.  This position is\r\n\ninternally inconsistent.   If the thrust of section 403(a) is\r\n\nto  place a limit on entitlements, it is contradictory to say\r                                             \r\n\nthat compliance with the  family maximum cap can be  achieved\r\n\nthrough a reduction of  payable benefits.  Because  under the\r                                                    \r\n\nCommissioner's  logic, an \"entitlement\"  is entirely separate\r\n\nfrom the payable benefits (if any) that attach, it would seem\r\n\nto  follow that a reduction  in benefits paid  could never be\r                                                         \r\n\neffective to achieve compliance with the cap.\r\n\n         We conclude that  the Commissioner's contention that\r\n\nsection   403(a)   is  concerned   purely   with  theoretical\r\n\nentitlements,  irrespective of  whether any  actually payable\r\n\nbenefits attach thereto, is supported neither by the language\r\n\nof the statute nor by reason.\r\n\n         We  also  are  unpersuaded  by   the  Commissioner's\r\n\nargument  to the  extent it  rests on  the phrase  \"after any\r\n\nreduction    . . .   under   section   403(a)\"   in   section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A).   The  Commissioner contends  that this  phrase\r\n\nspecifically    instructs    that    the   reduction    under\r\n\nsection 403(a)  for  compliance   with  the  family   maximum\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nprovision  be computed  before any  reduction is  taken under\r                                          \r\n\nsection 402(k)(3)(A),  and that,  therefore, for  purposes of\r\n\nsection  403(a), Adriana  Parisi's  spousal benefits  must be\r\n\ntreated (contrary to fact) as if they were fully payable.\r\n\n         The Commissioner  reads  too  much into  the  phrase\r\n\n\"after any  reduction . . .  under section 403(a).\"   Section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A) is triggered when  an individual who is entitled\r\n\nto  old-age benefits on  her own  social security  record (as\r\n\nAdriana  is in this case)  is also facially  entitled to some\r                                              \r\n\nother simultaneous benefit (in this case, spousal benefits on\r\n\nParisi's  account).   In substance, section  402(k)(3)(A) has\r\n\nthe  effect  of authorizing  such  an  individual to  receive\r\n\npayment of  the larger of the two  simultaneous benefits, but\r\n\nnot  both.4   Thus, section  402(k)(3)(A) requires  comparing\r\n\nthe size  of the beneficiary's  \"other\" benefit with  her own\r\n\nold-age  benefit.   The  \"after any  reduction under  section\r\n\n403(a)\"  language in  section  402(k)(3)(A) ensures  that, in\r\n\ndetermining the amount of the \"other\" simultaneous benefit in\r\n\nquestion,  the  calculation  will   take  into  account   any\r\n\nreduction  to the  \"other\"  benefit that  would otherwise  be\r\n\nrequired  under section  403(a).   This prevents  the old-age\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  More precisely, the provision entitles the beneficiary to\r\npayment of  her old-age  benefit plus the  difference between\r                                                 \r\nthe  \"other\"  benefit  and   the  old-age  benefit,  if  that\r\ndifference is greater than zero.  This is the same  as saying\r\nthat  the beneficiary is entitled  to an amount  equal to the\r\nlarger of the two simultaneous benefits in question.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nbeneficiary from receiving, by operation  of the simultaneous\r\n\nbenefits  provision,  any  amount  of  benefits   that  would\r\n\notherwise be excluded as exceeding the cap imposed by section\r\n\n403(a).5\r\n\n         There  is  nothing   in  the  language  of   section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A) or  section 403(a), however, that  dictates that\r\n\nthe family  maximum computation cannot take  into account the\r\n\nfact that  an entitlement  that would normally  contribute to\r\n\nthe  family maximum  amount  has  been  reduced  to  zero  by\r\n\noperation of  the simultaneous benefits  provision of section\r\n\n402(k)(3)(A).  It is true that the computation required under\r\n\nsection  402(k)(3)(A)  requires  a provisional  determination\r\n\nwhether  the  \"other\" simultaneous  benefit  (here, Adriana's\r\n\nspousal benefits) would, if  payable, be subject to reduction\r\n\nunder section 403(a).  But this computation is only necessary\r\n\nfor the  purpose  of  determining what  portion  of  the  two\r\n\nsimultaneous  benefits the beneficiary  (Adriana) is entitled\r\n\nto receive.   There is  no language in  section 402(k)(3)(A),\r\n\nand  certainly  not in  section  403(a),  requiring that  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Suppose,   for   example,    that   a   beneficiary    is\r\nsimultaneously entitled to receive her own old-age benefit of\r\namount  B and a  spousal benefit of  amount S.   Suppose also\r\nthat if the spousal benefit were payable, the family  maximum\r\ncap would be exceeded,  and the spousal benefit (S)  would be\r\nreduced by the  amount of the statutory  reduction, to amount\r\nS(r).    The  \"after   any  reduction\"  language  in  section\r\n402(k)(3)(A)  ensures that  the beneficiary  will receive  an\r\namount equal  to the larger  of B and  the reduced S(r),  not\r                                                                         \r\nsimply the larger of B and S.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nfamily maximum  computation ignore the actual  results of the\r                                              \r\n\nsimultaneous benefits determination of section 402(k)(3)(A).\r\n\n         To the contrary, the statutory language  suggests an\r\n\ninterplay  between  section 403(a)  and  section 402(k)(3)(A)\r\n\nthat  belies  the  position  advanced  by  the  Commissioner.\r\n\nSection 403(a)  requires only such \"reduc[tion]  as necessary\r                                                                         \r\n\nso as not to  exceed\" the family maximum.   The determination\r\n\nof whether a reduction is necessary in this case depends upon\r\n\nthe  calculation of  the  \"total monthly  benefits\" to  which\r\n\nAdriana Parisi \"may  be entitled  under section  402\" on  the\r\n\nbasis of her husband's SSA record.  As explained, that amount\r\n\nis  zero.    Hence,  the relevant  \"total  monthly  benefits\"\r                    \r\n\navailable under section 402 on Parisi's work record (combined\r\n\nwith  Parisi's  own benefits)  do  not  exceed the  statutory\r\n\nceiling.  It cannot be \"necessary,\" then, to reduce Anthony's\r\n\nbenefits.\r\n\n         We  conclude that  the Commissioner's  position does\r\n\nnot follow  from the  plain language of  section 402(k)(3)(A)\r\n\nand section 403(a).\r\n\nB.  Legislative History\r                                   \r\n\n         As the district court  observed, the  interpretation\r\n\nurged  by the  Commissioner produces  a result  that Congress\r\n\napparently   sought  to   avoid.     The  most   illuminating\r\n\nlegislative  comments  are  found   in  connection  with  the\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nenactment of the  1949 amendments to  the SSA, which  changed\r\n\nthe previously existing family maximum provision:\r\n\n         Under the  present  law,  the total  of  the\r\n         family benefits  for a  month is reduced  to\r\n         the  maximum  permitted by  section [403(a)]\r\n         prior  to any  deductions on  account of the\r\n         occurrence of  any  event specified  in  the\r\n         law . . . .  Section [403(a)] as amended  by\r\n         the   bill   reverses  this   procedure  and\r\n         provides that  the  reduction in  the  total\r\n         benefits for  a month  is to  be made  after\r\n         the deductions.   As a result, larger family\r\n         benefits will be payable in many cases.\r\n\nS. Rep. No. 1669,  81st Cong., 2d Sess.

We add,\r                                           \r\n\nhowever, as  a  capstone to  our  analysis, that  the  Social\r\n\nSecurity Administration's  own regulations are  at odds  with\r\n\nits  proposed construction  of the  statute.   The regulation\r\n\nthat  describes generally  the effect  of the  family maximum\r\n\nprovision explains its operation in this way:\r\n\n         Family Maximum.   As explained in   404.403,\r                                   \r\n         there  is  a  maximum  amount  set  for each\r\n         insured   person's  earnings   record   that\r\n         limits the  total benefits  payable on  that\r                                                        \r\n         record.  If you are entitled  to benefits as\r\n         the  insured's  dependent or  survivor, your\r\n         benefits  may   be  reduced  to  keep  total\r                                                                 \r\n         benefits  payable  to  the insured's  family\r                                      \r\n         within these limits.\r\n\n20 C.F.R.   404.304(d) (emphasis added).  The regulation that\r\n\nmore  specifically  describes  the operation  of  the  family\r\n\nmaximum provision contains similar language:\r\n\n         The Social  Security Act  limits the  amount\r\n         of  monthly benefits  that can  be  paid for\r                                                             \r\n         any  month  based  on  the  earnings  of  an\r\n         insured individual.\r\n\n20 C.F.R.   404.403(a)(1) (emphasis added).\r\n\n         The agency's  own  interpretative  regulations  thus\r\n\ninterpret the family maximum  provision as operating to limit\r\n\nthe  \"amount  of  benefits that  can  be  paid\"  on a  single\r                                                          \r\n\nworker's account.  They do not state that section 403(a) caps\r\n\nthe total amount of  entitlements that might be available  on\r                                             \r\n\nan   account.    That  the  agency  has  chosen  in  its  own\r\n\nregulations  to  describe the  family  maximum  as placing  a\r\n\nceiling on  benefits paid or  payable casts further  doubt on\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nits  contention here  that section  403(a) is  concerned with\r\n\ncapping  pure  entitlements,  regardless  of  the  amount  of\r                                                    \r\n\npayable benefits that attach.\r\n\n         To  similar  effect is  language  contained  in  the\r\n\nagency's   written   rulings   on   Anthony's   benefits   as\r\n\ncommunicated to  Lorralee Cooney.   In the first  letter from\r\n\nthe Social  Security Administration  to Cooney  notifying her\r\n\nthat  her  son's  benefits  were to  be  reduced,  the agency\r\n\nexplained that the reduction was required because the statute\r\n\nimposes  a \"limit  on how  much we can  pay on  each person's\r                                                       \r\n\nSocial  Security record [emphasis  added].\"  And  later, in a\r\n\nletter    reaffirming    its    initial     decision    after\r\n\nreconsideration, the  agency informed Cooney that  the family\r\n\nmaximum provision  \"limits the  total amount of  the benefits\r\n\npayable on an individual's earnings record.\"\r                   \r\n\n         The regulations  and agency statements quoted  above\r\n\nsupport  the  conclusion  we  adopt here,  namely,  that  the\r\n\n\"family  maximum\"  provision of  section  403(a) operates  to\r\n\nlimit  only  those  benefits that  are  payable  on a  single\r                                                           \r\n\nworker's account.\r\n\nD.  Policy Considerations\r                                     \r\n\n         We  observe,  finally,  that  the  purported  policy\r\n\nreasons offered in support of the Commissioner's construction\r\n\nof the statute lack persuasive force.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n         The agency says its  position prevents families from\r\n\nreceiving duplicative  or excessive benefits.   In this case,\r\n\nthe  Commissioner  asserts,  applying section 403(a)  in  the\r\n\nmanner suggested would  have the effect  of making the  total\r\n\namount  of benefits  payable  to the  \"family unit\"  (Parisi,\r\n\nAnthony,  and Adriana)  roughly  the same  as  it was  before\r\n\nAdriana became entitled to receive her own old-age benefits.\r\n\n         The problem with  this rationale is twofold.  First,\r\n\nthe family maximum provision (despite its common appellation)\r\n\nis written not as  a broad limitation upon the  amount that a\r                          \r\n\nfamily  unit can receive in total SSA benefits, but rather as\r\n\na specific  limitation upon the amount  of benefits available\r\n\non the  basis of  a single  worker's record.   See 20  C.F.R.\r                                                              \r\n\n  404.403(a)(1)  (explaining  that  section  403(a)  places a\r\n\nmaximum \"for  each person's  earnings record that  limits the\r\n\ntotal benefits  payable  on that  record\" (emphasis  added)).\r                                                    \r\n\nAdriana \"earned\" her old age  benefits through her own  years\r\n\nin the work force,  not because she  was the wife of  Parisi.\r\n\nThe question under section 403(a) is not whether the family's\r                                                                       \r\n\nbenefits  have  exceeded a  certain  level,  but whether  the\r\n\nbenefits  payable  on  a single  wage-earner's  account  have\r\n\nexceeded the statutory maximum.\r\n\n         Second, the agency's suggestion  that the  reduction\r\n\nof benefits  to Anthony prevents duplicative  payments to the\r\n\n\"family  unit\" rings hollow.   Anthony lives with his natural\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nmother, not with  Adriana and  Parisi.  The  agency does  not\r\n\nsuggest that  any portion  of Adriana's or  Parisi's benefits\r\n\nreaches the child.   The agency's statement  that \"the family\r\n\nunit  continues  to receive  approximately  the same  overall\r\n\nbenefits as  it did before\"  thus distorts reality.  In fact,\r\n\nunder the agency's interpretation, Anthony receives only half\r\n\nthe benefits he was receiving before; and because neither the\r\n\nfather's  nor Adriana  Parisi's own  benefits are  subject to\r\n\nreduction under  the family maximum provision, it is only the\r                                                                     \r\n\nchild who has been adversely affected  by the agency's action\r\n\nin this case.\r\n\n         The other purported  policy justification offered in\r\n\ndefense of  the Commissioner's position is  that reduction of\r\n\nthe child's benefits in  this case is required to  uphold the\r\n\nmeaning  of  \"entitlement.\"   The Commissioner  contends that\r\n\nbecause section 403(a) places  a limit on \"entitlements,\" and\r\n\nbecause  Adriana Parisi  is  \"entitled\" to  spousal  benefits\r\n\nunder  one  subsection  of  the statute  (even  though  those\r\n\nbenefits  are not  payable),  failure to  include those  non-\r\n\npayable  benefits in the family maximum tally will dilute the\r\n\nmeaning of \"entitlement\" under the SSA.\r\n\n         We find  this reasoning  unpersuasive.   The flaw in\r\n\nthis  argument is the same  as the flaw  underlying its plain\r\n\nmeaning argument:  it incorrectly assumes that section 403(a)\r\n\nis concerned  with  keeping  pure  \"entitlements\"  under  the\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nstatutory limit.   To the  contrary, as  we concluded  above,\r\n\nsection 403(a)  operates  in this  case  to limit  the  total\r\n\namount of  benefits payable on a  single wage-earner's record\r                                       \r\n\nunder the relevant benefits provisions (read as a whole), not\r\n\nto  limit  entitlements  theoretically  available  under  one\r\n\nsubsection of the statute considered in artificial isolation.\r\n\nIn   any  event,   although  this   conclusion  negates   the\r\n\nCommissioner's  claim  that   Adriana  Parisi's   non-payable\r\n\nspousal  benefits  must be  included  in  the family  maximum\r\n\ncalculation,   it   does    not   directly   undermine    the\r\n\nCommissioner's purported definition of \"entitlement,\"  nor is\r\n\nit  necessarily inconsistent  with saying  here  that Adriana\r\n\nParisi  has,  in some  abstract  sense,  an \"entitlement\"  to\r\n\nspousal benefits  under section  402(b)(1) read  in isolation\r\n\nfrom the rest  of section 402.   We hold only  that Adriana's\r\n\nnon-payable spousal benefits do  not count toward the section\r\n\n403(a) \"family maximum.\"\r\n\nE.  Conclusion\r                          \r\n\n         We  conclude   that  the   Commissioner's   proposed\r\n\nconstruction  of  section  403(a)  is not  supported  by  the\r\n\nlanguage of the statute, is logically flawed, is inconsistent\r\n\nwith  the  statute's  intended  effect, is  contrary  to  the\r\n\nagency's own interpretative regulations, and is not supported\r\n\nby  any sound considerations  of policy.   Accordingly, we do\r\n\nnot defer to the Commissioner's position under the principles\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nof Chevron, and we hold that section 403(a) operates to limit\r                      \r\n\nthe total  amount of  benefits actually payable  on a  single\r                                                           \r\n\nworker's record, not the amount of entitlements theoretically\r\n\navailable.6\r\n\n         In this case, because Adriana Parisi's \"entitlement\"\r\n\nunder section 402(b)(1) to  spousal benefits on Parisi's work\r\n\nrecord  produces zero  payable benefits  as a  result  of the\r                                          \r\n\noperation  of  section  402(k)(3)(A),  no such  benefits  are\r\n\nincluded  in the  computation required  under section 403(a).\r\n\nConsequently,  the total  amount of  benefits payable  on the\r\n\nbasis of  Parisi's work  record does not  exceed the  maximum\r\n\nimposed  by  the  statute,  and it  is  not  \"necessary\"  for\r\n\npurposes of section 403(a) to reduce Anthony's benefits.  The\r\n\ndistrict court correctly reversed  the decision of the Social\r\n\nSecurity Appeals Council.\r\n\n         Affirmed.\r                             \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Our reasoning differs from  that employed by the district\r\ncourt.   The district  court's analysis distinguished between\r\n\"effective\"   and   \"conditional\"    entitlements.       This\r\ndistinction, although sensible, has no roots in the statutory\r\nlanguage.   We  rely, instead,  on  the notion  that  section\r\n403(a) places  a limit  not  upon non-payable  \"entitlements\"\r\ncreated  by  an  isolated subsection  of  the  SSA,  but upon\r\npayable benefits    in this case, the  total benefits yielded\r\nby  section 402 of the SSA  read as a whole.   This notion is\r\nsemantically supported by the  statutory framework and by the\r\nagency's own  regulations, which speak  specifically in terms\r\nof payable benefits (e.g., 20 C.F.R.   404.304(d)).\r                                     \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n</pre>",
