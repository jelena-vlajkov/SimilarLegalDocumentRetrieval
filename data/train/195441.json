This appeal  requires us to\n                                   \n\ndetermine the meaning  of the  term \"disorderly\" as  used in  the\n\nMassachusetts   Alcoholism   Treatment  and   Rehabilitation  Act\n\n(\"Chapter 111B\"), generally known  as the Protective Custody Law,\n\nMass. Gen.  L. ch. 111B,    11 et seq., and  whether the district\n                                      \n\ncourt  appropriately charged  the  jury as  to  the standard  for\n\ndetermining  if the  conduct of  appellant John  Veiga (\"Veiga\"),\n\nduring  the early morning hours  of December 6,  1987, provided a\n\nbasis  for police  officers reasonably  to conclude  that he  was\n\n\"incapacitated\" within the meaning of that statute.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          At  approximately  2:00  a.m.  on  December  6,   1987,\n\nappellant  John Veiga,  a 23-year-old  medical student  at Boston\n\nUniversity  School  of  Medicine,  was  with  a  friend,  Jessica\n\nGoldhirsch (\"Goldhirsch\"), in the  front seat of Goldhirsch's car\n\nwhen Officers John McGee  and David Johnson, who were  on routine\n\npatrol,  drove by and noticed the car.   The car was parked a few\n\nfeet behind several  stores in an otherwise  deserted parking lot\n\nnear the corner of Dudley and Belden streets in Boston.  Near the\n\nparking lot were a few occupied homes and apartment buildings.\n\n          Upon  noticing the  car,  Officer  Johnson  pulled  the\n\npolice wagon he was  driving into the parking lot and  turned the\n\n\"take-down\" lights (a set of bright lights)  on Goldhirsch's car.\n\nOfficer  McGee then  alighted  from the  vehicle, approached  the\n\npassenger side of Goldhirsch's car with a lighted flashlight, and\n\nshined the light into the car.  He proceeded to inquire as to the\n\n                               -2-\n\nownership of the car.  Goldhirsch, who had driven the  car to the\n\nparking  lot and was sitting  in the driver's  seat, produced her\n\nlicense and the registration, while Veiga remained seated quietly\n\nin the passenger seat of Goldhirsch's car.\n\n          After Officer McGee determined that Goldhirsch's papers\n\nwere in order and gave her back her license and registration, the\n\nofficer walked  over to the passenger's side of the car and asked\n\nVeiga  for identification.  Veiga responded by asking why Officer\n\nMcGee wanted to know his name.  According to the police officers,\n\nVeiga's response was  loud and boisterous.   Officer McGee  again\n\nasked  Veiga to show him  some identification.   Veiga opened the\n\ncar  door,  got  out,  and  said  he  would  not  give  McGee any\n\ninformation.   Officer McGee  testified that  he asked Veiga  six\n\nmore   times  by   saying  \"Sir,   I  just   want  to   see  some\n\nidentification.   I  just want  to know who  you are,  why you're\n\nhere,\" and Veiga  responded similarly  by asking  loudly why  the\n\npolice were asking him questions, and what he had  done wrong. At\n\ntrial, the officers testified that Veiga was \"ranting and raving\"\n\nand  protesting that  the  police had  no right  to  ask him  any\n\nquestions.  This entire colloquy lasted four or five minutes.1\n\n          Eventually,  Officers  McGee  and   Johnson  handcuffed\n\nVeiga, and as  they were  doing this,  informed him  that he  was\n\n                    \n\n1  At trial, Officer Johnson admitted that Veiga was not profane,\nthat he did  not call the officers names, and  that McGee did not\nhave to  raise his voice to  be heard over Veiga.   Officer McGee\nalso admitted that Veiga was rational and coherent.\n\n                               -3-\n\nbeing  placed in protective custody.2   They then  led Veiga into\n\nthe  police wagon and  drove him to  the station.   Veiga did not\n\nresist being handcuffed or being led into the wagon.\n\n          The officers maintain that during their  encounter with\n\nVeiga, he was unsteady on his feet, gesturing with his arms, that\n\nhis  speech was  slurred  and that  he  was emitting  an odor  of\n\nalcohol from his person and  his breath.3  At the  station, Veiga\n\ndenied that he  had been drinking and said that  the officers had\n\nno reason to take him to the station and no reason to ask him who\n\nhe was and why he was in the parking lot.\n\n          At the station, Officer McGee spoke with Goldhirsch and\n\ninformed her  that the  police were going  to hold  Veiga at  the\n\nstation.   Veiga was  placed in  a cell  with another person  and\n\nreleased at approximately 8:OO o'clock that morning.\n\n          Veiga subsequently brought this action against Officers\n\nMcGee and Johnson, and  against the City of Boston  (the \"City\").\n\nIn  his complaint, Veiga  alleged that the  officers violated his\n\nrights  under the  United States  Constitution and  state law  by\n\n                    \n\n2   At trial, Officers McGee and  Johnson both admitted that they\ndid  not  suspect  either Goldhirsch  or  Veiga  of any  specific\ncriminal activity that night.\n\n3    Whether  the police  officers  had  a  reasonable basis  for\nconcluding  that Veiga  was  intoxicated was  a highly  contested\nissue  at trial.   Veiga  contends  that he  did not  consume any\nalcoholic  beverages between  the evening of  December 5  and the\nearly  morning   hours  of  December  6.    The  record  contains\nsubstantial evidence that while at the medical school on December\n5, Veiga studied histology and dissected a cadaver and that these\nactivities  brought  him  into contact  with  several  chemicals,\nincluding acetone, which could  have accounted for odors emitting\nfrom his body.\n\n                               -4-\n\nseizing  him without  justification.    Specifically, Veiga  sued\n\nOfficers  McGee and Johnson under 42 U.S.C.   1983 for violations\n\nof his federal civil rights, including his First  Amendment right\n\nto freedom of  expression and  his Fourth Amendment  right to  be\n\nfree  from  unlawful  seizure.   Veiga  also  brought  claims for\n\nbattery; for false imprisonment;  and for infliction of emotional\n\ndistress.   Veiga  also sued  the City  for negligence  under the\n\nMassachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258.4\n\n          At  trial, both  Officers Mcgee  and Johnson  testified\n\nthat they told Veiga he could take a breathalyzer examination and\n\nthat if he passed the  test, he would be released.   According to\n\nOfficer  Johnson, Veiga replied that  he was not  drunk, that the\n\npolice  were going  to have to  prove he  was drunk,  and that he\n\nwould  not take  any test.   The  officers further  maintain that\n\nVeiga  refused to sign the  protective custody form  in the space\n\nlabeled  \"I was  informed of  my right  to a  breathalyzer test.\"\n\nVeiga testified that he was never informed of his right to take a\n\nbreathalyzer test.5\n\n                    \n\n4  Veiga also raised  other civil rights claims against the  City\nbased on  various alleged customs,  policies and practices.   The\nCourt  sua  sponte severed  these  claims for  a  separate trial.\n                  \nThese claims are not part of this appeal.\n\n5  Chapter 111B,   8 provides in part:\n\n            Any  person assisted by  a police officer\n            to a police station shall have the right,\n            and be informed in writing of said right,\n            to   request   and   be  administered   a\n            breathalyzer test.  . . .   If any person\n            who is administered a  breathalyzer test,\n            under  this  section,  and evidence  from\n            said test indicates  that the  percentage\n\n                               -5-\n\n          The jury specifically found that the officers failed to\n\ninform  Veiga of the reasons he was regarded as incapacitated and\n\nof   what  he would  have to  do to  be released  from protective\n\ncustody.\n\n          On  all charges, however,  the jury  found in  favor of\n\nOfficers  McGee and  Johnson  and  the  City  of  Boston.6    The\n\n                    \n\n            of alcohol in his blood is more than five\n            one   hundredths   there   shall  be   no\n            presumption  made  based  solely  on  the\n            breathalyzer  test.   In such  instance a\n            reasonable test of coordination or speech\n            coherency   must   be   administered   to\n            determine if said person  is intoxicated.\n            Only  when such  test of  coordination or\n            speech coherency indicates said person is\n            intoxicated   shall   he  be   placed  in\n            protective custody at a police station or\n            transferred to a facility.\n\n6  The jury answered the special verdict form as follows: \n\n            (1)  Was  John  Veiga put  in  protective\n            custody  without  a  reasonable basis  to\n            believe he was  incapacitated? \"No\";  (2)\n            Has John  Veiga proven that  the exercise\n            of  his  right  not  to  answer questions\n            and/or  his right to oppose verbally, the\n            actions of  the police was  a substantial\n            factor in  the decision  to place  him in\n            protective  custody?  \"No\";  (3)   Was  a\n            battery  committed  on John  Veiga? \"No\";\n            (4)  Was  excessive  force  used  on John\n            Veiga?  \"No\";  (5)  Did  either  or  both\n            defendants intentionally cause John Veiga\n            emotional distress? \"No\"; (6) Did  one or\n            more police  officers acting individually\n            or  jointly,   negligently  deprive  John\n            Veiga of his right to (a) be administered\n            a   breathalyzer   test?  \"No\";   (b)  be\n            released  from  protective  custody  when\n            there was no longer a reasonable basis to\n            believe   he  was   incapacitated?  \"No\";\n            (7)(a)  Did John  McGee or  David Johnson\n            fail to inform John Veiga of the  reasons\n            he was regarded as incapacitated and what\n\n                               -6-\n\ndistrict court subsequently denied Veiga's \"Motion For a Judgment\n\nas a Matter of Law or, in  the Alternative, for a New Trial.\"  On\n\nappeal, Veiga contends  that he  is entitled to  judgment in  his\n\nfavor.  Alternatively,  he contends that  errors in the  district\n\ncourt's instructions to the jury entitle him to a new trial.\n\n                    THE PROTECTIVE CUSTODY LAW\n                                              \n\n          Under Chapter  111B, \"[a]ny person who is incapacitated\n\nmay be assisted  by a police officer with or  without his consent\n\nto his residence,  to a facility or to a  police station.\"  Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch.  111B,   8.    In its  definitional section, the  law\n\ndefines  \"incapacitated\"  as  \"the  condition  of an  intoxicated\n\nperson  who, by reason of the  consumption of intoxicating liquor\n\nis  (1) unconscious, (2) in need of medical attention, (3) likely\n\nto  suffer  or cause  physical harm  or  damage property,  or (4)\n\ndisorderly.\"  Mass. Gen. L. ch.  111B,   3.   Thus, under Chapter\n\n111B,  in order  to take  a person  into protective  custody, the\n\npolice  must  believe that  he  is  both  intoxicated and  either\n                                                         \n\nunconscious, in  need of medical  attention, likely to  suffer or\n\ncause physical harm or damage, or disorderly.\n\n          Veiga   maintains  that  Officers   McGee  and  Johnson\n\nunlawfully  detained him  in  violation of  the First  and Fourth\n\nAmendments  to the United States  Constitution.  On appeal, Veiga\n\n                    \n\n            he would  have to do to  be released from\n            protective custody? \"Yes\"; and  (7)(b) If\n            you  answered  Question  7(a) \"Yes,\"  did\n            John McGee or David Johnson intentionally\n            fail to give John Veiga this information?\n            \"No.\"\n\n                               -7-\n\ncontends that the district  court erred by improperly instructing\n\nthe jury as to the meaning of the term \"disorderly\", as that term\n\nis  used in  the Protective Custody  Law.   See infra p.  14.  He\n                                                     \n\nargues that the district court's erroneous definition of the term\n\n\"disorderly\"  permitted the  jury to  approve Veiga's  seizure by\n\nOfficers McGee and Johnson  simply because he objected loudly  to\n\ntheir  questioning  of him.    He contends  that  this definition\n\nrepresents  a departure  from  Massachusetts  law which  excludes\n\nspeech   and   expressive   conduct  from   the   definition   of\n\n\"disorderly,\"   and  that   the   definition   is,   furthermore,\n\nunconstitutional as violative of the First Amendment.\n\n          We  decide  this case  on  Fourth  Amendment and  state\n\nstatutory grounds rather  than on First Amendment principles.  In\n\ninterpreting  Chapter 111B  we  defer to  state court  decisions,\n\nrecognizing that  \"[t]he Supreme Judicial Court,  not this court,\n\nis the authoritative interpreter of state  statutes.\"  Sabetti v.\n                                                              \n\nDiPaolo, 16 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1994); Rundlett  v.

Meaning of the term \"disorderly\" under Massachusetts law\n\n          Well-established  principles of  statutory construction\n\ndictate that when  a statute  includes a term  well-known to  the\n\ncommon law,  courts should presume that  the legislature intended\n\nthe  term  to be  interpreted  as  in  the common  law.    \"[T]he\n\ninterpretation  of well-defined  words .  . .  in the  common law\n\ncarries over to statutes dealing with the same or similar subject\n\nmatter.  . . .   Furthermore, common-law meanings  are assumed to\n\n                               -8-\n\napply  even in  statutes dealing with  new and  different subject\n\nmatter, to the extent that they appear fitting and in the absence\n\nof  evidence  to  indicate  contrary  meaning.\"    2B N.

L. ch. 4,   6 (\"[w]ords and phrases shall be\n        \n\nconstrued  according to  the  common and  approved  usage of  the\n\nlanguage;  but technical words and phrases and such others as may\n\nhave  acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be\n\nconstrued and understood according to such meaning\").\n\n          The  term  \"disorderly\"  is  not  defined  anywhere  in\n\nChapter 111B.   Nevertheless,  the term  \"disorderly\" has  a long\n\ncommon law heritage.  See Alegata v. Commonwealth, 353 Mass. 287,\n                                                 \n\n302,  231  N.E.2d 201,  210-11  (1967)  (the statute  prohibiting\n\ndisorderly conduct \"has had a long history, dating from the early\n\n17th  century\" and  \"recent case  law and legal  scholarship have\n\nnarrowed the scope  of the  prohibition\").  By  not defining  the\n\nterm in  the  statute,  \"the  Legislature  is  presumed  to  have\n\nintended to  incorporate the common law definition . . . at least\n\ninsofar as it  is not inconsistent with the terms  or the purpose\n\nof the statute.\"  Commonwealth v.

The\n                                                \n\ncourt did so because it found that the \"portion of   53 which may\n\nbe  applied   to  'unreasonable  noise   or  offensively   coarse\n\nutterance,  gesture or  display,  or .  . .

The court further stated:\n            \n\n            [I]n order to ensure that the statute  as\n            limited not be susceptible of application\n            to  conduct  which   is  expressive   and\n            therefore   protected    by   the   First\n            Amendment,   we   further  construe   the\n            section   to    relate   exclusively   to\n            activities   which   involve  no   lawful\n            exercise of a First Amendment right.   In\n            this  regard  the  intent  to  cause,  or\n            reckless     disregard     of,     public\n            inconvenience,  annoyance, or  alarm must\n            be  assessed  in  terms  of  whether  the\n            conduct was  engaged  in with  intent  to\n            exercise  a  First  Amendment  right  and\n            whether  the interest  to be  advanced is\n            insignificant   in   comparison  to   the\n            inconvenience,   annoyance,   or    alarm\n            caused.\n\nId.  at   628  (citation  omitted);  see   also  Commonwealth  v.\n                                                             \n\nFeigenbaum,  404  Mass. 471,  473,  536  N.E.2d 325,  327  (1989)\n          \n\n(reaffirming  these principles);  Commonwealth  v.

Gen.  L.\n\nch. 272,    53, as enunciated  in A  Juvenile.   They argue  that\n                                             \n\nunder  Chapter 111B, \"disorderly\" may include making unreasonable\n\nnoise late  at night  in a  residential neighborhood.   Moreover,\n\nthey contend that Veiga's reliance on the definition of the crime\n\nof  disorderly  conduct as  narrowed  from the  Model  Penal Code\n\n                               -11-\n\ndefinition in  A Juvenile is misplaced because  Veiga was neither\n                         \n\narrested nor charged  with the crime of  disorderly conduct under\n\nMass.  Gen.  L.  ch.  272,    53.    Appellees'  argument  is not\n\npersuasive for at least two reasons.\n\n          First,  in the absence  of a statutory  definition of a\n\nterm, the understanding of  that term in an analogous  statute is\n\nan  excellent  guide  to interpretation.    See,  e.g., Burno  v.\n                                                             \n\nCommissioner of Correction, 399 Mass. 111, 120, 503 N.E.2d 16, 22\n                          \n\n(1987); Donnelly v. Contributory  Retirement Appeal Bd., 15 Mass.\n                                                       \n\nApp.  19, 22,  443 N.E.2d  416, 418  (1982).   The fact  that one\n\nstatute is  formally classified  as penal,  whereas the  other is\n\nnot, does not  detract from the former's value as  a guide to the\n\nlatter, or vice versa,  so long as the two statutes are genuinely\n\nanalogous in substance and effect.   Cf. 2B Sutherland  Statutory\n                                                                 \n\nConstruction, supra, at    51.03 (\"Characterization of the object\n                   \n\nor  purpose is  more important  than characterization  of subject\n\nmatter  in  determining whether  different  statutes  are closely\n\nenough  related  to justify  interpreting  one  in light  of  the\n\nother.\").\n\n          The relationship between  the two statutes  we construe\n\nin pari materia  today is a very close one. Chapter 111B replaced\n               \n\nprior  laws  which provided  for  criminal  punishment of  public\n\ninebriants.7  In place of  punishment, Chapter 111B provides  for\n\n                    \n\n7  Section 18, Acts 1971, Ch. 1076, provides as follows:\n\n            Any    existing     ordinance,    by-law,\n            resolution  or  other  legislation  of  a\n            county,     municipality     or     other\n\n                               -12-\n\nthe treatment  and rehabilitation  of alcoholics and  evidences a\n\nconcern for the health and safety of persons incapacitated by the\n\neffects  of  alcohol.8    The law  accomplishes  two  objectives.\n\nFirst, Chapter  111B attempts to get  intoxicated individuals who\n\nengage  in disorderly  conduct  off the  streets, protecting  the\n\npublic until they sober  up -- a goal previously  accomplished by\n\ncriminal statutes.  Second, Chapter 111B looks out for the health\n\nand   safety  of   those  individuals,   attempting  to   protect\n\nincapacitated  persons from  themselves.   Despite its  non-penal\n\nobjectives,  the  effect of  Chapter  111B  is, nevertheless,  to\n\ndeprive the allegedly incapacitated person of his or her liberty,\n\n                    \n\n            jurisdiction   within  the   commonwealth\n            establishing   the   offense  of   public\n            intoxication or any equivalent offense is\n            hereby  repealed.  No  county, city, town\n            or  other  political  subdivision of  the\n            commonwealth   shall   adopt   any   law,\n            ordinance,    by-law,    resolution    or\n            regulation  having the force of law which\n            provides  that   public  intoxication  or\n            being   found   in   any   place   in  an\n            intoxicated condition shall constitute an\n            offense,  a violation  of the  subject of\n            criminal or civil penalties  or sanctions\n            of any  kind or in  any way  inconsistent\n            with  the  provisions   of  chapter   one\n            hundred and eleven B of the General Laws.\n\n8  Chapter  111b,   7 provides for examination  by a physician if\nthere  is any  concern about  the  health or  immediate treatment\nneeds  of  an incapacitated  person  and section  4  contains the\nfollowing language:\n\n            The   department    [of   Health]   shall\n            coordinate  matters affecting  alcoholism\n            in the commonwealth, shall  establish and\n            conduct  a program  for the  treatment of\n            intoxicated persons and  alcoholics . . .\n            their  rehabilitation and  the prevention\n            of alcoholism . . . .\n\n                               -13-\n\nby permitting detention at a police station.  \n\n          There  is  a  second reason  that  appellees'  argument\n\nfails.    Were  we to  find  that  Chapter  111B's definition  of\n\n\"disorderly\" does  not incorporate  a narrow definition  like the\n\ndefinition established  by Massachusetts case  law, Chapter  111B\n\nwould be  unconstitutionally vague  because  \"disorderly\" is  not\n\notherwise  clearly  defined  by the  statute.    \"It  is a  basic\n\nprinciple  of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness\n\nif its prohibitions are not clearly defined.\"  Grayned v.

In  fact,  at trial,\n\nOfficers  McGee  and  Johnson both  admitted  that  they did  not\n\nsuspect  either  Goldhirsch or  Veiga  of  any specific  criminal\n\n                               -19-\n\nactivity.   See  Brown  v. Texas,  443  U.S. 47  (1979)  (finding\n                                \n\nunlawful  seizure  under  the   Fourth  Amendment  and  reversing\n\nconviction  of  an  individual  arrested,  after  he  refused  to\n\nidentify himself and  angrily asserted that  the officers had  no\n\nright to stop him where the officers did not claim to suspect him\n\nof any criminal activity).   Instead, the officers have  asserted\n\nthat  Veiga  was  \"incapacitated\"  and  that  his  detention  was\n\ntherefore authorized under Chapter 111B.\n\n          Whether  the   police  officers  acted   reasonably  in\n\ndetaining Veiga was  a question of fact  for the jury  to decide.\n\nIn  order  for the  jury to  make this  determination, it  had to\n\nunderstand the  circumstances under  which Chapter 111B  does and\n\ndoes  not authorize  detention.   The  jury  was given  a  faulty\n\ninstruction  on  this  score.    Although  Chapter 111B  did  not\n\nauthorize Officers McGee and  Johnson to take Veiga into  custody\n\nfor the manner in which he expressed himself, the court failed to\n              \n\nmake this  clear when instructing  the jury as  to what  it might\n\nconsider  in determining  whether  Veiga was  \"disorderly.\"   See\n                                                                 \n\nsupra pp.  15-16.   Because  of the faulty jury  instruction, the\n     \n\njury's  response to question 2  of the special  verdict form, see\n                                                                 \n\nsupra note 6, cannot be interpreted  as a finding that Veiga  was\n     \n\ndetained  for a permissible reason.    The  jury's response could\n\nhave been tainted by the  misinformation it was given  concerning\n\nthe officers' right to arrest Veiga for disorderliness.  When the\n\njury  was asked whether Veiga  was taken into  custody because he\n\nexercised  his \"right not to answer questions and/or his right to\n\n                               -20-\n\noppose  verbally the  actions of  the police,\"  it may  have been\n\nunder the false impression that  the protection afforded to those\n\nrights  extends to content alone.   Because Chapter  111B did not\n\nauthorize officers to  detain Veiga  for the manner  in which  he\n                                                   \n\nexpressed himself, a detention for that reason would amount to an\n\nunlawful  seizure  under the  Fourth  Amendment  and Veiga  could\n\ntherefore establish a Section 1983 violation.10\n\n          Because the determination of whether Veiga was detained\n\nfor  a valid reason turns  largely on what  state law authorizes,\n\nthe erroneous jury instruction \"could have affected the result of\n\nthe  jury's  deliberations\"  and  therefore  \"necessitates a  new\n\ntrial.\"  Allen v.

But  the negative\n               \nfreedom afforded by the First Amendment may not in itself provide\na positive justification for a Fourth Amendment invasion.\n\n   Furthermore,   we  recognize,  without  deciding,  that  under\ncertain  circumstances,   yelling  at  the  police   could  be  a\nstatutorily proscribed  breach of the  peace and be  a legitimate\nbasis  for detention.  In the present case, however, screaming at\nthe  police,  without  more,  was  not  a  legitimate reason  for\ndetaining  Veiga under the Fourth Amendment.  See Duran, 904 F.2d\n                                                       \nat 1377  (detention of individual yelling  profanities at police,\nwithout more, is not a  legitimate reason for police interference\nwith personal autonomy).  There are specific statutory and common\nlaw provisions  that regulate breaches of the peace.  It seems to\nus that Chapter 111B is not one of them and should not be used to\ncurtail such behavior.   In any event, no evidence  was presented\nto suggest that Veiga did in fact breach the peace.   No evidence\nsuggested that  any neighbors complained  or that a  single light\nwent on in any of  the nearby apartment buildings as a  result of\nVeiga's presence in the parking lot.\n\n                               -21-\n\n1989).\n\n         MOTION FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT\n                                                        \n\n          The denial  of a motion for  a judgment notwithstanding\n\nthe verdict  under  Fed.

This case must\n\nbe  retried because of the  faulty jury instruction,  and, in any\n\nevent, in order to find that the police were justified  in taking\n\nVeiga  into protective custody, the jury need not find that Veiga\n\nwas  \"disorderly.\"  The jury  could alternatively find that Veiga\n\nwas incapacitated  within  the meaning  of  Chapter 111B,  if  by\n\nreason  of intoxicating  liquor, he  was (1) unconscious,  (2) in\n\nneed  of  medical attention,  or (3)  likely  to suffer  or cause\n\nphysical harm  or damage.

Even\n\nthough our  reading of  the record  might lead  us to  agree with\n\nVeiga,  the police officers' claim that Veiga was likely to cause\n\nor suffer harm  presents a question of fact or credibility of the\n\nwitnesses  for  the jury  to decide.   In  deciding a  motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, we \"may not consider the credibility\n\nof  witnesses, resolve  conflicts in  testimony, or  evaluate the\n\nweight of  the evidence.\"  Hendricks,  923 F.2d at 214.   After a\n                                    \n\ncareful review of the record, we must conclude that the evidence,\n\ntaken in the  light most favorable to the officers  and the City,\n\ncould  support a finding that Veiga  was likely to suffer harm or\n\ncause physical  damage to  himself or  someone else.   Therefore,\n\nVeiga is not  entitled to judgment  in his favor  as a matter  of\n\nlaw.\n\n          In  light  of  the improper  jury  instruction defining\n\n\"disorderly\" within the  meaning of Chapter  111B, we vacate  the\n\njudgment in this case and remand for a new trial consistent  with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n          Vacated and remanded for a new trial.\n                                              \n\n                               -23-\n",

The car was parked a few feet behind several stores in an otherwise deserted parking lot near the corner of Dudley and Belden streets in Boston.  Near the parking lot were a few occupied homes and apartment buildings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon noticing the car, Officer Johnson pulled the police wagon he was driving into the parking lot and turned the \"take-down\" lights (a set of bright lights) on Goldhirsch's car.  Officer McGee then alighted from the vehicle, approached the passenger side of Goldhirsch's car with a lighted flashlight, and shined the light into the car.  He proceeded to inquire as to the ownership of the car.  Goldhirsch, who had driven the car to the parking lot and was sitting in the driver's seat, produced her license and the registration, while Veiga remained seated quietly in the passenger seat of Goldhirsch's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Officer McGee determined that Goldhirsch's papers were in order and gave her back her license and registration, the officer walked over to the passenger's side of the car and asked Veiga for identification.  Veiga responded by asking why Officer McGee wanted to know his name.  According to the police officers, Veiga's response was loud and boisterous.  Officer McGee again asked Veiga to show him some identification.  Veiga opened the car door, got out, and said he would not give McGee any information.  Officer McGee testified that he asked Veiga six more times by saying \"Sir, I just want to see some identification.  I just want to know who you are, why you're here,\" and Veiga responded similarly by asking loudly why the police were asking him questions, and what he had done wrong.  At trial, the officers testified that Veiga was \"ranting and raving\" and protesting that the police had no right to ask him any questions.  This entire colloquy lasted four or five minutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Officers McGee and Johnson handcuffed Veiga, and as they were doing this, informed him that he was being placed in protective custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  They then led Veiga into the police wagon and drove him to the station.  Veiga did not resist being handcuffed or being led into the wagon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers maintain that during their encounter with Veiga, he was unsteady on his feet, gesturing with his arms, that his speech was slurred and that he was emitting an odor of alcohol from his person and his breath.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  At the station, Veiga denied that he had been drinking and said that the officers had no reason to take him to the station and no reason to ask him who he was and why he was in the parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the station, Officer McGee spoke with Goldhirsch and informed her that the police were going to hold Veiga at the station.

In his complaint, Veiga alleged that the officers violated his rights under the United States Constitution and state law by seizing him without justification.  Specifically, Veiga sued Officers McGee and Johnson under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 for violations of his federal civil rights, including his First Amendment right to freedom of expression and his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful seizure.  Veiga also brought claims for battery;  for false imprisonment;  and for infliction of emotional distress.  Veiga also sued the City for negligence under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 258.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, both Officers Mcgee and Johnson testified that they told Veiga he could take a breathalyzer examination and that if he passed the test, he would be released.  According to Officer Johnson, Veiga replied that he was not drunk, that the police were going to have to prove he was drunk, and that he would not take any test.  The officers further maintain that Veiga refused to sign the protective custody form in the space labeled \"I was informed of my right to a breathalyzer test.\"   Veiga testified that he was never informed of his right to take a breathalyzer test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury specifically found that the officers failed to inform Veiga of the reasons he was regarded as incapacitated and of what he would have to do to be released from protective custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On all charges, however, the jury found in favor of Officers McGee and Johnson and the City of Boston.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The district court subsequently denied Veiga's \"Motion For a Judgment as a Matter of Law or, in the Alternative, for a New Trial.\"   On appeal, Veiga contends that he is entitled to judgment in his favor.  Alternatively, he contends that errors in the district court's instructions to the jury entitle him to a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE PROTECTIVE CUSTODY LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Chapter 111B, \"[a]ny person who is incapacitated may be assisted by a police officer with or without his consent to his residence, to a facility or to a police station.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 111B, Sec. 8.  In its definitional section, the law defines \"incapacitated\" as \"the condition of an intoxicated person who, by reason of the consumption of intoxicating liquor is (1) unconscious, (2) in need of medical attention, (3) likely to suffer or cause physical harm or damage property, or (4) disorderly.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 111B, Sec. 3.  Thus, under Chapter 111B, in order to take a person into protective custody, the police must believe that he is both intoxicated and either unconscious, in need of medical attention, likely to suffer or cause physical harm or damage, or disorderly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Veiga maintains that Officers McGee and Johnson unlawfully detained him in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  On appeal, Veiga contends that the district court erred by improperly instructing the jury as to the meaning of the term \"disorderly\", as that term is used in the Protective Custody Law.  See infra p. 1212.  He argues that the district court's erroneous definition of the term \"disorderly\" permitted the jury to approve Veiga's seizure by Officers McGee and Johnson simply because he objected loudly to their questioning of him.  He contends that this definition represents a departure from Massachusetts law which excludes speech and expressive conduct from the definition of \"disorderly,\" and that the definition is, furthermore, unconstitutional as violative of the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decide this case on Fourth Amendment and state statutory grounds rather than on First Amendment principles.

Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction Sec. 50.03 at 103 (5th ed. 1992);  see also Mass.Gen.L. ch. 4, Sec. 6 (\"[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language;  but technical words and phrases and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"disorderly\" is not defined anywhere in Chapter 111B.  Nevertheless, the term \"disorderly\" has a long common law heritage.  See Alegata v. Commonwealth, 353 Mass. 287, 302, 231 N.E.2d 201, 210-11 (1967) (the statute prohibiting disorderly conduct \"has had a long history, dating from the early 17th century\" and \"recent case law and legal scholarship have narrowed the scope of the prohibition\").  By not defining the term in the statute, \"the Legislature is presumed to have intended to incorporate the common law definition ... at least insofar as it is not inconsistent with the terms or the purpose of the statute.\"  Commonwealth v. Ricardo, 26 Mass.App.Ct. 345, 356, 526 N.E.2d 1340, 1347 (1988) (internal quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts courts have defined the term \"disorderly\" in other contexts.  In Alegata, 353 Mass. at 303, 231 N.E.2d at 210-11, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, interpreting the term \"disorderly\" within the meaning of the Massachusetts statute providing for criminal punishment of disorderly persons, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 272, Sec. 53, approved the following Model Penal Code definition of the offense of disorderly conduct for use in Massachusetts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he:  (a) engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior;  or (b) makes unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture or display, or addresses abusive language to any person present;  or (c) creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 368 Mass. 580, 334 N.E.2d 617 (1975), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, interpreting the same statute, significantly limited the definition of \"disorderly\" by striking subsection (b) from the Model Penal Code language imported by Alegata into Sec. 53.  The court did so because it found that the \"portion of Sec. 53 which may be applied to 'unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture or display, or ... [addressing] abusive language to any person present' \" was unconstitutionally overbroad.  A Juvenile, 368 Mass. at 586, 334 N.E.2d at 622.   Specifically, the court found subsection (b) constitutionally untenable because it was \"not sufficiently narrowly and precisely drawn to ensure that it reach only that speech which the state has a justifiable and compelling interest in regulating.\"  Id.  After striking subsection (b), the court concluded that \"as reaching to conduct (other than expressive conduct), the ... [remaining] provision is neither unconstitutionally overbroad nor vague.\"  Id.  The court further stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>[I]n order to ensure that the statute as limited not be susceptible of application to conduct which is expressive and therefore protected by the First Amendment, we further construe the section to relate exclusively to activities which involve no lawful exercise of a First Amendment right.  In this regard the intent to cause, or reckless disregard of, public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm must be assessed in terms of whether the conduct was engaged in with intent to exercise a First Amendment right and whether the interest to be advanced is insignificant in comparison to the inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm caused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. 334 N.E.2d at 628 (citation omitted);  see also Commonwealth v. Feigenbaum, 404 Mass. 471, 473, 536 N.E.2d 325, 327 (1989) (reaffirming these principles);  Commonwealth v. Richards, 369 Mass. 443, 445, 446 n. 2, 340 N.E.2d 892, 896 n. 2 (1976) (expressive conduct cannot be sanctioned as disorderly conduct).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees contend that the definition of \"disorderly\" as used in non-penal Chapter 111B is not the same definition of \"disorderly\" applied to the criminal statute, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 272, Sec. 53, as enunciated in A Juvenile.   They argue that under Chapter 111B, \"disorderly\" may include making unreasonable noise late at night in a residential neighborhood.  Moreover, they contend that Veiga's reliance on the definition of the crime of disorderly conduct as narrowed from the Model Penal Code definition in A Juvenile is misplaced because Veiga was neither arrested nor charged with the crime of disorderly conduct under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 272, Sec. 53.  Appellees' argument is not persuasive for at least two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in the absence of a statutory definition of a term, the understanding of that term in an analogous statute is an excellent guide to interpretation.  See, e.g., Burno v. Commissioner of Correction, 399 Mass. 111, 120, 503 N.E.2d 16, 22 (1987);  Donnelly v. Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 15 Mass.App. 19, 22, 443 N.E.2d 416, 418 (1982).  The fact that one statute is formally classified as penal, whereas the other is not, does not detract from the former's value as a guide to the latter, or vice versa, so long as the two statutes are genuinely analogous in substance and effect.  Cf. 2B Sutherland Statutory Construction, supra, at Sec. 51.03 (\"Characterization of the object or purpose is more important than characterization of subject matter in determining whether different statutes are closely enough related to justify interpreting one in light of the other.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relationship between the two statutes we construe in pari materia today is a very close one.  Chapter 111B replaced prior laws which provided for criminal punishment of public inebriants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In place of punishment, Chapter 111B provides for the treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics and evidences a concern for the health and safety of persons incapacitated by the effects of alcohol.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The law accomplishes two objectives.  First, Chapter 111B attempts to get intoxicated individuals who engage in disorderly conduct off the streets, protecting the public until they sober up--a goal previously accomplished by criminal statutes.  Second, Chapter 111B looks out for the health and safety of those individuals, attempting to protect incapacitated persons from themselves.  Despite its non-penal objectives, the effect of Chapter 111B is, nevertheless, to deprive the allegedly incapacitated person of his or her liberty, by permitting detention at a police station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a second reason that appellees' argument fails.  Were we to find that Chapter 111B's definition of \"disorderly\" does not incorporate a narrow definition like the definition established by Massachusetts case law, Chapter 111B would be unconstitutionally vague because \"disorderly\" is not otherwise clearly defined by the statute.  \"It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.\"  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2299, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972).  \"[I]f arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.\"  Id.  In the absence of clear legislative intent, we will not adopt an interpretation of a statute that would render it constitutionally suspect.  United States v. Thompson, 452 F.2d 1333, 1337 (D.C.Cir.1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 998, 92 S.Ct. 1251, 31 L.Ed.2d 467 (1972);   see also Alegata, 353 Mass. at 290, 231 N.E.2d at 203 (a \"statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score\") (citation and internal quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the term \"disorderly\" should be interpreted in accordance with the definition given that term by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in the case of A Juvenile and its progeny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury as to the term \"disorderly\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Whether a person is disorderly depends on his conduct and the time, place and manner of his speech ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purpose of this case, however, the law does not allow police officers to take the content of what was said into account in deciding whether Mr. Veiga was disorderly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More specifically, in this case Mr. Veiga was engaged in disorderly conduct if when a person causes public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm or acting recklessly to create a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm he engaged in what is called multiple behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context recklessness means acting with a conscious disregard of substantial and unjustifiable risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.  Multiple behavior is excessively unreasonable annoyance which creates a public nuisance.  This would include excessively unreasonable noise late at night in a residential neighborhood so that people in the privacy of their homes are unable to avoid that noise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may include all of the facts and circumstances of this case, including the reasons for any noise in deciding whether it was, among other things, excessively unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be unlawful for the police officers to detain Mr. Veiga for refusing to answer their questions or for challenging them.  They could, however, take into account his conduct and the manner in which he expressed himself but not the content of what he said or the language that he used in deciding whether he was incapacitated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly instructed the jury that \"[i]t would be unlawful for the police officers to detain Mr. Veiga for refusing to answer their questions or for challenging them.\"   See Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 461, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2509, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987) (\"the First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers\");  Norwell v. Cincinnati, 414 U.S. 14, 94 S.Ct. 187, 38 L.Ed.2d 170 (1973) (per curiam ) (reversing conviction for disorderly conduct where defendant was \"loud and boisterous,\" stating that a person \"is not to be punished for nonprovocatively voicing his objection to what he obviously felt was a highly questionable detention by a police officer\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's definition of \"disorderly,\" however, would permit a jury to find that persons are \"disorderly\" based solely on the manner in which they express themselves.  This definition contravenes A Juvenile, in which the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court expressly excised from \"disorderly\" analysis both \"speech and expressive conduct.\"  A Juvenile, 368 Mass. at 593, 334 N.E.2d at 625.   After all, if the SJC thought that protected speech uttered in a loud voice could lawfully be regulated, then it would not have felt compelled to extricate the \"mak[ing of] unreasonable noise\" from the definition of disorderly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's definition also contravenes Massachusetts court interpretations of the term \"tumultuous behavior\" of subsection (c) of the Model Penal Code definition of \"disorderly.\"   Massachusetts courts have upheld convictions for disorderly conduct only where \"defendants' conduct--independent of any speech or expressive conduct--\" warranted the conviction.  Commonwealth v. Carson, 10 Mass.App.Ct. 920, 411 N.E.2d 1337 (1980);  see also Richards, 340 N.E.2d at 896 (\"evidence that the defendants engaged in fighting and violent or tumultuous behavior, entirely apart from any speech of theirs [warranted submission of disorderly conduct complaints] to the jury with instructions, inter alia, that the speech of the defendants was not to be considered as evidence of guilt\");  United States v. Pasqualino, 768 F.Supp. 13 (D.Mass.1991) (rejecting contention that person was \"unruly and tumultuous\" where arrest was grounded solely on the conclusion that the defendant was loud, and, consequently, that he created a disturbance).  In any event, Veiga's behavior cannot conceivably be brought within the SJC's careful definition of tumultuous behavior as \"involving riotous commotion and excessively unreasonable noise so as to constitute a public nuisance.\"  A Juvenile, 334 N.E.2d at 628.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, by instructing the jury that \"disorderly\" included creating \"excessively unreasonable noise late at night in a residential neighborhood so that people in the privacy of their homes are unable to avoid that noise,\" the court improperly imported into the definition of \"disorderly\" elements of the offense of disturbing the peace.  In criminal law, the crime of disturbing the peace is distinct from that of disorderly conduct.  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 272, Sec. 53;  Alegata, 353 Mass. at 302, 231 N.E.2d at 210 (\"Section 53 explicitly differentiates 'idle and disorderly' from 'disturbers of the peace.' \").  Under Massachusetts law, speech alone does not constitute \"disorderly\" conduct and Chapter 111B does not authorize police to take into protective custody \"disturbers of the peace.\"   See supra note 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE FOURTH AMENDMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment entitles an individual to \"the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.\"  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1873, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1967) (quoting Union Pac.  R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251, 11 S.Ct. 1000, 1001, 35 L.Ed. 734 (1891)).  The Supreme Court has stated that \"this inestimable right of personal security belongs as much to the citizen on the streets of our cities as to the homeowner closeted in his study....\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 9, 88 S.Ct. at 1873.   Unquestionably, Veiga was entitled to the protection of the Fourth Amendment as he stood in the parking lot in Boston.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to justify \"official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen ... the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880 (internal quotation and citations omitted).  It is well established that \"the police [may] not interfere with the freedom of private persons unless it be for specific, legitimate reasons.\"  Duran v. Douglas, 904 F.2d 1372, 1376 (9th Cir.1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the officers have offered no common-law ground for detaining Veiga.  In fact, at trial, Officers McGee and Johnson both admitted that they did not suspect either Goldhirsch or Veiga of any specific criminal activity.  See Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979) (finding unlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment and reversing conviction of an individual arrested, after he refused to identify himself and angrily asserted that the officers had no right to stop him where the officers did not claim to suspect him of any criminal activity).  Instead, the officers have asserted that Veiga was \"incapacitated\" and that his detention was therefore authorized under Chapter 111B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the police officers acted reasonably in detaining Veiga was a question of fact for the jury to decide.  In order for the jury to make this determination, it had to understand the circumstances under which Chapter 111B does and does not authorize detention.  The jury was given a faulty instruction on this score.  Although Chapter 111B did not authorize Officers McGee and Johnson to take Veiga into custody for the manner in which he expressed himself, the court failed to make this clear when instructing the jury as to what it might consider in determining whether Veiga was \"disorderly.\"   See supra p. 1213.  Because of the faulty jury instruction, the jury's response to question 2 of the special verdict form, see supra note 6, cannot be interpreted as a finding that Veiga was detained for a permissible reason.  The jury's response could have been tainted by the misinformation it was given concerning the officers' right to arrest Veiga for disorderliness.  When the jury was asked whether Veiga was taken into custody because he exercised his \"right not to answer questions and/or his right to oppose verbally the actions of the police,\" it may have been under the false impression that the protection afforded to those rights extends to content alone.  Because Chapter 111B did not authorize officers to detain Veiga for the manner in which he expressed himself, a detention for that reason would amount to an unlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment and Veiga could therefore establish a Section 1983 violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the determination of whether Veiga was detained for a valid reason turns largely on what state law authorizes, the erroneous jury instruction \"could have affected the result of the jury's deliberations\" and therefore \"necessitates a new trial.\"  Allen v. Chance Mfg. Co., 873 F.2d 465, 469 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>MOTION FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 is reviewed de novo.  Hendricks &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Daewoo Corp., 923 F.2d 209, 214 (1st Cir.1991).  We may \"grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict only after a determination that the evidence could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion.\"  Id.

We are \"compelled, therefore, even in a close case, to uphold the verdict unless the facts and inferences, when viewed in the light most favorable to the party for whom the jury held, point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could not have arrived at this conclusion.\"  Id.

This case must be retried because of the faulty jury instruction, and, in any event, in order to find that the police were justified in taking Veiga into protective custody, the jury need not find that Veiga was \"disorderly.\"   The jury could alternatively find that Veiga was incapacitated within the meaning of Chapter 111B, if by reason of intoxicating liquor, he was (1) unconscious, (2) in need of medical attention, or (3) likely to suffer or cause physical harm or damage.  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 111B, Sec. 3.  The police officers and the City have not argued that Veiga was either unconscious or in need of medical attention.  They have, however, argued that Veiga was likely to suffer or cause physical harm or damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Veiga argues that their contention that he was at risk of causing harm to himself or to others is merely a belated excuse to try to justify the police officers' actions.  Even though our reading of the record might lead us to agree with Veiga, the police officers' claim that Veiga was likely to cause or suffer harm presents a question of fact or credibility of the witnesses for the jury to decide.  In deciding a motion for judgment as a matter of law, we \"may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"  Hendricks, 923 F.2d at 214.   After a careful review of the record, we must conclude that the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the officers and the City, could support a finding that Veiga was likely to suffer harm or cause physical damage to himself or someone else.  Therefore, Veiga is not entitled to judgment in his favor as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the improper jury instruction defining \"disorderly\" within the meaning of Chapter 111B, we vacate the judgment in this case and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At trial, Officer Johnson admitted that Veiga was not profane, that he did not call the officers names, and that McGee did not have to raise his voice to be heard over Veiga.

See Duran, 904 F.2d at 1377 (detention of individual yelling profanities at police, without more, is not a legitimate reason for police interference with personal autonomy).  There are specific statutory and common law provisions that regulate breaches of the peace.  It seems to us that Chapter 111B is not one of them and should not be used to curtail such behavior.  In any event, no evidence was presented to suggest that Veiga did in fact breach the peace.  No evidence suggested that any neighbors complained or that a single light went on in any of the nearby apartment buildings as a result of Veiga's presence in the parking lot.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The car was parked a few feet behind several stores in an otherwise deserted parking lot near the corner of Dudley and Belden streets in Boston.  Near the parking lot were a few occupied homes and apartment buildings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon noticing the car, Officer Johnson pulled the police wagon he was driving into the parking lot and turned the \"take-down\" lights (a set of bright lights) on Goldhirsch's car.  Officer McGee then alighted from the vehicle, approached the passenger side of Goldhirsch's car with a lighted flashlight, and shined the light into the car.  He proceeded to inquire as to the ownership of the car.  Goldhirsch, who had driven the car to the parking lot and was sitting in the driver's seat, produced her license and the registration, while Veiga remained seated quietly in the passenger seat of Goldhirsch's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Officer McGee determined that Goldhirsch's papers were in order and gave her back her license and registration, the officer walked over to the passenger's side of the car and asked Veiga for identification.  Veiga responded by asking why Officer McGee wanted to know his name.  According to the police officers, Veiga's response was loud and boisterous.  Officer McGee again asked Veiga to show him some identification.  Veiga opened the car door, got out, and said he would not give McGee any information.  Officer McGee testified that he asked Veiga six more times by saying \"Sir, I just want to see some identification.  I just want to know who you are, why you're here,\" and Veiga responded similarly by asking loudly why the police were asking him questions, and what he had done wrong.  At trial, the officers testified that Veiga was \"ranting and raving\" and protesting that the police had no right to ask him any questions.  This entire colloquy lasted four or five minutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Officers McGee and Johnson handcuffed Veiga, and as they were doing this, informed him that he was being placed in protective custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  They then led Veiga into the police wagon and drove him to the station.  Veiga did not resist being handcuffed or being led into the wagon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers maintain that during their encounter with Veiga, he was unsteady on his feet, gesturing with his arms, that his speech was slurred and that he was emitting an odor of alcohol from his person and his breath.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  At the station, Veiga denied that he had been drinking and said that the officers had no reason to take him to the station and no reason to ask him who he was and why he was in the parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the station, Officer McGee spoke with Goldhirsch and informed her that the police were going to hold Veiga at the station.  Veiga was placed in a cell with another person and released at approximately 8:00 o'clock that morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Veiga subsequently brought this action against Officers McGee and Johnson, and against the City of Boston (the \"City\").  In his complaint, Veiga alleged that the officers violated his rights under the United States Constitution and state law by seizing him without justification.  Specifically, Veiga sued Officers McGee and Johnson under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 for violations of his federal civil rights, including his First Amendment right to freedom of expression and his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful seizure.  Veiga also brought claims for battery;  for false imprisonment;  and for infliction of emotional distress.  Veiga also sued the City for negligence under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 258.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, both Officers Mcgee and Johnson testified that they told Veiga he could take a breathalyzer examination and that if he passed the test, he would be released.  According to Officer Johnson, Veiga replied that he was not drunk, that the police were going to have to prove he was drunk, and that he would not take any test.  The officers further maintain that Veiga refused to sign the protective custody form in the space labeled \"I was informed of my right to a breathalyzer test.\"   Veiga testified that he was never informed of his right to take a breathalyzer test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury specifically found that the officers failed to inform Veiga of the reasons he was regarded as incapacitated and of what he would have to do to be released from protective custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On all charges, however, the jury found in favor of Officers McGee and Johnson and the City of Boston.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The district court subsequently denied Veiga's \"Motion For a Judgment as a Matter of Law or, in the Alternative, for a New Trial.\"   On appeal, Veiga contends that he is entitled to judgment in his favor.  Alternatively, he contends that errors in the district court's instructions to the jury entitle him to a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE PROTECTIVE CUSTODY LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Chapter 111B, \"[a]ny person who is incapacitated may be assisted by a police officer with or without his consent to his residence, to a facility or to a police station.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 111B, Sec. 8.  In its definitional section, the law defines \"incapacitated\" as \"the condition of an intoxicated person who, by reason of the consumption of intoxicating liquor is (1) unconscious, (2) in need of medical attention, (3) likely to suffer or cause physical harm or damage property, or (4) disorderly.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 111B, Sec. 3.  Thus, under Chapter 111B, in order to take a person into protective custody, the police must believe that he is both intoxicated and either unconscious, in need of medical attention, likely to suffer or cause physical harm or damage, or disorderly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Veiga maintains that Officers McGee and Johnson unlawfully detained him in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  On appeal, Veiga contends that the district court erred by improperly instructing the jury as to the meaning of the term \"disorderly\", as that term is used in the Protective Custody Law.  See infra p. 1212.  He argues that the district court's erroneous definition of the term \"disorderly\" permitted the jury to approve Veiga's seizure by Officers McGee and Johnson simply because he objected loudly to their questioning of him.  He contends that this definition represents a departure from Massachusetts law which excludes speech and expressive conduct from the definition of \"disorderly,\" and that the definition is, furthermore, unconstitutional as violative of the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decide this case on Fourth Amendment and state statutory grounds rather than on First Amendment principles.

They argue that under Chapter 111B, \"disorderly\" may include making unreasonable noise late at night in a residential neighborhood.  Moreover, they contend that Veiga's reliance on the definition of the crime of disorderly conduct as narrowed from the Model Penal Code definition in A Juvenile is misplaced because Veiga was neither arrested nor charged with the crime of disorderly conduct under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 272, Sec. 53.

See, e.g., Burno v. Commissioner of Correction, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2108020\"><a href=\"/opinion/2108020/burno-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 120, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2108020\"><a href=\"/opinion/2108020/burno-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 22 (1987);  Donnelly v.

The fact that one statute is formally classified as penal, whereas the other is not, does not detract from the former's value as a guide to the latter, or vice versa, so long as the two statutes are genuinely analogous in substance and effect.  Cf. 2B Sutherland Statutory <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Construction,</span> supra</span>, at Sec. 51.03 (\"Characterization of the object or purpose is more important than characterization of subject matter in determining whether different statutes are closely enough related to justify interpreting one in light of the other.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relationship between the two statutes we construe in pari materia today is a very close one.  Chapter 111B replaced prior laws which provided for criminal punishment of public inebriants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In place of punishment, Chapter 111B provides for the treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics and evidences a concern for the health and safety of persons incapacitated by the effects of alcohol.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The law accomplishes two objectives.  First, Chapter 111B attempts to get intoxicated individuals who engage in disorderly conduct off the streets, protecting the public until they sober up--a goal previously accomplished by criminal statutes.  Second, Chapter 111B looks out for the health and safety of those individuals, attempting to protect incapacitated persons from themselves.  Despite its non-penal objectives, the effect of Chapter 111B is, nevertheless, to deprive the allegedly incapacitated person of his or her liberty, by permitting detention at a police station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a second reason that appellees' argument fails.  Were we to find that Chapter 111B's definition of \"disorderly\" does not incorporate a narrow definition like the definition established by Massachusetts case law, Chapter 111B would be unconstitutionally vague because \"disorderly\" is not otherwise clearly defined by the statute.  \"It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.\"  Grayned v.

In order for the jury to make this determination, it had to understand the circumstances under which Chapter 111B does and does not authorize detention.  The jury was given a faulty instruction on this score.  Although Chapter 111B did not authorize Officers McGee and Johnson to take Veiga into custody for the manner in which he expressed himself, the court failed to make this clear when instructing the jury as to what it might consider in determining whether Veiga was \"disorderly.\"   See supra p. 1213.  Because of the faulty jury instruction, the jury's response to question 2 of the special verdict form, see supra note 6, cannot be interpreted as a finding that Veiga was detained for a permissible reason.  The jury's response could have been tainted by the misinformation it was given concerning the officers' right to arrest Veiga for disorderliness.  When the jury was asked whether Veiga was taken into custody because he exercised his \"right not to answer questions and/or his right to oppose verbally the actions of the police,\" it may have been under the false impression that the protection afforded to those rights extends to content alone.  Because Chapter 111B did not authorize officers to detain Veiga for the manner in which he expressed himself, a detention for that reason would amount to an unlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment and Veiga could therefore establish a Section 1983 violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the determination of whether Veiga was detained for a valid reason turns largely on what state law authorizes, the erroneous jury instruction \"could have affected the result of the jury's deliberations\" and therefore \"necessitates a new trial.\"  Allen v.

Even though our reading of the record might lead us to agree with Veiga, the police officers' claim that Veiga was likely to cause or suffer harm presents a question of fact or credibility of the witnesses for the jury to decide.

Veiga contends that he did not consume any alcoholic beverages between the evening of December 5 and the early morning hours of December 6.  The record contains substantial evidence that while at the medical school on December 5, Veiga studied histology and dissected a cadaver and that these activities brought him into contact with several chemicals, including acetone, which could have accounted for odors emitting from his body</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Veiga also raised other civil rights claims against the City based on various alleged customs, policies and practices.

But the negative freedom afforded by the First Amendment may not in itself provide a positive justification for a Fourth Amendment invasion</p>\n        <p>Furthermore, we recognize, without deciding, that under certain circumstances, yelling at the police could be a statutorily proscribed breach of the peace and be a legitimate basis for detention.  In the present case, however, screaming at the police, without more, was not a legitimate reason for detaining Veiga under the Fourth Amendment.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542911\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Duran,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/542911/ralph-duran-husband-alice-duran-wife-v-city-of-douglas-arizona-a-body/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1377</span> </a></span>(detention of individual yelling profanities at police, without more, is not a legitimate reason for police interference with personal autonomy).  There are specific statutory and common law provisions that regulate breaches of the peace.  It seems to us that Chapter 111B is not one of them and should not be used to curtail such behavior.  In any event, no evidence was presented to suggest that Veiga did in fact breach the peace.  No evidence suggested that any neighbors complained or that a single light went on in any of the nearby apartment buildings as a result of Veiga's presence in the parking lot.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
