After  jury trial  in  the  district  court,\n            Per Curiam\n                      \n\ndefendant Leo Hamel was convicted  of violation of 18 U.S.C.    371 of\n\nconspiracy  to  commit  bank  fraud  and  conspiracy  to   make  false\n\nstatements  for the purpose of influencing the actions of Dime Savings\n\nBank, a federally insured bank.  He now appeals his conviction.\n\n            Defendant  originally appealed  on  two grounds.   In  his\n\nbrief, he first argued that the government failed to prove as a matter\n\nof law  that Hamel  knowingly made  a false  statement with  intent to\n\ninfluence a  federally insured financial institution.   As defendant's\n\ncounsel correctly conceded during oral  argument, however, defendant's\n\nargument on this point is precluded by this Court's recent decision in\n\nUnited States  v. Brandon, 17 F.3d  409, 426 (1st Cir.  1994) (\"It has\n                         \n\nbeen established that the government does not have to show the alleged\n\nscheme was  directed  solely toward  a particular  institution; it  is\n                            \n\nsufficient  to show  that  defendant knowingly  executed a  fraudulent\n\nscheme that exposed a federally insured bank to risk of loss.\").  \n\n            This  concession  leaves  us  with  defendant's  remaining\n\nargument on appeal, that  there was insufficient evidence as  a matter\n\nof law to  convict him of conspiracy under   371.  We have stated that\n\nin  assessing a sufficiency challenge, we examine the evidence \"in the\n\nlight  most flattering to the  prosecution (in the  process of drawing\n\nall  reasonable  inferences in  its favor)  so  that we  may ascertain\n\nwhether  the proof  would have  allowed a  rational jury  to determine\n\nbeyond  a reasonable doubt that the defendant  was guilty of the crime\n\ncharged.\"  United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711  (1st Cir. 1992),\n                                 \n\ncert.  denied,     U.S.   ,  113 S.  Ct. 1005  (1993).

For  these reasons,  we  reject defendant's  challenge and\n\naffirm his conviction.  \n\n            Affirmed.\n                    \n\n                                 -3-\n                                  3\n",
