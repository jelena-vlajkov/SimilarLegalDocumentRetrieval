Rodriguez  also  appeals  his  sentence,\r\n\ncontending that  the district court engaged  in impermissible\r\n\n\"double counting\" when it departed upward based on the purity\r\n\nof the  heroin he was  convicted of conspiring  to distribute\r\n\nwhile   simultaneously   enhancing  his   sentence   for  his\r\n\nleadership role.  The conviction and sentence are affirmed.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          Geraldo  \"Jose\"  Rodriguez  and   his  co-defendant\r\n\nJuvenal  Grajales arranged the sale of a total of 97.65 grams\r\n\nof very pure heroin  (87% to 96% pure) to  a DEA confidential\r\n\ninformant named Miguel Teixeira on four occasions in February\r\n\nand April,  1993.   Teixeira recorded his  conversations with\r\n\nRodriguez  about the  particulars of  these drug  deals at  a\r\n\nnumber of  pre-arranged meetings.   At some of  the meetings,\r\n\nRodriguez was accompanied by Grajales or other associates; at\r\n\nothers,   Rodriguez  sent   associates  to  assist   with  or\r\n\nconsummate the transactions.\r\n\n          Rodriguez and Grajales  were arrested and  indicted\r\n\nfor  distribution of  heroin,  distribution  of cocaine,  and\r\n\nconspiracy  to  possess heroin  and  cocaine  with intent  to\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ndistribute.   Following a period of  pretrial motion practice\r\n\nand  discovery (set forth  in the Appendix  that follows this\r\n\nopinion), trial  was scheduled  for September  23, 1993.   On\r\n\nSeptember 22, 1993, the district court accepted a guilty plea\r\n\nfrom  Grajales.  On September  23, a jury  was empaneled (but\r\n\nnot sworn) in Rodriguez's case and trial  was set to begin on\r\n\nSeptember 30, 1993.  On that day, before the jury was  sworn,\r\n\nRodriguez  disputed   the   adequacy  of   the   government s\r\n\ndisclosures concerning  the  background of  its  key  witness\r\n\nTeixeira, the DEA informant.   Rodriguez demanded that  he be\r\n\nprovided  with additional  information.  The  district court,\r\n\naccommodating  Rodriguez s position,  dismissed the  jury and\r\n\nadjourned  the  trial  pending resolution  of  the  discovery\r\n\nissue.\r\n\n          Some  two  weeks   later,  on  October  19,   1993,\r\n\nRodriguez's trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw from the\r\n\ncase.   The motion was  granted after hearing,  and the court\r\n\nallowed Rodriguez time to  obtain new counsel.  In  November,\r\n\nRodriguez's  newly  retained  counsel Barry  Wilson  filed an\r\n\nappearance and, later, a motion for admission pro hac vice in\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe  District  of Rhode  Island.    This proved  problematic.\r\n\nBased on a contempt order that had been issued against Wilson\r\n\nin an  unrelated matter before Judge  Pettine, the government\r\n\nopposed the pro  hac vice motion.  A hearing  was not held on\r                                     \r\n\nthe motion until February 22, 1994.  The motion was allowed.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          That same  day Rodriguez filed a  motion to dismiss\r\n\nthe indictment on  grounds that  he had not  been brought  to\r\n\ntrial within 70 days as required by the STA.  That motion was\r\n\nlater denied in a bench ruling.\r\n\n          Trial commenced on May  12, 1994.  At the  close of\r\n\nthe government's case, the district court granted Rodriguez's\r\n\nmotion for judgment of  acquittal with respect to Count  2 of\r\n\nthe  indictment,  which  charged  conspiracy   to  distribute\r\n\ncocaine.  At the  conclusion of the five-day trial,  the jury\r\n\nreturned  a   guilty  verdict  on  Count   1  (conspiracy  to\r\n\ndistribute heroin)  but  acquitted  Rodriguez  on  all  other\r\n\ncounts (distribution of heroin; distribution of cocaine).\r\n\n          At sentencing,  after concluding  that both  a two-\r\n\nlevel leadership role enhancement and an additional two-level\r\n\ndrug-purity  upward departure  were  warranted, the  district\r\n\ncourt imposed  a sentence  of 121  months imprisonment to  be\r\n\nfollowed  by 5 years  supervised release,  and a  $50 special\r\n\nassessment.\r\n\n                 II.  Speedy Trial Act Claim\r                                                        \r\n\n          Rodriguez's STA claim  raises questions of  whether\r\n\ncertain time consumed in connection with pretrial motions and\r\n\njury  empanelment   is  excludable  from  the  requisite  STA\r\n\ncalculations.       Factual   findings   underlying   a   STA\r\n\ndetermination  are  reviewed  for clear  error,  while  legal\r\n\nrulings are reviewed de novo.  See United States v. Storm, 36\r                                                                     \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nF.3d 1289, 1292  (5th Cir.  1994), cert. denied,  115 S.  Ct.\r                                                           \r\n\n1798  (1995); United States  v. Henderson, 746  F.2d 619, 622\r                                                     \r\n\n(9th Cir. 1984), aff'd, 476 U.S. 321 (1986).\r                                  \r\n\n          The STA  requires that a defendant  be tried within\r\n\n70  days of the filing  of the indictment  or the defendant's\r\n\nfirst appearance before a  judicial officer, whichever occurs\r\n\nlater.  See  Henderson v.  United States, 476  U.S. 321,  322\r                                                    \r\n\n(1986).  The remedy for  violation of the 70-day  requirement\r\n\nis  dismissal  of  the  indictment  either  with  or  without\r\n\nprejudice,  depending on  consideration of  several statutory\r\n\nfactors.    See  18  U.S.C.   3162(a)(2);  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nRamirez, 973 F.2d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 1992).  Not every day that\r                   \r\n\npasses between  indictment or appearance and  trial, however,\r\n\ncounts toward  the 70-day limit.   The Act  itself enumerates\r\n\nvarious  circumstances that  can suspend  the running  of the\r\n\ntime.   See 18 U.S.C.    3161(h).  The  question presented is\r                       \r\n\nwhether  the  total  amount  of  non-excludable  time between\r\n\nindictment  or  judicial appearance  and  the  filing of  the\r\n\npretrial  motion suggesting  a  STA  violation  exceeded  the\r\n\nstatutory limit of 70 days.\r\n\n          The metaphor  of a running  clock is often  used in\r\n\nSTA cases.   The metaphorical clock  here started running  on\r\n\nJune  4, 1993, the day  after the indictment,  and stopped on\r\n\nFebruary  22, 1994, the day Rodriguez  filed his speedy trial\r\n\nmotion,  which  was not  renewed  before trial.    See United\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nStates  v.  Connor, 926  F.2d 81,  84  (1st Cir.  1991) (\"[A]\r                              \r\n\nmotion  for dismissal [under  the STA] is  effective only for\r\n\nperiods  of time  which antedate  the filing  of the  motion.\r\n\nSubsequent   periods  of   delay,   whether   includable   or\r\n\nexcludable, are inconsequential.\").\r\n\n          There  is no  dispute  that three  days devoted  to\r\n\nmiscellaneous    proceedings    concerning   Rodriguez    are\r\n\nexcludable.*   The  battle lines  are thus  drawn around  the\r\n\nremaining  period of 260 days, and the question is whether at\r\n\nleast 190 of those days were excludable.  The answer is yes.\r\n\n          Much   of  Rodriguez's   attack  focuses   on  time\r\n\nassociated with pretrial  motions.  The ground  rules are set\r\n\nby  the  statute  and  Supreme  Court  case  law.     Section\r\n\n3161(h)(1) of the Speedy Trial Act provides for the exclusion\r\n\nof any\r\n\n              (F)      delay  resulting   from  any\r\n          pretrial motion,  from the filing  of the\r\n          motion  through  the  conclusion  of  the\r\n          hearing on, or  other prompt  disposition\r\n          of, such motion; [and]\r\n                    . . .\r\n              (J)  delay reasonably attributable to\r\n          any  period, not  to exceed  thirty days,\r\n          during  which  any proceeding  concerning\r\n          the    defendant   is    actually   under\r\n          advisement by the court.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(1)(F), (J).\r\n\n                \r                            \r\n\n*The parties agree  that the  following days are  excludable under  18\r\nU.S.C.   3161(h)(1): the day  of arraignment (June 14, 1993),  the day\r\non  which Rodriguez's  co-defendant Grajales  submitted a  guilty plea\r\n(September  22,  1993);  and the  day  on  which  the first  jury  was\r\nempaneled (September 23, 1993).\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          There   are   significant   differences    in   the\r\n\nexcludability  of  delays  attributable  to  motions afforded\r\n\nhearings and those decided without hearing.  Such differences\r\n\nresult from  the interplay  between subsections (F)  and (J).\r\n\nIn  Henderson v.  United  States, 476  U.S.  321 (1986),  the\r                                            \r\n\nSupreme  Court held  that  under subsection  (F), the  entire\r                                                                         \r\n\nperiod  beginning from the filing of a pretrial motion to the\r\n\nconclusion of the hearing on that motion  is excludable time.\r\n\nSee id. at 328-31; see also United States v.

Once the hearing on  the motion is\r\n\nconcluded, subsection  (J) limits  the  amount of  excludable\r\n\ntime while the motion is \"under advisement\" to 30  days.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nHenderson, 476 U.S.  at 328-329; United  States v.

Cir. 1987).\r\n\n          When  there is no hearing, a motion is deemed to be\r\n\ntaken  under  advisement when  \"the  court  receives all  the\r\n\npapers it reasonably expects . . . .\"  Henderson, 476 U.S. at\r                                                            \r\n\n329; see also United States v.

Thus, for  a motion  that does  not receive  a\r\n\nhearing, subsections (F) and (J) in conjunction allow for the\r\n\nexclusion of all of the time from the filing of the motion to\r\n\nthe  time that  the  court receives  all reasonably  expected\r\n\npapers, plus no more than an additional 30 days of advisement\r\n\ntime.

For purposes\r                                    \r\nof this appeal,  we assume the motion was filed  on December 10, 1993,\r\nthe  date indicated  on the  district court  docket sheet.    It bears\r\ncomment, however, that more than 45  days passed between the time that\r\nthe district court granted the motion of Rodriguez's former counsel to\r\nwithdraw  from the case  and the filing  of the pro  hac vice motion  \r                                                                     \r\neven  though the court had  expressly ordered Rodriguez  to obtain new\r\ncounsel  within 10  days  of the  withdrawal.   Although  new  counsel\r\npurported to file an \"appearance\" on November 4, 1993, that appearance\r\nwas plainly in  violation of the  district court's  local rules.   See\r                                                                              \r\nD.R.I. Loc. R. 5(c)  (permitting appearance of non-member of  bar only\r\non  admission pro  hac  vice).   Conceivably,  either the  November  4\r                                    \r\n\"appearance\" by Wilson or  the December 1 appearance by  local counsel\r\non behalf of Wilson could be treated functionally as the date on which\r\nthe pro hac vice motion  was filed.  In any case, there is substantial\r                        \r\nreason  to doubt whether the STA clock  was running during the 35 days\r\nthat  Rodriguez,  in  violation  of  the  court's  order,  delayed  in\r\nretaining appropriate counsel of record.  For purposes of this appeal,\r\nhowever, we put that issue to one side.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nSimilarly, the bail motion  filed on October 13,  1993 (which\r\n\ndid not receive a hearing nor, apparently, an express ruling)\r\n\nresulted  in at  least an  additional 30  days of  excludable\r\n\ntime.  See Ortiz, 23 F.3d at 27 n.6 (pretrial motion to which\r                            \r\n\nno opposition was  filed, which did not  receive hearing, and\r\n\nwas never ruled upon  created at least 30 days  of excludable\r\n\ntime);  see also Johnson, 29  F.3d at 945  (same).  Excluding\r                                    \r\n\nthe  delays attributable  to  these motions  reduces the  STA\r\n\ncount to 155 days.\r\n\n          The events  that unfolded in  late September,  1993\r\n\nfurther reduce the count.  On September 23, 1993, Rodriguez's\r\n\ncase  was called to trial, and  a jury was empaneled, but not\r\n\nsworn.   One week later, as  the trial was about  to begin in\r\n\nearnest, a  last-minute discovery  wrangle caused  the still-\r\n\nunsworn jury to be  dismissed and the trial to  be postponed.\r\n\nThe  issue is how to  treat the one-week  interim between the\r\n\njury's empanelment and its unexpected dismissal.\r\n\n          It  is settled that trial generally \"commences\" for\r\n\nSpeedy Trial Act purposes  on the day the jury  is empaneled,\r\n\neven  if  not sworn.

Here, as  far as the\r\n\nrecord reflects,  the parties  and the  court expected  as of\r\n\nSeptember  23 that, following a brief recess of one week, the\r\n\nempaneled jury would be sworn  and that opening arguments and\r\n\ntestimony would get underway on September 30.   Arguably, the\r\n\nSeptember 23, 1993  jury empanelment ended the running of STA\r\n\ntime.  Cf.  Duberry,  923 F.2d at 320 (\"The Speedy  Trial Act\r                               \r\n\ndoes not  require that  once a  trial  commences it  continue\r\n\nwithout  interruption  . . . .\").   Before  September  30 the\r\n\nparties  and the court had  every reason to  believe that the\r\n\nSTA  clock  had ceased  ticking on  September  23.   In these\r\n\ncircumstances, we conclude that, at a minimum, the STA  clock\r\n\ndid  not run  during  the 6-day  interim  between the  jury's\r\n\nempanelment and its dismissal.   Subtracting this time brings\r\n\nthe STA tally to 149 days.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          We  turn next  to the  proceedings of  September 30\r\n\nthat unexpectedly  halted the  trial.  That  day, before  the\r\n\njury was  sworn, Rodriguez's counsel  raised discovery issues\r\n\nwith  the  trial  judge,  contending  that  the  government's\r\n\ndisclosure   of  information   concerning  its   key  witness\r\n\n(Teixeira) had been sorely  inadequate.  Rodriguez asked that\r\n\nthe  court   order  the  government  to   produce  additional\r\n\ninformation.  The district  court, apparently seeing merit in\r\n\nRodriguez's  claim, decided  to  dismiss the  jury.   Defense\r\n\ncounsel then asked  the district  court, \"Judge,  will it  be\r\n\nnecessary  to file a more detailed request . . .?\"  The court\r\n\nreplied,  \"Well, you  take the  time you  need and  study the\r\n\nproblem, then  let me know what you need, all right?\"  Twelve\r\n\ndays later,  on October 12,  1993, Rodriguez filed  a \"Motion\r\n\nfor Exculpatory Evidence\" concerning Teixeira.\r\n\n          Rodriguez's request for  additional information  at\r\n\nthe  September 30, 1993  proceedings was  an oral  motion for\r\n\nsupplemental  discovery,  which  triggered  the  exclusionary\r\n\nprovisions of   3161(h)(1)(F).

Either way, the\r\n\nentire 13-day period from  September 30, 1993 through October\r\n\n12, 1993 is excludable time.  In light of this conclusion, we\r\n\nneed not  address whether the adjournment  resulting from the\r\n\nSeptember 30 proceedings  would be excludable as  an \"ends of\r\n\njustice\"  continuance under the STA.   Had the district court\r\n\nso intended, however, it would have been preferable for it to\r\n\nhave  made an express finding  on the record,  as directed by\r\n\nthe statute,  explaining why the  \"ends of justice  served by\r\n\nthe  granting  of  such  continuance  outweigh[ed]  the  best\r\n\ninterests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\"\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(8)(A); see United States v.

Determining how  much  excludable time  to\r\n\nattribute to this  motion presents a  novel question in  this\r\n\nCircuit: how to treat a delay when the government defaults on\r\n\nits obligation to respond to a defendant's motion by a court-\r\n\nordered deadline.  Rodriguez's  motion was filed on  June 16,\r\n\n1993 and did  not receive  a hearing.   The magistrate  judge\r\n\noverseeing   the  pretrial   proceedings   had  ordered   the\r\n\ngovernment to file  any opposition  by July 23,  1993.   Yet,\r\n\ninexplicably, the government's opposition was not filed until\r\n\nSeptember  2, 1993.  The government has not disputed that its\r\n\nopposition was untimely;  nor has it  pointed to anything  in\r\n\nthe record  that  would justify  the  delay.   Still,  citing\r\n\nHenderson, the  government contends that all of the time from\r                                                        \r\n\nthe  filing of the June 16, 1993  motion to the filing of its\r\n\nuntimely response on September 2, 1993, plus an additional 30\r                                                        \r\n\ndays of  advisement time,  should be deemed  excludable under\r\n\n  3161(h)(1)(F) and (J).  Rodriguez disagrees, asserting that\r\n\n                \r                            \r\n\n***Because the period of  excludable time attributable to the\r\nOctober 12,  1993 written  motion wholly overlaps  the period\r\nindependently excluded by virtue of the October 13, 1993 bail\r\nmotion,  the October 12 motion  does not result  in any extra\r\nexcludable time, except for the single day of October 12.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nthe excludable time should be limited to the period from June\r\n\n16  to July 23 (the date on which the government's opposition\r\n\nwas due), plus an additional 30 days of advisement time after\r                   \r\n\nthat due date.\r\n\n          There   are   considerable   reasons    to   credit\r\n\nRodriguez's  position.   The  government's  broad reading  of\r\n\nHenderson is hardly sensitive to the purposes of the STA.  To\r                     \r\n\nbe sure, Henderson creates an expansive rule of exclusion for\r                              \r\n\ndelays attributable  to the hearing of pretrial motions.  But\r\n\nwe  doubt that Henderson or the Speedy Trial Act itself would\r                                    \r\n\npermit  treating  as   excludable  time  an   extended  delay\r\n\nattributable solely  to the government's unexcused failure to\r\n\ncomply with  a court-ordered briefing schedule.   The dangers\r\n\nof  potential  abuse lurking  behind  such  a broad  rule  of\r\n\nexclusion are plain.\r\n\n          A   more  sensible  rule   might  provide  for  the\r\n\ntermination of excludable time under   3161(h)(1)(F) upon the\r\n\ndue date of the  opposition to a defendant's pretrial  motion\r                    \r\n\nthat does  not receive  a hearing, absent  circumstances that\r\n\nwould  reasonably justify a late filing.  The Seventh Circuit\r\n\nadheres to just such a \"due date\" rule.

Thus, as  of the due date  in the\r                  \r\n\nSeventh  Circuit,   3161(h)(1)(F) ceases to create excludable\r\n\ntime  for a motion that  receives no hearing,  and the 30-day\r\n\nperiod of excludable  \"advisement\" time under   3161(h)(1)(J)\r\n\nbegins; after that 30-day period, the STA clock begins to run\r\n\nagain.  See id.\r                           \r\n\n          The  Thomas  rule  is commended  by  fairly obvious\r                                 \r\n\nconsiderations  of policy.  See Thomas, 788 F.2d at 1259 (\"If\r                                                  \r\n\nthe entire  period [of  delay attributable to  a government's\r\n\nlate  filing]  were  excluded,  a   prosecutor  could  obtain\r\n\nindefinite  exclusions  of  time  by  the  expedient  of  not\r\n\nresponding  to  . . .  motions.    That  would  undercut  the\r\n\nstructure of the Speedy  Trial Act.\").  For several  reasons,\r\n\nhowever, we leave for another day whether to adopt the Thomas\r                                                                         \r\n\n\"due date\"  rule  as the  law  of this  Circuit.   First  and\r\n\nforemost, we  need not  decide definitively whether  to adopt\r\n\n                \r                            \r\n\n****The Fifth  Circuit appears to differ.   See United States\r                                                                         \r\nv.  Martinez-Mercado, 888  F.2d  1484, 1493  (5th Cir.  1989)\r                                \r\n(rejecting appellant's  contention that Speedy Trial Act does\r\nnot exclude  time between  due date of  government's response\r\nunder local  rules  and  actual  filing date).    The  Second\r\nCircuit has left  the question  open.  See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\nAdeniji, 31 F.3d 58, 66 (2d Cir. 1994).\r                   \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nthe  \"due date\" rule in this case, because even applying that\r\n\nrule, the  number of non-excludable days  within the relevant\r\n\nSTA period is less than 70: between the filing of the June 16\r\n\nmotion and  the due date of the  opposition (July 23) fell 38\r\n\ndays  excludable under    3161(h)(1)(F).   Adding 30  days of\r\n\nexcludable    \"under    advisement\"    time    pursuant    to\r\n\n  3161(h)(1)(J),  the total  excludable time  attributable to\r\n\nthe June  16 motion  under the  \"due date\"  rule would be  68\r\n\ndays.  Subtracting this  time from the STA tally  reduces the\r\n\ncount to 68 days, under the 70-day limit.  Second, the record\r\n\nbefore us  is unclear as  to whether  there were in  fact any\r\n\nreasons for the government's  late filing.  Third, it  is not\r\n\nevident that  Rodriguez ever brought the  untimeliness of the\r\n\ngovernment's  opposition to  the district  court's attention.\r\n\nCf.  United States v. Welborn, 849 F.2d 980, 986-87 (5th Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1988) (expressing  concern  that the  Seventh Circuit's  \"due\r\n\ndate\" rule might \"permit a defendant to remain silent after a\r\n\ndeadline imposed  on the prosecution had elapsed and permit a\r\n\nSpeedy Trial Act  violation to accrue  without notice to  the\r\n\nprosecution or the court\").\r\n\n          Finally, we  reject Rodriguez's assertion  that his\r\n\nJune 16 motion did not generate any excludable time from June\r\n\n16  to July 13.   His argument  purports to be  built upon 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    3161(c)(2), which  some  courts have  understood to\r\n\nprohibit  commencement of a trial sooner than 30 days after a\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\ndefendant's  arraignment  or indictment.   See,  e.g., United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Daly, 716 F.2d 1499, 1504-05 (9th Cir. 1983), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndismissed,  465  U.S. 1075  (1984).    From this  reading  of\r                     \r\n\n  3161(c)(2), Rodriguez argues that  his trial could not have\r\n\ncommenced  before July 14, 1993  and that his  June 16 motion\r\n\ntherefore could  not have produced  any actual \"delay\"    and\r\n\nhence no excludable time   before that date.  Whether or  not\r\n\nRodriguez's   suggested   construction  of     3161(c)(2)  is\r\n\ncorrect, his argument is  unavailing.  The argument rests  on\r\n\nthe premise that a  motion which causes no actual  delay of a\r\n\ntrial date  does not  trigger   3161(h)(1).   However, it  is\r\n\nclear in this  Circuit as  in others that  the exclusions  of\r\n\n  3161(h)(1)(F) and  (J) are  \"automatic,\" and do  not depend\r\n\nupon any showing of actual delay.

Excluding these 195  days from our\r\n\nstarting count of 263 leaves only 68 nonexcludable days.\r\n\n          We  need go no further.

Evidentiary Issues\r                                                       \r\n\nA.  Admissibility of Audiotape\r                                          \r\n\n          Teixeira,  the  government's testifying  informant,\r\n\ntaped his meetings with Rodriguez using a concealed recording\r\n\ndevice.  A total  of eight tapes were admitted  into evidence\r\n\nat  trial.   Rodriguez  contends  that  the district  court's\r\n\nadmission  of  one  of  these  tapes  (Gov.  Exhibit  7)  was\r                              \r\n\nreversible  error, for  three  reasons: (1)  the tape,  which\r\n\npurported to be a recording of a meeting between Teixeira and\r\n\nRodriguez  on   February   19,   1993,   was   not   properly\r\n\nauthenticated; (2)  the tape  contains hearsay statements  by\r\n\nTeixeira;  and  (3) the  tape contains  some words  spoken in\r\n\nSpanish, creating a danger of jury confusion.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n          There was  no abuse of discretion  in admitting the\r\n\ntape over  Rodriguez's  authenticity objection.   See  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Font-Ramirez,  944 F.2d 42, 46-47  (1st Cir. 1991),\r                                  \r\n\ncert. denied, 502 U.S. 1065 (1992).  First,          Teixeira\r                        \r\n\nidentified it as the  tape he recorded during a  meeting with\r\n\nRodriguez on February 19, 1993, and Teixeira stated  that the\r\n\ntape fairly and accurately  reflected that meeting.  Teixeira\r\n\nfurther  testified  that  he  had listened  to  the  tape and\r\n\nverified  that his  own voice  was on  it.   Other government\r\n\nwitnesses confirmed  that Teixeira met with  defendant on the\r\n\nrelevant date, that Teixeira was wired to record the relevant\r\n\nmeeting, that Teixeira gave the  tape to the DEA surveillance\r\n\nteam following the meeting, and that the tape passed  through\r\n\na  clean chain of custody preceding trial.  Cf. United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Rengifo, 789 F.2d  975, 978 (1st Cir. 1986)  (holding that\r                      \r\n\ntape  can be  properly  authenticated by  someone other  than\r\n\nparticipant in the recorded conversation).  Rodriguez offered\r\n\nno  evidence that the tape was somehow inaccurate or had been\r\n\naltered.  See United  States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 24 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1986).\r\n\n          Rodriguez's  other objections  to admission  of the\r\n\ntape also fail.  His hearsay objection falters because he did\r\n\nnot make  it at  trial, arguing  only a  foundation objection\r\n\nthere.  Admission of the tape was not plain error.  His final\r\n\nclaim,  that the presence of  some Spanish words  on the tape\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\ncreated a danger that some of the jurors might  have tried to\r\n\nact as  interpreters for  other jurors, is  sheer speculation\r\n\nand provides no basis for reversal.\r\n\n          Any   alleged  error  in  admitting  the  tape  was\r\n\nharmless in any event.   The jury acquitted defendant  of all\r                                                       \r\n\ncounts except for the count charging conspiracy to distribute\r\n\nheroin.   There  was  a  wealth  of  evidence  to  support  a\r\n\nconviction  on that  count that  had nothing  to do  with the\r\n\ndisputed  tape,  including  Teixeira's  live  testimony,  the\r\n\ntestimony of  other surveilling officers,  and several  other\r                                                                         \r\n\ntape  recorded conversations  between Teixeira  and Rodriguez\r\n\nwhose admissibility are not challenged here.\r\n\nB.  Limitation of Impeachment Evidence\r                                                  \r\n\n          During  cross-examination  of  Teixeira  at  trial,\r\n\nRodriguez's  counsel exposed the fact that in January, 1993  \r\n\nshortly  before  the  start  of the  operation  that  led  to\r\n\ndefendant's arrest   Teixeira  had been convicted of perjury.\r\n\nAs Rodriguez s counsel  explored this skeleton in  Teixeira s\r\n\ncloset,  there  arose  some  question  about  precisely  when\r\n\nTeixeira had served the 90-day home confinement sentence that\r\n\nhad attached to his conviction.   Teixeira testified that  he\r\n\nhad already served his sentence as of the date of Rodriguez's\r\n\ntrial  (May  1994),  but  could not  remember  exactly  when.\r\n\nRodriguez,  in presenting  his  own  case, called  Teixeira's\r\n\nprobation officer to the stand.  His testimony suggested that\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nTeixeira had not in fact served his home confinement sentence\r\n\nby May 1994.   Seeking further to impeach  Teixeira s already\r\n\ndamaged credibility,  Rodriguez then moved  for production of\r\n\ncertain   correspondence  in  the  possession  of  Teixeira's\r\n\nprobation officer that might  indicate exactly when  Teixeira\r\n\nhad served his 90-day sentence.  The court denied Rodriguez's\r\n\nrequest for the probation documents.\r\n\n          The district court's decision not  to let Rodriguez\r\n\npursue the  collateral question  of when Teixeira  had served\r\n\nhis perjury sentence is unassailable.   The court had already\r\n\npermitted  Rodriguez ample  opportunity to  impeach Teixeira,\r\n\nand it  is unlikely that  the probation documents  would have\r\n\nadded  anything to  the jury s  ability to  assess Teixeira s\r\n\ntruthfulness.   The  district court  has broad  discretion to\r\n\nlimit the extent to which a defendant is permitted to impeach\r\n\na witness, see  United States  v. Fortes, 619  F.2d 108,  118\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1980), and there  was no abuse  of that discretion\r\n\nhere.  See United  States v. Tejada,  886 F.2d 483, 488  (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1989).\r\n\n                    IV.  Sentencing Issues\r                                                      \r\n\n          The  district court added a two-level adjustment to\r\n\nRodriguez's  base  offense level  in view  of  his role  as a\r\n\nmanager,   supervisor,  or   leader  of   criminal  activity.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c).   This  enhancement resulted in  a total\r\n\noffense level of 28, which  yielded (given a criminal history\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ncategory  of  I),  a  guidelines sentencing  range  of  78-97\r\n\nmonths.  The court  then departed upward from that  range (by\r\n\nthe equivalent  of two  offense levels) pursuant  to U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2D1.1, comment. (n.9) and    5K2.0, in consideration of the\r\n\nunusually high  purity of the  drugs that defendant  had been\r\n\ndealing.    Consequently, the  court  imposed  a sentence  of\r\n\nimprisonment of 121 months.\r\n\n          Rodriguez's  claim  that  there   was  insufficient\r\n\nevidence  to support  a finding  that he played  a leadership\r\n\nrole for  purposes of  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c) is  without merit.\r\n\nThe district court s finding, made with the benefit of all of\r\n\nits observations at trial, is entitled to, and is given here,\r\n\nconsiderable  deference.   See United  States v.  Andujar, 49\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.  1994).  We see no basis  for declaring\r\n\nthat finding to be clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          Rodriguez s  next complaint,  that  he  received  a\r\n\nsubstantially   heavier   sentence   than  his   co-defendant\r\n\nGrajales, is  also without  merit.  Absent  misapplication of\r\n\nthe  Guidelines,  the mere  fact of  the  disparity is  of no\r\n\nconsequence.   See  United States  v.  Wogan, 938  F.2d 1446,\r                                                        \r\n\n1448-49  (1st  Cir.),  cert.  denied, 502  U.S.  969  (1991).\r                                                \r\n\nBesides,  the  difference is  easily  explained.   Rodriguez,\r\n\nunlike  Grajales  (who  pleaded  guilty  before   trial)  was\r\n\nsentenced against  the backdrop of  a full trial  record that\r\n\nexposed in sharp  focus the complete  extent of his  criminal\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nbehavior.   Cf. United States v.  Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1148, 1160-61 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 809 (1991).\r                                                  \r\n\n          Rodriguez s  final complaint  is that  his sentence\r\n\nwas twice enhanced  for the  same or similar  aspects of  his\r\n\ncriminal conduct through the  simultaneous imposition of  the\r\n\nleadership-role  enhancement  and   the  drug-purity   upward\r\n\ndeparture.  Rodriguez  focuses this double-counting  argument\r\n\non  application note 9  to U.S.S.G.    2D1.1,  which explains\r\n\nthat a  drug's high purity  \"is probative of  the defendant's\r\n\nrole  or position  in  the chain  of distribution.\"  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2D1.1,  comment.

From  this language,  Rodriguez\r\n\nargues  that an  upward  departure based  on  drug purity  is\r\n\nduplicative of a leadership role enhancement.\r\n\n          In this case however,  the district court's finding\r\n\nof  leadership role  did  not depend  upon an  inference from\r\n\nheroin  purity.    Rather,  the  court  found  directly  that\r\n\nRodriguez \"used his mules and lackeys to  make deliveries for\r\n\nhim  and [that]  he  exercised leadership  in  some of  these\r\n\ndeliveries by using underlings.\"   Thus, the  leadership-role\r\n\nenhancement was notdriven by any consideration ofdrug purity.\r\n\n          Furthermore, application  note 9 does not  say that\r\n\ndrug purity  and a  defendant's leadership role  are mutually\r\n\nexclusive  sentencing considerations.   The  application note\r\n\nspecifically   states   that  \"[t]rafficking   in  controlled\r\n\nsubstances  . . . of  unusually  high purity  may warrant  an\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nupward departure,\" U.S.S.G.   2D1.1, comment. (n.9) (emphasis\r                            \r\n\nadded),  not that  high purity  can provide  a basis  for the\r\n\nleadership   role  adjustment   set   forth  in     3B1.1(c).\r\n\nMoreover, the notion  of \"leadership role\"  in   3B1.1(c)  is\r\n\nneither conceptually nor factually  equivalent to the  notion\r\n\nof  \"role or position in the  chain of distribution\" referred\r\n\nto  in   2D1.1 application  note 9.   This court has  in fact\r\n\npreviously  affirmed   a   similar  combination   of   upward\r\n\nadjustments.   See United States v.

Rodriguez  also  appeals  his  sentence,\r\n\ncontending that  the district court engaged  in impermissible\r\n\n\"double counting\" when it departed upward based on the purity\r\n\nof the  heroin he was  convicted of conspiring  to distribute\r\n\nwhile   simultaneously   enhancing  his   sentence   for  his\r\n\nleadership role.  The conviction and sentence are affirmed.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          Geraldo  \"Jose\"  Rodriguez  and   his  co-defendant\r\n\nJuvenal  Grajales arranged the sale of a total of 97.65 grams\r\n\nof very pure heroin  (87% to 96% pure) to  a DEA confidential\r\n\ninformant named Miguel Teixeira on four occasions in February\r\n\nand April,  1993.   Teixeira recorded his  conversations with\r\n\nRodriguez  about the  particulars of  these drug  deals at  a\r\n\nnumber of  pre-arranged meetings.   At some of  the meetings,\r\n\nRodriguez was accompanied by Grajales or other associates; at\r\n\nothers,   Rodriguez  sent   associates  to  assist   with  or\r\n\nconsummate the transactions.\r\n\n          Rodriguez and Grajales  were arrested and  indicted\r\n\nfor  distribution of  heroin,  distribution  of cocaine,  and\r\n\nconspiracy  to  possess heroin  and  cocaine  with intent  to\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ndistribute.   Following a period of  pretrial motion practice\r\n\nand  discovery (set forth  in the Appendix  that follows this\r\n\nopinion), trial  was scheduled  for September  23, 1993.   On\r\n\nSeptember 22, 1993, the district court accepted a guilty plea\r\n\nfrom  Grajales.  On September  23, a jury  was empaneled (but\r\n\nnot sworn) in Rodriguez's case and trial  was set to begin on\r\n\nSeptember 30, 1993.  On that day, before the jury was  sworn,\r\n\nRodriguez  disputed   the   adequacy  of   the   government s\r\n\ndisclosures concerning  the  background of  its  key  witness\r\n\nTeixeira, the DEA informant.   Rodriguez demanded that  he be\r\n\nprovided  with additional  information.  The  district court,\r\n\naccommodating  Rodriguez s position,  dismissed the  jury and\r\n\nadjourned  the  trial  pending resolution  of  the  discovery\r\n\nissue.\r\n\n          Some  two  weeks   later,  on  October  19,   1993,\r\n\nRodriguez's trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw from the\r\n\ncase.   The motion was  granted after hearing,  and the court\r\n\nallowed Rodriguez time to  obtain new counsel.  In  November,\r\n\nRodriguez's  newly  retained  counsel Barry  Wilson  filed an\r\n\nappearance and, later, a motion for admission pro hac vice in\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe  District  of Rhode  Island.    This proved  problematic.\r\n\nBased on a contempt order that had been issued against Wilson\r\n\nin an  unrelated matter before Judge  Pettine, the government\r\n\nopposed the pro  hac vice motion.  A hearing  was not held on\r                                     \r\n\nthe motion until February 22, 1994.  The motion was allowed.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          That same  day Rodriguez filed a  motion to dismiss\r\n\nthe indictment on  grounds that  he had not  been brought  to\r\n\ntrial within 70 days as required by the STA.  That motion was\r\n\nlater denied in a bench ruling.\r\n\n          Trial commenced on May  12, 1994.  At the  close of\r\n\nthe government's case, the district court granted Rodriguez's\r\n\nmotion for judgment of  acquittal with respect to Count  2 of\r\n\nthe  indictment,  which  charged  conspiracy   to  distribute\r\n\ncocaine.  At the  conclusion of the five-day trial,  the jury\r\n\nreturned  a   guilty  verdict  on  Count   1  (conspiracy  to\r\n\ndistribute heroin)  but  acquitted  Rodriguez  on  all  other\r\n\ncounts (distribution of heroin; distribution of cocaine).\r\n\n          At sentencing,  after concluding  that both  a two-\r\n\nlevel leadership role enhancement and an additional two-level\r\n\ndrug-purity  upward departure  were  warranted, the  district\r\n\ncourt imposed  a sentence  of 121  months imprisonment to  be\r\n\nfollowed  by 5 years  supervised release,  and a  $50 special\r\n\nassessment.\r\n\n                 II.

The remedy for  violation of the 70-day  requirement\r\n\nis  dismissal  of  the  indictment  either  with  or  without\r\n\nprejudice,  depending on  consideration of  several statutory\r\n\nfactors.    See  18  U.S.C.   3162(a)(2);  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nRamirez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589647\"><a href=\"/opinion/589647/united-states-v-domingo-ramirez-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 (1st Cir. 1992).  Not every day that\r                   \r\n\npasses between  indictment or appearance and  trial, however,\r\n\ncounts toward  the 70-day limit.   The Act  itself enumerates\r\n\nvarious  circumstances that  can suspend  the running  of the\r\n\ntime.   See 18 U.S.C.    3161(h).  The  question presented is\r                       \r\n\nwhether  the  total  amount  of  non-excludable  time between\r\n\nindictment  or  judicial appearance  and  the  filing of  the\r\n\npretrial  motion suggesting  a  STA  violation  exceeded  the\r\n\nstatutory limit of 70 days.\r\n\n          The metaphor  of a running  clock is often  used in\r\n\nSTA cases.   The metaphorical clock  here started running  on\r\n\nJune  4, 1993, the day  after the indictment,  and stopped on\r\n\nFebruary  22, 1994, the day Rodriguez  filed his speedy trial\r\n\nmotion,  which  was not  renewed  before trial.

It bears\r\ncomment, however, that more than 45  days passed between the time that\r\nthe district court granted the motion of Rodriguez's former counsel to\r\nwithdraw  from the case  and the filing  of the pro  hac vice motion  \r                                                                     \r\neven  though the court had  expressly ordered Rodriguez  to obtain new\r\ncounsel  within 10  days  of the  withdrawal.   Although  new  counsel\r\npurported to file an \"appearance\" on November 4, 1993, that appearance\r\nwas plainly in  violation of the  district court's  local rules.   See\r                                                                              \r\nD.R.I. Loc. R. 5(c)  (permitting appearance of non-member of  bar only\r\non  admission pro  hac  vice).   Conceivably,  either the  November  4\r                                    \r\n\"appearance\" by Wilson or  the December 1 appearance by  local counsel\r\non behalf of Wilson could be treated functionally as the date on which\r\nthe pro hac vice motion  was filed.  In any case, there is substantial\r                        \r\nreason  to doubt whether the STA clock  was running during the 35 days\r\nthat  Rodriguez,  in  violation  of  the  court's  order,  delayed  in\r\nretaining appropriate counsel of record.

Rodriguez asked that\r\n\nthe  court   order  the  government  to   produce  additional\r\n\ninformation.  The district  court, apparently seeing merit in\r\n\nRodriguez's  claim, decided  to  dismiss the  jury.   Defense\r\n\ncounsel then asked  the district  court, \"Judge,  will it  be\r\n\nnecessary  to file a more detailed request . . .?\"  The court\r\n\nreplied,  \"Well, you  take the  time you  need and  study the\r\n\nproblem, then  let me know what you need, all right?\"  Twelve\r\n\ndays later,  on October 12,  1993, Rodriguez filed  a \"Motion\r\n\nfor Exculpatory Evidence\" concerning Teixeira.\r\n\n          Rodriguez's request for  additional information  at\r\n\nthe  September 30, 1993  proceedings was  an oral  motion for\r\n\nsupplemental  discovery,  which  triggered  the  exclusionary\r\n\nprovisions of   3161(h)(1)(F).

Determining how  much  excludable time  to\r\n\nattribute to this  motion presents a  novel question in  this\r\n\nCircuit: how to treat a delay when the government defaults on\r\n\nits obligation to respond to a defendant's motion by a court-\r\n\nordered deadline.  Rodriguez's  motion was filed on  June 16,\r\n\n1993 and did  not receive  a hearing.   The magistrate  judge\r\n\noverseeing   the  pretrial   proceedings   had  ordered   the\r\n\ngovernment to file  any opposition  by July 23,  1993.   Yet,\r\n\ninexplicably, the government's opposition was not filed until\r\n\nSeptember  2, 1993.  The government has not disputed that its\r\n\nopposition was untimely;  nor has it  pointed to anything  in\r\n\nthe record  that  would justify  the  delay.   Still,  citing\r\n\nHenderson, the  government contends that all of the time from\r                                                        \r\n\nthe  filing of the June 16, 1993  motion to the filing of its\r\n\nuntimely response on September 2, 1993, plus an additional 30\r                                                        \r\n\ndays of  advisement time,  should be deemed  excludable under\r\n\n  3161(h)(1)(F) and (J).  Rodriguez disagrees, asserting that\r\n\n                \r                            \r\n\n***Because the period of  excludable time attributable to the\r\nOctober 12,  1993 written  motion wholly overlaps  the period\r\nindependently excluded by virtue of the October 13, 1993 bail\r\nmotion,  the October 12 motion  does not result  in any extra\r\nexcludable time, except for the single day of October 12.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nthe excludable time should be limited to the period from June\r\n\n16  to July 23 (the date on which the government's opposition\r\n\nwas due), plus an additional 30 days of advisement time after\r                   \r\n\nthat due date.\r\n\n          There   are   considerable   reasons    to   credit\r\n\nRodriguez's  position.   The  government's  broad reading  of\r\n\nHenderson is hardly sensitive to the purposes of the STA.  To\r                     \r\n\nbe sure, Henderson creates an expansive rule of exclusion for\r                              \r\n\ndelays attributable  to the hearing of pretrial motions.  But\r\n\nwe  doubt that Henderson or the Speedy Trial Act itself would\r                                    \r\n\npermit  treating  as   excludable  time  an   extended  delay\r\n\nattributable solely  to the government's unexcused failure to\r\n\ncomply with  a court-ordered briefing schedule.   The dangers\r\n\nof  potential  abuse lurking  behind  such  a broad  rule  of\r\n\nexclusion are plain.\r\n\n          A   more  sensible  rule   might  provide  for  the\r\n\ntermination of excludable time under   3161(h)(1)(F) upon the\r\n\ndue date of the  opposition to a defendant's pretrial  motion\r                    \r\n\nthat does  not receive  a hearing, absent  circumstances that\r\n\nwould  reasonably justify a late filing.  The Seventh Circuit\r\n\nadheres to just such a \"due date\" rule.

Subtracting this  time from the STA tally  reduces the\r\n\ncount to 68 days, under the 70-day limit.  Second, the record\r\n\nbefore us  is unclear as  to whether  there were in  fact any\r\n\nreasons for the government's  late filing.

From this  reading  of\r                     \r\n\n  3161(c)(2), Rodriguez argues that  his trial could not have\r\n\ncommenced  before July 14, 1993  and that his  June 16 motion\r\n\ntherefore could  not have produced  any actual \"delay\"    and\r\n\nhence no excludable time   before that date.  Whether or  not\r\n\nRodriguez's   suggested   construction  of     3161(c)(2)  is\r\n\ncorrect, his argument is  unavailing.  The argument rests  on\r\n\nthe premise that a  motion which causes no actual  delay of a\r\n\ntrial date  does not  trigger   3161(h)(1).

His hearsay objection falters because he did\r\n\nnot make  it at  trial, arguing  only a  foundation objection\r\n\nthere.  Admission of the tape was not plain error.  His final\r\n\nclaim,  that the presence of  some Spanish words  on the tape\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\ncreated a danger that some of the jurors might  have tried to\r\n\nact as  interpreters for  other jurors, is  sheer speculation\r\n\nand provides no basis for reversal.\r\n\n          Any   alleged  error  in  admitting  the  tape  was\r\n\nharmless in any event.   The jury acquitted defendant  of all\r                                                       \r\n\ncounts except for the count charging conspiracy to distribute\r\n\nheroin.   There  was  a  wealth  of  evidence  to  support  a\r\n\nconviction  on that  count that  had nothing  to do  with the\r\n\ndisputed  tape,  including  Teixeira's  live  testimony,  the\r\n\ntestimony of  other surveilling officers,  and several  other\r                                                                         \r\n\ntape  recorded conversations  between Teixeira  and Rodriguez\r\n\nwhose admissibility are not challenged here.\r\n\nB.  Limitation of Impeachment Evidence\r                                                  \r\n\n          During  cross-examination  of  Teixeira  at  trial,\r\n\nRodriguez's  counsel exposed the fact that in January, 1993  \r\n\nshortly  before  the  start  of the  operation  that  led  to\r\n\ndefendant's arrest   Teixeira  had been convicted of perjury.\r\n\nAs Rodriguez s counsel  explored this skeleton in  Teixeira s\r\n\ncloset,  there  arose  some  question  about  precisely  when\r\n\nTeixeira had served the 90-day home confinement sentence that\r\n\nhad attached to his conviction.   Teixeira testified that  he\r\n\nhad already served his sentence as of the date of Rodriguez's\r\n\ntrial  (May  1994),  but  could not  remember  exactly  when.\r\n\nRodriguez,  in presenting  his  own  case, called  Teixeira's\r\n\nprobation officer to the stand.  His testimony suggested that\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nTeixeira had not in fact served his home confinement sentence\r\n\nby May 1994.   Seeking further to impeach  Teixeira s already\r\n\ndamaged credibility,  Rodriguez then moved  for production of\r\n\ncertain   correspondence  in  the  possession  of  Teixeira's\r\n\nprobation officer that might  indicate exactly when  Teixeira\r\n\nhad served his 90-day sentence.  The court denied Rodriguez's\r\n\nrequest for the probation documents.\r\n\n          The district court's decision not  to let Rodriguez\r\n\npursue the  collateral question  of when Teixeira  had served\r\n\nhis perjury sentence is unassailable.   The court had already\r\n\npermitted  Rodriguez ample  opportunity to  impeach Teixeira,\r\n\nand it  is unlikely that  the probation documents  would have\r\n\nadded  anything to  the jury s  ability to  assess Teixeira s\r\n\ntruthfulness.

This  enhancement resulted in  a total\r\n\noffense level of 28, which  yielded (given a criminal history\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ncategory  of  I),  a  guidelines sentencing  range  of  78-97\r\n\nmonths.  The court  then departed upward from that  range (by\r\n\nthe equivalent  of two  offense levels) pursuant  to U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2D1.1, comment. (n.9) and    5K2.0, in consideration of the\r\n\nunusually high  purity of the  drugs that defendant  had been\r\n\ndealing.    Consequently, the  court  imposed  a sentence  of\r\n\nimprisonment of 121 months.\r\n\n          Rodriguez's  claim  that  there   was  insufficient\r\n\nevidence  to support  a finding  that he played  a leadership\r\n\nrole for  purposes of  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c) is  without merit.\r\n\nThe district court s finding, made with the benefit of all of\r\n\nits observations at trial, is entitled to, and is given here,\r\n\nconsiderable  deference.   See United  States v.  Andujar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span>\r                                                                     \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1st Cir.  1994).

Absent  misapplication of\r\n\nthe  Guidelines,  the mere  fact of  the  disparity is  of no\r\n\nconsequence.   See  United States  v.

Rodriguez  focuses this double-counting  argument\r\n\non  application note 9  to U.S.S.G.    2D1.1,  which explains\r\n\nthat a  drug's high purity  \"is probative of  the defendant's\r\n\nrole  or position  in  the chain  of distribution.\"  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2D1.1,  comment.  (n. 9).   From  this language,  Rodriguez\r\n\nargues  that an  upward  departure based  on  drug purity  is\r\n\nduplicative of a leadership role enhancement.\r\n\n          In this case however,  the district court's finding\r\n\nof  leadership role  did  not depend  upon an  inference from\r\n\nheroin  purity.    Rather,  the  court  found  directly  that\r\n\nRodriguez \"used his mules and lackeys to  make deliveries for\r\n\nhim  and [that]  he  exercised leadership  in  some of  these\r\n\ndeliveries by using underlings.\"   Thus, the  leadership-role\r\n\nenhancement was notdriven by any consideration ofdrug purity.\r\n\n          Furthermore, application  note 9 does not  say that\r\n\ndrug purity  and a  defendant's leadership role  are mutually\r\n\nexclusive  sentencing considerations.   The  application note\r\n\nspecifically   states   that  \"[t]rafficking   in  controlled\r\n\nsubstances  . . . of  unusually  high purity  may warrant  an\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nupward departure,\" U.S.S.G.   2D1.1, comment. (n.9) (emphasis\r                            \r\n\nadded),  not that  high purity  can provide  a basis  for the\r\n\nleadership   role  adjustment   set   forth  in     3B1.1(c).\r\n\nMoreover, the notion  of \"leadership role\"  in   3B1.1(c)  is\r\n\nneither conceptually nor factually  equivalent to the  notion\r\n\nof  \"role or position in the  chain of distribution\" referred\r\n\nto  in   2D1.1 application  note 9.
