The government has  moved for summary\n                    \n\naffirmance of the district court's order revoking defendant's\n\nsupervised release.  \n\n          Defendant  pleaded guilty to a charge of possession\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine,  in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n   841(a)(1).   He was  initially sentenced  to 57  months in\n\ncustody followed by three years of supervised release.   H e\n\nconceded at the revocation hearing  that he had violated  the\n\nconditions  of his  supervised release.   The  district court\n\nresentenced  him to  15 months  imprisonment, followed  by 21\n\nmonths of supervised release.  \n\n         On appeal  defendant raises a single issue, \"whether\n\nthe supervised  release revocation  [\"SRR\"] provisions  of 18\n\nU.S.C.   3583(e)(3), permit a district court, upon revocation\n\nof  a  term  of  supervised  release,  to  impose a  sentence\n\ncombining incarceration  with  a further  term of  supervised\n\nrelease.\" \n\n          This court recently  considered the identical issue\n\nin United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292 (1st Cir.  1993).  We\n                          \n\nheld in O'Neil,  \n              \n\n     [T]he SRR provision . . . permits a district court,\n     upon revocation of a term of supervised release, to\n     impose  a  prison sentence  combining incarceration\n     with a further term  of supervised release, so long\n     as  (1) the incarcerative  portion of  the sentence\n     does not exceed the time limit specified in the SRR\n     provision itself,  and (2) the  combined length  of\n     the new  prison sentence cum supervision  term does\n                                 \n     not  exceed the  duration of  the original  term of\n     supervised release.\n\n                             -2-\n\nO'Neil, 11 F.3d at 302.\n      \n\n          Defendant  concedes that the  sentence imposed upon\n\nhim comports  with O'Neil.   He argues, however,  that O'Neil\n                                                             \n\nwas wrongly decided.  \n\n          We  decline  defendant's   invitation  to   revisit\n\nO'Neil, especially as all  of defendant's arguments, and most\n      \n\nof the authorities he cites, were aired and considered by the\n\npanel that heard O'Neil.   In this circuit, newly-constituted\n                       \n\npanels are generally bound by prior panel decisions on point.\n\nBroderick v. Roache, 996 F.2d 1294, 1298 (1st Cir. 1993).   \n                   \n\n          Defendant's reliance on the Supreme  Court's recent\n\ndecision  in United  States v.  Granderson, 114  S. Ct.  1259\n                                          \n\n(1994),  is  misplaced.    Granderson  and  O'Neil  addressed\n                                                  \n\ndifferent  substantive  and  interpretive   issues  involving\n\ndiscrete  statutory sections  with different  texts, designs,\n\nand histories.  The  differences which defendant perceives in\n\nthe two opinions, including their differing uses of the \"rule\n\nof lenity,\" are a function of the lack of common issues,  not\n\nof differences in analytic method or statutory construction. \n\n          As  the  dispositive  issue   on  appeal  has  been\n\nrecently  and  authoritatively decided  by  a  panel of  this\n\ncourt, and  no other  substantial question is  presented, the\n\ndecision below is summarily affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n                                          \n\n                             -3-\n",
