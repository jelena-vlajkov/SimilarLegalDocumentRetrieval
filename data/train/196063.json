Instead,  he\n\ndisputed  the  Magistrate   Judge's  implicit  finding   that\n\nMiller's deprivation  of property was based  upon \"random and\n\nunauthorized\"   conduct.     Miller  claimed   that   he  was\n\n\"challenging  the Sheriff's Department ordinances and customs\n\nallowing disposal of property without notice or a hearing, or\n\nany procedures as to  how to reclaim said property.\"   Miller\n\nfailed, however,  to  identify the  specific \"ordinances  and\n\ncustoms\"  to  which  he  referred.     Nor  do  the   factual\n\nallegations in Miller's complaint  support his claim that the\n\nconduct was not \"random and unauthorized.\"  G i v e n   t h e\n\nMagistrate  Judge's Recommended Decision  notifying Miller of\n\nthe  deficiencies  of his  due  process  claim, and  Miller's\n\nfailure to correct those inadequacies, the district court did\n\nnot abuse  its discretion in dismissing  Miller's due process\n\nclaim pursuant to   1915(d).   See Purvis v.

These  facts, if proved,  could state  a\n\nvalid  Fourth  Amendment  claim.   The  allegation  that  the\n\nwarrant was issued by a Justice of  the Peace does not render\n\nMiller's  legal theory  baseless.   \"Judicial  approval of  a\n\nwarrant  cannot  serve  as an  absolute  bar  to  the    1983\n\nliability of the officer who obtained the warrant.\" Briggs v.\r                                                                      \n\nMalley,  748 F.2d 715, 721  (1st Cir. 1984),  aff'd, 475 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n335 (1986).\n\n          Since the district court failed to address Miller's\n\nFourth Amendment claim, and since that claim is not meritless\n\non its face, we  vacate that portion of the  dismissal order.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nWe remand the  case for  the filing of  a redacted  complaint\n\nlimited  to  the  Fourth  Amendment  claim,  for  service  of\n\nprocess,  and   for  further  proceedings   not  inconsistent\n\nherewith.\n\n          Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.\r                                                                     \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

These facts, if proved, could state a valid Fourth Amendment claim.  The allegation that the warrant was issued by a Justice of the Peace does not render Miller's legal theory baseless.  \"Judicial approval of a warrant cannot serve as an absolute bar to the Sec. 1983 liability of the officer who obtained the warrant.\"  Briggs v.
