Bath Iron  Works, Inc. (\"Bath\")\r                                       \n\nis  a Maine corporation that has long engaged in shipbuilding\n\nand the repair of ships.  It has employees who are covered by\n\nthe Longshore and Harbor  Workers Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.\n\n    901-50 (the  \"Longshore Act\").   That  statute enacts  an\n\nextensive   workers'   compensation  program   that  protects\n\nlongshore  and  other  specific   classes  of  workers  whose\n\ninjuries occur upon navigable waters of the  United States or\n\nadjoining facilities like piers and dry docks.  Id.   903(a).\r                                                               \n\n     For  the  most part,  scheduled  payments  for death  or\n\ndisability are made either by the employer or under insurance\n\ncoverage;  Bath, as  it  happens,  is  a self-insurer.    But\n\nCongress has also  included in the Longshore  Act a so-called\n\n\"special  fund,\"  33  U.S.C.      944,  administered  by  the\n\nSecretary of Labor (\"the  Secretary\").  The fund is  used for\n\nvarious  purposes--most importantly,  for \"second  injury\" or\n\n\"section 8(f)\"  payments made  under 33  U.S.C.    908(f),  a\n\nprovision  described below.   See  33 U.S.C.    944(i).   The\r                                             \n\nspecial fund is primarily funded by annual assessments levied\n\nby the Secretary  on employers subject to  the Longshore Act.\n\nId.   944(c).1  \r               \n\n                    \r                                \n\n     1The  statute refers  to  contributions by  self-insured\nemployers  or  carriers;  but  for  simplicity  we  refer  to\r                         \n\"employers\" throughout the opinion.\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     In this case the Secretary brought  suit against Bath in\n\nthe  district court to  recover supplemental  assessments for\n\nthe special fund claimed to be due by the Secretary.  Because\n\nthe dispute  involves Bath's obligation to  the special fund,\n\nthe statutory  formula used to determine such obligations--33\n\nU.S.C.     944(c)(2)--needs  to  be explained.    First,  the\n\nstatute  requires  the  Secretary   to  estimate  the  fund's\n\nexpected  obligations  for  the  forthcoming  year, including\n\nexpected  section 8(f)  payments.   Id.  Then,  the Secretary\r                                                   \n\nestimates  other fund  income  (e.g., fines)  and levies  the\r                                                \n\nbalance  by  assessing employers.    Id.   Specifically,  the\r                                                    \n\nSecretary fixes  and assesses  each employer's share  under a\n\nformula that  takes the  average  of two  fractions, both  of\n\nwhich use the prior year's experience as a base.  Id.\r                                                                 \n\n     One fraction  is the ratio of  the individual employer's\n\nworkers'  compensation payments  \"under  this  chapter\"  [the\n\nLongshore  Act] during the prior year to all such payments by\n\nall  employers under the chapter during that year.  33 U.S.C.\n\n   944(c)(2)(A).   The  other fraction  is  the ratio  of the\n\nsection 8(f) payments attributable to the employer during the\n\nprior year to all such  section 8(f) payments attributable to\n\nall employers for that year.   Id.   944(c)(2)(B).  In brief,\r                                              \n\nthe employer's obligation is  based in part on its  own prior\n\npayment  experience  and  in   part  on  the  special  fund's\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nexperience in making section 8(f) payments to that employer's\n\nemployees.\n\n     For example,  if Bath's compensation  payments under the\n\nLongshore Act for 1988 represented three percent of all  such\n\nemployer payments for that year, and the special section 8(f)\n\npayments for  Bath employees  represented one percent  of all\n\nsuch section  8(f) payments for that  year, Bath's assessment\n\nwould be two percent of the (otherwise unfunded) special fund\n\nobligations for 1989, as  estimated by the Secretary.   Under\n\nsuch  a formula, every employer has an interest in seeing its\n\nown  workers'  compensation  payments  \"under  this  chapter\"\n\nrepresented by as small a figure as possible.   The lower the\n\nfigure,  the more the burden of financing the special fund is\n\nshifted to other employers.\n\n     The present  case arose because Bath  calculated its own\n\nassessment  by excluding from  the formula  calculation under\n\nsection  944(c)(2)(A)  most  payments  it  made  to   injured\n\nemployees  who were covered both by the Longshore Act and the\n\nMaine Workers Compensation Act.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39,\n\n   1 et seq.  The Maine statute generally provides comparable\r                       \n\npayments,  and both  regimes encourage  the employer  to make\n\npayment  without having  the  employee file  a formal  claim.\n\nWhere  both statutes  covered  the same  injury  in the  same\n\namount,  Bath said that it was making payment under the Maine\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nstatute and filed a boilerplate denial of liability under the\n\nLongshore Act.  See 33 U.S.C.   914(d).\r                               \n\n     An employer's  payment of workers'  compensation under a\n\nstate statute discharges  the employer's liability  pro tanto\r                                                                         \n\nunder  the Longshore  Act.   This was  well settled  by court\n\ndecision long ago and eventually Congress enacted a provision\n\nto  this effect.   33 U.S.C.    903(e).   Thus,  in such dual\n\nliability cases, Bath's payments--purportedly under the Maine\n\nstatute--erased  its liability under  the federal  statute as\n\nwell.  This erasure of federal  obligations led the Secretary\n\nto recalculate Bath's formula  assessment on the premise that\n\nsuch dual liability  payments should be treated  as ones made\n\n\"under\" the Longshore  Act.  Bath  disagreed.  The  Secretary\n\nbrought suit.\n\n     In the  district court,  the magistrate judge  entered a\n\nrecommended decision in favor of Bath, and the district court\n\napproved  the recommendation  and  dismissed the  Secretary's\n\ncomplaint.  The  gist of  the district  court's decision  was\n\nthat the language of the formula--specifically, its reference\n\nto  an employer's  payments  made  \"under this  chapter\"--was\n\nclear and unambiguous.  \"The subsection [944(c)(2)(A)],\" said\n\nthe  district  court,  \"speaks  in  terms  of  payments,  not\n\nliability\";  and it  deemed  the dual  liability payments  in\n\ndispute  to be ones made  under Maine law,  not the Longshore\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nAct.    The  court  also relied  secondarily  on  legislative\n\nhistory and policy.\n\n     On this  appeal, the  Secretary takes the  position that\n\nhis  own  reading  of  the  formula  language  is  at   least\n\npermissible,  is a  reasonable one,  and is  entitled to  the\n\ndeference ordinarily  due to  the agency or  department under\n\nthe  Chevron doctrine.  Chevron v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984).\r                                                   \n\nWe  generally agree  with  the Secretary  that the  statutory\n\nlanguage permits  his reading, which is entitled to a measure\n\nof  deference.   We  also  think  that  the  history  of  the\n\nprovision supports the  Secretary's reading.   Finally, there\n\nis no clue anywhere that the distinction proposed by Bath was\n\never considered, let alone adopted, by Congress.\n\n     Starting with  statutory  language, the  parties  devote\n\nmany pages to the question whether the disputed payments are,\n\nin a  literal sense  or by various  characteristics, payments\n\n\"under\" the Longshore  Act.  We  do not  think that the  bare\n\nwords \"under  this chapter\" are precise enough to resolve our\n\ncase.   As a matter  of dictionary meaning,  the phrase could\n\n(as  Bath claims) refer to  the statute invoked  by the payor\n\nwhen making the payment--here, the Maine statute--or it could\n\n(as the Secretary  claims) cover any  payment that erases  or\n\ndischarges  a  liability  that  otherwise  exists  under  the\n\nfederal  statute,  regardless of  what  the  payor says  when\n\nhanding over the money.\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     The  surrounding  circumstances   seem  to  us   equally\n\nuninformative.  It  makes no difference to any  known purpose\n\nof Congress, or any  suggested policy underlying the statute,\n\nthat  Bath  did,  as  it claims,  file  repeated  boilerplate\n\nnotices of  contravention denying liability under the federal\n\nstatute.   Conversely,  it  does not  matter whether,  as the\n\nSecretary claims, Bath reported  the accidents in question to\n\nfederal authorities,  as other provisions required  it to do.\n\nThese arguments are examples of fussing about inessentials.\n\n     What matters, given that  the statute's language is open\n\nto more than  one reading, is the history and  purpose of the\n\nprovision.    Congress adopted  an  earlier  version of  this\n\nformula in 1972 when the assessment device was first  adopted\n\nto  support the special fund.  Under the 1972 amendments, the\n\nassessment  was based  on  the proportion  of the  employer's\n\nprior  year \"payments made on  risks covered by  this Act\" to\n\n\"the total of such payments made by all\" employers.  86 Stat.\n\n1251, 1256.  This is a variation, of course, on the  language\n\nnow  comprising  the first  half  of  the statutory  formula.\n\nCompare 33 U.S.C.   944(c)(2)(A).\r                   \n\n     In  recent years, the main  use of the  special fund has\n\nbeen to encourage employers to hire workers who have suffered\n\na  previous  partial  permanent  disability.     For  various\n\nreasons,  employers feared that such a  worker who suffered a\n\nnew disability  might impose extra liability  on the employer\r               \n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nwhere the first  injury contributed  to the  severity of  the\n\nsecond; a  good example is  the loss  of an eye  by a  worker\n\nalready blind  in one eye.   See  Lawson v. Suwannee  Fruit &amp;\r                                                                         \n\nSteamship Co., 336  U.S. 198 (1949);  2 A. Larson,  Workmen's\r                                                                         \n\nCompensation Law   59.31(a) (1994).   The section 8(f) regime\r                            \n\nwas designed to lessen this discouragement.\n\n     For some  years, section 8(f) has  accomplished this end\n\nby making the special  fund, and not the employer,  liable in\n\ncertain    circumstances   for    so-called   \"second-injury\"\n\ncompensation payments, beginning after 104 weeks of  employer\n\npayments.  33 U.S.C.   908(f).   In 1972, when Congress first\n\nadopted the employer assessment device to support the special\n\nfund,  it also  greatly  enlarged  the  scope of  the  fund's\n\nliability  by  inter  alia  extending  the  fund's  liability\r                                      \n\nretroactively  to  provide  some  coverage  for  some  second\n\ninjuries  that  had  occurred  prior  to  the  new  statutory\n\namendments.\n\n     What Congress  discovered between 1972 and  1984 is that\n\nemployers were \"dumping\"  as many  cases as  possible in  the\n\nsection 8(f) basket.   This meant that the employer  not only\n\navoided compensation liability to  the worker after 104 weeks\n\n(as intended) but also (unexpectedly)  lowered the employer's\n\nfuture formula payments  to the special fund  below the level\n\nthat  would otherwise  have applied.   The  lowering occurred\n\nbecause the  original 1972  formula only counted  payments by\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nthe employer as  increasing the employer's fraction;  section\n\n8(f)  payments made by the fund, on account of the employer's\n\ndouble-injury  employees,  did  not increase  the  employer's\n\nassessment.\n\n     Under the new section  944(c)(2) formula adopted in 1984\n\nand in force  today, the payments by  the fund on account  of\n\nthese  double-injury  employees  is  now  attributed  to  the\n\nemployer  to  the  extent  that such  payments  increase  the\n\nemployer's assessment  under the second half  of the formula.\n\nThis  second  half represents  only 50  percent of  the final\n\nassessment;  thus the employer  gets some help  when the fund\n\ntakes over compensation and, presumably, the employer retains\n\nsome incentive to hire the partly disabled.  But the employer\n\ndoes see its future assessments rise somewhat as the employer\n\ntransfers responsibility to the special fund.\n\n     As Congress saw it, \"[t]his [new] formula will, at once,\n\ndissuade  the dumping of cases  into the fund,  and will more\n\nequitably  apportion  the responsibility  of  paying for  the\n\nfund.\"\n\n130  Cong. Rec.  25,904  (1984) (statement  of Mr.  Miller).2\n\nFurther, because  the employer  now has a  continuing (albeit\n\nindirect) interest in  holding down  unjustified payments  to\n\n                    \r                                \n\n     2The  statutory solution ultimately  devised by Congress\nwas adopted late in  the day by the Conference  Committee and\nexplained  only in floor statements.

Rec.\n\n26,297 (1984) (statement of Senator Nickles). \n\n     In sum, prior to 1984 Congress intended the special fund\n\nto  be paid for by employers primarily in proportion to their\n\nexperience in paying compensation  claims required to be paid\n\nby the  federal statute (\"payments  made on risks  covered by\n\n[the] Act\").  No reason is suggested to us why Congress might\n\nhave  wished in 1984 to lower an employer's share because, by\n\nhappenstance,  the  employer  was  located in  a  state  with\n\ngenerous compensation laws of its own and the employer  chose\n\nto  pin a  state label  on its  payment while  discharging an\n\nobligation that existed under both federal and state law.  By\n\nthe  same  token,  no  legislative  evidence  indicates  that\n\nCongress intended to make such a change in 1984.\n\n     Bath  infers such  an  intent because  Congress in  1984\n\naltered the 1972  phrase \"payments made  on risks covered  by\n\n[the] Act\" to refer instead to payments \"under this chapter.\"\n\nAs best we can tell, Congress happened by chance to alter the\n\nwording of the original  1972 sentence when--in a last-minute\n\ncompromise (see note 2, supra)--it adopted the 1972 provision\r                                         \n\nas the first part of the new two-part formula.  To the extent\n\nthat the  1972  language  is slightly  more  helpful  to  the\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nSecretary,  it strengthens  the Secretary's  present position\n\nslightly, rather  than  detracts from  it, precisely  because\n\nthere  is no  indication that  Congress meant  to change  the\n\nsubstance of that part of the formula.\n\n     There is only  one discrepancy that gives  us any pause.\n\nIn  1991, the  Secretary's Benefits  Review Board  rendered a\n\ndecision in a case entitled Stewart v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,\r                                                                        \n\n25 B.R.B.S. 151  (1991).   There, it appears  that a  second-\n\ninjury  employee of  Bath withdrew  a claim  for compensation\n\nunder  the Longshore  Act when  Maine's benefits  proved more\n\ngenerous.    Although the  Stewart  opinion  is difficult  to\r                                              \n\ndecipher without  more information, the Board apparently took\n\nthe view that section  8(f) relief from the special  fund was\n\nnot  available to  Bath because  the payments  that Bath  was\n\nmaking to the  employee were  required of Bath  by the  Maine\n\nstatute but not by federal law.\n\n     Bath argued to the district court, and repeats here, its\n\nclaim that  \"it would be  anomalous to base  [Bath's] special\n\nfund  assessments on  state law  payments, when  special fund\n\nrelief  is not available to [Bath] from its obligations under\n\nthe  Maine  [compensation  law].\"   The  technical  responses\n\noffered in  the government's reply brief may  explain why the\n\ndistrict court saw some merit  in Bath's reliance on Stewart.\r                                                                        \n\nThe  government's failure  either  to answer  Bath's  central\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nargument, or to concede the discrepancy, is not what we would\n\nexpect from government counsel.\n\n     Bath's  argument  is  relevant   in  the  sense  that  a\n\nconstruction that produces anomalous results is, by that fact\n\nalone,  a  more  doubtful  reading  of  a  statute.    Public\r                                                                         \n\nEmployees Retirement  Sys. of Ohio  v.

Still,  nothing in  Stewart  is  literally\r                                                          \n\ninconsistent with the government's reading  of the assessment\n\nformula; Stewart  turns on a  reading of other  provisions of\r                            \n\nthe Longshore Act  that are  not centrally  involved in  this\n\ncase.  At worst, Stewart--assuming it was correctly decided--\r                                    \n\nproduces  an apparent possible inequity of a kind that is not\n\nunknown  in  complex  statutory arrangements.

It has employees who are covered by\n\nthe Longshore and Harbor  Workers Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.\n\n    901-50 (the  \"Longshore Act\").   That  statute enacts  an\n\nextensive   workers'   compensation  program   that  protects\n\nlongshore  and  other  specific   classes  of  workers  whose\n\ninjuries occur upon navigable waters of the  United States or\n\nadjoining facilities like piers and dry docks.  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>   903(a).\r                                                               \n\n     For </span><pre class=\"inline\"> the  most part,  scheduled  payments  for death  or\n\ndisability are made either by the employer or under insurance\n\ncoverage;  Bath, as  it  happens,  is  a self-insurer.

The fund is  used for\n\nvarious  purposes--most importantly,  for \"second  injury\" or\n\n\"section 8(f)\"  payments made  under 33  U.S.C.    908(f),  a\n\nprovision  described below.

Because\n\nthe dispute  involves Bath's obligation to  the special fund,\n\nthe statutory  formula used to determine such obligations--33\n\nU.S.C.     944(c)(2)--needs  to  be explained.    First,  the\n\nstatute  requires  the  Secretary   to  estimate  the  fund's\n\nexpected  obligations  for  the  forthcoming  year, including\n\nexpected  section 8(f)  payments.   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Then,  the </span><pre class=\"inline\">Secretary\r                                                   \n\nestimates  other fund  income  (e.g., fines)  and levies  the\r                                                \n\nbalance  by  assessing employers.    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>   Specifically,  the\r</span><pre class=\"inline\">                                                    \n\nSecretary fixes  and assesses  each employer's share  under a\n\nformula that  takes the  average  of two  fractions, both  of\n\nwhich use the prior year's experience as a base.  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r                                                                 \n\n     One fraction </span><pre class=\"inline\"> is the ratio of  the individual employer's\n\nworkers'  compensation payments  \"under  this  chapter\"  [the\n\nLongshore  Act] during the prior year to all such payments by\n\nall  employers under the chapter during that year.  33 U.S.C.\n\n   944(c)(2)(A).   The  other fraction  is  the ratio  of the\n\nsection 8(f) payments attributable to the employer during the\n\nprior year to all such  section 8(f) payments attributable to\n\nall employers for that year.   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>   944(c)(2)(B).  In </span><pre class=\"inline\">brief,\r                                              \n\nthe employer's obligation is  based in part on its  own prior\n\npayment  experience  and  in   part  on  the  special  fund's\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nexperience in making section 8(f) payments to that employer's\n\nemployees.\n\n     For example,  if Bath's compensation  payments under the\n\nLongshore Act for 1988 represented three percent of all  such\n\nemployer payments for that year, and the special section 8(f)\n\npayments for  Bath employees  represented one percent  of all\n\nsuch section  8(f) payments for that  year, Bath's assessment\n\nwould be two percent of the (otherwise unfunded) special fund\n\nobligations for 1989, as  estimated by the Secretary.   Under\n\nsuch  a formula, every employer has an interest in seeing its\n\nown  workers'  compensation  payments  \"under  this  chapter\"\n\nrepresented by as small a figure as possible.   The lower the\n\nfigure,  the more the burden of financing the special fund is\n\nshifted to other employers.\n\n     The present  case arose because Bath  calculated its own\n\nassessment  by excluding from  the formula  calculation under\n\nsection  944(c)(2)(A)  most  payments  it  made  to   injured\n\nemployees  who were covered both by the Longshore Act and the\n\nMaine Workers Compensation Act.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39,\n\n   1 et seq.  The Maine statute generally provides comparable\r                       \n\npayments,  and both  regimes encourage  the employer  to make\n\npayment  without having  the  employee file  a formal  claim.\n\nWhere  both statutes  covered  the same  injury  in the  same\n\namount,  Bath said that it was making payment under the Maine\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nstatute and filed a boilerplate denial of liability under the\n\nLongshore Act.  See 33 U.S.C.   914(d).\r                               \n\n     An employer's  payment of workers'  compensation under a\n\nstate statute discharges  the employer's liability  pro tanto\r                                                                         \n\nunder  the Longshore  Act.   This was  well settled  by court\n\ndecision long ago and eventually Congress enacted a provision\n\nto  this effect.   33 U.S.C.    903(e).   Thus,  in such dual\n\nliability cases, Bath's payments--purportedly under the Maine\n\nstatute--erased  its liability under  the federal  statute as\n\nwell.  This erasure of federal  obligations led the Secretary\n\nto recalculate Bath's formula  assessment on the premise that\n\nsuch dual liability  payments should be treated  as ones made\n\n\"under\" the Longshore  Act.  Bath  disagreed.  The  Secretary\n\nbrought suit.\n\n     In the  district court,  the magistrate judge  entered a\n\nrecommended decision in favor of Bath, and the district court\n\napproved  the recommendation  and  dismissed the  Secretary's\n\ncomplaint.  The  gist of  the district  court's decision  was\n\nthat the language of the formula--specifically, its reference\n\nto  an employer's  payments  made  \"under this  chapter\"--was\n\nclear and unambiguous.  \"The subsection [944(c)(2)(A)],\" said\n\nthe  district  court,  \"speaks  in  terms  of  payments,  not\n\nliability\";  and it  deemed  the dual  liability payments  in\n\ndispute  to be ones made  under Maine law,  not the Longshore\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nAct.    The  court  also relied  secondarily  on  legislative\n\nhistory and policy.\n\n     On this  appeal, the  Secretary takes the  position that\n\nhis  own  reading  of  the  formula  language  is  at   least\n\npermissible,  is a  reasonable one,  and is  entitled to  the\n\ndeference ordinarily  due to  the agency or  department under\n\nthe  Chevron doctrine.

We  also  think  that  the  history  of  the\n\nprovision supports the  Secretary's reading.   Finally, there\n\nis no clue anywhere that the distinction proposed by Bath was\n\never considered, let alone adopted, by Congress.\n\n     Starting with  statutory  language, the  parties  devote\n\nmany pages to the question whether the disputed payments are,\n\nin a  literal sense  or by various  characteristics, payments\n\n\"under\" the Longshore  Act.  We  do not  think that the  bare\n\nwords \"under  this chapter\" are precise enough to resolve our\n\ncase.   As a matter  of dictionary meaning,  the phrase could\n\n(as  Bath claims) refer to  the statute invoked  by the payor\n\nwhen making the payment--here, the Maine statute--or it could\n\n(as the Secretary  claims) cover any  payment that erases  or\n\ndischarges  a  liability  that  otherwise  exists  under  the\n\nfederal  statute,  regardless of  what  the  payor says  when\n\nhanding over the money.\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     The  surrounding  circumstances   seem  to  us   equally\n\nuninformative.  It  makes no difference to any  known purpose\n\nof Congress, or any  suggested policy underlying the statute,\n\nthat  Bath  did,  as  it claims,  file  repeated  boilerplate\n\nnotices of  contravention denying liability under the federal\n\nstatute.   Conversely,  it  does not  matter whether,  as the\n\nSecretary claims, Bath reported  the accidents in question to\n\nfederal authorities,  as other provisions required  it to do.\n\nThese arguments are examples of fussing about inessentials.\n\n     What matters, given that  the statute's language is open\n\nto more than  one reading, is the history and  purpose of the\n\nprovision.    Congress adopted  an  earlier  version of  this\n\nformula in 1972 when the assessment device was first  adopted\n\nto  support the special fund.  Under the 1972 amendments, the\n\nassessment  was based  on  the proportion  of the  employer's\n\nprior  year \"payments made on  risks covered by  this Act\" to\n\n\"the total of such payments made by all\" employers.  86 Stat.\n\n1251, 1256.  This is a variation, of course, on the  language\n\nnow  comprising  the first  half  of  the statutory  formula.\n\nCompare 33 U.S.C.   944(c)(2)(A).\r                   \n\n     In  recent years, the main  use of the  special fund has\n\nbeen to encourage employers to hire workers who have suffered\n\na  previous  partial  permanent  disability.

Larson,  Workmen's\r                                                                         \n\nCompensation Law   59.31(a) (1994).   The section 8(f) regime\r                            \n\nwas designed to lessen this discouragement.\n\n     For some  years, section 8(f) has  accomplished this end\n\nby making the special  fund, and not the employer,  liable in\n\ncertain    circumstances   for    so-called   \"second-injury\"\n\ncompensation payments, beginning after 104 weeks of  employer\n\npayments.  33 U.S.C.   908(f).   In 1972, when Congress first\n\nadopted the employer assessment device to support the special\n\nfund,  it also  greatly  enlarged  the  scope of  the  fund's\n\nliability  by  inter  alia  extending  the  fund's  liability\r                                      \n\nretroactively  to  provide  some  coverage  for  some  second\n\ninjuries  that  had  occurred  prior  to  the  new  statutory\n\namendments.\n\n     What Congress  discovered between 1972 and  1984 is that\n\nemployers were \"dumping\"  as many  cases as  possible in  the\n\nsection 8(f) basket.   This meant that the employer  not only\n\navoided compensation liability to  the worker after 104 weeks\n\n(as intended) but also (unexpectedly)  lowered the employer's\n\nfuture formula payments  to the special fund  below the level\n\nthat  would otherwise  have applied.   The  lowering occurred\n\nbecause the  original 1972  formula only counted  payments by\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nthe employer as  increasing the employer's fraction;  section\n\n8(f)  payments made by the fund, on account of the employer's\n\ndouble-injury  employees,  did  not increase  the  employer's\n\nassessment.\n\n     Under the new section  944(c)(2) formula adopted in 1984\n\nand in force  today, the payments by  the fund on account  of\n\nthese  double-injury  employees  is  now  attributed  to  the\n\nemployer  to  the  extent  that such  payments  increase  the\n\nemployer's assessment  under the second half  of the formula.\n\nThis  second  half represents  only 50  percent of  the final\n\nassessment;  thus the employer  gets some help  when the fund\n\ntakes over compensation and, presumably, the employer retains\n\nsome incentive to hire the partly disabled.  But the employer\n\ndoes see its future assessments rise somewhat as the employer\n\ntransfers responsibility to the special fund.\n\n     As Congress saw it, \"[t]his [new] formula will, at once,\n\ndissuade  the dumping of cases  into the fund,  and will more\n\nequitably  apportion  the responsibility  of  paying for  the\n\nfund.\"\n\n130  Cong.

Rec.\n\n26,297 (1984) (statement of Senator Nickles). \n\n     In sum, prior to 1984 Congress intended the special fund\n\nto  be paid for by employers primarily in proportion to their\n\nexperience in paying compensation  claims required to be paid\n\nby the  federal statute (\"payments  made on risks  covered by\n\n[the] Act\").  No reason is suggested to us why Congress might\n\nhave  wished in 1984 to lower an employer's share because, by\n\nhappenstance,  the  employer  was  located in  a  state  with\n\ngenerous compensation laws of its own and the employer  chose\n\nto  pin a  state label  on its  payment while  discharging an\n\nobligation that existed under both federal and state law.  By\n\nthe  same  token,  no  legislative  evidence  indicates  that\n\nCongress intended to make such a change in 1984.\n\n     Bath  infers such  an  intent because  Congress in  1984\n\naltered the 1972  phrase \"payments made  on risks covered  by\n\n[the] Act\" to refer instead to payments \"under this chapter.\"\n\nAs best we can tell, Congress happened by chance to alter the\n\nwording of the original  1972 sentence when--in a last-minute\n\ncompromise (see note 2, supra)--it adopted the 1972 provision\r                                         \n\nas the first part of the new two-part formula.  To the extent\n\nthat the  1972  language  is slightly  more  helpful  to  the\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nSecretary,  it strengthens  the Secretary's  present position\n\nslightly, rather  than  detracts from  it, precisely  because\n\nthere  is no  indication that  Congress meant  to change  the\n\nsubstance of that part of the formula.\n\n     There is only  one discrepancy that gives  us any pause.\n\nIn  1991, the  Secretary's Benefits  Review Board  rendered a\n\ndecision in a case entitled Stewart v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,\r                                                                        \n\n25 B.R.B.S. 151  (1991).   There, it appears  that a  second-\n\ninjury  employee of  Bath withdrew  a claim  for compensation\n\nunder  the Longshore  Act when  Maine's benefits  proved more\n\ngenerous.    Although the  Stewart  opinion  is difficult  to\r                                              \n\ndecipher without  more information, the Board apparently took\n\nthe view that section  8(f) relief from the special  fund was\n\nnot  available to  Bath because  the payments  that Bath  was\n\nmaking to the  employee were  required of Bath  by the  Maine\n\nstatute but not by federal law.\n\n     Bath argued to the district court, and repeats here, its\n\nclaim that  \"it would be  anomalous to base  [Bath's] special\n\nfund  assessments on  state law  payments, when  special fund\n\nrelief  is not available to [Bath] from its obligations under\n\nthe  Maine  [compensation  law].\"   The  technical  responses\n\noffered in  the government's reply brief may  explain why the\n\ndistrict court saw some merit  in Bath's reliance on Stewart.\r                                                                        \n\nThe  government's failure  either  to answer  Bath's  central\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nargument, or to concede the discrepancy, is not what we would\n\nexpect from government counsel.\n\n     Bath's  argument  is  relevant   in  the  sense  that  a\n\nconstruction that produces anomalous results is, by that fact\n\nalone,  a  more  doubtful  reading  of  a  statute.
