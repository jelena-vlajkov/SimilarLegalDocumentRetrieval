The circumscribed  role of\n                                   \n\nfederal  courts reviewing  arbitration awards  in labor  contract\n\ndisputes is now well established.  As the  Supreme Court found in\n\nUnited  Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 36-\n                                               \n\n45 (1987), courts must resist the temptation  to substitute their\n\nown  judgment about  the  most  reasonable  meaning  of  a  labor\n\ncontract for that  of the  arbitrator and avoid  the tendency  to\n\nstrike down even an arbitrator's erroneous interpretation of such\n\ncontracts.     Instead,   courts  must   confine  themselves   to\n\ndetermining whether the arbitrator's construction of the contract\n\nwas in any way plausible.\n\n          The issue in this case is whether any plausible reading\n\nof a  collective bargaining  agreement  supports an  arbitrator's\n\nruling   in  a   dispute  over   fringe   benefit  contributions.\n\nPlaintiffs-appellees, J.M.  Cashman, Inc. and R.  Zoppo Co., Inc.\n\n(the  \"plaintiffs\"  or  \"Cashman   and  Zoppo\"),  challenged  the\n\narbitration   order,   which  favored   the  defendant-appellant,\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters,  Chauffeurs, Warehousemen\n\nand Helpers of American, Local 379 (the \"Union\"), in the district\n\ncourt.   The  district court  vacated the  arbitration award  and\n\nremanded  the dispute to the  arbitrator for a  new resolution of\n\nthe  case.   Because  we find  that  the district  court  stepped\n\noutside  of  its  highly  circumscribed  role  of  assessing  the\n\nplausibility of the arbitrator's interpretation  of the agreement\n\nbetween   the   parties,   we   reverse   the  court's   holding.\n\nNevertheless,  we agree  with the  district  court that  the case\n\n                               -2-\n\nshould  be remanded to the arbitrator for resolution of a related\n\nissue of federal law.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          This case arises  out of the  arbitration of a  dispute\n\nbetween the Union and  a group of contractor-employers, including\n\nplaintiffs  Cashman and  Zoppo, involved  in the  construction of\n\nwaste water  treatment facilities  in Boston Harbor  (the \"Boston\n\nHarbor Project\").  On  March 2, 1992, the Union  filed grievances\n\nagainst Cashman, Zoppo, and six other project employers, claiming\n\nthat truck drivers  on the  Boston Harbor Project  who owned  and\n\ndrove  their  own  trucks,  so  called \"owner-operators,\"  should\n\nreceive certain  fringe benefit contributions  that the employers\n\nwere  already paying  on behalf  of other  Boston  Harbor Project\n\nemployees.    The  grievances  asserted that  the  Boston  Harbor\n\nProject  Labor Agreement  (\"Project  Agreement\"),  signed by  the\n\nUnion  and  the employers,  required  that the  same  \"health and\n\nwelfare  contributions  and all  pension  contributions\"  made on\n\nbehalf of  other employees  must also  be made on  behalf of  the\n\nowner-operators.\n\n          The employers  claimed that  they did  not have  to pay\n\nfringe benefits on behalf of owner-operators because the contract\n\ndid not require it  and, more importantly, because the  Union and\n\nmany  of the employers had a long-standing practice of not paying\n\nsuch  owner-operator  benefits  going  back at  least  twenty-six\n\nyears.  According to the employers, this practice was established\n\nafter the Union  and certain employer-contractors on a  number of\n\n                               -3-\n\nstate  construction projects  (not  including  Cashman and  Zoppo\n\nthemselves)  agreed  that, to  the  extent  a nucleus  of  owner-\n\noperator  truck  drivers  would  be  present  on  any  individual\n\nconstruction project, the  employers would not be required to pay\n\nfringe benefits  for the owner-operators.   The employers working\n\non  the  Boston Harbor  Project, who  were  required to  sign the\n\nProject  Agreement in  order to  bid initially  on the  work, see\n                                                                 \n\nBuilding  &amp;  Constr.  Trades  Council v.  Associated  Builders  &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nContractors,  Inc., 113 S. Ct.  1190 (1993), rev'g,  935 F.2d 345\n                                                  \n\n(1st  Cir. 1991)  (en banc), maintained  that they  expected this\n\nestablished  practice  to  continue  as  in   previous  projects.\n\nCashman and Zoppo, however, had never entered into  a contractual\n\nrelationship  with the  Union before  the Boston  Harbor Project.\n\nConsequently, no past practices  had been established between the\n\nUnion and the plaintiffs themselves.\n\n          Pursuant to the Project Agreement, the dispute over the\n\nfringe benefits was brought  before an arbitrator for resolution.\n\nOn January 20, 1993, the  arbitrator found in favor of  the Union\n\nand  ordered the  plaintiffs  and  the  other employers  to  pay,\n\nretroactively, post-grievance benefits  and to pay  future fringe\n\nbenefit  contributions on  behalf  of  the  owner-operator  truck\n\ndrivers.   In his accompanying opinion,  the arbitrator explained\n\nthat  certain provisions  of the  Massachusetts Teamsters'  Heavy\n\nConstruction   Agreement   (\"Teamsters  Agreement\"),   which  was\n\nincorporated into the Project  Agreement, in conjunction with the\n\nProject Agreement itself, explicitly obligated employers to  make\n\n                               -4-\n\nhealth  insurance  and pension  contributions  on  behalf of  the\n\nowner-operators in question.\n\n          At  issue in  this appeal  is the  arbitrator's finding\n\nthat  the past  practice of  not paying  the fringe  benefits for\n\nowner-operators did not bind the parties in this case because the\n\nProject Agreement \"wiped the slate clean\" of such past practices.\n\nThe arbitrator relied on  the following language in  the preamble\n\nof the Project Agreement to support his finding:\n\n            No  practice, understanding  or agreement\n            between  a Contractor  and a  Union party\n            which is not explicitly set forth in this\n            Agreement shall  be binding on  any other\n            party  unless endorsed in  writing by the\n            Project Contractor.\n\nBy  interpreting this language as negating all past practices and\n\nunderstandings  not  explicitly  set  forth  within  the  Project\n\nAgreement,  the  arbitrator disregarded  the  voluminous evidence\n\npresented  by  the  employers  of  the  established  practice  of\n\nexcluding  owner-operators from fringe benefit contributions.  As\n\na result,  the language  of the  Project Agreement granting  such\n\nbenefits was found to be controlling.\n\n          Also at  issue on  appeal is  the  related question  of\n\nwhether   the  owner-operator   truck  drivers   are  independent\n\ncontractors or  employees.  If they  are independent contractors,\n\nSection 302  of the Labor  Management Relations Act  (\"LMRA\"), 29\n\nU.S.C.    186,  would prohibit fringe  benefit payments  on their\n\nbehalf.    The arbitrator  acknowledged  that  the employers  had\n\nargued that fringe benefit payments for the owner-operators would\n\nbe illegal under  Section 302, but he  made no explicit  legal or\n\n                               -5-\n\nfactual findings on the issue in his opinion.  While a  rejection\n\nof  the employers'  contention was  implicit in  the arbitrator's\n\naward favoring  the Union, nothing indicates  that the arbitrator\n\nactually determined whether the owner-operators were employees or\n\nindependent contractors for purposes of the LMRA.\n\n          Following  the entry of the arbitrator's award, Cashman\n\nand Zoppo filed a complaint in the district court on February 19,\n\n1993, requesting that  the court  vacate the award.   On  summary\n\njudgment,  the  district  court  held  that  the  arbitrator  had\n\nimpermissibly exceeded his authority by misapplying the plain and\n\nunambiguous language of the Project Agreement preamble concerning\n\npast  practices, thereby  failing to  duly consider  the evidence\n\nthat the parties had a practice of not paying fringe benefits for\n\nowner-operators.    The  district   court  found  that  the  past\n\npractices provision  of the  preamble -- particularly  the words,\n\n\"no practice . . . shall be binding on any other party\" (emphasis\n                                                      \n\nadded)  --  clearly  and  unambiguously  meant  that  established\n\npractices between parties A and  B are not meant to  bind outside\n\nparty C.  The court found that the phrase could not reasonably be\n\ninterpreted to  mean that  all established practices,  even those\n\nbetween parties A  and B, are completely wiped out by the Project\n\nAgreement.   Consequently, the  court held  that the Union  could\n\nstill  be  bound by  the past  practice  of not  requiring fringe\n\nbenefit contributions for  owner-operators.   The district  court\n\nvacated  the  arbitrator's award  and  remanded the  case  to the\n\narbitrator to  determine the merits,  giving proper consideration\n\n                               -6-\n\nto the evidence of past practices.\n\n          The court  also left  for the  arbitrator the  issue of\n\nwhether,  in light  of  the court's  holding that  past practices\n\ncould   be  considered,   the  owner-operators   are  independent\n\ncontractors,  thus rendering  the  payment of  benefits on  their\n\nbehalf illegal.\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\n\n          A.  Standard Of Review\n                                \n\n          It  is well  established that  federal court  review of\n\nlabor  arbitral  decisions, particularly  on matters  of contract\n\ninterpretation,   is   extremely   narrow  and   \"extraordinarily\n\ndeferential.\"  Dorado Beach Hotel Corp. v. Uni n  de Trabajadores\n                                                                 \n\nde la Industria Gastron mica Local 610, 959 F.2d 2, 3-4 (1st Cir.\n                                      \n\n1992);  see,  e.g.,  Misco,  484 U.S.  at  36-45  (1987); Berklee\n                                                                 \n\nCollege  of Music v.

The  court may not  supplant the  arbitrator's\n\ndetermination of the  merits of  a contract dispute,  even if  it\n\nfinds that determination  to be erroneous.   Rather, the  court's\n\ntask is limited to determining if the arbitrator's interpretation\n\nof the contract is in any way plausible.

The Past Practices Clause\n                                       \n\n          With   this   circumscribed   standard  for   reviewing\n\narbitration awards in  mind, there  is little  question that  the\n\narbitrator's interpretation of the  Project Agreement -- at least\n\n                               -9-\n\nto the extent  that he found that the  past practices clause bars\n\nconsideration of the plaintiffs' evidence of prior fringe benefit\n                               \n\narrangements  -- must  be upheld  as a  plausible reading  of the\n\ncontract.   This  result  is compelled  because the  arbitrator's\n\nholding comports with the  district court's own interpretation of\n\nthe past practices clause  when properly applied to the  facts of\n\nthis case.  Thus,  even if the arbitrator exceeded  his authority\n\nin finding that the  past practices clause wiped the  slate clean\n\nof  all established practices between all parties, an issue we do\n\nnot decide, he certainly  did not exceed his authority  by wiping\n\nthe  slate clean  between the  Union and  the plaintiffs  in this\n\nparticular case.\n\n          The  district court  apparently failed to  consider the\n\npossibility that plaintiffs in this case are  \"other parties\" and\n\ntherefore not  privy to  the past  practice  of excluding  owner-\n\noperators  from the payment of fringe benefits.  According to the\n\ndistrict  court,  the  plain   language  of  the  past  practices\n\nprovision  in the  preamble provides  merely that  past practices\n\nestablished between parties A and B shall not be binding on party\n\nC,  although  they  will  continue  to  be  binding  on  A and  B\n\nthemselves.   Applying  this interpretation  to the  present case\n\nreveals that fringe benefit practices between the Union and other\n\nemployer-contractors (parties  \"A\" and \"B\" respectively)  are not\n\nbinding on the plaintiffs (both party \"C's\"), who did not have an\n\nestablished  past practice with the Union and are thus \"any other\n\nparties\"  under  the past  practices clause.    As a  result, the\n\n                               -10-\n\ncontract  could be  read  to  require  the arbitrator  to  ignore\n\nevidence of  past practices between  the Union and  other parties\n\nwhen applying the provisions of the Project Agreement to disputes\n\nbetween   the  Union  and  the   plaintiffs.    Because  such  an\n\ninterpretation is a plausible one,  we must reverse the  district\n\ncourt's vacation  of the arbitration  ruling with respect  to the\n\narbitrator's construction of the Project Agreement.\n\n          The plaintiffs  take issue with such  an application of\n\nthe past practices clause to the  facts of this case.  They argue\n\nthat because the  Union itself was privy  to the practice  of not\n\nrequiring fringe benefit payments for owner-operators,  the Union\n\ncan still be  held to that practice, regardless  of the fact that\n\nplaintiffs  cannot  in  any way  be  bound  by  such a  practice.\n\nPlaintiffs point to the language of the clause, which states that\n\n\"[n]o practice . . . between a Contractor and a Union party . . .\n\nshall be  binding on any other  party,\" to argue that  the clause\n\nitself concerns only the effects of past practices on new parties\n\nto the project agreement but in  no way limits the effect of past\n\npractices on the Union itself.\n\n          The plaintiffs' interpretation is certainly reasonable,\n\nbut, for  our purposes, it  is also irrelevant.   Our task  is to\n\ndetermine  whether  the  arbitrator  exceeded  his  authority  by\n\nfailing to apply the contract in a plausible manner, not to  seek\n\nout the  most reasonable meaning  of the contract.   Interpreting\n\nthe  past practices  clause to  bar consideration  of plaintiffs'\n\nevidence of past practice in this case is clearly plausible.  The\n\n                               -11-\n\nclause  can be  read to preclude  application of  all established\n\npast practices to \"any  other party,\" even if that practice is in\n\nthe  \"other party's\" favor.   Such  a reading  stems from  one of\n\nseveral plausible  constructions of  the language in  the clause:\n\n(1) no practice between parties A  and B shall be binding between\n\nparties  A and  C;  (2) practices  not  binding  on party  C  are\n\nlikewise unavailable to C for use against parties A or B (i.e., C\n\nis not  entitled to rely on  or benefit from a  practice which is\n\nnot  binding on  itself); and  (3) no  practice shall  be binding\n\nunlessalreadyestablished betweenaUnion andaparticular contractor.\n\n          In this case, the  arbitrator could plausibly find that\n\nthe practice  of excluding fringe  benefits for  owner-operators,\n\nestablished  between  the Union  and  other  contractors, is  not\n\nbinding between the Union and the plaintiffs.  Alternatively, the\n\narbitrator  could find  that plaintiffs  cannot benefit  from the\n\npast fringe benefit  practice because each  plaintiff is an  \"any\n\nother party\"  and thus could not be bound by the practice were it\n\nbeneficial to the Union instead of to the employer.\n\n          Plaintiffs  protest  that  we  cannot  now  employ such\n\nreasoning to  retroactively  salvage an  otherwise  unsustainable\n\narbitration  award.   They  point out  that  even if  the Union's\n\ninterpretation  of the  past practices  clause is  plausible, the\n\narbitrator  did not  arrive at  that interpretation  himself, but\n\ninstead,  arrived at  an  interpretation that  ignored the  plain\n\nlanguage of the  contract.   The arbitrator found  that the  past\n\npractices clause wiped  the slate clean of all  practices between\n\n                               -12-\n\nall  parties, not  just  practices between  parties  A and  C  as\n\ndiscussed  above.    The  arbitration  award  cannot  be  upheld,\n\nplaintiffs argue,  on  the  basis  of an  interpretation  of  the\n\ncontract  that the arbitrator did not even make, because, in this\n\ncase  at least,  the arbitrator  might have  come to  a different\n\nconclusion  as  to  whether   past  practice  evidence  could  be\n\nconsidered if  he adopted the district  court's interpretation of\n\nthe past practices clause at the time of his decision.\n\n          We  see  no  problem with  upholding  the  arbitrator's\n\ndecision on  grounds or reasoning not employed  by the arbitrator\n\nhimself.  To begin with, an arbitrator  has no obligation to give\n\nhis  or her  reasons for  an  award.   Raytheon Co.  v.

The arbitrator's\n\ninterpretation of the  past practices clause  in the preamble  as\n\nprecluding  the  use of  past  practice  evidence in  determining\n\nplaintiffs'   obligations  under  the   Project  Agreement  is  a\n\nplausible  interpretation of  the contract and  as such,  must be\n                                                              \n\nupheld.

The  fact  that the\n                     \n\narbitrator's  \"wipe-the-slate-clean\"  construction  of  the  past\n\npractices clause might indicate  that the arbitrator exceeded his\n\nauthority  if he had  applied that construction  to other parties\n\nnot  present in this litigation does not  mean that he might have\n\nexceeded  his authority in this particular case.  Rather, we know\n\nthe  arbitrator   did  not  exceed  his   authority  because  his\n\n                               -14-\n\napplication of the past practice clause to the plaintiffs' claims\n\ndrew  its  essence  from  the  collective  bargaining  agreement.\n\nTherefore, we  need not speculate  how the arbitrator  might have\n\nresolved  this  case  had  he  considered  the  district  court's\n\nconstruction of the contract language at issue.\n\n          C.

Given that a determination under    302 could\n\nhave  criminal  consequences, the  plaintiffs deserve  a thorough\n\njudicial review of an arbitrator's decision as to this issue.\n\n          Neither party disputes that the plaintiffs' payment  of\n\nfringe benefits on behalf of the owner-operators is illegal under\n\n  302  if the owner-operators are  independent contractors rather\n\nthan employees.  The parties do disagree, however, on whether the\n\nissue was properly decided by the arbitrator and, if not, how the\n\nissue  should now  be resolved.   The  plaintiffs argue  that the\n\narbitrator did not properly decide the issue and  that we, or the\n\ndistrict  court,   should  find  that   the  owner-operators  are\n\n                               -15-\n\nindependent contractors, effectively  nullifying the  arbitration\n\naward.  The Union argues that the arbitrator correctly found that\n\nthe owner-operators were employees and that we should uphold this\n\nfinding.\n\n          The  arbitrator  did,  at  the  very  least, implicitly\n\ndecide  the    302 issue  by granting  an award  in favor  of the\n\nUnion.    However,  we  are  not satisfied  that  the  arbitrator\n\nconducted  the  appropriate  statutory analysis  for  making  the\n\nrequired  factual determination  of the  owner-operator's status.\n\nDistinguishing  between employees and independent contractors for\n\npurposes  of the LMRA is governed by general principles of agency\n\nlaw.

There is no  reason to believe, as the Union seems\n\nto  suggest, that  the arbitrator's  decision regarding  the past\n\npractices clause, which we uphold in this opinion, is dispositive\n\nnot only of the underlying contractual dispute, but of the    302\n\nissue as well.  Past practices are only one facet of the complete\n\nagency  test  under      302.    Consequently,  the  arbitrator's\n\ndiscussion  of  the  Project Agreement  and  the  import  of past\n\npractices concerning  the owner-operators, while relevant  to the\n\nparties'  intended working relationship and thus to the status of\n\nthe owner-operators  in this  case, is  not itself  sufficient to\n\nconvince  us that  a  complete    302  agency test  analysis  was\n\nundertaken.   We  cannot,  therefore, defer  to the  arbitrator's\n\nimplicit factual finding on the owner-operators' status to uphold\n\nthe arbitration award  until a  more complete    302 analysis  is\n\nconducted.\n\n          We are not prepared,  however, to conduct that analysis\n\nourselves without first giving  the arbitrator the opportunity to\n\nreexamine  the factual  circumstances of  this case.   Plaintiffs\n\n                               -17-\n\nasserted  in  their action  before  the district  court  that the\n\narbitration award  is unenforceable  because it  violates federal\n\nlaw.   The district court  declined to review  this claim because\n\nthe  court vacated  the arbitration  award on  the issue  of past\n\npractices.  Because we now  reverse the district court's  ruling,\n\nwe are left with plaintiffs'   302 allegations, which have yet to\n\nbe properly adjudicated.   In  turn, we are  not disposed  toward\n\nmaking  factual findings in the first instance, given the absence\n\nof  explicit factual  findings  from the  district  court or  the\n\narbitrator, that  are required for a proper  determination of the\n\nowner-operators'  status.    Although  a  largely  uncontradicted\n\nrecord exists in  this case that would allow us  to resolve the  \n\n302 issue if we  needed to, we consider ourselves too far removed\n\nfrom the dispute to properly  weigh the various factors  involved\n\nin this  fact-intensive determination.  In other words, we refuse\n\nto uphold the arbitrator's finding because plaintiffs have raised\n\na claim meriting  federal judicial  review yet we,  as a  federal\n\nappeals court, are  not in  a suitable position  to conduct  that\n\nreview.\n\n          Unfortunately,  the  district  court  is  in  the  same\n\nposition that we are in with respect to determining the status of\n\nowner-operators.   Consequently,  we decline  to remand  the case\n\ndirectly to  the district  court for a  resolution of  the    302\n\nissue.  The district court itself chose to remand the proceedings\n\ninstead of deciding the merits of the case and we think it is the\n\ncourt's prerogative to  do so.   Although federal  courts have  a\n\n                               -18-\n\nduty to  scrutinize such  federal issues with  potential criminal\n\nconsequences,  the  arbitrator  can  play an  important  role  in\n\nproviding  first-hand factual  findings  for the  benefit of  the\n\nreviewing  court.     Therefore,  we  remand  this  case  to  the\n\narbitrator for  a  separate determination  of the  status of  the\n\nowner-operators under   302.\n\n          The plaintiffs  do not dispute our  authority to remand\n\nactions   to  the   arbitrator;   however,  they   claim  it   is\n\ninappropriate to do so when the issue on remand is one of federal\n\nlaw.   We disagree with their contention that it is inappropriate\n\nfor an arbitrator to apply federal statutes.  On the contrary, it\n\nis well established that certain statutory claims may  be decided\n\nthrough arbitration.    See  Gilmer  v.  Interstate/Johnson  Lane\n                                                                 \n\nCorp., 500  U.S.  20, 26  (1991);  Page v.

We\n                        \n\nsee no reason why the arbitrator cannot make the factual findings\n\nnecessary  to resolve the   302  issue in this case.  Determining\n\nthe   status  of  owner-operators   is  particularly  within  the\n\narbitrator's domain  since it involves  analyzing various aspects\n\nof  the  working  relationship  between  the  parties.    Such  a\n\ndetermination  involves consideration  of precisely  the  type of\n\nissues  that  the parties  originally  agreed  to  refer  to  the\n\narbitrator under the arbitration clause of the Project Agreement.\n\nWe  do, nevertheless,  retain jurisdiction  so that  the district\n\ncourt can review  the final determination  of the arbitrator,  if\n\nrequested to do so by one of the parties.\n\n                               -19-\n\n          On remand,  we expect  the arbitrator will  conduct the\n\nappropriate  agency test  analysis as  described in  the relevant\n\ncaselaw.   See, e.g.,  Amber,  651 F.2d at 60-61;  Local No. 221,\n                                                                \n\n899 F.2d  at 1240;  North Am.

We leave it  to the arbitrator  to decide\n\nwhat effect, if  any, the  past practices clause  of the  Project\n\nAgreement  and  the  evidence  of  past  practice  regarding  the\n\ntreatment  of owner-operators  has  on his  determination of  the\n\nowner-operators' status  under    302.

Instead,   courts  must   confine  themselves   to\n\ndetermining whether the arbitrator's construction of the contract\n\nwas in any way plausible.\n\n          The issue in this case is whether any plausible reading\n\nof a  collective bargaining  agreement  supports an  arbitrator's\n\nruling   in  a   dispute  over   fringe   benefit  contributions.\n\nPlaintiffs-appellees, J.M.  Cashman, Inc. and R.  Zoppo Co., Inc.\n\n(the  \"plaintiffs\"  or  \"Cashman   and  Zoppo\"),  challenged  the\n\narbitration   order,   which  favored   the  defendant-appellant,\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters,  Chauffeurs, Warehousemen\n\nand Helpers of American, Local 379 (the \"Union\"), in the district\n\ncourt.   The  district court  vacated the  arbitration award  and\n\nremanded  the dispute to the  arbitrator for a  new resolution of\n\nthe  case.   Because  we find  that  the district  court  stepped\n\noutside  of  its  highly  circumscribed  role  of  assessing  the\n\nplausibility of the arbitrator's interpretation  of the agreement\n\nbetween   the   parties,   we   reverse   the  court's   holding.\n\nNevertheless,  we agree  with the  district  court that  the case\n\n                               -2-\n\nshould  be remanded to the arbitrator for resolution of a related\n\nissue of federal law.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          This case arises  out of the  arbitration of a  dispute\n\nbetween the Union and  a group of contractor-employers, including\n\nplaintiffs  Cashman and  Zoppo, involved  in the  construction of\n\nwaste water  treatment facilities  in Boston Harbor  (the \"Boston\n\nHarbor Project\").  On  March 2, 1992, the Union  filed grievances\n\nagainst Cashman, Zoppo, and six other project employers, claiming\n\nthat truck drivers  on the  Boston Harbor Project  who owned  and\n\ndrove  their  own  trucks,  so  called \"owner-operators,\"  should\n\nreceive certain  fringe benefit contributions  that the employers\n\nwere  already paying  on behalf  of other  Boston  Harbor Project\n\nemployees.    The  grievances  asserted that  the  Boston  Harbor\n\nProject  Labor Agreement  (\"Project  Agreement\"),  signed by  the\n\nUnion  and  the employers,  required  that the  same  \"health and\n\nwelfare  contributions  and all  pension  contributions\"  made on\n\nbehalf of  other employees  must also  be made on  behalf of  the\n\nowner-operators.\n\n          The employers  claimed that  they did  not have  to pay\n\nfringe benefits on behalf of owner-operators because the contract\n\ndid not require it  and, more importantly, because the  Union and\n\nmany  of the employers had a long-standing practice of not paying\n\nsuch  owner-operator  benefits  going  back at  least  twenty-six\n\nyears.  According to the employers, this practice was established\n\nafter the Union  and certain employer-contractors on a  number of\n\n                               -3-\n\nstate  construction projects  (not  including  Cashman and  Zoppo\n\nthemselves)  agreed  that, to  the  extent  a nucleus  of  owner-\n\noperator  truck  drivers  would  be  present  on  any  individual\n\nconstruction project, the  employers would not be required to pay\n\nfringe benefits  for the owner-operators.   The employers working\n\non  the  Boston Harbor  Project, who  were  required to  sign the\n\nProject  Agreement in  order to  bid initially  on the  work, see\n                                                                 \n\nBuilding  &amp;  Constr.

In his accompanying opinion,  the arbitrator explained\n\nthat  certain provisions  of the  Massachusetts Teamsters'  Heavy\n\nConstruction   Agreement   (\"Teamsters  Agreement\"),   which  was\n\nincorporated into the Project  Agreement, in conjunction with the\n\nProject Agreement itself, explicitly obligated employers to  make\n\n                               -4-\n\nhealth  insurance  and pension  contributions  on  behalf of  the\n\nowner-operators in question.\n\n          At  issue in  this appeal  is the  arbitrator's finding\n\nthat  the past  practice of  not paying  the fringe  benefits for\n\nowner-operators did not bind the parties in this case because the\n\nProject Agreement \"wiped the slate clean\" of such past practices.\n\nThe arbitrator relied on  the following language in  the preamble\n\nof the Project Agreement to support his finding:\n\n            No  practice, understanding  or agreement\n            between  a Contractor  and a  Union party\n            which is not explicitly set forth in this\n            Agreement shall  be binding on  any other\n            party  unless endorsed in  writing by the\n            Project Contractor.\n\nBy  interpreting this language as negating all past practices and\n\nunderstandings  not  explicitly  set  forth  within  the  Project\n\nAgreement,  the  arbitrator disregarded  the  voluminous evidence\n\npresented  by  the  employers  of  the  established  practice  of\n\nexcluding  owner-operators from fringe benefit contributions.  As\n\na result,  the language  of the  Project Agreement granting  such\n\nbenefits was found to be controlling.\n\n          Also at  issue on  appeal is  the  related question  of\n\nwhether   the  owner-operator   truck  drivers   are  independent\n\ncontractors or  employees.  If they  are independent contractors,\n\nSection 302  of the Labor  Management Relations Act  (\"LMRA\"), 29\n\nU.S.C.    186,  would prohibit fringe  benefit payments  on their\n\nbehalf.    The arbitrator  acknowledged  that  the employers  had\n\nargued that fringe benefit payments for the owner-operators would\n\nbe illegal under  Section 302, but he  made no explicit  legal or\n\n                               -5-\n\nfactual findings on the issue in his opinion.  While a  rejection\n\nof  the employers'  contention was  implicit in  the arbitrator's\n\naward favoring  the Union, nothing indicates  that the arbitrator\n\nactually determined whether the owner-operators were employees or\n\nindependent contractors for purposes of the LMRA.\n\n          Following  the entry of the arbitrator's award, Cashman\n\nand Zoppo filed a complaint in the district court on February 19,\n\n1993, requesting that  the court  vacate the award.   On  summary\n\njudgment,  the  district  court  held  that  the  arbitrator  had\n\nimpermissibly exceeded his authority by misapplying the plain and\n\nunambiguous language of the Project Agreement preamble concerning\n\npast  practices, thereby  failing to  duly consider  the evidence\n\nthat the parties had a practice of not paying fringe benefits for\n\nowner-operators.    The  district   court  found  that  the  past\n\npractices provision  of the  preamble -- particularly  the words,\n\n\"no practice . . . shall be binding on any other party\" (emphasis\n                                                      \n\nadded)  --  clearly  and  unambiguously  meant  that  established\n\npractices between parties A and  B are not meant to  bind outside\n\nparty C.  The court found that the phrase could not reasonably be\n\ninterpreted to  mean that  all established practices,  even those\n\nbetween parties A  and B, are completely wiped out by the Project\n\nAgreement.   Consequently, the  court held  that the Union  could\n\nstill  be  bound by  the past  practice  of not  requiring fringe\n\nbenefit contributions for  owner-operators.   The district  court\n\nvacated  the  arbitrator's award  and  remanded the  case  to the\n\narbitrator to  determine the merits,  giving proper consideration\n\n                               -6-\n\nto the evidence of past practices.\n\n          The court  also left  for the  arbitrator the  issue of\n\nwhether,  in light  of  the court's  holding that  past practices\n\ncould   be  considered,   the  owner-operators   are  independent\n\ncontractors,  thus rendering  the  payment of  benefits on  their\n\nbehalf illegal.\n\n                          II.

The Past Practices Clause\n                                       \n\n          With   this   circumscribed   standard  for   reviewing\n\narbitration awards in  mind, there  is little  question that  the\n\narbitrator's interpretation of the  Project Agreement -- at least\n\n                               -9-\n\nto the extent  that he found that the  past practices clause bars\n\nconsideration of the plaintiffs' evidence of prior fringe benefit\n                               \n\narrangements  -- must  be upheld  as a  plausible reading  of the\n\ncontract.   This  result  is compelled  because the  arbitrator's\n\nholding comports with the  district court's own interpretation of\n\nthe past practices clause  when properly applied to the  facts of\n\nthis case.  Thus,  even if the arbitrator exceeded  his authority\n\nin finding that the  past practices clause wiped the  slate clean\n\nof  all established practices between all parties, an issue we do\n\nnot decide, he certainly  did not exceed his authority  by wiping\n\nthe  slate clean  between the  Union and  the plaintiffs  in this\n\nparticular case.\n\n          The  district court  apparently failed to  consider the\n\npossibility that plaintiffs in this case are  \"other parties\" and\n\ntherefore not  privy to  the past  practice  of excluding  owner-\n\noperators  from the payment of fringe benefits.  According to the\n\ndistrict  court,  the  plain   language  of  the  past  practices\n\nprovision  in the  preamble provides  merely that  past practices\n\nestablished between parties A and B shall not be binding on party\n\nC,  although  they  will  continue  to  be  binding  on  A and  B\n\nthemselves.   Applying  this interpretation  to the  present case\n\nreveals that fringe benefit practices between the Union and other\n\nemployer-contractors (parties  \"A\" and \"B\" respectively)  are not\n\nbinding on the plaintiffs (both party \"C's\"), who did not have an\n\nestablished  past practice with the Union and are thus \"any other\n\nparties\"  under  the past  practices clause.    As a  result, the\n\n                               -10-\n\ncontract  could be  read  to  require  the arbitrator  to  ignore\n\nevidence of  past practices between  the Union and  other parties\n\nwhen applying the provisions of the Project Agreement to disputes\n\nbetween   the  Union  and  the   plaintiffs.    Because  such  an\n\ninterpretation is a plausible one,  we must reverse the  district\n\ncourt's vacation  of the arbitration  ruling with respect  to the\n\narbitrator's construction of the Project Agreement.\n\n          The plaintiffs  take issue with such  an application of\n\nthe past practices clause to the  facts of this case.  They argue\n\nthat because the  Union itself was privy  to the practice  of not\n\nrequiring fringe benefit payments for owner-operators,  the Union\n\ncan still be  held to that practice, regardless  of the fact that\n\nplaintiffs  cannot  in  any way  be  bound  by  such a  practice.\n\nPlaintiffs point to the language of the clause, which states that\n\n\"[n]o practice . . . between a Contractor and a Union party . . .\n\nshall be  binding on any other  party,\" to argue that  the clause\n\nitself concerns only the effects of past practices on new parties\n\nto the project agreement but in  no way limits the effect of past\n\npractices on the Union itself.\n\n          The plaintiffs' interpretation is certainly reasonable,\n\nbut, for  our purposes, it  is also irrelevant.   Our task  is to\n\ndetermine  whether  the  arbitrator  exceeded  his  authority  by\n\nfailing to apply the contract in a plausible manner, not to  seek\n\nout the  most reasonable meaning  of the contract.   Interpreting\n\nthe  past practices  clause to  bar consideration  of plaintiffs'\n\nevidence of past practice in this case is clearly plausible.  The\n\n                               -11-\n\nclause  can be  read to preclude  application of  all established\n\npast practices to \"any  other party,\" even if that practice is in\n\nthe  \"other party's\" favor.   Such  a reading  stems from  one of\n\nseveral plausible  constructions of  the language in  the clause:\n\n(1) no practice between parties A  and B shall be binding between\n\nparties  A and  C;  (2) practices  not  binding  on party  C  are\n\nlikewise unavailable to C for use against parties A or B (i.e., C\n\nis not  entitled to rely on  or benefit from a  practice which is\n\nnot  binding on  itself); and  (3) no  practice shall  be binding\n\nunlessalreadyestablished betweenaUnion andaparticular contractor.\n\n          In this case, the  arbitrator could plausibly find that\n\nthe practice  of excluding fringe  benefits for  owner-operators,\n\nestablished  between  the Union  and  other  contractors, is  not\n\nbinding between the Union and the plaintiffs.  Alternatively, the\n\narbitrator  could find  that plaintiffs  cannot benefit  from the\n\npast fringe benefit  practice because each  plaintiff is an  \"any\n\nother party\"  and thus could not be bound by the practice were it\n\nbeneficial to the Union instead of to the employer.\n\n          Plaintiffs  protest  that  we  cannot  now  employ such\n\nreasoning to  retroactively  salvage an  otherwise  unsustainable\n\narbitration  award.   They  point out  that  even if  the Union's\n\ninterpretation  of the  past practices  clause is  plausible, the\n\narbitrator  did not  arrive at  that interpretation  himself, but\n\ninstead,  arrived at  an  interpretation that  ignored the  plain\n\nlanguage of the  contract.   The arbitrator found  that the  past\n\npractices clause wiped  the slate clean of all  practices between\n\n                               -12-\n\nall  parties, not  just  practices between  parties  A and  C  as\n\ndiscussed  above.    The  arbitration  award  cannot  be  upheld,\n\nplaintiffs argue,  on  the  basis  of an  interpretation  of  the\n\ncontract  that the arbitrator did not even make, because, in this\n\ncase  at least,  the arbitrator  might have  come to  a different\n\nconclusion  as  to  whether   past  practice  evidence  could  be\n\nconsidered if  he adopted the district  court's interpretation of\n\nthe past practices clause at the time of his decision.\n\n          We  see  no  problem with  upholding  the  arbitrator's\n\ndecision on  grounds or reasoning not employed  by the arbitrator\n\nhimself.  To begin with, an arbitrator  has no obligation to give\n\nhis  or her  reasons for  an  award.   Raytheon Co.  v.

Rather, we know\n\nthe  arbitrator   did  not  exceed  his   authority  because  his\n\n                               -14-\n\napplication of the past practice clause to the plaintiffs' claims\n\ndrew  its  essence  from  the  collective  bargaining  agreement.\n\nTherefore, we  need not speculate  how the arbitrator  might have\n\nresolved  this  case  had  he  considered  the  district  court's\n\nconstruction of the contract language at issue.\n\n          C.

Given that a determination under    302 could\n\nhave  criminal  consequences, the  plaintiffs deserve  a thorough\n\njudicial review of an arbitrator's decision as to this issue.\n\n          Neither party disputes that the plaintiffs' payment  of\n\nfringe benefits on behalf of the owner-operators is illegal under\n\n  302  if the owner-operators are  independent contractors rather\n\nthan employees.  The parties do disagree, however, on whether the\n\nissue was properly decided by the arbitrator and, if not, how the\n\nissue  should now  be resolved.   The  plaintiffs argue  that the\n\narbitrator did not properly decide the issue and  that we, or the\n\ndistrict  court,   should  find  that   the  owner-operators  are\n\n                               -15-\n\nindependent contractors, effectively  nullifying the  arbitration\n\naward.  The Union argues that the arbitrator correctly found that\n\nthe owner-operators were employees and that we should uphold this\n\nfinding.\n\n          The  arbitrator  did,  at  the  very  least, implicitly\n\ndecide  the    302 issue  by granting  an award  in favor  of the\n\nUnion.    However,  we  are  not satisfied  that  the  arbitrator\n\nconducted  the  appropriate  statutory analysis  for  making  the\n\nrequired  factual determination  of the  owner-operator's status.\n\nDistinguishing  between employees and independent contractors for\n\npurposes  of the LMRA is governed by general principles of agency\n\nlaw.

There is no  reason to believe, as the Union seems\n\nto  suggest, that  the arbitrator's  decision regarding  the past\n\npractices clause, which we uphold in this opinion, is dispositive\n\nnot only of the underlying contractual dispute, but of the    302\n\nissue as well.  Past practices are only one facet of the complete\n\nagency  test  under      302.    Consequently,  the  arbitrator's\n\ndiscussion  of  the  Project Agreement  and  the  import  of past\n\npractices concerning  the owner-operators, while relevant  to the\n\nparties'  intended working relationship and thus to the status of\n\nthe owner-operators  in this  case, is  not itself  sufficient to\n\nconvince  us that  a  complete    302  agency test  analysis  was\n\nundertaken.   We  cannot,  therefore, defer  to the  arbitrator's\n\nimplicit factual finding on the owner-operators' status to uphold\n\nthe arbitration award  until a  more complete    302 analysis  is\n\nconducted.\n\n          We are not prepared,  however, to conduct that analysis\n\nourselves without first giving  the arbitrator the opportunity to\n\nreexamine  the factual  circumstances of  this case.   Plaintiffs\n\n                               -17-\n\nasserted  in  their action  before  the district  court  that the\n\narbitration award  is unenforceable  because it  violates federal\n\nlaw.   The district court  declined to review  this claim because\n\nthe  court vacated  the arbitration  award on  the issue  of past\n\npractices.  Because we now  reverse the district court's  ruling,\n\nwe are left with plaintiffs'   302 allegations, which have yet to\n\nbe properly adjudicated.   In  turn, we are  not disposed  toward\n\nmaking  factual findings in the first instance, given the absence\n\nof  explicit factual  findings  from the  district  court or  the\n\narbitrator, that  are required for a proper  determination of the\n\nowner-operators'  status.    Although  a  largely  uncontradicted\n\nrecord exists in  this case that would allow us  to resolve the  \n\n302 issue if we  needed to, we consider ourselves too far removed\n\nfrom the dispute to properly  weigh the various factors  involved\n\nin this  fact-intensive determination.  In other words, we refuse\n\nto uphold the arbitrator's finding because plaintiffs have raised\n\na claim meriting  federal judicial  review yet we,  as a  federal\n\nappeals court, are  not in  a suitable position  to conduct  that\n\nreview.\n\n          Unfortunately,  the  district  court  is  in  the  same\n\nposition that we are in with respect to determining the status of\n\nowner-operators.   Consequently,  we decline  to remand  the case\n\ndirectly to  the district  court for a  resolution of  the    302\n\nissue.  The district court itself chose to remand the proceedings\n\ninstead of deciding the merits of the case and we think it is the\n\ncourt's prerogative to  do so.   Although federal  courts have  a\n\n                               -18-\n\nduty to  scrutinize such  federal issues with  potential criminal\n\nconsequences,  the  arbitrator  can  play an  important  role  in\n\nproviding  first-hand factual  findings  for the  benefit of  the\n\nreviewing  court.     Therefore,  we  remand  this  case  to  the\n\narbitrator for  a  separate determination  of the  status of  the\n\nowner-operators under   302.\n\n          The plaintiffs  do not dispute our  authority to remand\n\nactions   to  the   arbitrator;   however,  they   claim  it   is\n\ninappropriate to do so when the issue on remand is one of federal\n\nlaw.   We disagree with their contention that it is inappropriate\n\nfor an arbitrator to apply federal statutes.  On the contrary, it\n\nis well established that certain statutory claims may  be decided\n\nthrough arbitration.    See  Gilmer  v.  Interstate/Johnson  Lane\n                                                                 \n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112584\"><a href=\"/opinion/112584/gilmer-v-interstatejohnson-lane-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26  (1991);  Page v.

We\n                        \n\nsee no reason why the arbitrator cannot make the factual findings\n\nnecessary  to resolve the   302  issue in this case.  Determining\n\nthe   status  of  owner-operators   is  particularly  within  the\n\narbitrator's domain  since it involves  analyzing various aspects\n\nof  the  working  relationship  between  the  parties.    Such  a\n\ndetermination  involves consideration  of precisely  the  type of\n\nissues  that  the parties  originally  agreed  to  refer  to  the\n\narbitrator under the arbitration clause of the Project Agreement.\n\nWe  do, nevertheless,  retain jurisdiction  so that  the district\n\ncourt can review  the final determination  of the arbitrator,  if\n\nrequested to do so by one of the parties.\n\n                               -19-\n\n          On remand,  we expect  the arbitrator will  conduct the\n\nappropriate  agency test  analysis as  described in  the relevant\n\ncaselaw.
