Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                 \n\n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r                                                      \n               Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r                                                          \n\n                                         \n\nDavid H.

We have reviewed  the parties' briefs  and\r                           \n\nthe  record on appeal.   We affirm the  denial of appellant's\n\nmotion  to  withdraw his  guilty  plea,  essentially for  the\n\nreasons stated in  the district court's  order of August  22,\n\n1994.\n\n     We add only  the following.  There  was no error in  the\n\ndistrict  court's  declining  to  receive  the  testimony  of\n\nappellant's co-defendant, Robin  Greenan, at  the hearing  on\n\nthe motion  to withdraw the  guilty plea.   Greenan's counsel\n\nstated that  Greenan would  invoke her Fifth  Amendment right\n\nagainst  self-incrimination.    Greenan,  herself,  signed an\n\naffidavit stating  her intention to  invoke that right.   The\n\ninformation  that Greenan  allegedly could  offer to  bolster\n\nappellant's  claim of  innocence  had  already been  provided\n\nthrough  the testimony  of  appellant's former  counsel.   In\n\nthese  circumstances, the  district court  did not  abuse its\n\ndiscretion  in deciding not to  put Ms. Greenan  on the stand\n\nfor  the purpose of invoking her Fifth Amendment right and in\n\nconcluding   that  the   proffered   information   would   be\n\ncumulative.\n\n     The joint motion to submit this appeal on briefs without\n\noral argument is granted.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Loc. R.\r                                                                \n\n27.1.\r\r\n",
