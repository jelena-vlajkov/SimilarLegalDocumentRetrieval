This appeal  concerns an  attempt by\r                                 \n\nappellant   Edward  Siguel  to   collect  benefits  under  an\n\naccidental death and dismemberment insurance policy issued by\n\nappellee Allstate Life Insurance Co. to Siguel's father.  The\n\ndistrict court  entered judgment  for Allstate under  Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 52(c) after  Siguel presented his evidence at  a non-\n\njury trial.1\n\n                              I.\r                                           \n\n          In  1986 Siguel obtained  the insurance policy from\n\nAllstate;  he  listed  his  father, Isidoro  Siguel,  as  the\n\ninsured  and his  mother, Berta  Siguel, as  the beneficiary.\n\nAccording  to  Siguel  the   insured,  while  in   Argentina,\n\nsustained  an injury  to  his left  forearm  from a  blow  he\n\nreceived  while getting  off  a public  bus.   This  accident\n\noccurred sometime in January 1988.  On February 10, 1988, the\n\ninsured  went  to  a  hospital  out-patient  clinic  where  a\n\nphysician, Dr.  Pattin, drained  an abscess on  the insured's\n\nleft forearm.  Later that same day, the insured died.\n\n          Siguel  filed a claim in June 1988 on behalf of his\n\nmother  for benefits  under the  policy.   As proof  of loss,\n\nSiguel submitted  a death certificate which  listed the cause\n\nof death  as cardiorespiratory arrest; he  also submitted two\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Rule 52(c) provides that  \"[i]f during a trial  without a\njury a party  has been fully heard on an  issue and the court\nfinds  against the party on  that issue, the  court may enter\njudgment as a matter of law against that party . . . .\"\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nreports  prepared  by  Dr.   Pattin  which  stated  that  the\n\ninsured's death was accidental.  Allstate denied the claim on\n\nDecember 27,  1989.   It had  conducted an  investigation and\n\nconcluded that the  cause of death  was not the result  of an\n\naccident  as defined in the  insurance policy.   On March 28,\n\n1991, Siguel  filed an action  in federal  district court  on\n\nbehalf of his mother as the beneficiary.2\n\n          The parties  engaged in discovery and  the case was\n\ntried  in  January  1994.   The  district  court  first heard\n\nSiguel's evidence  and argument  that his father's  death was\n\naccidental.   It then made Rule 52(c) findings concerning the\n\ncause  of death.    The court  initially  determined that  an\n\naccident had occurred on  the bus.  However, the  court found\n\nthat Siguel  had not demonstrated  by a preponderance  of the\n\nevidence  that the  accident  had resulted  in the  insured's\n\ndeath.    Specifically, the  court  concluded  there were  no\n\ncausal connections,  first, between  the accident on  the bus\n\nand the  abscess and,  second, between  the  abscess and  the\n\ndeath.   The court further  stated that the  existence of the\n\nlink was not a matter that could be proved without the aid of\n\nexpert testimony.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  At this time, Berta Siguel was represented by her son and\nanother  attorney.   For  ease of  reference, Siguel  will be\ntreated as the plaintiff  except where his status as  both an\nattorney and party is the issue.\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          The court then  rejected Siguel's  theory that  the\n\nmedical treatment  of the abscess itself  was faulty, thereby\n\nconstituting an accident  which caused the death.   The court\n\nstated  that there  was insufficient  evidence from  which it\n\ncould  find that the draining of the abscess was an accident.\n\nAgain, the court opined that it required expert  testimony to\n\nestablish that  there was something wrong  with the treatment\n\nand that this error was responsible for  the insured's death.\n\nThe court  also rejected  Siguel's argument that  because his\n\nfather did not expect  to die, his death was  accidental; the\n\ncourt described  this legal  theory as incorrect  and without\n\nany support in the caselaw.\n\n                             II.\r                                           \n\n          On appeal,  Siguel claims  that the  district court\n\nerred by  (A) ruling on the merits  in favor of Allstate; (B)\n\ndenying  Siguel's  motion for  a  new  trial; (C)  permitting\n\nAllstate  to  file late  responses  to  Siguel's request  for\n\nadmissions;  (D) disqualifying  Siguel from  representing his\n\nmother; (E) denying Siguel  (who the court allowed  to appear\n\npro se after his mother assigned her claims to him) the right\n\nto have  a lawyer assist  him at trial;  and (F) refusing  to\n\nassess costs or sanctions against Allstate.\n\n          A.  The Merits.\r                                    \n\n          As with  any case involving  questions of insurance\n\ncoverage,  we  start with  the language  of  the policy.   It\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nprovides  benefits  if the  person insured  is injured  in an\n\naccident.  Injury or injured is defined as meaning\n\n          bodily  injury  caused  by   an  accident\r                                                               \n          occurring while the insurance is in force\n          and  which injury results within 365 days\n          after the date  of the accident, directly\n          and independently of all other causes, in\n          death or any other \"Loss\" covered  by the\n          Policy. (emphasiss added).\n\nIf an individual  is injured  while a passenger  on a  public\n\nconveyance the  benefit  is $200,000.    In other  cases  the\n\nbenefit is $60,000.\n\n          Siguel first argues that the district court  should\n\nhave used the  \"accidental results\" approach  to interpreting\n\nthis  kind   of  insurance  contract  and   that  it  instead\n\nerroneously  used an  \"accidental  means\" test.3   Under  the\n\nlatter test, \"the  means which produced death  or injury must\r                                    \n\nhave been unintentional.\"  Wickman v. Northwestern Nat'l Ins.\r                                                                         \n\nCo.,  908 F.2d 1077, 1085  (1st Cir.) (emphasis added), cert.\r                                                                         \n\ndenied, 498 U.S. 1013 (1990).  A results approach focusses on\r                  \n\nthe unexpected  nature of the  injury or death  itself; thus,\n\n\"where the death is  not designed and not anticipated  by the\n\ndeceased, though it is in consequence of some act voluntarily\n\ndone  by him, it is accidental death.\"  10 Couch on Insurance\r                                                                         \n\n2d   41:29, at 44 (rev. ed. 1982).\r              \n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  The  district court,  with  the consent  of the  parties,\napplied  Illinois and  Massachusetts  law  to this  insurance\ncontract, finding  that there  was no difference  between the\nlaw of the two jurisdictions.     \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          Under both approaches, however, an accident must be\n\nthe proximate cause of the harm or loss.      \n\n             Irrespective of  whether or not  it is\n          required that  the means, as well  as the\n          result, be accidental  in origin, it  has\n          been held that  in determining whether or\n          not a  recovery will be  allowed . .  . a\n          court may require that the accident  be a\n          proximate cause  of the injury  or death,\n          regardless  of the  fact that  the policy\n          may not set up this requirement.\n\n1A Appleman, Insurance Law  and Practice   362, at  482 (rev.\r                                                    \n\ned. 1981) (footnotes omitted); Couch on Insurance   41:12, at\r                                                             \n\n16 (\"In order to bring the harm sustained within the coverage\n\nof an accident policy,  it is necessary that the  accident be\n\nthe  proximate  cause  of  the  harm  sustained.\")  (footnote\n\nomitted).\n\n          We  first note  that the  insurance policy  in this\n\ncase  in fact requires that death be \"caused by an accident.\"\n\nSecond, the  courts of  both Illinois and  Massachusetts have\n\nheld that to obtain benefits under this kind of insurance, an\n\naccident must be the proximate cause of death or injury.  See\r                                                                         \n\nCarlson v. New York Life Ins. Co., 76 Ill. App.  2d 187, 196,\r                                             \n\n222 N.E.2d 363, 368 (1966) (where there is both a preexisting\n\nillness  and  an accidental  injury,  \"the  pivotal issue  is\n\nwhether the accidental injury was the proximate cause of  the\n\nresulting loss\"); Coleman v. American Casualty Co., 354 Mass.\r                                                              \n\n762,  762, 237  N.E.2d  22, 22  (1968)  (where the  insurance\n\npolicy provides  recovery for  \"loss  resulting directly  and\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nindependently  of  all other  causes  from  accidental bodily\n\ninjury,\"  there must be  evidence that but  for the insured's\n\naccidental fall,  the loss would  not have occurred).   Thus,\n\nthe  district court  did not err  in determining  that Siguel\n\nmust  show that  his father's  death was  precipitated by  an\n\naccident.\n\n          This also takes care  of Siguel's argument that for\n\ndeath to be  accidental all  that is required  is that it  be\n\nunexpected  from the  insured's  point of  view.   While  the\n\nresults  approach  speaks  of  an  unexpected  and unforeseen\n\nresult,   there  is  no   indication  in  the   case  law  or\n\ncommentaries  that  the  unexpected  nature of  the  loss  is\n\nsufficient,  without  more,  to trigger  coverage.    Indeed,\n\nSiguel does not cite any cases so holding.  Wickman, on which\r                                                               \n\nSiguel  primarily  relies,  is  distinguishable.   There  the\n\ndeceased  was observed standing outside  of a guardrail on an\n\noverpass  section  of  an  interstate  highway.   Immediately\n\nbefore the deceased  fell to his death, he  was holding on to\n\nthe guardrail with only one hand.\n\n          To determine whether this  death was accidental, we\n\nheld  that  a  factfinder  must begin  with  the  \"reasonable\n\nexpectations\" of the insured.  908 F.2d at 1088.  If there is\n\ninsufficient  evidence of  the insured's  point of  view, the\n\nfinder  of fact  then  should then  ask whether  a reasonable\n\nperson  in  the insured's  position  \"would  have viewed  the\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\ninjury as highly likely to occur as a result of the insured's\n\nintentional conduct.\"   Id.   Based on  these principles,  we\r                                       \n\nupheld  the magistrate's  finding that  the deceased  knew or\n\nshould  have known that death was a likely consequence of his\n\nintentional act in  standing on the outside  of the guardrail\n\nand holding on with one hand.  Id. at 1088-89.\r                                              \n\n          It  is obvious that the issue in Wickman was how to\r                                                              \n\ndetermine  when   the  result   of  an  intentional   act  is\r                                                               \n\ninadvertent.     Focussing  on  the   insured's  expectations\n\nregarding the outcome of  his or her behavior makes  sense in\n\nthis  context.  Here, though, there is no allegation that the\n\ninsured's conduct contributed in any way to his death.  Thus,\n\nhis expectations regarding when he would die are immaterial.\n\n          Siguel  similarly argues  that his  father did  not\n\nexpect  to die  after  having the  abscess  on his  left  arm\n\ndrained.   Thus, he  asserts, when death  unexpectedly occurs\n\nduring  a   medical  procedure,   it  should  be   viewed  as\n\naccidental.   However, where medical treatment  is not sought\n\nfor  an accident, the \"mere fact that  the insured dies . . .\n\nas a result of such treatment does not constitute an accident\n\n. . .  .\"  Couch on Insurance   41:113,  at 187.  There is no\r                                         \n\nevidence that, first, the accident on the bus resulted in the\n\nabscess (the  reason treatment  was sought) or,  second, that\n\nthere was anything wrong  with the way in which  the draining\n\nprocedure was performed.\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\n          Siguel next asserts that because his father did not\n\nexpect  to  suffer  cardiorespiratory  failure,  the  illness\n\nitself  was  accidental.   Siguel  then  posits that  if  the\n\ncardiorespiratory failure was an accident, his father's death\n\nwas  accidental.  Siguel first  set forth this  theory in his\n\nmotion  for reconsideration filed after trial  ended.  In any\n\nevent, Siguel again ignores the requirement of causation.\n\n          For  example,  in  Scholle  v.   Continental  Nat'l\r                                                                         \n\nAmerican Group, 44 Ill.  App. 3d 716, 358 N.E.2d  893 (1976),\r                          \n\nthe  insured  fell  and   subsequently  died  of  a  ruptured\n\naneurysm.   The  court held  that  to recover,  plaintiff was\n\nrequired to produce direct or circumstantial evidence to show\n\nthat there  was a \"causal relationship\" between  the fall and\n\nthe burst  aneurysm.  44 Ill.  App. 3d at 721,  358 N.E.2d at\n\n897.   Thus,  \"[w]here there  is no  occurrence which  may be\n\ndeemed  an accident,  it  necessarily follows  that the  harm\n\nsustained as the consequence  of a disease is not  within the\n\ncoverage of an  accident policy.\"   10 Couch  on Insurance   \r                                                                      \n\n41:70, at 105 (footnotes omitted).\n\n          Siguel finally avers that  the district court erred\n\nby requiring expert medical testimony to link the accident on\n\nthe  bus, or  the draining  of the  abscess, to  his father's\n\ndeath.  He argues that because the insurance contract did not\n\nrequire  expert testimony,  the  court could  not demand  it.\n\nSiguel  fails to cite any law in support of this proposition.\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nFurther, cases from  both Illinois  and Massachusetts  reveal\n\nthat experts  routinely testify  concerning this issue.

New Trial Motion.\r                                          \n\n          Siguel requested a new trial based on his assertion\n\nthat the district court  had misunderstood the law concerning\n\naccidental death insurance contracts and because Allstate had\n\nrefused  to  turn  over  to  Siguel  the  transcript  of  the\n\ndeposition of  Dr. Pinto, the physician  who had investigated\n\nthe claim for Allstate in Argentina.  We review the denial of\n\na motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.   deMars v.\r                                                                      \n\nEquitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the United States, 610 F.2d\r                                                               \n\n55, 64 (1st Cir. 1979).\n\n          Based on  our discussion of the  merits of Siguel's\n\nclaim,  we  find  that  the  court  was  fully  justified  in\n\nrejecting  the motion for a new trial.  As for the transcript\n\nof  Dr. Pinto's  deposition, we  make only  two observations.\n\nFirst, Siguel  does not specify what  information provided by\n\nDr.  Pinto would  have  helped him  in establishing  that the\n\ninsured's death  was accidental.  Second,  Siguel was present\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nat the deposition  and obtained a  transcript of Dr.  Pinto's\n\ntestimony  prior to  the end  of trial.    Thus, there  is no\n\nexcuse for Siguel's failure so to specify.        \n\n          C.  Request for Admissions.\r                                                \n\n          On March  28, 1991,  Siguel filed the  complaint in\n\nthis  case.   At  the  same  time, he  served  a  request for\n\nadmissions,  interrogatories,  and a  request  for documents.\n\nAllstate  and Siguel agreed to extend the time for the filing\n\nof the  answers to the  interrogatories and the  responses to\n\nthe document request.  Allstate states  that it believed that\n\nthe parties  also had  agreed to  extend the  time for  it to\n\nanswer the  request for admissions.   Siguel claims  that the\n\nagreement  never  applied  to  the  request  for  admissions.\n\nTherefore,  on June  24,  1991, Allstate  filed  a motion  to\n\nwithdraw  the matters deemed admitted by  its failure to file\n\ntimely  responses  and  a  motion  to  extend  the  time  for\n\nresponding  to the  admissions request.   Siguel  opposed the\n\nmotions  and, on  July 3,  1991, filed  a motion  for summary\n\njudgment based on the  factual issues \"admitted\" by Allstate.\n\nOn  September  18,  a  magistrate  judge  granted  Allstate's\n\nmotions.\n\n          Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 36(a) provides  that a  matter is\n\ndeemed admitted  unless a response  is filed \"within  30 days\n\nafter  service of  the  request, or  within  such shorter  or\n\nlonger  time as the court  may allow .  . . .\"   The district\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\ncourt  may not  only extend  the time  for filing  answers to\n\nrequests for admissions, but also may permit withdrawal of an\n\nadmission \"when the presentation of  the merits of the action\n\nwill be  subserved thereby  and  the party  who obtained  the\n\nadmission  fails to satisfy the  court that withdrawal  . . .\n\nwill  prejudice  that  party  in maintaining  the  action  or\n\ndefense on the  merits.\" Fed. R. Civ. P.  36(b).  Contrary to\n\nSiguel's  assertion, the focus under Rule 36(b) is not on the\n\nmoving  party's explanations for  its non-complaince with the\n\nRule.   See F.D.I.C. v.  Prusia, 18 F.3d  637, 640 (8th  Cir.\r                                           \n\n1994).   Thus,  Allstate is  not  required to  show excusable\n\nneglect.   Id. (citation omitted).   We review  a decision to\r                          \n\nallow withdrawal of admissions for abuse of discretion.  Farr\r                                                                         \n\nMan &amp; Co. v. M/V Rozita, 903 F.2d 871, 876 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                   \n\n          The magistrate judge found that  the matters deemed\n\nadmitted  were determinative  of  all the  material facts  in\n\nissue.  As a result, \"[t]he first half of the test is clearly\n\nsatisfied since the effect  of upholding the admissions would\n\nbe to practically eliminate  any presentation of the merits.\"\n\nWestmoreland v. Triumph Motorcycle  Corp., 71 F.R.D. 192, 193\r                                                     \n\n(D.  Conn. 1976).  We  thus turn to  whether Siguel satisfied\n\nhis  burden  of demonstrating  prejudice  to  his ability  to\n\nmaintain the action. \n\n          Siguel  claims  that Allstate's  \"delaying tactics\"\n\nheld  up the  proceedings and  prevented him  from conducting\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\ndiscovery for almost one  year.  Specifically, Siguel asserts\n\nthat  during  this  time  he  refrained  from  searching  for\n\nwitnesses  who  might  have  had  knowledge  concerning   the\n\ncircumstances of the insured's  death.  Siguel also complains\n\nthat he was unable to conduct discovery prior to the district\n\ncourt's  decision  allowing   withdrawal  of  the  admissions\n\nbecause he did not  know what facts  were in dispute.   These\n\nclaims  are unavailing.   Siguel knew from  the time Allstate\n\ndenied  coverage in  1989  that  it  was  alleging  that  his\n\nfather's death was not an accident and that this would be the\n\nmajor issue in the case.    \n\n          Further, prejudice under Rule 36(b) \"relates to the\n\ndifficulty a party may face in proving its case, e.g., caused\r                                                                 \n\nby the unavailability of key witnesses, because of the sudden\n\nneed  to  obtain  evidence  with  respect  to  the  questions\n\npreviously  answered by  the admissions.\"   Brook  Village N.\r                                                                         \n\nAssociates  v. General Elec. Co.,  686 F.2d 66,  70 (1st Cir.\r                                            \n\n1982).    There was  no \"sudden  need\"  for Siguel  to obtain\n\nevidence here.   He was on  notice as of  June 24, 1991  that\n\nAllstate was attempting to withdraw its admissions.  This was\n\nsoon  after the case was initiated and quite a while before a\n\ntrial  likely  would occur.    Finally, that  Siguel  filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment shortly after  Allstate requested\n\nwithdrawal of  the admissions does  not constitute prejudice.\n\nSee F.D.I.C. v.  Prusia, 18 F.3d at 640.   Given our finding,\r                                   \n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nwe do not think that the district court erred  in refusing to\n\naward costs to Siguel.\n\n          D.  Disqualification.\r                                          \n\n          In February  1992, Allstate  moved  to have  Siguel\n\ndisqualified from representing his  mother on the ground that\n\nhe would be  a witness  in the case.   On March  23, 1992,  a\n\nmagistrate judge  denied the motion without  prejudice to its\n\nrenewal.  She  acknowledged the financial hardship  attendant\n\nupon securing new counsel and recognized that the proceedings\n\nstill  were  in the  discovery stage.   However,  she ordered\n\nSiguel's mother to obtain co-counsel by May 18, 1992.\n\n          Siguel  then moved  for  an extension  of time  and\n\nAllstate  sought   reconsideration  of  the  denial   of  the\n\ndisqualification motion.   The  magistrate judge  gave Siguel\n\nuntil  September  30  to   secure  co-counsel.    Instead  of\n\ncomplying with the magistrate judge's directive, Siguel filed\n\na motion to permit him to substitute himself as the plaintiff\n\nin  the case.   In January 1993,  and without ruling  on this\n\nmotion,  the  magistrate judge  recommended disqualification.\n\nShe found that Siguel's role as a witness would conflict with\n\nhis duty to  his mother  effectively to represent  her.   The\n\ndistrict court agreed and adopted her recommendation.\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\n          We review a decision disqualifying an attorney from\n\nrepresenting  his or  her  client for  abuse of  discretion.4\n\nFiandaca v.  Cunningham, 827 F.2d  825, 828 (1st  Cir. 1987).\r                                   \n\nDisciplinary  Rule 5-102(A),  359 Mass. 796  (1972), provides\n\nthat an  attorney who learns that he \"ought to be called as a\n\nwitness on behalf of his client . . . shall withdraw from the\n\nconduct of the  trial . . .  .\"  One of the  reasons for this\n\nrule is  that if  a lawyer  appears both  as an advocate  and\n\nwitness, \"he becomes more easily impeachable for interest and\n\nthus may be a less effective witness.\"  Borman v. Borman, 378\r                                                                    \n\nMass.  775,  786,  393   N.E.2d  847,  855  (1979)  (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).    \n\n          The  magistrate  judge  found  that  Siguel,  as  a\n\nphysician, had been involved in his father's health care from\n\n1982  through 1987.   He  had discussed  with Dr.  Pattin the\n\nevents that led  to the draining of  the abscess and  typed a\n\nreport  from Dr.  Pattin's  handwritten notes.   This  report\n\nconcluded  that the  accident  on  the  bus  had  caused  the\n\ninsured's death.  Dr. Pattin signed the report before he (Dr.\n\nPattin)  died.   Further, Siguel  was an  active (if  not the\n\nsole) participant in  the attempt to gain  benefits under the\n\ninsurance policy.  \n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  Allstate argues that Siguel has no standing to raise this\nclaim as  his mother no longer  is a party.   Because we find\nthat his  claim fails on  the merits, we  do not address  the\nstanding question.\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\n          Disqualification is appropriate  where an  attorney\n\nis  intimately involved in  the events that  form the subject\n\nmatter of the  action.   American Hosp. Supply  Corp. v.  Roy\r                                                                         \n\nLapidus,  Inc.,  493 F.  Supp.  1076, 1078  (D.  Mass. 1980);\r                          \n\nSerody  v. Serody,  19 Mass.  App. Ct.  411, 415,  474 N.E.2d\r                             \n\n1171,  1174 (1985).  It  is apparent from  the foregoing that\n\nSiguel's familiarity  with most of the  facts underlying this\n\naction makes it almost  certain that he will  be called as  a\n\nwitness.   Also  of relevance  is that the  information about\n\nwhich Siguel probably would testify is not readily obtainable\n\nfrom other sources.  See  Serody, 19 Mass. App. Ct. at   414,\r                                            \n\n474 N.E.2d at 1174.\n\n          In his role as a witness, Siguel's credibility will\n\nbe  an  issue.     For  example,  the   parties  contest  the\n\nadmissability  of  Dr.  Pattin's  report;  Siguel's  part  in\n\ncreating that report  will not aid his mother's case.  As the\n\nSupreme   Judicial   Court   pointed   out,   the   need  for\n\ndisqualification  is the  greatest where  the outcome  of the\n\ncase  likely  will  turn on  the  lawyer's  credibility as  a\n\nwitness.  Borman, 378 Mass. at 786-87, 393 N.E.2d at 855.\r                            \n\n          Siguel  argues that  DR  5-102(A)  only applies  to\n\ntrial  and not to discovery  proceedings.  He  cites no cases\n\nfor this  proposition.  It seems to us that if new counsel is\n\nto take  over at trial, the  sooner he or she  is involved in\n\nthe case the better for the client.  To wait until the eve of\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n\ntrial  would hamper  the presentation  of the  case --  not a\n\nresult, we  think,  contemplated by  the disciplinary  rules.\n\nSiguel also posits that  since there was a non-jury  trial in\n\nthis  case, there was no  chance of the  judge being confused\n\nover  his  appearance  as  both witness  and  lawyer.    This\n\nargument   misses  the  mark.    The   concern  is  over  the\n\ncredibility of a  lawyer who also appears as  a witness and a\n\njudge assesses credibility just as the jury does.\n\n          Finally,  Siguel  maintains   that  requiring   his\n\nwithdrawal  worked a  \"substantial  hardship\" on  his mother.\n\nSee DR 5-101(B)(4),  359 Mass. 796 (1972).   Specifically, he\r               \n\nalleges that  she did not  have the financial  wherewithal to\n\nhire another attorney.  We  do not agree.  As  the magistrate\n\njudge pointed  out, the  case is  not especially  complex and\n\nanother attorney could master  the facts and the issues  in a\n\ncomparatively  short  period of  time.   In  any  event, this\n\nproblem was  solved when the district  court permitted Siguel\n\nto accept the  assignment of  the claim from  his mother  and\n\ngranted Siguel's motion to appear pro se.\n\n          E.  Assistance of Counsel.\r                                               \n\n          Once the  court granted Siguel leave  to appear pro\n\nse,  Siguel requested that he  be allowed to  hire counsel to\n\nassist  him in  trying  the case.    He argued  that just  as\n\nAllstate had  hired local counsel,  he too should  be allowed\n\nthe  same opportunity.  The  court denied the motion, stating\n\n                             -17-\r\r\n\nthat  it did not \"permit a combination  of a lawyer and a pro\n\nse.\"   Siguel argues that by so holding, the court improperly\n\ncreated a new local rule.  Siguel's claim lacks merit.\n\n            28 U.S.C.    1654 provides that  \"[i]n all courts\n\nof  the United States the parties may plead and conduct their\n\nown cases  personally or by counsel  . . . .\"   Siguel admits\n\nthat   he  could  not  find  any  cases  in  support  of  his\n\ninterpretation  of   1654.   The reason, we  think, is plain.\n\n\"Section  1654 does  not itself  confer any right  to `hybrid\n\nrepresentation.'\"  O'Reilly v.  New York Times Co.,  692 F.2d\r                                                              \n\n863,  868 (2d  Cir.  1982)  (to  claim  the  right  to  self-\n\nrepresentation,  a  party  must  \"clearly  and  unequivocally\n\ndischarge any lawyer\").  Thus, the district court's denial of\n\nSiguel's request  to employ a  lawyer to  aid him was  not in\n\nerror.              \n\n          F.  Costs and Sanctions.\r                                             \n\n          Siguel  appeals from  the  denial by  the  district\n\ncourt  of a motion for sanctions (docket # 188) filed shortly\n\nbefore  trial  commenced.     Siguel  sought  sanctions   for\n\nAllstate's alleged  (1) failure to comply  with deadlines for\n\nfiling pleadings  and responding  to discovery  requests, (2)\n\nfailure to prepare a joint  stipulation concerning procedures\n\nfor the  taking of depositions  in Argentina, (3)  failure to\n\nfile a  joint statement of  undisputed facts, (4)  failure to\n\nprepare a list of documents it considered privileged, and (5)\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\nfailure to serve subpoenas in compliance with Fed.

Siguel  also claims  that the  district court  erred in\n\ngranting  an extension of time to Allstate to file its answer\n\nto  an  amended  complaint;  Siguel asserts  that  the  court\n\ngranted this  motion on  the mistaken assumption  that Siguel\n\nhad not filed an opposition to an extension of time.\n\n     We have reviewed  the record and the parties' briefs and\n\ncannot  find  that  the   district  court  abused  the  broad\n\ndiscretion  it has in  these areas.

According to Siguel the insured, while in Argentina, sustained an injury to his left forearm from a blow he received while getting off a public bus.  This accident occurred sometime in January 1988.  On February 10, 1988, the insured went to a hospital out- patient clinic where a physician, Dr. Pattin, drained an abscess on the insured's left forearm.  Later that same day, the insured died.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel filed a claim in June 1988 on behalf of his mother for benefits under the policy.  As proof of loss, Siguel submitted a death certificate which listed the cause of death as cardiorespiratory arrest;  he also submitted two reports prepared by Dr. Pattin which stated that the insured's death was accidental.  Allstate denied the claim on December 27, 1989.  It had conducted an investigation and concluded that the cause of death was not the result of an accident as defined in the insurance policy.  On March 28, 1991, Siguel filed an action in federal district court on behalf of his mother as the beneficiary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties engaged in discovery and the case was tried in January 1994.  The district court first heard Siguel's evidence and argument that his father's death was accidental.  It then made Rule 52(c) findings concerning the cause of death.  The court initially determined that an accident had occurred on the bus.  However, the court found that Siguel had not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the accident had resulted in the insured's death.  Specifically, the court concluded there were no causal connections, first, between the accident on the bus and the abscess and, second, between the abscess and the death.  The court further stated that the existence of the link was not a matter that could be proved without the aid of expert testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then rejected Siguel's theory that the medical treatment of the abscess itself was faulty, thereby constituting an accident which caused the death.  The court stated that there was insufficient evidence from which it could find that the draining of the abscess was an accident.  Again, the court opined that it required expert testimony to establish that there was something wrong with the treatment and that this error was responsible for the insured's death.  The court also rejected Siguel's argument that because his father did not expect to die, his death was accidental;  the court described this legal theory as incorrect and without any support in the caselaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Siguel claims that the district court erred by (A) ruling on the merits in favor of Allstate;  (B) denying Siguel's motion for a new trial;  (C) permitting Allstate to file late responses to Siguel's request for admissions;  (D) disqualifying Siguel from representing his mother;  (E) denying Siguel (who the court allowed to appear pro se after his mother assigned her claims to him) the right to have a lawyer assist him at trial;  and (F) refusing to assess costs or sanctions against Allstate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A.

It provides benefits if the person insured is injured in an accident.  Injury or injured is defined as meaning</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>bodily injury caused by an accident occurring while the insurance is in force and which injury results within 365 days after the date of the accident, directly and independently of all other causes, in death or any other \"Loss\" covered by the Policy.

In other cases the benefit is $60,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel first argues that the district court should have used the \"accidental results\" approach to interpreting this kind of insurance contract and that it instead erroneously used an \"accidental means\" test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Under the latter test, \"the means which produced death or injury must have been unintentional.\"  Wickman v. Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co., 908 F.2d 1077, 1085 (1st Cir.)  (emphasis added), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1013 (1990).  A results approach focusses on the unexpected nature of the injury or death itself;  thus, \"where the death is not designed and not anticipated by the deceased, though it is in consequence of some act voluntarily done by him, it is accidental death.\"  10 Couch on Insurance 2d Sec. 41:29, at 44 (rev. ed. 1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under both approaches, however, an accident must be the proximate cause of the harm or loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Irrespective of whether or not it is required that the means, as well as the result, be accidental in origin, it has been held that in determining whether or not a recovery will be allowed ... a court may require that the accident be a proximate cause of the injury or death, regardless of the fact that the policy may not set up this requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1A Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice Sec. 362, at 482 (rev. ed. 1981) (footnotes omitted);  Couch on Insurance Sec. 41:12, at 16 (\"In order to bring the harm sustained within the coverage of an accident policy, it is necessary that the accident be the proximate cause of the harm sustained.\")  (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first note that the insurance policy in this case in fact requires that death be \"caused by an accident.\"  Second, the courts of both Illinois and Massachusetts have held that to obtain benefits under this kind of insurance, an accident must be the proximate cause of death or injury.  See Carlson v. New York Life Ins. Co., 76 Ill.  App. 2d 187, 196, 222 N.E.2d 363, 368 (1966) (where there is both a preexisting illness and an accidental injury, \"the pivotal issue is whether the accidental injury was the proximate cause of the resulting loss\");  Coleman v. American Casualty Co., 354 Mass. 762, 762, 237 N.E.2d 22, 22 (1968) (where the insurance policy provides recovery for \"loss resulting directly and independently of all other causes from accidental bodily injury,\" there must be evidence that but for the insured's accidental fall, the loss would not have occurred).  Thus, the district court did not err in determining that Siguel must show that his father's death was precipitated by an accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This also takes care of Siguel's argument that for death to be accidental all that is required is that it be unexpected from the insured's point of view.  While the results approach speaks of an unexpected and unforeseen result, there is no indication in the case law or commentaries that the unexpected nature of the loss is sufficient, without more, to trigger coverage.  Indeed, Siguel does not cite any cases so holding.  Wickman, on which Siguel primarily relies, is distinguishable.  There the deceased was observed standing outside of a guardrail on an overpass section of an interstate highway.  Immediately before the deceased fell to his death, he was holding on to the guardrail with only one hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether this death was accidental, we held that a factfinder must begin with the \"reasonable expectations\" of the insured.  908 F.2d at 1088.  If there is insufficient evidence of the insured's point of view, the finder of fact then should then ask whether a reasonable person in the insured's position \"would have viewed the injury as highly likely to occur as a result of the insured's intentional conduct.\"  Id. Based on these principles, we upheld the magistrate's finding that the deceased knew or should have known that death was a likely consequence of his intentional act in standing on the outside of the guardrail and holding on with one hand.  Id. at 1088-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is obvious that the issue in Wickman was how to determine when the result of an intentional act is inadvertent.  Focussing on the insured's expectations regarding the outcome of his or her behavior makes sense in this context.  Here, though, there is no allegation that the insured's conduct contributed in any way to his death.  Thus, his expectations regarding when he would die are immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel similarly argues that his father did not expect to die after having the abscess on his left arm drained.  Thus, he asserts, when death unexpectedly occurs during a medical procedure, it should be viewed as accidental.  However, where medical treatment is not sought for an accident, the \"mere fact that the insured dies ... as a result of such treatment does not constitute an accident....\"  Couch on Insurance Sec. 41:113, at 187.  There is no evidence that, first, the accident on the bus resulted in the abscess (the reason treatment was sought) or, second, that there was anything wrong with the way in which the draining procedure was performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel next asserts that because his father did not expect to suffer cardiorespiratory failure, the illness itself was accidental.  Siguel then posits that if the cardiorespiratory failure was an accident, his father's death was accidental.  Siguel first set forth this theory in his motion for reconsideration filed after trial ended.  In any event, Siguel again ignores the requirement of causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in Scholle v. Continental Nat'l American Group, 44 Ill.  App. 3d 716, 358 N.E.2d 893 (1976), the insured fell and subsequently died of a ruptured aneurysm.  The court held that to recover, plaintiff was required to produce direct or circumstantial evidence to show that there was a \"causal relationship\" between the fall and the burst aneurysm.  44 Ill.  App. 3d at 721, 358 N.E.2d at 897.  Thus, \"[w]here there is no occurrence which may be deemed an accident, it necessarily follows that the harm sustained as the consequence of a disease is not within the coverage of an accident policy.\"  10 Couch on Insurance Sec. 41:70, at 105 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel finally avers that the district court erred by requiring expert medical testimony to link the accident on the bus, or the draining of the abscess, to his father's death.  He argues that because the insurance contract did not require expert testimony, the court could not demand it.  Siguel fails to cite any law in support of this proposition.  Further, cases from both Illinois and Massachusetts reveal that experts routinely testify concerning this issue.  See Wahls v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 122 Ill.  App. 3d 309, 461 N.E.2d 466 (1983);  Carlson v. New York Life Ins. Co., supra, 76 Ill.  App. 2d 187, 222 N.E.2d 363;  Barnett v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 304 Mass. 564, 24 N.E.2d 662 (1939);  Wrobel .v General Accident, Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp., 288 Mass. 206, 192 N.E. 498 (1934).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>B. New Trial Motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel requested a new trial based on his assertion that the district court had misunderstood the law concerning accidental death insurance contracts and because Allstate had refused to turn over to Siguel the transcript of the deposition of Dr. Pinto, the physician who had investigated the claim for Allstate in Argentina.  We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. deMars v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the United States, 610 F.2d 55, 64 (1st Cir. 1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our discussion of the merits of Siguel's claim, we find that the court was fully justified in rejecting the motion for a new trial.  As for the transcript of Dr. Pinto's deposition, we make only two observations.  First, Siguel does not specify what information provided by Dr. Pinto would have helped him in establishing that the insured's death was accidental.  Second, Siguel was present at the deposition and obtained a transcript of Dr. Pinto's testimony prior to the end of trial.  Thus, there is no excuse for Siguel's failure so to specify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>C. Request for Admissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 28, 1991, Siguel filed the complaint in this case.  At the same time, he served a request for admissions, interrogatories, and a request for documents.  Allstate and Siguel agreed to extend the time for the filing of the answers to the interrogatories and the responses to the document request.  Allstate states that it believed that the parties also had agreed to extend the time for it to answer the request for admissions.  Siguel claims that the agreement never applied to the request for admissions.  Therefore, on June 24, 1991, Allstate filed a motion to withdraw the matters deemed admitted by its failure to file timely responses and a motion to extend the time for responding to the admissions request.  Siguel opposed the motions and, on July 3, 1991, filed a motion for summary judgment based on the factual issues \"admitted\" by Allstate.  On September 18, a magistrate judge granted Allstate's motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a) provides that a matter is deemed admitted unless a response is filed \"within 30 days after service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the court may allow....\"  The district court may not only extend the time for filing answers to requests for admissions, but also may permit withdrawal of an admission \"when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal ... will prejudice that party in maintaining the action or defense on the merits.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b).  Contrary to Siguel's assertion, the focus under Rule 36(b) is not on the moving party's explanations for its non-compliance with the Rule.  See F.D.I.C. v. Prusia, 18 F.3d 637, 640 (8th Cir. 1994).  Thus, Allstate is not required to show excusable neglect.  Id. (citation omitted).  We review a decision to allow withdrawal of admissions for abuse of discretion.  Farr Man &amp; Co. v. M/V Rozita, 903 F.2d 871, 876 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge found that the matters deemed admitted were determinative of all the material facts in issue.  As a result, \"[t]he first half of the test is clearly satisfied since the effect of upholding the admissions would be to practically eliminate any presentation of the merits.\"  Westmoreland v. Triumph Motorcycle Corp., 71 F.R.D. 192, 193 (D. Conn. 1976).  We thus turn to whether Siguel satisfied his burden of demonstrating prejudice to his ability to maintain the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel claims that Allstate's \"delaying tactics\" held up the proceedings and prevented him from conducting discovery for almost one year.  Specifically, Siguel asserts that during this time he refrained from searching for witnesses who might have had knowledge concerning the circumstances of the insured's death.  Siguel also complains that he was unable to conduct discovery prior to the district court's decision allowing withdrawal of the admissions because he did not know what facts were in dispute.  These claims are unavailing.  Siguel knew from the time Allstate denied coverage in 1989 that it was alleging that his father's death was not an accident and that this would be the major issue in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, prejudice under Rule 36(b) \"relates to the difficulty a party may face in proving its case, e.g., caused by the unavailability of key witnesses, because of the sudden need to obtain evidence with respect to the questions previously answered by the admissions.\"  Brook Village N. Associates v. General Elec. Co., 686 F.2d 66, 70 (1st Cir. 1982).  There was no \"sudden need\" for Siguel to obtain evidence here.  He was on notice as of June 24, 1991 that Allstate was attempting to withdraw its admissions.  This was soon after the case was initiated and quite a while before a trial likely would occur.  Finally, that Siguel filed a motion for summary judgment shortly after Allstate requested withdrawal of the admissions does not constitute prejudice.  See F.D.I.C. v. Prusia, 18 F.3d at 640.  Given our finding, we do not think that the district court erred in refusing to award costs to Siguel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>D. Disqualification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1992, Allstate moved to have Siguel disqualified from representing his mother on the ground that he would be a witness in the case.  On March 23, 1992, a magistrate judge denied the motion without prejudice to its renewal.  She acknowledged the financial hardship attendant upon securing new counsel and recognized that the proceedings still were in the discovery stage.  However, she ordered Siguel's mother to obtain co-counsel by May 18, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel then moved for an extension of time and Allstate sought reconsideration of the denial of the disqualification motion.  The magistrate judge gave Siguel until September 30 to secure co-counsel.  Instead of complying with the magistrate judge's directive, Siguel filed a motion to permit him to substitute himself as the plaintiff in the case.  In January 1993, and without ruling on this motion, the magistrate judge recommended disqualification.  She found that Siguel's role as a witness would conflict with his duty to his mother effectively to represent her.  The district court agreed and adopted her recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a decision disqualifying an attorney from representing his or her client for abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Fiandaca v. Cunningham, 827 F.2d 825, 828 (1st Cir. 1987).  Disciplinary Rule 5-102(A), 359 Mass. 796 (1972), provides that an attorney who learns that he \"ought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client ... shall withdraw from the conduct of the trial....\"  One of the reasons for this rule is that if a lawyer appears both as an advocate and witness, \"he becomes more easily impeachable for interest and thus may be a less effective witness.\"  Borman v. Borman, 378 Mass. 775, 786, 393 N.E.2d 847, 855 (1979) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge found that Siguel, as a physician, had been involved in his father's health care from 1982 through 1987.  He had discussed with Dr. Pattin the events that led to the draining of the abscess and typed a report from Dr. Pattin's handwritten notes.  This report concluded that the accident on the bus had caused the insured's death.  Dr. Pattin signed the report before he (Dr. Pattin) died.  Further, Siguel was an active (if not the sole) participant in the attempt to gain benefits under the insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disqualification is appropriate where an attorney is intimately involved in the events that form the subject matter of the action.  American Hosp. Supply Corp. v. Roy Lapidus, Inc., 493 F. Supp. 1076, 1078 (D. Mass. 1980);  Serody v. Serody, 19 Mass.  App. Ct. 411, 415, 474 N.E.2d 1171, 1174 (1985).  It is apparent from the foregoing that Siguel's familiarity with most of the facts underlying this action makes it almost certain that he will be called as a witness.  Also of relevance is that the information about which Siguel probably would testify is not readily obtainable from other sources.  See Serody, 19 Mass.  App. Ct. at 414, 474 N.E.2d at 1174.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his role as a witness, Siguel's credibility will be an issue.  For example, the parties contest the admissability of Dr. Pattin's report;  Siguel's part in creating that report will not aid his mother's case.  As the Supreme Judicial Court pointed out, the need for disqualification is the greatest where the outcome of the case likely will turn on the lawyer's credibility as a witness.  Borman, 378 Mass. at 786-87, 393 N.E.2d at 855.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel argues that DR 5-102(A) only applies to trial and not to discovery proceedings.  He cites no cases for this proposition.  It seems to us that if new counsel is to take over at trial, the sooner he or she is involved in the case the better for the client.  To wait until the eve of trial would hamper the presentation of the case-not a result, we think, contemplated by the disciplinary rules.  Siguel also posits that since there was a non-jury trial in this case, there was no chance of the judge being confused over his appearance as both witness and lawyer.  This argument misses the mark.  The concern is over the credibility of a lawyer who also appears as a witness and a judge assesses credibility just as the jury does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Siguel maintains that requiring his withdrawal worked a \"substantial hardship\" on his mother.  See DR 5-101(B)(4), 359 Mass. 796 (1972).  Specifically, he alleges that she did not have the financial wherewithal to hire another attorney.  We do not agree.  As the magistrate judge pointed out, the case is not especially complex and another attorney could master the facts and the issues in a comparatively short period of time.  In any event, this problem was solved when the district court permitted Siguel to accept the assignment of the claim from his mother and granted Siguel's motion to appear pro se.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>E. Assistance of Counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the court granted Siguel leave to appear pro se, Siguel requested that he be allowed to hire counsel to assist him in trying the case.  He argued that just as Allstate had hired local counsel, he too should be allowed the same opportunity.  The court denied the motion, stating that it did not \"permit a combination of a lawyer and a pro se.\"  Siguel argues that by so holding, the court improperly created a new local rule.  Siguel's claim lacks merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. Sec. 1654 provides that \"[i]n all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel....\"  Siguel admits that he could not find any cases in support of his interpretation of Sec. 1654.  The reason, we think, is plain.  \"Section 1654 does not itself confer any right to 'hybrid representation.' \"  O'Reilly v. New York Times Co., 692 F.2d 863, 868 (2d Cir. 1982) (to claim the right to self-representation, a party must \"clearly and unequivocally discharge any lawyer\").

R. Civ. P. 45.  Siguel also claims that the district court erred in granting an extension of time to Allstate to file its answer to an amended complaint;  Siguel asserts that the court granted this motion on the mistaken assumption that Siguel had not filed an opposition to an extension of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have reviewed the record and the parties' briefs and cannot find that the district court abused the broad discretion it has in these areas.

The district court entered judgment for Allstate under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 52(c) after Siguel presented his evidence at a non-jury trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986 Siguel obtained the insurance policy from Allstate;  he listed his father, Isidoro Siguel, as the insured and his mother, Berta Siguel, as the beneficiary.  According to Siguel the insured, while in Argentina, sustained an injury to his left forearm from a blow he received while getting off a public bus.  This accident occurred sometime in January 1988.  On February 10, 1988, the insured went to a hospital out- patient clinic where a physician, Dr. Pattin, drained an abscess on the insured's left forearm.  Later that same day, the insured died.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel filed a claim in June 1988 on behalf of his mother for benefits under the policy.  As proof of loss, Siguel submitted a death certificate which listed the cause of death as cardiorespiratory arrest;  he also submitted two reports prepared by Dr. Pattin which stated that the insured's death was accidental.  Allstate denied the claim on December 27, 1989.  It had conducted an investigation and concluded that the cause of death was not the result of an accident as defined in the insurance policy.  On March 28, 1991, Siguel filed an action in federal district court on behalf of his mother as the beneficiary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties engaged in discovery and the case was tried in January 1994.  The district court first heard Siguel's evidence and argument that his father's death was accidental.  It then made Rule 52(c) findings concerning the cause of death.  The court initially determined that an accident had occurred on the bus.  However, the court found that Siguel had not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the accident had resulted in the insured's death.  Specifically, the court concluded there were no causal connections, first, between the accident on the bus and the abscess and, second, between the abscess and the death.  The court further stated that the existence of the link was not a matter that could be proved without the aid of expert testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then rejected Siguel's theory that the medical treatment of the abscess itself was faulty, thereby constituting an accident which caused the death.  The court stated that there was insufficient evidence from which it could find that the draining of the abscess was an accident.  Again, the court opined that it required expert testimony to establish that there was something wrong with the treatment and that this error was responsible for the insured's death.  The court also rejected Siguel's argument that because his father did not expect to die, his death was accidental;  the court described this legal theory as incorrect and without any support in the caselaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Siguel claims that the district court erred by (A) ruling on the merits in favor of Allstate;  (B) denying Siguel's motion for a new trial;  (C) permitting Allstate to file late responses to Siguel's request for admissions;  (D) disqualifying Siguel from representing his mother;  (E) denying Siguel (who the court allowed to appear pro se after his mother assigned her claims to him) the right to have a lawyer assist him at trial;  and (F) refusing to assess costs or sanctions against Allstate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A.

A results approach focusses on the unexpected nature of the injury or death itself;  thus, \"where the death is not designed and not anticipated by the deceased, though it is in consequence of some act voluntarily done by him, it is accidental death.\"  10 Couch on Insurance 2d Sec. 41:29, at 44 (rev. ed. 1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under both approaches, however, an accident must be the proximate cause of the harm or loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Irrespective of whether or not it is required that the means, as well as the result, be accidental in origin, it has been held that in determining whether or not a recovery will be allowed ... a court may require that the accident be a proximate cause of the injury or death, regardless of the fact that the policy may not set up this requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1A Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice Sec. 362, at 482 (rev. ed. 1981) (footnotes omitted);  Couch on Insurance Sec. 41:12, at 16 (\"In order to bring the harm sustained within the coverage of an accident policy, it is necessary that the accident be the proximate cause of the harm sustained.\")  (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first note that the insurance policy in this case in fact requires that death be \"caused by an accident.\"  Second, the courts of both Illinois and Massachusetts have held that to obtain benefits under this kind of insurance, an accident must be the proximate cause of death or injury.  See Carlson v. New York Life Ins. Co., 76 Ill.  App. 2d 187, 196, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008279\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008279/carlson-v-new-york-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span>, 368 (1966) (where there is both a preexisting illness and an accidental injury, \"the pivotal issue is whether the accidental injury was the proximate cause of the resulting loss\");  Coleman v. American Casualty Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></span>, 762, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></span>, 22 (1968) (where the insurance policy provides recovery for \"loss resulting directly and independently of all other causes from accidental bodily injury,\" there must be evidence that but for the insured's accidental fall, the loss would not have occurred).  Thus, the district court did not err in determining that Siguel must show that his father's death was precipitated by an accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This also takes care of Siguel's argument that for death to be accidental all that is required is that it be unexpected from the insured's point of view.  While the results approach speaks of an unexpected and unforeseen result, there is no indication in the case law or commentaries that the unexpected nature of the loss is sufficient, without more, to trigger coverage.  Indeed, Siguel does not cite any cases so holding.  Wickman, on which Siguel primarily relies, is distinguishable.  There the deceased was observed standing outside of a guardrail on an overpass section of an interstate highway.  Immediately before the deceased fell to his death, he was holding on to the guardrail with only one hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether this death was accidental, we held that a factfinder must begin with the \"reasonable expectations\" of the <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545155\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">insured.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/545155/mary-jane-wickman-v-northwestern-national-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1088</span></a></span>.  If there is insufficient evidence of the insured's point of view, the finder of fact then should then ask whether a reasonable person in the insured's position \"would have viewed the injury as highly likely to occur as a result of the insured's intentional conduct.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545155\"><a href=\"/opinion/545155/mary-jane-wickman-v-northwestern-national-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Based on </a></span>these principles, we upheld the magistrate's finding that the deceased knew or should have known that death was a likely consequence of his intentional act in standing on the outside of the guardrail and holding on with one hand.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545155\"><a href=\"/opinion/545155/mary-jane-wickman-v-northwestern-national-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1088-89.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is obvious that the issue in Wickman was how to determine when the result of an intentional act is inadvertent.  Focussing on the insured's expectations regarding the outcome of his or her behavior makes sense in this context.  Here, though, there is no allegation that the insured's conduct contributed in any way to his death.  Thus, his expectations regarding when he would die are immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel similarly argues that his father did not expect to die after having the abscess on his left arm drained.  Thus, he asserts, when death unexpectedly occurs during a medical procedure, it should be viewed as accidental.  However, where medical treatment is not sought for an accident, the \"mere fact that the insured dies ... as a result of such treatment does not constitute an accident....\"  Couch on Insurance Sec. 41:113, at 187.  There is no evidence that, first, the accident on the bus resulted in the abscess (the reason treatment was sought) or, second, that there was anything wrong with the way in which the draining procedure was performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel next asserts that because his father did not expect to suffer cardiorespiratory failure, the illness itself was accidental.  Siguel then posits that if the cardiorespiratory failure was an accident, his father's death was accidental.  Siguel first set forth this theory in his motion for reconsideration filed after trial ended.  In any event, Siguel again ignores the requirement of causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in Scholle v. Continental Nat'l American Group, 44 Ill.

The court held that to recover, plaintiff was required to produce direct or circumstantial evidence to show that there was a \"causal relationship\" between the fall and the burst aneurysm.  44 Ill.  App. 3d at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">721,</span> <span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">897</span></span>.  Thus, \"[w]here there is no occurrence which may be deemed an accident, it necessarily follows that the harm sustained as the consequence of a disease is not within the coverage of an accident policy.\"  10 Couch on Insurance Sec. 41:70, at 105 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel finally avers that the district court erred by requiring expert medical testimony to link the accident on the bus, or the draining of the abscess, to his father's death.  He argues that because the insurance contract did not require expert testimony, the court could not demand it.  Siguel fails to cite any law in support of this proposition.  Further, cases from both Illinois and Massachusetts reveal that experts routinely testify concerning this issue.  See Wahls v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 122 Ill.

As for the transcript of Dr. Pinto's deposition, we make only two observations.  First, Siguel does not specify what information provided by Dr. Pinto would have helped him in establishing that the insured's death was accidental.  Second, Siguel was present at the deposition and obtained a transcript of Dr. Pinto's testimony prior to the end of trial.  Thus, there is no excuse for Siguel's failure so to specify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>C.

At the same time, he served a request for admissions, interrogatories, and a request for documents.  Allstate and Siguel agreed to extend the time for the filing of the answers to the interrogatories and the responses to the document request.  Allstate states that it believed that the parties also had agreed to extend the time for it to answer the request for admissions.  Siguel claims that the agreement never applied to the request for admissions.  Therefore, on June 24, 1991, Allstate filed a motion to withdraw the matters deemed admitted by its failure to file timely responses and a motion to extend the time for responding to the admissions request.  Siguel opposed the motions and, on July 3, 1991, filed a motion for summary judgment based on the factual issues \"admitted\" by Allstate.  On September 18, a magistrate judge granted Allstate's motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ.

We thus turn to whether Siguel satisfied his burden of demonstrating prejudice to his ability to maintain the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel claims that Allstate's \"delaying tactics\" held up the proceedings and prevented him from conducting discovery for almost one year.  Specifically, Siguel asserts that during this time he refrained from searching for witnesses who might have had knowledge concerning the circumstances of the insured's death.  Siguel also complains that he was unable to conduct discovery prior to the district court's decision allowing withdrawal of the admissions because he did not know what facts were in dispute.  These claims are unavailing.  Siguel knew from the time Allstate denied coverage in 1989 that it was alleging that his father's death was not an accident and that this would be the major issue in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, prejudice under Rule 36(b) \"relates to the difficulty a party may face in proving its case, e.g., caused by the unavailability of key witnesses, because of the sudden need to obtain evidence with respect to the questions previously answered by the admissions.\"  Brook Village N. Associates v. General Elec.

There was no \"sudden need\" for Siguel to obtain evidence here.  He was on notice as of June 24, 1991 that Allstate was attempting to withdraw its admissions.  This was soon after the case was initiated and quite a while before a trial likely would occur.  Finally, that Siguel filed a motion for summary judgment shortly after Allstate requested withdrawal of the admissions does not constitute prejudice.  See F.D.I.C. v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664718\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Prusia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/664718/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-richard-prusia-federal-deposit/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>.

Disqualification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1992, Allstate moved to have Siguel disqualified from representing his mother on the ground that he would be a witness in the case.  On March 23, 1992, a magistrate judge denied the motion without prejudice to its renewal.  She acknowledged the financial hardship attendant upon securing new counsel and recognized that the proceedings still were in the discovery stage.  However, she ordered Siguel's mother to obtain co-counsel by May 18, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel then moved for an extension of time and Allstate sought reconsideration of the denial of the disqualification motion.  The magistrate judge gave Siguel until September 30 to secure co-counsel.  Instead of complying with the magistrate judge's directive, Siguel filed a motion to permit him to substitute himself as the plaintiff in the case.  In January 1993, and without ruling on this motion, the magistrate judge recommended disqualification.  She found that Siguel's role as a witness would conflict with his duty to his mother effectively to represent her.  The district court agreed and adopted her recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a decision disqualifying an attorney from representing his or her client for abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Fiandaca v.

He had discussed with Dr. Pattin the events that led to the draining of the abscess and typed a report from Dr. Pattin's handwritten notes.  This report concluded that the accident on the bus had caused the insured's death.  Dr. Pattin signed the report before he (Dr. Pattin) died.  Further, Siguel was an active (if not the sole) participant in the attempt to gain benefits under the insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disqualification is appropriate where an attorney is intimately involved in the events that form the subject matter of the action.

It is apparent from the foregoing that Siguel's familiarity with most of the facts underlying this action makes it almost certain that he will be called as a witness.  Also of relevance is that the information about which Siguel probably would testify is not readily obtainable from other sources.  See Serody, 19 Mass.  App. Ct. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1988325\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">414,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1988325/serody-v-serody/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1174</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his role as a witness, Siguel's credibility will be an issue.  For example, the parties contest the admissability of Dr. Pattin's report;  Siguel's part in creating that report will not aid his mother's case.  As the Supreme Judicial Court pointed out, the need for disqualification is the greatest where the outcome of the case likely will turn on the lawyer's credibility as a witness.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2082752\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Borman,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2082752/borman-v-borman/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> at <span class=\"page\">786-87</span></a></span>, 393 N.E.2d at 855.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel argues that DR 5-102(A) only applies to trial and not to discovery proceedings.  He cites no cases for this proposition.  It seems to us that if new counsel is to take over at trial, the sooner he or she is involved in the case the better for the client.  To wait until the eve of trial would hamper the presentation of the case-not a result, we think, contemplated by the disciplinary rules.  Siguel also posits that since there was a non-jury trial in this case, there was no chance of the judge being confused over his appearance as both witness and lawyer.  This argument misses the mark.  The concern is over the credibility of a lawyer who also appears as a witness and a judge assesses credibility just as the jury does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Siguel maintains that requiring his withdrawal worked a \"substantial hardship\" on his mother.  See DR 5-101(B)(4), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span> </span>(1972).  Specifically, he alleges that she did not have the financial wherewithal to hire another attorney.  We do not agree.  As the magistrate judge pointed out, the case is not especially complex and another attorney could master the facts and the issues in a comparatively short period of time.  In any event, this problem was solved when the district court permitted Siguel to accept the assignment of the claim from his mother and granted Siguel's motion to appear pro se.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>E. Assistance of Counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the court granted Siguel leave to appear pro se, Siguel requested that he be allowed to hire counsel to assist him in trying the case.  He argued that just as Allstate had hired local counsel, he too should be allowed the same opportunity.  The court denied the motion, stating that it did not \"permit a combination of a lawyer and a pro se.\"  Siguel argues that by so holding, the court improperly created a new local rule.  Siguel's claim lacks merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. Sec. 1654 provides that \"[i]n all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel....\"  Siguel admits that he could not find any cases in support of his interpretation of Sec. 1654.  The reason, we think, is plain.  \"Section 1654 does not itself confer any right to 'hybrid representation.' \"  O'Reilly v. New York Times Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410935\"><a href=\"/opinion/410935/john-t-oreilly-and-contemporary-mission-inc-v-the-new-york-times/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span>, 868 (2d Cir. 1982) (to claim the right to self-representation, a party must \"clearly and unequivocally discharge any lawyer\").  Thus, the district court's denial of Siguel's request to employ a lawyer to aid him was not in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>F.

Siguel sought sanctions for Allstate's alleged (1) failure to comply with deadlines for filing pleadings and responding to discovery requests, (2) failure to prepare a joint stipulation concerning procedures for the taking of depositions in Argentina, (3) failure to file a joint statement of undisputed facts, (4) failure to prepare a list of documents it considered privileged, and (5) failure to serve subpoenas in compliance with Fed.  R. Civ. P. 45.  Siguel also claims that the district court erred in granting an extension of time to Allstate to file its answer to an amended complaint;  Siguel asserts that the court granted this motion on the mistaken assumption that Siguel had not filed an opposition to an extension of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have reviewed the record and the parties' briefs and cannot find that the district court abused the broad discretion it has in these areas.
