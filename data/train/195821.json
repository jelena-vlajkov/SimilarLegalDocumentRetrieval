Pro  se  plaintiff-appellant  Bruce\r                                 \n\nMoore,  a  prison  inmate,  has appealed  from  the  district\n\ncourt's  grant of  summary judgment  in favor  of defendants-\n\nappellees  Peter Pepe,  the  Superintendent  at  MCI-Norfolk,\n\nPhilip  Poirier,   Michael  Little,  and  James  Giblin,  all\n\nofficials at MCI-Norfolk.\n\n                      Background\r                                            \n\n     The  facts  that  are undisputed  are  as  follows.   In\n\nFebruary  1991, Moore was  implicated in a  scheme to falsely\n\ninculpate other inmates by  placing contraband items, such as\n\nhomemade  knives  and  banned  substances,  in  their  cells.\n\nConsequently, on March 5, 1991, Moore was placed on \"awaiting\n\naction\" (\"AA\") status in the  administrative segregation unit\n\nin the Receiving Building (\"RB\").  \n\n     On  March  15,  Moore  received  a  disciplinary  report\n\ncharging  him  with   a  number  of   disciplinary  offenses,\n\nincluding,  among other  things, conduct  which  disrupted or\n\ninterfered  with  the  security  or orderly  running  of  the\n\ninstitution;   possession  or   introduction  of   a  weapon,\n\nsharpened  instrument,  knife, or  tool;  and  aiding another\n\nperson to commit the other charged offenses.  On   March  26,\n\n1991,  a disciplinary  hearing  was held.   At  that hearing,\n\nMoore  admitted that he knew  that another inmate was putting\r\r\n\ncontraband in other inmates' cells, and that Moore had helped\n\nthis other inmate type a note falsely inculpating others.  \n\n     The  hearing  officer,  defendant  Little,  found  Moore\n\nguilty of conduct which disrupted the orderly running of  the\n\ninstitution,  and  of  aiding  another  inmate  to  introduce\n\nsharpened    instruments    into   other    inmates'   cells.\n\nAccordingly, the hearing officer sanctioned Moore with thirty\n\ndays of isolation, and recommended that Moore be reclassified\n\nto  higher  security.    Moore  then  appealed  to  defendant\n\nSuperintendent Pepe, who denied the appeal on April 4. \n\n     On April 10, the classification board held a hearing and\n\nrecommended that Moore's request  to stay at MCI-Norfolk, \"in\n\nthe  RB on the RB workforce\", be granted.  The recommendation\n\nwas subsequently  approved.   At Moore's  next classification\n\nhearing,  on June 5, 1991, the  board recommended transfer to\n\nBay  State Correctional Center.   On July 8,  1991, Moore was\n\ntransferred to Southeastern Correctional Center.\n\n     Moore  filed  the instant  suit on  May  28, 1992.   His\n\ncomplaint  sought damages  and  injunctive  relief  under  42\n\nU.S.C.    1983 on  the ground that  his right  to due process\n\nunder  the   fourteenth  amendment   of  the   United  States\n\nConstitution  had   been  violated  in  the   course  of  his\n\ndisciplinary  conviction and  by his  confinement in  the RB.\n\nThe  complaint might  also  be read  to  allege violation  of\n\napplicable Department of Correction regulations. \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     Specifically,  Moore alleged  (1) that  the disciplinary\n\nfinding against  him was  not supported by  adequate reasons;\n\n(2) that certain of the disciplinary charges against him were\n\nvague and overbroad; (3) that before and at the  disciplinary\n\nhearing, he  was denied access  to the evidence  against him,\n\ndespite making several requests for such access; (4) that his\n\nrights were violated by his being ordered into isolation, and\n\n(5)  that his  rights  were violated  by  his being  kept  in\n\nadministrative segregation,  i.e.,  on AA  status, without  a\n\nconditional  release  date   from  segregation  and   without\n\nconditions of behavior to obtain release from segregation.\n\n     On  January  20,  1994,   the  district  court   granted\n\ndefendants' motion  for summary judgment.  In  a brief order,\n\nthe district court ruled,  \"Plaintiff failed to timely appeal\n\nhis disciplinary conviction.   In  addition, plaintiff's  due\n\nprocess  arguments are inapplicable  to his  claims regarding\n\nalleged  errors  in  the  disciplinary   process\"  (citations\n\nomitted).  Moore appeals.  We affirm.\n\n                     The Merits\r                                           \n\n     We have held that  where a prison inmate faces  the risk\n\nof isolation time as  a result of a disciplinary  charge, the\n\ninmate has a liberty interest under the due process clause in\n\nthe disposition of that charge.  Smith v. Massachusetts Dep't\r                                                                         \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof  Correction,  936 F.2d  1390,  1399 (1st  Cir.  1991); see\r                                                                         \n\nO'Malley  v. Sheriff of Worcester County, 415 Mass. 132, 139,\r                                                    \n\n612 N.E.2d 641, 647 (1993).  Accordingly, Moore, who received\n\na disciplinary sanction  of thirty days  in isolation, had  a\n\nliberty interest in the disciplinary proceeding.\n\n     The  Supreme  Court  has specifically  spelled  out  the\n\nminimum   procedural  safeguards  necessary  to  satisfy  the\n\nrequirements  of  due   process  in  a  prison   disciplinary\n\nproceeding that may result in the loss of a liberty interest.\n\nThe inmate must  receive \"(1) advance  written notice of  the\n\ndisciplinary charges;  (2)  an opportunity,  when  consistent\n\nwith  institutional safety  and correctional  goals,  to call\n\nwitnesses and  present documentary  evidence in  his defense;\n\nand (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence\n\nrelied  on  and the  reasons  for  the disciplinary  action.\"\n\nSuperintendent  v. Hill,  472  U.S. 445,  454 (1985)  (citing\r                                   \n\nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-67 (1974)).\r                              \n\n     Statement of  evidence and reasons.   Moore alleged that\r                                                   \n\nthe  hearing officer's  written  statement  of  the  evidence\n\nrelied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action was not\n\nadequate. We find this allegation meritless.  The factfinder,\n\ndefendant Little, stated  in writing,  \"The inmate  testified\n\nthat  he  was  aware  that another  inmate  was  deliberately\n\nplacing contraband items such as sharpened instruments in the\n\ncells  of inmates.  He  further admitted that  he helped this\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ninmate finish  typing a  note pertaining to  the contraband's\n\nlocation.\"   There  can be  no doubt  that this  statement of\n\nevidence and reasons was constitutionally adequate.  \n\n     Insofar  as Moore  may  have intended  to challenge  the\n\nsufficiency of the  evidence against him, there  need only be\n\n\"some evidence\"  of guilt in  the record of  the disciplinary\n\nhearing to  support a disciplinary conviction.   Hill, supra,\r                                                                        \n\n472  U.S. at 454-57.  Moore's own admissions easily meet that\n\ntest.     Moore objects  that  he denied  any involvement  in\n\nmaking  sharpened instruments  or  actually placing  them  in\n\nother  inmates' cells.   The disciplinary  findings, however,\n\nsuggest that  the hearing  officer credited that  denial, but\n\nnonetheless found  that Moore, by admittedly  helping to type\n\nthe  falsely  inculpatory note,  aided  another  inmate in  a\n\nscheme  which  involved   placing  sharpened  instruments  in\n\nothers' cells.\n\n     Moore did  assert  in the  district  court that  he  was\n\nphysically  coerced into  helping the  other inmate  type the\n\nnote.    However,  in   an  affidavit,  Moore  described  his\n\ntestimony before the hearing officeron this point as follows:\n\n\"Gaziano  [the other  inmate] insisted  I finish  his typing,\n\nGaziano  placed a  hand on  me and  directed me  to the  seat\n\nbehind the typewriter Gaziano was  using; I read what Gaziano\n\nhad typed and typed  less than 2 complete lines  that Gaziano\n\ndictated to me . . . .\"  Moore has nowhere explained why such\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nseemingly  mild  conduct on  the  part of  Gaziano  should be\n\nthought to have constituted physical coercion.  \n\n     Thus,  the  hearing   officer's  implicit  finding  that\n\nMoore's  conduct was  voluntary appears  entirely reasonable.\n\nThat finding was obviously not so baseless or arbitrary as to\n\nbe constitutionally infirm. \n\n     Vagueness.  Similarly lacking  in merit is Moore's claim\r                          \n\nthat some of the disciplinary charges against  him were vague\n\nand overbroad.  Our review of the charges  on which Moore was\n\nconvicted finds no  such deficiency.   The  only such  charge\n\nwhich  could even arguably be thought vague was the charge of\n\n\"conduct which  disrupt[ed] or interfere[d] with the security\n\nor  orderly   running  of  the  institution.\"     Moore  must\n\nreasonably have  been on  notice, however, that  the specific\n\nconduct  he admitted engaging in --  aiding another inmate to\n\ntype a  note falsely  inculpating other  inmates -- would  be\n\ndisruptive and  would come under  this disciplinary standard.\n\nSee  El-Amin v.  Tirey,  817 F.Supp.  694, 701-03  (W.D.Tenn.\r                                  \n\n1993), aff'd, 35  F.3d 565  (6th Cir. 1994).   In any  event,\r                        \n\nMoore  did not press  this point in his  brief on appeal, and\n\nhas thereby waived it.\n\n     Pre-hearing discovery.  Moore next alleged that prior to\r                                      \n\nthe hearing,  he was denied  access to evidence  against him.\n\nIn  his complaint, Moore asserted  that on or  about March 15\n\nand March 20, 1991, he wrote two letters to defendant Pepe in\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nwhich he \"requested he be supplied  with all alleged tangible\n\nand  material  evidence  in  photographic  form, or  detailed\n\nwritten    description/report(s),    or   any    informant(s)\n\ninformation,  with  applicable names  deleted,  or laboratory\n\nanalysis  report(s).\"   Moore  alleged  that  he received  no\n\nresponse.   Moore  further  alleged that  he  made a  similar\n\nrequest of the hearing  officer, who allegedly responded that\n\nhe  was  not in  possession of  any  objects or  documents in\n\nevidence  against  Moore,  but  was  relying  solely  on  the\n\ndisciplinary report.\n\n     Hill,  supra, 472 U.S.  445, and Wolff,  supra, 418 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n539,   do  not   specifically  recognize   any   due  process\n\nentitlement to  pre-hearing discovery.  In  Smith, supra, 936\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  1390, however, we held, \"While Wolff does not accord an\r                                                      \n\ninmate  a [due  process] right  to pre-hearing  discovery, we\n\nthink that .  . . when an inmate seeks relevant and important\n\ndocuments central to the construction  of a defense, and  his\n\nrequests are repeatedly denied, an explanation of the reasons\n\nfor  the denial should be furnished.\"   Id. at 1401.  We went\r                                                       \n\non to  note that the denial of discovery did not \"r[i]se to a\n\nlevel of constitutional magnitude\"  where the requested items\n\ndid  not appear  central to the  inmate's defense,  and where\n\ndefendant's  \"brief  on appeal  is  bereft  of any  developed\n\nargumentation to the contrary.\"  Id. at 1401 n.18.\r                                               \n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\n     Moore has  supplied no argument, either  to the district\n\ncourt or  to  this  court,  why  pre-hearing  access  to  the\n\nevidence  against  him  should  be  thought  central  to  the\n\nconstruction of a  defense.  The  importance of such  access,\n\nmoreover,  is far from evident.  To the contrary, the hearing\n\nofficer based his ruling on Moore's admission that  he helped\n\nanother  inmate  type  a  note intended  to  inculpate  other\n\ninmates.  In a March 20, 1991 letter to defendant Pepe, Moore\n\nmade the same admission.   It is hard, therefore, to see  how\n\nthe denial of discovery prejudiced Moore's defense to charges\n\nthat he admitted.  \n\n     Moore  did  argue in  the  district  court that  he  was\n\nphysically  coerced into helping type  the note.   As we have\n\nsaid, however,  Moore's own  account of his  testimony before\n\nthe hearing  officer suggests that  this was a  weak defense.\n\nIn any event, it  is unclear how access to  physical evidence\n\nwould have bolstered it.   For all these reasons, we  find no\n\ndue  process violation  in  the denial  of Moore's  discovery\n\nrequest without explanation.\n\n     Isolation.   Given the lack of any due process defect in\r                          \n\nMoore's  disciplinary proceeding,  there  is no  basis for  a\n\nfinding that  his constitutional rights were  violated by his\n\nplacement in isolation.\n\n     Placement on  AA status in the RB.  We further find that\r                                                  \n\nMoore's placement on  AA status  in the RB  -- first  pending\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\ninvestigation  and resolution  of  the  disciplinary  charges\n\nagainst him, and then pending transfer or reclassification --\n\ndid not violate due process.  \n\n     The Supreme Court has ruled that the due process clause,\n\nin and of itself, does not confer upon a prisoner any liberty\n\ninterest  in being  held  in the  general prison  population.\n\nHewitt v. Helms, 459  U.S. 460, 467-68  (1983).  To be  sure,\r                           \n\nstate  laws or  regulations  may create  a protected  liberty\n\ninterest if, by setting forth \"explicitly mandatory language\"\n\nand  \"specified  substantive predicates,\"  Kentucky  Dep't of\r                                                                         \n\nCorrections  v.  Thompson, 490  U.S.  454,  463 (1989),  they\r                                     \n\n\"plac[e]  substantive  limitations  on official  discretion,\"\n\nOlim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 249 (1983).  \r                              \n\n     In  Stokes v.  Fair, 795  F.2d 235  (1st Cir.  1986), we\r                                    \n\nruled  that   the  Massachusetts  Department   of  Correction\n\nregulations which  then governed the placement  of inmates in\n\n\"awaiting  action\" detention  did  create a  liberty interest\n\nprotected by the  due process  clause.  They  did so  because\n\nthey  permitted  prison officials  to place  an inmate  on AA\n\nstatus only  upon the occurrence of  certain conditions, such\n\nas pending investigation or hearing of a disciplinary offense\n\nor  pending  transfer or  reclassification to  higher custody\n\nstatus.  Id.  at 237.   Due process  would therefore  require\r                       \n\nthat  an inmate placed on AA status receive an informal, non-\n\nadversary  review  within  a  reasonable  time,  and  receive\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nsubsequent periodic reviews.  Hewitt, supra, 459 U.S. at 472,\r                                                       \n\n477 n.9.\n\n     In  1987,  long before  the  events  of this  case,  the\n\nrelevant  regulations were  revised, with  mandatory language\n\nreplaced  by   language   conveying  discretion   to   prison\n\nofficials.  The current prison regulations provide that \"[a]t\n\nthe discretion of the Superintendent or his designee, . . . ,\n\nan  inmate   who  is  under  investigation   for  a  possible\n\ndisciplinary offense or has been charged with or found guilty\n\nof a disciplinary offense,  may be placed on  awaiting action\n\nstatus .  . .  .   Such status  may include  more restrictive\n\nconfinement as  deemed appropriate  by the Superintendent  or\n\nhis designee.\"  103 C.M.R.   430.21(1).  The regulations call\n\nfor reviews of  RB placement at least weekly.   Id.   423.13.\n\nDefendants argue that  the current language places  decisions\n\nregarding   confinement  on  AA   status  wholly  within  the\n\ndiscretion of  the Superintendent, and  therefore creates  no\n\nliberty interest.\n\n     We  need not resolve that question.  Even if due process\n\nrequirements  do  apply,  we  would  find  no  constitutional\n\nviolation.   There  is no  dispute that  Moore was  initially\n\nplaced on AA  status in  the RB pending  an investigation  of\n\ndisciplinary charges.  Following his  disciplinary conviction\n\nhe  was kept  there for  a little  over three  months pending\n\ntransfer  or  reclassification.    Thus, he  was  placed  and\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nmaintained  in  the  RB   for  purposes  in  accordance  with\n\napplicable regulations.  During  that period, he received two\n\nclassification board  hearings regarding his  status, as well\n\nas  informal  weekly  reviews,  all that  due  process  would\n\nrequire.  \n\n     In   addition,  Moore   has  not   disputed  defendants'\n\nassertion that at  least some significant portion of his stay\n\nin  the RB was  in accordance with  his own request.   In his\n\nbrief  on appeal,  Moore acknowledges  that at the  April 10,\n\n1991 classification hearing, he  \"requested to remain at MCI-\n\nNorfolk,  even  if  such  classification meant  a  period  of\n\nconfinement to  receive such  favorable classification.\"   In\n\nthe district  court, he  stated  that \"at  this hearing  [he]\n\nrequested  to  remain  in  the general  population  [at  MCI-\n\nNorfolk], even if  it meant an  extended stay in the  R.B. to\n\nallow time for this to be approved.\"  Before his disciplinary\n\nconviction,  in a March  20, 1991  letter to  defendant Pepe,\n\nMoore  also  stated,  \"[I]f  I  am  to  be  punished  for  my\n\nassociation and not coming  forward sooner let the punishment\n\nbe a stay in the  R.B.\"  Although there is a  factual dispute\n\nin  the record  as to  whether Moore  requested or  agreed to\n\nplacement in the RB for the  entire period he was held there,\n\nunder  all the  circumstances we  could find  no due  process\n\nviolation  in  Moore  receiving,  on  a  temporary  basis,  a\n\nclassification status he had specifically requested.\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\n     Finally, Moore's reliance  on Hoffer v. Commissioner  of\r                                                                         \n\nCorrection,  412  Mass.  450,  589  N.E.2d  1231  (1992),  is\r                      \n\nmisplaced.    Hoffer  ruled  that,  given  applicable  prison\r                                \n\nregulations, due  process required  that an inmate  placed in\n\nthe  Departmental  Segregation  Unit   (\"DSU\")  be  given   a\n\nconditional  date  of  release   from  the  DSU,  along  with\n\nconditions  of behavior to obtain such release.  412 Mass. at\n\n455-56;  589 N.E.2d at 1234.   The record  is clear, however,\n\nthat  although  Moore was  placed on  AA  status in  the same\n\nbuilding, the RB, that contains the DSU, Moore was not placed\r                                                                  \n\nin  the DSU.  Cf.  Kenney v. Commissioner  of Correction, 393\r                                                                    \n\nMass. 28,  34, 468  N.E.2d 616,  620 (1984)  (recognizing the\n\nclear  distinction   between  placement  on  AA   status  and\n\nplacement in the DSU).\n\n     In  his brief on appeal,  Moore does assert  that he was\n\nheld in  the DSU.  However,  we do not read  his affidavit in\n\nthe district court  to contain  any such assertion.   In  the\n\naffidavit, Moore  stated that  he was  placed  on the  second\n\nfloor  of the RB, and  it is the  uncontroverted assertion of\n\ndefendant Pepe's affidavit that the DSU is on the first floor\n\nof  the RB, while the second and third floors hold inmates on\n\nAA status.  Hoffer, accordingly, is inapposite.\r                              \n\n     State-law claims.  Insofar as Moore's complaint may have\r                                 \n\nraised  pendent  state-law  claims  of  violation  of  prison\n\nregulations, we  agree with the district  court's ruling that\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nsuch  claims  were  time-barred.   Under  Massachusetts  law,\n\nlawsuits challenging prison discipline must be brought within\n\nthe sixty-day statute of limitations  set forth at Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws c. 249,   4.  McLellan v.

Moore's\n\nfinal administrative appeal  from his disciplinary conviction\n\nwas denied in April  1991, and Moore was transferred  in July\n\n1991.  This lawsuit was not filed until May 1992.\n\n     Violation of local rules.  Finally, there is no merit in\r                                         \n\nMoore's argument  that the  district court erred  in granting\n\ndefendants'  motion for  summary judgment because  the motion\n\nviolated  the district  court's Local  Rule 7.1(A)(2).   This\n\nLocal Rule  requires that  the  parties confer  prior to  the\n\nfiling  of any  motion, and  defendants apparently  sought no\n\nsuch conference with Moore prior to filing their motion.  The\n\nLocal  Rule, however,  became effective  on October  1, 1992,\n\nafter defendants had already  filed their motion on September\n\n25, 1992.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                               \n\n                             -14-\r\r\n",

In February 1991, Moore was implicated in a scheme to falsely inculpate other inmates by placing contraband items, such as homemade knives and banned substances, in their cells.  Consequently, on March 5, 1991, Moore was placed on \"awaiting action\" (\"AA\") status in the administrative segregation unit in the Receiving Building (\"RB\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, Moore received a disciplinary report charging him with a number of disciplinary offenses, including, among other things, conduct which disrupted or interfered with the security or orderly running of the institution;  possession or introduction of a weapon, sharpened instrument, knife, or tool;  and aiding another person to commit the other charged offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 1991, a disciplinary hearing was held.  At that hearing, Moore admitted that he knew that another inmate was putting contraband in other inmates' cells, and that Moore had helped this other inmate type a note falsely inculpating others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing officer, defendant Little, found Moore guilty of conduct which disrupted the orderly running of the institution, and of aiding another inmate to introduce sharpened instruments into other inmates' cells.  Accordingly, the hearing officer sanctioned Moore with thirty days of isolation, and recommended that Moore be reclassified to higher security.  Moore then appealed to defendant Superintendent Pepe, who denied the appeal on April 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 10, the classification board held a hearing and recommended that Moore's request to stay at MCI-Norfolk, \"in the RB on the RB workforce\", be granted.  The recommendation was subsequently approved.  At Moore's next classification hearing, on June 5, 1991, the board recommended transfer to Bay State Correctional Center.  On July 8, 1991, Moore was transferred to Southeastern Correctional Center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore filed the instant suit on May 28, 1992.  His complaint sought damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 on the ground that his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution had been violated in the course of his disciplinary conviction and by his confinement in the RB. The complaint might also be read to allege violation of applicable Department of Correction regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, Moore alleged (1) that the disciplinary finding against him was not supported by adequate reasons;  (2) that certain of the disciplinary charges against him were vague and overbroad;  (3) that before and at the disciplinary hearing, he was denied access to the evidence against him, despite making several requests for such access;  (4) that his rights were violated by his being ordered into isolation, and (5) that his rights were violated by his being kept in administrative segregation, i.e., on AA status, without a conditional release date from segregation and without conditions of behavior to obtain release from segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1994, the district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.  In a brief order, the district court ruled, \"Plaintiff failed to timely appeal his disciplinary conviction.  In addition, plaintiff's due process arguments are inapplicable to his claims regarding alleged errors in the disciplinary process\" (citations omitted).  Moore appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that where a prison inmate faces the risk of isolation time as a result of a disciplinary charge, the inmate has a liberty interest under the due process clause in the disposition of that charge.  Smith v. Massachusetts Dep't of Correction, 936 F.2d 1390, 1399 (1st Cir. 1991);  see O'Malley v. Sheriff of Worcester County, 415 Mass. 132, 139, 612 N.E.2d 641, 647 (1993).  Accordingly, Moore, who received a disciplinary sanction of thirty days in isolation, had a liberty interest in the disciplinary proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has specifically spelled out the minimum procedural safeguards necessary to satisfy the requirements of due process in a prison disciplinary proceeding that may result in the loss of a liberty interest.  The inmate must receive \"(1) advance written notice of the disciplinary charges;  (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense;  and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\"  Superintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985) (citing Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-67 (1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statement of evidence and reasons.  Moore alleged that the hearing officer's written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action was not adequate.  We find this allegation meritless.  The factfinder, defendant Little, stated in writing, \"The inmate testified that he was aware that another inmate was deliberately placing contraband items such as sharpened instruments in the cells of inmates.  He further admitted that he helped this inmate finish typing a note pertaining to the contraband's location.\"  There can be no doubt that this statement of evidence and reasons was constitutionally adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as Moore may have intended to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him, there need only be \"some evidence\" of guilt in the record of the disciplinary hearing to support a disciplinary conviction.  Hill, supra, 472 U.S. at 454-57.  Moore's own admissions easily meet that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore objects that he denied any involvement in making sharpened instruments or actually placing them in other inmates' cells.  The disciplinary findings, however, suggest that the hearing officer credited that denial, but nonetheless found that Moore, by admittedly helping to type the falsely inculpatory note, aided another inmate in a scheme which involved placing sharpened instruments in others' cells.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore did assert in the district court that he was physically coerced into helping the other inmate type the note.  However, in an affidavit, Moore described his testimony before the hearing officer on this point as follows:  \"Gaziano [the other inmate] insisted I finish his typing, Gaziano placed a hand on me and directed me to the seat behind the typewriter Gaziano was using;  I read what Gaziano had typed and typed less than 2 complete lines that Gaziano dictated to me....\"  Moore has nowhere explained why such seemingly mild conduct on the part of Gaziano should be thought to have constituted physical coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the hearing officer's implicit finding that Moore's conduct was voluntary appears entirely reasonable.  That finding was obviously not so baseless or arbitrary as to be constitutionally infirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vagueness. Similarly lacking in merit is Moore's claim that some of the disciplinary charges against him were vague and overbroad.  Our review of the charges on which Moore was convicted finds no such deficiency.  The only such charge which could even arguably be thought vague was the charge of \"conduct which disrupt[ed] or interfere[d] with the security or orderly running of the institution.\"  Moore must reasonably have been on notice, however, that the specific conduct he admitted engaging in-aiding another inmate to type a note falsely inculpating other inmates-would be disruptive and would come under this disciplinary standard.  See El-Amin v. Tirey, 817 F.Supp. 694, 701-03 (W.D.Tenn. 1993), aff'd, 35 F.3d 565 (6th Cir. 1994).  In any event, Moore did not press this point in his brief on appeal, and has thereby waived it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pre-hearing discovery.  Moore next alleged that prior to the hearing, he was denied access to evidence against him.  In his complaint, Moore asserted that on or about March 15 and March 20, 1991, he wrote two letters to defendant Pepe in which he \"requested he be supplied with all alleged tangible and material evidence in photographic form, or detailed written description/report(s), or any informant(s) information, with applicable names deleted, or laboratory analysis report(s).\"  Moore alleged that he received no response.  Moore further alleged that he made a similar request of the hearing officer, who allegedly responded that he was not in possession of any objects or documents in evidence against Moore, but was relying solely on the disciplinary report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hill, supra, 472 U.S. 445, and Wolff, supra, 418 U.S. 539, do not specifically recognize any due process entitlement to pre-hearing discovery.  In Smith, supra, 936 F.2d 1390, however, we held, \"While Wolff does not accord an inmate a [due process] right to pre-hearing discovery, we think that ... when an inmate seeks relevant and important documents central to the construction of a defense, and his requests are repeatedly denied, an explanation of the reasons for the denial should be furnished.\"  Id. at 1401.  We went on to note that the denial of discovery did not \"r[i]se to a level of constitutional magnitude\" where the requested items did not appear central to the inmate's defense, and where defendant's \"brief on appeal is bereft of any developed argumentation to the contrary.\"  Id. at 1401 n.18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore has supplied no argument, either to the district court or to this court, why pre-hearing access to the evidence against him should be thought central to the construction of a defense.  The importance of such access, moreover, is far from evident.  To the contrary, the hearing officer based his ruling on Moore's admission that he helped another inmate type a note intended to inculpate other inmates.  In a March 20, 1991 letter to defendant Pepe, Moore made the same admission.  It is hard, therefore, to see how the denial of discovery prejudiced Moore's defense to charges that he admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore did argue in the district court that he was physically coerced into helping type the note.  As we have said, however, Moore's own account of his testimony before the hearing officer suggests that this was a weak defense.  In any event, it is unclear how access to physical evidence would have bolstered it.  For all these reasons, we find no due process violation in the denial of Moore's discovery request without explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isolation. Given the lack of any due process defect in Moore's disciplinary proceeding, there is no basis for a finding that his constitutional rights were violated by his placement in isolation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placement on AA status in the RB. We further find that Moore's placement on AA status in the RB-first pending investigation and resolution of the disciplinary charges against him, and then pending transfer or reclassification-did not violate due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has ruled that the due process clause, in and of itself, does not confer upon a prisoner any liberty interest in being held in the general prison population.  Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 467-68 (1983).  To be sure, state laws or regulations may create a protected liberty interest if, by setting forth \"explicitly mandatory language\" and \"specified substantive predicates,\" Kentucky Dep't of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 463 (1989), they \"plac[e] substantive limitations on official discretion,\" Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 249 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Stokes v. Fair, 795 F.2d 235 (1st Cir. 1986), we ruled that the Massachusetts Department of Correction regulations which then governed the placement of inmates in \"awaiting action\" detention did create a liberty interest protected by the due process clause.  They did so because they permitted prison officials to place an inmate on AA status only upon the occurrence of certain conditions, such as pending investigation or hearing of a disciplinary offense or pending transfer or reclassification to higher custody status.  Id. at 237.  Due process would therefore require that an inmate placed on AA status receive an informal, non-adversary review within a reasonable time, and receive subsequent periodic reviews.  Hewitt, supra, 459 U.S. at 472, 477 n.9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, long before the events of this case, the relevant regulations were revised, with mandatory language replaced by language conveying discretion to prison officials.  The current prison regulations provide that \"[a]t the discretion of the Superintendent or his designee, ..., an inmate who is under investigation for a possible disciplinary offense or has been charged with or found guilty of a disciplinary offense, may be placed on awaiting action status....  Such status may include more restrictive confinement as deemed appropriate by the Superintendent or his designee.\"  103 C.M.R. Sec. 430.21(1).  The regulations call for reviews of RB placement at least weekly.  Id. Sec. 423.13.  Defendants argue that the current language places decisions regarding confinement on AA status wholly within the discretion of the Superintendent, and therefore creates no liberty interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve that question.  Even if due process requirements do apply, we would find no constitutional violation.  There is no dispute that Moore was initially placed on AA status in the RB pending an investigation of disciplinary charges.  Following his disciplinary conviction he was kept there for a little over three months pending transfer or reclassification.  Thus, he was placed and maintained in the RB for purposes in accordance with applicable regulations.  During that period, he received two classification board hearings regarding his status, as well as informal weekly reviews, all that due process would require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Moore has not disputed defendants' assertion that at least some significant portion of his stay in the RB was in accordance with his own request.  In his brief on appeal, Moore acknowledges that at the April 10, 1991 classification hearing, he \"requested to remain at MCI-Norfolk, even if such classification meant a period of confinement to receive such favorable classification.\"  In the district court, he stated that \"at this hearing [he] requested to remain in the general population [at MCI-Norfolk], even if it meant an extended stay in the R.B. to allow time for this to be approved.\"  Before his disciplinary conviction, in a March 20, 1991 letter to defendant Pepe, Moore also stated, \"[I]f I am to be punished for my association and not coming forward sooner let the punishment be a stay in the R.B.\" Although there is a factual dispute in the record as to whether Moore requested or agreed to placement in the RB for the entire period he was held there, under all the circumstances we could find no due process violation in Moore receiving, on a temporary basis, a classification status he had specifically requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Moore's reliance on Hoffer v. Commissioner of Correction, 412 Mass. 450, 589 N.E.2d 1231 (1992), is misplaced.  Hoffer ruled that, given applicable prison regulations, due process required that an inmate placed in the Departmental Segregation Unit (\"DSU\") be given a conditional date of release from the DSU, along with conditions of behavior to obtain such release.  412 Mass. at 455-56;  589 N.E.2d at 1234.  The record is clear, however, that although Moore was placed on AA status in the same building, the RB, that contains the DSU, Moore was not placed in the DSU.  Cf. Kenney v. Commissioner of Correction, 393 Mass. 28, 34, 468 N.E.2d 616, 620 (1984) (recognizing the clear distinction between placement on AA status and placement in the DSU).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief on appeal, Moore does assert that he was held in the DSU.  However, we do not read his affidavit in the district court to contain any such assertion.  In the affidavit, Moore stated that he was placed on the second floor of the RB, and it is the uncontroverted assertion of defendant Pepe's affidavit that the DSU is on the first floor of the RB, while the second and third floors hold inmates on AA status.  Hoffer, accordingly, is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State-law claims.  Insofar as Moore's complaint may have raised pendent state-law claims of violation of prison regulations, we agree with the district court's ruling that such claims were time-barred.  Under Massachusetts law, lawsuits challenging prison discipline must be brought within the sixty-day statute of limitations set forth at Mass.  Gen. Laws c. 249, Sec. 4. McLellan v. Commissioner of Correction, 29 Mass.  App. 933, 934-35, 558 N.E.2d 3, 4 (1990).  Moore's final administrative appeal from his disciplinary conviction was denied in April 1991, and Moore was transferred in July 1991.

Finally, there is no merit in Moore's argument that the district court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment because the motion violated the district court's Local Rule 7.1(A)(2).  This Local Rule requires that the parties confer prior to the filing of any motion, and defendants apparently sought no such conference with Moore prior to filing their motion.

In February 1991, Moore was implicated in a scheme to falsely inculpate other inmates by placing contraband items, such as homemade knives and banned substances, in their cells.  Consequently, on March 5, 1991, Moore was placed on \"awaiting action\" (\"AA\") status in the administrative segregation unit in the Receiving Building (\"RB\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, Moore received a disciplinary report charging him with a number of disciplinary offenses, including, among other things, conduct which disrupted or interfered with the security or orderly running of the institution;  possession or introduction of a weapon, sharpened instrument, knife, or tool;  and aiding another person to commit the other charged offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 1991, a disciplinary hearing was held.  At that hearing, Moore admitted that he knew that another inmate was putting contraband in other inmates' cells, and that Moore had helped this other inmate type a note falsely inculpating others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing officer, defendant Little, found Moore guilty of conduct which disrupted the orderly running of the institution, and of aiding another inmate to introduce sharpened instruments into other inmates' cells.  Accordingly, the hearing officer sanctioned Moore with thirty days of isolation, and recommended that Moore be reclassified to higher security.  Moore then appealed to defendant Superintendent Pepe, who denied the appeal on April 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 10, the classification board held a hearing and recommended that Moore's request to stay at MCI-Norfolk, \"in the RB on the RB workforce\", be granted.  The recommendation was subsequently approved.  At Moore's next classification hearing, on June 5, 1991, the board recommended transfer to Bay State Correctional Center.  On July 8, 1991, Moore was transferred to Southeastern Correctional Center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore filed the instant suit on May 28, 1992.  His complaint sought damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 on the ground that his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution had been violated in the course of his disciplinary conviction and by his confinement in the RB. The complaint might also be read to allege violation of applicable Department of Correction regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, Moore alleged (1) that the disciplinary finding against him was not supported by adequate reasons;  (2) that certain of the disciplinary charges against him were vague and overbroad;  (3) that before and at the disciplinary hearing, he was denied access to the evidence against him, despite making several requests for such access;  (4) that his rights were violated by his being ordered into isolation, and (5) that his rights were violated by his being kept in administrative segregation, i.e., on AA status, without a conditional release date from segregation and without conditions of behavior to obtain release from segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1994, the district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.  In a brief order, the district court ruled, \"Plaintiff failed to timely appeal his disciplinary conviction.  In addition, plaintiff's due process arguments are inapplicable to his claims regarding alleged errors in the disciplinary process\" (citations omitted).  Moore appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that where a prison inmate faces the risk of isolation time as a result of a disciplinary charge, the inmate has a liberty interest under the due process clause in the disposition of that charge.

Accordingly, Moore, who received a disciplinary sanction of thirty days in isolation, had a liberty interest in the disciplinary proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has specifically spelled out the minimum procedural safeguards necessary to satisfy the requirements of due process in a prison disciplinary proceeding that may result in the loss of a liberty interest.  The inmate must receive \"(1) advance written notice of the disciplinary charges;  (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense;  and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\"  Superintendent v.

Moore alleged that the hearing officer's written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action was not adequate.  We find this allegation meritless.  The factfinder, defendant Little, stated in writing, \"The inmate testified that he was aware that another inmate was deliberately placing contraband items such as sharpened instruments in the cells of inmates.  He further admitted that he helped this inmate finish typing a note pertaining to the contraband's location.\"  There can be no doubt that this statement of evidence and reasons was constitutionally adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as Moore may have intended to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him, there need only be \"some evidence\" of guilt in the record of the disciplinary hearing to support a disciplinary conviction.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hill,</span> supra</a></span>, 472 U.S. at 454-57.  Moore's own admissions easily meet that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore objects that he denied any involvement in making sharpened instruments or actually placing them in other inmates' cells.  The disciplinary findings, however, suggest that the hearing officer credited that denial, but nonetheless found that Moore, by admittedly helping to type the falsely inculpatory note, aided another inmate in a scheme which involved placing sharpened instruments in others' cells.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore did assert in the district court that he was physically coerced into helping the other inmate type the note.  However, in an affidavit, Moore described his testimony before the hearing officer on this point as follows:  \"Gaziano [the other inmate] insisted I finish his typing, Gaziano placed a hand on me and directed me to the seat behind the typewriter Gaziano was using;  I read what Gaziano had typed and typed less than 2 complete lines that Gaziano dictated to me....\"  Moore has nowhere explained why such seemingly mild conduct on the part of Gaziano should be thought to have constituted physical coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the hearing officer's implicit finding that Moore's conduct was voluntary appears entirely reasonable.  That finding was obviously not so baseless or arbitrary as to be constitutionally infirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vagueness. Similarly lacking in merit is Moore's claim that some of the disciplinary charges against him were vague and overbroad.  Our review of the charges on which Moore was convicted finds no such deficiency.  The only such charge which could even arguably be thought vague was the charge of \"conduct which disrupt[ed] or interfere[d] with the security or orderly running of the institution.\"  Moore must reasonably have been on notice, however, that the specific conduct he admitted engaging in-aiding another inmate to type a note falsely inculpating other inmates-would be disruptive and would come under this disciplinary standard.  See El-Amin v. Tirey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1459490\"><a href=\"/opinion/1459490/el-amin-v-tirey/\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In any event, Moore did not press this point in his brief on appeal, and has thereby waived it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pre-hearing discovery.  Moore next alleged that prior to the hearing, he was denied access to evidence against him.  In his complaint, Moore asserted that on or about March 15 and March 20, 1991, he wrote two letters to defendant Pepe in which he \"requested he be supplied with all alleged tangible and material evidence in photographic form, or detailed written description/report(s), or any informant(s) information, with applicable names deleted, or laboratory analysis report(s).\"  Moore alleged that he received no response.  Moore further alleged that he made a similar request of the hearing officer, who allegedly responded that he was not in possession of any objects or documents in evidence against Moore, but was relying solely on the disciplinary report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hill,</span> supra</a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span>, and <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wolff,</span> supra</a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span>, do not specifically recognize any due process entitlement to pre-hearing discovery.

The importance of such access, moreover, is far from evident.  To the contrary, the hearing officer based his ruling on Moore's admission that he helped another inmate type a note intended to inculpate other inmates.  In a March 20, 1991 letter to defendant Pepe, Moore made the same admission.  It is hard, therefore, to see how the denial of discovery prejudiced Moore's defense to charges that he admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore did argue in the district court that he was physically coerced into helping type the note.  As we have said, however, Moore's own account of his testimony before the hearing officer suggests that this was a weak defense.  In any event, it is unclear how access to physical evidence would have bolstered it.  For all these reasons, we find no due process violation in the denial of Moore's discovery request without explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isolation.

They did so because they permitted prison officials to place an inmate on AA status only upon the occurrence of certain conditions, such as pending investigation or hearing of a disciplinary offense or pending transfer or reclassification to higher custody status.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"473000\"><a href=\"/opinion/473000/ronald-ax-stokes-v-michael-v-fair/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 237. </a></span> Due process would therefore require that an inmate placed on AA status receive an informal, non-adversary review within a reasonable time, and receive subsequent periodic reviews.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hewitt,</span> supra</a></span>, 459 U.S. at 472, 477 n.9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, long before the events of this case, the relevant regulations were revised, with mandatory language replaced by language conveying discretion to prison officials.  The current prison regulations provide that \"[a]t the discretion of the Superintendent or his designee, ..., an inmate who is under investigation for a possible disciplinary offense or has been charged with or found guilty of a disciplinary offense, may be placed on awaiting action status....  Such status may include more restrictive confinement as deemed appropriate by the Superintendent or his designee.\"  103 C.M.R. Sec. 430.21(1).  The regulations call for reviews of RB placement at least weekly.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Sec. 423.13. </span> Defendants argue that the current language places decisions regarding confinement on AA status wholly within the discretion of the Superintendent, and therefore creates no liberty interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve that question.  Even if due process requirements do apply, we would find no constitutional violation.  There is no dispute that Moore was initially placed on AA status in the RB pending an investigation of disciplinary charges.  Following his disciplinary conviction he was kept there for a little over three months pending transfer or reclassification.  Thus, he was placed and maintained in the RB for purposes in accordance with applicable regulations.  During that period, he received two classification board hearings regarding his status, as well as informal weekly reviews, all that due process would require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Moore has not disputed defendants' assertion that at least some significant portion of his stay in the RB was in accordance with his own request.  In his brief on appeal, Moore acknowledges that at the April 10, 1991 classification hearing, he \"requested to remain at MCI-Norfolk, even if such classification meant a period of confinement to receive such favorable classification.\"  In the district court, he stated that \"at this hearing [he] requested to remain in the general population [at MCI-Norfolk], even if it meant an extended stay in the R.B. to allow time for this to be approved.\"  Before his disciplinary conviction, in a March 20, 1991 letter to defendant Pepe, Moore also stated, \"[I]f I am to be punished for my association and not coming forward sooner let the punishment be a stay in the R.B.\" Although there is a factual dispute in the record as to whether Moore requested or agreed to placement in the RB for the entire period he was held there, under all the circumstances we could find no due process violation in Moore receiving, on a temporary basis, a classification status he had specifically requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Moore's reliance on Hoffer v. Commissioner of Correction, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239873\"><a href=\"/opinion/2239873/hoffer-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239873\"><a href=\"/opinion/2239873/hoffer-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span> </a></span>(1992), is misplaced.  Hoffer ruled that, given applicable prison regulations, due process required that an inmate placed in the Departmental Segregation Unit (\"DSU\") be given a conditional date of release from the DSU, along with conditions of behavior to obtain such <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239873\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">release.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/2239873/hoffer-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> at <span class=\"page\">455-56</span></a></span>;  589 N.E.2d at 1234.  The record is clear, however, that although Moore was placed on AA status in the same building, the RB, that contains the DSU, Moore was not placed in the DSU.  Cf. Kenney v. Commissioner of Correction, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2234278\"><a href=\"/opinion/2234278/kenney-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 34, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2234278\"><a href=\"/opinion/2234278/kenney-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span>, 620 (1984) (recognizing the clear distinction between placement on AA status and placement in the DSU).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief on appeal, Moore does assert that he was held in the DSU.  However, we do not read his affidavit in the district court to contain any such assertion.  In the affidavit, Moore stated that he was placed on the second floor of the RB, and it is the uncontroverted assertion of defendant Pepe's affidavit that the DSU is on the first floor of the RB, while the second and third floors hold inmates on AA status.  Hoffer, accordingly, is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State-law claims.  Insofar as Moore's complaint may have raised pendent state-law claims of violation of prison regulations, we agree with the district court's ruling that such claims were time-barred.  Under Massachusetts law, lawsuits challenging prison discipline must be brought within the sixty-day statute of limitations set forth at Mass.  Gen. Laws c. 249, Sec. 4. McLellan v. Commissioner of Correction, 29 Mass.  App. 933, 934-35, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></span>, 4 (1990).  Moore's final administrative appeal from his disciplinary conviction was denied in April 1991, and Moore was transferred in July 1991.  This lawsuit was not filed until May 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Violation of local rules.  Finally, there is no merit in Moore's argument that the district court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment because the motion violated the district court's Local Rule 7.1(A)(2).  This Local Rule requires that the parties confer prior to the filing of any motion, and defendants apparently sought no such conference with Moore prior to filing their motion.  The Local Rule, however, became effective on October 1, 1992, after defendants had already filed their motion on September 25, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
