This appeal  has its  origin in  a lender\r                            \n\nliability  lawsuit  brought   by  plaintiff-appellant   Jerry\n\nBarrows  against  First  Northern  Cooperative  Bank  in  New\n\nHampshire  state court.  Before  the case came  to trial, the\n\nbank failed and the  Resolution Trust Corporation (\"RTC\") was\n\nappointed as receiver.   The RTC removed the suit  to federal\n\ndistrict court and  moved for summary judgment.  The district\n\ncourt  granted  summary  judgment  on  thirteen  out  of  the\n\nfourteen counts  of the first amended complaint.  Following a\n\ntrial  on  the  merits,  judgment  was entered  in  favor  of\n\nappellant on the  sole remaining count.  Barrows  appeals pro\r                                                                         \n\nse from various interlocutory  rulings of the district court,\r              \n\nincluding the grant of partial summary judgment.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     The history  of this case  is quite complicated,  and we\n\nrecount only those facts necessary to an understanding of our\n\ndecision.   On October 17, 1988, Barrows filed an eight count\n\ncomplaint  against  First Northern  Cooperative  Bank in  New\n\nHampshire state court alleging  breach of contract, breach of\n\nwarranty, tortious interference  with contractual  relations,\n\nand slander.  While  the lawsuit was pending in  state court,\n\nBarrows entered  into bankruptcy and a  trustee was appointed\n\nfor his estate.  Although the trustee expressed his intent to\n\npursue  the action, no formal substitution  of the trustee as\r\r\n\nplaintiff  took place at that time, and the case continued to\n\nbe prosecuted by Barrows.  \n\n     Following  substitution  of  the  RTC for  the  bank  as\n\ndefendant and removal of the case to federal district  court,\n\nthe  RTC  moved  for  a stay  of  court  proceedings  pending\n\nexhaustion  of administrative  remedies.   Barrows moved  for\n\nleave to amend  his complaint.  By order  dated June 7, 1991,\n\nMagistrate  Judge Barry  imposed a  180-day stay  and granted\n\nBarrows  leave   until  July  8,  1991  to  file  an  amended\n\ncomplaint.    On  July  8,  1991, Barrows  filed  an  amended\n\ncomplaint which omitted  his previous allegations  of slander\n\nand breach  of warranty  but added several  counts, including\n\nclaims for  negligence, breach of covenant of  good faith and\n\nfair  dealing, negligent misrepresentation,  and violation of\n\nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations laws.  The\n\namended   complaint   also   added   individual   defendants.\n\nFollowing the expiration of the 180-day period, the RTC filed\n\nan amended answer on December 27, 1991.\n\n     On February  19, 1992,  Magistrate Judge Arenas  ordered\n\nthat  the bankruptcy  trustee  be  substituted as  plaintiff.\n\nOver the next  several months, the action  was dismissed with\n\nrespect to most of  the individual defendants.  On  August 6,\n\n1992, Magistrate Judge Arenas ordered plaintiff to show cause\n\nwithin  fifteen days  why  he should  not recommend  that the\n\naction   be  dismissed  with  respect  to  certain  remaining\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nindividual defendants.   Sometime thereafter, the  bankruptcy\n\ntrustee abandoned the action to Barrows.  Neither the trustee\n\nnor Barrows ever  responded directly to the  show cause order\n\nby  addressing  why   the  action  should   continue  against\n\nremaining  individual   defendants.    On  October  6,  1992,\n\nhowever, Barrows filed a second amended complaint.\n\n     On  April 23, 1993, the  RTC filed a  motion for summary\n\njudgment based on the  first amended complaint.  On  June 11,\n\n1993,  the  district  court   held  a  status  conference  to\n\ndetermine, inter  alia, which complaint  was presently before\r                                  \n\nthe  court.  The court found that the first amended complaint\n\nwas  the operative  complaint,  and that  the second  amended\n\ncomplaint  \"was filed  without court  permission and  without\n\nconsent  of  the parties\"  and,  accordingly,  had \"no  legal\n\neffect pursuant to  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 15(a).\"   On August  19,\n\n1993, the district  court granted summary judgment to the RTC\n\non 13  out of the 14 counts in the first amended complaint on\n\nthe grounds  that Barrows' claims failed to satisfy 12 U.S.C.\n\n  1823(e) and the common law D'Oench doctrine.  On August 26,\r                                                \n\n1993,  Barrows filed a motion to \"alter or amend\" the court's\n\nsummary  judgment  order.    This  motion  was  denied.    On\n\nSeptember  15,  1993, Barrows  filed  a motion  to  enforce a\n\nsettlement  agreement that he  and First Northern Cooperative\n\nBank  had allegedly  entered  into in  January 1991,  shortly\n\nbefore the RTC was appointed as receiver.  The district court\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ndenied this motion as  untimely.  Final judgment  was entered\n\non February 24, 1994.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n\n     We begin  by addressing  some of the  alleged procedural\n\nerrors.  Contrary  to the position taken  by appellant, there\n\nwas  no error  in  substituting the  RTC as  party-defendant.\n\nPursuant to 12  U.S.C.    1441a(b)(4) and 1821(d)(2), the RTC\n\nsucceeded to \"all rights,  titles, powers, and privileges\" of\n\nthe failed bank.    Fed. R. Civ. P.  25(c) gives the district\n\ncourt  discretion  to substitute  a party  \"[i]n case  of any\n\ntransfer of interest.\"  There are many cases in which the RTC\n\nas  receiver is  substituted, as  a matter  of course,  for a\n\nfailed  bank.  See, e.g., RTC v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  1144, 1147  (11th Cir.  1993) (substitution  of RTC  as\n\nplaintiff); Pierce &amp; Assoc.  v. RTC, 987 F.2d 663,  664 (10th\r                                               \n\nCir.  1993)  (substitution of  RTC  as  defendant); Payne  v.\r                                                                     \n\nSecurity  Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n,  924 F.2d 109,  110-11 (7th Cir.\r                                       \n\n1991) (same).    Appellant  has advanced no  plausible ground\n\nwhy the RTC's  motion for  substitution in  the instant  case\n\nshould have been denied or why a hearing was necessary.  \n\n     We also  reject appellant's  argument that  the district\n\ncourt  erred in proceeding with the case after the RTC failed\n\nto make  a determination  of his administrative  claim within\n\n180 days.  The stay order,  by its very terms, granted a stay\n\nof only  180 days.   Upon the  expiration of this  period, on\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nDecember 4, 1991, the district  court appropriately continued\n\nwith the case.  Cf. Marquis v. FDIC, 965 F.2d 1148, 1155 (1st\r                                               \n\nCir.  1992) (contemplating  that once  the FDIC  steps in  as\n\nreceiver, the district  court would in  the vast majority  of\n\ncases  \"hold  pending  litigation   in  abeyance  until   the\n\nadministrative review process has run its course, or 180 days\n\nhas passed, whichever first occurs\").\n\n     We  are also persuaded,  for the  reasons stated  in the\n\ndistrict court's  order dated June  11, 1993, that  the court\n\ndid not err in  finding that the first amended  complaint was\n\nthe operative  complaint.   For  the  first time  on  appeal,\n\nappellant argues that the  first amended complaint, which was\n\nfiled  on his  behalf, could not  be the  operative complaint\n\nbecause  it  was filed  after the  action  had vested  in the\n\nbankruptcy  trustee for the benefit of  the estate but before\n\nthe trustee abandoned  the action.   This argument is  waived\n\nsince it was not raised below.   See United States v. Palmer,\r                                                                        \n\n956 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1992).  Moreover, we note that at the\n\ntime the first amended  complaint was filed, the  trustee had\n\nnot yet been substituted as plaintiff.  Under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n25(c), it was proper, in the absence of such substitution, to\n\ncontinue  the  action  by  Barrows.    See  United  States v.\r                                                                      \n\nTransocean Air Lines, Inc., 356 F.2d 702, 704 (5th Cir. 1966)\r                                      \n\n(adjudication in  bankruptcy of  carrier did not,  of itself,\n\nsubstitute  bankruptcy trustee  as party to  action); Liberty\r                                                                         \n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nBroadcasting  Sys., Inc.  v.  Albertson, 15  F.R.D. 121,  122\r                                                   \n\n(W.D.N.Y.  1953)  (where no  motion  was  made to  substitute\n\nbankruptcy trustee  as plaintiff,  it was proper  to continue\n\nthe action as originally instituted).\n\n                             III.\n\n     We now  turn to  appellant's argument that  the district\n\ncourt  erred  in failing  to  enforce  an alleged  settlement\n\nagreement that appellant and First  Northern Cooperative Bank\n\nentered into  in January  1991, shortly  before  the RTC  was\n\nappointed as receiver.  According to Barrows, the bank agreed\n\nto provide  him  with  various  loans  in  exchange  for  his\n\ndropping the lawsuit.  Following its appointment as receiver,\n\nhowever, the RTC allegedly refused to honor the agreement.\n\n     As an initial  matter, we agree with  the district court\n\nthat the  motion to  enforce settlement agreement,  which was\n\nfiled on September  15, 1993, was untimely.  In so ruling, we\n\ndo  not  rely, as  did the  district court,  in part,  on the\n\ntimely  filing   requirement  of  Fed.  R.   Civ.  P.  59(e).\n\nAppellant's motion to enforce  settlement could not  properly\n\nbe treated as a motion to alter or  amend judgment under Rule\n\n59(e)  because this  rule  applies only  to final  judgments.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Fayetteville Investors  v.  Commercial Builders,\r                                                                         \n\nInc.,  936  F.2d 1462,  1472 (4th  Cir.  1991).   The partial\r                \n\nsummary judgment which appellant sought to set aside  was not\n\na final judgment.   See Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 54.   In our  view,\r                                   \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nappellant's motion to enforce was untimely not because it was\n\nfiled more than ten days after the entry of summary judgment,\n\nbut rather  because it was  filed over  two and a  half years\n\nafter  the date of the  alleged agreement and  after the case\n\nwas over  with respect to  all but appellant's  one remaining\n\nclaim which survived summary judgment.\n\n     Moreover,   the  district   court  was   precluded  from\n\nenforcing  the agreement by  12 U.S.C.    1821(j),  the anti-\n\ninjunction provision of the Financial Institutions Reform and\n\nRecovery Act.  Section 1821(j) provides that:\n\n          Except  as provided  in this  section, no\n          court may take any action,  except at the\n          request  of  the  Board of  Directors  by\n          regulation  or  order,  to   restrain  or\n          affect   the   exercise   of  powers   or\n          functions of  the [RTC] as  a conservator\n          or a receiver.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1821(j).  In refusing to provide appellant with a\n\nloan, the RTC was  acting pursuant to its statutory  power to\n\n\"preserve and conserve the assets and property\" of the failed\n\ninstitution.   See  12  U.S.C.    1821(d)(2)(B).   Under  the\r                              \n\ncircumstances, the district court was without jurisdiction to\n\nenforce  the alleged agreement.   Cf. Volges v.  RTC, 32 F.3d\r                                                                \n\n50,  52 (2d  Cir.  1994) (section  1821(j) deprived  district\n\ncourt of  jurisdiction to enjoin the RTC  from auctioning off\n\nmortgages  owned by failed  depository institution); Lloyd v.\r                                                                      \n\nFDIC, 22 F.3d 335, 336 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that district\r                \n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to  enjoin FDIC from foreclosing on\n\nmortgaged property).\n\n                             IV.\n\n     We next  address appellant's argument that  the district\n\ncourt erred in granting partial summary judgment for the RTC.\n\n\"Summary judgment is appropriate  where the record, viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable  to the nonmoving party, reveals  no\n\ngenuine issue as to  any material fact, and the  moving party\n\nis  entitled to  judgment as  a matter  of law.\"   Commercial\r                                                                         \n\nUnion  Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins.  Co., 7 F.3d 1047, 1050 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir. 1993).   The moving  party bears the  burden of  showing\n\nthat  there is no genuine,  material factual issue.   Snow v.\r                                                                      \n\nHarnischfeger  Corp., 12  F.3d  1154, 1157  (1st Cir.  1993),\r                                \n\ncert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 56 (1994).  However, once the moving\r                        \n\nparty  has  made  a  properly supported  motion  for  summary\n\njudgment, the  adverse party  \"must set forth  specific facts\n\nshowing there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(e); Anderson  v. Liberty  Lobby, Inc., 477  U.S. 242,  250\r                                                    \n\n(1986).    We review  a grant  of  summary judgment  de novo.\r                                                                        \n\nSnow, 12 F.3d at 1157.\r                \n\n     Appellant argues  that  the district  court should  have\n\nrefrained from ruling on  the summary judgment motion because\n\nthe RTC had yet to make a determination on his administrative\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nclaim.  He also argues that a ruling on  the summary judgment\n\nmotion  was  improper  since  he  had  reached  a  settlement\n\nagreement  with the bank.  We pass the question whether these\n\narguments were properly preserved and reject them in light of\n\nour  previous   discussion.    The  district  court  properly\n\nproceeded with  the case once  the 180-day stay  expired, and\n\nthe  court was  without jurisdiction  to enforce  the alleged\n\nsettlement agreement.\n\n     Appellant's sole challenge to the merits of the district\n\ncourt's summary judgment ruling is with respect to Counts I -\n\nIII of the first amended complaint.  In these counts, Barrows\n\nalleged that the bank had  agreed to issue an \"unconditional\"\n\nletter of credit, and that it breached this agreement  (Count\n\n1),  was negligent  (Count 2),  and intentionally  interfered\n\nwith his contractual relationship with a seller (Count 3), by\n\nissuing  a standby  letter  of credit.    In its  motion  for\n\nsummary judgment, the RTC argued that these  claims failed to\n\nsatisfy 12 U.S.C.    1823(e) and the D'Oench doctrine.1   The\r                                                        \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The district court's  summary judgment  order contains  a\nthorough  discussion  of  the   D'Oench  doctrine,  and   its\r                                                   \nstatutory  counterpart, 12  U.S.C.    1823(e).

The  evolved doctrine  bars defenses  and\naffirmative claims against the RTC, following its appointment\nas conservator  or receiver to a failed  institution, as long\nas  those claims arise out  of an unrecorded  agreement.

Before the case came to trial, the bank failed and the Resolution Trust Corporation (\"RTC\") was appointed as receiver.  The RTC removed the suit to federal district court and moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted  summary judgment on thirteen out of the fourteen counts of the first amended complaint.  Following a trial on the merits, judgment was entered in favor of appellant on the sole remaining count.  Barrows appeals pro se from various interlocutory rulings of the district court, including the grant of partial summary judgment.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The history of this case is quite complicated, and we recount only those facts necessary to an understanding of our decision.  On October 17, 1988, Barrows filed an eight count complaint against First Northern Cooperative Bank in New Hampshire state court alleging breach of contract, breach of warranty, tortious interference with contractual relations, and slander.  While the lawsuit was pending in state court, Barrows entered into bankruptcy and a trustee was appointed for his estate.  Although the trustee expressed his intent to pursue the action, no formal substitution of the trustee as plaintiff took place at that time, and the case continued to be prosecuted by Barrows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following substitution of the RTC for the bank as defendant and removal of the case to federal district court, the RTC moved for a stay of court proceedings pending exhaustion of administrative remedies.  Barrows moved for leave to amend his complaint.  By order dated June 7, 1991, Magistrate Judge Barry imposed a 180-day stay and granted Barrows leave until July 8, 1991 to file an amended complaint.  On July 8, 1991, Barrows filed an amended complaint which omitted his previous allegations of slander and breach of warranty but added several counts, including claims for negligence, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations laws.  The amended complaint also added individual defendants.  Following the expiration of the 180-day period, the RTC filed an amended answer on December 27, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 1992, Magistrate Judge Arenas ordered that the bankruptcy trustee be substituted as plaintiff.  Over the next several months, the action was dismissed with respect to most of the individual defendants.  On August 6, 1992, Magistrate Judge Arenas ordered plaintiff to show cause within fifteen days why he should not recommend that the action be dismissed with respect to certain remaining individual defendants.  Sometime thereafter, the bankruptcy trustee abandoned the action to Barrows.  Neither the trustee nor Barrows ever responded directly to the show cause order by addressing why the action should continue against remaining individual defendants.  On October 6, 1992, however, Barrows filed a second amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 23, 1993, the RTC filed a motion for summary judgment based on the first amended complaint.  On June 11, 1993, the district court held a status conference to determine, inter alia, which complaint was presently before the court.  The court found that the first amended complaint was the operative complaint, and that the second amended complaint \"was filed without court permission and without consent of the parties\" and, accordingly, had \"no legal effect pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(a).\"  On August 19, 1993, the district court granted summary judgment to the RTC on 13 out of the 14 counts in the first amended complaint on the grounds that Barrows' claims failed to satisfy 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e) and the common law D'Oench doctrine.  On August 26, 1993, Barrows filed a motion to \"alter or amend\" the court's summary judgment order.  This motion was denied.  On September 15, 1993, Barrows filed a motion to enforce a settlement agreement that he and First Northern Cooperative Bank had allegedly entered into in January 1991, shortly before the RTC was appointed as receiver.  The district court denied this motion as untimely.  Final judgment was entered on February 24, 1994.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by addressing some of the alleged procedural errors.  Contrary to the position taken by appellant, there was no error in substituting the RTC as party-defendant.  Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Secs. 1441a(b)(4) and 1821(d)(2), the RTC succeeded to \"all rights, titles, powers, and privileges\" of the failed bank.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(c) gives the district court discretion to substitute a party \"[i]n case of any transfer of interest.\"  There are many cases in which the RTC as receiver is substituted, as a matter of course, for a failed bank.   See, e.g., RTC v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996 F.2d 1144, 1147 (11th Cir. 1993) (substitution of RTC as plaintiff);   Pierce &amp; Assoc. v. RTC, 987 F.2d 663, 664 (10th Cir. 1993) (substitution of RTC as defendant);   Payne v. Security Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 924 F.2d 109, 110-11 (7th Cir. 1991) (same).  Appellant has advanced no plausible ground why the RTC's motion for substitution in the instant case should have been denied or why a hearing was necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject appellant's argument that the district court erred in proceeding with the case after the RTC failed to make a determination of his administrative claim within 180 days.  The stay order, by its very terms, granted a stay of only 180 days.  Upon the expiration of this period, on December 4, 1991, the district court appropriately continued with the case.   Cf. Marquis v. FDIC, 965 F.2d 1148, 1155 (1st Cir. 1992) (contemplating that once the FDIC steps in as receiver, the district court would in the vast majority of cases \"hold pending litigation in abeyance until the administrative review process has run its course, or 180 days has passed, whichever first occurs\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also persuaded, for the reasons stated in the district court's order dated June 11, 1993, that the court did not err in finding that the first amended complaint was the operative complaint.  For the first time on appeal, appellant argues that the first amended complaint, which was filed on his behalf, could not be the operative complaint because it was filed after the action had vested in the bankruptcy trustee for the benefit of the estate but before the trustee abandoned the action.  This argument is waived since it was not raised below.   See United States v. Palmer, 956 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1992).  Moreover, we note that at the time the first amended complaint was filed, the trustee had not yet been substituted as plaintiff.  Under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 25(c), it was proper, in the absence of such substitution, to continue the action by Barrows.   See United States v. Transocean Air Lines, Inc., 356 F.2d 702, 704 (5th Cir. 1966) (adjudication in bankruptcy of carrier did not, of itself, substitute bankruptcy trustee as party to action);   Liberty Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. Albertson, 15 F.R.D. 121, 122 (W.D.N.Y. 1953) (where no motion was made to substitute bankruptcy trustee as plaintiff, it was proper to continue the action as originally instituted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to appellant's argument that the district court erred in failing to enforce an alleged settlement agreement that appellant and First Northern Cooperative Bank entered into in January 1991, shortly before the RTC was appointed as receiver.  According to Barrows, the bank agreed to provide him with various loans in exchange for his dropping the lawsuit.  Following its appointment as receiver, however, the RTC allegedly refused to honor the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we agree with the district court that the motion to enforce settlement agreement, which was filed on September 15, 1993, was untimely.  In so ruling, we do not rely, as did the district court, in part, on the timely filing requirement of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 59(e).  Appellant's motion to enforce settlement could not properly be treated as a motion to alter or amend judgment under Rule 59(e) because this rule applies only to final judgments.   See, e.g., Fayetteville Investors v. Commercial Builders, Inc., 936 F.2d 1462, 1472 (4th Cir. 1991).  The partial summary judgment which appellant sought to set aside was not a final judgment.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 54.  In our view, appellant's motion to enforce was untimely not because it was filed more than ten days after the entry of summary judgment, but rather because it was filed over two and a half years after the date of the alleged agreement and after the case was over with respect to all but appellant's one remaining claim which survived summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court was precluded from enforcing the agreement by 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(j), the anti-injunction provision of the Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery Act.  Section 1821(j) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Except as provided in this section, no court may take any action, except at the request of the Board of Directors by regulation or order, to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the [RTC] as a conservator or a receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(j).  In refusing to provide appellant with a loan, the RTC was acting pursuant to its statutory power to \"preserve and conserve the assets and property\" of the failed institution.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(2)(B).  Under the circumstances, the district court was without jurisdiction to enforce the alleged agreement.   Cf. Volges v. RTC, 32 F.3d 50, 52 (2d Cir. 1994) (section 1821(j) deprived district court of jurisdiction to enjoin the RTC from auctioning off mortgages owned by failed depository institution);   Lloyd v. FDIC, 22 F.3d 335, 336 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that district court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin FDIC from foreclosing on mortgaged property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next address appellant's argument that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment for the RTC. \"Summary judgment is appropriate where the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., 7 F.3d 1047, 1050 (1st Cir. 1993).  The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine, material factual issue.   Snow v. Harnischfeger Corp., 12 F.3d 1154, 1157 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 56 (1994).  However, once the moving party has made a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the adverse party \"must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e);   Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986).  We review a grant of summary judgment  de novo.  Snow, 12 F.3d at 1157.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court should have refrained from ruling on the summary judgment motion because the RTC had yet to make a determination on his administrative claim.  He also argues that a ruling on the summary judgment motion was improper since he had reached a settlement agreement with the bank.  We pass the question whether these arguments were properly preserved and reject them in light of our previous discussion.  The district court properly proceeded with the case once the 180-day stay expired, and the court was without jurisdiction to enforce the alleged settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's sole challenge to the merits of the district court's summary judgment ruling is with respect to Counts I-III of the first amended complaint.  In these counts, Barrows alleged that the bank had agreed to issue an \"unconditional\" letter of credit, and that it breached this agreement (Count 1), was negligent (Count 2), and intentionally interfered with his contractual relationship with a seller (Count 3), by issuing a standby letter of credit.  In its motion for summary judgment, the RTC argued that these claims failed to satisfy 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e) and the D'Oench doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court agreed, and found, in particular, that appellant had \"failed to show a dispute of material fact exist[ed] concerning whether the letter of credit contract was approved by the Bank's board of directors or loan committee.\"  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that Sec. 1823(e) does not bar his claims in Counts I-III because the alleged agreement related to a bank liability, not an asset.   See Agri Export Coop. v. Universal Sav. Assoc'n, 767 F. Supp. 824, 833 (S.D.Tex. 1991) (observing that a letter of credit is a bank obligation and not an asset).  This argument was not properly preserved in the district court, and, hence, is waived.  Moreover, even if we were to reach the issue, we would affirm the judgment below.  The D'Oench doctrine is in certain respects broader than Sec. 1823(e) and is not constrained by any requirement that the agreement relate to a specific asset.   See Hall v. FDIC, 920 F.2d 334, 339 (6th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1231 (1991);  Winterbrook Realty, Inc. v. FDIC, 820 F. Supp. 27, 30-31 (D.N.H. 1993).  Since there is no evidence that the alleged agreement to issue an \"unconditional\" letter of credit was recorded in bank records, the D'Oench doctrine, independently of Sec. 1823(e), bars appellant's claims arising out of this agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   See Nutro Prods.

The evolved doctrine bars defenses and affirmative claims against the RTC, following its appointment as conservator or receiver to a failed institution, as long as those claims arise out of an unrecorded agreement.   See McCullough v.

Before the case came to trial, the bank failed and the Resolution Trust Corporation (\"RTC\") was appointed as receiver.  The RTC removed the suit to federal district court and moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted  summary judgment on thirteen out of the fourteen counts of the first amended complaint.  Following a trial on the merits, judgment was entered in favor of appellant on the sole remaining count.  Barrows appeals pro se from various interlocutory rulings of the district court, including the grant of partial summary judgment.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The history of this case is quite complicated, and we recount only those facts necessary to an understanding of our decision.  On October 17, 1988, Barrows filed an eight count complaint against First Northern Cooperative Bank in New Hampshire state court alleging breach of contract, breach of warranty, tortious interference with contractual relations, and slander.  While the lawsuit was pending in state court, Barrows entered into bankruptcy and a trustee was appointed for his estate.  Although the trustee expressed his intent to pursue the action, no formal substitution of the trustee as plaintiff took place at that time, and the case continued to be prosecuted by Barrows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following substitution of the RTC for the bank as defendant and removal of the case to federal district court, the RTC moved for a stay of court proceedings pending exhaustion of administrative remedies.  Barrows moved for leave to amend his complaint.  By order dated June 7, 1991, Magistrate Judge Barry imposed a 180-day stay and granted Barrows leave until July 8, 1991 to file an amended complaint.  On July 8, 1991, Barrows filed an amended complaint which omitted his previous allegations of slander and breach of warranty but added several counts, including claims for negligence, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations laws.  The amended complaint also added individual defendants.  Following the expiration of the 180-day period, the RTC filed an amended answer on December 27, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 19, 1992, Magistrate Judge Arenas ordered that the bankruptcy trustee be substituted as plaintiff.  Over the next several months, the action was dismissed with respect to most of the individual defendants.  On August 6, 1992, Magistrate Judge Arenas ordered plaintiff to show cause within fifteen days why he should not recommend that the action be dismissed with respect to certain remaining individual defendants.  Sometime thereafter, the bankruptcy trustee abandoned the action to Barrows.  Neither the trustee nor Barrows ever responded directly to the show cause order by addressing why the action should continue against remaining individual defendants.  On October 6, 1992, however, Barrows filed a second amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 23, 1993, the RTC filed a motion for summary judgment based on the first amended complaint.  On June 11, 1993, the district court held a status conference to determine, inter alia, which complaint was presently before the court.  The court found that the first amended complaint was the operative complaint, and that the second amended complaint \"was filed without court permission and without consent of the parties\" and, accordingly, had \"no legal effect pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(a).\"  On August 19, 1993, the district court granted summary judgment to the RTC on 13 out of the 14 counts in the first amended complaint on the grounds that Barrows' claims failed to satisfy 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e) and the common law D'Oench doctrine.  On August 26, 1993, Barrows filed a motion to \"alter or amend\" the court's summary judgment order.  This motion was denied.  On September 15, 1993, Barrows filed a motion to enforce a settlement agreement that he and First Northern Cooperative Bank had allegedly entered into in January 1991, shortly before the RTC was appointed as receiver.  The district court denied this motion as untimely.  Final judgment was entered on February 24, 1994.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by addressing some of the alleged procedural errors.  Contrary to the position taken by appellant, there was no error in substituting the RTC as party-defendant.  Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Secs. 1441a(b)(4) and 1821(d)(2), the RTC succeeded to \"all rights, titles, powers, and privileges\" of the failed bank.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(c) gives the district court discretion to substitute a party \"[i]n case of any transfer of interest.\"  There are many cases in which the RTC as receiver is substituted, as a matter of course, for a failed bank.   See, e.g., RTC v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609833\"><a href=\"/opinion/609833/resolution-trust-corporation-an-agency-of-the-usa-plaintiff-counter-cross/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></a></span>, 1147 (11th Cir. 1993) (substitution of RTC as plaintiff);   Pierce &amp; Assoc. v. RTC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601580\"><a href=\"/opinion/601580/bruce-j-pierce-associates-inc-a-nm-corporation-v-resolution-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span>, 664 (10th Cir. 1993) (substitution of RTC as defendant);   Payne v. Security Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554996\"><a href=\"/opinion/554996/ronald-dale-payne-v-security-savings-loan-association-fa/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 110-11 (7th Cir. 1991) (same).  Appellant has advanced no plausible ground why the RTC's motion for substitution in the instant case should have been denied or why a hearing was necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject appellant's argument that the district court erred in proceeding with the case after the RTC failed to make a determination of his administrative claim within 180 days.  The stay order, by its very terms, granted a stay of only 180 days.  Upon the expiration of this period, on December 4, 1991, the district court appropriately continued with the case.   Cf. Marquis v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584142\"><a href=\"/opinion/584142/serge-marquis-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-liquidating/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1155 (1st Cir. 1992) (contemplating that once the FDIC steps in as receiver, the district court would in the vast majority of cases \"hold pending litigation in abeyance until the administrative review process has run its course, or 180 days has passed, whichever first occurs\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also persuaded, for the reasons stated in the district court's order dated June 11, 1993, that the court did not err in finding that the first amended complaint was the operative complaint.  For the first time on appeal, appellant argues that the first amended complaint, which was filed on his behalf, could not be the operative complaint because it was filed after the action had vested in the bankruptcy trustee for the benefit of the estate but before the trustee abandoned the action.  This argument is waived since it was not raised below.   See United States v. Palmer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577194\"><a href=\"/opinion/577194/united-states-v-ann-m-palmer-philip-f-mulvey-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 1992).  Moreover, we note that at the time the first amended complaint was filed, the trustee had not yet been substituted as plaintiff.  Under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 25(c), it was proper, in the absence of such substitution, to continue the action by Barrows.   See United States v. Transocean Air Lines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"270737\"><a href=\"/opinion/270737/united-states-v-transocean-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span>, 704 (5th Cir. 1966) (adjudication in bankruptcy of carrier did not, of itself, substitute bankruptcy trustee as party to action);   Liberty Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. Albertson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></span>, 122 (W.D.N.Y. 1953) (where no motion was made to substitute bankruptcy trustee as plaintiff, it was proper to continue the action as originally instituted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to appellant's argument that the district court erred in failing to enforce an alleged settlement agreement that appellant and First Northern Cooperative Bank entered into in January 1991, shortly before the RTC was appointed as receiver.  According to Barrows, the bank agreed to provide him with various loans in exchange for his dropping the lawsuit.  Following its appointment as receiver, however, the RTC allegedly refused to honor the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we agree with the district court that the motion to enforce settlement agreement, which was filed on September 15, 1993, was untimely.  In so ruling, we do not rely, as did the district court, in part, on the timely filing requirement of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 59(e).  Appellant's motion to enforce settlement could not properly be treated as a motion to alter or amend judgment under Rule 59(e) because this rule applies only to final judgments.   See, e.g., Fayetteville Investors v. Commercial Builders, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563780\"><a href=\"/opinion/563780/fayetteville-investors-v-commercial-builders-incorporated-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1462</span></a></span>, 1472 (4th Cir. 1991).  The partial summary judgment which appellant sought to set aside was not a final judgment.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 54.  In our view, appellant's motion to enforce was untimely not because it was filed more than ten days after the entry of summary judgment, but rather because it was filed over two and a half years after the date of the alleged agreement and after the case was over with respect to all but appellant's one remaining claim which survived summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court was precluded from enforcing the agreement by 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(j), the anti-injunction provision of the Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery Act.  Section 1821(j) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Except as provided in this section, no court may take any action, except at the request of the Board of Directors by regulation or order, to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the [RTC] as a conservator or a receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(j).  In refusing to provide appellant with a loan, the RTC was acting pursuant to its statutory power to \"preserve and conserve the assets and property\" of the failed institution.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(2)(B).  Under the circumstances, the district court was without jurisdiction to enforce the alleged agreement.   Cf. Volges v. RTC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676069\"><a href=\"/opinion/676069/attila-volges-v-resolution-trust-corporation-in-re-resolution-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 52 (2d Cir. 1994) (section 1821(j) deprived district court of jurisdiction to enjoin the RTC from auctioning off mortgages owned by failed depository institution);   Lloyd v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span>, 336 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that district court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin FDIC from foreclosing on mortgaged property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next address appellant's argument that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment for the RTC. \"Summary judgment is appropriate where the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655503\"><a href=\"/opinion/655503/commercial-union-insurance-co-v-walbrook-insurance-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></a></span>, 1050 (1st Cir. 1993).  The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine, material factual issue.   Snow v. Harnischfeger Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></span>, 1157 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span> </span>(1994).  However, once the moving party has made a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the adverse party \"must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e);   Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 250 (1986).  We review a grant of summary judgment  de novo.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Snow,</span> <span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1157</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court should have refrained from ruling on the summary judgment motion because the RTC had yet to make a determination on his administrative claim.  He also argues that a ruling on the summary judgment motion was improper since he had reached a settlement agreement with the bank.  We pass the question whether these arguments were properly preserved and reject them in light of our previous discussion.  The district court properly proceeded with the case once the 180-day stay expired, and the court was without jurisdiction to enforce the alleged settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's sole challenge to the merits of the district court's summary judgment ruling is with respect to Counts I-III of the first amended complaint.  In these counts, Barrows alleged that the bank had agreed to issue an \"unconditional\" letter of credit, and that it breached this agreement (Count 1), was negligent (Count 2), and intentionally interfered with his contractual relationship with a seller (Count 3), by issuing a standby letter of credit.  In its motion for summary judgment, the RTC argued that these claims failed to satisfy 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e) and the D'Oench doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court agreed, and found, in particular, that appellant had \"failed to show a dispute of material fact exist[ed] concerning whether the letter of credit contract was approved by the Bank's board of directors or loan committee.\"  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that Sec. 1823(e) does not bar his claims in Counts I-III because the alleged agreement related to a bank liability, not an asset.   See Agri Export Coop. v. Universal Sav. Assoc'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1520709\"><a href=\"/opinion/1520709/agri-export-co-op-v-universal-sav-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span>, 833 (S.D.Tex. 1991) (observing that a letter of credit is a bank obligation and not an asset).  This argument was not properly preserved in the district court, and, hence, is waived.  Moreover, even if we were to reach the issue, we would affirm the judgment below.  The D'Oench doctrine is in certain respects broader than Sec. 1823(e) and is not constrained by any requirement that the agreement relate to a specific asset.   See Hall v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></span>, 339 (6th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span> </span>(1991);  Winterbrook Realty, Inc. v.

Since there is no evidence that the alleged agreement to issue an \"unconditional\" letter of credit was recorded in bank records, the D'Oench doctrine, independently of Sec. 1823(e), bars appellant's claims arising out of this agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   See Nutro Prods.

The evolved doctrine bars defenses and affirmative claims against the RTC, following its appointment as conservator or receiver to a failed institution, as long as those claims arise out of an unrecorded agreement.   See McCullough v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601782\"><a href=\"/opinion/601782/david-j-mccullough-and-winifred-m-mccullough-v-federal-deposit-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span>, 874 (1st Cir. 1993) (observing that D'Oench doctrine bars affirmative claims whether cloaked in terms of contract or tort, as long as those claims arise out of an alleged \"secret\" agreement).  Section 1823(e) bars claims or defenses asserted against the RTC based on any agreement \"which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the [RTC] in any asset acquired by it\" from a failed institution unless such agreement:</p>\n        <p>(1) is in writing,</p>\n        <p>(2) was executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the depository institution,</p>\n        <p>(3) was approved by the board of directors of the depository institution or its loan committee, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board or committee, and</p>\n        <p>(4) has been, continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the depository institution.</p>\n        <p>12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Appellant, in an apparent attempt to prove that the alleged agreement was recorded, includes copies of bank records in his reply brief.  Since these records were not filed as exhibits in the district court, they are not part of the record on appeal and cannot inform our decision.  See Fed.  R. App.  P. 10(a).  We note, however, that these records tend to show that the bank agreed to issue a standby letter of credit and not the \"unconditional\" letter of credit appellant claims he was promised</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
