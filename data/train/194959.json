Mark Terison,\n                                                                 \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.  Roland  Villacci appeals from the dismissal\n               \n\nof a  28 U.S.C.   2255 petition challenging the legality of a\n\ncriminal fine.  In  1988, petitioner pled guilty to  a single\n\ncount of  conspiracy to possess more than  fifty kilograms of\n\nmarijuana with intent to distribute.   At sentencing on March\n\n2, 1989,  the district court calculated  under the sentencing\n\nguidelines  (hereinafter  \"guidelines\")  that petitioner  was\n\nsubject to a prison term  ranging from 77 to 96 months  and a\n\nfine  ranging from $7500 to  $1 million.   The court selected\n\nthe  low end  of the  applicable range  in each  instance (77\n\nmonths in prison and a $7500 fine), and also imposed a three-\n\nyear period of supervised release.1  The fine was  to be paid\n\nduring the supervised release  period, with a minimum monthly\n\npayment  of  $100.     Petitioner  filed  no  direct  appeal.\n\nInstead, in September 1992 he brought the instant petition in\n\nan attempt to have the fine  vacated.  Asserting that he  was\n\nand would remain unable  to pay the fine, he argued  that the\n\ncourt  violated 18 U.S.C.    3572 by failing  to consider his\n\nability  to pay (along with other factors), failing to make a\n\nspecific finding with respect thereto, and failing to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing.  \n\n     Contrary to petitioner's  suggestion below,  it was  not\n\nthe government's  burden to  establish his  ability to  pay a\n\n                    \n\n1.  Subsequently, the  prison term  was reduced to  60 months\nand the period of supervised release was vacated.\n\nfine;  rather, it was his burden to establish an inability to\n\ndo so.  See, e.g., United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 620\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (\"[U]nder the guidelines, a fine is the rule-\n\n-and  it is  the defendant's burden  to demonstrate  that his\n\ncase is an  exception\").2  In addition,  while the sentencing\n\ncourt must consider ability to pay and other relevant factors\n\nin  deciding  whether to  impose a  fine,3  it need  not make\n\nspecific  findings with  respect  thereto.   See, e.g.,  id.;\n                                                            \n\nUnited  States v.  Pilgrim Market  Corp., 944 F.2d  14, 22-23\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1991); see  also United States v.  Wilfred American\n                                                             \n\nEduc.   Corp.,  953   F.2d  717,   719-20  (1st   Cir.  1992)\n             \n\n(interpreting similar  language in predecessor statute).  Nor\n\n                    \n\n2.  The pertinent  guideline provision in effect  at the time\nof petitioner's sentencing makes this plain:\n\n          If  the defendant  establishes that (1)  he is\n                                        \n     not able  and, even  with the use  of a  reasonable\n     installment schedule,  is not likely to become able\n     to  pay all  or part  of the  fine required  by the\n     preceding provisions,  or (2) imposition of  a fine\n     would unduly burden the defendant's dependents, the\n     court may impose a lesser fine or waive the fine.\n\nU.S.S.G.   5E4.2(f) (1988)  (emphasis added).  The applicable\nprovision in the current  guidelines, see U.S.S.G.   5E1.2(a)\n                                         \n(1993), is to the same effect. \n\n3.  Section 3572(a) provides that, in \"determining whether to\nimpose a fine, and  the amount, time for payment,  and method\nof  payment  of a  fine,\"  the court  \"shall\"  consider seven\nenumerated  factors.   These include  the following  two: (1)\n\"the  defendant's  income,  earning  capacity,  and financial\nresources\"; and (2)  \"the burden  that the  fine will  impose\nupon the defendant [and] any other person who  is financially\ndependent on  the defendant.\"  The  guidelines contain nearly\nidentical language.\n\n                             -3-\n\nwill we \"presume that the district court declined to consider\n\nthe relevant ... evidence  contained in the record.\"   Id. at\n                                                          \n\n719.   So  long  as the  record  \"enables adequate  appellate\n\nreview,\" id. at 720, the sentencing court need not  delineate\n            \n\nits reasoning.  \n\n     Under these  standards, we find that  the district court\n\nacted  well within  its  discretion in  imposing the  minimum\n\n$7500 fine.  See,  e.g., Savoie, 985 F.2d at  620 (imposition\n                               \n\nof   fine  under   guidelines  is   reviewed  for   abuse  of\n\ndiscretion).   First,  the  Presentence Report  (PSR)  stated\n\nthat, based  on  defendant's \"personal  financial  statement\"\n\n(which is not in the record  before us), \"he would be able to\n\npay a minimal fine.\"   Defendant voiced no objection  to this\n\nconclusion.4    Second,  petitioner  otherwise  introduced no\n\nevidence concerning his alleged inability to pay.   Third, it\n\nis  apparent that the court did consider this criterion.  Not\n\nonly did the PSR make  reference thereto, but (for  unrelated\n\nreasons) the  court devoted a  substantial amount of  time at\n\nsentencing  to an  examination of  petitioner's  tax returns.\n\nFinally, petitioner overlooks the fact that future ability to\n\npay  is  part  of  the  equation--a  fact  evidenced  by  the\n\n                    \n\n4.  In a reply memorandum  submitted below in connection with\nthe  instant  petition,  petitioner argued  that  his counsel\nrendered ineffective  assistance by  failing to make  such an\nobjection (as well as by subsequently failing to  appeal from\nthe  fine).  This contention has been abandoned by petitioner\non appeal.  \n\n                             -4-\n\nreference  in  both    3572  and the  guidelines  to \"earning\n\ncapacity.\"   As a  33-year-old high school  graduate, in good\n\nhealth, with  no children, and with  previous work experience\n\nas a machine operator and a mechanic, petitioner is hardly in\n\na  position to complain of  any ongoing inability  to pay the\n\nminimum fine in question here.\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                             -5-\n",

Finally, petitioner overlooks the fact that future ability to pay is part of the equation-a fact evidenced by the reference in both &#167; 3572 and the guidelines to \"earning capacity.\"  As a 33-year-old high school graduate, in good health, with no children, and with previous work experience as a machine operator and a mechanic, petitioner is hardly in a position to complain of any ongoing inability to pay the minimum fine in question here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Subsequently, the prison term was reduced to 60 months and the period of supervised release was vacated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The pertinent guideline provision in effect at the time of petitioner's sentencing makes this plain:</p>\n        <p>If the defendant establishes that (1) he is not able and, even with the use of a reasonable installment schedule, is not likely to become able to pay all or part of the fine required by the preceding provisions, or (2) imposition of a fine would unduly burden the defendant's dependents, the court may impose a lesser fine or waive the fine.</p>\n        <p>U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E4.2(f) (1988) (emphasis added).  The applicable provision in the current guidelines, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(a) (1993), is to the same effect.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Section 3572(a) provides that, in \"determining whether to impose a fine, and the amount, time for payment, and method of payment of a fine,\" the court \"shall\" consider seven enumerated factors.  These include the following two:  (1) \"the defendant's income, earning capacity, and financial resources\";  and (2) \"the burden that the fine will impose upon the defendant [and] any other person who is financially dependent on the defendant.\"  The guidelines contain nearly identical language</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In a reply memorandum submitted below in connection with the instant petition, petitioner argued that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to make such an objection (as well as by subsequently failing to appeal from the fine).  This contention has been abandoned by petitioner on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
