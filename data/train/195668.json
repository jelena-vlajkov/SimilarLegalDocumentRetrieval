This  is a petition for  habeas corpus\n                    \n\nby  Kevin Watkins,  hereinafter defendant,  who is  serving a\n\nsentence  for rape  imposed following  his conviction  in the\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court.  The case is properly here, his\n\nstate appeal having  been taken and denied.   Commonwealth v.\n                                                          \n\nWatkins,  33 Mass.  App.  7, review  denied,  413 Mass.  1105\n                                           \n\n(1992).  At the same time, of course, we confine ourselves to\n\nthe case  there  presented, and  presented  below.   Rose  v.\n                                                         \n\nLundy,  455 U.S.  509, 518-19  (1982); Nadworny v.  Fair, 872\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1093, 1096 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          The principal issue  is somewhat unusual,  at least\n\nuntil  recently.    Defendant  and the  victim  were  student\n\nfriends who  engaged in sex, and  then broke up.   Before the\n\nbreak-up, defendant had made a video tape, and thereafter the\n\nvictim  asked for  it.   After  some negotiations,  defendant\n\nagreed to sell it  to her for $10.  She came to his apartment\n\nfor  that purpose  and was,  allegedly, raped,  naturally and\n\n\"unnaturally\" (orally).  Mass.  Gen. L. c. 271,   39.   There\n\nfollowed  two indictments  in  customary  form,1  identically\n\nworded, and  hence failing  to designate the  particular act.\n\nBoth were tried together, without identification; nor did the\n\njury ask.  Defendant did not complain.\n\n                    \n\n1.  Mass.  G. L. c. 277,   79.  See Commonwealth v. Hrycenko,\n                                                            \n417 Mass. 309, 313, 630 N.E.2d 258, 261 (1994).\n\n                             -2-\n\n          This  blindman's bluff  continued,  with  the  jury\n\nfinding defendant not guilty on indictment 89-2834 and guilty\n\non 89-2835.  Defendant did not  ask the court to make inquiry\n\nwhen the jury returned, and the verdicts were recorded, still\n\nblind.   Although it  seems reasonable  to assume,  where the\n\nevidence of the two acts had been introduced chronologically,\n\nthat the  jury  followed  the same  pattern,  we  agree  with\n\ndefendant that  this  is not  inescapably  so.   However,  we\n\ncannot  agree that this means  that the petit  jury could not\n\nknow if \"it was . . . deliberating on the same conduct in the\n\nmind  of the  grand jury  in issuing  the indictments.\"   The\n\ngrand  jury  found  probable  cause for  both  charges,  and,\n\ntherefore, necessarily for the one the petit jury picked.\n\n          Defendant concedes  that he had full  notice of the\n\ncharges, and adequate opportunity to prepare and defend.  \"He\n\nsimply  did not have notice  as to which indictment pertained\n\nto  which  activity.    Ordinarily,  the  indictments  simply\n                                                             \n\ncharging 'rape' would have been sufficient.  But an ambiguity\n                                          \n\narose when the  jury acquitted  on one and  convicted on  the\n\nother.   It was only at this time that the sufficiency of the\n\nindictments   was  called   into  question.\"     (Defendant's\n\nMemorandum  to  district  court;  emphasis   supplied).    No\n\nambiguity \"arose\"  upon the verdicts; if  lack of specificity\n\nbecause of  special circumstance troubled  defendant, he  had\n\nalways   been  free  to  seek  particulars,  Commonwealth  v.\n                                                         \n\n                             -3-\n\nHrycenko, n.1, ante; Mass. R. Crim. P. 13(b)(1).  And how was\n                   \n\nignorance prejudicial?\n\n          Defendant's  complaint  really  comes down  to  his\n\nclaim of inability, in the future, to plead double  jeopardy.\n\nThis claim  is exactly answered by  Hrycenko, which defendant\n                                            \n\ncites.  It is irrelevant if Hrycenko may be bad federal law -\n                                    \n\n-  which  we  would not  think.   As  only  state  crimes are\n\ninvolved,  the  contention is  frivolous;  he  is necessarily\n\nstate protected.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -4-\n",
