Defendant-appellant Jose  Omar Santa\r                                 \r\n\n(\"Santa\") appeals  his sentence  on two grounds.   First,  he\r\n\nobjects to  the conversion  of money  found at  his apartment\r\n\ninto drug amounts  for the purposes  of calculating his  base\r\n\noffense  level.   Second,  he contests  the district  court's\r\n\nrefusal  to depart  downward from  the guideline  sentence on\r\n\naccount of  defendant's status  as a deportable  alien, which\r\n\nmakes him ineligible  for assignment to low-security  prisons\r\n\nor half-way houses.  We affirm.\r\n\n                    I.  Conversion of Cash\r                                                      \r\n\n          The Commentary  to  Section  2D1.1  of  the  United\r\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines provides  that drug amounts  not\r\n\nspecified in the  counts of conviction  may be considered  in\r\n\ndetermining the  offense level.   See Comment  n. 12.   To be\r                                                 \r\n\nincluded, the drug amounts  must be \"part of the  same course\r\n\nof  conduct  or  common scheme  or  plan  as  the offense  of\r\n\nconviction.\"   United States  v. Gerante,  891 F.2d  364, 369\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1989).  The Guidelines permit the sentencing court\r\n\nto treat cash as  the equivalent of an estimated  quantity of\r\n\ndrugs in arriving at a base offense level. Comment note 12 to\r\n\n  2D1.1 provides, in relevant part, as follows:\r\n\n               Where there is no  drug seizure\r\n               or the amount  seized does  not\r\n               reflect   the   scale  of   the\r\n               offense,   the   court    shall\r\n               approximate the quantity of the\r\n               controlled substance. In making\r\n               this  determination,  the court\r\n               may consider,  for example, the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n               price  generally  obtained  for\r\n               the controlled substance, . . .\r\n\n          On appeal,  Santa argues that there  is no evidence\r\n\nto support the government's  statement at sentencing that the\r\n\ncash was wrapped  in tin foil and located under  the bed.  He\r\n\nalso argues that the cash \"represented  the proceeds of sales\r\n\nalready  counted.\"   At  sentencing, however,  Santa did  not\r\n\nobject  to  the government's  account  of  the packaging  and\r\n\nlocation of the cash.   Therefore, this objection may  not be\r\n\nraised for the  first time on  appeal.  See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nJackson, 3 F.3d  506, 511 (1st Cir.  1993).  Even  on appeal,\r                   \r\n\nSanta   has  failed to  offer an  alternative account  of the\r\n\npackaging and location of the cash.  \"[T]he     determination\r\n\nthat  an  amount  of  money  represents  proceeds  from  drug\r\n\ntransactions that are part  of the same course of  conduct as\r\n\nthe  charged  offense,  and  therefore   represents  relevant\r\n\nconduct  attributable  to  the  defendant,  is  predominantly\r\n\nfactual and reviewable only for clear error.\" Jackson, 3 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 510.   In  this case,  the sentencing  judge's conclusions\r\n\nwere not clearly erroneous.  The court was free to disbelieve\r\n\nSanta's claim that the cash represented savings for a trip to\r\n\nColombia.  The packaging and location of the cash belied that\r\n\nclaim.  Similarly, given the almost three-month lapse between\r\n\nthe  previous sales  of drugs  and the  seizure of  cash, the\r\n\nrejection of Santa's claim that the cash represented proceeds\r\n\nfrom the previous sales is not clearly erroneous.  \"The judge\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\npresent  at the sentencing hearing is in the best position to\r\n\ndetermine  the credibility of the witnesses and the source of\r\n\nthe currency, . . .\"  Jackson, 3 F.3d at 512.\r                                         \r\n\n                   II.  Downward Departure\r                                                      \r\n\n          Santa's  second argument  on  appeal  is  that  the\r\n\nsentencing court erred in denying his request for  a downward\r\n\ndeparture  from  the guideline  sentence.    \"It  is  by  now\r\n\naxiomatic that  a criminal defendant cannot  ground an appeal\r\n\non a sentencing court's  discretionary decision not to depart\r\n\nbelow  the guideline  sentencing  range.\"   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nPierro, 32  F.3d 611, 619 (1st  Cir. 1994), cert. denied,    \r                                                                         \r\n\nU.S.    , 115 S.Ct. 919 (1995).  \"Appellate jurisdiction does\r                    \r\n\nattach, however, where the decision not to depart is based on\r\n\nthe sentencing court's assessment of its lack of authority or\r\n\npower  to depart.\"  United  States v. Morrison,  46 F.3d 127,\r                                                          \r\n\n130 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          Although the sentencing court indicated that it was\r\n\nskeptical  about its  authority  to depart  on  the basis  of\r\n\nSanta's status as a  deportable alien, that was not  the sole\r\n\nground for its failure  to depart.  The court  clearly stated\r\n\nthat  \"even if I were permitted to make a downward departure,\r\n\nI wouldn't do  it on this basis.\"  Therefore,  the failure to\r\n\ndepart  was  the  result  of a  discretionary  decision  that\r\n\ndeparture  was not  appropriate,  even if  it was  permitted.\r                                                     \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nAccordingly,  this  court lacks  jurisdiction  to  review the\r\n\nsentencing court's departure decision.\r\n\n          The sentence  is summarily  affirmed.  See  Loc. R.\r                                                                \r\n\n27.1.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

The court clearly stated that \"even if I were permitted to make a downward departure, I wouldn't do it on this basis.\"   Therefore, the failure to depart was the result of a discretionary decision that departure was not appropriate, even if it was permitted.  Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the sentencing court's departure decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence is summarily affirmed.
