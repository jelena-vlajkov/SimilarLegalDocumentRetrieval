Pro  se  appellant  Anthony  Norman\r                                 \r\n\nappeals  from the district  court's Fed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\r\n\ndismissal  of his  civil  rights suit  against various  state\r\n\nofficials.  We affirm.\r\n\n          1.  Violation of Due Process\r                                                  \r\n\n          Norman alleged that defendants violated his federal\r\n\ndue process  rights by  suspending his  visitation privileges\r\n\nfor over six months, without a hearing.  Defendants suspended\r\n\nhis privileges when he  refused to provide a urine  sample to\r\n\nbe tested  for drug use  and was determined  to have used  or\r\n\npossessed  marijuana at the Massachusetts Treatment Center in\r\n\nBridgewater, where he is confined.  Norman  may assert  a due\r\n\nprocess  violation only  if  he  has  a liberty  interest  in\r\n\nremaining free from the restrictions  imposed on him by state\r\n\nofficials.  \r\n\n          In  its  decision,  the  district  court  correctly\r\n\nexplained why Norman had no liberty interest arising directly\r\n\nunder the 14th Amendment  due process clause or based  on the\r\n\nfederal  consent decree in King  v. Greenblatt.   There is no\r                                                          \r\n\nneed  to repeat its analysis here.1  Under law controlling at\r\n\nthe  time it  dismissed this  case, the  district court  also\r\n\ncorrectly determined that Norman had no state-created liberty\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  On  appeal,  Norman argues  that  the  consent decree  in\r\nWilliams v. Lesiak granted him a liberty interest in visiting\r                              \r\nprivileges, but that  decree does not even  address itself to\r\nthe question of visiting privileges at the Treatment Center. \r\r\n\ninterest.   We need not decide whether Norman has a protected\r\n\nliberty interest  under state  law under the  new methodology\r\n\nset forth  in Sandin v. Conner,  -- U.S. --, 115  S. Ct. 2293\r                                          \r\n\n(1995),  because  we  affirm  the court's  decision  on  that\r\n\nquestion on other grounds.  \r\n\n          Norman  sought money  damages for  the alleged  due\r\n\nprocess  violation, declaratory  relief,  and  an  injunction\r\n\nordering   defendants  not   to  enforce   state  regulations\r\n\npermitting the suspension of visiting privileges against him.\r\n\nBut defendants are state  officials, and Norman may  not seek\r\n\nmoney  damages against them in their official capacity.  Will\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Michigan Department  of  State Police,  491  U.S. 58,  71\r                                                     \r\n\n(1989).   Nor  may he  obtain money  damages against  them in\r\n\ntheir  individual capacities  because they  are protected  by\r\n\nqualified  immunity.    At  the   time  defendants  suspended\r\n\nNorman's  visiting  privileges,  Norman  had  no due  process\r\n\nliberty interest in being free from such  a restriction under\r\n\nthen controlling  law.  Thus, defendants had no obligation to\r\n\nprovide  him  with a  hearing.   Because  defendants  did not\r\n\nviolate  any clearly  established constitutional  right, they\r\n\nhave  qualified  immunity.   Febus-Rodriguez  v.  Betancourt-\r                                                                         \r\n\nLebron, 14 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                  \r\n\n          Norman's request  for  injunctive relief  is  moot.\r\n\nThe  record  shows that  his  visiting  privileges have  been\r\n\nrestored, and he does  not assert that any new  suspension is\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nimminent.   Because  Norman  cannot obtain  money damages  or\r\n\ninjunctive relief,  his  request for  declaratory  relief  is\r\n\nmoot, too.  See Browning Debenture Holders' Committee v. DASA\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp., 524  F.2d 811, 817 (2d Cir.  1975) (\"When, as here, an\r                 \r\n\nissue  is rendered moot by plaintiff's failure to specify . .\r\n\n.  operative  relief,  and  the  remedy  sought  is   a  mere\r\n\ndeclaration  of  law   without  implications  for   practical\r\n\nenforcement   upon   the  parties,   the  case   is  properly\r\n\ndismissed.\").\r\n\n          2.  Violation of Federal Consent Decrees\r                                                              \r\n\n          Norman  claims  that  defendants  violated  consent\r\n\ndecrees entered in two federal district court cases, Williams\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Lesiak and King v.  Greenblatt.  We find his  arguments to\r                                             \r\n\nbe without merit.  \r\n\n          DMH officials obviously acted in \"concert\" with DOC\r\n\nin promulgating the substance surveillance abuse  policy with\r\n\nwhich Norman failed to comply.  The policy itself shows that.\r\n\nAlthough  DMH's reviewing authority apparently failed to sign\r\n\nthe  policy, the  policy  was nonetheless  effective.   Thus,\r\n\ndefendants did not  violate the provision cited by  Norman in\r\n\nthe  decree entered  in  Williams.   Furthermore, Norman  has\r                                             \r\n\nwaived,  by failing  to raise  it below,  his claim  that the\r\n\ninitial   suspension  of  his   visiting  privileges  by  the\r\n\nSuperintendent  of  the  Treatment  Center,  a  Department of\r\n\nCorrections   employee,  violated  other  provisions  in  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nWilliams decree.  United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d 1,\r                                                            \r\n\n3  (1st Cir. 1993) (claims  not raised in  the district court\r\n\nare  not   preserved  for  appeal).     In  any   event,  the\r\n\nAdministrator of the Treatment Center reviewed the suspension\r\n\nand essentially affirmed it,  suggesting that the  suspension\r\n\nof privileges took place in full compliance with the decree.\r\n\n          Nor  do  we  think  that  defendants  violated  the\r\n\nprovision cited by Norman  in the decree entered in  the King\r                                                                         \r\n\ncase.  The letters communicating the Superintendent's initial\r\n\ndecision to  suspend Norman's privileges  evinced no punitive\r\n\nintent, but only a  legitimate interest in enforcing security\r\n\nat the Treatment Center.  \r\n\n          3.  State Claim\r                                     \r\n\n          Norman  argues  that  the Superintendent's  initial\r\n\nsuspension of visiting privileges violated a state regulation\r\n\nauthorizing the Administrator of the Treatment Center to deny\r\n\nvisiting  privileges.    But  the  regulation  also   defines\r\n\n\"Administrator\"  to include  \"his/her designee.\"   104  CMR  \r\n\n8.02(6).   Since the  Administrator reviewed and  essentially\r\n\naffirmed   the   Superintendent's   suspension  of   visiting\r\n\nprivileges, we  conclude that the  Superintendent effectively\r\n\nacted  as  the  Administrator's  designee   for  purposes  of\r\n\ninitially determining whether  Norman's misconduct  warranted\r\n\nthat suspension.  \r\n\n          4.  Remaining Claims\r                                          \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          Norman's reply brief  raises claims which were  not\r\n\nraised below  or in his initial brief.  For that reason, they\r\n\nare  deemed waived,  and we  do not  consider them.   Ocasio-\r                                                                         \r\n\nRivera,  supra; Playboy Enterprises v.

Lesiak and King v.  Greenblatt.  We find his  arguments to\r                                             \r\n\nbe without merit.  \r\n\n          DMH officials obviously acted in \"concert\" with DOC\r\n\nin promulgating the substance surveillance abuse  policy with\r\n\nwhich Norman failed to comply.  The policy itself shows that.\r\n\nAlthough  DMH's reviewing authority apparently failed to sign\r\n\nthe  policy, the  policy  was nonetheless  effective.   Thus,\r\n\ndefendants did not  violate the provision cited by  Norman in\r\n\nthe  decree entered  in  Williams.   Furthermore, Norman  has\r                                             \r\n\nwaived,  by failing  to raise  it below,  his claim  that the\r\n\ninitial   suspension  of  his   visiting  privileges  by  the\r\n\nSuperintendent  of  the  Treatment  Center,  a  Department of\r\n\nCorrections   employee,  violated  other  provisions  in  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nWilliams decree.  United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604815\"><a href=\"/opinion/604815/united-states-v-richard-ocasio-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                            \r\n\n3  (1st Cir. 1993) (claims  not raised in  the district court\r\n\nare  not   preserved  for  appeal).     In  any   event,  the\r\n\nAdministrator of the Treatment Center reviewed the suspension\r\n\nand essentially affirmed it,  suggesting that the  suspension\r\n\nof privileges took place in full compliance with the decree.\r\n\n          Nor  do  we  think  that  defendants  violated  the\r\n\nprovision cited by Norman  in the decree entered in  the King\r                                                                         \r\n\ncase.  The letters communicating the Superintendent's initial\r\n\ndecision to  suspend Norman's privileges  evinced no punitive\r\n\nintent, but only a  legitimate interest in enforcing security\r\n\nat the Treatment Center.  \r\n\n          3.  State Claim\r                                     \r\n\n          Norman  argues  that  the Superintendent's  initial\r\n\nsuspension of visiting privileges violated a state regulation\r\n\nauthorizing the Administrator of the Treatment Center to deny\r\n\nvisiting  privileges.    But  the  regulation  also   defines\r\n\n\"Administrator\"  to include  \"his/her designee.\"   104  CMR  \r\n\n8.02(6).   Since the  Administrator reviewed and  essentially\r\n\naffirmed   the   Superintendent's   suspension  of   visiting\r\n\nprivileges, we  conclude that the  Superintendent effectively\r\n\nacted  as  the  Administrator's  designee   for  purposes  of\r\n\ninitially determining whether  Norman's misconduct  warranted\r\n\nthat suspension.  \r\n\n          4.

For that reason, they\r\n\nare  deemed waived,  and we  do not  consider them.
