Before he was convicted for being\r                                     \r\n\nillegally  present in  the United  States  in violation  of 8\r\n\nU.S.C.    1326,  Rafael  Antonio  Cuevas, a  citizen  of  the\r\n\nDominican  Republic, had  three separate encounters  with the\r\n\nRhode Island  criminal justice system.   The primary question\r\n\nin this  sentencing appeal is  whether the disposition  of at\r\n\nleast one of Cuevas' state offenses was a \"conviction\" for an\r\n\n\"aggravated felony\" under  the prior  offense enhancement  of\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    2L1.2(b)(2) (Nov.  1994).   Cuevas says  that the\r\n\nenhancement  does not apply to  him, arguing that  one of the\r\n\noffenses was not a \"conviction\" under state law, and that the\r\n\nothers were not \"aggravated felonies.\"  We hold otherwise, on\r\n\nthe grounds  that the definition of \"conviction\"  is a matter\r\n\nof  federal, not state, law  and that Cuevas'  reading of the\r\n\nterm \"aggravated  felony\" is foreclosed by  a recent decision\r\n\nof  this court.   Cuevas  falls within  the group as  to whom\r\n\nCongress and the Sentencing Commission intended longer prison\r\n\nterms   illegal  aliens previously deported  after aggravated\r\n\nfelony convictions   and so we affirm his sentence.\r\n\n                            Facts\r                                             \r\n\n     Each of the three times that  Cuevas faced charges under\r\n\nthe criminal law in Rhode Island, he submitted a plea of nolo\r                                                                         \r\n\ncontendere, his plea  was accepted, he  was judged guilty  of\r                      \r\n\nthe crime charged, and he was sentenced.  In 1983 he received\r\n\nthree  years  probation  for  breaking and  entering  into  a\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nbuilding in the nighttime  with intent to commit  larceny; in\r\n\n1984 he  was sentenced to a year in prison plus probation for\r\n\npossession  of cocaine; and in  1986 he was  sentenced to two\r\n\nyears probation for possession of cocaine.\r\n\n     Cuevas was deported  in 1989.  He  returned illegally in\r\n\n1990, then was arrested again in 1994 on another Rhode Island\r\n\ncharge of cocaine  possession.  Once  again, he pleaded  nolo\r                                                                         \r\n\nand was sentenced to  probation.  While serving that  term of\r\n\nprobation,  he was  found  in the  United  States by  federal\r\n\nauthorities.   He was subsequently indicted  in federal court\r\n\non a charge of having been found in the United States without\r\n\nobtaining the  consent of the Attorney  General, in violation\r\n\nof  8 U.S.C.   1326.  He  pleaded guilty and was sentenced to\r\n\nfifty-seven  months in  prison under  U.S.S.G.   2L1.2.   His\r\n\nappeal raises two challenges to his sentence.\r\n\n             The \"Aggravated Felony\" Enhancement\r                                                            \r\n\n     As in many sentencing  appeals, the consequences of this\r\n\nappeal to  the defendant  are not  negligible.   The district\r\n\ncourt  imposed a  sentence  of fifty-seven  months.1   Cuevas\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Section   2L1.2   of   the  Guidelines,   which   governs\r\ndefendant's offense of conviction,  sets a base offense level\r\nof 8.   The district  court then added  sixteen levels  under\r\nsubsection (b)(2) and subtracted three  levels for acceptance\r\nof responsibility  under   3E1.1,  producing a total  offense\r\nlevel  of 21.  Charted against a criminal history category of\r\nIV, that  offense level yielded  a sentencing range  of 57-71\r\nmonths;  the district court imposed sentence at the bottom of\r\nthe range.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nsays that he  should serve no  more than twenty-one  months.2\r\n\nHe argues that  the 16-level enhancement he received  under  \r\n\n2L1.2(b)(2)  of the  Guidelines3  for having  previously been\r\n\n\"deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony\" cannot\r\n\nstand, because neither of the two cocaine possession offenses\r\n\nhe  committed prior to his deportation  was a \"conviction for\r\n\nan  aggravated   felony.\"4    He  contends   that  his  first\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  While Cuevas asserts that   2L1.2(b)(2) does not apply to\r\nhim, he concedes  that his BOL of 8 was subject at least to a\r\n4-level increase under   2L1.2(b)(1).  Subtracting two levels\r\nfor  acceptance of responsibility  under   3E1.1(a), he would\r\ncalculate his total offense level to  be 10, corresponding to\r\na sentencing range of 15-21 months, given a  criminal history\r\ncategory of IV.\r\n\n3.  Under that guideline, defendants convicted under 8 U.S.C.\r\n  1326 who previously have  been \"deported after a conviction\r\nfor  an  aggravated  felony\"  are subject  to  a  substantial\r\nincrease in their sentences:\r\n\n    If  the defendant  previously  was deported  after  a\r\n    conviction for an aggravated  felony, increase by  16\r\n    levels.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2L1.2(b)(2)  (Nov. 1994).   Application note  7 to\r\n  2L1.2 provides in relevant part:\r\n\n    \"Aggravated felony,\"  as used  in subsection  (b)(2),\r\n    means   . . .   any   illicit   trafficking  in   any\r\n    controlled  substance  (as  defined   in  21   U.S.C.\r\n      802),  including  any  drug  trafficking  crime  as\r\n    defined  in  18 U.S.C.     924(c)(2);  . . .  or  any\r\n    attempt or conspiracy to  commit any such  act.   The\r\n    term   \"aggravated   felony\"  applies   to   offenses\r\n    described  in   the  previous   sentence  whether  in\r\n    violation of federal or state law . . . .\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2L1.2, comment. (n.7) (Nov. 1994).\r\n\n4.  Defendant also asserts that  his 1983 offense of breaking\r\nand  entering  cannot  be  characterized  as  an  \"aggravated\r\nfelony.\"  As the  government does not contest this  point, we\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nviolation was not itself an \"aggravated felony,\" and that the\r\n\ndisposition of his  second drug offense, to which  he pleaded\r\n\nnolo and for which  he received a sentence of  probation, was\r                \r\n\nnot  a \"conviction\" under Rhode  Island law.   We reject both\r\n\nprongs of Cuevas' challenge.\r\n\nA.   Whether the 1986 Disposition Was a \"Conviction\"\r                                                                \r\n\n     Cuevas assumes  that whether the disposition  in 1986 of\r\n\nhis second  cocaine possession offense is to  be considered a\r\n\n\"conviction\" for  purposes of the  Guidelines is a  matter of\r\n\nRhode Island law.  He posits  that he was not \"convicted\"  of\r\n\nthat offense under  Rhode Island law  and so  it cannot be  a\r\n\nconviction  for  purposes  of  Guidelines    2L1.2.5     This\r\n\nassumption is  unfounded.  In this Circuit and others, courts\r\n\nhave  consistently held that whether a particular disposition\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ntreat it as conceded.\r\n\n5.  He relies  on R.I.  Gen. Laws   12-18-3(a)  (1994), which\r\nprovides:\r\n\n    Whenever  any person  shall be  arraigned before  the\r\n    district court  or superior  court,  and shall  plead\r\n    nolo contendere, and  the court places the person  on\r\n    probation  . . .,  then upon  the  completion  of the\r\n    probationary period,  and absent  a violation of  the\r\n    terms of the probation, the plea and probation  shall\r\n    not  constitute   a  conviction   for  any   purpose.\r\n    Evidence of  a plea of  nolo contendere followed by a\r\n    period of probation, completed  without violation  of\r\n    the terms  of said probation,  may not be  introduced\r\n    in any court  proceeding, except that records may  be\r\n    furnished  to  a  sentencing   court  following   the\r\n    conviction  of an  individual for  a crime  committed\r\n    subsequent to  the successful completion of probation\r\n    on the prior offense.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ncounts  as a \"conviction\" in the context of a federal statute\r\n\nis  a matter  of  federal determination.6   Under  applicable\r\n\nfederal  standards,  Cuevas   was  clearly  \"convicted\"  with\r\n\nrespect to  his 1986  cocaine  possession offense.   As  that\r\n\noffense was an \"aggravated  felony,\" his 1989 deportation was\r\n\n\"after a conviction\" for at least one aggravated  felony, and\r\n\nthe enhancement of   2L1.2(b)(2) was properly applied.\r\n\n     In  Molina v.  INS, 981  F.2d 14  (1st Cir.  1992), this\r                                   \r\n\ncourt  addressed  the  meaning  of  a  statute  limiting  the\r\n\navailability of  amnesty from deportation  to illegal  aliens\r\n\nwho  have \"not  been convicted  of any  felony\" while  in the\r\n\nUnited States.  8 U.S.C.   1255a(a)(4)(B).  The petitioner in\r\n\nthat  case,  an illegal  alien,  admitted that  he  had twice\r\n\npleaded nolo  contendere and  been sentenced to  probation on\r                                    \r\n\nfelony  drug charges under Rhode Island law.  Citing the same\r\n\nprovision of Rhode  Island law upon which Cuevas relies here,\r\n\nsee  R.I. Gen. Laws    12-18-3, the petitioner  argued that a\r               \r\n\nnolo plea to a drug charge followed by a sentence of straight\r                \r\n\nprobation was not treated  as a \"conviction\" under  state law\r\n\nand, therefore, should  not be considered so for  purposes of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  The   particular  guideline   at  issue   here,    2L1.2,\r\nimplements a statutory penalty  enhancement found  within the\r\nimmigration laws.  See  8 U.S.C.   1326(b); United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\nRestrepo-Aguilar,    F.3d    ,    ,  No. 95-1660, slip op. at\r                            \r\n3 n.2 (1st Cir. Jan.  30, 1996).  Thus, our understanding  of\r\nthe  term \"conviction\" is informed both  by the law governing\r\nimmigration  offenses as well as the law under the Guidelines\r\ngoverning the federal sentencing of those offenses.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nfederal  law.  Molina, 981 F.2d at  19.  For the court, Judge\r                                 \r\n\n(now  Justice)  Breyer rejected  this  argument.   The  court\r\n\nspecifically held that  the term \"conviction\" is  a matter of\r\n\nfederal, not  state, definition.  Molina, 981  F.2d at 19-20;\r                                                    \r\n\nsee also  White v.

The court noted that this\r                          \r\n\nCircuit, forty years earlier,  had held that \"the meaning  of\r\n\nthe  word  'convicted' in  the federal  immigration law  is a\r\n\nfederal  question.\"  Id.  at 19-20 (quoting  Pino v.

For  example, the\r\n\nSeventh Circuit  has recently  held, in applying  the penalty\r\n\nenhancement provisions  of the Controlled Substances  Act, 21\r\n\nU.S.C.   841(b)(1)(B),  that  a plea  of  guilty to  a  state\r\n\nfelony   offense  followed  by   a  sentence   of  probation8\r\n\nconstitutes   a  \"prior   conviction,\"   even   though   that\r\n\ndisposition  would  not be  so deemed  under  the law  of the\r\n\nconvicting state.   See United States v.  McAllister, 29 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1180, 1184 (7th Cir.  1994).9  Similarly, in 1983  this court\r\n\nheld  that a defendant who had entered a nolo contendere plea\r                                                                    \r\n\nand was  sentenced to probation  under Rhode  Island law  had\r\n\nbeen  \"convicted\"  of a  crime  for purposes  of  the federal\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  For purposes  of determining whether a  state disposition\r\nis a  \"conviction\" as a  matter of  federal law, there  is no\r\nmeaningful distinction  between a plea of  guilty followed by\r\nprobation  and   a  plea  of  nolo   contendere  followed  by\r                                                           \r\nprobation.

In Dickerson, a defendant who had pleaded guilty\r                                     \r\n\nto  a state offense, served a term of probation, and received\r\n\nan  expungement of  his record  argued that  he had  not been\r\n\n\"convicted\"  of  that offense.    The  Court did  not  agree.\r\n\nObserving that a defendant \"cannot be placed on probation  if\r\n\nthe court does not deem him to be guilty of  a crime,\" id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n113-14,  the Court held that the  meaning of \"conviction\" for\r\n\npurposes of  the federal  gun control  statutes is a  federal\r\n\nmatter:\r\n\n     Whether one has been \"convicted within the language\r\n     of [a  federal] statute[]  is necessarily  . . .  a\r\n     question of  federal, not  state, law, despite  the\r\n     fact that the predicate offense  and its punishment\r\n     are defined by the law of the State.\r\n\nId. at 111-12.\r               \r\n\n     It  is  true, of  course,  that  the particular  outcome\r\n\nreached in Dickerson  under the federal gun  control laws was\r                                \r\n\neffectively  abrogated  by  Congress  in May  1986,  when  it\r\n\namended 18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20) to read as it currently does.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nThat   congressional  action,   however,   reflects   not   a\r\n\ndisagreement with  the  Court's reasoning,  but  merely  that\r\n\nCongress determined that its legislative objectives would  be\r\n\nbetter served by defining  \"conviction\" by reference to state\r\n\nlaw.     See  McAllister,   29  F.3d  at   1184-85  (\"[W]hile\r                                    \r\n\ninterpreting federal  statutes is a question  of federal law,\r\n\nCongress can make the meaning of a statute dependent on state\r\n\nlaw.\").   The  decisions  in Dickerson  and Bustamante  still\r                                                                  \r\n\nstand for the proposition that, absent legislative indication\r\n\nto the contrary, the meaning of  \"conviction\" for purposes of\r\n\na  federal  statutory  scheme   is  to  be  determined  under\r\n\nprevailing federal law.   See   Yanez-Popp v.  INS, 998  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n231, 236  (4th Cir. 1993) (\"[Dickerson] still  stands for the\r                                                  \r\n\ngeneral proposition that federal  law governs the application\r\n\nof Congressional statutes in the absence of a  plain language\r\n\nto the contrary.\"); cf.

Congress'  decision  to\r\n\noverrule the  particular result  reached in  Dickerson simply\r                                                                  \r\n\nreflects a  deliberate choice to define  \"conviction\" as used\r\n\nin a federal gun statute by reference to state law.\r\n\n     Congress has  not made the  same choice with  respect to\r\n\nthe immigration laws.   See  Wilson, 43 F.3d  at 215;  Yanez-\r                                                                         \r\n\nPopp,  998 F.2d at 235; see also  Molina, 981 F.2d at 22 (\"Of\r                                                    \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ncourse, federal  gun control  law is not  federal immigration\r\n\nlaw.\").    Since the  May  1986  enactment  of the  statutory\r\n\namendment to the gun  control laws that effectively abrogated\r\n\nDickerson,  the courts    including this  one, see  White, 17\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at  479; Molina,  981 F.2d  at 19     have continued  to\r                                \r\n\ndefine  \"conviction\" according  to uniform  federal standards\r\n\nfor purposes of  the laws governing immigration offenses.  If\r\n\nCongress had disapproved of these cases, it surely could have\r\n\namended the immigration laws  in the same fashion it  did the\r\n\nfirearms  statute.   That Congress  has chosen  not to  do so\r\n\nreinforces our conclusion that \"conviction\" in the context of\r\n\nthe  laws governing  immigration offenses,  including federal\r\n\nsentencing for  those offenses,  remains a matter  of federal\r\n\ndefinition.\r\n\n     The disposition of Cuevas' 1986 state cocaine possession\r\n\noffense  clearly   falls  within   the  scope  of   the  term\r\n\n\"conviction,\" federally understood.  This  is true both as  a\r\n\nmatter  of Guidelines interpretation and, more broadly, under\r\n\nthe  law   governing  immigration  offenses.    Although  the\r\n\nparticular guideline at issue  here (  2L1.2) does not define\r\n\n\"conviction,\"  the   guideline  that  contains   the  general\r\n\ninstructions  for  assessing a  defendant's  criminal history\r\n\ndoes provide  clear guidance.   See  U.S.S.G.   4A1.2.   That\r                                               \r\n\nguideline specifically provides that the phrase \"'[c]onvicted\r\n\nof an offense'  . . . means that the  guilt of the  defendant\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nhas been established, whether by guilty  plea, trial, or plea\r\n\nof nolo contendere.\"  U.S.S.G.   4A1.2(a)(4) (Nov. 1994).10\r                              \r\n\n     Relying in  part on   4A1.2,  this court held  in United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Here,  the\r                  \r\n\ndefendant's second  offense of  simple possession  of cocaine\r\n\nundoubtedly  qualifies as  a felony  in the  requisite sense.\r\n\nForbes, 16  F.3d  at  1301  (explaining that  a  second  drug\r                  \r\n\npossession offense  is punishable  as a felony  under federal\r\n\nlaw).12   And  cocaine possession  is, of  course, punishable\r\n\nunder the Controlled Substances Act.  See 21 U.S.C.   844(a).\r                                                     \r\n\nThus,  the  offense  falls  within the  definition  of  \"drug\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  The possession offense, which was punishable under Rhode\r\nIsland law by a maximum of three years imprisonment, see R.I.\r                                                                    \r\nGen. Laws   21-28-4.01(C)(1)(a), is also a felony under state\r\nlaw,  see R.I.  Gen.

Thus, regardless whether  the offense would have been\r\npunishable  as  a  felony  under  federal  law,  the  offense\r\nqualifies as a felony for purposes of the definition of \"drug\r\ntrafficking crime.\"   See  Restrepo-Aguilar,    F.3d  at    ,\r                                                       \r\nslip op. at 9.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ntrafficking  crime\" under  18 U.S.C.    924(c)(2), and  is an\r\n\n\"aggravated   felony\"   within   the   meaning   of  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2L1.2(b)(2) and  application note  7.  The  district court,\r\n\ntherefore,  properly increased  the defendant's  base offense\r\n\nlevel by 16 levels.\r\n\nB.   Whether the 1984 Offense Was a \"Felony\"\r                                                        \r\n\n     Even were one to  assume that the disposition of Cuevas'\r\n\n1986 cocaine offense was not a \"conviction,\" his challenge to\r\n\nthe application of   2L1.2(b)(2) would fail, because his 1984\r\n\nconviction  for   cocaine  possession   was  itself   for  an\r\n\n\"aggravated felony.\"   As to his 1984 cocaine offense, Cuevas\r\n\ndoes  not dispute that he was \"convicted.\"  Rather, he argues\r\n\nthat,  while the offense was a felony under Rhode Island law,\r\n\nit  would  have  been punishable  only  as  a misdemeanor  if\r\n\nprosecuted  under federal law,  and therefore could  not be a\r\n\n\"felony,\" nor a \"drug  trafficking crime,\" nor an \"aggravated\r\n\nfelony\" for purposes of    2L1.2(b)(2).  We recently rejected\r\n\nprecisely  this  argument,  however,  in   United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nRestrepo-Aguilar,    F.3d    , No. 95-1660 (1st Cir. Jan. 30,\r                            \r\n\n1996).  Thus, even apart from Cuevas' 1986 cocaine possession\r\n\noffense, the  district  court properly  enhanced  defendant's\r\n\nsentence by 16 levels in view of  his 1984 offense, which was\r\n\nitself an \"aggravated felony\" under   2L1.2(b)(2).\r\n\n            Criminal History Category Computation\r                                                             \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n     Cuevas argues that the district  court erroneously added\r\n\ntwo points  to  his Guidelines  criminal history  computation\r\n\nbased on a  finding that defendant had  committed his federal\r\n\noffense  of conviction  while under  a sentence  of probation\r\n\nimposed by the Rhode Island state court for a 1994 state drug\r\n\noffense.  See U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(d) (Nov. 1994) (\"Add  2 points\r                         \r\n\nif the  defendant committed  the instant offense  while under\r\n\nany criminal justice sentence, including probation . . . .\").\r\n\nDefendant  contends that because  he illegally  reentered the\r\n\nUnited  States  in 1990,  he  could not  have  committed that\r\n\noffense while  under his  1994  state probationary  sentence.\r\n\nThis argument has no more than superficial appeal.\r\n\n     The unambiguous terms of  the statute under which Cuevas\r\n\nwas convicted  establish that a deported  alien who illegally\r\n\nreenters and  remains in the  United States  can violate  the\r\n\nstatute at three  different points in time: when he \"enters,\"\r\n\n\"attempts to enter,\"  or when he  \"is at  any time found  in\"\r\n\nthis  country.  8  U.S.C.   1326(a).   As was said  in United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

The primary question in this sentencing appeal is whether the disposition of at least one of Cuevas' state offenses was a \"conviction\" for an \"aggravated felony\" under the prior offense enhancement of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2) (Nov.1994).   Cuevas says that the enhancement does not apply to him, arguing that one of the offenses was not a \"conviction\" under state law, and that the others were not \"aggravated felonies.\"   We hold otherwise, on the grounds that the definition of \"conviction\" is a matter of federal, not state, law and that Cuevas' reading of the term \"aggravated felony\" is foreclosed by a recent decision of this court.   Cuevas falls within the group as to whom Congress and the Sentencing Commission intended longer prison terms--illegal aliens previously deported after aggravated felony convictions--and so we affirm his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the three times that Cuevas faced charges under the criminal law in Rhode Island, he submitted a plea of nolo contendere, his plea was accepted, he was judged guilty of the crime charged, and he was sentenced.   In 1983 he received three years probation for breaking and entering into a building in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny;  in 1984 he was sentenced to a year in prison plus probation for possession of cocaine;  and in 1986 he was sentenced to two years probation for possession of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cuevas was deported in 1989.   He returned illegally in 1990, then was arrested again in 1994 on another Rhode Island charge of cocaine possession.   Once again, he pleaded nolo and was sentenced to probation.   While serving that term of probation, he was found in the United States by federal authorities.   He was subsequently indicted in federal court on a charge of having been found in the United States without obtaining the consent of the Attorney General, in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326.   He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to fifty-seven months in prison under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2.   His appeal raises two challenges to his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The \"Aggravated Felony\" Enhancement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in many sentencing appeals, the consequences of this appeal to the defendant are not negligible.   The district court imposed a sentence of fifty-seven months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Cuevas says that he should serve no more than twenty-one months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He argues that the 16-level enhancement he received under &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2) of the Guidelines<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> for having previously been \"deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony\" cannot stand, because neither of the two cocaine possession offenses he committed prior to his deportation was a \"conviction for an aggravated felony.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  He contends that his first violation was not itself an \"aggravated felony,\" and that the disposition of his second drug offense, to which he pleaded nolo and for which he received a sentence of probation, was not a \"conviction\" under Rhode Island law.   We reject both prongs of Cuevas' challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>A. Whether the 1986 Disposition Was a \"Conviction\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cuevas assumes that whether the disposition in 1986 of his second cocaine possession offense is to be considered a \"conviction\" for purposes of the Guidelines is a matter of Rhode Island law.   He posits that he was not \"convicted\" of that offense under Rhode Island law and so it cannot be a conviction for purposes of Guidelines &#167; 2L1.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This assumption is unfounded.   In this Circuit and others, courts have consistently held that whether a particular disposition counts as a \"conviction\" in the context of a federal statute is a matter of federal determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Under applicable federal standards, Cuevas was clearly \"convicted\" with respect to his 1986 cocaine possession offense.   As that offense was an \"aggravated felony,\" his 1989 deportation was \"after a conviction\" for at least one aggravated felony, and the enhancement of &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2) was properly applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Molina v. INS, 981 F.2d 14 (1st Cir.1992), this court addressed the meaning of a statute limiting the availability of amnesty from deportation to illegal aliens who have \"not been convicted of any felony\" while in the United States.  8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255a(a)(4)(B).   The petitioner in that case, an illegal alien, admitted that he had twice pleaded nolo contendere and been sentenced to probation on felony drug charges under Rhode Island law.   Citing the same provision of Rhode Island law upon which Cuevas relies here, see R.I.Gen.Laws &#167; 12-18-3, the petitioner argued that a nolo plea to a drug charge followed by a sentence of straight probation was not treated as a \"conviction\" under state law and, therefore, should not be considered so for purposes of federal law.  Molina, 981 F.2d at 19.   For the court, Judge (now Justice) Breyer rejected this argument.   The court specifically held that the term \"conviction\" is a matter of federal, not state, definition.  Molina, 981 F.2d at 19-20;  see also White v. INS, 17 F.3d 475, 479 (1st Cir.1994) (\"As we have held before, federal law defines the term 'conviction' as it is used in the immigration context.\"  (citing Molina, 981 F.2d at 19)).   The court noted that this Circuit, forty years earlier, had held that \"the meaning of the word 'convicted' in the federal immigration law is a federal question.\"  Id. at 19-20 (quoting Pino v.

See also White, 17 F.3d at 479;  Chong v. INS, 890 F.2d 284 (11th Cir.1989) (per curiam);  accord Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211, 215 (5th Cir.)

For example, the Seventh Circuit has recently held, in applying the penalty enhancement provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), that a plea of guilty to a state felony offense followed by a sentence of probation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> constitutes a \"prior conviction,\" even though that disposition would not be so deemed under the law of the convicting state.   See United States v. McAllister, 29 F.3d 1180, 1184 (7th Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Similarly, in 1983 this court held that a defendant who had entered a nolo contendere plea and was sentenced to probation under Rhode Island law had been \"convicted\" of a crime for purposes of the federal felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(h)(1), even though the event did not amount to a \"conviction\" under state law.  United States v. Bustamante, 706 F.2d 13, 14-15 (1st Cir.)  (Breyer, J.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 856, 104 S.Ct. 175, 78 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decisions in Bustamante and, to a lesser degree, in McAllister both were based in part on the Supreme Court's decision in Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983).   In Dickerson, a defendant who had pleaded guilty to a state offense, served a term of probation, and received an expungement of his record argued that he had not been \"convicted\" of that offense.   The Court did not agree.   Observing that a defendant \"cannot be placed on probation if the court does not deem him to be guilty of a crime,\" id. at 113-14, 103 S.Ct. at 992, the Court held that the meaning of \"conviction\" for purposes of the federal gun control statutes is a federal matter:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Whether one has been \"convicted within the language of [a federal] statute[ ] is necessarily ... a question of federal, not state, law, despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 111-12, 103 S.Ct. at 991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, of course, that the particular outcome reached in Dickerson under the federal gun control laws was effectively abrogated by Congress in May 1986, when it amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20) to read as it currently does.   That congressional action, however, reflects not a disagreement with the Court's reasoning, but merely that Congress determined that its legislative objectives would be better served by defining \"conviction\" by reference to state law.   See McAllister, 29 F.3d at 1184-85 (\"[W]hile interpreting federal statutes is a question of federal law, Congress can make the meaning of a statute dependent on state law.\").   The decisions in Dickerson and Bustamante still stand for the proposition that, absent legislative indication to the contrary, the meaning of \"conviction\" for purposes of a federal statutory scheme is to be determined under prevailing federal law.   See Yanez-Popp v. INS, 998 F.2d 231, 236 (4th Cir.1993) (\"[Dickerson ] still stands for the general proposition that federal law governs the application of Congressional statutes in the absence of a plain language to the contrary.\");   cf. McAllister, 29 F.3d at 1185 (treating Dickerson as still authoritative, outside context of gun laws, for principle that guilty plea plus probation equals conviction under federal law).   Congress' decision to overrule the particular result reached in Dickerson simply reflects a deliberate choice to define \"conviction\" as used in a federal gun statute by reference to state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has not made the same choice with respect to the immigration laws.   See Wilson, 43 F.3d at 215;  Yanez-Popp, 998 F.2d at 235;  see also Molina, 981 F.2d at 22 (\"Of course, federal gun control law is not federal immigration law.\").   Since the May 1986 enactment of the statutory amendment to the gun control laws that effectively abrogated Dickerson, the courts--including this one, see White, 17 F.3d at 479;  Molina, 981 F.2d at 19--have continued to define \"conviction\" according to uniform federal standards for purposes of the laws governing immigration offenses.   If Congress had disapproved of these cases, it surely could have amended the immigration laws in the same fashion it did the firearms statute.   That Congress has chosen not to do so reinforces our conclusion that \"conviction\" in the context of the laws governing immigration offenses, including federal sentencing for those offenses, remains a matter of federal definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disposition of Cuevas' 1986 state cocaine possession offense clearly falls within the scope of the term \"conviction,\" federally understood.   This is true both as a matter of Guidelines interpretation and, more broadly, under the law governing immigration offenses.   Although the particular guideline at issue here (&#167; 2L1.2) does not define \"conviction,\" the guideline that contains the general instructions for assessing a defendant's criminal history does provide clear guidance.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2.   That guideline specifically provides that the phrase \" '[c]onvicted of an offense' ... means that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(a)(4) (Nov.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying in part on &#167; 4A1.2, this court held in United States v. Pierce, 60 F.3d 886 (1st Cir.1995), petition for cert. filed (Oct. 19, 1995) (No. 95-6474), that a prior state \"conviction\" is established for Guidelines purposes by \"a guilt-establishing event (such as a plea where a defendant states that he does not wish to contest the charges).\"  Id. at 892 (plea of nolo, even if followed by a withheld adjudication, constitutes a \"conviction\" for federal sentencing purposes);  see also United States v. Jones, 910 F.2d 760, 761 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (same).   Here, there is no dispute that whether or not Cuevas' second cocaine offense could be considered a \"conviction\" under Rhode Island law, he was indeed adjudged guilty of that crime following his nolo plea and was sentenced to probation based on that plea.   Cf. Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 113-14, 103 S.Ct. at 992 (\"[O]ne cannot be placed on probation if the court does not deem him to be guilty of a crime.\").   It seems clear under the Guidelines, then, that Cuevas was \"convicted\" of the 1986 cocaine offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even outside the specific context of the Guidelines, the law is plain that a state's acceptance of a defendant's plea of nolo contendere on a drug charge followed by imposition of a probationary sentence counts as a \"conviction\" for purposes of the statutes relating to immigration offenses.  White, 17 F.3d at 479;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Molina, 981 F.2d at 18;  Ruis-Rubio, 380 F.2d at 29-30.   We conclude that Cuevas was \"convicted\" in 1986 of his second cocaine offense, both within the meaning of the Guidelines and within the broader context of the laws governing immigration offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the disposition of Cuevas' second cocaine offense is recognized to be a conviction, it clearly constitutes an \"aggravated felony\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2).   An \"aggravated felony\" includes any \"drug trafficking crime\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(2).   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2, comment.  (n. 7).   A \"drug trafficking crime\" in turn encompasses, inter alia, any offense that is both (1) a felony and (2) punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. &#167; 801 et seq.).   See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(2);  United States v. Restrepo-Aguilar, 74 F.3d 361, 365 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Forbes, 16 F.3d 1294, 1301 (1st Cir.1994).   Here, the defendant's second offense of simple possession of cocaine undoubtedly qualifies as a felony in the requisite sense.  Forbes, 16 F.3d at 1301 (explaining that a second drug possession offense is punishable as a felony under federal law).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  And cocaine possession is, of course, punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.   See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a).   Thus, the offense falls within the definition of \"drug trafficking crime\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(2), and is an \"aggravated felony\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2) and application note 7.   The district court, therefore, properly increased the defendant's base offense level by 16 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>B.

We recently rejected precisely this argument, however, in United States v. Restrepo-Aguilar, 74 F.3d 361 (1st Cir.1996).   Thus, even apart from Cuevas' 1986 cocaine possession offense, the district court properly enhanced defendant's sentence by 16 levels in view of his 1984 offense, which was itself an \"aggravated felony\" under &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Criminal History Category Computation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cuevas argues that the district court erroneously added two points to his Guidelines criminal history computation based on a finding that defendant had committed his federal offense of conviction while under a sentence of probation imposed by the Rhode Island state court for a 1994 state drug offense.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(d) (Nov.1994) (\"Add 2 points if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation....\").  Defendant contends that because he illegally reentered the United States in 1990, he could not have committed that offense while under his 1994 state probationary sentence.   This argument has no more than superficial appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unambiguous terms of the statute under which Cuevas was convicted establish that a deported alien who illegally reenters and remains in the United States can violate the statute at three different points in time:  when he \"enters,\" \"attempts to enter,\" or when he \"is at any time found in\" this country.  8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a).   As was said in United States v. Rodriguez, 26 F.3d 4 (1st Cir.1994), \"we think it plain that 'enters,' 'attempts to enter' and 'is at any time found in' describe three distinct occasions on which a deported alien can violate Section 1326.\"  Id. at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cuevas was indicted specifically for the offense of being \"found\" in the United States in violation of &#167; 1326(a).   That was the charge to which he pleaded guilty.   Thus, even though defendant illegally reentered the United States in 1990, he committed his &#167; 1326(a) offense in 1995, when he was \"found.\"  Rodriguez, 26 F.3d at 8.   He was unquestionably serving a criminal probationary sentence for his 1994 state drug conviction at that time.

The primary question in this sentencing appeal is whether the disposition of at least one of Cuevas' state offenses was a \"conviction\" for an \"aggravated felony\" under the prior offense enhancement of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2) (Nov.1994).   Cuevas says that the enhancement does not apply to him, arguing that one of the offenses was not a \"conviction\" under state law, and that the others were not \"aggravated felonies.\"   We hold otherwise, on the grounds that the definition of \"conviction\" is a matter of federal, not state, law and that Cuevas' reading of the term \"aggravated felony\" is foreclosed by a recent decision of this court.   Cuevas falls within the group as to whom Congress and the Sentencing Commission intended longer prison terms--illegal aliens previously deported after aggravated felony convictions--and so we affirm his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the three times that Cuevas faced charges under the criminal law in Rhode Island, he submitted a plea of nolo contendere, his plea was accepted, he was judged guilty of the crime charged, and he was sentenced.   In 1983 he received three years probation for breaking and entering into a building in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny;  in 1984 he was sentenced to a year in prison plus probation for possession of cocaine;  and in 1986 he was sentenced to two years probation for possession of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cuevas was deported in 1989.   He returned illegally in 1990, then was arrested again in 1994 on another Rhode Island charge of cocaine possession.   Once again, he pleaded nolo and was sentenced to probation.   While serving that term of probation, he was found in the United States by federal authorities.   He was subsequently indicted in federal court on a charge of having been found in the United States without obtaining the consent of the Attorney General, in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326.   He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to fifty-seven months in prison under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2.

Although the particular guideline at issue here (&#167; 2L1.2) does not define \"conviction,\" the guideline that contains the general instructions for assessing a defendant's criminal history does provide clear guidance.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2.
