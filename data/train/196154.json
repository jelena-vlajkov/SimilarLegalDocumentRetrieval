Petitioner    Rashad   Akeem    Rasheed's\r                            \r\n\napplication for a certificate of probable  cause to appeal is\r\n\ndenied, essentially for  the reasons stated  in the  district\r\n\ncourt's April  14, 1994, memorandum and  order denying habeas\r\n\ncorpus relief under 28 U.S.C.   2254.1  In  agreeing with the\r\n\ndistrict court that  there is no basis  to petitioner's claim\r\n\nof constitutional error, we add the following comments.\r\n\n                              I\r                                          I\r\n\n     Rasheed essentially argues that the district court erred\r\n\nin concluding that his suppression and ineffective assistance\r\n\nclaims are  procedurally  barred.    As  an  initial  matter,\r\n\npetitioner contends  that lack  of  notice of  the  impending\r\n\ndenial of his petition was procedurally improper and deprived\r\n\nhim of  due process.   There  is  no merit  to either  claim.\r\n\nRasheed assumes that the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss was\r\n\ntreated as a motion for summary judgment because the district\r\n\ncourt,  in deciding the motion, relied on two of the exhibits\r\n\nattached to the habeas petition: (1) the 1993 decision of the\r\n\nMassachusetts Appeals  Court upholding Rasheed's  most recent\r\n\nattempt in  state court to secure  postconviction relief, and\r\n\n(2) an excerpt from the transcript of his jury trial in 1975.\r\n\nHowever,  a court  may look  to matters  of public  record in\r\n\nruling on a  motion under  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 12(b)(6)  without\r\n\nconverting  the  motion   into  one  for  summary   judgment.\r\n\nWatterson v. Page, 987  F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.  1993).  Courts\r                             \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Petitioner also seeks  review of the  denial of a  motion\r\nfor relief from judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).\r\r\n\nhave  routinely  regarded documents  from  prior  state court\r\n\ncases as public records.  See Henson v. CSC Credit Servs., 29\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 280, 284 (7th Cir. 1994) (collecting cases); 5A Wright &amp;\r\n\nMiller,  Federal Practice  and  Procedure    1364, at  475-80\r                                                     \r\n\n(1990) (court judgments and  orders, judicial notice of prior\r\n\npleadings, and transcripts of  prior court proceedings, among\r\n\nother  evidence, may be taken into account in deciding a Rule\r\n\n12(b)(6) motion).    Here, the  documents  relied on  by  the\r\n\ndistrict  court were  submitted as  habeas exhibits  and were\r\n\nutilized in framing the  habeas petition.  As such,  they are\r\n\npart of the pleadings.  Watterson, 987 F.2d at 4.\r                                             \r\n\n     In  a  similar  vein,  petitioner  argues  that  he  was\r\n\nentitled to  be given notice of the date the court planned to\r\n\ntake the  dismissal motion under  advisement.  The  court was\r\n\nnot required to give advance notice of its intent to  rule on\r\n\nthe motion.  See, e.g., Daniels v. Morris, 746 F.2d 271, 275-\r                                                     \r\n\n76  (5th Cir. 1984).  Under Rule 8(a), Rules Governing Habeas\r\n\nCases,  once  the  district  court  reviews  the  record  and\r\n\ndetermines that  an evidentiary hearing is  not required, the\r\n\ncourt  is authorized to  dispose of the  petition \"as justice\r\n\nshall require.\"  See also McBride v. Sharpe, 25 F.3d 962, 970\r                                                       \r\n\n(11th  Cir.), cert.  denied,  115 S.  Ct.  489 (1994).    The\r                                       \r\n\ndocuments  relied  on  by   the  district  court  provided  a\r\n\nsufficient  basis upon  which  to make  a  ruling without  an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing.   Moreover, petitioner had  a reasonably\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nsufficient opportunity to  file an  opposition; the  district\r\n\ncourt's disposition,  nine weeks after the  motion was filed,\r\n\nwas hardly premature.  Rasheed's  Rule 60(b) motion failed to\r\n\noffer  any indication  that with  additional notice  he would\r\n\nhave done something different that would have likely defeated\r\n\nthe Commonwealth's claim of  procedural default.  Under these\r\n\ncircumstances, petitioner had a  fair opportunity to meet the\r\n\nCommonwealth's objections to the filing of his petition.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nPrice v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 292-93 (1948).   There is no\r                             \r\n\nmerit  in  Rasheed's  complaint  that  the  district  court's\r\n\nfailure   to  give  notice  that  it  intended  to  render  a\r\n\ndisposition on the pending  dismissal motion violated his due\r\n\nprocess rights.\r\n\n                              II\r                                          II\r\n\n     It is also clear that petitioner's habeas claims -- that\r\n\nsuppression of evidence by the prosecution violated his right\r\n\nto  due  process under  Brady v.  Maryland,  373 U.S.  83, 87\r                                                      \r\n\n(1963), and  caused the  ineffective assistance of  his trial\r\n\ncounsel  --  are barred  by his  procedural default  in state\r\n\ncourt.  Petitioner attempted  to assert the same claims  in a\r\n\n1991 amended  motion for a  new trial under  Mass. R. Cr.  P.\r\n\n30(b), the  third attempt  since  his conviction  in 1975  to\r\n\nsecure such relief.  The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed\r\n\nthe denial  of a new  trial, ruling that  petitioner's claims\r\n\nhad been waived  because they  were not raised  at trial,  on\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ndirect  appeal,  or in  petitioner's  first  Rule 30  motion.\r\n\nCommonwealth v. Kines, No. 92-P-601 (Mass. App. Ct.  Feb. 24,\r                                 \r\n\n1993).   That  decision, the   \"last  reasoned opinion\"  by a\r\n\nstate court, Ylst  v. Nunnemaker, 501  U.S. 797, 803  (1991),\r                                            \r\n\nplainly relied upon an independent and adequate state ground.\r\n\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 739 (1991).  The fact that\r                               \r\n\nthe   Massachusetts   Appeals   Court    briefly   considered\r\n\npetitioner's defaulted claims in concluding that a remand for\r\n\ndiscretionary   review   under   Rule   30(c)(2)   would   be\r\n\ninappropriate, does not, as  petitioner would have it, remove\r\n\nthe  procedural bar for federal habeas purposes.  See Tart v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMassachusetts, 949 F.2d 490, 496-97 (1st Cir. 1991); see also\r                                                                         \r\n\nAllen v.  Massachusetts, 926  F.2d  74, 78  (1st Cir.  1991);\r                                   \r\n\nDoucette  v. Vose,  842  F.2d 538,  539-40  (1st Cir.  1988).\r                             \r\n\nDespite that brief discussion, it is obvious that the Appeals\r\n\nCourt  decision expressly  rested on  petitioner's procedural\r\n\ndefault.    Harris v.  Reed, 489  U.S.  255, 264  n.10 (1991)\r                                       \r\n\n(adequate and independent  state ground doctrine  applies \"as\r\n\nlong  as  the  state  decision  explicitly  invokes  a  state\r\n\nprocedural bar rule as a separate basis for decision\").  And,\r\n\nMassachusetts  cases   have  consistently  applied   a  state\r\n\nprocedural  bar to claims not  raised, as here,  at trial, on\r\n\ndirect  appeal, or  on  the first  motion for  postconviction\r\n\nrelief under  Rule 30.   See Commonwealth v.  McLaughlin, 364\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nMass.  211,  229  (1973).2   Consequently,  it  was  entirely\r\n\nappropriate  for  the district  court  to  find these  habeas\r\n\nclaims  barred in the absence  of a showing  by petitioner of\r\n\ncause for defaulting them in state court and actual prejudice\r\n\nresulting from that default, or  that the refusal to consider\r\n\nthe federal claims would lead to a fundamental miscarriage of\r\n\njustice.  Harris, 489 U.S. at 262; Tart, 949 F.2d at 496.\r                                                   \r\n\n     Petitioner has made no attempt whatsoever to demonstrate\r\n\ncause and prejudice that  would excuse his noncompliance with\r\n\nMassachusetts procedure,  except to claim  that his  attorney\r\n\nwas  ineffective.   But,  counsel's  decision  not to  pursue\r\n\npotential inconsistencies that might have come to light after\r\n\nsought-after police journal reports  were finally produced at\r\n\ntrial,3 a decision that suggests  at worst inadvertence or at\r\n\nbest reasonable trial strategy, cannot  constitute \"cause\" to\r\n\nrevive Rasheed's claims for federal habeas review.  See Smith\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Sec. 2254.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In agreeing with the district court that there is no basis to petitioner's claim of constitutional error, we add the following comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Rasheed essentially argues that the district court erred in concluding that his suppression and ineffective assistance claims are procedurally barred.  As an initial matter, petitioner contends that lack of notice of the impending denial of his petition was procedurally improper and deprived him of due process.  There is no merit to either claim.  Rasheed assumes that the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss was treated as a motion for summary judgment because the district court, in deciding the motion, relied on two of the exhibits attached to the habeas petition:  (1) the 1993 decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court upholding Rasheed's most recent attempt in state court to secure postconviction relief, and (2) an excerpt from the transcript of his jury trial in 1975.  However, a court may look to matters of public record in ruling on a motion under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.  Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1993).  Courts have routinely regarded documents from prior state court cases as public records.  See Henson v. CSC Credit Servs., 29 F.3d 280, 284 (7th Cir. 1994) (collecting cases);  5A Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 1364, at 475-80 (1990) (court judgments and orders, judicial notice of prior pleadings, and transcripts of prior court proceedings, among other evidence, may be taken into account in deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion).  Here, the documents relied on by the district court were submitted as habeas exhibits and were utilized in framing the habeas petition.  As such, they are part of the pleadings.  Watterson, 987 F.2d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a similar vein, petitioner argues that he was entitled to be given notice of the date the court planned to take the dismissal motion under advisement.  The court was not required to give advance notice of its intent to rule on the motion.  See, e.g., Daniels v. Morris, 746 F.2d 271, 275-76 (5th Cir. 1984).  Under Rule 8(a), Rules Governing Habeas Cases, once the district court reviews the record and determines that an evidentiary hearing is not required, the court is authorized to dispose of the petition \"as justice shall require.\"  See also McBride v. Sharpe, 25 F.3d 962, 970 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 489 (1994).  The documents relied on by the district court provided a sufficient basis upon which to make a ruling without an evidentiary hearing.  Moreover, petitioner had a reasonably sufficient opportunity to file an opposition;  the district court's disposition, nine weeks after the motion was filed, was hardly premature.  Rasheed's Rule 60(b) motion failed to offer any indication that with additional notice he would have done something different that would have likely defeated the Commonwealth's claim of procedural default.  Under these circumstances, petitioner had a fair opportunity to meet the Commonwealth's objections to the filing of his petition.  See Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 292-93 (1948).  There is no merit in Rasheed's complaint that the district court's failure to give notice that it intended to render a disposition on the pending dismissal motion violated his due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also clear that petitioner's habeas claims-that suppression of evidence by the prosecution violated his right to due process under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), and caused the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel-are barred by his procedural default in state court.  Petitioner attempted to assert the same claims in a 1991 amended motion for a new trial under Mass.  R. Cr. P. 30(b), the third attempt since his conviction in 1975 to secure such relief.  The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the denial of a new trial, ruling that petitioner's claims had been waived because they were not raised at trial, on direct appeal, or in petitioner's first Rule 30 motion.  Commonwealth v. Kines, No. 92-P-601 (Mass.  App. Ct. Feb. 24, 1993).  That decision, the \"last reasoned opinion\" by a state court, Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 803 (1991), plainly relied upon an independent and adequate state ground.  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 739 (1991).  The fact that the Massachusetts Appeals Court briefly considered petitioner's defaulted claims in concluding that a remand for discretionary review under Rule 30(c)(2) would be inappropriate, does not, as petitioner would have it, remove the procedural bar for federal habeas purposes.  See Tart v. Massachusetts, 949 F.2d 490, 496-97 (1st Cir. 1991);  see also Allen v. Massachusetts, 926 F.2d 74, 78 (1st Cir. 1991);  Doucette v. Vose, 842 F.2d 538, 539-40 (1st Cir. 1988).  Despite that brief discussion, it is obvious that the Appeals Court decision expressly rested on petitioner's procedural default.  Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 264 n.10 (1991) (adequate and independent state ground doctrine applies \"as long as the state decision explicitly invokes a state procedural bar rule as a separate basis for decision\").  And, Massachusetts cases have consistently applied a state procedural bar to claims not raised, as here, at trial, on direct appeal, or on the first motion for postconviction relief under Rule 30.  See Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, 364 Mass. 211, 229 (1973).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Consequently, it was entirely appropriate for the district court to find these habeas claims barred in the absence of a showing by petitioner of cause for defaulting them in state court and actual prejudice resulting from that default, or that the refusal to consider the federal claims would lead to a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  Harris, 489 U.S. at 262;  Tart, 949 F.2d at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner has made no attempt whatsoever to demonstrate cause and prejudice that would excuse his noncompliance with Massachusetts procedure, except to claim that his attorney was ineffective.  But, counsel's decision not to pursue potential inconsistencies that might have come to light after sought- after police journal reports were finally produced at trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> a decision that suggests at worst inadvertence or at best reasonable trial strategy, cannot constitute \"cause\" to revive Rasheed's claims for federal habeas review.  See Smith v. Murray, 477 U.S. 527, 534 (1986) (\"[A] deliberate, tactical decision not to pursue a particular claim is the very antithesis of the kind of circumstance that would warrant excusing a defendant's failure to adhere to a State's legitimate rules for the fair and orderly disposition of criminal cases.\");  see also Tart, 949 F.2d at 497.  Otherwise, the record fails even to hint that some factor external to the defense caused the default much less that interference by officials blocked petitioner's ability to comply with the state's procedural rules.  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 487 (1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Nor has Rasheed shown that review of the merits of his claims under the \"manifest miscarriage of justice\" exception noted in Smith, 477 U.S. at 537, is warranted.  There simply is \"no substantial claim that the alleged error[s] undermined the accuracy of the guilt ... determination,\" id. at 539, or any indication that this is the extraordinary case \"where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\"  Carrier, 477 U.S. at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, to the extent that Rasheed is attempting to complain that his habeas counsel was ineffective, no relief on that ground is available.  As there is no right to counsel in Sec. 2254 proceedings, McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 495 (1991), the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of habeas counsel does not apply.  See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 752;  Bonin v. Vasquez, 999 F.2d 425, 430 (9th Cir. 1993).  A petitioner seeking a certificate of probable cause from this court must affirmatively demonstrate that such cause in fact exists.  Glynn v. Donnelly, 485 F.2d 692, 693 (1st Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 957 (1974).  This means making a substantial showing of the denial of a federal right, i.e., that the \"issues are debatable among jurists of reason;  that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner;  or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\"  Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 893 n.4 (1983) (punctuation and citations omitted).
