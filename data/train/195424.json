Jonathan  B.  Haggert  appeals  a\n                     \n\ndistrict  court order granting  appellees' motion for summary\n\njudgment.  We affirm.\n\n                    I.  Background\n                                  \n\n          Haggert sued  the appellees,  who are employees  of\n\nHaggert's employer, Guilford of Maine, seeking to enjoin them\n\nfrom complying with an  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notice\n\nof  levy received by Guilford.  The notice of levy instructed\n\nGuilford to remit a  certain, non-exempt portion of Haggert's\n\nwages directly to the IRS to satisfy unpaid income taxes owed\n\nby Haggert.   After  Haggert filed suit,  Guilford apparently\n\nbegan complying with the notice of levy. \n\n          Haggert filed his suit  in state court, serving the\n\nappellees  with  the  summons  and complaint  on  August  26,\n\n1993.1  The appellees removed the action to  federal district\n\ncourt on September 24,  alleging that Haggert was challenging\n\nthe levy  procedure established in the  Internal Revenue Code\n\nand   that   the  court   therefore   had  federal   question\n\n                    \n\n1.  In  his  brief, Haggert  says  that  appellees failed  to\ntimely answer  his complaint.   That argument  appears to  be\nbased on  Haggert's belief  that he served  the complaint  on\nappellees on or  about August 9, 1993, when he unsuccessfully\nattempted  to have  them sign  a receipt  for the  complaint,\nrather than on August 26, when the summons and complaint were\nserved together on appellees as required under Maine R.  Civ.\nP.  4(d).   Since Haggert  acknowledges that  appellees filed\ntheir answer on or  about September 8, 1993 (the  record does\nnot show when the  answer was filed), we conclude  that their\nanswer was timely.   See  Maine R. Civ.  P. 12(a)  (requiring\n                        \ndefendants to serve their answer within 20 days after service\nof the summons and complaint).\n\n                             -2-\n\njurisdiction  under  28 U.S.C.    1331.    They also  filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, claiming that they were required\n\nby law to  comply with the notice of levy  and that they were\n\nimmune from being sued by Haggert for their compliance.  \n\nHaggert  filed a  motion for  remand on  the ground  that the\n\nappellees' notice  of removal was untimely.2   In affidavits,\n\nhe  asserted that he  had given a  copy of the  complaint \"in\n\nhand\" to the  appellees on  August 9, well  over thirty  days\n\nbefore they filed their notice  of removal.  See 28 U.S.C.   \n                                                \n\n1446(b) (\"The notice of  removal . . . shall  be filed within\n\nthirty  days  after the  receipt  by  the defendant,  through\n\nservice  or otherwise,  of  a copy  of  the initial  pleading\n\nsetting  forth the claim for relief upon which such action or\n\nproceeding is  based, . . .  .\").  Without denying  that they\n\nhad received  the complaint,  the appellees argued  that some\n\ncases held that  only proper service of process triggered the\n\nremoval period under section 1446(b).   Because they had  not\n\nbeen served until August  26, they claimed that their  notice\n\nof removal on September 24 was timely.  They also argued that\n\nHaggert's affidavits did not clearly state that the appellees\n\nhad received a  copy of the complaint,  but indicated instead\n\nthat  the appellees had refused to accept a proffered copy of\n\nthe complaint.\n\n                    \n\n2.  Haggert has  also argued  that the district  court lacked\njurisdiction  but, for  reasons  explained below,  this issue\ndoes not alter the outcome and need not be resolved.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          The  district court  denied  Haggert's  motion  for\n\nremand,  and subsequently granted  the appellees'  motion for\n\nsummary judgment.  \n\n                    II.  Discussion\n                                   \n\n          We need not determine  whether it is proper service\n\nor receipt of the complaint that triggers the  removal period\n\nunder section 1446(b), or  whether the appellees' removal was\n\ntimely  here.   As we  explain, Haggert  stands no  chance of\n\nsuccess in any  court of law.  Even if  we ordered remand, we\n\nare certain that the state court would promptly grant summary\n\njudgment for the appellees.  For that reason, remand would be\n\nunquestionably  futile and is not required.  Cf. Bell v. City\n                                                             \n\nof Kellogg,  922 F.2d 1418, 1424-25 (9th  Cir. 1991) (despite\n          \n\nthe district court's lack of  jurisdiction over the case once\n\nit  had determined  that  the appellants  lacked standing  to\n\npursue their federal  claims, the court of appeals found that\n\nthe  district court had  properly resolved the  merits of the\n\nremaining state claim; the court was \"certain\" that the state\n\ncourt  would  have dismissed  the  action  due to  appellees'\n\n\"fatal  failure\" to  meet  state  statutory prerequisites  to\n\nsuit, and so the district court's resolution of that question\n\nprevented \"any  further waste  of valuable judicial  time and\n\nresources\").\n\n          Turning  to  the  merits,  it  is  clear  that  the\n\ndistrict court  properly granted  the  appellees' motion  for\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nsummary  judgment.  It has been long established that the IRS\n\nmay constitutionally satisfy outstanding income taxes  by way\n\nof nonjudicial, administrative levy under 26 U.S.C.   6331 et\n\nseq.  See  United States  v. National Bank  of Commerce,  472\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 713, 720-21 (1985); Christensen v. United States, 733 F.\n                                                     \n\nSupp.  844 (D.N.J. 1990) (citing the  cases), aff'd, 925 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n416 (3d Cir.  1991) (table).   Custodians of property  levied\n\nupon by  the IRS must comply with the notice of levy; if they\n\ndo not, they become \"liable in [their] own person and estate\"\n\nto  the  government for  the sum  in  question and  may incur\n\nfurther penalty as  well.  See 26 U.S.C.    6332(d)(1) &amp; (2);\n                              \n\nNational  Bank of  Commerce,  472 U.S.  at 721.   If  they do\n                           \n\ncomply,  however,  they  are   immunized  from  liability  to\n\ndelinquent taxpayers for delivering such  taxpayers' property\n\nto  the  IRS.    Id.  (citing  the  statutory  language,  now\n                    \n\ncontained in 26 U.S.C.   6332(e), which discharges the person\n\nhonoring  the levy \"from  any obligation or  liability to the\n\ndelinquent  taxpayer with  respect  to such  property  . .  .\n\narising  from such  surrender  or payment\").   Custodians  of\n\nproperty levied upon have  only two defenses:  that  they are\n\nnot  in possession of the  property, or that  the property is\n\nsubject  to a prior judicial attachment or execution.  Id. at\n                                                          \n\n722,  727;  see  26  U.S.C.      6332(a)  (\"[A]ny  person  in\n               \n\npossession of (or obligated  with respect to) property .  . .\n\nupon which  a levy has been  made shall . .  . surrender such\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nproperty . .  . to  the Secretary [of  the Treasury],  except\n\nsuch part of the property  . . . as  is, at the time of  such\n\ndemand,  subject  to an  attachment  or  execution under  any\n\njudicial process.\").  \n\n          Haggert   does  not   dispute  that   Guilford  was\n\nobligated  to pay  him his  wages; he  does not  dispute that\n\nGuilford received  an IRS notice of  levy, directing Guilford\n\nto remit to the IRS certain, non-exempt portions of the wages\n\nwhich  Guilford owed to Haggert;3 he does not allege that his\n\nwages  were  subject  to   a  prior  judicial  attachment  or\n\nexecution.   Thus,  there is  no  question that  Guilford had\n\n\"possession of (or [was]  obligated with respect to property)\n\n. . .  upon which a levy has been made,\"  and was required to\n\nsurrender  that  property to  the IRS.    See Sims  v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 359  U.S. 108,  110-11 (1959) (\"accrued  salaries are\n      \n\nproperty  . . . subject to levy\"; state auditor, who deducted\n\ntaxes from  state employees' salaries and  issued warrants to\n\npay such salaries, was  a person \"obligated with respect  to\"\n\nthose salaries under  26 U.S.C.    6332(a)).   Those are  the\n\nmaterial   facts  in   this   case;   they  are   undisputed.\n\nAccordingly, Guilford  had no choice  but to comply  with the\n\nnotice  of levy, its employees may not be enjoined from doing\n\n                    \n\n3.  As noted above, the appellees began remitting portions of\nHaggert's wages to the IRS after Haggert filed suit.  Haggert\nhas  not alleged that the  sums remitted to  the IRS included\nexempt portions of his wages.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nso or be sued by Haggert for damages for having  done so, and\n\nthe district  court  correctly granted  summary  judgment  in\n\nappellees'  favor.   See Burroughs  v. Wallingford,  780 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n502,  503 (5th  Cir.  1986) (affirming  the district  court's\n\ndismissal of  delinquent taxpayers' suit against employees of\n\nthe  taxpayers' employer  who  had complied  with tax  levies\n\nordering  payment of a portion of the taxpayers' wages to the\n\nIRS).  \n\n          On  appeal, Haggert  makes  certain arguments  that\n\nchallenge  the  levy  procedure,  the income  tax  system  as\n\napplied to him, or the IRS's compliance with other provisions\n\nof  the tax code or other statutes.  Strictly speaking, those\n\narguments are not relevant to the present action which  seeks\n\nonly to prevent the appellees  from complying with the notice\n\nof levy despite a  statutory mandate that Guilford do  so and\n\nstatutory immunity  from  liability to  Haggert.    Haggert's\n\narguments  are  inappropriate  in  an  action  against  these\n                                                             \n\nappellees, see id. at 503 (arguments challenging the tax levy\n                  \n\nare  more  appropriately brought  in  an  action against  the\n\ngovernment), and  so we  need not consider  his arguments  in\n\norder to affirm the district court's decision.  See Schiff v.\n                                                          \n\nSimon  &amp; Schuster,  Inc., 780  F.2d 210,  212 (2d  Cir. 1985)\n                        \n\n(\"the  fact  that  appellant  disputes the  validity  of  the\n\nunderlying  tax   assessment  does  not   alter  [appellee's]\n\nobligation to honor the levy, . . . .\").  \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          Since the appellees seek attorneys' fees and double\n\ncosts, however, we  note that some of Haggert's  arguments or\n\nclose variants thereon have been rejected by the courts, most\n\nof them  long ago, and that others  are either based on false\n\npremises or misreadings of  the law or are just  plain wrong.\n\nIn  other words,  none  has any  merit.   We  recognize  that\n\nHaggert raised legitimate fact  issues relating to the remand\n\nquestion.  Nonetheless, even if  we had found the  appellees'\n\nnotice of  removal to have  been untimely, resolution  of the\n\nmerits of this case in favor of the appellees was inevitable.\n\nPrecedent was overwhelmingly  against Haggert's suit;  he had\n\nno ground for relief against these appellees, as the district\n\ncourt   explained  before   Haggert   brought   his   appeal.\n\nTherefore, his  appeal was frivolous  under Fed. R.  App. 38.\n\nSee E.H. Ashley &amp; Co. v.

Sec. 1331.  They also filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that they were required by law to comply with the notice of levy and that they were immune from being sued by Haggert for their compliance.  Haggert filed a motion for remand on the ground that the appellees' notice of removal was untimely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In affidavits, he asserted that he had given a copy of the complaint \"in hand\" to the appellees on August 9, well over thirty days before they filed their notice of removal.

City of Kellogg, 922 F.2d 1418, 1424-25 (9th Cir. 1991) (despite the district court's lack of jurisdiction over the case once it had determined that the appellants lacked standing to pursue their federal claims, the court of appeals found that the district court had properly resolved the merits of the remaining state claim;  the court was \"certain\" that the state court would have dismissed the action due to appellees' \"fatal failure\" to meet state statutory prerequisites to suit, and so the district court's resolution of that question prevented \"any further waste of valuable judicial time and resources\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, it is clear that the district court properly granted the appellees' motion for summary judgment.  It has been long established that the IRS may constitutionally satisfy outstanding income taxes by way of nonjudicial, administrative levy under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6331 et seq.   See United States v. National Bank of Commerce, 472 U.S. 713, 720-21 (1985);   Christensen v. United States, 733 F. Supp. 844 (D.N.J. 1990) (citing the cases), aff'd, 925 F.2d 416 (3d Cir. 1991) (table).  Custodians of property levied upon by the IRS must comply with the notice of levy;  if they do not, they become \"liable in [their] own person and estate\" to the government for the sum in question and may incur further penalty as well.  See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6332(d)(1) &amp; (2);   National Bank of Commerce, 472 U.S. at 721.  If they do comply, however, they are immunized from liability to delinquent taxpayers for delivering such taxpayers' property to the IRS.  Id. (citing the statutory language, now contained in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6332(e), which discharges the person honoring the levy \"from any obligation or liability to the delinquent taxpayer with respect to such property ... arising from such surrender or payment\").  Custodians of property levied upon have only two defenses:  that they are not in possession of the property, or that the property is subject to a prior judicial attachment or execution.  Id. at 722, 727;  see 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6332(a) (\"[A]ny person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property ... upon which a levy has been made shall ... surrender such property ... to the Secretary [of the Treasury], except such part of the property ... as is, at the time of such demand, subject to an attachment or execution under any judicial process.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haggert does not dispute that Guilford was obligated to pay him his wages;  he does not dispute that Guilford received an IRS notice of levy, directing Guilford to remit to the IRS certain, non-exempt portions of the wages which Guilford owed to Haggert;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> he does not allege that his wages were subject to a prior judicial attachment or execution.  Thus, there is no question that Guilford had \"possession of (or [was] obligated with respect to property) ... upon which a levy has been made,\" and was required to surrender that property to the IRS.   See Sims v. United States, 359 U.S. 108, 110-11 (1959) (\"accrued salaries are property ... subject to levy\";  state auditor, who deducted taxes from state employees' salaries and issued warrants to pay such salaries, was a person \"obligated with respect to\" those salaries under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6332(a)).  Those are the material facts in this case;  they are undisputed.  Accordingly, Guilford had no choice but to comply with the notice of levy, its employees may not be enjoined from doing so or be sued by Haggert for damages for having done so, and the district court correctly granted summary judgment in appellees' favor.   See Burroughs v. Wallingford, 780 F.2d 502, 503 (5th Cir. 1986) (affirming the district court's dismissal of delinquent taxpayers' suit against employees of the taxpayers' employer who had complied with tax levies ordering payment of a portion of the taxpayers' wages to the IRS).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Haggert makes certain arguments that challenge the levy procedure, the income tax system as applied to him, or the IRS's compliance with other provisions of the tax code or other statutes.  Strictly speaking, those arguments are not relevant to the present action which seeks only to prevent the appellees from complying with the notice of levy despite a statutory mandate that Guilford do so and statutory immunity from liability to Haggert.  Haggert's arguments are inappropriate in an action against these appellees, see id. at 503 (arguments challenging the tax levy are more appropriately brought in an action against the government), and so we need not consider his arguments in order to affirm the district court's decision.   See Schiff v. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., 780 F.2d 210, 212 (2d Cir. 1985) (\"the fact that appellant disputes the validity of the underlying tax assessment does not alter [appellee's] obligation to honor the levy,....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the appellees seek attorneys' fees and double costs, however, we note that some of Haggert's arguments or close variants thereon have been rejected by the courts, most of them long ago, and that others are either based on false premises or misreadings of the law or are just plain wrong.  In other words, none has any merit.  We recognize that Haggert raised legitimate fact issues relating to the remand question.  Nonetheless, even if we had found the appellees' notice of removal to have been untimely, resolution of the merits of this case in favor of the appellees was inevitable.  Precedent was overwhelmingly against Haggert's suit;  he had no ground for relief against these appellees, as the district court explained before Haggert brought his appeal.  Therefore, his appeal was frivolous under Fed.  R. App. 38.  See E.H. Ashley &amp; Co. v.  Wells Fargo Alarm Services, 907 F.2d 1274, 1280 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we grant appellees' request for double costs.

Haggert appeals a district court order granting appellees' motion for summary judgment.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haggert sued the appellees, who are employees of Haggert's employer, Guilford of Maine, seeking to enjoin them from complying with an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notice of levy received by Guilford.  The notice of levy instructed Guilford to remit a certain, non-exempt portion of Haggert's wages directly to the IRS to satisfy unpaid income taxes owed by Haggert.  After Haggert filed suit, Guilford apparently began complying with the notice of levy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haggert filed his suit in state court, serving the appellees with the summons and complaint on August 26, 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The appellees removed the action to federal district court on September 24, alleging that Haggert was challenging the levy procedure established in the Internal Revenue Code and that the court therefore had federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331.  They also filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that they were required by law to comply with the notice of levy and that they were immune from being sued by Haggert for their compliance.  Haggert filed a motion for remand on the ground that the appellees' notice of removal was untimely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In affidavits, he asserted that he had given a copy of the complaint \"in hand\" to the appellees on August 9, well over thirty days before they filed their notice of removal.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1446(b) (\"The notice of removal ... shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based,....\").   Without denying that they had received the complaint, the appellees argued that some cases held that only proper service of process triggered the removal period under section 1446(b).  Because they had not been served until August 26, they claimed that their notice of removal on September 24 was timely.  They also argued that Haggert's affidavits did not clearly state that the appellees had received a copy of the complaint, but indicated instead that the appellees had refused to accept a proffered copy of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Haggert's motion for remand, and subsequently granted the appellees' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not determine whether it is proper service or receipt of the complaint that triggers the removal period under section 1446(b), or whether the appellees' removal was timely here.
