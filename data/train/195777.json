This is a  difficult labor-law\r                                       \n\ncase made even more difficult because the pertinent doctrines\n\nhave  confusing   labels,  overlap  with   one  another   and\n\noccasionally mutate.  We begin with the facts and  procedural\n\nhistory,  and then address the legal issues and the claims of\n\nerror.\n\n                              I.\n\n     For  many  years,  Hospital  San   Rafael,  Inc.,  (\"San\n\nRafael\")  operated a neighborhood  hospital in Caguas, Puerto\n\nRico.  In 1978,  two doctors--Jaime Soler and  Jose Badillo--\n\nbought  somewhat over 80 percent of San Rafael's stock; Soler\n\nowned  about 70  percent of  the joint  holdings and  Badillo\n\nabout 30  percent.  The doctors then  hired Joaquin Rodriguez\n\nas  the  hospital's  president.     These  three  individuals\n\ncomprised the hospital's board.\n\n     San  Rafael was in poor financial shape, and in mid 1978\n\nthe  Puerto Rico  health authorities  said that  the hospital\n\nwould have to remedy  problems in its physical plant  or lose\n\nits  eligibility   to  treat  Medicare  patients.    Medicare\n\npatients  accounted   for  almost  half  of   the  hospital's\n\noccupancy.  Soler, Badillo and Rodriguez began to discuss the\n\nconstruction of a new hospital.   It was conceived that a new\n\ncorporation  would be established,  partly because San Rafael\n\nitself could not obtain  loan funds, and in addition  the new\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nhospital was expected to be more than a local hospital and to\n\ndraw patients from the Caribbean basin.\n\n     Centro Medico was created in  August 1978 to operate the\n\nproposed  new hospital under the name Hospital Interamericano\n\nde Medicina Avanzada (\"Hospital  Interamericano\").  In  1981,\n\nSoler  had 40 percent of  the shares, Badillo  20 percent and\n\nRodriguez  20 percent.    Ultimately,  Soler's ownership  was\n\nreduced to 38 percent, Badillo and Rodriguez each owned about\n\n19  percent, and 19 percent was acquired by Carlos Pineiro, a\n\nlongtime associate  of Rodriguez.   From the  start Rodriguez\n\nwas  Centro Medico's  president, and  Soler and  Badillo were\n\namong the board members.\n\n     At various times, Rodriguez spoke about the new hospital\n\nas if it were an expansion of San Rafael, and San Rafael made\n\ninterest-free cash  advances for the construction  of the new\n\nhospital  and took  other steps  to support  its development.\n\nSan  Rafael  was  granted  a   waiver  as  to  its   Medicare\n\ndeficiencies  because of  the plans  to open a  new hospital.\n\nLater,  San  Rafael agreed  to surrender  its own  license to\n\noperate a hospital,  in order to facilitate the  licensing of\n\nthe new hospital.  \n\n     San Rafael ceased  operation on November  14, 1988.   On\n\nNovember 18, 1988, the  new Centro Medico hospital, operating\n\nas Hospital Interamericano, opened to the public.  Rodriguez,\n\nSoler and  Badillo continued  to hold their  prior positions.\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nPineiro,  who  since  1987  had been  responsible  for  labor\n\nrelations at San Rafael,  became the new hospital's executive\n\nvice  president.  A majority of the supervisors of San Rafael\n\nand  most of  the  other  employees  transferred to  the  new\n\nhospital.\n\n     Against  this background  labor disputes  developed that\n\nled  to the present litigation.   In January  1984, the Union\n\nNacional  de  Trabajadores  de  la Salud,  Local  1199  (\"the\n\nunion\")   became   the   certified    collective   bargaining\n\nrepresentative  of  two units  of  San Rafael  employees:   a\n\nprofessional unit (e.g.,  registered nurses) and  a technical\r                                   \n\nunit that included other employees.  San Rafael and the union\n\nentered into  an agreement effective from  September 1, 1984,\n\nto August  31, 1987, also  agreeing that this  contract would\n\ncontinue until a new contract replaced it.\n\n     San  Rafael employee Milton Suarez  had been a leader in\n\nthe organization of the union and had been discharged for his\n\norganizing  activities, although  later  reinstated.   Suarez\n\nhelped negotiate  the September 1984 contract  and became the\n\nunion's chief steward.  In 1985, Suarez began to question San\n\nRafael about the  effect that the planned  new hospital would\n\nhave on job security.  On August 30, 1985, Rodriguez issued a\n\nmemorandum  to San  Rafael  employees stating  \"on behalf  of\n\nHospital San Rafael and of Centro Medico del Turabo\" that the\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nemployees  would be  \"transferred\" with  the same  salary and\n\nbenefits to the new hospital.  \n\n     In May 1987, the union  sought to begin negotiations for\n\na new  contract and  proposed  an agreement  naming both  San\n\nRafael and  Centro Medico as  parties.  San  Rafael indicated\n\nthat Centro  Medico would not  recognize or bargain  with the\n\nunion  because it was certified  only to represent San Rafael\n\nemployees.   The National Labor Relations  Board (the \"Board\"\n\nor \"NLRB\")  issued a complaint  charging that San  Rafael and\n\nCentro  Medico were a single employer and alter egos, and had\n\nunlawfully  refused  to  bargain  with  the  union  over  the\n\ninclusion of Centro Medico.\n\n     The  union reached  separate settlement  agreements with\n\nSan Rafael and Centro Medico in  May 1988.  San Rafael agreed\n\nto  negotiate in good faith with the union, and Centro Medico\n\npromised  to hire on a  nondiscriminatory basis and to retain\n\n95  percent  of San  Rafael's employees  to  work at  the new\n\nhospital; Centro  Medico stipulated  that it was  not thereby\n\nagreeing  to recognize the union.  The union, in exchange for\n\nthe settlements, withdrew its  unfair labor practice charges,\n\nand the NLRB then withdrew the complaint.  \n\n     Negotiations between the union and the two hospitals did\n\nnot  prove  fruitful.   In October  1988,  the union  filed a\n\npetition  with  the  NLRB  seeking  to  have  the  settlement\n\nagreements  set  aside, and  the  pre-agreement unfair  labor\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\npractice  charges  reopened,  because  San   Rafael  had  not\n\ncomplied  with the settlement agreement.  In August 1989, the\n\ndistrict  court granted  a  preliminary injunction  requiring\n\nCentro  Medico to  bargain  in  good  faith, and  this  court\n\naffirmed.  See Asseo  v. Centro Medico del Turabo,  Inc., 900\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 445 (1st Cir. 1991).  \n\n     From the outset  in 1988, the new Centro Medico hospital\n\nclaimed  that it was free to alter working conditions at will\n\nand that it need not recognize the union.   Although most San\n\nRafael employees were hired  by the new hospital,  Suarez was\n\nnot.   Neither were four other employees who had been closely\n\nconnected  with union  activities and  acted at  one time  or\n\nanother  as  union stewards.   In  these  five cases  the new\n\nhospital  did  not formally  refuse  to  hire the  employees;\n\nseveral were told that  their applications were under review,\n\nbut  Centro  Medico then  took  no  official  action  on  the\n\napplications.\n\n     In  December  1989, the  union  filed  new unfair  labor\n\npractice charges.  These included charges that both hospitals\n\nhad failed to bargain in good faith and had engaged in unfair\n\nlabor practices  by refusing  to hire the  five union-related\n\nemployees.  A Board complaint was filed in February 1989.  On\n\nMay 4,  1989, an  administrative law  judge entered  an order\n\nconditionally  setting  aside   the  settlement   agreements,\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nreinstating the  old charges and consolidating  them with new\n\nones.  Hearings were held between May 1989 and May 1990.\n\n     On  June 19,  1991, the  ALJ found  that San  Rafael and\n\nCentro  Medico  were  alter   egos  and  comprised  a  single\n\nemployer;  alternatively, Centro  Medico  was found  to be  a\n\nsuccessor employer to San Rafael.  The ALJ found that the San\n\nRafael  settlement agreement  had  been entered  into in  bad\n\nfaith  and should  be permanently  set aside.   The  ALJ also\n\nfound that  the hospitals had violated their duty to bargain,\n\n29 U.S.C.    158(a)(5), and Centro  Medico's failure to  hire\n\nfour of the  five employees  was also found  to be  wrongful.\n\nId.   158(a)(3).\r               \n\n     On  review, the  Board,  acting  through three  members,\n\nfound that the two hospitals were a single employer and alter\n\negos but  did not reach  the successor-employer  issue.   The\n\nBoard  agreed with the ALJ  that the hospitals had improperly\n\nfailed to bargain with  the union and that Centro  Medico had\n\nunilaterally changed employee working conditions.  Failure to\n\nrehire all five  employees was  found to be  improper.  By  a\n\ndivided vote, the  Board held that the San  Rafael settlement\n\nagreement was properly set aside.\n\n     The Board entered  a remedial order containing  specific\n\nprovisions designed to compel Centro Medico to bargain and to\n\nprovide redress for the five employees.  The Board order also\n\nbroadly   forbade  future   infringement  of   worker  rights\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nprotected under  \"section 7.\"   29 U.S.C.    157.   The Board\n\nthen filed in  this court the present application  to enforce\n\nits order.   29 U.S.C.    160(e).  The hospitals  opposed the\n\napplication.\n\n                             II.\n\n     In this court, the main issue raised by the hospitals is\n\nwhether  San  Rafael and  Centro  Medico can  be  treated for\n\npresent  purposes as if they were one  entity.  This issue is\n\ncritical  because  the   only  signed  collective  bargaining\n\nagreement is between the union and San Rafael.  Centro Medico\n\nis  required to  respect that  agreement, and  bargain before\n\nmaking  unilateral  changes  in working  conditions,  only if\n\nCentro  Medico is an extension  of San Rafael.   We therefore\n\nbegin  by describing  three different  but related  labor-law\n\ndoctrines considered by the agency.\n\n     One  concept,  known  colloquially  as  the   alter  ego\n\ndoctrine, says that in certain situations one employer entity\n\nwill  be regarded as a continuation of a predecessor, and the\n\ntwo will be treated  interchangeably for purposes of applying\n\nlabor laws.  The easiest  example is a case where the  second\n\nentity  is created by the owners of the first for the purpose\r                                                                         \n\nof  evading  labor  law  responsibilities;  but  identity  of\n\nownership, management, work force,  business and the like are\n\nalso  relevant.   See  C.E.K. Indus.  Mechanical Contractors,\r                                                                         \n\nInc. v. NLRB, 921 F.2d 350 (1st Cir. 1990).  \r                        \n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     A second rubric--the \"single employer\" doctrine--has its\n\nprimary  office in the  case of two  ongoing businesses which\n\nthe NLRB wishes  to treat as a single employer  on the ground\n\nthat they are owned and operated as a single unit.   Penntech\r                                                                         \n\nPapers, Inc. v. NLRB,  706 F.2d 18 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,\r                                                                        \n\n464 U.S. 892 (1983).   Most of the alter ego  criteria remain\n\nrelevant but  motive is normally considered  irrelevant.  The\n\nconsequences of single employer and alter ego  status are not\n\nnecessarily the same.  See C.E.K., 921 F.2d at 354.  \r                                             \n\n     A   final,  narrower   doctrine  applies   to  so-called\n\n\"successor\" companies.    Where,  for  example,  a  unionized\n\nbusiness is acquired by a new owner unaffiliated with the old\n\none,  the new  employer  may not  be  bound by  a  collective\n\nbargaining agreement with  the old  one.  See  NLRB v.  Burns\r                                                                         \n\nSec.  Servs.,  406  U.S.  272  (1972).    But   where  enough\r                        \n\ncontinuity exists  in the  business and  work force, the  new\n\nowner  may, without  any  new certification,  be required  to\n\ntreat the  union as the  recognized bargaining agent.   E.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nFall  River Dyeing  &amp; Finishing  Corp. v.  NLRB, 482  U.S. 27\r                                                           \n\n(1987).  \n\n     This overview of  the three doctrines imparts  to them a\n\nneatness that is not borne out by the circuit caselaw or even\n\nthe Board's  decisions.  See,  e.g., 4 T. Kheel,  Labor Law  \r                                                                       \n\n17.02 (1994).    In  part,  the difficulty  is  that  several\n\nrelated  and  similarly  named  concepts are  being  used  to\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\naddress   different   controversies   (e.g.,   jurisdictional\r                                                       \n\naggregation,  maintenance  of  parallel  union  and non-union\n\nbusinesses,   inherited   liability   for  past   misconduct,\n\ninherited contractual obligations,  carry-over obligation  to\n\nbargain, etc.).  \r                        \n\n     In  all events, the Board's order here in dispute can be\n\nsustained  on  the alter  ego  theory.   The  single employer\n\ndoctrine,  as it  has developed  historically, seems  to have\n\nlittle application  to this case--which does  not involve two\n\nongoing businesses coordinated  by a common  master.

As for  \"successor\" status,  any\n\nrelief available under this theory would be less far reaching\n\nthan that based on the alter ego theory.\n\n     In determining alter ego status, the NLRB and the courts\n\nhave, as  noted in  C.E.K., considered  a  range of  criteria\r                                      \n\nincluding the similarity between the old and new companies in\n\nrelation   to   management,   business  purpose,   operation,\n\nequipment, customers  and supervision, as well  as ownership.\n\nIn  most cases,  a  further important  factor in  determining\n\nalter  ego status is whether the alleged alter ego entity was\n\ncreated and  maintained in order to  avoid labor obligations.\n\nIn a rare discussion of the doctrine, the Supreme Court said:\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n          It is important to  emphasize that this is not\n     a  case where  the  successor  corporation  is  the\n     \"alter ego\" of the predecessor, where it is \"merely\n     a  disguised  continuance  of  the  old  employer.\"\n     Southport Petroleum Co. v.  NLRB, 315 U.S. 100, 106\r                                                 \n     (1942).  Such cases involve a mere technical change\n     in the  structure  or  identity  of  the  employing\n     entity, frequently to avoid the effect of the labor\n     laws,   without  any  substantial   change  in  its\n     ownership or management.   In these  circumstances,\n     the courts have had  little difficulty holding that\n     the successor  is in reality the  same employer and\n     is  subject  to  all   the  legal  and  contractual\n     obligations of the predecessor.\n\nHoward  Johnson Co. v. Hotel Employees, 417 U.S. 249, 259 n.5\r                                                  \n\n(1974).\n\n     Howard  Johnson supplies  an animating  purpose for  the\r                                \n\nalter ego doctrine,  and also helps sort out the relationship\n\nbetween subjective  motive  and objective  criteria.   Motive\n\nmatters,   we  think,   because   a  corporate   transfer  or\n\ntransformation  for  the   purpose  of  avoiding   labor  law\r                                              \n\nobligations  is an  unsympathetic  case  for  respecting  the\n\nformal alteration, and faced  with a subterfuge--e.g., a sham\r                                                                 \n\ntransfer  of assets--the  courts  reasonably  need give  less\n\nweight  to  the  other  \"identity\" criteria.    See  Penntech\r                                                                         \n\nPapers, 706 F.2d at 24.\r                  \n\n     But  in our own case the decision of San Rafael's owners\n\nto  establish  a  new  hospital occurred  for  financial  and\n\noperational  reasons  that  have  nothing to  do  with  labor\n\nrelations.   The union did  not even exist  when the original\n\nplans for the new hospital were laid.  The Board's claim that\n\nCentro Medico's \"purpose\" was not  improper at the outset but\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nbecame  improper  simply because  Centro  Medico  declined to\n\nbargain  makes little sense in  the context of  the alter ego\n\ndoctrine.  After  all, if  the two companies  were not  alter\r                                     \n\negos,   Centro  Medico's  desire  to  resist  obligations  or\n\nliabilities of  San Rafael  would be  understandable.   If an\n\nimproper  motive in creating the  new entity were  a sine qua\r                                                                         \n\nnon of the alter ego doctrine, then we think the Board  would\r               \n\nbe hard-pressed to defend its order in this case.\n\n     In Howard Johnson, however,  the Supreme Court said that\r                                  \n\nwrongful  motive is  \"frequently\"  present in  the alter  ego\n\ncases; it did not say \"always.\"  Similarly, we have said that\n\n\"[n]o  one factor is controlling, and all need not be present\n\nto support a  finding of  `alter ego status.'\"   C.E.K.,  921\r                                                                   \n\nF.2d at  354.   After all,  if a  company merely  changed its\n\ncorporate form for legitimate tax or corporate reasons, it is\n\nhard to see why the new entity should be able to disregard an\n\nexisting  collective bargaining  agreement or  claim immunity\n\nwhen told to reinstate a worker wrongly fired by the old one.\n\nThis view--that a wrongful  motive is not required--is shared\n\nby  most other circuits.

Continuity of ownership,  perhaps\n\nthe most important predicate, does exist in this case.  Soler\n\nand Badillo owned 87 percent of the stock in San Rafael;  and\n\nthe  same individuals  came to  own about  60 percent  of the\n\nstock in  Centro Medico, their proportionate  shares inter se\r                                                                         \n\nremaining the same.  The two  other important stockholders of\n\nCentro Medico, Rodriguez and Pineiro, were closely associated\n\nwith San Rafael.\n\n     Other criteria of identity  point in the same direction.\n\nIn upper  management, Rodriguez  served as president  both of\n\nSan Rafael and Centro Medico.  Soler, Badillo,  Rodriguez and\n\nPineiro were directors, officers  or both in each of  the two\n\nentities.  The ALJ found that about 85 of the 102 lower level\n\nsupervisors at  the new hospital had also been supervisors at\n\nthe  old one.  The new hospital  agreed to hire 95 percent or\n\nmore  of the old hospital's  employees and the  ALJ said that\n\nthis had occurred.\n\n     The two  hospitals are in the same  business and operate\n\nin  the  same  community.   It  is  true  that Centro  Medico\n\n                    \r                                \n\nor  suggestion of en banc reconsideration on any issue in the\ncase.

Rivera Vazquez,\r                                                                        \n977 F.2d 1, 9 n.5 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\noperates  a  300-bed tertiary  care  hospital  and presumably\n\ndraws from a  larger area;  San Rafael was  a local  hospital\n\nwith  just  over  100 beds.    Little  of  the equipment  was\n\ntransferred from one to the other and doctors' privileges had\n\nto  be renewed.  But  San Rafael effectively  planned the new\n\nhospital, helped  finance it, and surrendered  its license so\n\nthe  new one  could obtain  a  license.   Both in  origin and\n\nfunction, the  new hospital is essentially  an enlargement of\n\nthe old one.\n\n     Thus,  a  substantial--not  a complete--identity  exists\n\nbetween  the  two hospitals  along  every  axis:   ownership,\n\nsenior  management,  supervisory  management, employee  base,\n\ngeographic location  and basic business function.   The alter\n\nego doctrine has been  devised by the Board with  approval of\n\nthe courts,  and  the  agency  is entitled  to  a  reasonable\n\nlatitude in applying  its own doctrine.  See generally Phelps\r                                                                         \n\nDodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177  (1941).  Whether the alter\r                               \n\nego doctrine can be  stretched much beyond the present  facts\n\nmay be open  to debate,  but this case  is within  reasonable\n\nlimits.\n\n       Next,  San  Rafael  claims  that  the  Board  was  not\n\nwarranted  in  setting aside  the  May  19, 1988,  settlement\n\nagreement  between the union and San Rafael.  In prior cases,\n\nthe  Board has  set  aside settlements  where the  settlement\n\nagreement  has  been   materially  breached  and   the  party\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nresponsible entered  into the agreement in  bad faith without\n\nan  intention to  carry out  its  commitments.   E.g., Norris\r                                                                         \n\nConcrete Materials, 282  N.L.R.B. 289 (1986).   In this case,\r                              \n\nthe ALJ set the settlement agreement aside on the ground that\n\nSan Rafael entered into it in bad faith and then breached the\n\nagreement.  The Board sustained this determination by  a two-\n\nto-one vote, one member dissenting on this issue alone.\n\n     We  review the findings  of the Board  only to determine\n\nwhether  they  are supported  by  substantial  evidence.   29\n\nU.S.C.   160(e).   The ALJ, whose rationale was  adopted in a\n\ncondensed form  by  the Board  majority,  said that  the  two\n\nhospitals had to know of  their own internal relationship and\n\ntherefore, knew or  should have known  their legal status  as\n\nalter egos; that the promise by San Rafael to bargain in good\n\nfaith therefore included a commitment to bargain on behalf of\n\nCentro  Medico; and  that  because San  Rafael resisted  that\n\nobligation  it  must  never  have  meant  to carry  out  this\n\nattributed commitment.\n\n     We think that this reasoning is unpersuasive and that no\n\nother evidence shows  that the agreement was entered  into in\n\nbad faith.  There is proof that San Rafael knew that it had a\n\nduty to  bargain for Centro  Medico.   The ALJ said  that San\n\nRafael  \"should  have known\"  of  its  prospective alter  ego\n\nstatus, but  we do not  see why.   The two hospitals  are not\n\nidentical   in   every  respect,   no   mathematical  formula\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\ndetermines  alter ego status, and  this case is  a close one.\n\nBad  faith is  more  than mere  negligence.   See  Voccio  v.\r                                                                     \n\nReliance  Ins. Cos.,  703 F.2d  1, 2  (1st Cir.  1983).   The\r                               \n\nBoard's brief hints that  bad faith may not be  required, but\n\nbad faith  was the only  basis given  in this case.   SEC  v.\r                                                                     \n\nChenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943).\r                         \n\n     However,  there is no showing  by the hospitals that the\n\nsetting aside of the settlement  agreement had any effect  on\n\nthe Board's  other determinations or on any of the provisions\n\nof  its   remedial  order.    Conduct   occurring  after  the\r                                                                    \n\nsettlement  agreement was  the  subject of  new unfair  labor\n\npractice  charges  in December  1988.    These included  both\n\nfailure to bargain and  discrimination against union members.\n\nThese  charges are amply supported by the record even if only\n\nconduct after May 1988 is the focus of consideration.\n\n     On   the  failure  to   bargain  charge,  Centro  Medico\n\npersistently  refused to  recognize  the union  and,  shortly\n\nafter the  new hospital opened, it made unilateral changes in\n\nthe  employees'  working  conditions  without  attempting  to\n\nbargain.   Since we have upheld the alter ego theory advanced\n\nby the Board, we think that it follows that Centro Medico was\n\nobligated to recognize  and bargain with  the union; that  it\n\nwas bound by the collective  bargaining agreement to the same\n\nextent as San Rafael; and that it was subject to the ordinary\n\nobligations of an employer with a union contract to negotiate\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nabout changes.  Good faith is not generally a defense to such\n\ncharges.  ILGWU v. NLRB, 366 U.S. 731, 738-40 (1961); NLRB v.\r                                                                      \n\nCooke &amp; Jones, Inc., 339 F.2d 580, 581 (1st Cir. 1964).\r                               \n\n     The Board  also had ample evidence for  its finding that\n\nthe  five named union members not rehired were the subject of\n\nanti-union discrimination by Centro Medico.  It is sufficient\n\nto  say  that all  five  employees were  identified  with the\n\nunion,  no persuasive reason appears  why any of  them was so\n\nrefused  a position at the  new hospital, and  the excuses or\n\nevasions practiced by Centro  Medico in dealing with  each of\n\nthe five affirmatively suggests that discrimination was being\n\npracticed.  The Board  and administrative law judge decisions\n\nadequately set forth the circumstances.  \n\n     We  turn now  to  remedy.   The  treatment of  the  five\n\nemployees was  egregious enough to justify  the Board's broad\n\nremedial direction  that the hospitals cease  and desist from\n\ninfringing  \"in any  other  manner\" on  employees' section  7\n\nrights.  The hospitals  say that a proper order  would merely\n\nprohibit Centro Medico  from acting \"in  any like or  related\n\nmanner,\" but  the broader version--carrying with  it the risk\n\nof  contempt  sanctions--has  been  found  proper  where  the\n\nemployer's  violations  are  either  repeated  or  egregious.\n\nWyman-Gordon  Co. v.  NLRB, 654  F.2d 134,  146-47 (1st  Cir.\r                                      \n\n1985).  None of the other remedial provisions are challenged,\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nand each other  remedy appears  justified by  post-settlement\n\nmisconduct by the hospitals.\n\n                             III.\n\n     To  sum up,  we agree  with the  hospitals that  the bad\n\nfaith finding as to  the May 1988 settlement and  the setting\n\naside  of  the  San   Rafael  settlement  agreement  are  not\n\nsupported.    We  are   also  doubtful  whether  the  \"single\n\nemployer\"  doctrine  could  be  a basis  for  sustaining  the\n\nBoard's  order.    But  the  alter  ego  doctrine  reasonably\n\napplies; the  unfair labor practice  findings are  adequately\n\nsupported by the post-settlement misconduct; and the remedies\n\nordered are  within the Board's discretion.   Accordingly, we\n\nenforce the Board's order as written.\n\n     It is so ordered.\r                                 \n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n",

We begin with the facts and  procedural\n\nhistory,  and then address the legal issues and the claims of\n\nerror.\n\n                              I.\n\n     For  many  years,  Hospital  San   Rafael,  Inc.,  (\"San\n\nRafael\")  operated a neighborhood  hospital in Caguas, Puerto\n\nRico.  In 1978,  two doctors--Jaime Soler and  Jose Badillo--\n\nbought  somewhat over 80 percent of San Rafael's stock; Soler\n\nowned  about 70  percent of  the joint  holdings and  Badillo\n\nabout 30  percent.  The doctors then  hired Joaquin Rodriguez\n\nas  the  hospital's  president.     These  three  individuals\n\ncomprised the hospital's board.\n\n     San  Rafael was in poor financial shape, and in mid 1978\n\nthe  Puerto Rico  health authorities  said that  the hospital\n\nwould have to remedy  problems in its physical plant  or lose\n\nits  eligibility   to  treat  Medicare  patients.    Medicare\n\npatients  accounted   for  almost  half  of   the  hospital's\n\noccupancy.  Soler, Badillo and Rodriguez began to discuss the\n\nconstruction of a new hospital.   It was conceived that a new\n\ncorporation  would be established,  partly because San Rafael\n\nitself could not obtain  loan funds, and in addition  the new\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nhospital was expected to be more than a local hospital and to\n\ndraw patients from the Caribbean basin.\n\n     Centro Medico was created in  August 1978 to operate the\n\nproposed  new hospital under the name Hospital Interamericano\n\nde Medicina Avanzada (\"Hospital  Interamericano\").  In  1981,\n\nSoler  had 40 percent of  the shares, Badillo  20 percent and\n\nRodriguez  20 percent.    Ultimately,  Soler's ownership  was\n\nreduced to 38 percent, Badillo and Rodriguez each owned about\n\n19  percent, and 19 percent was acquired by Carlos Pineiro, a\n\nlongtime associate  of Rodriguez.   From the  start Rodriguez\n\nwas  Centro Medico's  president, and  Soler and  Badillo were\n\namong the board members.\n\n     At various times, Rodriguez spoke about the new hospital\n\nas if it were an expansion of San Rafael, and San Rafael made\n\ninterest-free cash  advances for the construction  of the new\n\nhospital  and took  other steps  to support  its development.\n\nSan  Rafael  was  granted  a   waiver  as  to  its   Medicare\n\ndeficiencies  because of  the plans  to open a  new hospital.\n\nLater,  San  Rafael agreed  to surrender  its own  license to\n\noperate a hospital,  in order to facilitate the  licensing of\n\nthe new hospital.  \n\n     San Rafael ceased  operation on November  14, 1988.   On\n\nNovember 18, 1988, the  new Centro Medico hospital, operating\n\nas Hospital Interamericano, opened to the public.  Rodriguez,\n\nSoler and  Badillo continued  to hold their  prior positions.\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nPineiro,  who  since  1987  had been  responsible  for  labor\n\nrelations at San Rafael,  became the new hospital's executive\n\nvice  president.  A majority of the supervisors of San Rafael\n\nand  most of  the  other  employees  transferred to  the  new\n\nhospital.\n\n     Against  this background  labor disputes  developed that\n\nled  to the present litigation.   In January  1984, the Union\n\nNacional  de  Trabajadores  de  la Salud,  Local  1199  (\"the\n\nunion\")   became   the   certified    collective   bargaining\n\nrepresentative  of  two units  of  San Rafael  employees:   a\n\nprofessional unit (e.g.,  registered nurses) and  a technical\r                                   \n\nunit that included other employees.  San Rafael and the union\n\nentered into  an agreement effective from  September 1, 1984,\n\nto August  31, 1987, also  agreeing that this  contract would\n\ncontinue until a new contract replaced it.\n\n     San  Rafael employee Milton Suarez  had been a leader in\n\nthe organization of the union and had been discharged for his\n\norganizing  activities, although  later  reinstated.   Suarez\n\nhelped negotiate  the September 1984 contract  and became the\n\nunion's chief steward.  In 1985, Suarez began to question San\n\nRafael about the  effect that the planned  new hospital would\n\nhave on job security.  On August 30, 1985, Rodriguez issued a\n\nmemorandum  to San  Rafael  employees stating  \"on behalf  of\n\nHospital San Rafael and of Centro Medico del Turabo\" that the\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nemployees  would be  \"transferred\" with  the same  salary and\n\nbenefits to the new hospital.  \n\n     In May 1987, the union  sought to begin negotiations for\n\na new  contract and  proposed  an agreement  naming both  San\n\nRafael and  Centro Medico as  parties.  San  Rafael indicated\n\nthat Centro  Medico would not  recognize or bargain  with the\n\nunion  because it was certified  only to represent San Rafael\n\nemployees.   The National Labor Relations  Board (the \"Board\"\n\nor \"NLRB\")  issued a complaint  charging that San  Rafael and\n\nCentro  Medico were a single employer and alter egos, and had\n\nunlawfully  refused  to  bargain  with  the  union  over  the\n\ninclusion of Centro Medico.\n\n     The  union reached  separate settlement  agreements with\n\nSan Rafael and Centro Medico in  May 1988.  San Rafael agreed\n\nto  negotiate in good faith with the union, and Centro Medico\n\npromised  to hire on a  nondiscriminatory basis and to retain\n\n95  percent  of San  Rafael's employees  to  work at  the new\n\nhospital; Centro  Medico stipulated  that it was  not thereby\n\nagreeing  to recognize the union.  The union, in exchange for\n\nthe settlements, withdrew its  unfair labor practice charges,\n\nand the NLRB then withdrew the complaint.  \n\n     Negotiations between the union and the two hospitals did\n\nnot  prove  fruitful.   In October  1988,  the union  filed a\n\npetition  with  the  NLRB  seeking  to  have  the  settlement\n\nagreements  set  aside, and  the  pre-agreement unfair  labor\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\npractice  charges  reopened,  because  San   Rafael  had  not\n\ncomplied  with the settlement agreement.  In August 1989, the\n\ndistrict  court granted  a  preliminary injunction  requiring\n\nCentro  Medico to  bargain  in  good  faith, and  this  court\n\naffirmed.  See Asseo  v. Centro Medico del Turabo,  Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span>\r                                                                    \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st Cir. 1991).  \n\n     From the outset  in 1988, the new Centro Medico hospital\n\nclaimed  that it was free to alter working conditions at will\n\nand that it need not recognize the union.   Although most San\n\nRafael employees were hired  by the new hospital,  Suarez was\n\nnot.   Neither were four other employees who had been closely\n\nconnected  with union  activities and  acted at  one time  or\n\nanother  as  union stewards.   In  these  five cases  the new\n\nhospital  did  not formally  refuse  to  hire the  employees;\n\nseveral were told that  their applications were under review,\n\nbut  Centro  Medico then  took  no  official  action  on  the\n\napplications.\n\n     In  December  1989, the  union  filed  new unfair  labor\n\npractice charges.  These included charges that both hospitals\n\nhad failed to bargain in good faith and had engaged in unfair\n\nlabor practices  by refusing  to hire the  five union-related\n\nemployees.  A Board complaint was filed in February 1989.  On\n\nMay 4,  1989, an  administrative law  judge entered  an order\n\nconditionally  setting  aside   the  settlement   agreements,\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nreinstating the  old charges and consolidating  them with new\n\nones.  Hearings were held between May 1989 and May 1990.\n\n     On  June 19,  1991, the  ALJ found  that San  Rafael and\n\nCentro  Medico  were  alter   egos  and  comprised  a  single\n\nemployer;  alternatively, Centro  Medico  was found  to be  a\n\nsuccessor employer to San Rafael.  The ALJ found that the San\n\nRafael  settlement agreement  had  been entered  into in  bad\n\nfaith  and should  be permanently  set aside.   The  ALJ also\n\nfound that  the hospitals had violated their duty to bargain,\n\n29 U.S.C.    158(a)(5), and Centro  Medico's failure to  hire\n\nfour of the  five employees  was also found  to be  wrongful.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>   158(a)(3).\r               \n\n     On </span><pre class=\"inline\"> review, the  Board,  acting  through three  members,\n\nfound that the two hospitals were a single employer and alter\n\negos but  did not reach  the successor-employer  issue.   The\n\nBoard  agreed with the ALJ  that the hospitals had improperly\n\nfailed to bargain with  the union and that Centro  Medico had\n\nunilaterally changed employee working conditions.  Failure to\n\nrehire all five  employees was  found to be  improper.  By  a\n\ndivided vote, the  Board held that the San  Rafael settlement\n\nagreement was properly set aside.\n\n     The Board entered  a remedial order containing  specific\n\nprovisions designed to compel Centro Medico to bargain and to\n\nprovide redress for the five employees.  The Board order also\n\nbroadly   forbade  future   infringement  of   worker  rights\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nprotected under  \"section 7.\"   29 U.S.C.    157.   The Board\n\nthen filed in  this court the present application  to enforce\n\nits order.   29 U.S.C.    160(e).  The hospitals  opposed the\n\napplication.\n\n                             II.\n\n     In this court, the main issue raised by the hospitals is\n\nwhether  San  Rafael and  Centro  Medico can  be  treated for\n\npresent  purposes as if they were one  entity.  This issue is\n\ncritical  because  the   only  signed  collective  bargaining\n\nagreement is between the union and San Rafael.  Centro Medico\n\nis  required to  respect that  agreement, and  bargain before\n\nmaking  unilateral  changes  in working  conditions,  only if\n\nCentro  Medico is an extension  of San Rafael.   We therefore\n\nbegin  by describing  three different  but related  labor-law\n\ndoctrines considered by the agency.\n\n     One  concept,  known  colloquially  as  the   alter  ego\n\ndoctrine, says that in certain situations one employer entity\n\nwill  be regarded as a continuation of a predecessor, and the\n\ntwo will be treated  interchangeably for purposes of applying\n\nlabor laws.  The easiest  example is a case where the  second\n\nentity  is created by the owners of the first for the purpose\r                                                                         \n\nof  evading  labor  law  responsibilities;  but  identity  of\n\nownership, management, work force,  business and the like are\n\nalso  relevant.

As for  \"successor\" status,  any\n\nrelief available under this theory would be less far reaching\n\nthan that based on the alter ego theory.\n\n     In determining alter ego status, the NLRB and the courts\n\nhave, as  noted in  C.E.K., considered  a  range of  criteria\r                                      \n\nincluding the similarity between the old and new companies in\n\nrelation   to   management,   business  purpose,   operation,\n\nequipment, customers  and supervision, as well  as ownership.\n\nIn  most cases,  a  further important  factor in  determining\n\nalter  ego status is whether the alleged alter ego entity was\n\ncreated and  maintained in order to  avoid labor obligations.\n\nIn a rare discussion of the doctrine, the Supreme Court said:\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n          It is important to  emphasize that this is not\n     a  case where  the  successor  corporation  is  the\n     \"alter ego\" of the predecessor, where it is \"merely\n     a  disguised  continuance  of  the  old  employer.\"\n     Southport Petroleum Co. v.

In this case,\r                              \n\nthe ALJ set the settlement agreement aside on the ground that\n\nSan Rafael entered into it in bad faith and then breached the\n\nagreement.  The Board sustained this determination by  a two-\n\nto-one vote, one member dissenting on this issue alone.\n\n     We  review the findings  of the Board  only to determine\n\nwhether  they  are supported  by  substantial  evidence.   29\n\nU.S.C.   160(e).   The ALJ, whose rationale was  adopted in a\n\ncondensed form  by  the Board  majority,  said that  the  two\n\nhospitals had to know of  their own internal relationship and\n\ntherefore, knew or  should have known  their legal status  as\n\nalter egos; that the promise by San Rafael to bargain in good\n\nfaith therefore included a commitment to bargain on behalf of\n\nCentro  Medico; and  that  because San  Rafael resisted  that\n\nobligation  it  must  never  have  meant  to carry  out  this\n\nattributed commitment.\n\n     We think that this reasoning is unpersuasive and that no\n\nother evidence shows  that the agreement was entered  into in\n\nbad faith.  There is proof that San Rafael knew that it had a\n\nduty to  bargain for Centro  Medico.   The ALJ said  that San\n\nRafael  \"should  have known\"  of  its  prospective alter  ego\n\nstatus, but  we do not  see why.

It is sufficient\n\nto  say  that all  five  employees were  identified  with the\n\nunion,  no persuasive reason appears  why any of  them was so\n\nrefused  a position at the  new hospital, and  the excuses or\n\nevasions practiced by Centro  Medico in dealing with  each of\n\nthe five affirmatively suggests that discrimination was being\n\npracticed.
