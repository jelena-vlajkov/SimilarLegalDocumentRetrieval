This case concerns an alleged\r                                          \n\nwidespread  fraudulent  scheme,  involving  five  automobile body\n\nshops and two  insurance claims  adjusters.  The  purpose of  the\n\nscheme was to obtain payments on fraudulent insurance claims.  \n\n          Seven  appellants,  defendants  in  the   trial  court,\n\nchallenge on  numerous grounds the final judgment entered after a\n\njury  trial.   The  judgment was  for  Aetna Casualty  and Surety\n\nCompany (\"Aetna\") against\n\n          (a)  Betty   Arhaggelidis  on   the  theory   of  civil\n\nconspiracy in  the sum of $373,857.28 plus  interest from October\n\n2, 1989 to the date of entry of judgment;\n\n          (b)  the  Tirinkians  and  the  Markarians  (the   five\n\nindividual \"Arsenal defendants\") for $3,859,901.72 (consisting of\n\ndamages of  $789,967.24 trebled to $2,359,901.72  under 18 U.S.C.\n\n  1962(c)  and 1962(d)  of the  Racketeer Influenced  and Corrupt\n\nOrganizations  Act (\"RICO\"),  and costs,  expenses, disbursements\n\nand attorneys' fees  of $1,500,000.00) together with  prejudgment\n\ninterest from October 2, 1989 to the date of entry of judgment;\n\n          (c) three  of the Arsenal  defendants (Zareh Tirinkian,\n\nPeter  Markarian,   and  Jack  Markarian)  for   a  separate  and\n\nirreducible penalty of $1,579,934.48 under Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 93A\n\nin addition to the amount set forth in (b); and\n\n          (d)  Arsenal Auto  Repairs,  Inc.  (\"Arsenal Auto\"),  a\n\nseparate defendant in the action, for the sum of $789,967.24 on a\n\nclaim of civil conspiracy  plus interest from October 2,  1989 to\n\nthe date of entry of judgment.\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          For the reasons that follow,1 we affirm.\n\n                         I.   BACKGROUND\r                                   I.   BACKGROUND\n\n          We  begin this Opinion with  a summary of  facts as the\n\njury might  have found them;  we view  the evidence in  the light\n\nmost favorable to  the verdicts.   See United  States v.  Rivera-\r                                                                           \n\nSantiago, 872 F.2d  1073, 1078-79 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,  492\r                                                                     \n\nU.S. 910, (1989).\n\n          One of  the body  shops, Rodco/P&amp;B Autobody,  was owned\n\nand  operated  by  defendant  Petros Arhaggelidis,  who  has  not\n\nappealed  the judgment  against  him.    He  is  the  husband  of\n\nappellant  Betty Arhaggelidis.  She was the owner of two Mercedes\n\nupon which six fraudulent claims were made to Aetna.\n\n          Another  of  the  body  shops, Arsenal  Auto  (also  an\n\nappellant in  this action), was  owned and operated  by appellant\n\nZareh Tirinkian.  His wife, Lena Tirinkian, and her brothers John\n\nMarkarian  and Peter  Markarian  were employees  of Arsenal  Auto\n\nduring the period of the alleged fraudulent scheme.\n\n          Tarja Markarian  and her husband  Peter Markarian  were\n\nthe co-owners of a Mercedes upon which two fraudulent claims were\n\nmade to Aetna.\n\n          From  1987 to  1989, the  Arsenal defendants,  together\n                    \r                              \n\n1   The  published  version of  this  Opinion includes  only  the\nbackground statement  of facts (Part  I) and discussion  of those\nissues  that  may  be  of   general  interest  (Parts  II-IX  and\nConclusion).  The remaining portions of the Opinion (Parts X-XIV)\ncontain a detailed explanation of the sufficiency of the evidence\nto support the jury findings and address other issues that do not\nappear to have precedential importance.  See First Cir. R. 36.2.\r                                                      \n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nwith   employees  and   friends,  submitted   sixteen  fraudulent\n\ninsurance claims  to Aetna  involving luxury automobiles.   Aetna\n\npaid  $137,346.83 on these claims.   The Arsenal defendants filed\n\nat least  ten additional  fraudulent claims with  other insurance\n\ncompanies on the same group of  cars.  The Tirinkians submitted a\n\ntotal of  fifteen fraudulent claims  (seven to Aetna)  upon which\n\neither Lena or Tareh  Tirinkian was the claimant or  the insured.\n\nPeter and  Tarja Markarian submitted four  fraudulent claims (two\n\nto Aetna) on their Mercedes.  John Markarian, who filed no claims\n\nin his own name, was the  supervisor of repairs at Arsenal  Auto,\n\nwhere most of  the cars  involved in the  fraudulent claims  were\n\nstored and purportedly repaired.\n\n          Timothy Cummings and Steven Dexter were two of the many\n\nAetna  appraisers who covered the area where Arsenal Auto and the\n\nother body shops were located.  Either Cummings or Dexter did the\n\nappraisal  for  ten of  the  sixteen fraudulent  claims  that the\n\nArsenal  defendants  (personally  or  in cooperation  with  their\n\nfriends)  filed  over a  three-year  period  commencing in  1987.\n\nCummings  and  Dexter  submitted  false appraisals  to  help  the\n\nArsenal defendants defraud Aetna.\n\n          In the district court,  judgment was entered by default\n\nagainst Cummings and Dexter under RICO for $789,967.24 (being the\n\namount paid out  by Aetna  on 112 insurance  claims submitted  to\n\nAetna  that  the  jury   found  to  be  fraudulent)  trebled   to\n\n$2,359,901.72 plus interest at 12% per annum from October 2, 1989\n\non the  trebled amount, plus $1,500,000  in costs, disbursements,\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nand attorneys' fees.\n\n          For  each of  the  sixteen  fraudulent claims  directly\n\ninvolving  the  Arsenal defendants  and friends  cooperating with\n\nthem, Aetna, in accordance  with its business practices, required\n\na completed work form to be submitted by the claimant.  At trial,\n\nthe  Arsenal defendants  did not  provide any  documentation that\n\nArsenal  Auto or  any other  autobody shop  completed any  of the\n\nrepairs in  connection with any of  the claims.  With  respect to\n\nsome claims, the evidence shows  that the claimed accidents never\n\noccurred; in  other cases,  the claimed damage  was intentionally\n\ninflicted.  The jury  may have supportably inferred that  in some\n\ncases defective parts were placed on the cars for the purpose  of\n\nappraisal and then later replaced with the original parts.\n\n          The  jury found  that  each of  the individual  Arsenal\n\ndefendants  was liable  for  a substantive  RICO violation  under\n\n 1962(c)  for  participating in  the affairs  of Aetna  through a\n\npattern of racketeering activity.  The jury also found all of the\n\nindividual  Arsenal defendants liable,  under  1962(d),  for RICO\n\nconspiracy  with the  adjusters and the  operators of  other body\n\nshops  (not including Betty Arhaggelidis).\n\n          The judgment against the  Arsenal defendants was in the\n\nsame amount, and on  the same calculus, as that  against Cummings\n\nand Dexter, explained above.\n\n          Appellant  Betty Arhaggelidis  was associated  with the\n\nfraudulent  scheme through  her husband,  the owner  of Rodco/P&amp;B\n\nAutobody, one  of  the  five  autobody  shops  involved.    Betty\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nArhaggelidis owned  two Mercedes, one of which  was registered in\n\nher  mother's  name.   These two  Mercedes  were involved  in six\n\nfraudulent claims, as to all of which Cummings did the appraisal.\n\n The  jury found that she  was liable under  a \"civil conspiracy\"\n\ntheory  centered around  Rodco/P&amp;B  Autobody, and  therefore  was\n\nliable in connection with thirty-seven fraudulent claims.\n\n          The  appellants challenge the judgments entered against\n\nthem  on  a variety  of grounds.    In addition,  each appellant,\n\nexcept  for  Arsenal Auto  Repairs,  Inc.,  appeals the  district\n\ncourt's  denial of his or her motion  for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw because of insufficiency of the evidence.\n\n          First  we   consider  the  issues   arising  from   the\n\nrelationships  among the  RICO  counts and  the civil  conspiracy\n\ncount, then we consider other issues raised by one or more of the\n\nappellants.\n\n     II.  RELATIONSHIPS AMONG COUNTS OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT\r               II.  RELATIONSHIPS AMONG COUNTS OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\n          Appellants,  at various points,  both in  oral argument\n\nand in briefs before this court,  have seemed to suggest that the\n\njudgment against them in  this case is somehow flawed  because of\n\nsome  aspect of  the relationships  among the  different theories\n\nalleged and tried before  the jury.  We address  specific aspects\n\nof this suggestion in Part III, infra.  We address the suggestion\r                                               \n\nmore broadly here.\n\n          The district court  considered five different  theories\n\n(asserted in  five different  counts) that are  relevant to  this\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ninquiry:  three claims of RICO substantive violations, one  claim\n\nof RICO conspiracy, and one non-RICO conspiracy claim.\n\n               First.  Count  VII, a RICO substantive\r                              \n            violation  under    1962(c)  alleging  an\n            association-in-fact  enterprise.     This\n            theory was dismissed from the case in the\n            trial court.\n\n               Second.      Count   VIII,    a   RICO\r                               \n            substantive   violation  under    1962(c)\n            alleging  Aetna as  the enterprise.   The\n            jury  found that  this  claim was  proved\n            against     all    individual     Arsenal\n            appellants.\n\n               Third.   Count VI,  a RICO substantive\r                              \n            violation   under    1962(c),    alleging\n            Arsenal Auto as the enterprise.  The jury\n            found that this claim was  proved against\n            all individual Arsenal appellants.\n\n               Fourth.   Count  IX, alleging  a  RICO\r                                \n            conspiracy  under   1962(d).    The  jury\n            found that this  claim was proved against\n            all individual Arsenal appellants.\n\n               Fifth.    Count  X, common  law  civil\r                              \n            conspiracy.   The  jury found  that  this\n            claim   was   proved   against  all   the\n            appellants,  including  Arsenal Auto  and\n            Arhaggelidis.\n\n          The judgment against  the individual Arsenal appellants\n\njointly and severally in the amount of $2,359,901.72 is supported\n\nby  the  jury's  finding of  liability  on  Counts  VIII and  IX.\n\nTherefore,  if we determine that either the finding on Count VIII\r                                                 \n\nor  that on  Count IX  is supported  by sufficient  evidence, the\n\njudgment must  stand.  In fact, as we explain below, we find that\n\nthe  evidence was  sufficient  for the  jury  reasonably to  find\n\nliability on both Count VIII (the RICO substantive violation with\r                           \n\nAetna as the enterprise) and Count IX (the RICO conspiracy).\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          The Arsenal appellants do not challenge the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence in  support of the jury's finding of liability on\n\nCount VI or  on Count X.  The only  argument raised by appellants\n\nwith respect  to  Count  VI is  an  argument  regarding  pleading\n\ndeficiency  that  we have  rejected  as  wholly without  support.\n\nMoreover, because  we have  determined that the  judgment against\n\nthe individual  Arsenal appellants is supported  by jury findings\n\non Count VIII and Count IX, we have no reason to consider whether\n\nappellants are independently  liable under Count VI,  Count X, or\n\nboth.\n\n          The  judgment against Arsenal  Auto Repairs, Inc. which\n\nis also an  appellant in this action, is  supported by the jury's\n\nfinding of  liability on  Count X,  the civil conspiracy  theory.\n\nArsenal Auto has not challenged  the sufficiency of the  evidence\n\nsupporting the jury's finding with respect to its liability under\n\nCount X.   The judgment against Arsenal Auto is  affirmed for the\n\nreasons stated in other parts of this Opinion.\n\n          The   judgment   against   appellant  Arhaggelidis   is\n\nsupported  by the  jury's finding  of liability  on Count  X, the\n\ncivil  conspiracy theory.    We conclude  that  the evidence  was\n\nsufficient to support the  jury's finding against Arhaggelidis on\n\nCount X.\n\n          From this summary, it is clear that  one of appellants'\n\nassertions  is  true:    the  relationships  among  transactions,\n\ndefendants,  and  legal  claims  are  complex  both  legally  and\n\nfactually.   A question remains,  however, as to  how, if at all,\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nany of those complexities or all of them taken together bear upon\n\nany of the issues before this court on appeal.\n\n          Nowhere in the trial record, or in their  briefs before\n\nthis court, except in  a passage from their brief  that is quoted\n\nin  Part III, infra, and  an argument that  the consolidated case\r                             \n\nwas too  complex for a  jury to understand, App.  Brief at 59-61,\n\ndid the appellants ever  clearly formulate an argument or  set of\n\narguments based upon their hints and innuendos about complexity.\n\n          Nevertheless, we have read  with special care all parts\n\nof the briefs containing such hints or suggestions.  We have done\n\nso,  first, to  be certain  we have  not overlooked  any argument\n\npresented  and, second, to assure that we have taken into account\n\nany cited cases that  might bear upon the  issues presented by  a\n\nfact pattern  as  complex as  that before  us, with  interlocking\n\npersonal, family, and institutional relationships.\n\n          Entirely apart  from the complexities added  by RICO, a\n\nrisk of confusion has long existed because of relationships among\n\ndifferent legal and factual theories  of conspiracy that might be\n\ninvoked by the parties or  by a court.  The law bearing  upon the\n\npotential   consequences  of   invoking  different   theories  of\n\nconspiracy is  more extensively developed in  criminal cases than\n\nin  civil.  Even with  respect to the  criminal context, however,\n\nrelevant statutes  and precedents  provide only  limited guidance\n\nfor structuring factual and legal analysis.\n\n          In criminal  cases, issues arise often  with respect to\n\nwhether a case should be viewed as one involving:\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          (1)  a  single  conspiracy of  many  parties,  multiple\n\nobjectives, and broad sweep;\n\n          (2) multiple independent conspiracies; or\n\n          (3)  a  nest  of  interlocking  conspiracies  that  may\n\ninvolve  overlapping  conspiracies  or  smaller,  discrete  inner\n\nconspiracies  of fewer persons and smaller scope that are tied in\n\nwith a larger conspiracy  whose members include some but  not all\n\nof the members of the discrete inner conspiracies.\n\n            See, e.g., United States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d\r                                                       \n          855 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\nOne  result of  this  range of  possible  interpretations of  the\n\nevidence in a particular case is that a question concerning legal\n\ntheory and  arguments based upon it,  and concerning instructions\n\nexplaining the law to the jury, is difficult and \"is probably not\n\nsusceptible to an abstract answer unrelated to context.\"\n\n            United  States v. Oreto,  No. 91-1769, slip\r                                             \n          op. at 19 (1st Cir. Oct. 4, 1994).\n\n          The persons  alleged to be RICO  conspirators and civil\n\nconspirators in the present case, like those charged under a non-\n\nRICO conspiracy theory in Oreto\r                                         \n\n            have engaged in a series  of transactions\n            that could be viewed as a set of separate\n            conspiracies,  or one  overall conspiracy\n            embracing numerous wrongful transactions,\n            or .  . . both an  overarching conspiracy\n            and   a   nest   of  underlying   smaller\n            conspiracies.   Partly this  is a problem\n            of  proof  and   inference;  partly   the\n            problem  arises  from  trying to  squeeze\n            into  the  conceptual  cubbyhole  of  \"an\n            agreement\"  activities  that in  practice\n            often have the  more shapeless  character\n            of    an    evolving    joint    criminal\n            enterprise.\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n            Id.  at  20  (citations  and  reference  to\r                         \n          double jeopardy omitted);\n            see also  United  States v.

But  the choice,  in the  civil context\n\nalso, may  be burdened with  consequences -- a point  to which we\n\nreturn below.\n\n          In this  case, added  layers of complexity  incident to\n\nrelationships  among  theories exist,  not  only  because of  the\n\nrelationships  between different  conspiracy  counts --  Count IX\n\n(RICO  conspiracy) and  Count  X (civil  conspiracy) --  but also\n\nbecause of the  relationships among these  counts and the  counts\n\nalleging  RICO  substantive  violations (Counts  VII  and  VIII).\n\nAlso, as in criminal  cases, see, e.g., Oreto, No.  91-1769, slip\r                                                       \n\nop.  at 19, an answer as to  what significance, if any, the legal\n\nand factual theories may have, must be context sensitive.\n\n          Because procedural law allows  alternative contentions,\n\nparties to  a civil action involving such an array of factual and\n\nlegal  theories as  this case  presents may  be allowed  to defer\n\nchoice at least  until late  stages of proceedings  in the  trial\n\ncourt.   For example, both  plaintiffs and defendants  in a civil\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ncase may be allowed to maintain alternative contentions at  least\n\nuntil the evidence  is closed,  when the court  may require  some\n\nchoices  to be  made about  the  form of  verdict to  be used  in\n\nsubmitting the case to the jury -- see Fed.  R. Civ. P. 49 -- and\r                                                \n\nabout instructions  to the jury.   When a party does  not request\n\neither  a  \"special  question\"  or an  instruction  submitting  a\n\nparticular theory of conspiracy  to the jury, that party  makes a\n\nchoice that  has the  associated consequence of  almost certainly\n\nprecluding the assertion  after verdict of the  omitted theory of\n\nconspiracy.   See,  e.g.,  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. 49.    The  law  (a\r                           \n\nprocedural  rule, in  this instance)  allows choice,  but it  may\n\nlimit  the scope  of  choice by  defining  consequences that  are\n\nattached  to each of the  available options, rather than allowing\n\ncomplete  freedom of choice.   A  party making  a choice  of this\n\nkind, among legally defined options only, is making an \"election\"\n\nin the classic sense.  See John S. Ewart, Waiver  or Election, 29\r                                                                       \n\nHarv. L. Rev. 724 (1916).\n\n          Of  course, a  trial  court may  in some  circumstances\n\nallow  submission to  a  jury  of  two  or  more  theories,  with\n\nappropriate instructions explaining as to each theory the factual\n\nelements the jury must  find to return a verdict  sustaining that\n\ntheory.   The  different  theories submitted  to  a jury  may  be\n\nfactually  compatible  --  that  is,   a  verdict  sustaining all\n\ntheories  submitted  may  be  permissible.   Also,  however,  the\n\nevidence and the different theories of  conspiracy submitted to a\n\njury in a particular  case may be so factually  incompatible that\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nthe  jury's choice is  limited to finding  one or another  of the\n\ntheories supported, but not all.\n\n          In the present case, the trial judge, in submitting the\n\ncase to the jury, used a verdict form that at  first glance might\n\nappear  to  be  a  submission  on  \"special questions,\"  with  no\n\n\"general  verdict,\"   under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  49(a).    Closer\n\nexamination,  however, of both the verdict form and the record of\n\ncolloquies about  it, discloses  that the court  required only  a\n\ngeneral verdict of  the jury, under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 49(b), as to\n\neach claim  against each  defendant, after elimination  of claims\n\nthat were alleged but  as to which either the court  rejected the\n\nclaim  as a  matter  of law  (the association-in-fact  conspiracy\n\ntheory  alleged in  Count VII) or  Aetna elected  not  to request\n\nsubmission to the jury.\n\n          The  submission of  a separate  question requiring  the\n\njury to report  an answer as to  each of at least 122  of the 176\n\nallegedly  fraudulent  claims  was  necessary   because  disputed\n\nfactual issues were presented not only with respect to whether an\n\nalleged  RICO   conspiracy  and  the   alleged  RICO  substantive\n\nviolations existed, and, if so, what defendants were liable under\n\neach  theory,  but  also with  respect  to  whether  each of  the\n\ntransactions  was   within  the   scope  of  the   conspiracy  or\n\nsubstantive violation.  The  answers have a bearing on  the terms\n\nof  the judgment  to  be entered,  even  though the  trial  judge\n\ndetermined  (supportably,  we  have  concluded)  that no  genuine\n\ndispute of fact existed as to the amount paid by Aetna on each of\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nthe 112 claims the jury found to be fraudulent.\n\n          In summary, we conclude  that the verdicts and judgment\n\nfor  plaintiff  against  the  appellants  are  supported  by  the\n\nevidence received in this case, and by law.\n\n                    III.

With\n\nrespect to defendant Betty Arhaggelidis, the appellee argues that\n\nthe judgment in  the amount  of $373,857.28 is  supported by  the\n\njury finding that she was liable on a theory of civil conspiracy.\n\nWe examine the evidence supporting each of these theories against\n\neach defendant in Parts III.C, III.D, and III.E, infra.\r                                                                \n\n          B.   Appellants'  Preclusion  Argument  Based   on  the\r                                                                           \n\nRelationship of Count VII to Other Counts\r                                                   \n\n          The appellants challenge the district court's denial of\n\ntheir motion for  judgment as a matter of law  on Count VIII, the\n\nRICO  substantive charge  alleging Aetna  as the  enterprise, and\n\nCount IX, the RICO conspiracy charge.  They contend that once the\n\ndistrict  court  granted defendants'  motion  for  judgment as  a\n\nmatter  of  law  on Count  VII  (the  RICO substantive  violation\n\nalleging   an   association-in-fact   enterprise  including   all\n\ndefendants),  the  district  court  should  have  granted,  also,\n\ndefendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law on Counts VIII\n\nand  IX.  (This  argument was not  made in the  trial court as to\n\ndefendants' motion for judgment as a  matter of law on Count  VI,\n\nnor is it asserted on appeal.  Count VI, alleging Arsenal Auto as\n\nthe enterprise, alleges  a scheme  of a smaller  scope than  that\n\nalleged in Count VII.   Thus, no plausible  argument can be  made\n\nthat the court's dismissal of Count VII requires the dismissal of\n\nCount VI.)\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          Appellants do  not clearly state the  legal premises of\n\ntheir  preclusion argument.   Reading  generously to  appellants,\n\nhowever, to assure that we address any contention that might even\n\nplausibly be presented,  we infer that some asserted principle of\n\npreclusion is  at least  implicitly if not  explicitly suggested.\n\nFor example, appellants say:\n\n               The trial judge's  ruling directing  a\n            verdict for  all Defendants on  Count VII\n            of  the  Complaint,  because   there  was\n            \"insufficient  evidence to  sustain Count\n            7,    an   overall    association-in-fact\n            enterprise,\"  (App. 4092),  separated the\n            Arsenal   Defendants   from   the   other\n            Defendants  in  the   case  and   thereby\n            disassociated  [sic]  the actions  of the\n            Allston   Group  from  the  acts  of  the\n            Arsenal   Defendants.       Without   the\n            association-in-fact  enterprise  to  meld\n            the acts of  the various Defendants  into\n            an overall conspiracy,  the link  between\n            the  Arsenal  Defendants and  the Allston\n            Group was severed  thereby absolving  the\n            Arsenal  Defendants  from any  wrongdoing\n            concerning  bribery.  As  such, the trial\n            judge's ruling,  by implication, absolved\n            the Arsenal Defendants  from bearing  the\n            burden of the Allston Group's bribery.\n\nAppellants' Brief at 41-42.\n\n          It  is true  that  each of  Counts  VII, VIII,  and  IX\n\nalleges a  fraudulent scheme  that includes  all the  body shops.\n\nThese three theories have the same \"scope\" in the sense that each\n\nof them would support the judgment against the Arsenal individual\n\ndefendants in  the amount  of $2,369,901.72.   Nevertheless, each\n\ncount  asserts a  distinctive  theory,  and  none  of  the  three\n\ntheories has  all  of the  elements of  any other  of the  three.\n\nCounts  VII and  VIII  allege RICO  substantive violations  under\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n 1962(c),  but  the  entities   alleged  as  the  enterprise  are\n\ndifferent.  In contrast to these substantive violations, Count IX\r                                                      \n\nalleges a RICO conspiracy under  1962(d).\r                                   \n\n          Since  each  of  the  three  counts requires  different\n\nelements  of proof, the  appellants are  incorrect when  they say\n\nthat  the dismissal  of one  of these  counts, namely  Count VII,\n\nrequires the dismissal of one or both of the other two counts.\r                  \n\n          Although the appellants' argument  fails as a matter of\n\nlaw,  we  proceed  to  consider the  possibility  of  some  other\n\nimplicit premise that may  have led to such a  patently incorrect\n\nstatement of law.\n\n          One  premise  that  may  be  inferred  from appellants'\n\nargument  is  that  in  order  to  prove  Count  VIII,  the  RICO\n\nsubstantive violation with Aetna as the enterprise, the plaintiff\n\nhad to prove the  same relationships between the defendants  that\n\nwere essential  to the association-in-fact enterprise  alleged in\n\nCount VII.  This assumption is incorrect.\n\n          Section  1961 defines an  \"enterprise\" for the purposes\n\nof RICO to include \"any individual, partnership, corporation .  .\n\n. or other  legal entity, and  any union or group  of individuals\n\nassociated-in-fact  although  not a  legal  entity.\"   18  U.S.C.\n\n 1961(4).  Thus  to satisfy  the \"enterprise\" element  of a  RICO\n\nsubstantive violation, a plaintiff may prove either the existence\n\nof a  legal entity,  such as  a corporation, or  that a  group of\r                                                         \n\nindividuals  were   associated-in-fact.     Since   Aetna  is   a\n\ncorporation, Aetna can constitute an \"enterprise\" for the purpose\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nof Count VIII, even  if there is  no proof of an  association-in-\n\nfact enterprise.  \n\n          In   contrast,   Count  VII   requires   proof   of  an\n\nassociation-in-fact    enterprise.       An   association-in-fact\n\nenterprise   is   an   \"ongoing   organization,\"   with   members\n\n\"function[ing]  as a  continuing  unit,\" which  is \"separate  and\n\napart  from  the pattern  of racketeering  in which  it engages.\"\n\nUnited States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981).\r                                   \n\n          Since  no party  has  challenged  the district  court's\n\ngrant of the defendants' motion for  judgment as a matter of  law\n\non Count VII, we need not determine the precise elements required\n\nfor  a  plaintiff  to  prove  an  association-in-fact enterprise.\n\nNevertheless,  it is clear that an association-in-fact enterprise\n\nis  different from  an enterprise  that is  a legal  entity, like\n\nAetna.   Since different  proof is  required  to establish  these\n\ndifferent kinds of an enterprise, the  court's determination as a\n\nmatter of  law  in  favor  of the  defendants  on  Count  VII  is\n\nconsistent  with  the  court's  determination  that  fact  issues\n\nremained for the jury to decide with respect to Count VIII.\n\n          Another  possible  premise,  which  is  not  explicitly\n\narticulated  or acknowledged by the appellants,  is that in order\n\nto prove a RICO conspiracy of the scope alleged in  Count IX, the\n\nplaintiff was required to prove the existence  of an association-\n\nin-fact enterprise of that same scope.\n\n          This premise is  not valid.   Section 1962(d) does  not\n\nrequire  proof   of  an  association-in-fact   enterprise.    Any\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nenterprise meeting the definition of enterprise in  1961 will do.\n\nUnder  1961 an  enterprise may include a  legitimate legal entity\n\nlike  Aetna as  the victim  of the  racketeering activity.   This\n\ncourt has  previously upheld convictions under  both  1962(c) and\n\n 1962(d), that alleged a victim enterprise like Aetna.\n\n            See United States  v. Boylan, 898  F.2d 230\r                                                  \n          (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849 (1990)\r                                            \n          (victim  enterprise  was  the  Boston  Police\n          Department).\n\nTherefore, in order to  satisfy the enterprise element of  a RICO\n\nconspiracy of the scope alleged in Count IX, the plaintiff needed\n\nonly  to prove  some  kind  of  enterprise  of  that  scope,  not\n\nnecessarily an  association-in-fact enterprise.   In the  case at\n\nhand,  proving a RICO conspiracy with Aetna as the enterprise was\n\nsufficient.\n\n          For these reasons, the trial judge's ruling as a matter\n\nof law for  defendants on Count VII, based on the conclusion that\n\nthere was not  enough evidence to go to the jury on the theory of\n\nan  \"association-in-fact\" enterprise, is entirely consistent with\n\nthe jury findings of a  1962(c) substantive violation (with Aetna\n\nas the  victim enterprise)  and of  a   1962(d) conspiracy  (with\n\nAetna as the victim enterprise).\n\n          C.   Substantive  RICO  Violation  Under  1962(c)  with\r                                                                           \n\nAetna as the Enterprise -- Count VIII\r                                               \n\n          For  an individual  defendant to  be liable for  a RICO\n\nsubstantive   violation  under   1962(c),   with  Aetna   as  the\n\nenterprise,  the evidence must be sufficient for the jury to find\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nthat (1) Aetna was an enterprise affecting interstate or  foreign\n\ncommerce, (2)  that the defendant under  consideration associated\n\nwith the enterprise, (3) that this defendant participated  in the\n\nconduct  of   the  enterprise's   affairs,  and  (4)   that  this\n\ndefendant's participation  was through a  pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity.  28 U.S.C.  1962(c).\n\n          We  consider, whether  the evidence  was  sufficient to\n\nprove each of these  elements against each of the  defendants the\n\njury found liable under Count VIII.\n\n          First  Element.     Aetna is  an \"enterprise  affecting\r                                   \n\ninterstate commerce\" within  the meaning of  1962(c).   The major\n\npurpose  of RICO  is to  protect legitimate  business enterprises\n\nfrom infiltration by  racketeers.  \"Enterprise\"  as used in  this\n\nact,  includes legitimate  corporations.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \n\nTurkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct.  2524 (1981).  Since Aetna is a\r                  \n\nmajor  property  and  casualty  insurer doing  business  in  many\n\nstates,  Aetna's  conduct  of  its business  \"affects  interstate\n\ncommerce.\"\n\n            See   United    States   v.   South-Eastern\r                                                                 \n          Underwriters  Ass'n, 322  U.S. 533  (1944) (a\r                                       \n          fire  insurance  company   that  conducts   a\n          substantial part of its business transactions\n          across  state lines  is engaged  in \"commerce\n          among  the several states\"  and is subject to\n          regulation under the Commerce Clause).\n\n          Appellants  argue  that  Aetna  cannot  constitute  the\n\n\"enterprise\" because the alleged racketeering  activities were to\n\nthe detriment and not the benefit of Aetna.   This argument rests\n\non a misinterpretation of the RICO statute.  The statute does not\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nrequire that the pattern of racketeering be in furtherance of the\n\nenterprise.   In United States  v. Boylan, this  court upheld the\r                                                   \n\nconvictions  of Boston  police  detectives who  violated RICO  by\n\nillegally  participating  in the  affairs  of  the Boston  Police\n\nDepartment (the enterprise), through a pattern of racketeering by\n\naccepting bribes.   Boylan, 898 F.2d 230.  In  Boylan, as in this\r                                                               \n\ncase,  the  affairs  of the  enterprise  were  undermined by  the\n\nillegal activity.\n\n            See also Yellow Bus  Lines, Inc. v.

Appellants, who are  not employees of\r                                   \n\nAetna,  attempt to  distinguish Boylan  by pointing  out that  in\r                                                \n\nBoylan  the defendants  were employees  of the  organization that\r                \n\nconstituted  the  RICO enterprise.    Appellants  argue that  the\n\nstatute  prohibits  employees   from  conducting  an enterprise's\n\naffairs  through  a  pattern  of  racketeering  activity  to  the\n\ndetriment  of the enterprise,  but does not  prohibit persons who\n\nare  merely associated  with the  enterprise from  conducting the\n\nenterprise's  affairs  to  its  detriment through  a  pattern  of\n\nracketeering activity.\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\n          The  proposed  distinction  is  not  supported  by  the\n\nlanguage of the  statute, which refers to  \"person[s] employed by\n\nor associated with  any enterprise.\" 18 U.S.C.   1962(c)(emphasis\r                            \n\nadded).  Nor is it supported by any identifiable public policy or\n\nby precedent.\n\n            See, e.g., United States v. Yonan, 800 F.2d\r                                                       \n          164 (7th Cir.  1986) cert.  denied, 479  U.S.\r                                                      \n          1055 (1987)(upholding conviction of attorney,\n          who was not an  employee of the enterprise, a\n          prosecutor's  office,  for violating  RICO by\n          conducting  the  affairs of  the prosecutor's\n          office through bribery);\n            United States v. Bright, 630 F.2d 804, 830-\r                                             \n          31 (5th Cir. 1980) (upholding RICO conviction\n          of a  bail bondsmen, who was  not an employee\n          of  the enterprise,  a sheriff's  office, for\n          unlawfully  participating  in the  affairs of\n          the enterprise through bribery).\n\n          Appellants also  argue that  the  defendants cannot  be\n\nheld  liable for a RICO  substantive violation with  Aetna as the\n\nenterprise  because  they  were  not  even  \"associates\"  of  the\n\nenterprise, but were  outsiders and, as  outsiders, could not  be\n\nsaid  to \"have participated  in the conduct\"  of Aetna's affairs.\n\nThis is  an argument more of  words than substance.   The statute\n\nuses the phrase \"associated with\" rather than creating a category\n\nof \"associates,\"  narrowly defined to include  fewer persons than\n\nthose who may  be said to have \"associated with\" an enterprise in\n\na broader sense of this phrase.  In ordinary usage,  one who, for\n\nexample, buys an insurance policy from an  enterprise and depends\n\non  the solidarity  of  that enterprise,  for protection  against\n\ndefined risks, has an association  with, and may be said to  have\n\n\"associated with,\" the enterprise.\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\n          Each of the individual appellants was either an insured\n\nor a claimant under an Aetna policy, or an owner or operator of a\n\nbody  shop involved  in repairing  automobiles insured  by Aetna.\n\nThree of  the five individual Arsenal  appellants (the Tirinkians\n\nand Peter Markarian)  were both  insureds and operators.   As  an\n\ninsured,  a  claimant,  or a  body  shop  operator,  each of  the\n\nappellants was in  a contractual  relationship with  Aetna.   The\n\nbody shop (also an  appellant) and its owners and  operators were\n\n\"associated  with\"  Aetna  because  each body  shop  about  which\n\nevidence  was received at trial was a place where Aetna employees\n\nconducted  appraisals and  where cars  that were  the subject  of\n\ninsurance were purportedly repaired.\n\n          Third Element.   Appellants  argue  that no  reasonable\r                                 \n\njury could have found  that the appellants \"participated directly\n\nor indirectly in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs\" because\n\nthe  defendants   did  not  \"participate  in   the  operation  or\n\nmanagement  of the enterprise itself.\"   Reves v.  Ernst &amp; Young,\r                                                                          \n\n113 S.Ct. 1163 (1993).\n\n          Contrary   to  the  appellants'  assertion,  there  was\n\nsufficient  evidence  for a  reasonable  jury  to find  that  the\n\ndefendants'  activities  met  the definition  of  \"participation\"\n\nadopted by the  Supreme Court  in Reves,  which is  known as  the\r                                                 \n\n\"operation  or  management\"  test.    Id.  at 1172.    Appraising\r                                                   \n\nallegedly  damaged vehicles  and  investigating, processing,  and\n\npaying  automobile insurance  claims are  vital parts  of Aetna's\n\nbusiness.  By acting with purpose to cause Aetna to make payments\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\non false claims, appellants were participating in the \"operation\"\n\nof Aetna.\n\n          The  Supreme  Court  in  Reves interpreted  the  phrase\r                                                  \n\n\"conduct of the  enterprise's affairs\" to  indicate a \"degree  of\n\ndirection,\"  which the court  described as  taking \"some  part in\n\ndirecting  the enterprise's affairs.\"  Id. at 1170.  The evidence\r                                                    \n\nwas sufficient to support  a finding that the  individual Arsenal\n\ndefendants'  activities  affected,  in  a  material  degree,  the\n\ndirection of Aetna's affairs by  employees of Aetna.  Appellants'\n\nactivities caused Aetna  employees having authority  to do so  to\n\ndirect that  other employees make payments  Aetna otherwise would\n\nnot have  made.  The Court  in Reves emphasized that,  as in this\r                                              \n\ncase, the defendants' \"participation\"  could be \"indirect\" in the\n\nsense  that persons with no formal position in the enterprise can\n\nbe held liable under   1962(c) for \"participating in the  conduct\n\nof the enterprise's affairs.\"   Id.  The evidence  was sufficient\r                                             \n\nto  support a finding that each of the appellants participated in\n\nthe conduct of Aetna's affairs in this way.\n\n          Moreover, in Reves the court expressly recognized  that\r                                      \n\n\"an  enterprise  also might  be  operated  or managed  by  others\n\n'associated with'  the enterprise who  exert control over  it as,\n\nfor example, by bribery.\"  Id. at 1173.  When viewed in the light\r                                        \n\nmost favorable to  the plaintiff,  in support of  the verdict  in\n\nthis case, the evidence supports a finding that appellants caused\n\nthe Aetna appraisers  to approve false  claims and conduct  their\n\nappraisals in a manner contrary to Aetna's business practices and\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\ncaused Aetna to pay out large sums of money on false claims.  The\n\nevidence  was sufficient  to  support a  finding that  appellants\n\nexerted  control over  the  enterprise, if  not  by bribery  (the\n\nexample  given by  the Court  in Reves), then  at least  by other\r                                                \n\nmethods of inducement.   Since a reasonable jury could  find that\n\nthe appellants exerted some  control over Aetna and took  part in\n\ndirecting   some  aspect   of  the   enterprise's   affairs,  the\n\nappellants'  actions  could  be   found  to  have  satisfied  the\n\n\"operation or management\" test.\n\n          Fourth Element.  The final element necessary to support\r                                   \n\nliability  under  1962(c) is  that each defendant's participation\n\nwas  \"through a pattern of  racketeering activity.\"   In order to\n\nestablish a  pattern of racketeering activity,  the evidence must\n\nshow  that  each defendant  committed  two  acts of  racketeering\n\nactivity  within the span of  ten years.   The predicate acts are\n\ndefined by 18 U.S.C.  1961 to include mail fraud, wire fraud, and\n\nbribery as well as aiding and abetting these offenses.\n\n            See Oreto,  No.  91-1769, slip  op.  at  27\r                               \n          (jury  could find  a pattern  of racketeering\n          activity for the purposes of  1962(c) if  the\n          appellants aided and  abetted the  commission\n          of at least two predicate acts);\n            see also Pereira v.

Liability on this theory is proved against a defendant\n\nby showing  (1) the existence of  enterprise affecting interstate\n\ncommerce, (2) that the  defendant knowingly joined the conspiracy\n\nto participate in the  conduct of the affairs of  the enterprise,\n\n(3) that the defendant participated in the conduct of the affairs\n\nof  the enterprise, and (4)  that the defendant  did so through a\n\npattern of racketeering  activity by  agreeing to  commit, or  in\n\nfact committing, two or more predicate offenses.

In arriving at\n\nthis formulation, we have been sensitive to the fact that earlier\n\ncases in  this  circuit used  the  phrase \"knowingly  joined  the\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nenterprise.\"\n\n            United States v.

(\"Our inquiry thus  reduces to whether\r                         \n          such  a conspiracy,  knowingly joined  by all\n          defendants, was satisfactorily proven.\").\n\nIn  Boylan  (and  perhaps  the  earlier   cases  as  well),  this\r                    \n\ndifference in phrasing was immaterial to the outcome of the case.\n\nThis  was so in Boylan  because the evidence  was undisputed that\r                                \n\nall  of the defendants alleged to have joined the conspiracy were\n\nindisputably  employees  of  the  Boston  Police  Department, the\n\nalleged  enterprise.   In the  present case,  on the  other hand,\n\nplaintiff alleged that defendants who were not employees of Aetna\n\n(the enterprise  in Count VIII) knowingly  joined the conspiracy.\n\nFor this reason we have addressed the issue more precisely in our\n\nformulation, stated above, of the elements  of a RICO conspiracy,\n\nas applied to this case.\n\n          We  conclude that  the issue  we must  consider is  not\n\nwhether the defendants knowingly joined the victim enterprise (as\n\nfirst  phrased in Boylan) but  (as later stated  in that Opinion)\r                                  \n\nwhether  the  defendants  knowingly  joined  a  conspiracy.    We\n\nconclude that  the evidence  is sufficient  to support a  finding\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\nthat each of the appellants \"knowingly joined\" the  1962(d)  RICO\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          The alleged   1962(d) RICO conspiracy (Count  IX) was a\n\nconspiracy  to violate  1962(c).   The major difference between a\n\nviolation of  1962(c) itself (such as Count VIII) and a violation\n\nof  1962(d) based on  1962(c)(such as Count IX) is the additional\n\nrequired element that the defendant knowingly joined a conspiracy\n\nto violate  1962(c).  Another difference is that, to prove that a\n\ndefendant violated  1962(c), it is necessary for the plaintiff to\n\nprove two  predicate offenses; under  1962(d),  in contrast, this\n\nis not an element required to be proved.  To prove a violation of\n\n 1962(d), it is enough to prove that a defendant agreed with  one\r                                                                 \n\nor more others  that two  predicate offenses be  committed.   See\r                                                                           \n\nBoylan, 898  F.2d  at 252.    In the  present case,  this  latter\r                \n\ndifference  is of  no practical  consequence because  we conclude\n\nthat there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that each\n\ndefendant in fact committed two predicate offenses.\n\n          One  assertion,  perhaps  implicit in  the  appellants'\n\nargument,  is that, in order  to prove each  defendant liable for\n\nRICO   conspiracy  (a   1962(d)  violation),  the  plaintiff  was\n\nrequired to prove  a conspiracy to defraud Aetna in which each of\n\nthe  Arsenal  defendants  conspired  directly with  one  or  more\n\npersons associated with each of the other body shops.\n\n          This   assertion  is   incorrect  because   it  depends\n\nnecessarily upon a misinterpretation  of  1962(d) with respect to\n\nthe  elements necessary to prove  a RICO conspiracy.   It is true\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\nthat to find a defendant liable under  1962(d) one must find that\n\nthe defendant conspired to  violate a subsection of  1962.  It is\n\nnot  necessary, however, to find that each defendant knew all the\n\ndetails  or  the full  extent  of the  conspiracy,  including the\n\nidentity and role of every other conspirator.\n\n            Boylan, 898 F.2d at 242 (\"A RICO conspiracy\r                            \n          does  not demand  . .  . that  all defendants\n          participate in all racketeering acts, know of\n          the  entire  conspiratorial   sweep,  or   be\n          acquainted with all other defendants.\")\n\n          All that is necessary to prove this element of the RICO\n\nconspiracy, against  a particular defendant, is to  prove that he\n\nor  she agreed with one or more co-conspirators to participate in\n\nthe   conspiracy.    Moreover,  it  is   not  necessary  for  the\n\nconspiratorial agreement to  be express, so long as its existence\n\ncan  plausibly   be  inferred   from  words,  actions,   and  the\n\ninterdependence  of  activities  and persons  involved.    United\r                                                                           \n\nStates v.  Concemi, 957 F.2d 942,  950 (1st Cir. 1992).   In this\r                            \n\ncase,  the jury reasonably  could have found  that, although each\n\ndefendant  may not have known the entire sweep of the conspiracy,\n\neach  defendant  knew that  he  or she  was  a part  of  a larger\n\nfraudulent scheme.   For example, since the  evidence supported a\n\nfinding that each of the Arsenal defendants was well aware of the\n\nfraudulent business  practices of  Dexter and Cummings,  the jury\n\ncould find that all of the Arsenal defendants knew they were part\n\nof a larger conspiracy  in which other persons made  uses similar\n\nto their own  of fraudulent  appraisals by  Dexter, Cummings,  or\n\nboth.\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\n          A   defendant   who   does   not   know   the   \"entire\n\nconspiratorial  sweep\"  is  nevertheless  jointly  and  severally\n\nliable, in the civil context, for all acts  in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.  Using a  common metaphor, one may say  that Cummings\n\nand Dexter, the Aetna appraisers, were  at the hub of the overall\n\nRICO conspiracy,  providing the  central point through  which all\n\nthe defendant body shops were connected.  A jury could reasonably\n\nfind that, through Cummings  and Dexter, the conspiratorial sweep\n\nextended  to all  the body  shops  and most,  if not  all of  the\n\nindividual defendants.  The jury in this case found that the RICO\n\nconspiracy included all other appellants, except for Arsenal Auto\n\nRepairs,  Inc. and  Betty  Arhaggelidis.   We  need not  consider\n\nwhether the evidence would have supported a finding against these\n\ntwo appellants as well.  That was not  essential to the liability\n\nof  others under this theory,  nor to the  liability of these two\n\nappellants under a different theory.\n\n          From evidence  of the  extensive dealings of  all other\n\nappellants with Cummings and Dexter, the jury could have inferred\n\nan  agreement,  to  defraud  Aetna,  among  all  of  the  Arsenal\n\ndefendants (Arhaggelidis not being  an Arsenal defendant) and the\n\nappraisers.    Through  evidence   of  each  individual   Arsenal\n\ndefendant's actions, the jury could infer that each defendant had\n\nthe  requisite state of mind  for a RICO  conspiracy violation --\n\nknowing participation.\n\n            See   Boylan,  898   F.2d  at   242  (\"[The\r                                  \n          plaintiff]  may  prove  [a  RICO  conspiracy]\n          through the use  of circumstantial  evidence,\n          so  long as  the  total  evidence,  including\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\n          reasonable   inferences,  is   sufficient  to\n          warrant [the jury's findings].\").\n\n          The appellants do not  dispute that Dexter and Cummings\n\nconspired  with the owners and operators of the other body shops.\n\nThrough Dexter  and Cummings, the Arsenal  defendants were linked\n\nto  all the  other  defendants who  were  found liable  for  RICO\n\nconspiracy.   Thus, upon proof  that each defendant  committed or\n\nagreed  to  the  commission   of  two  predicate  offenses,  each\n\ndefendant could be held liable for the overall RICO conspiracy.\n\n          Moreover,   although  it  was  not  necessary  for  the\n\nplaintiff to  prove that the Arsenal defendants knew the identity\n\nof defendants from  the other body  shops and conspired  directly\n\nwith them, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to infer that\n\nthis  was in  fact  the  case.    For  example,  Zareh  Tirinkian\n\ntestified that  he frequently  attended parties and  other social\n\nengagements with the operators of the other body shops.  Although\n\nTirinkian denied  discussing his  practice  of filing  fraudulent\n\ninsurance claims with  the other body  shop owners, the  evidence\n\nshowed  that   the  body  shops'  racketeering   activities  were\n\nunusually similar.   The  body shops  all  defrauded Aetna,  they\n\nreported nearly  identical types  of fraudulent claims,  and they\n\nobtained  appraisals from the same appraisers.  Evidence of these\n\nsimilarities,   considered  along   with   other  evidence,   was\n\nsufficient to  support a jury finding that the owners of the body\n\nshops conspired directly with one another.\n\n            Id. at 242 (a jury may infer that  a single\r                         \n          overall conspiracy existed  when evidence  of\n          racketeering   acts   shows   \"hallmarks   of\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\n          similarity\"  and  \"a  significant  degree  of\n          interconnectedness\").\n\n          E.

The judgment against Arsenal Auto\n\nrests instead, upon  the jury's  finding that Arsenal  Auto   was\n\nliable  for  civil conspiracy.   The  appellants' brief  does not\n\nchallenge this  finding  against Arsenal  Auto  on the  basis  of\n\ninsufficiency of  the evidence.   For this reason,  the following\n\ndiscussion  of  civil conspiracy  concerns  Arhaggelidis's appeal\n\nonly.\n\n          Appellant Arhaggelidis challenges the  judgment entered\n\nagainst  her for civil conspiracy  on the ground of insufficiency\n\nof  the evidence.   The plaintiff  alleged that  Ms. Arhaggelidis\n\nconspired  with  her  fellow  Rodco/P&amp;B  Autobody  defendants  to\n\ndefraud Aetna.\n\n          The  nature  of  a  \"civil conspiracy\"  and  the  proof\n\nrequired to invoke  this type of claim  differ significantly from\n\nthose  applying to  criminal conspiracies  generally and  to RICO\n\nconspiracies in  particular.  Under Massachusetts  law, either of\n\ntwo possible causes of action may be called \"civil conspiracy.\"\n\n          First.

In any  event, she\n\nwould be precluded from doing so here, not having objected to the\n\ninstruction in the district court.  Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 51.\n\n          She  did, however,  challenge  the  sufficiency of  the\n\nevidence  by her  motion for  judgment as  a matter  of law.   We\n\nconclude, nevertheless,  that we  need not determine  the precise\n\nstate of Massachusetts  law on concerted action  in tort, because\n\nunder  any plausible  formulation  of Massachusetts  law, a  jury\n\nreasonably could  find that  Betty Arhaggelidis acted  in concert\n\nwith  her  husband and  fellow  Rodco/P&amp;B  Autobody defendant  to\n\ndefraud Aetna.\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\n          The  jury,   with  support  in  evidence,   found  that\n\nRodco/P&amp;B  Autobody was  associated with  thirty-seven fraudulent\n\nclaims that were submitted to Aetna, and that  Betty Arhaggelidis\n\nwas directly involved in six of those claims.\n\n          From the  evidence at trial, the  jury reasonably could\n\nfind  also that  Ms.  Arhaggelidis \"acted  in  concert\" with  her\n\nhusband, the owner  of Rodco/P&amp;B Autobody,  pursuant to a  common\n\ndesign.  All  six claims  with which she  was connected  involved\n\nclaimed damage  purportedly repaired at Rodco/P&amp;B  Autobody.  All\n\nsix  claims were supported by  appraisals by Mr.  Cummings, a co-\n\ndefendant.  Her husband, Petros Arhaggelidis,  allegedly repaired\n\nmany  of the  cars personally.   Evidence  was received  that she\n\nrepresented  to  Aetna that  the repairs  had  been made.   Also,\n\nevidence  was received of other fraudulent conduct on the part of\n\nMr. Arhaggelidis:  he  was a claimant on several  claims the jury\n\nfound  to be  fraudulent, and  he made  payments to  Mr. Cummings\n\ntotalling  over $35,000, which the jury could have inferred to be\n\nbribes.   From the evidence as  a whole, the jury  could infer an\n\nagreement between Betty Arhaggelidis and her husband, under which\n\nthey played different roles, but nevertheless acted together with\n\na common design to defraud Aetna.\n\n              IV.  SUBMISSION OF CLAIMS TO THE JURY\r                        IV.  SUBMISSION OF CLAIMS TO THE JURY\n\n          The Arsenal appellants  argue that only  sixteen claims\n\ninvolving the  Arsenal defendants  should have been  submitted to\n\nthe  jury,  instead  of  the thirty-three  claims  involving  the\n\nArsenal  defendants on which evidence  was heard.  The appellants\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\ncorrectly assert  that only sixteen of  these thirty-three claims\n\nwere made to Aetna; the other seventeen claims were made to other\n\ninsurance  companies  (except   for  Tareh  Tirinkian's  worker's\n\ncompensation claim).\n\n          Aetna  recovered  damages  for  the  sixteen automobile\n\ninsurance claims  paid by Aetna  -- claims the  jury found  to be\n\nfraudulent.    The trial  court  admitted evidence  of  the other\n\nseventeen claims  because each was relevant  to the determination\n\nof fraud with respect to one  or more of the sixteen Aetna claims\n\nat issue.   For  example, many of  the claims to  other insurance\n\ncompanies duplicated  one or more of the claims to Aetna.  In one\n\nor more  instances, damage that  was allegedly  sustained in  one\n\naccident  was later reported to  Aetna in connection with another\n\nalleged accident.  On this appeal we need  not decide whether the\n\ndistrict   court   was   correct  in   admitting   the   evidence\n\ncorresponding to  each of the seventeen  claims because, although\n\nin  some instances the appellants objected to the introduction of\n\nthis  evidence  at trial,  their briefs  in  this court  have not\n\ndirectly challenged these rulings of the district court.\n\n          Instead, the  appellants argue  that  the verdict  form\n\nshould not have asked the jury to determine whether each of these\n\nseventeen  other claims was fraudulent.   We will assume, without\n\ndeciding, that the trial court's inclusion in the verdict form of\n\nquestions about these seventeen claims was unnecessary because at\n\nmost they concerned findings of an evidentiary nature rather than\n\nfindings on  ultimate issues of  fact that had  to be decided  to\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\ndetermine  whether  each element  of  some claim  or  defense was\n\nproved.   Since the appellants do  not even articulate grounds of\n\nan  argument for prejudicial error, however,  much less show that\n\nthey  were in  fact prejudiced  in any way  by the  submission of\n\nthese  seventeen other insurance claims  to the jury,  we have no\n\noccasion to determine whether their submission was improper.  The\n\ntrial  court  did consider  and  reject  the Arsenal  defendants'\n\narguments  that  they  were  prejudiced  by  the  jury's  hearing\n\nevidence  of these seventeen claims.  The trial court allowed the\n\nevidence  because  it tended  to support  a  finding of  a common\n\npattern and scheme of fraud that the  jury might find extended to\n\nall the Aetna  claims and others as well.   Even assuming that an\n\nissue   regarding  admissibility  of  the  evidence  is  properly\n\npreserved for our consideration, we conclude that this ruling was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion.  Nor was it an abuse of discretion to\n\nsubmit to the jury questions about these claims.  It is true that\n\nthe jury's findings with respect to the seventeen other insurance\n\nclaims were not essential to the judgment entered on the verdict.\n\nWe  note, however,  that an  argument can  be made,  although the\n\nappellee  does not advance  it on appeal  (and need not  do so in\n\nview of other findings), that each  of these claims, if found  to\n\nconstitute  mail fraud, would constitute  a predicate act for the\n\npurposes of Count VI, the substantive RICO violation with Arsenal\n\nAuto as the enterprise.   For example, one  could argue that  two\n\nrelated, fraudulent  claims, although one was  submitted to Aetna\n\nand  one  was  submitted  to  another  insurance  company,  would\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\nconstitute a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" through which the\n\ndefendantsparticipated inthe conductof theaffairs ofArsenal Auto.\n\n          In considering the sufficiency of evidence, we need not\n\naddress the merits of such an argument because even when limiting\n\nthe scope  of our  review of  the evidence  to the  sixteen Aetna\n\ninsurance claims, we find  that there was sufficient evidence  to\n\nsupport the finding that each of  the Arsenal defendants violated\n\nRICO  1962(c) by  committing two related, predicate acts  of mail\n\nfraud.\n\n        V.  UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:  MASS GEN. L. CH. 93A\r                  V.  UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:  MASS GEN. L. CH. 93A\n\n          Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  93A prohibits \"unfair  or deceptive\n\nacts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"  Mass\n\nGen. L. ch.  93A  2.  The statute provides  for treble damages in\n\nthe  case of a willful violation of  the statute.  The jury found\n\nthat  Zareh  Tirinkian,  Jack  Markarian,  and  Peter Markarian's\n\ndeceptive business practices  constituted a willful  violation of\n\nthis statute.\n\n          Appellants contend that their  dealings with Aetna were\n\npurely  personal and  that  they did  not  violate this  statute,\n\nbecause they did not deal with Aetna in a business context.\n\n          Appellants are  correct  in asserting  that the  phrase\n\n\"persons  engaged in . . . trade or commerce\" refers specifically\n\nto  individuals acting  in a  business context.   See  Lantner v.\r                                                                        \n\nCarson, 373 N.E.2d 973 (Mass. 1978).  Contrary to the appellants'\r                \n\nassertions, however, the evidence was sufficient for the  jury to\n\nfind that  these  three  defendants were  acting  in  a  business\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\ncontext and engaged in unfair or deceptive business practices  in\n\nviolation of this statute.\n\n          All three defendants were  involved in the Arsenal Auto\n\nbusiness:   Zareh  Tirinkian  was an  owner  and Jack  and  Peter\n\nMarkarian performed  repair  work.   The jury  found that  family\n\nmembers  and  friends of  these  defendants submitted  fraudulent\n\nclaims to Aetna for damages.   Most of these cars  were appraised\n\nby  Aetna appraisers, and most  of the repair  work was allegedly\n\nperformed at Arsenal  Auto.   Many of the  work completion  forms\n\nsubmitted  to Aetna with respect  to these claims  bear the stamp\n\n\"Arsenal  Auto Repairs,\" certifying  that Arsenal  Auto completed\n\nthe repair work.\n\n          Under  Massachusetts law, \"unfair and deceptive acts or\n\npractices\" include acts of fraud.\n\n            See Evans v. Yegen Associates, Inc., 556 F.\r                                                         \n          Supp. 1219,  1227  (D.

From\n\nthe  evidence before them, the  jury could find  that these three\n\ndefendants used  deceptive business practices  in their  dealings\n\nwith Aetna in violation of Mass. Gen.

Ernst &amp; Young, 113 S.Ct. 1163 (1993).\r                                                 \n\n          The appellants are  precluded from successfully  making\n\nthis  argument on appeal, however, since they failed to object on\n\nthis ground at  trial.

Although the\n\nappellants contend  that they  objected to this  instruction, the\n\nmost that can be said is that they objected to the \"RICO -- Aetna\n\nas the enterprise\" charge on  the ground that Aetna could  not be\n\nthe enterprise  as a matter of  law.  See App. 4833.   The record\r                                                   \n\nshows that the court did not interpret this to be an objection to\n\nany  jury instruction, but merely further  argument in support of\n\ntheir  motion for  judgment as a  matter of  law.

Following the jury trial and  jury\n\nverdict on the issues  of liability, the district  court properly\n\ndetermined  that no  genuine disputes  of material  fact remained\n\nwith respect to damages.\n\n          The appellants' challenge fails because, after the jury\n\nverdict, damages could be determined purely \"as a matter of law,\"\n\nin  the sense  that reasonable  factfinders applying  the correct\n\nlegal  standard could  come to  but one  determination as  to the\n\namount  of damages  to be  awarded under  the jury's  findings on\n\nliability.\n\n          Precedents  regarding  summary judgment  provide useful\n\nguidance  on issues arising after jury verdict in the first phase\n\nof a phased trial such as occurred in this case.\n\n          In the pretrial context,  regardless of any jury demand\n\nmade  by  the parties,  summary  judgment  is warranted  when  no\n\ntriable fact issues have been identified.\n\n            See  Anderson v.

The discovery phase\n\nwas not merely \"sufficiently advanced.\"  It was complete.  And  a\n\ntrial on the liability issues had been completed.  The appellants\n\nreceived notice and  an opportunity  to be heard.   The  district\n\njudge,  before   entering  judgment,   allowed  the   parties  an\n\nopportunity to file written  submissions on the issues  that were\n\nraised at the conference.\n\n          In  their post-trial  memorandum,  the appellants  made\n\nsubstantially the same  argument as they  make before this  court\n\n(discussed below), and in both instances without any proffer that\n\nthey would be able to offer at a damages-phase trial any evidence\n\nthat would raise a genuine dispute of fact that might be resolved\n\nby a factfinder in their favor.\n\n          B.   The Alleged Need for a Jury Trial\r                                                          \n\n          The  appellants argue that a jury  trial on damages was\n\nnecessary  to determine  how much  of each  fraudulent  claim was\n\n                               -49-\r\r\n\nlegitimate,  that reported  losses were  merely exaggerated,  and\n\nthat Aetna's damages should be  limited to the difference between\n\nthe payment made by Aetna  and the actual loss to the  appellant.\n\nEach  of these arguments fails because, as a matter of law, Aetna\n\nis entitled to damages equal to the entire amount of its payments\n\non  fraudulent claims,  regardless of  any portion of  the claims\n\nthat might have  been shown  to be supportable  if no  fraudulent\n\nenlargement of the claims had occurred.\n\n          We put aside Aetna's  argument that appellants violated\n\nthe cooperation clause of the various policies under which claims\n\nwere made.  In part that clause provides:\n\n               After  an  accident  or loss,  you  or\n            anyone  else  covered  under this  policy\n            must   cooperate   with    us   in    the\n            investigation, settlement  and defense of\r                                                               \n            any claim or lawsuit. . . .\r                                          \n\n(App. 4800)(emphasis added).  Earlier automobile insurance policy\n\nforms,  from which this language  in the Aetna  policies at issue\n\ndescended, contained an Assistance  and Cooperation Clause, as it\n\nwas then called.  That clause initially appeared among conditions\n\nthat  applied only to liability  coverages.  The  claims at issue\n\nhere  were  made  under  collision coverage.    No  Massachusetts\n\nprecedent has  explicitly determined  that this clause  in policy\n\nforms like those at issue here applies to collision coverage.  In\n\nthese  circumstances, any  prediction about  whether the  Supreme\n\nJudicial Court  will hold that  this clause applies  to collision\n\ncoverage is speculative, but  we need not make any  prediction on\n\nthis matter  in  order  to  decide  this  case.    We  assume  in\n\n                               -50-\r\r\n\nappellants' favor, without deciding,  that the cooperation clause\n\nin  these Aetna policies does not apply to claims under collision\n\ncoverage.\n\n          The \"cooperation  clause,\" of  course, is not  the only\n\nprovision concerning  the obligations of  insureds and  claimants\n\nafter  an accident  or  loss.   Other  provisions concern  giving\n\nnotice and filing a proof of loss.\n\n          Appellants  contend  that  one or  another  of  various\n\npreclusion doctrines  of insurance law bars  Aetna from asserting\n\nthat making  a fraudulent  claim is  a violation  of  any of  the\n\nprovisions of the  policy under  which the  claim is  made.   One\n\nreason  all of the appellants' preclusion  arguments fail is that\n\non  the facts of this case, as determined by supportable findings\n\nof  the  jury,  every  claim   included  in  the  trial   court's\n\ncalculation  of  the  damages  award  has  been  found  to  be  a\n\nfraudulent claim.  In addition, every claim for which the Arsenal\n\ndefendants  were held liable was made  within the scope of a RICO\n\nsubstantive violation and a RICO  conspiracy, and every claim for\n\nwhich  appellant  Arhaggelidis was  held  liable  was within  the\n\nfinding against her on the ground of civil conspiracy.\n\n          A  claimant,   in  making   a  fraudulent  claim,   was\n\ncommitting a material breach -- indeed, a most fundamental breach\n\n-- of the  contract between Aetna and its  policyholder.  This is\n\ntrue, of course, not only of a claim by the policyholder but also\n\nof any claim under the policy by any other person entitled by the\n\nterms of the policy to make a claim under the policy.\n\n                               -51-\r\r\n\n          A  breach  as  fundamental as  this  is  a  bar to  the\n\nassertion of any further  rights under the contract by  the party\n\nguilty of the breach.  This is a basic rule of contract law.  See\r                                                                           \n\nE. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts 632-38 (2nd ed. 1990).  It applies\r                                        \n\nto insurance contracts as well as other contracts.\n\n          Appellants contend  that  one  or  another  of  various\n\npreclusion  doctrines  developed distinctively  in  insurance law\n\nnevertheless bars Aetna from asserting fraud by the appellants in\n\nthis  case.  This contention  fails because the  jury findings in\n\nthis case have  negated at least one of the essential elements of\n\neach preclusion theory appellants attempt to invoke.\n\n          The jury's findings negate the voluntary relinquishment\n\nof known rights that  is characteristic of waiver in  the classic\n\nsense,   the  detrimental   reliance  by   a  claimant   that  is\n\ncharacteristic of  estoppel in  the classic sense,  the voluntary\n\nchoice of an  option that  is characteristic of  election in  the\n\nclassic  sense, and insurer  overreaching of a  less informed and\n\nunequal  bargainer  that  is  characteristic of  cases  in  which\n\nprecedents  have stretched  doctrines  of waiver,  estoppel,  and\n\nelection beyond  their classic  meaning to favor  a disadvantaged\n\ninsured.\n\n            See generally id.  at 92-102, 319-23,  586-\r                                       \n          92;\n            John S.

Rev. 724 (1916).\n\n          Appellants   have   not   cited   any   precedent,   in\n\n                               -52-\r\r\n\nMassachusetts law or elsewhere,  that supports application to any\n\npart  of the verdict and judgment in  this case of any preclusion\n\ndoctrine  establishing  rights in  favor  of  insurance claimants\n\nbeyond  those provided by the terms of the contract of insurance.\n\nThese terms  include the limitations,  conditions, and exceptions\n\nas  well  as  its clauses  granting  and  defining  the scope  of\n\ncoverage.    Indeed,  in  view of  the  jury  finding  of a  RICO\n\nsubstantive violation  with Aetna  as victim, if  there were  any\n\nneed or occasion  to invoke principles of  preclusion rather than\n\nordinary contract doctrine to decide this case, the record  would\n\nbe  more congenial  to preclusion  against a  fraudulent claimant\n\nthan to preclusion of any of Aetna's defenses.\n\n          Although  the parties  have not  cited and  we  are not\n\naware  of any  Massachusetts precedent  directly  determining the\n\neffect of  fraudulent claims and RICO violations upon the measure\n\nof  recovery  to which  the  insurer  is entitled,  Massachusetts\n\ndecisions  on analogous  issues support  the judgment  entered in\n\nthis  case.   For example,  Massachusetts courts  have held  in a\n\nnumber of different contexts that an insured who committed  fraud\n\neither in  obtaining a policy or in  making a claim was precluded\n\nfrom recovering on a claim under the policy.\n\n            See  Airway  Underwriters  v.

These\n\namounts  were the only facts, in addition to the facts determined\n\nby  the jury  in the liability  phase, that were  material to the\n\ncourt's judgment.  Although  there may have been some  dispute as\n\nto  the  existence  and  extent  of  any  actual  losses  by  the\n\ndefendants, any dispute about these facts was not material to the\n\njudgment because the appellants' fraud (by either exaggerating or\n\ncompletely fabricating  losses) precluded them from asserting any\n\nright to recover for actual losses under the insurance contracts.\n\nSince no  triable fact disputes remained, the appellants were not\n\ndenied their right to  a jury trial.  The  court's determinations\n\nof the sums  certain to  be awarded against  the defendants  were\n\nproperly made as matters of law  -- that is, by the judge without\n\nsubmission to a jury.\n\n                      VIII.

Under  the  terms of  the\n\njudgment,  each  individual  Arsenal  defendant  is  jointly  and\n\nseverally liable for the entire amount of $1,500,000.\n\n          The  sole challenge in this appeal to this award or the\n\namount  of it  is  that the  Arsenal  appellants argue  that  the\n\ndistrict  court  improperly held  them  liable for  not  only the\n\nattorneys' fees  expended in  this case but  also the  attorneys'\n\nfees  expended in  a  related case  entitled  Aetna Casualty  and\r                                                                           \n\nSurety Co. v.

In the  Sport case, Aetna alleged that Sport  Auto Body,\r                                \n\nInc. and  its operators  were a part  of the  same conspiracy  to\n\ndefraud Aetna, which included Arsenal Auto and the other autobody\n\nshops.  The Sport case was consolidated with this case on May 17,\r                           \n\n1992.  Subsequently, the Sport defendants defaulted and the Clerk\r                                        \n\nentered judgment against them.\n\n          The   appellants  argument  fails   because  18  U.S.C.\n\n 1964(c) authorizes the recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees by\n\na prevailing plaintiff in a civil RICO case.  18 U.S.C.  1964(c).\n\nSince  the  Sport case  was  consolidated  with this  action  and\r                           \n\njudgment  was  entered  against  the  Sport  defendants  and  the\r                                                     \n\nindividual Arsenal  defendants for the same  RICO violations, the\n\ndistrict court correctly held  the Arsenal defendants jointly and\n\nseverally liable for reasonable attorneys' fees expended by Aetna\n\nfor   the   entire  suit.      Arsenal   appellants  argue,   but\n\nunconvincingly, that the district court's order of  consolidation\n\n                               -55-\r\r\n\ndid not extend to the phased trial.  The district court  rejected\n\nthe argument, and we find no abuse of discretion in this ruling.\n\n                    IX.  PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\r                              IX.  PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\n\n          Raising  this issue for the first time in a reply brief\n\non appeal, appellant Jack  Markarian challenges the inclusion, in\n\nthe judgment against  him, of prejudgment interest  on the treble\n\ndamages awarded under the  RICO claims.  He argues that since the\n\ntreble  damages  are punitive  in  nature  and not  compensatory,\n\nprejudgment interest is inappropriate.\n\n          The appellant failed to raise the issue either at trial\n\nor even  in his opening  brief, which was submitted  on behalf of\n\nall  the  Arsenal  defendants.

SEVERANCE\n\n          The Arsenal defendants  challenge the district  court's\n\ndenial  of  their  motion for  a  mistrial at  the  close  of the\n\nplaintiff's evidence.  They argue that the district  court should\n\nnot  have tried the case  against all fourteen  defendants in the\n\nsame  proceeding because of the potential for jury confusion.  In\n\naddition, the Arsenal defendants  argue that they were prejudiced\n\nby the jury's hearing evidence concerning the other defendants.\n\n          A mistrial need  not be allowed absent a  clear showing\n\nof prejudice.   United States v. Schlamo, 578 F.2d  888, 891 (1st\r                                                  \n\nCir.  1978).   We  review  the  mistrial  ruling  for  \"abuse  of\n\ndiscretion.\"   United States v.  Dockray, 943 F.2d  152, 157 (1st\r                                                  \n\nCir. 1991).\n\n          The defendants'  challenge to the trial court's failure\n\nto sever fails in this instance for several reasons.\n\n          First.    The  Arsenal  defendants never  moved  for  a\r                         \n\nseparate  trial of  the claims  against them.   Before  the trial\n\nbegan, they were  fully aware that all the defendants  were to be\n\ntried together and were informed of the identity of every witness\n\nto  be called and every exhibit to  be offered.  Absent a showing\n\nof materially  changed circumstances  after the trial  began, the\n\nArsenal defendants'  failure to  move for severance  before trial\n\nbegan precludes both their motion at the close of the plaintiffs'\n\n                               -59-\r\r\n\nevidence and  their challenge before this court.   Absent special\n\ncircumstances,  a party  is required  to object  to an  allegedly\n\nerroneous  or  prejudicial  procedure  while  the  court  has  an\n\nopportunity to correct it.\n\n            Cf. Computer Systems  Engineering, Inc.  v.\r                                                             \n          Qantel  Corp.,  740  F.2d 59,  69  (1st  Cir.\r                                 \n          1984)(\"A party may  not wait and  see whether\n          the  verdict is favorable  before deciding to\n          object.\");\n            see  also Harris v.  Chanclor, 537 F.2d 203\r                                                   \n          (5th Cir. 1976)(a motion for new trial on the\n          grounds that the  defendant should have  been\n          given a separate trial was properly denied in\n          light of the  defendant's failure to  press a\n          pre-trial motion to sever).\n\n          Second.  The defendants have not made the clear showing\r                          \n\nrequired  to support  a determination  that the  district court's\n\ndenial of a mistrial  was an abuse of  discretion.  No  appellant\n\nhas shown any prejudice from having all the claims at issue tried\n\ntogether.   No basis  appears in  the  record for  this court  to\n\nconclude  that  the jury  was unable  to differentiate  among the\n\ndefendants  and  to distinguish  the  evidence  relating to  each\n\ndefendant.   Moreover,  the district  court's  jury  instructions\n\ncautioned the jury to consider the claims against each  defendant\n\nseparately,  thus giving  added protection against  any potential\n\nprejudice.\n\n            See United States v.  Chamorro, 687 F.2d 1,\r                                                    \n          6  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, 459  U.S. 1043\r                                                 \n          (1982)(cautionary jury instructions dispelled\n          any significant risk of unfair prejudice).\n\nIn  fact, the  jury  found some  defendants  liable on  specified\n\ntheories and found other defendants not liable on those theories,\n\nthus  reinforcing  the inference  that  the  jury understood  its\n\n                               -60-\r\r\n\nresponsibility and was not confused by the size and complexity of\n\nthe case.\n\n            Cf.

Brandon,  17 F.3d 409, 440\r                                              \n          (1st  Cir.),  cert.   denied,  115  S.Ct.  80\r                                                \n          (1994).\n\n          Again,   the  jury's  verdict   shows  that   the  jury\n\nconsidered the evidence against each defendant separately.\n\n          Also, we  reject the  appellants'  suggestion that  the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of  Count VII (asserting a substantive\n\nRICO violation allegedly involving an overall association-in-fact\n\nenterprise) was an indication of the appropriateness and need for\n\na separate  trial.   The district  court  denied the  defendants'\n\nmotion  for judgment  as a matter  of law  on Count  IX (the RICO\n\nconspiracy) and  Count VIII (the RICO  substantive violation with\n\n                               -61-\r\r\n\nAetna  as  the enterprise),  and  the jury  ultimately  found the\n\ndefendants  liable  on  these  theories.   Severing  the  Arsenal\n\ndefendants would  have  required  Aetna  to present  all  of  the\n\nevidence twice in order to prove the scope of the same fraudulent\n\nscheme in each of two separate  trials.  The court's dismissal of\n\nCount VII  in no way, either explicitly or implicitly, determined\n\nthat a separate trial was  needed for any of the  multiple counts\n\nremaining after the dismissal.\n\n          Appellant Arhaggelidis is another  party who asserts on\n\nappeal  that  the district  court failed  to  provide her  with a\n\nseparate  trial.  She, too, is precluded from arguing this ground\n\nbefore this court  because she did not move  for a separate trial\n\nuntil after the  trial had  been completed.   Having never  moved\n\nbefore the verdict  for a  separate trial for  herself alone,  or\n\neven  for the Rodco/P&amp;B Autobody defendants as a group, she is in\n\nno position  to complain now that  she should have been  the sole\n\ndefendant  in a  separate  trial.   Taking  her argument  to  its\n\nlogical  conclusion,  that  each  defendant  should  have  had  a\n\nseparate trial, would  require that Aetna  present and the  court\n\nhear the  same evidence  up  to fourteen  times --  one for  each\n\ndefendant who chose to go to trial.  No more need be said.\n\n                    XI.   PRETRIAL ATTACHMENTS\r                              XI.   PRETRIAL ATTACHMENTS\n\n          The   Arsenal  defendants   argue  that   the  pretrial\n\nattachments obtained by Aetna in  the district court violated due\n\nprocess.    Their  challenge  of  the  pretrial  attachments  was\n\nrejected  six times at the  district court level.   The challenge\n\n                               -62-\r\r\n\nfails again, for several reasons.\n\n          First.    The  appellants' reliance  upon  the  Supreme\r                          \n\nCourt's  decision in  Connecticut  v. Doehr,  501 U.S.  1 (1991),\r                                                     \n\nholding that  the  Connecticut attachment  statute  violated  due\n\nprocess,  is not well-founded.   The procedure used  in this case\n\nwas  based on  the Massachusetts  Rules of Civil  Procedure; that\n\nprocedure  and  its  implementation   by  the  magistrate   judge\n\ncomported  with  due process  and  was  entirely consistent  with\n\nDoehr.\r               \n\n            See  Digital  Equipment  Corp.   v.  Currie\r                                                                 \n          Enterprises,  142  F.R.D.  16, 26  (D.

Although the assets were first attached by an\r                           \n\nex  parte  proceeding, the  magistrate  judge  later conducted  a\n\nlengthy  hearing at which the appellants were afforded \"more than\n\nadequate due process.\"  (Magistrate's  Order Re: Second Motion to\n\nDissolve  Ex Parte  Attachments, App. 852)   As a  result of this\n\nhearing,  the  magistrate  judge  determined  that  the  pretrial\n\nattachments   should  not  be  dissolved.     Id.    Judge  Young\r                                                           \n\nsubsequently denied the appellants  motion for reconsideration of\n\n                               -63-\r\r\n\nthe magistrate judge's decision,  implicitly determining that any\n\npossible defect in the ex parte procedure was irrelevant in \"view\n\nof  the   extensive  hearing  held  by   the  magistrate  judge.\"\n\n(Endorsed Order, App. 903.)\n\n          Third.   The conclusion that appellants'  have no basis\r                          \n\nfor relief from the  attachments at this time is  reinforced upon\n\nthe  rejection of other contentions  on this appeal  and upon the\n\naffirmance of  the final  judgment against the  defendants in  an\n\namount greatly in excess of the value of the attached assets.  In\n\nlight of their joint and several liability for $2,369,901.72,  no\n\nbasis remains, if ever there   was one, for an argument  that the\n\nattachment of  their assets should  now be vacated.   Determining\n\nwhat  process  is  due  in  pre-judgment  attachment  proceedings\n\nrequires a consideration of the risk of  an erroneous deprivation\r                                                               \n\nof  property.  See Doehr, 501 U.S. at 12.  With the affirmance of\r                                  \n\nthe judgment against all attacks on other grounds, no longer will\n\nthere  be  any such  risk.   Aetna  has prevailed  and subsequent\n\nevents  have  demonstrated  that  no  unwarranted deprivation  of\n\nproperty occurred.\n\n               XII.   ALLEGED PLEADING DEFICIENCIES\r                         XII.   ALLEGED PLEADING DEFICIENCIES\n\n          The  appellants challenge  the verdict  entered against\n\nthem on Count VI, which alleged a substantive RICO violation with\n\nArsenal  Auto Repairs, Inc. as  the enterprise.   They argue that\n\nthe  district  court erred  by not  granting their  Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion to dismiss Count  VI of the amended complaint  for failure\n\n                               -64-\r\r\n\nto state a cause of action.\n\n          The appellants' argument is  based on what Aetna claims\n\nis a  typographical  error.    Appellants argue  that  they  were\n\nconfused by paragraph 460 of the amended complaint, which alleges\n\nthat \"[e]ach  of the individual  policyholder/claimants named  in\n\nparagraph 38\"  participated in the conduct  of Arsenal's affairs.\n\nParagraph 38 names  Vachig Petrosyans,  but none  of the  Arsenal\n\nappellants.  Appellants  imply that they were prejudiced  by this\n\nerror because they had to \"guess\" at the meaning of Count VI.\n\n          The  appellants'  argument,   which  the  trial   court\n\nrejected four times, fails  again.  Paragraph 459 of  the amended\n\ncomplaint clearly  alleges that Tareh  Tirinkian, Lena Tirinkian,\n\nPeter Markarian, and  Jack Markarian conducted  Arsenal's affairs\n\nthrough a pattern of racketeering activity.  The appellant cannot\n\ndeny that Count VI was directed towards these four defendants.\n\n          Although  Count  VI  does   not  expressly  name  Tarja\n\nMarkarian, the fifth individual Arsenal  defendant, paragraph 460\n\ndoes refer to \"individual policyholders/ claimants\" and paragraph\n\n42 states that Tarja Markarian was a policyholder associated with\n\nArsenal Auto.   Therefore,  appellants' assertion that  they were\n\nconfused  is  both  unreasonable  and  unpersuasive.    Moreover,\n\nAetna's  Pretrial  Statement of  Claims  and  Damages, which  was\n\nsubmitted four  months  before trial,  states  that Count  VI  is\n\ndirected against the five individual Arsenal defendants and lists\n\nthem by name.   In these circumstances, the appellants  never had\n\nany basis for asserting that they were prejudiced at trial by any\n\n                               -65-\r\r\n\nconfusion purportedly caused by the amended complaint.\n\n              XIII.  COURT'S ANSWER TO JURY QUESTION\r                        XIII.  COURT'S ANSWER TO JURY QUESTION\n\n          The  Arsenal appellants challenge  the judgment against\n\nthem on Count  VIII, the RICO substantive  violation with Arsenal\n\nas the enterprise, on the ground that the judge, in response to a\n\nquestion by  the jury during their  deliberations, instructed the\n\njury  that the  Arsenal  defendants  were  not  part  of  such  a\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          Only  one sentence  of the appellants'  brief addresses\n\nthis  issue.  The appellant provides no argument or authority for\n\nits \n\nproposition.    This court  has previously held  that an argument\n\nthat is presented in  \"such a cursory and mechanical  fashion\" is\n\nrendered unpreserved on appeal.\n\n            Gamma Audio  &amp; Video, Inc.  v. Ean-Chea, 11\r                                                             \n          F.3d  1106,  1112 (1st.  Cir.  1994)(\"We have\n          consistently  admonished litigants  that they\n          cannot  simply  present  this  court  with  a\n          shopping list of arguments and then expect up\n          to both develop and address each one.\");\n            Ryan v.  Royal Ins. Co., 916  F.2d 731, 734\r                                             \n          (1st  Cir.  1990)(\"[I]ssues  adverted  to  on\n          appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied\n          by some developed  argumentation, are  deemed\n          to have been abandoned.\").\n\nSimilarly, the appellants have  not properly preserved this issue\n\nbefore this court.\n\n          Although the appellants are not entitled to a ruling on\n\nthis matter,  we note in any  event that no basis  for any relief\n\nappears in the record.  In  response to a written question by the\n\njury, the court  instructed the  jury again on  the various  RICO\n\n                               -66-\r\r\n\ntheories alleged by Aetna  and used a diagram to  illustrate some\n\naspects of his instruction.  Although it is not clear what aspect\n\nof  the response by the  court the appellants'  are attempting to\n\nput  in issue,  our examination  of the  record reveals  that the\n\nappellants'  have mischaracterized or  grossly misinterpreted the\n\ncourt's response to the jury's question.\n\n          From  the  record, it  appears  that the  court  drew a\n\ndiagram representing  the different enterprise theories  that had\n\nbeen submitted  to the jury.  Although  the record before us does\n\nnot  include this  diagram, the record  does include  the court's\n\noral instructions.\n\n          One of the theories  submitted to the jury, but  not at\n\nissue in this  appeal, was that  two or more  of the body  shops,\n\nother than  Arsenal Auto Repairs, Inc.,  constituted the \"Allston\n\ngroup\" enterprise.   The Arsenal defendants were never alleged to\n\nbe part of the \"Allston group.\"  Therefore, the court pointed out\n\nthat the defendants associated with the body shops that allegedly\n\nconstituted  the  \"Allston group\"  did  not  include the  Arsenal\n\ndefendants.    The court's  description  of  the \"Allston  group\"\n\ntheory had no bearing on the Arsenal defendants.  Nothing  in the\n\ncourt's detailed  response to the jury's  question indicated that\n\nthe  Arsenal defendants were not  alleged to have participated in\n\nthe  affairs of the Aetna enterprise.  In these circumstances, we\n\ndiscern no basis to  conclude that the trial court's  response to\n\nthe  jury's question  was inconsistent  with the  court's earlier\n\ninstructions  to the jury, or with the court's earlier rulings on\n\n                               -67-\r\r\n\nthe  theories to be  submitted to the  jury, or with  the verdict\n\nultimately rendered.   Thus, the appellants could  not prevail on\n\nthis issue even if they had preserved it.\n\n                  XIV.  SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE\r                            XIV.  SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE\n\n          A.   The Arsenal Appellants\r                                               \n\n          Having addressed  in Parts III.C and  III.D, supra, the\r                                                                      \n\nArsenal  appellants'  arguments  with  respect  to  the  elements\n\nnecessary to prove liability  for each of the two  RICO offenses,\n\nwe  turn  here to  the evidence  against  each of  the individual\n\nArsenal  defendants.   In  addition to  the  explanation in  Part\n\nIII.D,  supra, of the evidence  of RICO conspiracy,  we note here\r                       \n\nthat there was sufficient evidence against each defendant for the\n\njury to find  that each defendant conspired to violate  RICO.  We\n\nalso  conclude  that the  evidence  of an  ongoing  succession of\n\nfraudulent  claims   was  sufficient  to   meet  the   continuity\n\nrequirement necessary  to establish  a  pattern of  racketeering.\n\nAlthough  the  jury found  that  sixteen Aetna  claims  that were\n\nconnected with  the Arsenal defendants were  fraudulent, only two\n\npredicate  acts   are  necessary  to  constitute   a  pattern  of\n\nracketeering.   Thus, we need  only to conclude,  with respect to\n\neach  Arsenal defendant,  that there  was sufficient  evidence to\n\nsupport  findings of the fraudulent nature of two claims in which\n\nthe defendant was involved.\n\n            1.  Zareh Tirinkian\r                                         \n\n          With respect to Mr. Tirinkian, there was ample evidence\n\nof mail fraud.   Mr. Tirinkian  was a key  figure of the  Arsenal\n\n                               -68-\r\r\n\nbranch of  the RICO  conspiracy.  As  owner and  operator of  the\n\nArsenal Body Shop, he was directly involved in all aspects of the\n\nfraudulent  scheme.   Automobiles  were  appraised  and allegedly\n\nrepaired at his shop.  On behalf of Arsenal Auto, Mr. Tirinkian's\n\nname appears on appraisal forms,  agreeing, on behalf of  Arsenal\n\nAuto,  to perform  repair  work.   As  either  an insured,  or  a\n\nclaimant, or a person  aiding an insured or claimant  under Aetna\n\npolicies, Mr.  Tirinkian submitted fifteen insurance  claims that\n\nthe jury found to be fraudulent.\n\n          In  1988, Mr.  Tirinkian  submitted a  claim to  Aetna,\n\nstating that his 1976 Rolls Royce was  hit from behind and forced\n\ninto a guardrail by an unknown vehicle.  Mr. Tirinkian claims  to\n\nhave  driven home after this alleged accident.  Dexter, the Aetna\n\nappraiser, determined that the  car needed  $6,780.92 in repairs.\n\nWhen  called for  a second  appraisal, Dexter determined  that in\n\nfact it needed $12,023.00 in repairs,  $8,090.17 for parts alone.\n\nAt  trial, Mr. Tirinkian conceded that the only part he purchased\n\nwas  an axle  for  $300.   From  this  evidence, the  jury  could\n\nreasonably find that Mr. Tirinkian submitted a fraudulent claim.\n\n          In  1989, Mr.  Tirinkian reported  that his  1976 Rolls\n\nRoyce struck the back of a  BFI garbage truck that sped off after\n\nthe collision.   Mr. Tirinkian received  payment of $20,000  from\n\nAetna for this claim.  The record contains, in addition to  other\n\nevidence  presented  at  trial  supporting  the  suggestion,  the\n\ntestimony of  an expert  witness in accident  reconstruction, who\n\nsaid that  BFI operated no  truck \"that matched  in any shape  or\n\n                               -69-\r\r\n\nform  the damage that [he] saw on  this Rolls Royce.\"  The expert\n\ntestified  also  that  the damage  must  have  been  caused by  a\n\nperson's striking the car,  or driving it into other  objects, at\n\nleast seven times,  at different  angles and speeds.   From  this\n\nevidence,  the  jury could  reasonably  find  that Mr.  Tirinkian\n\nsubmitted a fraudulent claim to Aetna.\n\n          Since the  jury reasonably could have  found that these\n\ntwo   related  acts  of  mail  fraud  constituted  a  pattern  of\n\nracketeering activity, Mr. Tirinkian's  liability on the theories\n\nof RICO conspiracy (Count IX) and RICO substantive violation with\n\nAetna as the enterprise (Count VIII) is established.\n\n            2.  Lena Tirinkian\r                                        \n\n          Ms. Tirinkian  was an officer of  Arsenal Auto Repairs,\n\nInc.  She testified that she performed bookkeeping and accounting\n\nfor Arsenal  Auto, dealt  with insurance companies,  and received\n\nchecks  from them.  From her proximity to the Arsenal operations,\n\ntaken together with other evidence, the jury could infer that she\n\nconspired  with  her husband  and  other  defendants.   Like  Mr.\n\nTirinkian, Ms. Tirinkian was involved in several claims that  the\n\njury found  to be fraudulent.  A  finding that she committed mail\n\nfraud with respect to  two or more related claims  would support,\n\nin  turn, the  finding that  Ms. Tirinkian  violated   1962(c) by\n\nknowingly participating in the affairs of Aetna through a pattern\n\nof racketeering  activity.  We summarize the evidence against Ms.\n\nTirinkian with respect to two claims.\n\n          The Tirinkians  allege that Ms.  Tirinkian's 1979 Rolls\n\n                               -70-\r\r\n\nRoyce  was damaged  twice during transport  by Forge  Motors Auto\n\nTransport -- while being shipped  to the Tirinkian's Florida home\n\nin the fall of 1988 and while being shipped back to Massachusetts\n\nin the spring of 1989.  The second  claim to Aetna alleged that a\n\n$3,306.95 headlight  switch  was damaged  in  transit.   Yet,  at\n\ntrial, the  owner of Watertown Foreign Car Center, Inc. testified\n\nthat he had noticed that the headlights were not working sometime\n\nin the fall of 1988 and suggested to Mr.  Tirinkian that he get a\n\nnew headlight switch.\n\n          It is  Aetna's practice to require the  insured to sign\n\ncompleted work  forms before obtaining  payment from Aetna.   Ms.\n\nTirinkian  signed the completed work forms  relating to these two\n\nclaims  on her  1979 Rolls  Royce.   The forms  stated  that \"all\n\ndamage to my auto was repaired in accordance with the appraisal.\"\n\nAt  trial Ms. Tirinkian testified  that she never  saw the damage\n\nallegedly sustained by this vehicle, nor did she ever see the car\n\nat  Arsenal Auto or  any other auto  repair shop.    She admitted\n\nthat  she endorsed and deposited  in her bank  account the checks\n\nshe received from Aetna  with respect to these claims.   Although\n\nthe completed work form  with respect to the second  claim stated\n\nthat the repairs were completed by Watertown Foreign  Car Center,\n\nInc.,  the  owner of  that shop  testified  that no  repairs were\n\ncompleted there.    From this  and other  evidence introduced  at\n\ntrial,  the  jury  reasonably   could  find  that  Ms.  Tirinkian\n\ndefrauded  Aetna  by submitting  these  two false  claims  on her\n\nautomobile.\n\n                               -71-\r\r\n\n          Evidence of these two acts of mail fraud, among others,\n\nsupported a jury finding of a pattern of racketeering activity by\n\nMs. Tirinkian from which  the jury could find that  Ms. Tirinkian\n\nviolated  1962(c)  and (d).   Thus,  the district court  properly\n\ndenied Ms. Tirinkian's motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\n            3.  Jack Markarian\r                                        \n\n          Jack  Markarian, brother  of  Lena  Tirinkian,  was  an\n\nofficer  and employee of Arsenal Auto Repairs, Inc.  He testified\n\nat  trial  that  he  performed  repairs  and  managed  the  other\n\nemployees performing  repairs, and that Mr.  Tirinkian did mostly\n\npaperwork.  Given evidence  that he was in charge of  repair work\n\nat Arsenal Auto  where many of the cars that  were the subject of\n\nfraudulent  claims were  appraised and purportedly  repaired, the\n\njury  could infer that he knew and participated in the fraudulent\n\nscheme and conspired with his brother-in-law and others.\n\n          In a reply  brief filed  on his behalf  by new  counsel\n\nrepresenting him alone, appellant  Jack Markarian argues that the\n\ndistrict court  improperly denied  the motion  for judgment  as a\n\nmatter of law with respect to him.  He distinguishes himself from\n\nthe  other defendants  in that he  was neither  an insured  nor a\n\nclaimant with respect  to any of the claims the  jury found to be\n\nfraudulent.  His  strongest argument is that the plaintiff failed\n\nto  establish that  he  committed or  agreed  to commit  the  two\n\npredicate  acts necessary  for a  jury to  find him  liable under\n\neither   1962(c)  or (d).   After  close scrutiny,  however, this\n\nargument fails along with all others made on his behalf.\n\n                               -72-\r\r\n\n          It was not  necessary for  the jury to  find that  Jack\n\nMarkarian  committed mail  fraud  as a  principal.   Under  RICO,\n\naiding or abetting the commission of mail fraud  also constitutes\n\na  \"predicate act,\" because aiding  and abetting mail  fraud is a\n\nviolation  of  1341, the  mail fraud statute  itself.  Therefore,\n\nall  we have to decide  is whether there  was evidence sufficient\n\nfor  the jury to conclude  that Jack Markarian  aided and abetted\n\nanother Arsenal defendant in  the commission of two acts  of mail\n\nfraud.\n\n          From  Jack  Markarian's formal  position  and extensive\n\ninvolvement in the everyday operations  of Arsenal Auto, the jury\n\nreasonably could infer that Jack Markarian aided and  abetted his\n\nfriends  and relatives  in  submitting fraudulent  claims.   This\n\ninference is  supported as well by  other circumstantial evidence\n\nintroduced at trial.\n\n          One example  is that  Jack Markarian testified  that he\n\nwas at  Arsenal Auto when the 1976 Rolls Royce was towed in after\n\nallegedly hitting the BFI truck  and that he \"went over\"  the car\n\nwith the Aetna appraiser who arrived  later.  Given the fact that\n\nMarkarian  placed himself at the scene with the 1976 Rolls Royce,\n\nthe jury could infer that he  helped to inflict damage on the car\n\nbefore  the arrival  of the  Aetna appraiser,  who this  time was\n\nneither  Dexter nor Cummings, or that at the least Jack Markarian\n\nknew about and helped to conceal from the appraiser what had been\n\ndone.\n\n          Another  example  concerns  a  check  written  by  Jack\n\n                               -73-\r\r\n\nMarkarian.  At  trial Jack Markarian was asked  about a check for\n\n$9,000 that he wrote to Mr. Keshishian, a person who was involved\n\nwith  two of the allegedly fraudulent  claims submitted to Aetna.\n\nMr. Markarian testified that this check was a loan.  Similarly, a\n\npayment previously made by  Keshishian's brother to Tirinkian for\n\n$13,000 had  been explained as a  loan, but was made  on the same\n\nday  that Mr.  Keshishian  received a  payment  from Aetna  on  a\n\nfraudulent claim  he had  submitted on an  automobile purportedly\n\nrepaired  at  Arsenal  Auto.     The  jury,  not  believing  this\n\nexplanation, could have inferred that the payment by Keshishian's\n\nbrother  to  Tirinkian  was  a kickback.    Similarly,  the  jury\n\nreasonably could choose to discredit Jack Markarian's explanation\n\nfor  his own  $9,000 payment  and infer  that Jack  Markarian was\n\nproviding a kickback to Mr. Keshishian in connection with another\n\nfraudulent claim.  Thus, the jury could infer that Jack Markarian\n\naided and abetted the commission of a fraud upon Aetna.\n\n          In   many   respects,   Jack    Markarian's   testimony\n\ncorroborated that  of his  brother-in-law, Zareh Tirinkian.   For\n\nexample, Jack Markarian testified  that he saw his brother-in-law\n\nworking on the 1976 Rolls Royce after the \"guardrail\" accident in\n\nJune 1988, and  even stated that he himself had  done some of the\n\nrepair  work.   Jack  Markarian  also testified  that  the reason\n\nArsenal did  not  make available  any  autobody shop  records  or\n\ndocuments  for discovery or at trial was that they were destroyed\n\nby  flooding in the  autobody shop.   The jury  could infer, from\n\nJack Markarian's willingness to corroborate  his brother-in-law's\n\n                               -74-\r\r\n\nstory,  which the jury appears  to have discredited,  that he was\n\nactively involved in the racketeering activities of Arsenal Auto.\n\n          As the head of repairs at Arsenal Auto,  Jack Markarian\n\nstood to benefit from Arsenal Auto's obtaining payment from Aetna\n\nfor  work that  was never  performed.   At trial,  Jack Markarian\n\ntestified that he  and his  employees repaired many  of the  cars\n\nthat the plaintiff  alleged, and offered  evidence to show,  were\n\nnever  damaged.  He also  testified to the  general procedure for\n\ndealing with insurance companies,  appraisers, and customers when\n\nan accident occurs.  The jury  could infer that, in his  position\n\nat Arsenal  Auto, Jack Markarian frequently  met with appraisers,\n\nincluding  Cummings  and  Dexter,  and  discussed  estimates  for\n\nrepairs.  The jury  could infer that Jack Markarian, in this way,\n\naided  and  abetted  his  friends  and  relatives  in  submitting\n\nfraudulent claims to Aetna.\n\n          Despite  appellant Jack  Markarian's assertions  to the\n\ncontrary, the record contains ample evidence for the jury to find\n\nthat he  aided and  abetted others  in filing  fraudulent claims,\n\nthereby  committing two  or  more predicate  acts constituting  a\n\npattern of racketeering activity.  Therefore, the jury reasonably\n\ncould find  that Jack Markarian  participated in  the affairs  of\n\nAetna, the  enterprise, in the substantive  violation of  1962(c)\n\nand  in the RICO conspiracy  in violation of   1962(d), through a\n\npattern of racketeering activity.\n\n            4.  Peter and Tarja Markarian\r                                                   \n\n                               -75-\r\r\n\n          Appellant Peter Markarian,  brother of Lena  Tirinkian,\n\nwas  an employee  of  Arsenal  Auto  during  the  course  of  the\n\nconspiracy  except for six months during 1988.  He testified that\n\nhe  had done automobile repair work since  he was a teenager.  He\n\nalso testified  that when  he was  at Arsenal  Auto he  would see\n\nDexter and Cummings, the Aetna appraisers, as frequently as twice\n\na week.\n\n          Appellant  Tarja   Markarian  is  the  wife   of  Peter\n\nMarkarian and  co-owner of their  1970 Mercedes.   Tarja admitted\n\nthat  she  sometimes  worked   at  Arsenal  Auto  Repairs,  Inc.,\n\nanswering phones and running errands.\n\n          The evidence  shows that  Peter Markarian and  his wife\n\nTarja Markarian submitted  six claims on  their Mercedes, two  of\n\nwhich were to Aetna, within  a span of three years, from  1986 to\n\n1988.  The jury found four of these claims to be fraudulent.\n\n          The  first  claim  the  Markarians  reported  to  Aetna\n\nalleged  that their  car  was damaged  while  parked at  a  movie\n\ntheater.   The description of the damage to the car was identical\n\nto that alleged in a previous claim to another insurance company.\n\nSix  months later,  the Markarians  submitted a  second claim  to\n\nAetna  alleging that  their  Mercedes had  been vandalized  while\n\nparked at  the Burlington  Mall.   Fifteen months earlier,  Peter\n\nMarkarian's  sister, Ms.  Garabedian,  had submitted  a claim  to\n\nAetna alleging that her Mercedes had been vandalized while parked\n\nat the Burlington Mall.\n\n          Peter  Markarian testified  that  he repaired  the  car\n\n                               -76-\r\r\n\nafter  both alleged  claims and that  he purchased  the necessary\n\nparts  with  cash.   He  was  unable  to provide  any  records or\n\nreceipts of such purchases.  Tarja Markarian signed the completed\n\nwork  forms for both sets of repairs.   Each form stated that the\n\nrepairs  were completed by Arsenal  Auto.  She  also endorsed and\n\ndeposited  the checks  from Aetna  to the Markarians  relating to\n\nthese  claims.  At trial,  Tarja Markarian admitted  that she had\n\nnever seen the damage on  the car and had never seen  any repairs\n\nbeing  made.  An Aetna investigator who examined the car pursuant\n\nto a court-ordered  inspection, testified at  trial that many  of\n\nthe alleged repairs  had never  been made  and that  some of  the\n\nalleged damage never occurred.\n\n          From the  evidence concerning these two  claims and the\n\nevidence  concerning the  Markarians'  claim  history,  the  jury\n\nreasonably could  infer that  the Markarians participated  in the\n\naffairs  of Aetna  through  a pattern  of racketeering  activity,\n\nconsisting of acts of mail fraud, in violation of  1962(c).  From\n\nPeter Markarian's employment at Arsenal Auto and his relationship\n\nwith  the Aetna  appraisers,  the  jury  could infer  that  Peter\n\nMarkarian  conspired with  the other  defendants in  violation of\n\n 1962(d).  Similarly, from Tarja Markarian' false representations\n\nwith respect to the Aetna claims and her work, albeit limited, at\n\nArsenal  Auto, the jury could  infer that she  conspired with her\n\nhusband and other Arsenal defendants and was a member of the RICO\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          B.   Betty Arhaggelidis\r                                           \n\n                               -77-\r\r\n\n          Much   of  the   evidence   against   appellant   Betty\n\nArhaggelidis has been  described in  Part III.E, supra.   We  add\r                                                                \n\nhere, some  additional details that further  demonstrate that the\n\nevidence supported the jury's findings.\n\n          In addition  to finding  that Mr. and  Ms. Arhaggelidis\n\nacted  in concert,  the  jury  reasonably  could  find  that  Ms.\n\nArhaggelidis actively  committed common  law fraud by  submitting\n\nfalse claims  to Aetna.  To  establish fraud (the tort  of common\n\nlaw  deceit), the plaintiff must  show that the  defendant made a\n\nfalse statement of material fact with knowledge of its falsity in\n\norder  to  induce  the  plaintiff  to  act,  and  that  plaintiff\n\njustifiably  relied on  the  false statement  to the  plaintiff's\n\ndetriment.   Danca v. Taunton Savings Bank, 429 N.E.2d 1129, 1133\r                                                    \n\n(Mass. 1982).\n\n          Betty  Arhaggelidis used  two cars  to obtain  payments\n\nfrom Aetna.  The title to one of the cars, a Mercedes 380 SL, was\n\nin  the  name  of her  mother,  Ms.  Paikopoulos.   The  evidence\n\nsupported  a finding,  however, that  Betty Arhaggelidis  was the\n\nregular driver of the car, her  mother had never purchased a car,\n\nand her mother did not have a driver's license.  When claims were\n\nmade  to Aetna on this Mercedes 380 SL, Ms. Arhaggelidis received\n\nthe  checks  from Aetna  at her  own address,  which was  not Ms.\n\nPaikopoulos's address.  From this evidence, the  jury could infer\n\nthat Ms. Arhaggelidis arranged for title  to the car to be in her\n\nmother's name in order to conceal fraudulent activity.\n\n          One  of the  claims submitted  on  the Mercedes  380 SL\n\n                               -78-\r\r\n\nalleged  that Amir  Lajervardi hit the  parked car.   Thirty-four\n\ndays  later, the car reportedly  hit another parked  car owned by\n\nMohammad Mohammadi.   Thirty-three days after  that, the Mercedes\n\n240D, title to which  was in the name of  Betty Arhaggelidis, was\n\nallegedly  rear-ended by  Rahim  Nima.      At  trial,  Mr.  Nima\n\ntestified that  Mr. Mohammadi was his roommate and Mr. Lajervardi\n\nwas  his  classmate.    Three  months later,  the  Mercedes  240D\n\nsupposedly  rear-ended a  Mercedes owned  by Mr.  Diamondopoulos.\n\nMr.  Diamondopoulos testified  at trial  that the  accident never\n\nhappened.   With  respect  to this  accident, Betty  Arhaggelidis\n\nsigned a \"Total Loss  Affidavit\" and submitted it to Aetna.   She\n\nthen received,  endorsed, and deposited Aetna's  payment into her\n\naccount.\n\n          From this  and other evidence introduced  at trial, the\n\njury  could reasonably  infer  that Ms.    Arhaggelidis acted  in\n\nconcert with her husband to commit fraud and personally committed\n\nacts of  fraud.   Therefore, Ms. Arhaggelidis  was properly  held\n\njointly and severally  liable for all the  claims associated with\n\nRodco/P&amp;B Autobody.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\n\n          In  summary, we  conclude  that none  of the  arguments\n\nadvanced  on  appeal  supports  reversal of  any  aspect  of  the\n\njudgment in this case.  The district court commendably  fashioned\n\nan order for phasing of trial in two consolidated cases, with all\n\ndisputed and  material issues bearing  on liability  to be  tried\n\nbefore  a jury in the  first phase.   In post-verdict proceedings\n\n                               -79-\r\r\n\nanalogous  to a  hearing on  a motion  for summary  judgment, the\n\ndistrict court  correctly determined  that no genuine  dispute of\n\nfact  remained for  jury  determination and  that final  judgment\n\nshould be  entered for  Aetna on  the jury verdict,  establishing\n\nliability, and on the court's  calculation of damages based  upon\n\nfacts disclosed on the record and not subject to genuine dispute.\n\nThe district court's  pretrial order  for phasing  and its  post-\n\nverdict   proceedings  were  well-tailored   to  the  distinctive\n\ncharacteristics of this legally and factually complex litigation.\n\nTogether they  achieved fair and appropriate  adjudication of all\n\nclaims and defenses on  the merits.  Proceeding in  this fashion,\n\nthe court also effected substantial reductions of delay  and cost\n\nfor  the  parties and  the  court system,  an  objective strongly\n\ncommended by Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\r                                                                  \n\n                               -80-\r\r\n",

He  is  the  husband  of\n\nappellant  Betty Arhaggelidis.  She was the owner of two Mercedes\n\nupon which six fraudulent claims were made to Aetna.\n\n          Another  of  the  body  shops, Arsenal  Auto  (also  an\n\nappellant in  this action), was  owned and operated  by appellant\n\nZareh Tirinkian.  His wife, Lena Tirinkian, and her brothers John\n\nMarkarian  and Peter  Markarian  were employees  of Arsenal  Auto\n\nduring the period of the alleged fraudulent scheme.\n\n          Tarja Markarian  and her husband  Peter Markarian  were\n\nthe co-owners of a Mercedes upon which two fraudulent claims were\n\nmade to Aetna.\n\n          From  1987 to  1989, the  Arsenal defendants,  together\n                    \r                              \n\n1   The  published  version of  this  Opinion includes  only  the\nbackground statement  of facts (Part  I) and discussion  of those\nissues  that  may  be  of   general  interest  (Parts  II-IX  and\nConclusion).

Aetna\n\npaid  $137,346.83 on these claims.   The Arsenal defendants filed\n\nat least  ten additional  fraudulent claims with  other insurance\n\ncompanies on the same group of  cars.  The Tirinkians submitted a\n\ntotal of  fifteen fraudulent claims  (seven to Aetna)  upon which\n\neither Lena or Tareh  Tirinkian was the claimant or  the insured.\n\nPeter and  Tarja Markarian submitted four  fraudulent claims (two\n\nto Aetna) on their Mercedes.  John Markarian, who filed no claims\n\nin his own name, was the  supervisor of repairs at Arsenal  Auto,\n\nwhere most of  the cars  involved in the  fraudulent claims  were\n\nstored and purportedly repaired.\n\n          Timothy Cummings and Steven Dexter were two of the many\n\nAetna  appraisers who covered the area where Arsenal Auto and the\n\nother body shops were located.  Either Cummings or Dexter did the\n\nappraisal  for  ten of  the  sixteen fraudulent  claims  that the\n\nArsenal  defendants  (personally  or  in cooperation  with  their\n\nfriends)  filed  over a  three-year  period  commencing in  1987.\n\nCummings  and  Dexter  submitted  false appraisals  to  help  the\n\nArsenal defendants defraud Aetna.\n\n          In the district court,  judgment was entered by default\n\nagainst Cummings and Dexter under RICO for $789,967.24 (being the\n\namount paid out  by Aetna  on 112 insurance  claims submitted  to\n\nAetna  that  the  jury   found  to  be  fraudulent)  trebled   to\n\n$2,359,901.72 plus interest at 12% per annum from October 2, 1989\n\non the  trebled amount, plus $1,500,000  in costs, disbursements,\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nand attorneys' fees.\n\n          For  each of  the  sixteen  fraudulent claims  directly\n\ninvolving  the  Arsenal defendants  and friends  cooperating with\n\nthem, Aetna, in accordance  with its business practices, required\n\na completed work form to be submitted by the claimant.  At trial,\n\nthe  Arsenal defendants  did not  provide any  documentation that\n\nArsenal  Auto or  any other  autobody shop  completed any  of the\n\nrepairs in  connection with any of  the claims.  With  respect to\n\nsome claims, the evidence shows  that the claimed accidents never\n\noccurred; in  other cases,  the claimed damage  was intentionally\n\ninflicted.  The jury  may have supportably inferred that  in some\n\ncases defective parts were placed on the cars for the purpose  of\n\nappraisal and then later replaced with the original parts.\n\n          The  jury found  that  each of  the individual  Arsenal\n\ndefendants  was liable  for  a substantive  RICO violation  under\n\n 1962(c)  for  participating in  the affairs  of Aetna  through a\n\npattern of racketeering activity.  The jury also found all of the\n\nindividual  Arsenal defendants liable,  under  1962(d),  for RICO\n\nconspiracy  with the  adjusters and the  operators of  other body\n\nshops  (not including Betty Arhaggelidis).\n\n          The judgment against the  Arsenal defendants was in the\n\nsame amount, and on  the same calculus, as that  against Cummings\n\nand Dexter, explained above.\n\n          Appellant  Betty Arhaggelidis  was associated  with the\n\nfraudulent  scheme through  her husband,  the owner  of Rodco/P&amp;B\n\nAutobody, one  of  the  five  autobody  shops  involved.    Betty\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nArhaggelidis owned  two Mercedes, one of which  was registered in\n\nher  mother's  name.   These two  Mercedes  were involved  in six\n\nfraudulent claims, as to all of which Cummings did the appraisal.\n\n The  jury found that she  was liable under  a \"civil conspiracy\"\n\ntheory  centered around  Rodco/P&amp;B  Autobody, and  therefore  was\n\nliable in connection with thirty-seven fraudulent claims.\n\n          The  appellants challenge the judgments entered against\n\nthem  on  a variety  of grounds.    In addition,  each appellant,\n\nexcept  for  Arsenal Auto  Repairs,  Inc.,  appeals the  district\n\ncourt's  denial of his or her motion  for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw because of insufficiency of the evidence.\n\n          First  we   consider  the  issues   arising  from   the\n\nrelationships  among the  RICO  counts and  the civil  conspiracy\n\ncount, then we consider other issues raised by one or more of the\n\nappellants.\n\n     II.  RELATIONSHIPS AMONG COUNTS OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT\r               II.  RELATIONSHIPS AMONG COUNTS OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\n          Appellants,  at various points,  both in  oral argument\n\nand in briefs before this court,  have seemed to suggest that the\n\njudgment against them in  this case is somehow flawed  because of\n\nsome  aspect of  the relationships  among the  different theories\n\nalleged and tried before  the jury.  We address  specific aspects\n\nof this suggestion in Part III, infra.  We address the suggestion\r                                               \n\nmore broadly here.\n\n          The district court  considered five different  theories\n\n(asserted in  five different  counts) that are  relevant to  this\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ninquiry:  three claims of RICO substantive violations, one  claim\n\nof RICO conspiracy, and one non-RICO conspiracy claim.\n\n               First.  Count  VII, a RICO substantive\r                              \n            violation  under    1962(c)  alleging  an\n            association-in-fact  enterprise.     This\n            theory was dismissed from the case in the\n            trial court.\n\n               Second.      Count   VIII,    a   RICO\r                               \n            substantive   violation  under    1962(c)\n            alleging  Aetna as  the enterprise.   The\n            jury  found that  this  claim was  proved\n            against     all    individual     Arsenal\n            appellants.\n\n               Third.   Count VI,  a RICO substantive\r                              \n            violation   under    1962(c),    alleging\n            Arsenal Auto as the enterprise.  The jury\n            found that this claim was  proved against\n            all individual Arsenal appellants.\n\n               Fourth.   Count  IX, alleging  a  RICO\r                                \n            conspiracy  under   1962(d).    The  jury\n            found that this  claim was proved against\n            all individual Arsenal appellants.\n\n               Fifth.    Count  X, common  law  civil\r                              \n            conspiracy.   The  jury found  that  this\n            claim   was   proved   against  all   the\n            appellants,  including  Arsenal Auto  and\n            Arhaggelidis.\n\n          The judgment against  the individual Arsenal appellants\n\njointly and severally in the amount of $2,359,901.72 is supported\n\nby  the  jury's  finding of  liability  on  Counts  VIII and  IX.\n\nTherefore,  if we determine that either the finding on Count VIII\r                                                 \n\nor  that on  Count IX  is supported  by sufficient  evidence, the\n\njudgment must  stand.  In fact, as we explain below, we find that\n\nthe  evidence was  sufficient  for the  jury  reasonably to  find\n\nliability on both Count VIII (the RICO substantive violation with\r                           \n\nAetna as the enterprise) and Count IX (the RICO conspiracy).\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          The Arsenal appellants do not challenge the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence in  support of the jury's finding of liability on\n\nCount VI or  on Count X.  The only  argument raised by appellants\n\nwith respect  to  Count  VI is  an  argument  regarding  pleading\n\ndeficiency  that  we have  rejected  as  wholly without  support.\n\nMoreover, because  we have  determined that the  judgment against\n\nthe individual  Arsenal appellants is supported  by jury findings\n\non Count VIII and Count IX, we have no reason to consider whether\n\nappellants are independently  liable under Count VI,  Count X, or\n\nboth.\n\n          The  judgment against Arsenal  Auto Repairs, Inc. which\n\nis also an  appellant in this action, is  supported by the jury's\n\nfinding of  liability on  Count X,  the civil conspiracy  theory.\n\nArsenal Auto has not challenged  the sufficiency of the  evidence\n\nsupporting the jury's finding with respect to its liability under\n\nCount X.   The judgment against Arsenal Auto is  affirmed for the\n\nreasons stated in other parts of this Opinion.\n\n          The   judgment   against   appellant  Arhaggelidis   is\n\nsupported  by the  jury's finding  of liability  on Count  X, the\n\ncivil  conspiracy theory.    We conclude  that  the evidence  was\n\nsufficient to support the  jury's finding against Arhaggelidis on\n\nCount X.\n\n          From this summary, it is clear that  one of appellants'\n\nassertions  is  true:    the  relationships  among  transactions,\n\ndefendants,  and  legal  claims  are  complex  both  legally  and\n\nfactually.   A question remains,  however, as to  how, if at all,\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nany of those complexities or all of them taken together bear upon\n\nany of the issues before this court on appeal.\n\n          Nowhere in the trial record, or in their  briefs before\n\nthis court, except in  a passage from their brief  that is quoted\n\nin  Part III, infra, and  an argument that  the consolidated case\r                             \n\nwas too  complex for a  jury to understand, App.  Brief at 59-61,\n\ndid the appellants ever  clearly formulate an argument or  set of\n\narguments based upon their hints and innuendos about complexity.\n\n          Nevertheless, we have read  with special care all parts\n\nof the briefs containing such hints or suggestions.  We have done\n\nso,  first, to  be certain  we have  not overlooked  any argument\n\npresented  and, second, to assure that we have taken into account\n\nany cited cases that  might bear upon the  issues presented by  a\n\nfact pattern  as  complex as  that before  us, with  interlocking\n\npersonal, family, and institutional relationships.\n\n          Entirely apart  from the complexities added  by RICO, a\n\nrisk of confusion has long existed because of relationships among\n\ndifferent legal and factual theories  of conspiracy that might be\n\ninvoked by the parties or  by a court.  The law bearing  upon the\n\npotential   consequences  of   invoking  different   theories  of\n\nconspiracy is  more extensively developed in  criminal cases than\n\nin  civil.  Even with  respect to the  criminal context, however,\n\nrelevant statutes  and precedents  provide only  limited guidance\n\nfor structuring factual and legal analysis.\n\n          In criminal  cases, issues arise often  with respect to\n\nwhether a case should be viewed as one involving:\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          (1)  a  single  conspiracy of  many  parties,  multiple\n\nobjectives, and broad sweep;\n\n          (2) multiple independent conspiracies; or\n\n          (3)  a  nest  of  interlocking  conspiracies  that  may\n\ninvolve  overlapping  conspiracies  or  smaller,  discrete  inner\n\nconspiracies  of fewer persons and smaller scope that are tied in\n\nwith a larger conspiracy  whose members include some but  not all\n\nof the members of the discrete inner conspiracies.\n\n            See, e.g., United States v.

But  the choice,  in the  civil context\n\nalso, may  be burdened with  consequences -- a point  to which we\n\nreturn below.\n\n          In this  case, added  layers of complexity  incident to\n\nrelationships  among  theories exist,  not  only  because of  the\n\nrelationships  between different  conspiracy  counts --  Count IX\n\n(RICO  conspiracy) and  Count  X (civil  conspiracy) --  but also\n\nbecause of the  relationships among these  counts and the  counts\n\nalleging  RICO  substantive  violations (Counts  VII  and  VIII).\n\nAlso, as in criminal  cases, see, e.g., Oreto, No.  91-1769, slip\r                                                       \n\nop.  at 19, an answer as to  what significance, if any, the legal\n\nand factual theories may have, must be context sensitive.\n\n          Because procedural law allows  alternative contentions,\n\nparties to  a civil action involving such an array of factual and\n\nlegal  theories as  this case  presents may  be allowed  to defer\n\nchoice at least  until late  stages of proceedings  in the  trial\n\ncourt.   For example, both  plaintiffs and defendants  in a civil\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ncase may be allowed to maintain alternative contentions at  least\n\nuntil the evidence  is closed,  when the court  may require  some\n\nchoices  to be  made about  the  form of  verdict to  be used  in\n\nsubmitting the case to the jury -- see Fed.  R. Civ. P. 49 -- and\r                                                \n\nabout instructions  to the jury.   When a party does  not request\n\neither  a  \"special  question\"  or an  instruction  submitting  a\n\nparticular theory of conspiracy  to the jury, that party  makes a\n\nchoice that  has the  associated consequence of  almost certainly\n\nprecluding the assertion  after verdict of the  omitted theory of\n\nconspiracy.   See,  e.g.,  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. 49.    The  law  (a\r                           \n\nprocedural  rule, in  this instance)  allows choice,  but it  may\n\nlimit  the scope  of  choice by  defining  consequences that  are\n\nattached  to each of the  available options, rather than allowing\n\ncomplete  freedom of choice.   A  party making  a choice  of this\n\nkind, among legally defined options only, is making an \"election\"\n\nin the classic sense.  See John S. Ewart, Waiver  or Election, 29\r                                                                       \n\nHarv. L. Rev. 724 (1916).\n\n          Of  course, a  trial  court may  in some  circumstances\n\nallow  submission to  a  jury  of  two  or  more  theories,  with\n\nappropriate instructions explaining as to each theory the factual\n\nelements the jury must  find to return a verdict  sustaining that\n\ntheory.   The  different  theories submitted  to  a jury  may  be\n\nfactually  compatible  --  that  is,   a  verdict  sustaining all\n\ntheories  submitted  may  be  permissible.   Also,  however,  the\n\nevidence and the different theories of  conspiracy submitted to a\n\njury in a particular  case may be so factually  incompatible that\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nthe  jury's choice is  limited to finding  one or another  of the\n\ntheories supported, but not all.\n\n          In the present case, the trial judge, in submitting the\n\ncase to the jury, used a verdict form that at  first glance might\n\nappear  to  be  a  submission  on  \"special questions,\"  with  no\n\n\"general  verdict,\"   under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  49(a).    Closer\n\nexamination,  however, of both the verdict form and the record of\n\ncolloquies about  it, discloses  that the court  required only  a\n\ngeneral verdict of  the jury, under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 49(b), as to\n\neach claim  against each  defendant, after elimination  of claims\n\nthat were alleged but  as to which either the court  rejected the\n\nclaim  as a  matter  of law  (the association-in-fact  conspiracy\n\ntheory  alleged in  Count VII) or  Aetna elected  not  to request\n\nsubmission to the jury.\n\n          The  submission of  a separate  question requiring  the\n\njury to report  an answer as to  each of at least 122  of the 176\n\nallegedly  fraudulent  claims  was  necessary   because  disputed\n\nfactual issues were presented not only with respect to whether an\n\nalleged  RICO   conspiracy  and  the   alleged  RICO  substantive\n\nviolations existed, and, if so, what defendants were liable under\n\neach  theory,  but  also with  respect  to  whether  each of  the\n\ntransactions  was   within  the   scope  of  the   conspiracy  or\n\nsubstantive violation.  The  answers have a bearing on  the terms\n\nof  the judgment  to  be entered,  even  though the  trial  judge\n\ndetermined  (supportably,  we  have  concluded)  that no  genuine\n\ndispute of fact existed as to the amount paid by Aetna on each of\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nthe 112 claims the jury found to be fraudulent.\n\n          In summary, we conclude  that the verdicts and judgment\n\nfor  plaintiff  against  the  appellants  are  supported  by  the\n\nevidence received in this case, and by law.\n\n                    III.

With\n\nrespect to defendant Betty Arhaggelidis, the appellee argues that\n\nthe judgment in  the amount  of $373,857.28 is  supported by  the\n\njury finding that she was liable on a theory of civil conspiracy.\n\nWe examine the evidence supporting each of these theories against\n\neach defendant in Parts III.C, III.D, and III.E, infra.\r                                                                \n\n          B.

They contend that once the\n\ndistrict  court  granted defendants'  motion  for  judgment as  a\n\nmatter  of  law  on Count  VII  (the  RICO substantive  violation\n\nalleging   an   association-in-fact   enterprise  including   all\n\ndefendants),  the  district  court  should  have  granted,  also,\n\ndefendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law on Counts VIII\n\nand  IX.  (This  argument was not  made in the  trial court as to\n\ndefendants' motion for judgment as a  matter of law on Count  VI,\n\nnor is it asserted on appeal.  Count VI, alleging Arsenal Auto as\n\nthe enterprise, alleges  a scheme  of a smaller  scope than  that\n\nalleged in Count VII.   Thus, no plausible  argument can be  made\n\nthat the court's dismissal of Count VII requires the dismissal of\n\nCount VI.)\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          Appellants do  not clearly state the  legal premises of\n\ntheir  preclusion argument.   Reading  generously to  appellants,\n\nhowever, to assure that we address any contention that might even\n\nplausibly be presented,  we infer that some asserted principle of\n\npreclusion is  at least  implicitly if not  explicitly suggested.\n\nFor example, appellants say:\n\n               The trial judge's  ruling directing  a\n            verdict for  all Defendants on  Count VII\n            of  the  Complaint,  because   there  was\n            \"insufficient  evidence to  sustain Count\n            7,    an   overall    association-in-fact\n            enterprise,\"  (App. 4092),  separated the\n            Arsenal   Defendants   from   the   other\n            Defendants  in  the   case  and   thereby\n            disassociated  [sic]  the actions  of the\n            Allston   Group  from  the  acts  of  the\n            Arsenal   Defendants.       Without   the\n            association-in-fact  enterprise  to  meld\n            the acts of  the various Defendants  into\n            an overall conspiracy,  the link  between\n            the  Arsenal  Defendants and  the Allston\n            Group was severed  thereby absolving  the\n            Arsenal  Defendants  from any  wrongdoing\n            concerning  bribery.  As  such, the trial\n            judge's ruling,  by implication, absolved\n            the Arsenal Defendants  from bearing  the\n            burden of the Allston Group's bribery.\n\nAppellants' Brief at 41-42.\n\n          It  is true  that  each of  Counts  VII, VIII,  and  IX\n\nalleges a  fraudulent scheme  that includes  all the  body shops.\n\nThese three theories have the same \"scope\" in the sense that each\n\nof them would support the judgment against the Arsenal individual\n\ndefendants in  the amount  of $2,369,901.72.   Nevertheless, each\n\ncount  asserts a  distinctive  theory,  and  none  of  the  three\n\ntheories has  all  of the  elements of  any other  of the  three.\n\nCounts  VII and  VIII  allege RICO  substantive violations  under\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n 1962(c),  but  the  entities   alleged  as  the  enterprise  are\n\ndifferent.  In contrast to these substantive violations, Count IX\r                                                      \n\nalleges a RICO conspiracy under  1962(d).\r                                   \n\n          Since  each  of  the  three  counts requires  different\n\nelements  of proof, the  appellants are  incorrect when  they say\n\nthat  the dismissal  of one  of these  counts, namely  Count VII,\n\nrequires the dismissal of one or both of the other two counts.\r                  \n\n          Although the appellants' argument  fails as a matter of\n\nlaw,  we  proceed  to  consider the  possibility  of  some  other\n\nimplicit premise that may  have led to such a  patently incorrect\n\nstatement of law.\n\n          One  premise  that  may  be  inferred  from appellants'\n\nargument  is  that  in  order  to  prove  Count  VIII,  the  RICO\n\nsubstantive violation with Aetna as the enterprise, the plaintiff\n\nhad to prove the  same relationships between the defendants  that\n\nwere essential  to the association-in-fact enterprise  alleged in\n\nCount VII.  This assumption is incorrect.\n\n          Section  1961 defines an  \"enterprise\" for the purposes\n\nof RICO to include \"any individual, partnership, corporation .  .\n\n. or other  legal entity, and  any union or group  of individuals\n\nassociated-in-fact  although  not a  legal  entity.\"   18  U.S.C.\n\n 1961(4).  Thus  to satisfy  the \"enterprise\" element  of a  RICO\n\nsubstantive violation, a plaintiff may prove either the existence\n\nof a  legal entity,  such as  a corporation, or  that a  group of\r                                                         \n\nindividuals  were   associated-in-fact.     Since   Aetna  is   a\n\ncorporation, Aetna can constitute an \"enterprise\" for the purpose\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nof Count VIII, even  if there is  no proof of an  association-in-\n\nfact enterprise.  \n\n          In   contrast,   Count  VII   requires   proof   of  an\n\nassociation-in-fact    enterprise.       An   association-in-fact\n\nenterprise   is   an   \"ongoing   organization,\"   with   members\n\n\"function[ing]  as a  continuing  unit,\" which  is \"separate  and\n\napart  from  the pattern  of racketeering  in which  it engages.\"\n\nUnited States v.

Since different  proof is  required  to establish  these\n\ndifferent kinds of an enterprise, the  court's determination as a\n\nmatter of  law  in  favor  of the  defendants  on  Count  VII  is\n\nconsistent  with  the  court's  determination  that  fact  issues\n\nremained for the jury to decide with respect to Count VIII.\n\n          Another  possible  premise,  which  is  not  explicitly\n\narticulated  or acknowledged by the appellants,  is that in order\n\nto prove a RICO conspiracy of the scope alleged in  Count IX, the\n\nplaintiff was required to prove the existence  of an association-\n\nin-fact enterprise of that same scope.\n\n          This premise is  not valid.   Section 1962(d) does  not\n\nrequire  proof   of  an  association-in-fact   enterprise.    Any\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nenterprise meeting the definition of enterprise in  1961 will do.\n\nUnder  1961 an  enterprise may include a  legitimate legal entity\n\nlike  Aetna as  the victim  of the  racketeering activity.   This\n\ncourt has  previously upheld convictions under  both  1962(c) and\n\n 1962(d), that alleged a victim enterprise like Aetna.\n\n            See United States  v.

In the  case at\n\nhand,  proving a RICO conspiracy with Aetna as the enterprise was\n\nsufficient.\n\n          For these reasons, the trial judge's ruling as a matter\n\nof law for  defendants on Count VII, based on the conclusion that\n\nthere was not  enough evidence to go to the jury on the theory of\n\nan  \"association-in-fact\" enterprise, is entirely consistent with\n\nthe jury findings of a  1962(c) substantive violation (with Aetna\n\nas the  victim enterprise)  and of  a   1962(d) conspiracy  (with\n\nAetna as the victim enterprise).\n\n          C.

In the  present case,  on the  other hand,\n\nplaintiff alleged that defendants who were not employees of Aetna\n\n(the enterprise  in Count VIII) knowingly  joined the conspiracy.\n\nFor this reason we have addressed the issue more precisely in our\n\nformulation, stated above, of the elements  of a RICO conspiracy,\n\nas applied to this case.\n\n          We  conclude that  the issue  we must  consider is  not\n\nwhether the defendants knowingly joined the victim enterprise (as\n\nfirst  phrased in Boylan) but  (as later stated  in that Opinion)\r                                  \n\nwhether  the  defendants  knowingly  joined  a  conspiracy.

The major difference between a\n\nviolation of  1962(c) itself (such as Count VIII) and a violation\n\nof  1962(d) based on  1962(c)(such as Count IX) is the additional\n\nrequired element that the defendant knowingly joined a conspiracy\n\nto violate  1962(c).  Another difference is that, to prove that a\n\ndefendant violated  1962(c), it is necessary for the plaintiff to\n\nprove two  predicate offenses; under  1962(d),  in contrast, this\n\nis not an element required to be proved.  To prove a violation of\n\n 1962(d), it is enough to prove that a defendant agreed with  one\r                                                                 \n\nor more others  that two  predicate offenses be  committed.

In the  present case,  this  latter\r                \n\ndifference  is of  no practical  consequence because  we conclude\n\nthat there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that each\n\ndefendant in fact committed two predicate offenses.\n\n          One  assertion,  perhaps  implicit in  the  appellants'\n\nargument,  is that, in order  to prove each  defendant liable for\n\nRICO   conspiracy  (a   1962(d)  violation),  the  plaintiff  was\n\nrequired to prove  a conspiracy to defraud Aetna in which each of\n\nthe  Arsenal  defendants  conspired  directly with  one  or  more\n\npersons associated with each of the other body shops.\n\n          This   assertion  is   incorrect  because   it  depends\n\nnecessarily upon a misinterpretation  of  1962(d) with respect to\n\nthe  elements necessary to prove  a RICO conspiracy.

In this\r                            \n\ncase,  the jury reasonably  could have found  that, although each\n\ndefendant  may not have known the entire sweep of the conspiracy,\n\neach  defendant  knew that  he  or she  was  a part  of  a larger\n\nfraudulent scheme.   For example, since the  evidence supported a\n\nfinding that each of the Arsenal defendants was well aware of the\n\nfraudulent business  practices of  Dexter and Cummings,  the jury\n\ncould find that all of the Arsenal defendants knew they were part\n\nof a larger conspiracy  in which other persons made  uses similar\n\nto their own  of fraudulent  appraisals by  Dexter, Cummings,  or\n\nboth.\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\n          A   defendant   who   does   not   know   the   \"entire\n\nconspiratorial  sweep\"  is  nevertheless  jointly  and  severally\n\nliable, in the civil context, for all acts  in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.  Using a  common metaphor, one may say  that Cummings\n\nand Dexter, the Aetna appraisers, were  at the hub of the overall\n\nRICO conspiracy,  providing the  central point through  which all\n\nthe defendant body shops were connected.  A jury could reasonably\n\nfind that, through Cummings  and Dexter, the conspiratorial sweep\n\nextended  to all  the body  shops  and most,  if not  all of  the\n\nindividual defendants.  The jury in this case found that the RICO\n\nconspiracy included all other appellants, except for Arsenal Auto\n\nRepairs,  Inc. and  Betty  Arhaggelidis.   We  need not  consider\n\nwhether the evidence would have supported a finding against these\n\ntwo appellants as well.  That was not  essential to the liability\n\nof  others under this theory,  nor to the  liability of these two\n\nappellants under a different theory.\n\n          From evidence  of the  extensive dealings of  all other\n\nappellants with Cummings and Dexter, the jury could have inferred\n\nan  agreement,  to  defraud  Aetna,  among  all  of  the  Arsenal\n\ndefendants (Arhaggelidis not being  an Arsenal defendant) and the\n\nappraisers.    Through  evidence   of  each  individual   Arsenal\n\ndefendant's actions, the jury could infer that each defendant had\n\nthe  requisite state of mind  for a RICO  conspiracy violation --\n\nknowing participation.\n\n            See   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Boylan,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  at   <span class=\"page\">242</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (\"[The\r                                  \n          plaintiff]  may  prove  [a  RICO  conspiracy]\n          through the use  of circumstantial  evidence,\n          so  long as  the  total  evidence,  including\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\n          reasonable   inferences,  is   sufficient  to\n          warrant [the jury's findings].\").\n\n          The appellants do not  dispute that Dexter and Cummings\n\nconspired  with the owners and operators of the other body shops.\n\nThrough Dexter  and Cummings, the Arsenal  defendants were linked\n\nto  all the  other  defendants who  were  found liable  for  RICO\n\nconspiracy.   Thus, upon proof  that each defendant  committed or\n\nagreed  to  the  commission   of  two  predicate  offenses,  each\n\ndefendant could be held liable for the overall RICO conspiracy.\n\n          Moreover,   although  it  was  not  necessary  for  the\n\nplaintiff to  prove that the Arsenal defendants knew the identity\n\nof defendants from  the other body  shops and conspired  directly\n\nwith them, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to infer that\n\nthis  was in  fact  the  case.    For  example,  Zareh  Tirinkian\n\ntestified that  he frequently  attended parties and  other social\n\nengagements with the operators of the other body shops.  Although\n\nTirinkian denied  discussing his  practice  of filing  fraudulent\n\ninsurance claims with  the other body  shop owners, the  evidence\n\nshowed  that   the  body  shops'  racketeering   activities  were\n\nunusually similar.   The  body shops  all  defrauded Aetna,  they\n\nreported nearly  identical types  of fraudulent claims,  and they\n\nobtained  appraisals from the same appraisers.  Evidence of these\n\nsimilarities,   considered  along   with   other  evidence,   was\n\nsufficient to  support a jury finding that the owners of the body\n\nshops conspired directly with one another.\n\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 242 </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(a jury may infer that  a single\r                         \n          overall conspiracy existed  when evidence  of\n          racketeering   acts   shows   \"hallmarks   of\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\n          similarity\"  and  \"a  significant  degree  of\n          interconnectedness\").\n\n          E.

Plus  for\n          conspiracy . . . somebody has to do something\n          to attempt to make it come about.\n\n(App. 4817-18).\n\nAlthough  this  instruction  is  not  precisely  in  accord  with\n\nRestatement   876,  the appellant  has  not  presented any  issue\n\nbefore this court regarding  the instruction.  In any  event, she\n\nwould be precluded from doing so here, not having objected to the\n\ninstruction in the district court.  Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 51.\n\n          She  did, however,  challenge  the  sufficiency of  the\n\nevidence  by her  motion for  judgment as  a matter  of law.   We\n\nconclude, nevertheless,  that we  need not determine  the precise\n\nstate of Massachusetts  law on concerted action  in tort, because\n\nunder  any plausible  formulation  of Massachusetts  law, a  jury\n\nreasonably could  find that  Betty Arhaggelidis acted  in concert\n\nwith  her  husband and  fellow  Rodco/P&amp;B  Autobody defendant  to\n\ndefraud Aetna.\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\n          The  jury,   with  support  in  evidence,   found  that\n\nRodco/P&amp;B  Autobody was  associated with  thirty-seven fraudulent\n\nclaims that were submitted to Aetna, and that  Betty Arhaggelidis\n\nwas directly involved in six of those claims.\n\n          From the  evidence at trial, the  jury reasonably could\n\nfind  also that  Ms.  Arhaggelidis \"acted  in  concert\" with  her\n\nhusband, the owner  of Rodco/P&amp;B Autobody,  pursuant to a  common\n\ndesign.  All  six claims  with which she  was connected  involved\n\nclaimed damage  purportedly repaired at Rodco/P&amp;B  Autobody.  All\n\nsix  claims were supported by  appraisals by Mr.  Cummings, a co-\n\ndefendant.  Her husband, Petros Arhaggelidis,  allegedly repaired\n\nmany  of the  cars personally.   Evidence  was received  that she\n\nrepresented  to  Aetna that  the repairs  had  been made.   Also,\n\nevidence  was received of other fraudulent conduct on the part of\n\nMr. Arhaggelidis:  he  was a claimant on several  claims the jury\n\nfound  to be  fraudulent, and  he made  payments to  Mr. Cummings\n\ntotalling  over $35,000, which the jury could have inferred to be\n\nbribes.   From the evidence as  a whole, the jury  could infer an\n\nagreement between Betty Arhaggelidis and her husband, under which\n\nthey played different roles, but nevertheless acted together with\n\na common design to defraud Aetna.\n\n              IV.  SUBMISSION OF CLAIMS TO THE JURY\r                        IV.  SUBMISSION OF CLAIMS TO THE JURY\n\n          The Arsenal appellants  argue that only  sixteen claims\n\ninvolving the  Arsenal defendants  should have been  submitted to\n\nthe  jury,  instead  of  the thirty-three  claims  involving  the\n\nArsenal  defendants on which evidence  was heard.  The appellants\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\ncorrectly assert  that only sixteen of  these thirty-three claims\n\nwere made to Aetna; the other seventeen claims were made to other\n\ninsurance  companies  (except   for  Tareh  Tirinkian's  worker's\n\ncompensation claim).\n\n          Aetna  recovered  damages  for  the  sixteen automobile\n\ninsurance claims  paid by Aetna  -- claims the  jury found  to be\n\nfraudulent.    The trial  court  admitted evidence  of  the other\n\nseventeen claims  because each was relevant  to the determination\n\nof fraud with respect to one  or more of the sixteen Aetna claims\n\nat issue.   For  example, many of  the claims to  other insurance\n\ncompanies duplicated  one or more of the claims to Aetna.  In one\n\nor more  instances, damage that  was allegedly  sustained in  one\n\naccident  was later reported to  Aetna in connection with another\n\nalleged accident.  On this appeal we need  not decide whether the\n\ndistrict   court   was   correct  in   admitting   the   evidence\n\ncorresponding to  each of the seventeen  claims because, although\n\nin  some instances the appellants objected to the introduction of\n\nthis  evidence  at trial,  their briefs  in  this court  have not\n\ndirectly challenged these rulings of the district court.\n\n          Instead, the  appellants argue  that  the verdict  form\n\nshould not have asked the jury to determine whether each of these\n\nseventeen  other claims was fraudulent.   We will assume, without\n\ndeciding, that the trial court's inclusion in the verdict form of\n\nquestions about these seventeen claims was unnecessary because at\n\nmost they concerned findings of an evidentiary nature rather than\n\nfindings on  ultimate issues of  fact that had  to be decided  to\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\ndetermine  whether  each element  of  some claim  or  defense was\n\nproved.   Since the appellants do  not even articulate grounds of\n\nan  argument for prejudicial error, however,  much less show that\n\nthey  were in  fact prejudiced  in any way  by the  submission of\n\nthese  seventeen other insurance claims  to the jury,  we have no\n\noccasion to determine whether their submission was improper.  The\n\ntrial  court  did consider  and  reject  the Arsenal  defendants'\n\narguments  that  they  were  prejudiced  by  the  jury's  hearing\n\nevidence  of these seventeen claims.  The trial court allowed the\n\nevidence  because  it tended  to support  a  finding of  a common\n\npattern and scheme of fraud that the  jury might find extended to\n\nall the Aetna  claims and others as well.   Even assuming that an\n\nissue   regarding  admissibility  of  the  evidence  is  properly\n\npreserved for our consideration, we conclude that this ruling was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion.  Nor was it an abuse of discretion to\n\nsubmit to the jury questions about these claims.  It is true that\n\nthe jury's findings with respect to the seventeen other insurance\n\nclaims were not essential to the judgment entered on the verdict.\n\nWe  note, however,  that an  argument can  be made,  although the\n\nappellee  does not advance  it on appeal  (and need not  do so in\n\nview of other findings), that each  of these claims, if found  to\n\nconstitute  mail fraud, would constitute  a predicate act for the\n\npurposes of Count VI, the substantive RICO violation with Arsenal\n\nAuto as the enterprise.   For example, one  could argue that  two\n\nrelated, fraudulent  claims, although one was  submitted to Aetna\n\nand  one  was  submitted  to  another  insurance  company,  would\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\nconstitute a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" through which the\n\ndefendantsparticipated inthe conductof theaffairs ofArsenal Auto.\n\n          In considering the sufficiency of evidence, we need not\n\naddress the merits of such an argument because even when limiting\n\nthe scope  of our  review of  the evidence  to the  sixteen Aetna\n\ninsurance claims, we find  that there was sufficient evidence  to\n\nsupport the finding that each of  the Arsenal defendants violated\n\nRICO  1962(c) by  committing two related, predicate acts  of mail\n\nfraud.\n\n        V.  UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:  MASS GEN. L. CH. 93A\r                  V.  UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:  MASS GEN. L. CH. 93A\n\n          Mass. Gen.

Contrary to the appellants'\r                \n\nassertions, however, the evidence was sufficient for the  jury to\n\nfind that  these  three  defendants were  acting  in  a  business\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\ncontext and engaged in unfair or deceptive business practices  in\n\nviolation of this statute.\n\n          All three defendants were  involved in the Arsenal Auto\n\nbusiness:   Zareh  Tirinkian  was an  owner  and Jack  and  Peter\n\nMarkarian performed  repair  work.   The jury  found that  family\n\nmembers  and  friends of  these  defendants submitted  fraudulent\n\nclaims to Aetna for damages.   Most of these cars  were appraised\n\nby  Aetna appraisers, and most  of the repair  work was allegedly\n\nperformed at Arsenal  Auto.   Many of the  work completion  forms\n\nsubmitted  to Aetna with respect  to these claims  bear the stamp\n\n\"Arsenal  Auto Repairs,\" certifying  that Arsenal  Auto completed\n\nthe repair work.\n\n          Under  Massachusetts law, \"unfair and deceptive acts or\n\npractices\" include acts of fraud.\n\n            See Evans v.

The discovery phase\n\nwas not merely \"sufficiently advanced.\"  It was complete.  And  a\n\ntrial on the liability issues had been completed.  The appellants\n\nreceived notice and  an opportunity  to be heard.   The  district\n\njudge,  before   entering  judgment,   allowed  the   parties  an\n\nopportunity to file written  submissions on the issues  that were\n\nraised at the conference.\n\n          In  their post-trial  memorandum,  the appellants  made\n\nsubstantially the same  argument as they  make before this  court\n\n(discussed below), and in both instances without any proffer that\n\nthey would be able to offer at a damages-phase trial any evidence\n\nthat would raise a genuine dispute of fact that might be resolved\n\nby a factfinder in their favor.\n\n          B.   The Alleged Need for a Jury Trial\r                                                          \n\n          The  appellants argue that a jury  trial on damages was\n\nnecessary  to determine  how much  of each  fraudulent  claim was\n\n                               -49-\r\r\n\nlegitimate,  that reported  losses were  merely exaggerated,  and\n\nthat Aetna's damages should be  limited to the difference between\n\nthe payment made by Aetna  and the actual loss to the  appellant.\n\nEach  of these arguments fails because, as a matter of law, Aetna\n\nis entitled to damages equal to the entire amount of its payments\n\non  fraudulent claims,  regardless of  any portion of  the claims\n\nthat might have  been shown  to be supportable  if no  fraudulent\n\nenlargement of the claims had occurred.\n\n          We put aside Aetna's  argument that appellants violated\n\nthe cooperation clause of the various policies under which claims\n\nwere made.  In part that clause provides:\n\n               After  an  accident  or loss,  you  or\n            anyone  else  covered  under this  policy\n            must   cooperate   with    us   in    the\n            investigation, settlement  and defense of\r                                                               \n            any claim or lawsuit. . . .\r                                          \n\n(App. 4800)(emphasis added).  Earlier automobile insurance policy\n\nforms,  from which this language  in the Aetna  policies at issue\n\ndescended, contained an Assistance  and Cooperation Clause, as it\n\nwas then called.  That clause initially appeared among conditions\n\nthat  applied only to liability  coverages.  The  claims at issue\n\nhere  were  made  under  collision coverage.    No  Massachusetts\n\nprecedent has  explicitly determined  that this clause  in policy\n\nforms like those at issue here applies to collision coverage.  In\n\nthese  circumstances, any  prediction about  whether the  Supreme\n\nJudicial Court  will hold that  this clause applies  to collision\n\ncoverage is speculative, but  we need not make any  prediction on\n\nthis matter  in  order  to  decide  this  case.    We  assume  in\n\n                               -50-\r\r\n\nappellants' favor, without deciding,  that the cooperation clause\n\nin  these Aetna policies does not apply to claims under collision\n\ncoverage.\n\n          The \"cooperation  clause,\" of  course, is not  the only\n\nprovision concerning  the obligations of  insureds and  claimants\n\nafter  an accident  or  loss.   Other  provisions concern  giving\n\nnotice and filing a proof of loss.\n\n          Appellants  contend  that  one or  another  of  various\n\npreclusion doctrines  of insurance law bars  Aetna from asserting\n\nthat making  a fraudulent  claim is  a violation  of  any of  the\n\nprovisions of the  policy under  which the  claim is  made.   One\n\nreason  all of the appellants' preclusion  arguments fail is that\n\non  the facts of this case, as determined by supportable findings\n\nof  the  jury,  every  claim   included  in  the  trial   court's\n\ncalculation  of  the  damages  award  has  been  found  to  be  a\n\nfraudulent claim.  In addition, every claim for which the Arsenal\n\ndefendants  were held liable was made  within the scope of a RICO\n\nsubstantive violation and a RICO  conspiracy, and every claim for\n\nwhich  appellant  Arhaggelidis was  held  liable  was within  the\n\nfinding against her on the ground of civil conspiracy.\n\n          A  claimant,   in  making   a  fraudulent  claim,   was\n\ncommitting a material breach -- indeed, a most fundamental breach\n\n-- of the  contract between Aetna and its  policyholder.  This is\n\ntrue, of course, not only of a claim by the policyholder but also\n\nof any claim under the policy by any other person entitled by the\n\nterms of the policy to make a claim under the policy.\n\n                               -51-\r\r\n\n          A  breach  as  fundamental as  this  is  a  bar to  the\n\nassertion of any further  rights under the contract by  the party\n\nguilty of the breach.  This is a basic rule of contract law.  See\r                                                                           \n\nE. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts 632-38 (2nd ed. 1990).  It applies\r                                        \n\nto insurance contracts as well as other contracts.\n\n          Appellants contend  that  one  or  another  of  various\n\npreclusion  doctrines  developed distinctively  in  insurance law\n\nnevertheless bars Aetna from asserting fraud by the appellants in\n\nthis  case.  This contention  fails because the  jury findings in\n\nthis case have  negated at least one of the essential elements of\n\neach preclusion theory appellants attempt to invoke.\n\n          The jury's findings negate the voluntary relinquishment\n\nof known rights that  is characteristic of waiver in  the classic\n\nsense,   the  detrimental   reliance  by   a  claimant   that  is\n\ncharacteristic of  estoppel in  the classic sense,  the voluntary\n\nchoice of an  option that  is characteristic of  election in  the\n\nclassic  sense, and insurer  overreaching of a  less informed and\n\nunequal  bargainer  that  is  characteristic of  cases  in  which\n\nprecedents  have stretched  doctrines  of waiver,  estoppel,  and\n\nelection beyond  their classic  meaning to favor  a disadvantaged\n\ninsured.\n\n            See generally </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526040\"><a href=\"/opinion/526040/jardines-bacata-limited-v-aniceto-diaz-marquez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  at 92-102, </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">319-23,  586-\r                                       \n          92;\n            John S.

Indeed,  in  view of  the  jury  finding  of a  RICO\n\nsubstantive violation  with Aetna  as victim, if  there were  any\n\nneed or occasion  to invoke principles of  preclusion rather than\n\nordinary contract doctrine to decide this case, the record  would\n\nbe  more congenial  to preclusion  against a  fraudulent claimant\n\nthan to preclusion of any of Aetna's defenses.\n\n          Although  the parties  have not  cited and  we  are not\n\naware  of any  Massachusetts precedent  directly  determining the\n\neffect of  fraudulent claims and RICO violations upon the measure\n\nof  recovery  to which  the  insurer  is entitled,  Massachusetts\n\ndecisions  on analogous  issues support  the judgment  entered in\n\nthis  case.

Although  there may have been some  dispute as\n\nto  the  existence  and  extent  of  any  actual  losses  by  the\n\ndefendants, any dispute about these facts was not material to the\n\njudgment because the appellants' fraud (by either exaggerating or\n\ncompletely fabricating  losses) precluded them from asserting any\n\nright to recover for actual losses under the insurance contracts.\n\nSince no  triable fact disputes remained, the appellants were not\n\ndenied their right to  a jury trial.  The  court's determinations\n\nof the sums  certain to  be awarded against  the defendants  were\n\nproperly made as matters of law  -- that is, by the judge without\n\nsubmission to a jury.\n\n                      VIII.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\r                                VIII.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\n\n          As  a part of the  judgment in this  case, the district\n\n                               -54-\r\r\n\ncourt awarded  $1,500,000 in costs, expenses,  disbursements, and\n\nattorneys'  fees  to  the plaintiff.    Under  the  terms of  the\n\njudgment,  each  individual  Arsenal  defendant  is  jointly  and\n\nseverally liable for the entire amount of $1,500,000.\n\n          The  sole challenge in this appeal to this award or the\n\namount  of it  is  that the  Arsenal  appellants argue  that  the\n\ndistrict  court  improperly held  them  liable for  not  only the\n\nattorneys' fees  expended in  this case but  also the  attorneys'\n\nfees  expended in  a  related case  entitled  Aetna Casualty  and\r                                                                           \n\nSurety Co. v.  Sport Auto  Body, Inc., No.  91-11718 (the  \"Sport\r                                                                           \n\ncase\").  In the  Sport case, Aetna alleged that Sport  Auto Body,\r                                \n\nInc. and  its operators  were a part  of the  same conspiracy  to\n\ndefraud Aetna, which included Arsenal Auto and the other autobody\n\nshops.  The Sport case was consolidated with this case on May 17,\r                           \n\n1992.  Subsequently, the Sport defendants defaulted and the Clerk\r                                        \n\nentered judgment against them.\n\n          The   appellants  argument  fails   because  18  U.S.C.\n\n 1964(c) authorizes the recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees by\n\na prevailing plaintiff in a civil RICO case.  18 U.S.C.  1964(c).\n\nSince  the  Sport case  was  consolidated  with this  action  and\r                           \n\njudgment  was  entered  against  the  Sport  defendants  and  the\r                                                     \n\nindividual Arsenal  defendants for the same  RICO violations, the\n\ndistrict court correctly held  the Arsenal defendants jointly and\n\nseverally liable for reasonable attorneys' fees expended by Aetna\n\nfor   the   entire  suit.      Arsenal   appellants  argue,   but\n\nunconvincingly, that the district court's order of  consolidation\n\n                               -55-\r\r\n\ndid not extend to the phased trial.  The district court  rejected\n\nthe argument, and we find no abuse of discretion in this ruling.\n\n                    IX.  PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\r                              IX.  PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\n\n          Raising  this issue for the first time in a reply brief\n\non appeal, appellant Jack  Markarian challenges the inclusion, in\n\nthe judgment against  him, of prejudgment interest  on the treble\n\ndamages awarded under the  RICO claims.  He argues that since the\n\ntreble  damages  are punitive  in  nature  and not  compensatory,\n\nprejudgment interest is inappropriate.\n\n          The appellant failed to raise the issue either at trial\n\nor even  in his opening  brief, which was submitted  on behalf of\n\nall  the  Arsenal  defendants.    The  first  statement  of  this\n\ncontention appears in this appellant's  reply brief, filed on his\n\nbehalf  by  new  counsel  representing  him  alone.

The district  court  denied the  defendants'\n\nmotion  for judgment  as a matter  of law  on Count  IX (the RICO\n\nconspiracy) and  Count VIII (the RICO  substantive violation with\n\n                               -61-\r\r\n\nAetna  as  the enterprise),  and  the jury  ultimately  found the\n\ndefendants  liable  on  these  theories.   Severing  the  Arsenal\n\ndefendants would  have  required  Aetna  to present  all  of  the\n\nevidence twice in order to prove the scope of the same fraudulent\n\nscheme in each of two separate  trials.  The court's dismissal of\n\nCount VII  in no way, either explicitly or implicitly, determined\n\nthat a separate trial was  needed for any of the  multiple counts\n\nremaining after the dismissal.\n\n          Appellant Arhaggelidis is another  party who asserts on\n\nappeal  that  the district  court failed  to  provide her  with a\n\nseparate  trial.  She, too, is precluded from arguing this ground\n\nbefore this court  because she did not move  for a separate trial\n\nuntil after the  trial had  been completed.   Having never  moved\n\nbefore the verdict  for a  separate trial for  herself alone,  or\n\neven  for the Rodco/P&amp;B Autobody defendants as a group, she is in\n\nno position  to complain now that  she should have been  the sole\n\ndefendant  in a  separate  trial.   Taking  her argument  to  its\n\nlogical  conclusion,  that  each  defendant  should  have  had  a\n\nseparate trial, would  require that Aetna  present and the  court\n\nhear the  same evidence  up  to fourteen  times --  one for  each\n\ndefendant who chose to go to trial.

The conclusion that appellants'  have no basis\r                          \n\nfor relief from the  attachments at this time is  reinforced upon\n\nthe  rejection of other contentions  on this appeal  and upon the\n\naffirmance of  the final  judgment against the  defendants in  an\n\namount greatly in excess of the value of the attached assets.  In\n\nlight of their joint and several liability for $2,369,901.72,  no\n\nbasis remains, if ever there   was one, for an argument  that the\n\nattachment of  their assets should  now be vacated.   Determining\n\nwhat  process  is  due  in  pre-judgment  attachment  proceedings\n\nrequires a consideration of the risk of  an erroneous deprivation\r                                                               \n\nof  property.

With the affirmance of\r                                  \n\nthe judgment against all attacks on other grounds, no longer will\n\nthere  be  any such  risk.   Aetna  has prevailed  and subsequent\n\nevents  have  demonstrated  that  no  unwarranted deprivation  of\n\nproperty occurred.\n\n               XII.   ALLEGED PLEADING DEFICIENCIES\r                         XII.   ALLEGED PLEADING DEFICIENCIES\n\n          The  appellants challenge  the verdict  entered against\n\nthem on Count VI, which alleged a substantive RICO violation with\n\nArsenal  Auto Repairs, Inc. as  the enterprise.   They argue that\n\nthe  district  court erred  by not  granting their  Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion to dismiss Count  VI of the amended complaint  for failure\n\n                               -64-\r\r\n\nto state a cause of action.\n\n          The appellants' argument is  based on what Aetna claims\n\nis a  typographical  error.    Appellants argue  that  they  were\n\nconfused by paragraph 460 of the amended complaint, which alleges\n\nthat \"[e]ach  of the individual  policyholder/claimants named  in\n\nparagraph 38\"  participated in the conduct  of Arsenal's affairs.\n\nParagraph 38 names  Vachig Petrosyans,  but none  of the  Arsenal\n\nappellants.  Appellants  imply that they were prejudiced  by this\n\nerror because they had to \"guess\" at the meaning of Count VI.\n\n          The  appellants'  argument,   which  the  trial   court\n\nrejected four times, fails  again.  Paragraph 459 of  the amended\n\ncomplaint clearly  alleges that Tareh  Tirinkian, Lena Tirinkian,\n\nPeter Markarian, and  Jack Markarian conducted  Arsenal's affairs\n\nthrough a pattern of racketeering activity.  The appellant cannot\n\ndeny that Count VI was directed towards these four defendants.\n\n          Although  Count  VI  does   not  expressly  name  Tarja\n\nMarkarian, the fifth individual Arsenal  defendant, paragraph 460\n\ndoes refer to \"individual policyholders/ claimants\" and paragraph\n\n42 states that Tarja Markarian was a policyholder associated with\n\nArsenal Auto.   Therefore,  appellants' assertion that  they were\n\nconfused  is  both  unreasonable  and  unpersuasive.    Moreover,\n\nAetna's  Pretrial  Statement of  Claims  and  Damages, which  was\n\nsubmitted four  months  before trial,  states  that Count  VI  is\n\ndirected against the five individual Arsenal defendants and lists\n\nthem by name.   In these circumstances, the appellants  never had\n\nany basis for asserting that they were prejudiced at trial by any\n\n                               -65-\r\r\n\nconfusion purportedly caused by the amended complaint.\n\n              XIII.  COURT'S ANSWER TO JURY QUESTION\r                        XIII.  COURT'S ANSWER TO JURY QUESTION\n\n          The  Arsenal appellants challenge  the judgment against\n\nthem on Count  VIII, the RICO substantive  violation with Arsenal\n\nas the enterprise, on the ground that the judge, in response to a\n\nquestion by  the jury during their  deliberations, instructed the\n\njury  that the  Arsenal  defendants  were  not  part  of  such  a\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          Only  one sentence  of the appellants'  brief addresses\n\nthis  issue.  The appellant provides no argument or authority for\n\nits \n\nproposition.    This court  has previously held  that an argument\n\nthat is presented in  \"such a cursory and mechanical  fashion\" is\n\nrendered unpreserved on appeal.\n\n            Gamma Audio  &amp; Video, Inc.  v.

In  response to a written question by the\n\njury, the court  instructed the  jury again on  the various  RICO\n\n                               -66-\r\r\n\ntheories alleged by Aetna  and used a diagram to  illustrate some\n\naspects of his instruction.  Although it is not clear what aspect\n\nof  the response by the  court the appellants'  are attempting to\n\nput  in issue,  our examination  of the  record reveals  that the\n\nappellants'  have mischaracterized or  grossly misinterpreted the\n\ncourt's response to the jury's question.\n\n          From  the  record, it  appears  that the  court  drew a\n\ndiagram representing  the different enterprise theories  that had\n\nbeen submitted  to the jury.  Although  the record before us does\n\nnot  include this  diagram, the record  does include  the court's\n\noral instructions.\n\n          One of the theories  submitted to the jury, but  not at\n\nissue in this  appeal, was that  two or more  of the body  shops,\n\nother than  Arsenal Auto Repairs, Inc.,  constituted the \"Allston\n\ngroup\" enterprise.   The Arsenal defendants were never alleged to\n\nbe part of the \"Allston group.\"  Therefore, the court pointed out\n\nthat the defendants associated with the body shops that allegedly\n\nconstituted  the  \"Allston group\"  did  not  include the  Arsenal\n\ndefendants.    The court's  description  of  the \"Allston  group\"\n\ntheory had no bearing on the Arsenal defendants.  Nothing  in the\n\ncourt's detailed  response to the jury's  question indicated that\n\nthe  Arsenal defendants were not  alleged to have participated in\n\nthe  affairs of the Aetna enterprise.  In these circumstances, we\n\ndiscern no basis to  conclude that the trial court's  response to\n\nthe  jury's question  was inconsistent  with the  court's earlier\n\ninstructions  to the jury, or with the court's earlier rulings on\n\n                               -67-\r\r\n\nthe  theories to be  submitted to the  jury, or with  the verdict\n\nultimately rendered.   Thus, the appellants could  not prevail on\n\nthis issue even if they had preserved it.\n\n                  XIV.  SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE\r                            XIV.

We\n\nalso  conclude  that the  evidence  of an  ongoing  succession of\n\nfraudulent  claims   was  sufficient  to   meet  the   continuity\n\nrequirement necessary  to establish  a  pattern of  racketeering.\n\nAlthough  the  jury found  that  sixteen Aetna  claims  that were\n\nconnected with  the Arsenal defendants were  fraudulent, only two\n\npredicate  acts   are  necessary  to  constitute   a  pattern  of\n\nracketeering.   Thus, we need  only to conclude,  with respect to\n\neach  Arsenal defendant,  that there  was sufficient  evidence to\n\nsupport  findings of the fraudulent nature of two claims in which\n\nthe defendant was involved.\n\n            1.  Zareh Tirinkian\r                                         \n\n          With respect to Mr. Tirinkian, there was ample evidence\n\nof mail fraud.   Mr. Tirinkian  was a key  figure of the  Arsenal\n\n                               -68-\r\r\n\nbranch of  the RICO  conspiracy.  As  owner and  operator of  the\n\nArsenal Body Shop, he was directly involved in all aspects of the\n\nfraudulent  scheme.   Automobiles  were  appraised  and allegedly\n\nrepaired at his shop.  On behalf of Arsenal Auto, Mr. Tirinkian's\n\nname appears on appraisal forms,  agreeing, on behalf of  Arsenal\n\nAuto,  to perform  repair  work.   As  either  an insured,  or  a\n\nclaimant, or a person  aiding an insured or claimant  under Aetna\n\npolicies, Mr.  Tirinkian submitted fifteen insurance  claims that\n\nthe jury found to be fraudulent.\n\n          In  1988, Mr.  Tirinkian  submitted a  claim to  Aetna,\n\nstating that his 1976 Rolls Royce was  hit from behind and forced\n\ninto a guardrail by an unknown vehicle.  Mr. Tirinkian claims  to\n\nhave  driven home after this alleged accident.  Dexter, the Aetna\n\nappraiser, determined that the  car needed  $6,780.92 in repairs.\n\nWhen  called for  a second  appraisal, Dexter determined  that in\n\nfact it needed $12,023.00 in repairs,  $8,090.17 for parts alone.\n\nAt  trial, Mr. Tirinkian conceded that the only part he purchased\n\nwas  an axle  for  $300.   From  this  evidence, the  jury  could\n\nreasonably find that Mr. Tirinkian submitted a fraudulent claim.\n\n          In  1989, Mr.  Tirinkian reported  that his  1976 Rolls\n\nRoyce struck the back of a  BFI garbage truck that sped off after\n\nthe collision.   Mr. Tirinkian received  payment of $20,000  from\n\nAetna for this claim.  The record contains, in addition to  other\n\nevidence  presented  at  trial  supporting  the  suggestion,  the\n\ntestimony of  an expert  witness in accident  reconstruction, who\n\nsaid that  BFI operated no  truck \"that matched  in any shape  or\n\n                               -69-\r\r\n\nform  the damage that [he] saw on  this Rolls Royce.\"  The expert\n\ntestified  also  that  the damage  must  have  been  caused by  a\n\nperson's striking the car,  or driving it into other  objects, at\n\nleast seven times,  at different  angles and speeds.   From  this\n\nevidence,  the  jury could  reasonably  find  that Mr.  Tirinkian\n\nsubmitted a fraudulent claim to Aetna.\n\n          Since the  jury reasonably could have  found that these\n\ntwo   related  acts  of  mail  fraud  constituted  a  pattern  of\n\nracketeering activity, Mr. Tirinkian's  liability on the theories\n\nof RICO conspiracy (Count IX) and RICO substantive violation with\n\nAetna as the enterprise (Count VIII) is established.\n\n            2.  Lena Tirinkian\r                                        \n\n          Ms. Tirinkian  was an officer of  Arsenal Auto Repairs,\n\nInc.  She testified that she performed bookkeeping and accounting\n\nfor Arsenal  Auto, dealt  with insurance companies,  and received\n\nchecks  from them.  From her proximity to the Arsenal operations,\n\ntaken together with other evidence, the jury could infer that she\n\nconspired  with  her husband  and  other  defendants.   Like  Mr.\n\nTirinkian, Ms. Tirinkian was involved in several claims that  the\n\njury found  to be fraudulent.  A  finding that she committed mail\n\nfraud with respect to  two or more related claims  would support,\n\nin  turn, the  finding that  Ms. Tirinkian  violated   1962(c) by\n\nknowingly participating in the affairs of Aetna through a pattern\n\nof racketeering  activity.  We summarize the evidence against Ms.\n\nTirinkian with respect to two claims.\n\n          The Tirinkians  allege that Ms.  Tirinkian's 1979 Rolls\n\n                               -70-\r\r\n\nRoyce  was damaged  twice during transport  by Forge  Motors Auto\n\nTransport -- while being shipped  to the Tirinkian's Florida home\n\nin the fall of 1988 and while being shipped back to Massachusetts\n\nin the spring of 1989.  The second  claim to Aetna alleged that a\n\n$3,306.95 headlight  switch  was damaged  in  transit.   Yet,  at\n\ntrial, the  owner of Watertown Foreign Car Center, Inc. testified\n\nthat he had noticed that the headlights were not working sometime\n\nin the fall of 1988 and suggested to Mr.  Tirinkian that he get a\n\nnew headlight switch.\n\n          It is  Aetna's practice to require the  insured to sign\n\ncompleted work  forms before obtaining  payment from Aetna.   Ms.\n\nTirinkian  signed the completed work forms  relating to these two\n\nclaims  on her  1979 Rolls  Royce.   The forms  stated  that \"all\n\ndamage to my auto was repaired in accordance with the appraisal.\"\n\nAt  trial Ms. Tirinkian testified  that she never  saw the damage\n\nallegedly sustained by this vehicle, nor did she ever see the car\n\nat  Arsenal Auto or  any other auto  repair shop.    She admitted\n\nthat  she endorsed and deposited  in her bank  account the checks\n\nshe received from Aetna  with respect to these claims.   Although\n\nthe completed work form  with respect to the second  claim stated\n\nthat the repairs were completed by Watertown Foreign  Car Center,\n\nInc.,  the  owner of  that shop  testified  that no  repairs were\n\ncompleted there.    From this  and other  evidence introduced  at\n\ntrial,  the  jury  reasonably   could  find  that  Ms.  Tirinkian\n\ndefrauded  Aetna  by submitting  these  two false  claims  on her\n\nautomobile.\n\n                               -71-\r\r\n\n          Evidence of these two acts of mail fraud, among others,\n\nsupported a jury finding of a pattern of racketeering activity by\n\nMs. Tirinkian from which  the jury could find that  Ms. Tirinkian\n\nviolated  1962(c)  and (d).   Thus,  the district court  properly\n\ndenied Ms. Tirinkian's motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\n            3.  Jack Markarian\r                                        \n\n          Jack  Markarian, brother  of  Lena  Tirinkian,  was  an\n\nofficer  and employee of Arsenal Auto Repairs, Inc.  He testified\n\nat  trial  that  he  performed  repairs  and  managed  the  other\n\nemployees performing  repairs, and that Mr.  Tirinkian did mostly\n\npaperwork.  Given evidence  that he was in charge of  repair work\n\nat Arsenal Auto  where many of the cars that  were the subject of\n\nfraudulent  claims were  appraised and purportedly  repaired, the\n\njury  could infer that he knew and participated in the fraudulent\n\nscheme and conspired with his brother-in-law and others.\n\n          In a reply  brief filed  on his behalf  by new  counsel\n\nrepresenting him alone, appellant  Jack Markarian argues that the\n\ndistrict court  improperly denied  the motion  for judgment  as a\n\nmatter of law with respect to him.  He distinguishes himself from\n\nthe  other defendants  in that he  was neither  an insured  nor a\n\nclaimant with respect  to any of the claims the  jury found to be\n\nfraudulent.  His  strongest argument is that the plaintiff failed\n\nto  establish that  he  committed or  agreed  to commit  the  two\n\npredicate  acts necessary  for a  jury to  find him  liable under\n\neither   1962(c)  or (d).   After  close scrutiny,  however, this\n\nargument fails along with all others made on his behalf.\n\n                               -72-\r\r\n\n          It was not  necessary for  the jury to  find that  Jack\n\nMarkarian  committed mail  fraud  as a  principal.   Under  RICO,\n\naiding or abetting the commission of mail fraud  also constitutes\n\na  \"predicate act,\" because aiding  and abetting mail  fraud is a\n\nviolation  of  1341, the  mail fraud statute  itself.  Therefore,\n\nall  we have to decide  is whether there  was evidence sufficient\n\nfor  the jury to conclude  that Jack Markarian  aided and abetted\n\nanother Arsenal defendant in  the commission of two acts  of mail\n\nfraud.\n\n          From  Jack  Markarian's formal  position  and extensive\n\ninvolvement in the everyday operations  of Arsenal Auto, the jury\n\nreasonably could infer that Jack Markarian aided and  abetted his\n\nfriends  and relatives  in  submitting fraudulent  claims.   This\n\ninference is  supported as well by  other circumstantial evidence\n\nintroduced at trial.\n\n          One example  is that  Jack Markarian testified  that he\n\nwas at  Arsenal Auto when the 1976 Rolls Royce was towed in after\n\nallegedly hitting the BFI truck  and that he \"went over\"  the car\n\nwith the Aetna appraiser who arrived  later.  Given the fact that\n\nMarkarian  placed himself at the scene with the 1976 Rolls Royce,\n\nthe jury could infer that he  helped to inflict damage on the car\n\nbefore  the arrival  of the  Aetna appraiser,  who this  time was\n\nneither  Dexter nor Cummings, or that at the least Jack Markarian\n\nknew about and helped to conceal from the appraiser what had been\n\ndone.\n\n          Another  example  concerns  a  check  written  by  Jack\n\n                               -73-\r\r\n\nMarkarian.  At  trial Jack Markarian was asked  about a check for\n\n$9,000 that he wrote to Mr. Keshishian, a person who was involved\n\nwith  two of the allegedly fraudulent  claims submitted to Aetna.\n\nMr. Markarian testified that this check was a loan.  Similarly, a\n\npayment previously made by  Keshishian's brother to Tirinkian for\n\n$13,000 had  been explained as a  loan, but was made  on the same\n\nday  that Mr.  Keshishian  received a  payment  from Aetna  on  a\n\nfraudulent claim  he had  submitted on an  automobile purportedly\n\nrepaired  at  Arsenal  Auto.     The  jury,  not  believing  this\n\nexplanation, could have inferred that the payment by Keshishian's\n\nbrother  to  Tirinkian  was  a kickback.    Similarly,  the  jury\n\nreasonably could choose to discredit Jack Markarian's explanation\n\nfor  his own  $9,000 payment  and infer  that Jack  Markarian was\n\nproviding a kickback to Mr. Keshishian in connection with another\n\nfraudulent claim.  Thus, the jury could infer that Jack Markarian\n\naided and abetted the commission of a fraud upon Aetna.\n\n          In   many   respects,   Jack    Markarian's   testimony\n\ncorroborated that  of his  brother-in-law, Zareh Tirinkian.   For\n\nexample, Jack Markarian testified  that he saw his brother-in-law\n\nworking on the 1976 Rolls Royce after the \"guardrail\" accident in\n\nJune 1988, and  even stated that he himself had  done some of the\n\nrepair  work.   Jack  Markarian  also testified  that  the reason\n\nArsenal did  not  make available  any  autobody shop  records  or\n\ndocuments  for discovery or at trial was that they were destroyed\n\nby  flooding in the  autobody shop.   The jury  could infer, from\n\nJack Markarian's willingness to corroborate  his brother-in-law's\n\n                               -74-\r\r\n\nstory,  which the jury appears  to have discredited,  that he was\n\nactively involved in the racketeering activities of Arsenal Auto.\n\n          As the head of repairs at Arsenal Auto,  Jack Markarian\n\nstood to benefit from Arsenal Auto's obtaining payment from Aetna\n\nfor  work that  was never  performed.   At trial,  Jack Markarian\n\ntestified that he  and his  employees repaired many  of the  cars\n\nthat the plaintiff  alleged, and offered  evidence to show,  were\n\nnever  damaged.  He also  testified to the  general procedure for\n\ndealing with insurance companies,  appraisers, and customers when\n\nan accident occurs.  The jury  could infer that, in his  position\n\nat Arsenal  Auto, Jack Markarian frequently  met with appraisers,\n\nincluding  Cummings  and  Dexter,  and  discussed  estimates  for\n\nrepairs.  The jury  could infer that Jack Markarian, in this way,\n\naided  and  abetted  his  friends  and  relatives  in  submitting\n\nfraudulent claims to Aetna.\n\n          Despite  appellant Jack  Markarian's assertions  to the\n\ncontrary, the record contains ample evidence for the jury to find\n\nthat he  aided and  abetted others  in filing  fraudulent claims,\n\nthereby  committing two  or  more predicate  acts constituting  a\n\npattern of racketeering activity.  Therefore, the jury reasonably\n\ncould find  that Jack Markarian  participated in  the affairs  of\n\nAetna, the  enterprise, in the substantive  violation of  1962(c)\n\nand  in the RICO conspiracy  in violation of   1962(d), through a\n\npattern of racketeering activity.\n\n            4.  Peter and Tarja Markarian\r                                                   \n\n                               -75-\r\r\n\n          Appellant Peter Markarian,  brother of Lena  Tirinkian,\n\nwas  an employee  of  Arsenal  Auto  during  the  course  of  the\n\nconspiracy  except for six months during 1988.  He testified that\n\nhe  had done automobile repair work since  he was a teenager.  He\n\nalso testified  that when  he was  at Arsenal  Auto he  would see\n\nDexter and Cummings, the Aetna appraisers, as frequently as twice\n\na week.\n\n          Appellant  Tarja   Markarian  is  the  wife   of  Peter\n\nMarkarian and  co-owner of their  1970 Mercedes.   Tarja admitted\n\nthat  she  sometimes  worked   at  Arsenal  Auto  Repairs,  Inc.,\n\nanswering phones and running errands.\n\n          The evidence  shows that  Peter Markarian and  his wife\n\nTarja Markarian submitted  six claims on  their Mercedes, two  of\n\nwhich were to Aetna, within  a span of three years, from  1986 to\n\n1988.  The jury found four of these claims to be fraudulent.\n\n          The  first  claim  the  Markarians  reported  to  Aetna\n\nalleged  that their  car  was damaged  while  parked at  a  movie\n\ntheater.   The description of the damage to the car was identical\n\nto that alleged in a previous claim to another insurance company.\n\nSix  months later,  the Markarians  submitted a  second claim  to\n\nAetna  alleging that  their  Mercedes had  been vandalized  while\n\nparked at  the Burlington  Mall.   Fifteen months earlier,  Peter\n\nMarkarian's  sister, Ms.  Garabedian,  had submitted  a claim  to\n\nAetna alleging that her Mercedes had been vandalized while parked\n\nat the Burlington Mall.\n\n          Peter  Markarian testified  that  he repaired  the  car\n\n                               -76-\r\r\n\nafter  both alleged  claims and that  he purchased  the necessary\n\nparts  with  cash.   He  was  unable  to provide  any  records or\n\nreceipts of such purchases.  Tarja Markarian signed the completed\n\nwork  forms for both sets of repairs.   Each form stated that the\n\nrepairs  were completed by Arsenal  Auto.  She  also endorsed and\n\ndeposited  the checks  from Aetna  to the Markarians  relating to\n\nthese  claims.  At trial,  Tarja Markarian admitted  that she had\n\nnever seen the damage on  the car and had never seen  any repairs\n\nbeing  made.  An Aetna investigator who examined the car pursuant\n\nto a court-ordered  inspection, testified at  trial that many  of\n\nthe alleged repairs  had never  been made  and that  some of  the\n\nalleged damage never occurred.\n\n          From the  evidence concerning these two  claims and the\n\nevidence  concerning the  Markarians'  claim  history,  the  jury\n\nreasonably could  infer that  the Markarians participated  in the\n\naffairs  of Aetna  through  a pattern  of racketeering  activity,\n\nconsisting of acts of mail fraud, in violation of  1962(c).  From\n\nPeter Markarian's employment at Arsenal Auto and his relationship\n\nwith  the Aetna  appraisers,  the  jury  could infer  that  Peter\n\nMarkarian  conspired with  the other  defendants in  violation of\n\n 1962(d).  Similarly, from Tarja Markarian' false representations\n\nwith respect to the Aetna claims and her work, albeit limited, at\n\nArsenal  Auto, the jury could  infer that she  conspired with her\n\nhusband and other Arsenal defendants and was a member of the RICO\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          B.   Betty Arhaggelidis\r                                           \n\n                               -77-\r\r\n\n          Much   of  the   evidence   against   appellant   Betty\n\nArhaggelidis has been  described in  Part </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">III.E,</span> supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">.   We  add\r                                                                \n\nhere, some  additional details that further  demonstrate that the\n\nevidence supported the jury's findings.\n\n          In addition  to finding  that Mr. and  Ms. Arhaggelidis\n\nacted  in concert,  the  jury  reasonably  could  find  that  Ms.\n\nArhaggelidis actively  committed common  law fraud by  submitting\n\nfalse claims  to Aetna.  To  establish fraud (the tort  of common\n\nlaw  deceit), the plaintiff must  show that the  defendant made a\n\nfalse statement of material fact with knowledge of its falsity in\n\norder  to  induce  the  plaintiff  to  act,  and  that  plaintiff\n\njustifiably  relied on  the  false statement  to the  plaintiff's\n\ndetriment.   Danca v. Taunton Savings Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1133\r                                                    \n\n(Mass. 1982).\n\n          Betty  Arhaggelidis used  two cars  to obtain  payments\n\nfrom Aetna.  The title to one of the cars, a Mercedes 380 SL, was\n\nin  the  name  of her  mother,  Ms.  Paikopoulos.   The  evidence\n\nsupported  a finding,  however, that  Betty Arhaggelidis  was the\n\nregular driver of the car, her  mother had never purchased a car,\n\nand her mother did not have a driver's license.  When claims were\n\nmade  to Aetna on this Mercedes 380 SL, Ms. Arhaggelidis received\n\nthe  checks  from Aetna  at her  own address,  which was  not Ms.\n\nPaikopoulos's address.  From this evidence, the  jury could infer\n\nthat Ms. Arhaggelidis arranged for title  to the car to be in her\n\nmother's name in order to conceal fraudulent activity.\n\n          One  of the  claims submitted  on  the Mercedes  380 SL\n\n                               -78-\r\r\n\nalleged  that Amir  Lajervardi hit the  parked car.   Thirty-four\n\ndays  later, the car reportedly  hit another parked  car owned by\n\nMohammad Mohammadi.   Thirty-three days after  that, the Mercedes\n\n240D, title to which  was in the name of  Betty Arhaggelidis, was\n\nallegedly  rear-ended by  Rahim  Nima.      At  trial,  Mr.  Nima\n\ntestified that  Mr. Mohammadi was his roommate and Mr. Lajervardi\n\nwas  his  classmate.    Three  months later,  the  Mercedes  240D\n\nsupposedly  rear-ended a  Mercedes owned  by Mr.  Diamondopoulos.\n\nMr.  Diamondopoulos testified  at trial  that the  accident never\n\nhappened.   With  respect  to this  accident, Betty  Arhaggelidis\n\nsigned a \"Total Loss  Affidavit\" and submitted it to Aetna.   She\n\nthen received,  endorsed, and deposited Aetna's  payment into her\n\naccount.\n\n          From this  and other evidence introduced  at trial, the\n\njury  could reasonably  infer  that Ms.    Arhaggelidis acted  in\n\nconcert with her husband to commit fraud and personally committed\n\nacts of  fraud.   Therefore, Ms. Arhaggelidis  was properly  held\n\njointly and severally  liable for all the  claims associated with\n\nRodco/P&amp;B Autobody.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\n\n          In  summary, we  conclude  that none  of the  arguments\n\nadvanced  on  appeal  supports  reversal of  any  aspect  of  the\n\njudgment in this case.  The district court commendably  fashioned\n\nan order for phasing of trial in two consolidated cases, with all\n\ndisputed and  material issues bearing  on liability  to be  tried\n\nbefore  a jury in the  first phase.   In post-verdict proceedings\n\n                               -79-\r\r\n\nanalogous  to a  hearing on  a motion  for summary  judgment, the\n\ndistrict court  correctly determined  that no genuine  dispute of\n\nfact  remained for  jury  determination and  that final  judgment\n\nshould be  entered for  Aetna on  the jury verdict,  establishing\n\nliability, and on the court's  calculation of damages based  upon\n\nfacts disclosed on the record and not subject to genuine dispute.\n\nThe district court's  pretrial order  for phasing  and its  post-\n\nverdict   proceedings  were  well-tailored   to  the  distinctive\n\ncharacteristics of this legally and factually complex litigation.\n\nTogether they  achieved fair and appropriate  adjudication of all\n\nclaims and defenses on  the merits.  Proceeding in  this fashion,\n\nthe court also effected substantial reductions of delay  and cost\n\nfor  the  parties and  the  court system,  an  objective strongly\n\ncommended by Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\r                                                                  \n\n                               -80-\r\r\n</pre>",
