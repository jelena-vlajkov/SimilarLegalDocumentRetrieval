(collectively, \"Mottolo\")\n\nappeal from a district court  judgment declaring them jointly and\n\nseverally liable under  the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\n\nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C.     9601-9675,\n\n9607 (1993), for all  past and future response costs  incurred by\n\nplaintiffs-appellees, the  United States  and  the State  of  New\n\nHampshire (\"State\"), in remediating hazardous waste contamination\n\non property owned by Mottolo.  Finding no error, we affirm.  \n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Mottolo  acquired  a  65-acre  parcel  of  farmland  in\n\nRaymond, New  Hampshire (\"Property\") in  1964.  In  1975, Service\n\nPumping &amp; Drain Co., Inc.  began operations at the Property.   In\n\n1979, the  State discovered \"hazardous [chemical]  substances\" on\n\nthe Property, see  id.   9601(14); 40 C.F.R. pt.  261 (1993), and\n                      \n\ndetermined that  the  contaminants had  been discharged  directly\n\nonto the surface or deposited in leaching  barrels buried beneath\n\nthe  surface.  The State  determined that the  waste threatened a\n\ngroundwater  aquifer feeding  nearby  wells,  and  requested  the\n\nUnited  States Environmental  Protection Agency  (\"EPA\") to  take\n\nremoval and  remediation  measures.    During  the  EPA  cleanup,\n\nalleges Mottolo,  EPA moved drums from  the contaminated northern\n\n                                3\n\nsector of the Property for temporary storage at a staging area on\n\nthe southern boundary pending removal from the Property. \n\n          The United States and  the State filed suit in  federal\n\ndistrict court to recover  past and future cleanup costs,  see 42\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.     9607(a)(4)(A),  naming  as  defendants,   inter  alia:\n                                                                \n\nMottolo, as  \"owner\" and \"operator\"  of the Property  and \"trans-\n\nporter\"  of waste  to  the  site;  and  K.J.

In  1990, the parties  stipulated to  the\n\namount  of past  response costs  incurred  by the  appellees \"not\n\ninconsistent with the national  contingency plan\" ($601,961), see\n                                                                 \n\n42 U.S.C.    9607(a)(4)(A), and the  district court  subsequently\n\n                                4\n\nentered  judgment  declaring  Mottolo liable  for  those response\n\ncosts,  as well as for  any future cleanup  costs appellees might\n\nincur  at the Property.  United States v. Mottolo, Nos. 83-547-D,\n                                                 \n\n84-90-D  (D.N.H.  Dec. 17,  1992);  see 42  U.S.C.    9613(g)(2).\n                                       \n\nAfter the  district  court certified  its  declaratory  judgment,\n\npursuant  to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), Mottolo brought these appeals\n\nchallenging its liability for past and future cleanup costs.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Mottolo asserts  two challenges  to the district  court\n\njudgment declaring  him \"jointly  and  severally\" liable  to  the\n\nState  and the  United States  for all  past and  future response\n\ncosts   at  the  Property.     First,  Mottolo  contends  that  a\n\ntrialworthy issue remained with respect  to his entitlement to  a\n\n\"third party\"  affirmative defense under CERCLA  which permits an\n\notherwise potentially responsible party to escape strict liabili-\n\nty  if  he proves  by a  preponderance of  the evidence  that the\n\ncontamination was \"caused  solely by . . . an  act or omission of\n                                 \n\n[an unrelated] third  party.\"  42  U.S.C.   9607(b)(3)  (emphasis\n\nadded).   Mottolo argues  that even if he  were to concede strict\n\nliability for  the contamination in  the northern  sector of  the\n                                                         \n\nProperty,  the  \"sole\" cause  of  contamination  in the  pristine\n\nsouthern boundary area of the Property was EPA's gross negligence\n                      \n\nin  removing leaching  barrels of  waste to  the latter  area for\n\n                                5\n\ntemporary storage.   Second, Mottolo attempts to employ this same\n\npartitioning approach to establish  that legal responsibility for\n\nenvironmental harm to the Property is likewise \"divisible\"  since\n\npartitioning  would  permit a  reasonable apportionment  of costs\n\nbetween  himself and EPA.   See O'Neil v.  Picillo, 883 F.2d 176,\n                                                  \n\n178  (1st Cir.  1989), cert.  denied, 493 U.S.  1071 (1990).   We\n                                    \n\ndecline to  address these claims because they  were not preserved\n\nin the district court.  \n\n          Section  9607(b)(3)  and   the  O'Neil   \"divisibility\"\n                                                \n\ndoctrine  constitute  affirmative defenses  which  would preclude\n\nCERCLA  liability.  See United  States v. Monsanto  Co., 858 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n160, 168 (4th  Cir. 1988),  cert. denied, 490  U.S. 1106  (1989).\n                                        \n\nYet neither defense was raised in Mottolo's answers to appellees'\n\ncomplaints, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c) (in its responsive pleading,\n               \n\n\"a party shall  set forth . . . any  other matter constituting an\n\navoidance  or  affirmative  defense\"), nor  did  Mottolo  advance\n\neither contention  in response to appellees'  motions for partial\n\nsummary judgment in 1988.1  \n\n          By  contrast, codefendant  Quinn  squarely  raised  the\n\n\"third party\" defense     albeit premised  on unsupported allega-\n\ntions of  a \"negligent\" EPA  cleanup      both in its  answer and\n\n                    \n\n     1In  an  August  1986  memorandum opposing  partial  summary\njudgment (Docket # 176), Mottolo raised two matters:  (1) a claim\nthat  CERCLA  could not  be  given retroactive  effect  to permit\nrecovery  of pre-enactment  response costs;  and (2)  an estoppel\nclaim based on an EPA representative's alleged statement that EPA\nwould not seek reimbursement from Mottolo. \n\n                                6\n\nresponsive memoranda.   Indeed,  the district court  specifically\n\nnoted in  its  August 1988  summary judgment  decision that  this\n\ndefense had been  presented by Quinn alone, not  by Mottolo.  See\n                                                                 \n\nMottolo, 695 F.  Supp. at 625  (\"Quinn asserts that  . . .  EPA's\n                                      \n\nallegedly negligent supervision  of cleanup operations . .  . .\")\n\n(emphasis  added);  id. at  626, 626 n.9  (\"Quinn also asserts it\n                                                 \n\nexercised due  care in its dealings  . . . .\")  (emphasis added).\n\nBut cf. id.  at 627-28 (addressing  Mottolo's distinct  equitable\n                                                                 \n\ndefenses, including  estoppel, waiver, and release).   At summary\n\njudgment  on  the  issue of  liability,  unproffered  affirmative\n\ndefenses to liability normally are deemed abandoned.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited Mine Workers 1974  Pension v. Pittston Co., 984  F.2d 469,\n                                                 \n\n478 (D.C. Cir.),  cert. denied,  113 S. Ct.  3039 (1993);  Pantry\n                                                                 \n\nInc. v. Stop-n-Go Foods, Inc., 796 F. Supp. 1164, 1167 (S.D. Ind.\n                             \n\n1992). \n\n          Mottolo's failure to preserve these affirmative defens-\n\nes  was neither technical in nature nor inadvertent.  Mottolo was\n\nnot entitled  to rely on  codefendant Quinn's  \"third party\"  de-\n\nfense,  because such a defense  is personal to  the defendant who\n                                           \n\nraises it.2  But even  if the rule were otherwise,  Mottolo could\n\nnot claim the  benefit of  a codefendant's proffer  that a  third\n\nparty  (EPA)  was the  sole cause  of the  contamination, without\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     2The district  court  expressly noted,  moreover,  that  the\ncodefendants would be treated as a group only where their \"indiv-\nidual arguments . . . apply to and benefit all . . . defendants.\"\nMottolo, 695 F. Supp. at 618 n.1.\n       \n\n                                7\n\nfirst establishing that \"(a) [Mottolo himself] exercised due care\n                                                                 \n\nwith respect to  the hazardous substance  concerned, taking  into\n\nconsideration the characteristics of such hazardous substance, in\n\nlight of all relevant  facts and circumstances, and  (b) [Mottolo\n                                                                 \n\nhimself]  took precautions against  foreseeable acts or omissions\n\nof  any  such  third  party   and  the  consequences  that  could\n\nforeseeably result from  such acts  or omissions.\"   42 U.S.C.   \n\n9607(b)(3)(a)-(b) (emphasis added).   At the  very least,  there-\n\nfore,  Mottolo  would have  been  required  to present  developed\n\nargumentation and competent evidence that he exercised \"due care\"\n                                    \n\nas an  \"owner,\" \"operator,\"  and  \"transporter,\" see  Pahlavi  v.\n                                                             \n\nPalandjian, 809 F.2d 938,  943 (1st Cir. 1987); see  also Celotex\n                                                                 \n\nCorp. v.

These memoranda are  the only means  by which appellate\nreview of the  district court  ruling    that  Mottolo failed  to\n\"articulate\" the \"due care\" contention critical to his defense   \nmight conceivably have been  rendered practicable.  See  Silva v.\n                                                              \nWitschen,  19 F.3d 725, 728  n.4 (1st Cir.  1994) (appellant must\n        \nbear responsibility  for omitting material  items from  appellate\nrecord) (citing Fed.

In 1975, Service Pumping &amp; Drain Co., Inc. began operations at the Property.  In 1979, the State discovered \"hazardous [chemical] substances\" on the Property, see id. Sec. 9601(14);  40 C.F.R. pt. 261 (1993), and determined that the contaminants had been discharged directly onto the surface or deposited in leaching barrels buried beneath the surface.  The State determined that the waste threatened a groundwater aquifer feeding nearby wells, and requested the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") to take removal and remediation measures.  During the EPA cleanup, alleges Mottolo, EPA moved drums from the contaminated northern sector of the Property for temporary storage at a staging area on the southern boundary pending removal from the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States and the State filed suit in federal district court to recover past and future cleanup costs, see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9607(a)(4)(A), naming as defendants, inter alia:  Mottolo, as \"owner\" and \"operator\" of the Property and \"transporter\" of waste to the site;  and K.J. Quinn and Company (\"Quinn\"), as an alleged \"generator\" of the waste who contracted with Mottolo for its on-site disposal.  See id. Sec. 9607(a)(1)-(4) (listing \"potentially responsible parties,\" who are jointly, severally, and strictly liable for all CERCLA response costs);  Juniper Dev.  Group v. Kahn (In re Hemingway Trans., Inc.), 993 F.2d 915, 921 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 303, 126 L.Ed.2d 251 (1993).  Mottolo and Quinn interposed several statutory and equitable defenses to CERCLA liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1988, plaintiffs-appellees successfully moved for partial summary judgment as to Mottolo's and Quinn's joint and several liability for response costs.  United States v. Mottolo, 695 F.Supp. 615, 631-32 (D.N.H.1988);  see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) (\"A summary judgment ... may be rendered on the issue of liability alone though there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.\").  In 1990, the parties stipulated to the amount of past response costs incurred by the appellees \"not inconsistent with the national contingency plan\" ($601,961), see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9607(a)(4)-(A), and the district court subsequently entered judgment declaring Mottolo liable for those response costs, as well as for any future cleanup costs appellees might incur at the Property.  United States v. Mottolo, Nos. 83-547-D, 84-90-D (D.N.H. Dec. 17, 1992);  see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9613(g)(2). After the district court certified its declaratory judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), Mottolo brought these appeals challenging its liability for past and future cleanup costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mottolo asserts two challenges to the district court judgment declaring him \"jointly and severally\" liable to the State and the United States for all past and future response costs at the Property.  First, Mottolo contends that a trialworthy issue remained with respect to his entitlement to a \"third party\" affirmative defense under CERCLA which permits an otherwise potentially responsible party to escape strict liability if he proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the contamination was \"caused solely by ... an act or omission of [an unrelated] third party.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 9607(b)(3) (emphasis added).  Mottolo argues that even if he were to concede strict liability for the contamination in the northern sector of the Property, the \"sole\" cause of contamination in the pristine southern boundary area of the Property was EPA's gross negligence in removing leaching barrels of waste to the latter area for temporary storage.  Second, Mottolo attempts to employ this same partitioning approach to establish that legal responsibility for environmental harm to the Property is likewise \"divisible\" since partitioning would permit a reasonable apportionment of costs between himself and EPA.  See O'Neil v. Picillo, 883 F.2d 176, 178 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1071, 110 S.Ct. 1115, 107 L.Ed.2d 1022 (1990).  We decline to address these claims because they were not preserved in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 9607(b)(3) and the O'Neil \"divisibility\" doctrine constitute affirmative defenses which would preclude CERCLA liability.   See United States v. Monsanto Co., 858 F.2d 160, 168 (4th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1106, 109 S.Ct. 3156, 104 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1989).  Yet neither defense was raised in Mottolo's answers to appellees' complaints, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c) (in its responsive pleading, \"a party shall set forth ... any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense\"), nor did Mottolo advance either contention in response to appellees' motions for partial summary judgment in 1988.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, codefendant Quinn squarely raised the \"third party\" defense--albeit premised on unsupported allegations of a \"negligent\" EPA cleanup--both in its answer and responsive memoranda.  Indeed, the district court specifically noted in its August 1988 summary judgment decision that this defense had been presented by Quinn alone, not by Mottolo.  See Mottolo, 695 F.Supp. at 625 (\"Quinn asserts that ... EPA's allegedly negligent supervision of cleanup operations....\") (emphasis added);  id. at 626, 626 n. 9 (\"Quinn also asserts it exercised due care in its dealings....\") (emphasis added).  But cf. id. at 627-28 (addressing Mottolo's distinct equitable defenses, including estoppel, waiver, and release).  At summary judgment on the issue of liability, unproffered affirmative defenses to liability normally are deemed abandoned.  See, e.g., United Mine Workers 1974 Pension v. Pittston Co., 984 F.2d 469, 478 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 3039, 125 L.Ed.2d 726 (1993);  Pantry Inc. v. Stop-n-Go Foods, Inc., 796 F.Supp. 1164, 1167 (S.D.Ind.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mottolo's failure to preserve these affirmative defenses was neither technical in nature nor inadvertent.  Mottolo was not entitled to rely on codefendant Quinn's \"third party\" defense, because such a defense is personal to the defendant who raises it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  But even if the rule were otherwise, Mottolo could not claim the benefit of a codefendant's proffer that a third party (EPA) was the sole cause of the contamination, without first establishing that \"(a) [Mottolo himself] exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of such hazardous substance, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances, and (b) [Mottolo himself] took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 9607(b)(3)(a)-(b) (emphasis added).  At the very least, therefore, Mottolo would have been required to present developed argumentation and competent evidence that he exercised \"due care\" as an \"owner,\" \"operator,\" and \"transporter,\" see Pahlavi v. Palandjian, 809 F.2d 938, 943 (1st Cir.1987);  see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552-53, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), factual issues wholly distinct from codefendant Quinn's due care as a \"generator.\"   Even as late as December 1992, however, the district court re-examined Quinn's third-party defense but observed that Mottolo had yet to \"articulate[ ] [a 'due care' argument] on his own behalf.\"  Mottolo, Nos. 83-547-D, 84-90-D, slip op. at 10 n. 6 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and most importantly, there is no suggestion or indication that Mottolo was unable to assert these defenses in a timely manner in 1988, after Mottolo's pre-cleanup handling of the hazardous waste and EPA's cleanup activities had become matters of historical fact.  Nor did Mottolo ever request an extension of time for discovery relating to these matters.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).  Moreover, Quinn's synchronous pleadings and summary judgment memoranda put Mottolo on clear notice of these very affirmative defenses.  To hold that a defendant in these circumstances may bide his time by withholding such liability-negating affirmative defenses until after summary judgment has been entered against him in the district court, and then assert them years later only after an appeal has been taken, would make a mockery of the summary judgment process and do incalculable injustice to opposing parties who have played by the rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court judgment declaring Mottolo jointly and severally liable for appellees' CERCLA response costs must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed;  double costs to appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In an August 1986 memorandum opposing partial summary judgment (Docket # 176), Mottolo raised two matters:  (1) a claim that CERCLA could not be given retroactive effect to permit recovery of pre-enactment response costs;  and (2) an estoppel claim based on an EPA representative's alleged statement that EPA would not seek reimbursement from Mottolo</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court expressly noted, moreover, that the codefendants would be treated as a group only where their \"individual arguments ... apply to and benefit all ... defendants.\"  Mottolo, 695 F.Supp. at 618 n. 1</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Even if these defenses had not been abandoned irretrievably in 1988, and could have been raised for the first time in response to the request for declaratory relief, Mottolo has not included any of his later responsive memoranda in the appellate record.  These memoranda are the only means by which appellate review of the district court ruling--that Mottolo failed to \"articulate\" the \"due care\" contention critical to his defense-- might conceivably have been rendered practicable.  See Silva v. Witschen, 19 F.3d 725, 728 n. 4 (1st Cir.1994) (appellant must bear responsibility for omitting material items from appellate record) (citing Fed.R.App.P. 10(b), 11(a));  see also 1st Cir.R. 11(c)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Indeed, the district court specifically noted in its August 1988 summary judgment decision that this defense had been presented by Quinn alone, not by Mottolo.

At summary judgment on the issue of liability, unproffered affirmative defenses to liability normally are deemed abandoned.  See, e.g., United Mine Workers 1974 Pension v. Pittston Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599117\"><a href=\"/opinion/599117/united-mine-workers-of-america-1974-pension-v-pittston-company-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 478 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Mottolo was not entitled to rely on codefendant Quinn's \"third party\" defense, because such a defense is personal to the defendant who raises it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  But even if the rule were otherwise, Mottolo could not claim the benefit of a codefendant's proffer that a third party (EPA) was the sole cause of the contamination, without first establishing that \"(a) [Mottolo himself] exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of such hazardous substance, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances, and (b) [Mottolo himself] took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 9607(b)(3)(a)-(b) (emphasis added).  At the very least, therefore, Mottolo would have been required to present developed argumentation and competent evidence that he exercised \"due care\" as an \"owner,\" \"operator,\" and \"transporter,\" see Pahlavi v. Palandjian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481995\"><a href=\"/opinion/481995/chahram-pahlavi-v-petros-palandjian/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span>, 943 (1st Cir.1987);  see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 322-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span> </a></span>(1986), factual issues wholly distinct from codefendant Quinn's due care as a \"generator.\"   Even as late as December 1992, however, the district court re-examined Quinn's third-party defense but observed that Mottolo had yet to \"articulate[ ] [a 'due care' argument] on his own behalf.\"  Mottolo, Nos. 83-547-D, 84-90-D, slip op. at 10 n. 6 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and most importantly, there is no suggestion or indication that Mottolo was unable to assert these defenses in a timely manner in 1988, after Mottolo's pre-cleanup handling of the hazardous waste and EPA's cleanup activities had become matters of historical fact.  Nor did Mottolo ever request an extension of time for discovery relating to these matters.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).  Moreover, Quinn's synchronous pleadings and summary judgment memoranda put Mottolo on clear notice of these very affirmative defenses.  To hold that a defendant in these circumstances may bide his time by withholding such liability-negating affirmative defenses until after summary judgment has been entered against him in the district court, and then assert them years later only after an appeal has been taken, would make a mockery of the summary judgment process and do incalculable injustice to opposing parties who have played by the rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court judgment declaring Mottolo jointly and severally liable for appellees' CERCLA response costs must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed;  double costs to appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In an August 1986 memorandum opposing partial summary judgment (Docket # 176), Mottolo raised two matters:  (1) a claim that CERCLA could not be given retroactive effect to permit recovery of pre-enactment response costs;  and (2) an estoppel claim based on an EPA representative's alleged statement that EPA would not seek reimbursement from Mottolo</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court expressly noted, moreover, that the codefendants would be treated as a group only where their \"individual arguments ... apply to and benefit all ... defendants.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2345848\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mottolo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2345848/united-states-v-mottolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">695</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

These memoranda are the only means by which appellate review of the district court ruling--that Mottolo failed to \"articulate\" the \"due care\" contention critical to his defense-- might conceivably have been rendered practicable.
