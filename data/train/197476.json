Upon careful consideration of the briefs and\r\n\nrecord, we conclude that this appeal does not present a\r\n\nsubstantial question.  See 1st Cir. Loc.

O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292,\r\n\n301 n.11 (1st Cir. 1993) (the S 7B1.4 sentencing table is\r\n\nadvisory, not mandatory). In our view, the district court's\r\n\nstatement of reasons for the longer sentence, including\r\n\ndefendant's repeated disobedience, was sufficient and gave\r\n\nadequate weight to the guideline provisions.\r\n\n     The sentence is affirmed.
