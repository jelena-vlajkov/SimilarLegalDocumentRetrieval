Appellant Paul Sekenski, Jr.,  appeals the\n               \n\ndenial   by  the   district   court   of   his   motion   for\n\nreconsideration. We find that we have no jurisdiction to hear\n\nthis appeal.\n\n                              I\n\n     This case  began in December  1988 when the Bank  of New\n\nEngland  Essex [Bank] filed  an admiralty and  maritime claim\n\nagainst the vessel MV  Bobcat, in rem, and against  Northeast\n                                     \n\nAtlantic  Transport,  Ltd.  [NAT],  and   Paul  Sekenski,  in\n                                                             \n\npersonam.   The Bank  sought collection on  a promissory note\n        \n\nmade by  NAT, foreclosure  on a mortgage  on the  vessel that\n\nsecured  the  note,  and judgment  against  Sekenski  who had\n\npersonally  guaranteed NAT's  obligation.   Sekenski  filed a\n\ncounterclaim in December 1988.\n\n     In  March  1990,  the  district  court  granted  summary\n\njudgment to the  Bank on its affirmative claims.   In October\n\n1990, the  court granted summary judgment to the Bank against\n\nthe counterclaim.  Sekenski's motion for reconsideration  was\n\ndenied. In December  1990, Sekenski filed a notice  of appeal\n\nfrom the order denying reconsideration.  After the appeal had\n\nbeen filed, the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC]\n\nwas appointed receiver for  the Bank.  In March, the  FDIC as\n\nreceiver moved this court for a stay of appeal \n\n     unless, and until,  the claims against the  Bank of\n\n     New England, N.A. . . . have been duly presented to\n\n                             -2-\n\n     and disallowed by the FDIC, as Receiver of the Bank\n\n     of  New England,  N.A., pursuant  to  [12 U.S.C.   \n\n     1821(d)(3), (5), (6), and (13)(D)]. \n\nThe motion also noted that  \"this Court has no subject matter\n\njurisdiction  to adjudicate  the [claims] unless,  and until,\n\nthe claimant has completed the claims process.\"   \n\n     In an order  dated April 16, 1991, this  court ordered a\n\nstay of  \"appellate proceedings  until appellant's  claim has\n\nbeen presented to and disallowed by the FDIC, see 12 U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n1821(d).\"   On July  20, 1993, in  accordance with Sekenski's\n\nrequest,  this court  ordered the  appeal to  proceed in  the\n\nnormal manner.  The FDIC now represents, and Sekenski has not\n\ndenied,  that Sekenski  never filed  an  administrative claim\n\nwith the FDIC.    \n\n                               II\n\n     The  Federal   Institutions  Reform  and   Recovery  Act\n\n[FIRREA] governs  the  filing, determination  and payment  of\n\nclaims made against the assets of  a failed institution after\n\nthe FDIC  has been appointed  receiver.  Anyone with  a claim\n\nagainst the  assets of  a failed  institution must  submit an\n\nadministrative  claim to the FDIC within a prescribed period.\n\n12  U.S.C.    1821(d)(5)(C).   This  includes  those who  are\n\n\"continu[ing] an action  commenced before the appointment  of\n\nthe  receiver.\"  12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(6)(A).  \"[P]articipation\n\nin the  administrative claims review  process [is]  mandatory\n\n                             -3-\n\nfor all parties asserting claims against failed institutions,\n\nregardless of whether  lawsuits to enforce those  claims were\n\ninitiated prior  to the appointment of a  receiver.\"  Marquis\n                                                             \n\nv.
