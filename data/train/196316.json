We summarily affirm the  dismissal of the\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\npetition brought by Thomas  A. Faulhaber pursuant to 28  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2255  (1994)    for essentially  the  reasons  set  forth in  the\r\n\nthoughtful  report of  the  magistrate judge,  dated November  4,\r\n\n1994, thereafter adopted by the district court on de novo review.\r\n\nWe pause only to emphasize a few points.\r\n\n          First,  the  rule  is  clear  that  claims  raised  and\r\n\nrejected  on direct appeal  may not be  resurrected on collateral\r\n\nreview under  the aegis of a section  2255 petition.  See Barrett\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  United  States, 965  F.2d 1184,  1190  n.11 (1st  Cir. 1992);\r                            \r\n\nMurchu v. United States,  926 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.  1991), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 502 U.S. 828  (1991); Dirring v. United States,  370 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n862, 864 (1st  Cir. 1967),  cert. denied, 377  U.S. 1003  (1964).\r                                                  \r\n\nThe  petitioner ignores  this rule,  rehashing  several arguments\r\n\nthat this  court previously rejected  as unavailing.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Faulhaber, 929 F.2d 16 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                             \r\n\n          Second, the petitioner's claim  that he did not receive\r\n\nconstitutionally  effective  assistance  from the  attorneys  who\r\n\nhandled his trial and his direct  appeal is bootless.  The record\r\n\nbears witness that petitioner's trial counsel provided him with a\r\n\nstellar  defense, and  that his  direct appeal  was handled  in a\r\n\nthoroughly professional manner.  In no way can the alleged errors\r\n\nin  failing to object  when the financial  instruments upon which\r\n\nthe criminal  charges were based were termed \"checks\" rather than\r\n\n\"drafts\" be said to have affected the outcome of his  trial or to\r\n\nhave lengthened his sentence.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          To say more would be to paint the lily.  On the face of\r\n\nthe  petition,  dismissed as  meritless  by  the very  judge  who\r\n\npresided over Faulhaber's  original trial, Faulhaber can  satisfy\r\n\nneither  the  performance nor  prejudice  prong of  the  test for\r\n\nineffective  assistance.  See, e.g., Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1,\r                                                               \r\n\n8-9  (1st  Cir. 1994)  (setting  forth applicable  constitutional\r\n\nstandard), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 940 (1995).\r                                 \r\n\n          Petitioner also alleges, as before, that the government\r\n\nfailed  to  produce  exculpatory  evidence in  violation  of  its\r\n\nobligations  under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).  During\r                                              \r\n\npretrial discovery the prosecution gave petitioner the benefit of\r\n\nopen access to all its files.   We agree with the government (and\r\n\nwith  the magistrate)  that the  \"undiscovered\" deposit  slips to\r\n\nwhich petitioner  now  alludes either  are  imagined or,  to  the\r\n\nextent  they  exist,  would  most probably  have  reinforced  the\r\n\nprosecution's case if submitted  into evidence.  At any  rate, we\r\n\nrejected  a version of this claim on direct appeal as impuissant,\r\n\nand Faulhaber is foreclosed from  raising it again by means  of a\r\n\nsection  2255 petition.  And,  moreover, the passage  of time has\r\n\nnot increased the potency of the asseveration.\r\n\n          It follows  inexorably that the district  court did not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in denying petitioner an evidentiary hearing\r\n\non the Brady claims.   See United States v. McGill, 11  F.3d 223,\r                                                            \r\n\n225-26 (1st Cir. 1993);  United States v. Burrows, 872  F.2d 915,\r                                                           \r\n\n917 (9th Cir. 1989); Baumann v. United States, 692 F.2d 565, 572-\r                                                       \r\n\n73 (9th Cir. 1982);  cf. United States v. Panitz,  907 F.2d 1267,\r                                                          \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n1273-74 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          We need go no further.   Although hope springs eternal,\r\n\npoints fully considered and properly  rebuffed cannot rewardingly\r\n\nbe relitigated in  perpetuity.   Since this appeal  flies in  the\r\n\nteeth of that truism,  and presents no fairly debatable  issue of\r\n\nfact or law, the judgment of the district court must be summarily\r\n\naffirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r                        \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n",
