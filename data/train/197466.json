Having completed  that task,  we\r\n\nconclude \r                  that \r                      while \r                            Title VII's employment-related shelter might in\r\n\ncertain \r                 circumstances extend to a person who is a partner in a law\r\n\nfirm, \r               plaintiff-appellant\r                                  Margarita Serapion, a partner in the now-\r\n\ndisbanded law  firm of Martinez,  Odell, Calabria  &amp; Sierra  (the\r\n\nFirm), is  not entitled to such  shelter here.  Consequently,  we\r\n\naffirm  the  lower  court's entry  of  summary  judgment  in  the\r\n\ndefendants' favor.\r\n\n          In  explaining  our  rationale,  we  take  a   slightly\r\n\nunorthodox course.   We  begin with the  facts, then  shift to  a\r\n\ndiscussion \r                    of the statutory scheme, and then resume our historical\r\n\naccount \r                 by \r                   describing \r                              the course of the litigation.  In succession,\r\n\nwe thereafter  rehearse the summary  judgment standard, limn  the\r\n\ndoctrinal parameters of the requisite Title VII inquiry,  address\r\n\nthe merits,  iron out  a  procedural wrinkle,  and at  long  last\r\n\nconclude.\r\n\nI.  THE FACTUAL PREDICATE\r\n\n          Serapion \r                            earned \r                                  a \r                                    distinguished reputation as a certified\r\n\npublic accountant  before  deciding  to switch  careers.    After\r\n\ngraduating from  the University of  Puerto Rico  Law School  with\r\n\nhonors in  1982, she joined  the San Juan  law firm of  Colorado,\r\n\nMartinez, Odell, Calabria &amp; Sierra as an associate.  She left  in\r\n\n1983 for a stint in government service but returned in 1985.   In\r\n\nthe interim,  Colorado had departed and the partnership had  been\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nreconstituted.  Approximately one  year later, the appellant  was\r\n\n  mitted                                                        a\r\n\n non-proprietary\" \r                           partner\r          ad       into the Firm as a \"junior\" partner (sometimes termed  \r          \"                      ).  While this status did not give her any\r\n\nequity position, it  did give her some profit distribution  units\r\n\n(PDUs)\r               1\r                 \r                 and \r                     enabled her to participate in meetings of the Board of\r\n\nPartners (a  body which comprised  all the  partners, senior  and\r\n\njunior   in the aggregate, roughly half the Firm's lawyers    and\r\n\nwhich  had  the   ultimate  responsibility  for  management   and\r\n\npolicymaking).\r\n\n          In 1990, Serapion became what is variously described as\r\n\na \"senior\" or \"proprietary\" partner.  Theretofore the Firm's four\r\n\nname \r              partners \r                      (all \r                           males) were the only other proprietary partners.\r\n\nThey \r              enjoyed \r                      equality among themselves in respect to compensation,\r\n\nPDUs, benefits, and  equity, and they promised Serapion that  she\r\n\nwould be elevated to an equal partnership in three years.  In the\r\n\nmeantime, \r                   her \r                       status \r                             as \r                                a proprietary partner brought about several\r\n\nchanges in  her working  conditions:   she received  a 4%  equity\r\n\ninterest in the Firm (ceded 1% by each name partner); she assumed\r\n\npro  rata liability  for  the  Firm's debts,  losses,  and  other\r\n\nobligations;  and she  became a  voting member  of the  Executive\r\n\n     1Each partner received an allotment of PDUs,  and the Firm's\r\nprofits \r                 were \r                     distributed \r                                 periodically to the partners in proportion\r\nto \r            the \r                number \r                      of \r                         PDUs \r                              which each partner held.  These distributions\r\nwere over and above the recipients' base salaries.  At all  times\r\nmaterial  hereto, the name  partners held 100  PDUs apiece.   The\r\njunior partners held varying amounts, ranging from 20 to 45  PDUs\r\napiece.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nCommittee \r                   (a \r                     five-member \r                                 group which was responsible for the Firm's\r\n\nday-to-day management).  When the appellant became a  proprietary\r\n\npartner, the Firm increased  her allocation of PDUs to 75  units.\r\n\nConcomitantly\r                      , she began reaping a correspondingly larger share of\r\n\nthe Firm's profits.  Under  the terms of the 1990 agreement,  her\r\n\nallotment \r                   of \r                      PDUs \r                          (and, \r                                therefore, her share of the profits) was to\r\n\ncontinue \r                  to \r                     rise in increments until the end of 1992 when Serapion\r\n\nwould achieve full parity with the four name partners.\r\n\n          Despite these emoluments, Serapion was not on an  equal\r\n\nfooting \r                 with \r                      the name partners.  Each of them had a greater equity\r\n\ninterest (24% apiece) and a more munificent compensation  package\r\n\n(roughly one-third  higher than hers  in 1990,  although the  gap\r\n\ngradually \r                   closed).  The difference in compensation was largely, if\r\n\nnot entirely,  a function of  the disparate  allocation of  PDUs.\r\n\nStill, although her allotment of  PDUs was less than that of  the\r\n\nname partners, it was nonetheless significantly greater than that\r\n\nof even the most well-endowed junior partner.\r\n\n          Serapion alleges  that three of  her partners (Fred  H.\r\n\nMartinez, Lawrence Odell, and Jose Luis Calabria) never  intended\r\n\nthat a  woman would  achieve parity.   These partners, she  says,\r\n\nconnived to prevent her  from reaping the fruits of her  bargain,\r\n\neventually demanding that she sign an agreement which would  have\r\n\nsignificantly diminished  her authority  within the  Firm.   When\r\n\nSerapion \r                  stood her ground, the trio caused the Firm to dissolve in\r\n\n1992 (shortly  before the expiration  of the three-year  phase-in\r\n\nperiod)  and  simultaneously  forged  a  new  partnership  called\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n\"Martinez, \r                    Odell &amp; Calabria.\"  The nascent firm included the three\r\n\nmen, \r              as \r                 well \r                      as \r                        most \r                             of \r                                the Firm's other lawyers.  The founders did\r\n\nnot invite either Serapion  or Sierra (the remaining  proprietary\r\n\npartner) to join.\r\n\nII.  THE STATUTORY SCHEME\r\n\n          We \r                      pause \r                            at \r                               this juncture to sketch the legal landscape.\r\n\nTitle VII is one of the brightest stars in the firmament of  this\r\n\nnation's antidiscrimination laws.   Generally  speaking, it  bars\r\n\ncertain  employment-related actions  undertaken on  the basis  of\r\n\nimpermissible\r                       criteria (such as gender).  See, e.g., Smith v. F.W.\r\n\nMorse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, 420 (1st Cir. 1996).  In relevant part,\r\n\nTitle VII provides:\r\n\n               It  shall  be  an  unlawful   employment\r\n          practice for an employer  \r\n                    (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to\r\n          discharge  any individual,  or  otherwise  to\r\n          discriminate  against  any  individual   with\r\n          respect   to    his   compensation,    terms,\r\n          conditions,  or  privileges  of   employment,\r\n          because  of such  individual's  race,  color,\r\n          religion, sex, or national origin.\r\n\n42 U.S.C. S 2000e-2(a)(1).\r\n\n          The Firm is plainly an employer for Title VII purposes.\r\n\nAfter all, an employer is defined by statute as \"a person engaged\r\n\nin an industry  affecting commerce,\" and the statute makes  clear\r\n\nthat \r              \"a \r                 person\" in this context can include a partnership.  Id. at\r\n\nS 2000e(a)-(b).  The rub is whether Serapion is an employee.\r\n\n          Although the  language we  have quoted  speaks of  \"any\r\n\nindividual,\" courts long ago concluded that Title VII is directed\r\n\nat, and only  protects, employees and potential employees.   See,\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ne.g.\r             , \r               Vera-Lozano\r                          \r                          v. \r                             Inte\r                                 rnational Broad., 50 F.3d 67, 69 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1995); Broussard v. L. H. Bossier, Inc., 789 F.2d 1158, 1159 (5th\r\n\nCir. \r              1986); \r                     s\r                      ee generally Keyes v. Secretary of the Navy, 853 F.2d\r\n\n1016, \r               1026 \r                    (1st \r                        Cir. \r                             1988) (noting that \"Title VII does not presume\r\n\nto \r            obliterate all manner of inequity\").  We know, moreover, that a\r\n\nsingle individual in a single occupational setting cannot be both\r\n\nan \r            employer \r                     and an employee for purposes of Title VII.  See, e.g.,\r\n\nDevine v. Stone, Leyton &amp; Gershman, P.C., 100 F.3d 78, 80-81 (8th\r\n\nCir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1694 (1997); EEOC v. Dowd  &amp;\r\n\nDowd, \r               Ltd., \r                    736 \r                        F.2d \r                             1177, 1178 (7th Cir. 1984); Johnson v. Cooper,\r\n\nDeans &amp; Cargill, 884 F. Supp. 43, 44 (D.N.H. 1994).  Even so, the\r\n\nparameters of the term \"employee\" have proven elusive.  Title VII\r\n\ndefines  an  employee  only as  \"an  individual  employed  by  an\r\n\nemployer,\" \r                    42 U.S.C. S 2000e(f), a turn of phrase which chases its\r\n\nown tail.  See Broussard,  789 F.2d at 1160; see also  Nationwide\r\n\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 323 (1992) (terming nearly\r\n\nidentical language  in the ERISA  statute, 29  U.S.C. S  1002(6),\r\n\n\"completely circular\").\r\n\n          Given \r                         the \r                            unhelpful \r                                      nature of the supplied definition, we\r\n\nare  compelled   to  look   for  assistance   in  other   federal\r\n\nantidiscrimination statutes that  contain similar definitions  of\r\n\n\"employee,\" such  as  the Age  Discrimination in  Employment  Act\r\n\n(ADEA), 29 U.S.C. SS 621-634 (1994), the Employee Retirement  and\r\n\nIncome \r                Security \r                        Act \r                            (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. SS 1001-1461 (1994), and the\r\n\nFair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. SS 201-219 (1994).  We\r\n\nregard Title VII, ADEA, ERISA, and FLSA as standing in pari passu\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nand  endorse  the   practice  of  treating  judicial   precedents\r\n\ninterpreting \r                      one \r                         such \r                              statute as instructive in decisions involving\r\n\nanother. \r                   \r                   See\r                      , e.g., Oscar Mayer &amp; Co. v. Evans, 441 U.S. 750, 756\r\n\n(1979); Lorillard v. Pons,  434 U.S. 575, 584 (1978); Wheeler  v.\r\n\nHurdman, 825 F.2d 257, 263 (10th Cir. 1987); Hyland v. New  Haven\r\n\nRadiology Assocs., 794 F.2d 793, 796 (2d Cir. 1986).\r\n\n          Of course,  we  are not  remitted solely  to  statutory\r\n\nparallels.  There is a developing jurisprudence under Title  VII.\r\n\nIn it,  we detect  precedential  value not  only in  cases  which\r\n\nactually involve partnerships, but  also in decisions which  have\r\n\ndetermined the status of individuals by analogy to a  partnership\r\n\nparadigm (even though the individuals involved were principals of\r\n\nentities \r                  other than partnerships).  See, e.g., Devine, 100 F.3d at\r\n\n80-81; Fountain v. Metcalf, Zima &amp; Co., 925 F.2d 1398,  1399-1401\r\n\n(11th Cir. 1991).  We do  not, however, hitch our wagon to  cases\r\n\ndeciding \r                  whether a particular individual is an employee as opposed\r\n\nto an independent contractor.  That distinction is between  those\r\n\nwho are part of an employer's business and those who are  running\r\n\ntheir own businesses, and the factors central to that inquiry are\r\n\ninapposite here.  See Wheeler, 825 F.2d at 271-72.\r\n\n          There are  also a few  cases which  deal directly  with\r\n\nwhether \r                 a \r                   partner in a professional practice should be regarded as\r\n\nan \r            employee \r                     for the purpose of Title VII (and, therefore, entitled\r\n\nto its safeguards).  The  seminal case is Burke v. Friedman,  556\r\n\nF.2d 867, 869-70  (7th Cir. 1977), in  which the court held  that\r\n\npartners in an accounting firm were not employees vis-a-vis Title\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nVII.  This interpretation received a modicum of support in Hishon\r\n\nv. \r            King \r                 &amp; \r                   Spalding, 467 U.S. 69 (1984).  Although the Hishon Court\r\n\nanswered \r                  a \r                    different question   holding that Title VII precluded a\r\n\nlaw \r             firm \r                  from denying partnership consideration to an associate on\r\n\nthe basis  of her  gender, see  id.  at 76-78     Justice  Powell\r\n\ncautioned that  the majority opinion  did \"not  require that  the\r\n\nrelationship among partners  be characterized as an  `employment'\r\n\nrelationship to which Title VII would apply.\"  Id. at 79 (Powell,\r\n\nJ., concurring).   Since  Hishon, several  appellate courts  have\r\n\nfollowed \r                  Justice Powell's lead and declared, with varying nuances,\r\n\nthat  partners  are not  protected  as  employees  under  federal\r\n\nantidiscrimination laws.  See Simpson v. Ernst &amp; Young, 100  F.3d\r\n\n436, 443 (6th Cir. 1996),  cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1862  (1997);\r\n\nWheeler, 825 F.2d at 263; accord EEOC Decision No. 85-4, 2  Empl.\r\n\nPrac. Guide (CCH) q 6846, at 7040-41 &amp; n.4 (1985).\r\n\n          As  we  visualize  it, the  key  inquiry  is  into  the\r\n\nattributes of the relationship between the partnership and  those\r\n\nwhom \r              it \r                 styles \r                       as \r                          partners.  The method by which this inquiry is to\r\n\nbe conducted     how  a court  determines whether  an  individual\r\n\nlabelled \r                  as \r                     a partner is to be treated as an employee for purposes\r\n\nof Title VII   is an unresolved issue which lies at the epicenter\r\n\nof this appeal.\r\n\nIII.  THE LITIGATION\r\n\n          When \r                        her \r                            three \r                                 former \r                                        partners folded the Firm and dashed\r\n\nher expectations  of proprietary parity,  Serapion sued them  and\r\n\ntheir  new firm  (Martinez, Odell  &amp; Calabria)  in Puerto  Rico's\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nfederal district  court.  She charged  in her complaint that  the\r\n\ndefendants had violated both Title VII and local law.  After  the\r\n\ndefendants' \r                     early \r                          attempt to obtain summary judgment misfired,2 the\r\n\nparties \r                 engaged in pretrial discovery.  Thereafter, the defendants\r\n\nrenewed their  quest for brevis  disposition.   Their new  motion\r\n\nrelied on  alternative grounds.  It  averred that Serapion, as  a\r\n\npartner in the Firm, was not an employee (and, therefore, had  no\r\n\nrecourse to Title  VII).  It also  averred that Serapion had  not\r\n\nadduced \r                 any \r                    competent \r                              proof that gender-based discrimination caused\r\n\nthe \r             Firm's \r                   disintegration (an event which the defendants attributed\r\n\nto  irreconcilable differences  between two  warring factions  of\r\n\nproprietary partners).\r\n\n          Judge Casellas granted the defendants' motion,  holding\r\n\nthat Serapion was not an employee as that term had been developed\r\n\nin federal jurisprudence and that she was thus ineligible for the\r\n\nprophylaxis of Title VII.  See Serapion v. Martinez, 942 F. Supp.\r\n\n80, 84-85  (D.P.R.  1996).   The  court held  alternatively  that\r\n\nSerapion  had  failed  to   make  out  a  prima  facie  case   of\r\n\ndiscrimination under Title VII.  See id. at 85-87.  Finally,  the\r\n\ncourt  refused to  exercise  supplemental jurisdiction  over  the\r\n\npendent claim and  dismissed that claim without prejudice to  its\r\n\npursuit in  the courts of Puerto Rico.   See id. at 88-89.   This\r\n\nappeal followed.\r\n\n     2When the defendants filed their initial motion  for summary\r\njudgment, \r                   Chief Judge Cerezo denied it.  The case was subsequently\r\ntransferred \r                     to \r                       Judge \r                             Casellas' calendar as part of a redistribution\r\nof cases ancillary to his assumption of judicial office.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nIV.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\n\n          While the origins of the summary judgment standard  may\r\n\nhave been important in the distant past, modern federal  practice\r\n\nhas reached a point at which the standard has achieved aphoristic\r\n\nacceptance, rendering  the  attribution  of  specific  authorship\r\n\nsuperfluous.  We thus present the standard without particularized\r\n\ncitation, \r                   referring \r                            readers interested in further exposition to the\r\n\nlong litany of decisions that have placed a gloss on the language\r\n\nof Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56(c).   See McCarthy v. Northwest  Airlines,\r\n\nInc.\r             , \r               56 \r                  F.3d \r                      313, \r                           315 \r                               (1st Cir. 1995) (collecting cases); Coyne v.\r\n\nTaber Partners I, 53 F.3d 454, 457 (1st Cir. 1995) (same).\r\n\n          Summary judgment  is a means  of determining whether  a\r\n\ntrial is actually required.  It is appropriately granted when the\r\n\nrecord \r                shows \r                      that \r                          no \r                             genuine issue of material fact exists and that\r\n\nthe \r             moving \r                    party \r                         is \r                            entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Thus,\r\n\nin \r            order \r                  to \r                     defeat a properly crafted summary judgment motion, the\r\n\nparty opposing it must demonstrate that a trialworthy issue looms\r\n\nas to a  fact which could potentially  affect the outcome of  the\r\n\nsuit.\r\n\n          A trial or appellate court considering the merits of  a\r\n\nsummary judgment initiative  must peruse the record in the  light\r\n\nmost favorable to the  nonmovant.  While this equation must  take\r\n\ninto account all properly documented facts, the court may  ignore\r\n\nunsupported  conclusions,   rank  speculation,  and   opprobrious\r\n\nepithets.  If the evidence, so viewed, reveals a genuine  dispute\r\n\nover  a material  fact    that  is, if  a reasonable  factfinder,\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\nexamining \r                   the \r                      evidence \r                               and drawing all reasonable inferences in the\r\n\nrequired manner,  could resolve  a factual  controversy which  is\r\n\ncritical \r                  to \r                     the \r                        outcome \r                                of the case in favor of the nonmoving party\r\n\n  then summary judgment will not lie.\r\n\n          Where,  as here,  the  district  court  enters  summary\r\n\njudgment, we review its ruling de novo.\r\n\nV.  THE DOCTRINAL PARAMETERS\r\n\n          Putting this appeal into proper perspective requires us\r\n\nto \r            articulate \r                      the \r                          doctrinal parameters which inform an inquiry into\r\n\na partner's status vis-a-vis Title VII.  We divide our discussion\r\n\ninto two segments.\r\n\n                               A.\r\n\n          Partnerships \r                                are \r                                   mutable \r                                           structures, and partners come in\r\n\nvarying shapes and sizes.  Consequently, attempting to  delineate\r\n\nthe \r             circumstances in which a particular partner should be regarded\r\n\nas \r            an \r               employee \r                       for \r                           Title \r                                 VII purposes is tricky business.  Although\r\n\none court has hinted at the desirability of a per se rule, saying\r\n\nin effect that all members of professional services  corporations\r\n\nwere \r              employees for purposes of the antidiscrimination laws (there,\r\n\nthe \r             ADEA), \r                    no \r                      matter \r                             how \r                                 significant a role they played in managing\r\n\nthe \r             affairs \r                     of \r                       the \r                           corporation, see Hyland, 794 F.2d at 797-98,3 we\r\n\nreject the  notion that  labels can  conclusively resolve  status\r\n\ninquiries.  We hold instead that the Title VII question cannot be\r\n\n     3We  note that the Second Circuit appears to have  retreated\r\nsomewhat \r                  from \r                      this \r                           position.   See EEOC v. Johnson &amp; Higgins, Inc.,\r\n91 \r            F.3d \r                 1529, 1538-39 (2d Cir. 1996), petition for cert. filed, 65\r\nU.S.L.W. 3755 (U.S. May 1, 1997) (No. 96-1743).\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\ndecided \r                 solely on the basis that a partnership calls   or declines\r\n\nto call     a person  a partner.

See\r\n\nStrother\r                  \r                  v. \r                     S\r                      outhern Cal. Permanente Med.

After all, form should\r\n\nnot be permitted  to triumph over substance when important  civil\r\n\nrights are at stake.\r\n\n                               12\r\r\n\n          We also reject a variation on the per se theme advanced\r\n\nby the appellant.  She asseverates that, due to the peculiarities\r\n\nof Puerto Rico's civil law structure, all partners in all  Puerto\r\n\nRico partnerships  must be considered  employees for purposes  of\r\n\nTitle \r               VII. \r                     \r                     In a civil law system, this theory goes, a partnership\r\n\nis not  merely a  banding together of  individual partners but  a\r\n\nseparate \r                  entity \r                        which \r                              must itself be considered the employer of all\r\n\nthe individual partners.\r\n\n          We need not  delve too deeply  into the hotly  disputed\r\n\nquestion \r                  of \r                     whether the appellant's construct is sound as a matter\r\n\nof Puerto  Rico law.   It  is enough  for our  purposes that  the\r\n\nconstruct is unsound as a  matter of federal law.  The  appellant\r\n\ncites no apposite  authority for the  novel proposition that  the\r\n\nstatus of an individual under Title VII should vary depending  on\r\n\nthe \r             law \r                 of \r                    the state in which a partnership entity is chartered or\r\n\nin which a  claim arises.   We think  that the  reverse is  true:\r\n\nwhether an individual is an employee for purposes of Title VII is\r\n\na matter of federal law,  and the question must be answered  with\r\n\nreference \r                   to \r                     principles \r                                of federal law.

Ct. 660, 663-66  (1997),\r\n\nresolving the scope of the words \"employee\" and \"employer\"  under\r\n\nTitle VII by  reference solely to  federal statutes and  judicial\r\n\nopinions. \r                    \r                    So, too, in Darden, 503 U.S. at 322-23 &amp; n.3, the Court\r\n\ndetermined the  meaning  of \"employee\"  under ERISA  through  the\r\n\napplication of established  common law principles (rejecting  the\r\n\nidea that the term incorporated the law of any particular state).\r\n\n          These  cases are  merely specific  applications of  the\r\n\nwidely \r                accepted principle that, in the absence of plain indication\r\n\nof  a  contrary   intent,  courts  ought  to  presume  that   the\r\n\ninterpretation of a  federal statute is not dependent upon  state\r\n\nlaw.\r             5\r               \r                \r                See\r                   , \r                     e.g.\r                        , \r                          Mississ\r                                 ippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.

See, e.g., Morgan\r\nv. \r            Commission\r                      er, 309 U.S. 78 (1940).  The appellant has not called\r\nto our  attention any  court which  has accepted  those cases  as\r\npersuasive in  the Title VII  context, and we  decline to be  the\r\nfirst.\r\n\n                               14\r\r\n\n          Our \r                       refusal \r                               to give state law controlling weight on this\r\n\nquestion \r                  not \r                      only comports with the case law but also makes common\r\n\nsense.  Linking status determinations to local law would make  an\r\n\nimportant  federal statute  mean  different things  in  different\r\n\nstates.  This sort  of checkerboarding would undermine  Congress'\r\n\neasily \r                discerned intent that Title VII stand as a national code of\r\n\nconduct in  the struggle to ensure  equality of treatment in  the\r\n\nworkplace.  See  110 Cong. Rec. 13,088-13,091 (1964).   Moreover,\r\n\nsince \r               the \r                   United \r                         States \r                                is home to in excess of 1,000,000 operating\r\n\npartnerships, numbering over 13,000,000 individual partners,  see\r\n\nU.S. Bureau  of the Census,  Statistical Abstract  of the  United\r\n\nStates 535 (116th ed. 1996), relegating status determinations  to\r\n\nlocal  law  would   create  enormous  confusion  and   widespread\r\n\nuncertainty.\r\n\n          In regard to Title VII, there is no basis for departing\r\n\nfrom the precept that \"federal statutes are generally intended to\r\n\nhave \r              uniform \r                      nationwide application,\"  Mississippi Band of Choctaw\r\n\nIndians\r                , \r                  490 \r                      U.S. at 43, and there is every reason for adhering to\r\n\nit.   Here,  moreover, the  possibility  that defining  the  term\r\n\n\"employee\" \r                    by reference to local law would open the door for state\r\n\nlegislatures to adopt restrictive definitions and thereby  defeat\r\n\nTitle \r               VII's \r                     broad remedial purposes militates strongly in favor of\r\n\na uniform national standard.  Cf. United States v. Kimbell Foods,\r\n\nInc.\r             , \r               440 \r                   U.S. 715, 728 (1979) (suggesting that, in cases in which\r\n\nthe  application  of  state  law  would  frustrate  the  specific\r\n\nobjectives \r                    of \r                       a \r                        federal \r                                program, establishing uniform federal rules\r\n\n                               15\r\r\n\nis appropriate).   Thus,  we hold that  the meaning  of the  term\r\n\n\"employee,\" as that  term is used in  Title VII, must be  derived\r\n\nthrough  an analysis  of federal  statutes, legislative  history,\r\n\njudicial \r                  decisions, and common law understandings, not through the\r\n\nlaw of Puerto Rico.\r\n\n                               B.\r\n\n          Having \r                          determined that federal law controls the question\r\n\nof the appellant's status, we  turn next to an analysis of  those\r\n\nattributes \r                    of \r                      a \r                        partner's relationship to the partnership which may\r\n\ninfluence the decisional calculus.   In this endeavor, we do  not\r\n\nwrite on a pristine page.  Two other courts of appeals have tried\r\n\ntheir \r               hands \r                     at plotting the line which divides partners who may be\r\n\ntreated \r                 as \r                   employees \r                             under federal antidiscrimination statutes from\r\n\nthose who may not.\r\n\n          In Simpson, the Sixth Circuit considered the status for\r\n\nADEA  purposes of  an  individual  denominated a  partner  by  an\r\n\ninternational\r                       accounting firm.  In attempting to ascertain whether\r\n\nthe plaintiff, notwithstanding his  title, qualified as a  person\r\n\nprotected by the ADEA, the court weighed factors such as:\r\n\n          the  right   and  duty   to  participate   in\r\n          management; the right and  duty to act as  an\r\n          agent   of  other   partners;   exposure   to\r\n          liability; the  fiduciary relationship  among\r\n          partners . .  . participation in profits  and\r\n          losses;  investment  in  the  firm;   partial\r\n          ownership of firm assets; voting rights;  the\r\n          aggrieved individual's ability to control and\r\n          operate the business; the extent to which the\r\n          aggrieved   individual's   compensation   was\r\n          calculated as  a  percentage  of  the  firm's\r\n          profits;  the  extent  of  that  individual's\r\n          employment \r                              security; and other similar indicia\r\n          of ownership.\r\n\n                               16\r\r\n\nSimpson, 100 F.3d at 443-44.  Concluding that the plaintiff  more\r\n\nclosely resembled an employee than a proprietor   the court noted\r\n\nparticularly \r                      that the plaintiff had no right either to participate\r\n\nin \r            the \r                partnership's management decisions or to vote for those who\r\n\ndid, and that his compensation was not determined on the basis of\r\n\nthe firm's profits   the court allowed the plaintiff to sue under\r\n\nthe ADEA.  See id. at 441-43.\r\n\n          The  Tenth  Circuit grappled  with  the  same  sort  of\r\n\nconundrum in Wheeler, a case which also involved a partner in  an\r\n\naccounting firm.   In determining that  the plaintiff was not  an\r\n\nemployee \r                  for \r                      purposes of either Title VII or the ADEA, the Wheeler\r\n\ncourt \r               focused on her participation in firm profits and losses, her\r\n\nexposure to liability, her investment in the firm, and her voting\r\n\nrights under the partnership agreement.  See Wheeler, 825 F.2d at\r\n\n276.\r\n\n          Other cases,  though  not involving  partnerships,  are\r\n\nuseful in  our analysis.    In Devine,  for example,  the  Eighth\r\n\nCircuit, in deciding whether attorneys who were shareholders  and\r\n\ndirectors \r                   in \r                     a \r                       professional services corporation were employees for\r\n\nTitle VII purposes, stated that courts should \"look to the extent\r\n\nto \r            which \r                  [the \r                      attorneys] \r                                 manage and own the business.\"  Devine, 100\r\n\nF.3d at 81.  The court proceeded to consider factors such as  the\r\n\nattorneys' ability  to participate  in setting  firm policy,  the\r\n\nextent \r                of \r                   their contributions to firm capital, their liability for\r\n\nfirm debts, and the correlation (or lack of correlation)  between\r\n\ntheir compensation and the firm's profits.  See id.\r\n\n                               17\r\r\n\n          In \r                      a \r                       comparable \r                                  situation, the Eleventh Circuit evaluated\r\n\nthe ADEA claim of  a member-shareholder of an accounting firm  by\r\n\nweighing \r                  elements such as the plaintiff's ability to share in firm\r\n\nprofits  and whether  his compensation  was a  function of  those\r\n\nprofits; the plaintiff's liability for the firm's losses,  debts,\r\n\nand \r             obligations; \r                          and \r                             the \r                                 extent of the plaintiff's right to vote on\r\n\nmajor firm decisions.  See Fountain, 925 F.2d at 1401.  The court\r\n\ndismissed \r                   an \r                      assertion that the \"autocratic\" actions of the firm's\r\n\npresident constituted a reasonable basis for concluding that  the\r\n\nplaintiff \r                   was an employee.  \"Domination by an `autocratic' partner\r\n\nover \r              others \r                     is \r                       not \r                           uncommon and does not support a finding that the\r\n\nothers are `employees.'\"  Id.\r\n\n          We  think that  these cases  provide valuable  guidance\r\n\nconcerning \r                    the factors which courts must consider in making status\r\n\ndetermination\r                      s under Title VII.  In large, the critical attributes\r\n\nof \r            proprietary status involve three broad, overlapping categories:\r\n\nownership, \r                    remuneration, and management.  Within these categories,\r\n\nemphasis will vary depending  on the circumstances of  particular\r\n\ncases.   Nonetheless,  although myriad  factors may  influence  a\r\n\ncourt's ultimate  decision in  a given  case, we  recount a  non-\r\n\nexclusive list  of factors that  frequently will  bear upon  such\r\n\ndeterminations.\r\n\n          Under the  first  category,  relevant  factors  include\r\n\ninvestment \r                    in \r                       the \r                          firm, \r                                ownership of firm assets, and liability for\r\n\nfirm  debts and obligations.   To the  extent that these  factors\r\n\nexist, \r                they \r                     indicate \r                             a \r                               proprietary role; to the extent that they do\r\n\n                               18\r\r\n\nnot \r             exist, \r                    they \r                        indicate \r                                 a status more akin to that of an employee.\r\n\n          Under the second category, the most relevant factor  is\r\n\nwhether (and if so, to what extent) the individual's compensation\r\n\nis based on the firm's profits.   To the extent that a  partner's\r\n\nremuneration is subject  to the vagaries  of the firm's  economic\r\n\nfortunes, her status more closely resembles that of a proprietor;\r\n\nconversely, to the  extent that a partner  is paid on a  straight\r\n\nsalary \r                basis, \r                      the \r                          argument for treating her as an ordinary employee\r\n\nwill gain strength.  A second potentially relevant factor in this\r\n\nregard relates to  fringe benefits.   An individual who  receives\r\n\nbenefits of a  kind or in an  amount markedly more generous  than\r\n\nsimilarly situated employees who possess no ownership interest is\r\n\nmore likely to be a proprietor.\r\n\n          Under the third category, relevant factors include  the\r\n\nright \r               to \r                  engage \r                        in \r                           policymaking; participation in, and voting power\r\n\nwith \r              regard \r                     to, firm governance; the ability to assign work and to\r\n\ndirect \r                the \r                    activities \r                              of \r                                 employees within the firm; and the ability\r\n\nto \r            act \r                for \r                    the firm and its principals.  Once again, to the extent\r\n\nthat these factors exist, they indicate a proprietary role.\r\n\n          We add a  note of caution.   Status determinations  are\r\n\nnecessarily made along  a continuum.  The  cases that lie at  the\r\n\npolar extremes  will prove  easy to  resolve.   The close  cases,\r\n\nhowever, will require  a concerned court to make a  case-specific\r\n\nassessment of whether a particular situation is nearer to one end\r\n\nof the continuum or the other.  In performing this assessment, no\r\n\nsingle \r                factor should be accorded talismanic significance.  Rather,\r\n\n                               19\r\r\n\na  status determination under  Title VII must  be founded on  the\r\n\nGiven \r               these \r                     verities, any effort to formulate a hard-and-fast rule\r\n\nwould likely result in a statement that was overly simplistic, or\r\n\ntoo general to be of any real help, or both.  \r\n\nVI.  THE MERITS\r\n\n          To   complete  our   journey,  we   must  undertake   a\r\n\nparticularized\r          totality of the circumstances which pertain in a particular case.\r                         analysis aimed  at determining  whether the  lower\r\n\ncourt, \r                at \r                   the summary judgment stage, appropriately could conclude\r\n\nthat \r              Serapion \r                       was \r                          not \r                              an \r                                 employee of the Firm within the purview of\r\n\nTitle \r               VII. \r                     \r                    Consistent \r                               with the summary judgment protocol, we focus\r\n\nonly on uncontested documentary proof, such as the provisions  of\r\n\nthe partnership agreement and the minutes of the Firm's Executive\r\n\nCommittee meetings  (every page  of which  bears the  appellant's\r\n\ninitials), supplemented  by facts asserted  by the appellant  and\r\n\nthose conceded by her.\r\n\n          The factors  relevant  to  ownership  and  remuneration\r\n\nprovide powerful  indications that  the appellant  should not  be\r\n\ntreated as an employee for Title VII purposes.  It is  undisputed\r\n\nthat Serapion received an equity interest in the Firm upon  being\r\n\nnamed a proprietary partner.  Her compensation was predicated  in\r\n\nsubstantial \r                     measure \r                            on \r                               the Firm's profits,6 and she would have been\r\n\n     6Whereas associates in the Firm received fixed  compensation\r\n(plus an  occasional bonus  based on  performance), all  partners\r\n(senior \r                 and \r                     junior) received a base salary supplemented by a share\r\nof the Firm's profits paid out periodically in proportion to each\r\npartner's \r                   allotment \r                            of \r                               PDUs.  For example, when the appellant first\r\nascended to proprietary partnership, her overall compensation was\r\ncomposed of a base salary ($60,183 per annum) plus a share of the\r\n\n                               20\r\r\n\nliable had the Firm sustained losses.  In the ensuing months, she\r\n\nmade substantial  capital contributions to  the Firm.   She  als\r\n\nreceived very generous fringe benefits, e.g., a car allowance  in\r\n\nexcess of $10,000 per annum and a discretionary expense allowance\r\n\nof $16,400  yearly.   These  benefits  were comparable  to  those\r\n\nreceived by the other proprietary partners, but more  extravagant\r\n\nthan the benefits available to junior partners and associates.\r\n\n          The picture  is  only slightly  less  clear as  to  the\r\n\n                                                                e\r                                                                          o\r          management prong  of the  test.   As a  proprietary partner,  th\r\n\nappellant participated  meaningfully  in the  Firm's  governance.\r\n\nUnlike non-proprietary partners (who were allowed to attend Board\r\n\nof Partners' meetings  but could vote  only on matters  affecting\r\n\ntheir own interests), proprietary partners were guaranteed a vote\r\n\nin \r            all \r                matters \r                       brought \r                               before the Board.  The partnership agreement\r\n\ndescribes \r                   this tribunal as \"the highest policy and decision making\r\n\nbody of the Firm.\"   Furthermore, the appellant's vote had  added\r\n\nsignificance:  if an impasse developed between a majority of  the\r\n\nBoard and 4/5ths of the proprietary partners, the decision of the\r\n\nproprietary partners controlled.   While the appellant  belittles\r\n\nBoard  membership,  voting  status   in  a  law  firm's   highest\r\n\ndecisionmaking  body  is no  small  thing.   The  fact  that  the\r\n\nfirm's \r                profits \r                       (amounting to approximately $30,000 during her first\r\nyear \r              as \r                 a \r                   proprietary partner).  Her total compensation was pegged\r\nto \r            75% \r                of \r                   what the four name partners received (resulting in gross\r\nremuneration appreciably  higher  than that  earned by  any  non-\r\nproprietary \r                     partner). \r                               \r                               Her percentage allocation increased steadily\r\nduring the period  that followed, so that,  at the time the  Firm\r\ndissolved \r                   in \r                      1992, \r                           her \r                               total compensation equalled 92% of the total\r\ncompensation paid to each of the name partners.\r\n\n                               21\r\r\n\nmembership  consisted of  roughly half  the lawyers  in the  Firm\r\n\ndilutes, \r                  but \r                      does \r                          not \r                              dispel, the significance of such membership.7\r\n\n          Serapion's involvement in  management went well  beyond\r\n\nmembership in the Board of Partners.   She served as one of  five\r\n\nvoting \r                members \r                        of \r                          the \r                              Executive Committee, which managed the Firm's\r\n\nday-to-day operations and  regularly decided matters relating  to\r\n\nsalaries,  finances,  fee   schedules,  office  space,   employee\r\n\nperformance, \r                      recruitment, admission of new partners, acceptance of\r\n\nbusiness, \r                   work \r                       assignments, and the staffing of cases.  In a period\r\n\nof \r            about \r                  two \r                     years, \r                            the \r                                appellant attended no fewer than sixteen of\r\n\nthese meetings and wrote up the minutes.  A review of  Serapion's\r\n\nhandiwork \r                   shows her to have been a robust participant in important\r\n\npolicy decisions; for example, the minutes reflect that she  made\r\n\nseveral \r                 motions \r                        anent \r                              the admission of new partners.  The Executive\r\n\nCommittee was  the nerve  center of  the Firm.   The  appellant's\r\n\nmembership on  it,  coupled with  her  degree of  involvement  in\r\n\nmanagement generally,  strongly  suggests  that she  was  not  an\r\n\nemployee. \r                    \r                    So, too, does the fact that she had authority to act as\r\n\nan agent for the Firm and its partners; one manifestation of this\r\n\nauthority was that, after  she became a senior partner, the  Firm\r\n\nempowered her to sign checks drawn on its accounts.\r\n\n          The appellant does not go gently into this dark  night.\r\n\nFor \r             the \r                 most \r                     part, \r                           she \r                               strives to refocus our attention on the ways\r\n\n  \r            \r             \r              \r              7\r               We \r                  take judicial notice of the fact that many law firms have\r\npartner/associate ratios near one-to-one, yet few lawyers working\r\nfor these  firms would  deny  that the  partners enjoy  a  status\r\nfundamentally different from that of the associates.\r\n\n                               22\r\r\n\nin \r            which \r                  she \r                     possessed \r                               less power than the four name partners.  She\r\n\ncomplains that her name was never added to the Firm's name;  that\r\n\nneither \r                 her \r                    compensation \r                                 nor her equity interest ever equalled that\r\n\nof \r            the \r                name \r                    partners; \r                              that she had less authority to assign matters\r\n\nwithin the Firm;  and that  she did not  head any  of the  Firm's\r\n\ndepartments. \r                       \r                       But \r                          this \r                               constellation of complaints assumes that all\r\n\npartners except those equivalent in stature and authority to  the\r\n\nmost powerful partners of a law firm are employees for Title  VII\r\n\npurposes.  The assumption lacks any solid legal underpinning.   A\r\n\nperson with  the requisite  attributes of  proprietary status  is\r\n\nproperly considered a proprietor, not an employee, regardless  of\r\n\nthe fact  that others  in the  firm may  wield more  power.   See\r\n\nFountain, 925 F.2d at 1401.\r\n\n          The appellant also  makes a  closely related  argument,\r\n\nnoting \r                that \r                     she \r                        rarely \r                               got her way on disputed matters and that she\r\n\ndissented \r                   from many decisions.8  But focusing on the fact that her\r\n\nviews  sometimes did  not  prevail  confuses  participation  with\r\n\ncontrol. \r                   \r                   Insofar \r                          as \r                             the \r                                 management prong of the test is concerned,\r\n\nthe \r             hallmarks \r                      of \r                         proprietary status are the right to participate in\r\n\ndecisionmaking  and  the  right  to  have  a  meaningful  say  in\r\n\ngovernance.   Within the structure  of any organization,  certain\r\n\n     8It is disingenuous for the appellant to focus on the number\r\nof \r            recorded \r                     votes taken by the Executive Committee as proof of her\r\nalleged  powerlessness, especially  since  the minutes  of  those\r\nmeetings indicate that the vast majority of policy decisions were\r\nreached by consensus.  General agreement on a matter is certainly\r\ntantamount  to a vote,  and it cannot  be gainsaid that  numerous\r\npolicy \r                decisions were made, often by unanimous consent, during the\r\ntime the appellant was a member of the Executive Committee.\r\n\n                               23\r\r\n\nindividuals \r                     tend \r                         to \r                            dominate others, and the dominators' viewpoints\r\n\nwill \r              more \r                   often be adopted.  See id.  This phenomenon often occurs\r\n\namong equals (Adams reportedly wrote to Jefferson on November 12,\r\n\n1813, \r               describing Dickinson as \"primus inter pares, the bellwether,\r\n\nthe leader of the aristocratical flock\") and, in all events,  the\r\n\nexercise \r                  of \r                     hegemony \r                             by \r                                one partner does not automatically dislodge\r\n\nothers \r                in \r                   the \r                      hierarchy \r                                from proprietary status.  Elsewise, all the\r\n\npartners in a law firm  or an accounting practice, save only  the\r\n\nmanaging partner(s), would be treated as employees for Title  VII\r\n\npurposes regardless  of  the extent  of  their ownership  or  the\r\n\ncorrelation between their remuneration and the entity's  profits.\r\n\nThe law is  to the contrary:  it is not a necessary corollary  of\r\n\nproprietary status that the views of the partner in question will\r\n\nalways   or even usually   prevail.\r\n\n          In this case, all roads lead to Rome.  The evidence  is\r\n\nuncontradicte\r                      d that the appellant had an ownership interest in the\r\n\nFirm; that her compensation depended substantially on the  Firm's\r\n\nfortunes; and that  she enjoyed significant voting rights in  the\r\n\nFirm's two  principal governing bodies.   Given these  undisputed\r\n\nfacts,  no reasonable  factfinder could  conclude that  Margarita\r\n\nSerapion was other than a bona fide equity partner, and, as such,\r\n\na person  ineligible  to claim  the  protection which  Title  VII\r\n\nreserves for those who are employees.  Consequently, the district\r\n\ncourt did not err in granting summary judgment in the defendants'\r\n\n                               24\r\r\n\nfavor on the Title VII claim.9\r\n\nVII.  THE IDENTITY OF THE DEFENDANTS\r\n\n          Before closing,  we  note a  procedural anomaly.    For\r\n\nreasons best known to her, the appellant elected to sue three  of\r\n\nher former partners and their fledgling partnership, but not  the\r\n\nFirm.    This  tactic raises  questions  about  whether  the  new\r\n\npartnership can  be held liable  as a successor  to the Firm  and\r\n\nwhether \r                 law \r                     partners \r                             can \r                                 be held individually liable as \"employers\"\r\n\nunder \r               Title \r                     VII.  The last question, in particular, is potentially\r\n\ndifficult.  Compare Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295,  1314-17\r\n\n(2d \r             Cir. \r                  1995) (dismissing the possibility of individual liability\r\n\nunder Title VII) with  Kauffman v. Allied Signal, Inc., 970  F.2d\r\n\n178, 184-85 (6th Cir. 1992) (suggesting that individual liability\r\n\nexists).  This circuit has not resolved the issue.  See Scarfo v.\r\n\nCabletron \r                   Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 951-52 (1st Cir. 1995) (leaving\r\n\nthe question open).\r\n\n          We need  not enter this thicket  today.  It is  crystal\r\n\nclear \r               that \r                    the liability (if any) of the individual defendants and\r\n\nthe new  partnership cannot possibly  exceed that  of the  actual\r\n\nemployer.  Because Serapion was not an employee, her suit  cannot\r\n\nproceed \r                 under \r                       Title \r                            VII \r                                against any of the individual defendants or\r\n\nagainst the new partnership.\r\n\n     9Because this ground is dispositive of the federal claim, we\r\ntake no  view of the  district court's  alternative holding  that\r\nSerapion failed  to make out a  prima facie case of  gender-based\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\n                               25\r\r\n\nVIII.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further.  Once it had determined that the\r\n\nfederal  claim could  not  go  forward, the  district  court  had\r\n\nsubstantial discretion under 28 U.S.C. S 1367(c)(3) (1994) either\r\n\nto \r            retain \r                   or \r                     to \r                        relinquish jurisdiction over the supplemental claim\r\n\nwhich the  appellant had  brought under  local law.   See,  e.g.,\r\n\nMcIntosh\r                  \r                  v. \r                     Antonino\r                            , \r                              71 \r                                 F.3d 29, 33 n.3 (1st Cir. 1995); Rodriguez\r\n\nv. \r            Doral \r                  Mortgage \r                          Corp., \r                                 57 F.3d 1168, 1176-77 (1st Cir. 1995).  In\r\n\nthis instance,  the court's decision  to refrain from  exercising\r\n\njurisdiction was well within the encincture of its discretion.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r\n\n                               26\r\n",

Having completed  that task,  we\r\n\nconclude \r                  that \r                      while \r                            Title VII's employment-related shelter might in\r\n\ncertain \r                 circumstances extend to a person who is a partner in a law\r\n\nfirm, \r               plaintiff-appellant\r                                  Margarita Serapion, a partner in the now-\r\n\ndisbanded law  firm of Martinez,  Odell, Calabria  &amp; Sierra  (the\r\n\nFirm), is  not entitled to such  shelter here.  Consequently,  we\r\n\naffirm  the  lower  court's entry  of  summary  judgment  in  the\r\n\ndefendants' favor.\r\n\n          In  explaining  our  rationale,  we  take  a   slightly\r\n\nunorthodox course.   We  begin with the  facts, then  shift to  a\r\n\ndiscussion \r                    of the statutory scheme, and then resume our historical\r\n\naccount \r                 by \r                   describing \r                              the course of the litigation.  In succession,\r\n\nwe thereafter  rehearse the summary  judgment standard, limn  the\r\n\ndoctrinal parameters of the requisite Title VII inquiry,  address\r\n\nthe merits,  iron out  a  procedural wrinkle,  and at  long  last\r\n\nconclude.\r\n\nI.  THE FACTUAL PREDICATE\r\n\n          Serapion \r                            earned \r                                  a \r                                    distinguished reputation as a certified\r\n\npublic accountant  before  deciding  to switch  careers.    After\r\n\ngraduating from  the University of  Puerto Rico  Law School  with\r\n\nhonors in  1982, she joined  the San Juan  law firm of  Colorado,\r\n\nMartinez, Odell, Calabria &amp; Sierra as an associate.  She left  in\r\n\n1983 for a stint in government service but returned in 1985.   In\r\n\nthe interim,  Colorado had departed and the partnership had  been\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nreconstituted.  Approximately one  year later, the appellant  was\r\n\n  mitted                                                        a\r\n\n non-proprietary\" \r                           partner\r          ad       into the Firm as a \"junior\" partner (sometimes termed  \r          \"                      ).  While this status did not give her any\r\n\nequity position, it  did give her some profit distribution  units\r\n\n(PDUs)\r               1\r                 \r                 and \r                     enabled her to participate in meetings of the Board of\r\n\nPartners (a  body which comprised  all the  partners, senior  and\r\n\njunior   in the aggregate, roughly half the Firm's lawyers    and\r\n\nwhich  had  the   ultimate  responsibility  for  management   and\r\n\npolicymaking).\r\n\n          In 1990, Serapion became what is variously described as\r\n\na \"senior\" or \"proprietary\" partner.  Theretofore the Firm's four\r\n\nname \r              partners \r                      (all \r                           males) were the only other proprietary partners.\r\n\nThey \r              enjoyed \r                      equality among themselves in respect to compensation,\r\n\nPDUs, benefits, and  equity, and they promised Serapion that  she\r\n\nwould be elevated to an equal partnership in three years.  In the\r\n\nmeantime, \r                   her \r                       status \r                             as \r                                a proprietary partner brought about several\r\n\nchanges in  her working  conditions:   she received  a 4%  equity\r\n\ninterest in the Firm (ceded 1% by each name partner); she assumed\r\n\npro  rata liability  for  the  Firm's debts,  losses,  and  other\r\n\nobligations;  and she  became a  voting member  of the  Executive\r\n\n     1Each partner received an allotment of PDUs,  and the Firm's\r\nprofits \r                 were \r                     distributed \r                                 periodically to the partners in proportion\r\nto \r            the \r                number \r                      of \r                         PDUs \r                              which each partner held.  These distributions\r\nwere over and above the recipients' base salaries.  At all  times\r\nmaterial  hereto, the name  partners held 100  PDUs apiece.   The\r\njunior partners held varying amounts, ranging from 20 to 45  PDUs\r\napiece.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nCommittee \r                   (a \r                     five-member \r                                 group which was responsible for the Firm's\r\n\nday-to-day management).  When the appellant became a  proprietary\r\n\npartner, the Firm increased  her allocation of PDUs to 75  units.\r\n\nConcomitantly\r                      , she began reaping a correspondingly larger share of\r\n\nthe Firm's profits.  Under  the terms of the 1990 agreement,  her\r\n\nallotment \r                   of \r                      PDUs \r                          (and, \r                                therefore, her share of the profits) was to\r\n\ncontinue \r                  to \r                     rise in increments until the end of 1992 when Serapion\r\n\nwould achieve full parity with the four name partners.\r\n\n          Despite these emoluments, Serapion was not on an  equal\r\n\nfooting \r                 with \r                      the name partners.  Each of them had a greater equity\r\n\ninterest (24% apiece) and a more munificent compensation  package\r\n\n(roughly one-third  higher than hers  in 1990,  although the  gap\r\n\ngradually \r                   closed).  The difference in compensation was largely, if\r\n\nnot entirely,  a function of  the disparate  allocation of  PDUs.\r\n\nStill, although her allotment of  PDUs was less than that of  the\r\n\nname partners, it was nonetheless significantly greater than that\r\n\nof even the most well-endowed junior partner.\r\n\n          Serapion alleges  that three of  her partners (Fred  H.\r\n\nMartinez, Lawrence Odell, and Jose Luis Calabria) never  intended\r\n\nthat a  woman would  achieve parity.   These partners, she  says,\r\n\nconnived to prevent her  from reaping the fruits of her  bargain,\r\n\neventually demanding that she sign an agreement which would  have\r\n\nsignificantly diminished  her authority  within the  Firm.   When\r\n\nSerapion \r                  stood her ground, the trio caused the Firm to dissolve in\r\n\n1992 (shortly  before the expiration  of the three-year  phase-in\r\n\nperiod)  and  simultaneously  forged  a  new  partnership  called\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n\"Martinez, \r                    Odell &amp; Calabria.\"  The nascent firm included the three\r\n\nmen, \r              as \r                 well \r                      as \r                        most \r                             of \r                                the Firm's other lawyers.  The founders did\r\n\nnot invite either Serapion  or Sierra (the remaining  proprietary\r\n\npartner) to join.\r\n\nII.  THE STATUTORY SCHEME\r\n\n          We \r                      pause \r                            at \r                               this juncture to sketch the legal landscape.\r\n\nTitle VII is one of the brightest stars in the firmament of  this\r\n\nnation's antidiscrimination laws.   Generally  speaking, it  bars\r\n\ncertain  employment-related actions  undertaken on  the basis  of\r\n\nimpermissible\r                       criteria (such as gender).  See, e.g., Smith v. F.W.\r\n\nMorse &amp; Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196571\"><a href=\"/opinion/196571/smith-v-fw-morse-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420 (1st Cir. 1996).  In relevant part,\r\n\nTitle VII provides:\r\n\n               It  shall  be  an  unlawful   employment\r\n          practice for an employer  \r\n                    (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to\r\n          discharge  any individual,  or  otherwise  to\r\n          discriminate  against  any  individual   with\r\n          respect   to    his   compensation,    terms,\r\n          conditions,  or  privileges  of   employment,\r\n          because  of such  individual's  race,  color,\r\n          religion, sex, or national origin.\r\n\n42 U.S.C. S 2000e-2(a)(1).\r\n\n          The Firm is plainly an employer for Title VII purposes.\r\n\nAfter all, an employer is defined by statute as \"a person engaged\r\n\nin an industry  affecting commerce,\" and the statute makes  clear\r\n\nthat \r              \"a \r                 person\" in this context can include a partnership.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196571\"><a href=\"/opinion/196571/smith-v-fw-morse-co-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at\r\n\nS </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">2000e(a)-(b).

Thereafter, the defendants\r\n\nrenewed their  quest for brevis  disposition.   Their new  motion\r\n\nrelied on  alternative grounds.  It  averred that Serapion, as  a\r\n\npartner in the Firm, was not an employee (and, therefore, had  no\r\n\nrecourse to Title  VII).

It is appropriately granted when the\r\n\nrecord \r                shows \r                      that \r                          no \r                             genuine issue of material fact exists and that\r\n\nthe \r             moving \r                    party \r                         is \r                            entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Thus,\r\n\nin \r            order \r                  to \r                     defeat a properly crafted summary judgment motion, the\r\n\nparty opposing it must demonstrate that a trialworthy issue looms\r\n\nas to a  fact which could potentially  affect the outcome of  the\r\n\nsuit.\r\n\n          A trial or appellate court considering the merits of  a\r\n\nsummary judgment initiative  must peruse the record in the  light\r\n\nmost favorable to the  nonmovant.  While this equation must  take\r\n\ninto account all properly documented facts, the court may  ignore\r\n\nunsupported  conclusions,   rank  speculation,  and   opprobrious\r\n\nepithets.  If the evidence, so viewed, reveals a genuine  dispute\r\n\nover  a material  fact    that  is, if  a reasonable  factfinder,\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\nexamining \r                   the \r                      evidence \r                               and drawing all reasonable inferences in the\r\n\nrequired manner,  could resolve  a factual  controversy which  is\r\n\ncritical \r                  to \r                     the \r                        outcome \r                                of the case in favor of the nonmoving party\r\n\n  then summary judgment will not lie.\r\n\n          Where,  as here,  the  district  court  enters  summary\r\n\njudgment, we review its ruling de novo.\r\n\nV.  THE DOCTRINAL PARAMETERS\r\n\n          Putting this appeal into proper perspective requires us\r\n\nto \r            articulate \r                      the \r                          doctrinal parameters which inform an inquiry into\r\n\na partner's status vis-a-vis Title VII.  We divide our discussion\r\n\ninto two segments.\r\n\n                               A.\r\n\n          Partnerships \r                                are \r                                   mutable \r                                           structures, and partners come in\r\n\nvarying shapes and sizes.  Consequently, attempting to  delineate\r\n\nthe \r             circumstances in which a particular partner should be regarded\r\n\nas \r            an \r               employee \r                       for \r                           Title \r                                 VII purposes is tricky business.  Although\r\n\none court has hinted at the desirability of a per se rule, saying\r\n\nin effect that all members of professional services  corporations\r\n\nwere \r              employees for purposes of the antidiscrimination laws (there,\r\n\nthe \r             ADEA), \r                    no \r                      matter \r                             how \r                                 significant a role they played in managing\r\n\nthe \r             affairs \r                     of \r                       the \r                           corporation, see Hyland, 794 F.2d at 797-98,3 we\r\n\nreject the  notion that  labels can  conclusively resolve  status\r\n\ninquiries.

The  appellant\r\n\ncites no apposite  authority for the  novel proposition that  the\r\n\nstatus of an individual under Title VII should vary depending  on\r\n\nthe \r             law \r                 of \r                    the state in which a partnership entity is chartered or\r\n\nin which a  claim arises.   We think  that the  reverse is  true:\r\n\nwhether an individual is an employee for purposes of Title VII is\r\n\na matter of federal law,  and the question must be answered  with\r\n\nreference \r                   to \r                     principles \r                                of federal law.

In large, the critical attributes\r\n\nof \r            proprietary status involve three broad, overlapping categories:\r\n\nownership, \r                    remuneration, and management.  Within these categories,\r\n\nemphasis will vary depending  on the circumstances of  particular\r\n\ncases.   Nonetheless,  although myriad  factors may  influence  a\r\n\ncourt's ultimate  decision in  a given  case, we  recount a  non-\r\n\nexclusive list  of factors that  frequently will  bear upon  such\r\n\ndeterminations.\r\n\n          Under the  first  category,  relevant  factors  include\r\n\ninvestment \r                    in \r                       the \r                          firm, \r                                ownership of firm assets, and liability for\r\n\nfirm  debts and obligations.   To the  extent that these  factors\r\n\nexist, \r                they \r                     indicate \r                             a \r                               proprietary role; to the extent that they do\r\n\n                               18\r\r\n\nnot \r             exist, \r                    they \r                        indicate \r                                 a status more akin to that of an employee.\r\n\n          Under the second category, the most relevant factor  is\r\n\nwhether (and if so, to what extent) the individual's compensation\r\n\nis based on the firm's profits.   To the extent that a  partner's\r\n\nremuneration is subject  to the vagaries  of the firm's  economic\r\n\nfortunes, her status more closely resembles that of a proprietor;\r\n\nconversely, to the  extent that a partner  is paid on a  straight\r\n\nsalary \r                basis, \r                      the \r                          argument for treating her as an ordinary employee\r\n\nwill gain strength.  A second potentially relevant factor in this\r\n\nregard relates to  fringe benefits.   An individual who  receives\r\n\nbenefits of a  kind or in an  amount markedly more generous  than\r\n\nsimilarly situated employees who possess no ownership interest is\r\n\nmore likely to be a proprietor.\r\n\n          Under the third category, relevant factors include  the\r\n\nright \r               to \r                  engage \r                        in \r                           policymaking; participation in, and voting power\r\n\nwith \r              regard \r                     to, firm governance; the ability to assign work and to\r\n\ndirect \r                the \r                    activities \r                              of \r                                 employees within the firm; and the ability\r\n\nto \r            act \r                for \r                    the firm and its principals.  Once again, to the extent\r\n\nthat these factors exist, they indicate a proprietary role.\r\n\n          We add a  note of caution.   Status determinations  are\r\n\nnecessarily made along  a continuum.  The  cases that lie at  the\r\n\npolar extremes  will prove  easy to  resolve.   The close  cases,\r\n\nhowever, will require  a concerned court to make a  case-specific\r\n\nassessment of whether a particular situation is nearer to one end\r\n\nof the continuum or the other.  In performing this assessment, no\r\n\nsingle \r                factor should be accorded talismanic significance.  Rather,\r\n\n                               19\r\r\n\na  status determination under  Title VII must  be founded on  the\r\n\nGiven \r               these \r                     verities, any effort to formulate a hard-and-fast rule\r\n\nwould likely result in a statement that was overly simplistic, or\r\n\ntoo general to be of any real help, or both.  \r\n\nVI.  THE MERITS\r\n\n          To   complete  our   journey,  we   must  undertake   a\r\n\nparticularized\r          totality of the circumstances which pertain in a particular case.\r                         analysis aimed  at determining  whether the  lower\r\n\ncourt, \r                at \r                   the summary judgment stage, appropriately could conclude\r\n\nthat \r              Serapion \r                       was \r                          not \r                              an \r                                 employee of the Firm within the purview of\r\n\nTitle \r               VII. \r                     \r                    Consistent \r                               with the summary judgment protocol, we focus\r\n\nonly on uncontested documentary proof, such as the provisions  of\r\n\nthe partnership agreement and the minutes of the Firm's Executive\r\n\nCommittee meetings  (every page  of which  bears the  appellant's\r\n\ninitials), supplemented  by facts asserted  by the appellant  and\r\n\nthose conceded by her.\r\n\n          The factors  relevant  to  ownership  and  remuneration\r\n\nprovide powerful  indications that  the appellant  should not  be\r\n\ntreated as an employee for Title VII purposes.  It is  undisputed\r\n\nthat Serapion received an equity interest in the Firm upon  being\r\n\nnamed a proprietary partner.  Her compensation was predicated  in\r\n\nsubstantial \r                     measure \r                            on \r                               the Firm's profits,6 and she would have been\r\n\n     6Whereas associates in the Firm received fixed  compensation\r\n(plus an  occasional bonus  based on  performance), all  partners\r\n(senior \r                 and \r                     junior) received a base salary supplemented by a share\r\nof the Firm's profits paid out periodically in proportion to each\r\npartner's \r                   allotment \r                            of \r                               PDUs.  For example, when the appellant first\r\nascended to proprietary partnership, her overall compensation was\r\ncomposed of a base salary ($60,183 per annum) plus a share of the\r\n\n                               20\r\r\n\nliable had the Firm sustained losses.  In the ensuing months, she\r\n\nmade substantial  capital contributions to  the Firm.   She  als\r\n\nreceived very generous fringe benefits, e.g., a car allowance  in\r\n\nexcess of $10,000 per annum and a discretionary expense allowance\r\n\nof $16,400  yearly.   These  benefits  were comparable  to  those\r\n\nreceived by the other proprietary partners, but more  extravagant\r\n\nthan the benefits available to junior partners and associates.\r\n\n          The picture  is  only slightly  less  clear as  to  the\r\n\n                                                                e\r                                                                          o\r          management prong  of the  test.   As a  proprietary partner,  th\r\n\nappellant participated  meaningfully  in the  Firm's  governance.\r\n\nUnlike non-proprietary partners (who were allowed to attend Board\r\n\nof Partners' meetings  but could vote  only on matters  affecting\r\n\ntheir own interests), proprietary partners were guaranteed a vote\r\n\nin \r            all \r                matters \r                       brought \r                               before the Board.  The partnership agreement\r\n\ndescribes \r                   this tribunal as \"the highest policy and decision making\r\n\nbody of the Firm.\"   Furthermore, the appellant's vote had  added\r\n\nsignificance:  if an impasse developed between a majority of  the\r\n\nBoard and 4/5ths of the proprietary partners, the decision of the\r\n\nproprietary partners controlled.   While the appellant  belittles\r\n\nBoard  membership,  voting  status   in  a  law  firm's   highest\r\n\ndecisionmaking  body  is no  small  thing.   The  fact  that  the\r\n\nfirm's \r                profits \r                       (amounting to approximately $30,000 during her first\r\nyear \r              as \r                 a \r                   proprietary partner).  Her total compensation was pegged\r\nto \r            75% \r                of \r                   what the four name partners received (resulting in gross\r\nremuneration appreciably  higher  than that  earned by  any  non-\r\nproprietary \r                     partner). \r                               \r                               Her percentage allocation increased steadily\r\nduring the period  that followed, so that,  at the time the  Firm\r\ndissolved \r                   in \r                      1992, \r                           her \r                               total compensation equalled 92% of the total\r\ncompensation paid to each of the name partners.\r\n\n                               21\r\r\n\nmembership  consisted of  roughly half  the lawyers  in the  Firm\r\n\ndilutes, \r                  but \r                      does \r                          not \r                              dispel, the significance of such membership.7\r\n\n          Serapion's involvement in  management went well  beyond\r\n\nmembership in the Board of Partners.   She served as one of  five\r\n\nvoting \r                members \r                        of \r                          the \r                              Executive Committee, which managed the Firm's\r\n\nday-to-day operations and  regularly decided matters relating  to\r\n\nsalaries,  finances,  fee   schedules,  office  space,   employee\r\n\nperformance, \r                      recruitment, admission of new partners, acceptance of\r\n\nbusiness, \r                   work \r                       assignments, and the staffing of cases.  In a period\r\n\nof \r            about \r                  two \r                     years, \r                            the \r                                appellant attended no fewer than sixteen of\r\n\nthese meetings and wrote up the minutes.  A review of  Serapion's\r\n\nhandiwork \r                   shows her to have been a robust participant in important\r\n\npolicy decisions; for example, the minutes reflect that she  made\r\n\nseveral \r                 motions \r                        anent \r                              the admission of new partners.  The Executive\r\n\nCommittee was  the nerve  center of  the Firm.   The  appellant's\r\n\nmembership on  it,  coupled with  her  degree of  involvement  in\r\n\nmanagement generally,  strongly  suggests  that she  was  not  an\r\n\nemployee. \r                    \r                    So, too, does the fact that she had authority to act as\r\n\nan agent for the Firm and its partners; one manifestation of this\r\n\nauthority was that, after  she became a senior partner, the  Firm\r\n\nempowered her to sign checks drawn on its accounts.\r\n\n          The appellant does not go gently into this dark  night.\r\n\nFor \r             the \r                 most \r                     part, \r                           she \r                               strives to refocus our attention on the ways\r\n\n  \r            \r             \r              \r              7\r               We \r                  take judicial notice of the fact that many law firms have\r\npartner/associate ratios near one-to-one, yet few lawyers working\r\nfor these  firms would  deny  that the  partners enjoy  a  status\r\nfundamentally different from that of the associates.\r\n\n                               22\r\r\n\nin \r            which \r                  she \r                     possessed \r                               less power than the four name partners.  She\r\n\ncomplains that her name was never added to the Firm's name;  that\r\n\nneither \r                 her \r                    compensation \r                                 nor her equity interest ever equalled that\r\n\nof \r            the \r                name \r                    partners; \r                              that she had less authority to assign matters\r\n\nwithin the Firm;  and that  she did not  head any  of the  Firm's\r\n\ndepartments. \r                       \r                       But \r                          this \r                               constellation of complaints assumes that all\r\n\npartners except those equivalent in stature and authority to  the\r\n\nmost powerful partners of a law firm are employees for Title  VII\r\n\npurposes.  The assumption lacks any solid legal underpinning.   A\r\n\nperson with  the requisite  attributes of  proprietary status  is\r\n\nproperly considered a proprietor, not an employee, regardless  of\r\n\nthe fact  that others  in the  firm may  wield more  power.

Consequently, the district\r\n\ncourt did not err in granting summary judgment in the defendants'\r\n\n                               24\r\r\n\nfavor on the Title VII claim.9\r\n\nVII.  THE IDENTITY OF THE DEFENDANTS\r\n\n          Before closing,  we  note a  procedural anomaly.    For\r\n\nreasons best known to her, the appellant elected to sue three  of\r\n\nher former partners and their fledgling partnership, but not  the\r\n\nFirm.    This  tactic raises  questions  about  whether  the  new\r\n\npartnership can  be held liable  as a successor  to the Firm  and\r\n\nwhether \r                 law \r                     partners \r                             can \r                                 be held individually liable as \"employers\"\r\n\nunder \r               Title \r                     VII.  The last question, in particular, is potentially\r\n\ndifficult.  Compare Tomka v. Seiler Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705166\"><a href=\"/opinion/705166/carole-tomka-v-the-seiler-corporation-daniel-lucey-david-polonsky-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1295</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1314-17\r\n\n(2d \r             Cir. \r                  1995) (dismissing the possibility of individual liability\r\n\nunder Title VII) with  Kauffman v.

See Scarfo v.\r\n\nCabletron \r                   Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196064\"><a href=\"/opinion/196064/scarfo-v-cabletron-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 951-52 (1st Cir. 1995) (leaving\r\n\nthe question open).\r\n\n          We need  not enter this thicket  today.  It is  crystal\r\n\nclear \r               that \r                    the liability (if any) of the individual defendants and\r\n\nthe new  partnership cannot possibly  exceed that  of the  actual\r\n\nemployer.  Because Serapion was not an employee, her suit  cannot\r\n\nproceed \r                 under \r                       Title \r                            VII \r                                against any of the individual defendants or\r\n\nagainst the new partnership.\r\n\n     9Because this ground is dispositive of the federal claim, we\r\ntake no  view of the  district court's  alternative holding  that\r\nSerapion failed  to make out a  prima facie case of  gender-based\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\n                               25\r\r\n\nVIII.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further.  Once it had determined that the\r\n\nfederal  claim could  not  go  forward, the  district  court  had\r\n\nsubstantial discretion under 28 U.S.C. S 1367(c)(3) (1994) either\r\n\nto \r            retain \r                   or \r                     to \r                        relinquish jurisdiction over the supplemental claim\r\n\nwhich the  appellant had  brought under  local law.   See,  e.g.,\r\n\nMcIntosh\r                  \r                  v. \r                     Antonino\r                            , \r                              </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196445\"><a href=\"/opinion/196445/mcintosh-v-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> \r                                 <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 n.3 (1st Cir. 1995); Rodriguez\r\n\nv. \r            Doral \r                  Mortgage \r                          Corp., \r                                 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196161\"><a href=\"/opinion/196161/rodriguez-bruno-v-doral-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1176-77 (1st Cir. 1995).
