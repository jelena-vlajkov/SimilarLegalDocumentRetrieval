Appellant Ronald  L'Heureux, an inmate\r                                \r\n\nat the Adult Correctional  Institution in Rhode Island, filed\r\n\na  42 U.S.C.   1983 action in Rhode Island's federal district\r\n\ncourt, along with a motion to proceed in forma pauperis.  The\r                                                                   \r\n\ncomplaint,  besides  naming  the   parties  and  citing   the\r\n\njurisdictional bases of the  action, contains only conclusory\r\n\nreferences  to   the  nature  of  appellant's   claims.    It\r\n\nessentially alleges that (1) defendants (various correctional\r\n\nofficials)  manufactured   disciplinary  proceedings  against\r\n\nappellant,  (2)  appellant spent  120  days  in lock-up,  (3)\r\n\nappellant was denied reclassification,  and (4) at least some\r\n\nof these actions were taken for the purpose of discrimination\r\n\nand  retaliation.\r\n\n          The district court denied the request to proceed in\r                                                                         \r\n\nforma  pauperis, stating on the back  of the application that\r                           \r\n\n\"the  allegations are  insufficient  to set  forth a  federal\r\n\ncause of action.\"  The next day, judgment was entered for the\r\n\ndefendants.  Thus, the  only reason given for dismissing  the\r\n\ncomplaint is the above-quoted language.   We construe this as\r\n\na  dismissal under 28 U.S.C.   1915(d).  Appellant then filed\r\n\na motion for relief from judgment and to amend the complaint,\r\n\nand  a motion to reconsider  the denial of  in forma pauperis\r                                                                         \r\n\nstatus.   The amended  complaint added allegations concerning\r\n\nthe events  upon  which  appellant  based the  action.    The\r\n\ndistrict court denied  these motions.  This appeal ensued and\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nappellant  now  requests  permission  to   proceed  in  forma\r                                                                         \r\n\npauperis on appeal.\r                    \r\n\n          Despite its brevity, the complaint should not  have\r\n\nbeen dismissed under   1915(d) without first giving appellant\r\n\nnotice  of the deficiency and  an opportunity to  amend.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nNeitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 329-30 (1989) (emphasizing\r                               \r\n\nthe  importance of  providing  opportunities  for  responsive\r\n\npleadings  to   indigent   litigants  commensurate   to   the\r\n\nopportunities accorded similarly situated  paying litigants);\r\n\nStreet  v. Fair,  918  F.2d 269,  273  (1st Cir.  1990)  (per\r                           \r\n\ncuriam)  (where the complaint's  deficiency conceivably could\r\n\nbe  cured by amendment, an indigent plaintiff must be given a\r\n\nchance  to  supplement  his  or her  allegations  before  any\r\n\ndismissal  on  the merits).    Particularly  in view  of  the\r\n\nallegations  in the  amended  complaint, we  cannot say  that\r\n\nappellant will be unable to state a cognizable claim.\r\n\n          In  the  amended complaint,  appellant specifically\r\n\nalleges  that  prison officials  retaliated  against him  for\r\n\nacting  as a jail-house lawyer.   This court  and others have\r\n\nrecognized such  claims.   See, e.g., McDonald  v. Hall,  610\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d  16, 18 (1st Cir.  1979) (inmate who  asserted that as a\r\n\nresult  of his activities as a jail-house lawyer on behalf of\r\n\nhimself  and others,  he  was transferred  to another  prison\r\n\nstated a claim even  though the allegations were conclusory);\r\n\nGibbs   v.

Dawson,  778 F.2d  527, 531-32\r                                                 \r\n\n(9th Cir. 1985) (the assertion  that an inmate's transfer was\r\n\nin retaliation for his  work as a jail-house lawyer  stated a\r\n\nclaim  for  violation  of   the  First  Amendment  where  the\r\n\nretaliatory  act  did  not  advance  legitimate institutional\r\n\ngoals).  Although the chronology still is vague so that it is\r\n\nnot   clear  whether  appellant's  activities  triggered  the\r\n\ndisciplinary  proceedings,  such  an  omission  goes  to  the\r\n\nfailure to state a claim, not frivolousness.  See Leonardo v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMoran, 611 F.2d 397, 398 (1st Cir. 1979) (plaintiff failed to\r                 \r\n\nstate  a   1983 claim for retaliation based on the conclusory\r\n\nallegation that due to earlier filed grievances in the United\r\n\nStates district court, he was transferred to maximum security\r\n\nand  denied access to  the courts;  plaintiff failed  to show\r\n\nthat  \"but for\"  the  grievances,  he  would  not  have  been\r\n\ntransferred).     Appellant's   allegations   that   he   was\r\n\ntransferred to  segregation for the possession  of legal mail\r\n\nand for  his activities  as a jail-house  lawyer sufficiently\r\n\nimplicate    the   First    Amendment   and    overcome   the\r\n\ncharacterization of the complaint as frivolous.\r\n\n          We therefore grant appellant's motion to proceed in\r                                                                         \r\n\nforma pauperis  on appeal,  summarily vacate the  judgment of\r                          \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nthe district court, and remand for  further proceedings.
