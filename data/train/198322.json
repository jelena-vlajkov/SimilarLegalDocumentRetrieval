Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\nStahl, Circuit Judge,\r\nCampbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nDorothy F. Silver on brief for appellant.\r\nPaul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, and Jean B. Weld, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition.\r\n\nFebruary 5, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful review of the record, appellant's\r\nbrief, the government's motions, and appellant's oppositions\r\nthereto, we conclude that this appeal clearly presents no\r\nsubstantial question and that oral argument would not assist us.\r\nThe district court properly enhanced appellant's sentence\r\nunder U.S.S.G.  3C1.1 for his obstructive conduct in soliciting an\r\nassault on a key witness.  \"Culpability under the Guideline is also\r\napplicable where a defendant causes, or attempts to cause, the\r\nobstruction of justice by a third party.\"  United States v.\r\nVoccola, 99 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir. 1996).  In this case, the\r\nevidence of appellant's criminal intent amply supported the\r\nenhancement, even though his plot was not destined for success and\r\nwas not implemented.  See United States v. Lagasse, 87 F.3d 18, 24\r\n(1st Cir. 1996), citing United States v. Cotts, 14 F.3d 300, 307\r\n(7th Cir. 1994). \r\nThe district court properly denied a credit under U.S.S.G. \r\n3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility, there being no\r\n\"extraordinary\" circumstances to counteract the rejection of\r\nresponsibility demonstrated by appellant's obstructive conduct. \r\nSee Lagasse, 87 F.3d at 25.  The district court did not commit\r\nplain error when it did not explore sua sponte such non-existent\r\ncircumstances.\r\nAppellant's argument that the government breached its plea\r\nagreement is raised for the first time on appeal, and our review of\r\nthe relevant facts and law disclosed no plain error and no grounds\r\nfor resentencing.  \r\n\nThe government's motions for summary disposition and to\r\ndispense with oral argument are granted.\r\nThe judgment is affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
