When plaintiffs sued, the district  court\n\nadded to their pain,  granting the employer's motion  for summary\n\njudgment.  We can offer little comfort.\n\n                                I\n                                 \n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          Consistent  with the method of  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56, we\n\ndraw  upon the  undisputed  facts  to  set  the  stage  for  what\n\ntranspired.\n\n          Defendant-appellee   Kodak   Caribbean,  Ltd.   (Kodak)\n\ndecided  to downsize its operations in Puerto Rico.  To this end,\n\nit announced  the availability of a  voluntary separation program\n\n(the  VSP).1   On  September 15,  1989, Kodak  held a  meeting to\n\nexplain the VSP to its local work force.  The company distributed\n\ndescriptive documents to virtually all Kodak employees, save only\n\nfor  certain managerial and human resources personnel, regardless\n\nof age or  years of service.   The written materials  spelled out\n\nthe benefits  afforded, the method of  calculating severance pay,\n\nand how the program would be implemented.\n\n                    \n\n     1The record reflects that  Kodak's parent company decided to\nslash costs by reorganizing  its operations throughout the United\nStates  and, consequently,  promulgated the  VSP on  a nationwide\nbasis.  The Puerto Rico reduction in force was part and parcel of\nthis larger reorganization.\n\n                                2\n\n          Kodak encouraged workers to participate in the VSP, but\n\ndid not  require them to do so.  Withal, the company informed all\n\nits  employees  that  if  substantially   fewer  than  twenty-six\n\nindividuals opted to enter the VSP, others would be reassigned or\n\nfurloughed in order to reach the desired staffing level.\n\n          Two veteran  employees, Jorge  Vega  and Eusebio  Leon,\n\nwere among  those who  chose to  participate in the  VSP.   After\n\nsigning  an election  form on  October 4,  1989, Leon  received a\n\nlump-sum  severance payment  of $28,163.16  plus other  benefits.\n\nVega  followed suit on October 10, 1989, executing a similar form\n\nand receiving a $52,671.00 severance payment.  The men retired on\n\nthe dates designated in  their respective election forms.   At no\n\ntime did either man ask to revoke his election or offer to refund\n\nhis severance payment.\n\n          In 1990,  Vega and Leon brought  separate suits against\n\nKodak, each alleging discrimination  on the basis of age.   Their\n\ncomplaints, which invoked  the Age  Discrimination in  Employment\n\nAct  (ADEA), 29  U.S.C.    621-634  (1988 &amp; Supp.  III 1991), and\n\ncertain Puerto Rico statutes, charged that Kodak's implementation\n\nof the VSP violated the law.  The district court consolidated the\n\ntwo cases and, on  December 10, 1992, granted Kodak's  motion for\n\nbrevis disposition.2  This appeal ensued.\n      \n\n                    \n\n     2Appellants'  suits triggered  the district  court's federal\nquestion  jurisdiction.  See 28  U.S.C.   1331  (1988).  However,\n                            \nwhen  the district court disposed of the ADEA claims, the pendent\nclaims became subject  to dismissal  for want  of subject  matter\njurisdiction.   See United Mine  Workers v. Gibbs,  383 U.S. 715,\n                                                 \n726  (1966) (\"[I]f the federal claims are dismissed before trial,\n. . . the state claims should be dismissed as well.\"); Gilbert v.\n                                                              \n\n                                3\n\n                                II\n                                  \n\n                       The Legal Framework\n                                          \n\n          In  a  wrongful  discharge  case under  the  ADEA,  the\n\nplaintiff bears  the ultimate \"burden  of proving that  . . .  he\n\nwould not have been fired  but for his age.\"  Freeman  v. Package\n                                                                 \n\nMach. Co.,  865 F.2d 1331,  1335 (1st Cir. 1988).   Absent direct\n         \n\nevidence of purposeful age discrimination    and no such evidence\n\nembellishes the  record before us    the familiar burden-shifting\n\nframework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-\n                                             \n\n05 (1973), initially requires that a plaintiff establish a  prima\n\nfacie  case by demonstrating that he was (i) within the protected\n\nage  group, (ii)  meeting  the employer's  legitimate performance\n\nexpectations,  (iii) actually  or constructively  discharged, and\n\n(iv)  replaced  by  another  individual  of  similar  skills  and\n\nqualifications, thereby confirming  the employer's continued need\n\nfor equivalent services.   See Mesnick v. General Elec.  Co., 950\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 816,  823 (1st Cir.  1991), cert.  denied, 112  S. Ct.  2965\n                                              \n\n(1992).  When a reduction  in force is involved, a  plaintiff may\n\nsatisfy the fourth element by demonstrating that the employer did\n\nnot treat  age neutrally in shrinking its  payroll.  This lack of\n\nneutrality may be manifested  either by a facially discriminatory\n\npolicy or by a policy which, though  age-neutral on its face, has\n\nthe  effect  of discriminating  against  older  persons, say,  by\n\n                    \n\nCity of Cambridge,  932 F.2d  51, 67 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (similar),\n                 \ncert. denied,  112 S.Ct. 192  (1992); Brennan  v. Hendrigan,  888\n                                                           \nF.2d  189,  196  (1st Cir.  1989)  (similar).    Hence, we  focus\nexclusively on appellants' ADEA claims.\n\n                                4\n\nleading inexorably  to the  retention of younger  employees while\n\nsimilarly  situated  older  employees  are  given  their  walking\n\npapers.  See Hebert v. Mohawk Rubber Co.,  872 F.2d 1104, 1110-11\n                                        \n\n(1st  Cir. 1989); Holt v. Gamewell Corp., 797 F.2d 36, 37-38 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1986).\n\n          Establishing a prima  facie case creates  a presumption\n\nthat the employer unlawfully  discriminated and shifts the burden\n\nof production to the defendant.  See Hebert, 872 F.2d at 1110-11.\n                                           \n\nAt  this second stage, the  employer must rebut  the inference of\n\nage    discrimination    by    articulating   some    legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for the employment action.  See Mesnick,\n                                                                \n\n950  F.2d at  823; Hebert,  872 F.2d  at 1111.   If  the employer\n                         \n\nadvances the required showing, the inference originally generated\n\nby the  prima facie case  drops from  sight.  In  that event,  it\n\nfalls upon  the plaintiff  (who bears  the  burden of  persuasion\n\nthroughout) to show that  the employer's alleged justification is\n\na mere pretext for age discrimination.  See Mesnick,  950 F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n823.   To  prevail  at  this  third  stage,  the  plaintiff  must\n\nordinarily do  more than impugn the legitimacy  of the employer's\n\nasserted  justification; he  must  also adduce  evidence \"of  the\n\nemployer's discriminatory  animus.\"  Id.  at 825; see  also Hazen\n                                                                 \n\nPaper Co. v. Biggins, 113 S. Ct. 1701, 1706, 1708 (1993) (stating\n                    \n\nthat liability under the ADEA depends upon  whether age \"actually\n\nmotivated the  employer's decision\" and hesitating  to infer age-\n\nbased animus  solely \"from  the implausibility of  the employer's\n\nexplanation\");  cf. St. Mary's  Honor Ctr. v.  Hicks, 61 U.S.L.W.\n                                                    \n\n                                5\n\n4782, 4785 (U.S. June 25, 1993) (holding that success in a  race-\n\ndiscrimination  suit  requires  a \"finding  that  the  employer's\n\naction was the product of unlawful discrimination\" and not merely\n\n\"the much different (and much lesser) finding that the employer's\n\nexplanation of its action was not believable\").\n\n          The intersection at which the burden-shifting framework\n\nmeets Rule  56 is also well mapped.  To survive summary judgment,\n\n\"a  plaintiff must establish at least a genuine issue of material\n\nfact on every element essential to his case in chief.\"   Mesnick,\n                                                                \n\n950 F.2d at 825; see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n                                                  \n\n323  (1986);  Hebert,  872 F.2d  at  1106.    In  other words,  a\n                    \n\nplaintiff  must  adduce  some  minimally  sufficient  evidence to\n\nsupport a  jury finding that he  has met his burden  at the first\n\nstage, and again at the third stage (so long as the defendant has\n\nmet its  second-stage burden by articulating  a nondiscriminatory\n\nreason  for  the  adverse  employment  action).    Moreover,  the\n\nmaterial creating  the factual dispute must  herald the existence\n\nof  \"definite,  competent  evidence\" fortifying  the  plaintiff's\n\nversion of the truth.  Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 822; see also Mack v.\n                                                              \n\nGreat  Atl. &amp; Pac.

We explain briefly.\n\n          To satisfy the  third element in the  prima facie case,\n\nADEA  suitors who claim to have been wrongfully ousted from their\n\njobs must  demonstrate that they were  actually or constructively\n\ndischarged.    Here,  appellants   concede  that  they  were  not\n\ncashiered.   They maintain, however, that  Kodak's sponsorship of\n\nthe VSP  effected their  constructive discharges by  forcing them\n\ninto  an  unpalatable  (and  unwarranted)  choice  between  early\n\nretirement and dismissal.3   The facts of record, fused  with the\n\nappropriate legal standard, belie the charge.\n\n          Mere  offers  for  early  retirement,  even those  that\n\ninclude attractive  incentives designed to  induce employees  who\n\nmight otherwise stay on  the job to separate from  the employer's\n\nservice,  do not  transgress  the ADEA.    See Henn  v.  National\n                                                                 \n\nGeographic Soc'y, 819 F.2d 824, 828 (7th Cir.)

Polaroid  Corp.,  848 F.2d  276,  278  (1st Cir.  1988).    To\n                  \n\ntransform  an  offer  of  early retirement  into  a  constructive\n\ndischarge,  a plaintiff must show that the offer was nothing more\n\nthan a charade, that  is, a subterfuge disguising the  employer's\n\ndesire to purge plaintiff from the ranks because of his age.  See\n                                                                 \n\nHebert, 872 F.2d  at 1111.   Under this  dichotomy, offers  which\n      \n\nfurnish  employees  a  choice  in  name  only  are  impermissible\n\nbecause,  in the  final  analysis, they  effectively vitiate  the\n\nemployees' power to choose work over retirement.  Phrased another\n\nway,  the law regards as the functional equivalent of a discharge\n\nthose  offers of early retirement  which, if refused, will result\n\nin work  so  arduous or  unappealing,  or working  conditions  so\n\nintolerable,  that a  reasonable person  would feel  compelled to\n\nforsake his job  rather than  to submit  to looming  indignities.\n\nSee Calhoun v.

In terms  of this  standard, a  plaintiff who  has\n\naccepted an  employer's offer to retire can  be said to have been\n\nconstructively discharged  when the offer presented  was, at rock\n\nbottom,  \"a  choice between  early  retirement  with benefits  or\n\ndischarge  without   benefits,\"  or,   more  starkly   still,  an\n\n\"impermissible take-it-or-leave-it choice  between retirement  or\n\ndischarge.\"  Hebert, 872 F.2d at 1113.\n                   \n\n          Kodak's  promulgation of the VSP cannot be said to have\n\n                                8\n\npresented Vega and  Leon with this sort of  Hobson's choice.  The\n\noffer was cast as one to be accepted or rejected at an employee's\n\nwill.  The contract and explanatory memorandum contained numerous\n\nwords and phrases  alerting the reader  to its voluntary  nature.\n\nMoreover,  the  circumstances of  the  offer  were not  coercive:\n\nemployees had  six weeks to mull the offer's ramifications before\n\nmaking a decision; they were encouraged to gather information and\n\nask questions; and they retained the right to revoke the election\n\nfor  a  period of  time.   An  employer's  effort to  construct a\n\npressure-free environment conducive to calm decisionmaking in the\n\nemployee's  enlightened  self-interest   often  constitutes   the\n\nhallmark of a  real offer as opposed to an  ultimatum.  See Henn,\n                                                                \n\n819 F.2d at  828-29 (considering similar factors in analyzing the\n\nvoluntariness of an early retirement plan).  So it is here.\n\n          Finally, nothing in the  record indicates that, for any\n\nparticular  employee,  refusing  early  retirement  meant  either\n\ndischarge or the imposition of working conditions so abhorrent as\n\nto  justify resignation.   To be  sure, Kodak said  that it would\n\nlikely  furlough  a number  of  employees if  not  enough workers\n\nelected to  depart voluntarily.   But, three things  palliate the\n\ninference  that appellants seek to draw from this statement:  (1)\n\nthe company simultaneously announced, both orally and in writing,\n\nthat if a sufficient complement participated in the VSP, the need\n\nto thin the ranks  unilaterally would never arise; (2) it did not\n\ndirectly  or indirectly  indicate  which  particular  individuals\n\nwould  be tapped should layoffs prove to be necessary; and (3) it\n\n                                9\n\nnever threatened that persons ultimately selected for involuntary\n\nseparation would be treated harshly.4\n\n          Notwithstanding the formidable  array of  circumstances\n\nweighing  in   favor  of  a  finding   that  appellants  resigned\n\nvoluntarily,  appellants  assert  that  they  were constructively\n\ndischarged  because  they believed  that  rejecting  the VSP  was\n                                  \n\ntantamount to forfeiting their jobs.  We discern no genuine issue\n\nof  material  fact;  assuming  that appellants'  mindset  was  as\n\nstated,  their  conclusion  does   not  follow.    An  employee's\n\nperceptions cannot  govern a claim of  constructive discharge if,\n\nand  to the extent that,  the perceptions are  unreasonable.  See\n                                                                 \n\nCalhoun, 798 F.2d at 561.  Were the rule otherwise, any  employee\n       \n\nwho quit,  and  thereafter  thought better  of  it,  could  claim\n\nconstructive  discharge  with  impunity.    The  law,  therefore,\n\ndemands that  a disgruntled ex-employee's professed  belief about\n\nthe likely consequences of refusing an offer for early retirement\n\nbe judged by an \"objective standard,\" the focus of  which is \"the\n\nreasonable state  of mind  of the  putative discriminatee.\"   Id.\n                                                                 \n\n(citations and internal  quotation marks omitted).   In light  of\n\nthe uncontroverted facts  of record here,  appellants' impression\n\nthat the  ignominy of firing  comprised the  only alternative  to\n\naccepting the VSP was thoroughly unreasonable.\n\n                    \n\n     4For   example,  Kodak   never  warned   that  involuntarily\nseparated employees  would be  stripped of severance  benefits or\ntreated  less favorably than those persons who chose to enter the\nVSP.  And, moreover, the company suggested that attempts would be\nmade  to  offer   involuntarily  separated  employees  comparable\npositions  elsewhere in  the  Kodak organization,  as opposed  to\nsimply cutting them loose.\n\n                                10\n\n          In an  attempt to coat their subjective  beliefs with a\n\npatina  of  plausibility,  appellants  ignore the  fact  that  no\n\nfirings  or  layoffs  ever  materialized, and,  instead,  tout  a\n\nsupervisor's statement  that  Kodak shelters  \"no  sacred  cows.\"\n\nThis statement, directed not toward  Vega and Leon in  particular\n\nbut toward Kodak's entire  work force, articulated an unfortunate\n\nbut  hardly remarkable  condition of  working life:   broad-based\n\nsubjugation to the risk of future termination is common fare in a\n\ndepressed  economic  climate.    It, alone,  is  insufficient  to\n\nconstitute constructive  discharge.  See Bodnar  v. Synpol, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n843 F.2d 190, 193-94 (5th Cir.)

Rather, Kodak  asked its employees to\n      \n\nchoose between immediate  severance with its associated  benefits\n\nor continued work with its inherent risks.  As the alternative to\n\nseparation from the employer's  service was not so onerous  as to\n\n                                11\n\ncompel  a  reasonable  person's  resignation,  appellants  cannot\n\nconvincingly claim to have been constructively discharged.\n\n                                IV\n                                  \n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          We need go no further.  Although Kodak has assembled an\n\narmada  of additional  asseverations in  support of  the decision\n\nbelow, addressing those points would serve no useful purpose.  It\n\nsuffices to say  that, since  appellants failed to  limn a  prima\n\nfacie  case   of   age  discrimination,5   the   district   court\n\nappropriately entered summary judgment in the defendant's favor.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     5Because appellants  had the burden of  adducing evidence on\neach  of the  four  elements  of  their  prima  facie  case,  the\ndeficiency  we have  described is  fatal to  their suits.   Thus,\nalthough we note in passing that their prima facie case flounders\nin  another respect as  well   the record  does not support their\nassertions that  Kodak  failed  to  treat age  neutrally  in  its\nauthorship and  implementation of the  VSP   we  do not pause  to\nelucidate the point. \n\n                                12\n",

R. Civ.  P. 56, we\n\ndraw  upon the  undisputed  facts  to  set  the  stage  for  what\n\ntranspired.\n\n          Defendant-appellee   Kodak   Caribbean,  Ltd.   (Kodak)\n\ndecided  to downsize its operations in Puerto Rico.  To this end,\n\nit announced  the availability of a  voluntary separation program\n\n(the  VSP).1   On  September 15,  1989, Kodak  held a  meeting to\n\nexplain the VSP to its local work force.  The company distributed\n\ndescriptive documents to virtually all Kodak employees, save only\n\nfor  certain managerial and human resources personnel, regardless\n\nof age or  years of service.   The written materials  spelled out\n\nthe benefits  afforded, the method of  calculating severance pay,\n\nand how the program would be implemented.\n\n                    \n\n     1The record reflects that  Kodak's parent company decided to\nslash costs by reorganizing  its operations throughout the United\nStates  and, consequently,  promulgated the  VSP on  a nationwide\nbasis.  The Puerto Rico reduction in force was part and parcel of\nthis larger reorganization.\n\n                                2\n\n          Kodak encouraged workers to participate in the VSP, but\n\ndid not  require them to do so.  Withal, the company informed all\n\nits  employees  that  if  substantially   fewer  than  twenty-six\n\nindividuals opted to enter the VSP, others would be reassigned or\n\nfurloughed in order to reach the desired staffing level.\n\n          Two veteran  employees, Jorge  Vega  and Eusebio  Leon,\n\nwere among  those who  chose to  participate in the  VSP.   After\n\nsigning  an election  form on  October 4,  1989, Leon  received a\n\nlump-sum  severance payment  of $28,163.16  plus other  benefits.\n\nVega  followed suit on October 10, 1989, executing a similar form\n\nand receiving a $52,671.00 severance payment.  The men retired on\n\nthe dates designated in  their respective election forms.   At no\n\ntime did either man ask to revoke his election or offer to refund\n\nhis severance payment.\n\n          In 1990,  Vega and Leon brought  separate suits against\n\nKodak, each alleging discrimination  on the basis of age.   Their\n\ncomplaints, which invoked  the Age  Discrimination in  Employment\n\nAct  (ADEA), 29  U.S.C.    621-634  (1988 &amp; Supp.  III 1991), and\n\ncertain Puerto Rico statutes, charged that Kodak's implementation\n\nof the VSP violated the law.  The district court consolidated the\n\ntwo cases and, on  December 10, 1992, granted Kodak's  motion for\n\nbrevis disposition.2  This appeal ensued.\n      \n\n                    \n\n     2Appellants'  suits triggered  the district  court's federal\nquestion  jurisdiction.  See 28  U.S.C.   1331  (1988).  However,\n                            \nwhen  the district court disposed of the ADEA claims, the pendent\nclaims became subject  to dismissal  for want  of subject  matter\njurisdiction.

To be  sure, Kodak said  that it would\n\nlikely  furlough  a number  of  employees if  not  enough workers\n\nelected to  depart voluntarily.   But, three things  palliate the\n\ninference  that appellants seek to draw from this statement:  (1)\n\nthe company simultaneously announced, both orally and in writing,\n\nthat if a sufficient complement participated in the VSP, the need\n\nto thin the ranks  unilaterally would never arise; (2) it did not\n\ndirectly  or indirectly  indicate  which  particular  individuals\n\nwould  be tapped should layoffs prove to be necessary; and (3) it\n\n                                9\n\nnever threatened that persons ultimately selected for involuntary\n\nseparation would be treated harshly.4\n\n          Notwithstanding the formidable  array of  circumstances\n\nweighing  in   favor  of  a  finding   that  appellants  resigned\n\nvoluntarily,  appellants  assert  that  they  were constructively\n\ndischarged  because  they believed  that  rejecting  the VSP  was\n                                  \n\ntantamount to forfeiting their jobs.  We discern no genuine issue\n\nof  material  fact;  assuming  that appellants'  mindset  was  as\n\nstated,  their  conclusion  does   not  follow.    An  employee's\n\nperceptions cannot  govern a claim of  constructive discharge if,\n\nand  to the extent that,  the perceptions are  unreasonable.

In light  of\n\nthe uncontroverted facts  of record here,  appellants' impression\n\nthat the  ignominy of firing  comprised the  only alternative  to\n\naccepting the VSP was thoroughly unreasonable.\n\n                    \n\n     4For   example,  Kodak   never  warned   that  involuntarily\nseparated employees  would be  stripped of severance  benefits or\ntreated  less favorably than those persons who chose to enter the\nVSP.
