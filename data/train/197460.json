Appellant  Ramos-Beauchamp  (\"Ramos\")\r\n\nbrought this  suit against  various officials  of her  former\r\n\nemployer, \r                     the \r                        Department \r                                   of the Interior, National Park Service\r\n\n(collectively \"DOI\"), alleging discrimination on the basis of\r\n\nher \r               gender \r                      and ethnicity (Hispanic).  Ramos claimed that while\r\n\nshe was  employed as a  park ranger, she  was subjected to  a\r\n\ndiscriminator\r                        ily hostile work environment, disparate treatment\r\n\nin \r              the \r                  assignment of equipment, training, responsibilities and\r\n\ndiscipline; and a retaliatory constructive discharge.   Ramos\r\n\ninitially \r                     submitted \r                              her \r                                  complaints to the DOI's office of equal\r\n\nopportunity \r                       (\"OEO\").  The OEO found no support for most of the\r\n\ncharges, but did find disparate treatment in (1) a thirty-day\r\n\ndisciplinary \r                        suspension of Ramos's law enforcement commission,\r\n\nand \r               (2) \r                   the \r                       provision of certain equipment.  The DOI undertook\r\n\nremedial action; Ramos proceeded to district court. \r\n\n          Following a five-day bench trial, which was held by\r\n\nconsent \r                   of \r                      the parties before a magistrate judge, judgment was\r\n\nentered for the defendant on all claims.  The court's factual\r\n\nfindings and  legal conclusions are  set forth  in a  26-page\r\n\nopinion.\r\n\n          Ramos \r                           timely \r                                  appealed, but failed to provide a trial\r\n\ntranscript.  Unable  thus to review the issues, including  an\r\n\nevidentiary question which initially appeared substantial, we\r\n\ndirected Ramos to provide  the transcript or face  dismissal.\r\n\nCiting  a  change   in  her   financial  circumstances,   she\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nsuccessfully  sought  an  extension  of  time,  and  obtained\r\n\npermission \r                      from \r                          the \r                              district court to proceed in forma pauperis\r\n\nwith \r                production \r                           of \r                             the \r                                 transcript at government expense.  After\r\n\nfurther delays, the transcript was transmitted to this court.\r\n\n          Ramos assigns as  error the court's exclusion  from\r\n\nevidence of an  \"administrative deposition\" given by  another\r\n\nHispanic female  park  ranger, Mirta  Maltes.   The  excluded\r\n\n\"deposition,\" or sworn statement,  was taken in a  one-on-one\r\n\nquestion \r                    and \r                       answer \r                              session conducted by the DOI's internal OEO\r\n\ninvestigator.  \r\n\n          Exclusion of  this  evidence, Ramos  contends,  was\r\n\ncontrary to the parties' \"binding\" joint pretrial memorandum,\r\n\nas incorporated into the court's final case management order.\r\n\nThe final order twice referenced Maltes's statement.   Maltes\r\n\nwas listed, first,  as a witness for Ramos \"by  deposition.\" \r\n\nMaltes's \"sworn statement\"  also was listed as a DOI  exhibit\r\n\nwhich, by the terms of the order, was \"received in evidence.\"\r\n\n          Nonetheless, at trial  the DOI objected when  Ramos\r\n\nproffered \r                     the \r                        Maltes \r                               statement during her case in chief.  After\r\n\nsome  wrangling, the  statement  was excluded  from  evidence\r\n\nbecause, the magistrate held, it was hearsay and inadmissible\r\n\nunder any exception to the hearsay rule, including the  open-\r\n\nended exception in Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(5).\r\n\n          We need  not definitively  resolve the  evidentiary\r\n\nquestion, however, since a close reading of the record  shows\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthat  regardless  of  whether  the  statement  was   properly\r\n\nadmissible \r                      or \r                        inadmissible, its exclusion did not prejudicially\r\n\naffect Ramos's  \"substantial rights,\" or  the outcome of  the\r\n\ntrial.  Lubanski v. Coleco Industries, Inc., 929 F.2d 42,  45\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991); see  also United States v. Legarda, 17  F.3d\r\n\n496, 498 (1st  Cir.) (holding that an erroneous exclusion  of\r\n\nevidence requires reversal only if it has a \"substantial  and\r\n\ninjurious effect or influence\" on the verdict), cert. denied,\r\n\n513 U.S. 820 (1994).  \r\n\n          The primary value of Maltes's statement was that it\r\n\ncorroborated  Ramos's  allegations  of  disparities  in   the\r\n\nassignment of equipment, training, and responsibilities.  The\r\n\nvery same facts, however, were placed in evidence by  Ramos's\r\n\ntestimony. \r                       \r                       Moreover, the disparities were not challenged, but\r\n\nwere conceded by  the DOI's witnesses.   The DOI's  witnesses\r\n\nexplained the uneven assignments as due to non-discriminatory\r\n\nfactors.  Their explanations were accepted as credible by the\r\n\nmagistrate. \r                        \r                        Thus, \r                             the \r                                 outcome of the trial on these claims was\r\n\nnot  affected  by   the  exclusion  of  Maltes's   statement,\r\n\nencompassing as it did little more than conceded facts. \r\n\n          As to  Ramos's  other  claims,  Maltes's  statement\r\n\ncontained no substantial supporting proof.  Maltes swore that\r\n\nshe had no  personal knowledge of  the facts surrounding  the\r\n\ndisciplinary \r                        suspension of Ramos's law enforcement commission.\r\n\nThe statement offered only one marginal fact in corroboration\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof Ramos's  retaliation  claim (that  Ramos had  presented  a\r\n\ndoctor's \r                    note \r                         to \r                           excuse \r                                  an absence).1  And Maltes flatly denied\r\n\nknowledge  of  any disparities  in  overtime  pay  and  shift\r\n\nassignments.  Finally, while Maltes's statement  conclusorily\r\n\ncharacterized\r                         the atmosphere at work as \"male chauvinist,\" she\r\n\nalso denied suffering any employment disadvantage due to  her\r\n\ngender, \r                   thus \r                        providing no factual support for Ramos's claim of\r\n\na     discriminatorily     hostile     work     environment. \r\n\n          Ramos's \r                             other assignments of error, as we understand\r\n\nthem,2 fare no better.  We apprehend no error in the standard\r\n\nused by  the court  to assess the  claim of \"abusive  working\r\n\nenvironment;\" perceive no  prejudice in  the court's  alleged\r\n\nmisstatement \r                        of \r                          Maltes's \r                                   employment title; find no abuse in the\r\n\ncourt's \r                   evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses; and no\r\n\nbasis for  the argument that the  court denied a \"release  of\r\n\npertinent information in  agency files.\"  To the extent  that\r\n\nRamos \r                 means \r                       to \r                         challenge \r                                   the weight of the evidence, we observe\r\n\n   1The statement recites Maltes's \"belief\" that Ramos had\r\nencountered retaliation, but there is no recitation of a\r\nfactual basis for the \"belief.\"  And, although Maltes stated\r\nthat she, too, feared retaliation, the only reason suggested\r\nfor her fear is that on one occasion she felt threatened by a\r\nsupervisor's \"personal\" animosity toward her. \r\n\n   2Although the transcript has been available for several\r\nmonths, Ramos has not moved to supplement her brief with\r\nrecord references.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nthat this  was not  a \"close\" case.   There  is ample  record\r\n\nevidence to support the court's factual findings.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\n",

The\r\n\nvery same facts, however, were placed in evidence by  Ramos's\r\n\ntestimony. \r                       \r                       Moreover, the disparities were not challenged, but\r\n\nwere conceded by  the DOI's witnesses.   The DOI's  witnesses\r\n\nexplained the uneven assignments as due to non-discriminatory\r\n\nfactors.  Their explanations were accepted as credible by the\r\n\nmagistrate. \r                        \r                        Thus, \r                             the \r                                 outcome of the trial on these claims was\r\n\nnot  affected  by   the  exclusion  of  Maltes's   statement,\r\n\nencompassing as it did little more than conceded facts. \r\n\n          As to  Ramos's  other  claims,  Maltes's  statement\r\n\ncontained no substantial supporting proof.  Maltes swore that\r\n\nshe had no  personal knowledge of  the facts surrounding  the\r\n\ndisciplinary \r                        suspension of Ramos's law enforcement commission.\r\n\nThe statement offered only one marginal fact in corroboration\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof Ramos's  retaliation  claim (that  Ramos had  presented  a\r\n\ndoctor's \r                    note \r                         to \r                           excuse \r                                  an absence).1  And Maltes flatly denied\r\n\nknowledge  of  any disparities  in  overtime  pay  and  shift\r\n\nassignments.  Finally, while Maltes's statement  conclusorily\r\n\ncharacterized\r                         the atmosphere at work as \"male chauvinist,\" she\r\n\nalso denied suffering any employment disadvantage due to  her\r\n\ngender, \r                   thus \r                        providing no factual support for Ramos's claim of\r\n\na     discriminatorily     hostile     work     environment. \r\n\n          Ramos's \r                             other assignments of error, as we understand\r\n\nthem,2 fare no better.  We apprehend no error in the standard\r\n\nused by  the court  to assess the  claim of \"abusive  working\r\n\nenvironment;\" perceive no  prejudice in  the court's  alleged\r\n\nmisstatement \r                        of \r                          Maltes's \r                                   employment title; find no abuse in the\r\n\ncourt's \r                   evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses; and no\r\n\nbasis for  the argument that the  court denied a \"release  of\r\n\npertinent information in  agency files.\"  To the extent  that\r\n\nRamos \r                 means \r                       to \r                         challenge \r                                   the weight of the evidence, we observe\r\n\n   1The statement recites Maltes's \"belief\" that Ramos had\r\nencountered retaliation, but there is no recitation of a\r\nfactual basis for the \"belief.\"  And, although Maltes stated\r\nthat she, too, feared retaliation, the only reason suggested\r\nfor her fear is that on one occasion she felt threatened by a\r\nsupervisor's \"personal\" animosity toward her. \r\n\n   2Although the transcript has been available for several\r\nmonths, Ramos has not moved to supplement her brief with\r\nrecord references.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nthat this  was not  a \"close\" case.   There  is ample  record\r\n\nevidence to support the court's factual findings.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\n</pre>",
