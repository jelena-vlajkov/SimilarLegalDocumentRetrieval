The regulation,  called the  \"automobile\n\nresource exemption,\" limits to $1,500 the equity value of the\n\nautomobile a  family may  own before the  automobile's equity\n\nvalue  affects  the family's  qualification  to  receive AFDC\n\nbenefits.   45  C.F.R.    233.20(a)(3)(i)(B)(2) (1993).   The\n\ndistrict court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment\n\nand granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, striking\n\ndown the regulation as arbitrary and capricious.  We reverse.\n\n                              I.\n\n          AFDC is  a joint federal-state program  designed to\n\nprovide financial assistance to needy, dependent children and\n\ntheir families.  42 U.S.C.   601 (1988).  Although states, as\n\nthe primary  administrators of  the program, are  given broad\n\ndiscretion   to  define   benefit   levels  and   eligibility\n\nrequirements, state programs must  conform with federal  laws\n\nand regulations  in order to receive  matching federal funds.\n\nId.    Federal HHS  regulations  set  maximum limits  on  the\r               \n\nresources  a family may own and still qualify to receive AFDC\n\nbenefits.    Under the  regulations  in  effect before  1975,\n\nfamilies with more than $2,000 in real and  personal property\n\ndid not qualify for AFDC benefits.  45 C.F.R.   233.20 (a)(3)\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n(1974).      These  early   regulations  exempted   from  the\n\ncalculation of family resources  the value of certain assets,\n\nincluding, without  limitation, the value  of one automobile.\n\nId.\r               \n\n          In 1975, the Secretary of the Department of Health,\n\nEducation and  Welfare (the  predecessor to HHS)  amended the\n\nregulations and, for the first time, attempted to place a cap\n\non  the automobile exemption.  The new regulation set the cap\n\nat  $1,200  retail market  value     any  market value  in an\n\nautomobile exceeding the $1,200  limit would now count toward\n\nthe overall resource limit.  40 Fed. Reg. 12,507 (1975).  The\n\nD.C.   Circuit,  however,   subsequently   struck  down   the\n\nregulation in  National Welfare  Rights Org. v.  Mathews, 553\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  637, 643  (D.C.  Cir. 1976).1    Thus after  1976,  the\n\nautomobile  exemption was  once again  governed by  the prior\n\nversion of  the  regulation, which  completely  exempted  the\n\nvalue  of  one  automobile  from the  calculation  of  family\n\nresources. See 41 Fed. Reg. 30,647 (1976).\r                          \n\n          In   1981,  Congress  enacted  the  Omnibus  Budget\n\nReconciliation Act  of 1981 (\"OBRA\"), which  amended the AFDC\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.   Although  the court  found  that  the governing  statute\nauthorized   the  Secretary   to  set  resource   limits  for\nparticipation  in  the  AFDC  program,  the  court  held  the\nregulation  invalid because:   (1)  the  Secretary improperly\nbased the limit on  \"market\" rather than \"equity\"  value; and\n(2) the  Secretary failed to articulate  a sufficient factual\nbasis for the  $1,200 figure.  National Welfare  Rights Org.,\r                                                                        \n533 F.2d at 648-49.\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nprogram  by statutorily  reducing from  $2,000 to  $1,000 the\n\nmaximum resource  limit for  AFDC recipients.2   Pub. L.  No.\n\n97-35, 95  Stat. 357,  843 (1981);  42 U.S.C.    602(a)(7)(B)\n\n(Supp. V 1993).   The purpose  of this amendment  was to  cut\n\ncosts and to limit AFDC benefits to only the most needy.  See\r                                                                         \n\nChampion v. Shalala,  33 F.2d 963, 967  (8th Cir. 1994).   At\r                               \n\nthe  same  time,  Congress  allowed states  to  exclude  from\n\ncalculation  of the overall  resource limit  \"so much  of the\n\nfamily member's ownership interest  in one automobile as does\r                                                                         \n\nnot exceed such amount  as the Secretary may prescribe.\"   42\r                                                                  \n\nU.S.C.    602(a)(7)(B)(i) (Supp.  V  1993) (emphasis  added).\n\nPursuant to  this delegation  of authority, the  Secretary of\n\nHHS in  1982 promulgated a regulation  setting the automobile\n\nresource    exemption   at    $1,500.        45   C.F.R.     \n\n233.20(a)(3)(i)(B)(2)  (1993).3    Any  equity value4  in  an\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.   States were  still permitted,  however, to set  resource\nlimits at a lower level.   42 U.S.C.   602(a)(7)(B)  (Supp. V\n1993).\n\n3.   The full text of the challenged regulation reads:\n\n          The  amount of real and personal property\n          that can be  reserved for each assistance\n          unit  shall  not  be  in  excess  of  one\n          thousand  dollars  equity value  (or such\n          lesser amount  as the State  specifies in\n          its State plan) excluding only: . . .\n\n          (2)  One  automobile,  up  to  $1,500  of\n          equity value or such  lower limit as  the\n          State may specify in the State plan; (any\n          excess  equity  value  must   be  applied\n          towards   the   general  resource   limit\n          specified in the State plan.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nautomobile  that exceeded  this amount  would now  be counted\n\ntoward the $1,000 overall resource limit, which, if exceeded,\n\nleaves a family ineligible for AFDC.\n\n          The   automobile   resource  exemption   has  since\n\nremained at  $1,500, although it has  received some attention\n\nfrom both Congress and the Secretary.   In 1988, the House of\n\nRepresentatives passed, as  part of the Family Support Act of\n\n1988, Pub. L.  No. 100-485,  102 Stat. 2343,  2356 (1988),  a\n\nbill  containing a  provision  that would  have allowed  some\n\nstates  to  experiment  with  a  $4,500  automobile  resource\n\nexemption.   The Senate version  of the bill  did not contain\n\nsuch  a  provision.   The  conference  committee adopted  the\n\nSenate  version, but  directed  the Secretary  to review  the\n\nautomobile  resource regulations  \"and to  revise them  if he\n\ndetermines revision  would be appropriate.\"   H.R. Conf. Rep.\n\nNo.  998, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 189 (1988), reprinted in 1988\r                                                                    \n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2879, 2976-77.  After reviewing the  regulation,\n\nthe Secretary in 1991 declined to revise the figure.  55 Fed.\n\nReg. 44,524 (1990); 56  Fed. Reg. 17,358 (1991).   In a  1992\n\nletter to  Senator Dennis DeConcini, the  Secretary explained\n\nthat increasing the  exemption to $3,000 would  have cost the\n\nfederal  government more  than  $200 million  and would  have\n\n                    \r                                \n\n45 C.F.R.   233.20(a)(3)(i)(B) (1993).\n\n4.

The named plaintiffs\n\nin  this case, Ellen Brown  and Mary Smith5,  are two mothers\n\non  low incomes  who were  denied AFDC  benefits in  1991 and\n\n1992, respectively, because they owned vehicles whose  equity\n\nvalues  exceeded  the  automobile  resource  exemption,  thus\n\nplacing  them over the general resource limit.  Brown owned a\n\n1989 Toyota Celica, Smith  a 1990 Mercury Topaz.   Both Brown\n\nand Smith live in  rural areas of New Hampshire,  where there\n\nis  no adequate public transportation and  an automobile is a\n\npractical necessity.\n\n          Plaintiffs filed suit against the Secretary of HHS,\n\nchallenging  the  $1,500  automobile  resource  exemption  as\n\narbitrary and capricious  on two grounds.   They argued:  (1)\n\nthat  the  regulation  was   arbitrary  and  capricious  when\n\npromulgated in 1982; and (2)  that the Secretary's failure to\n\nadjust  the figure  for inflation has  made it  arbitrary and\n\ncapricious   today.     Plaintiffs  sought   declaratory  and\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.   These  are not  their  real names.

The  court\n\nwrote:  \"To use a  fourteen-year old  standard as  a criteria\n\n[sic]  of  the  equity  in a  motor  vehicle  in  1979  is an\n\nanachronism  considering the  purchasing  power of  a  dollar\n\ntoday.\"    The  court  enjoined the  Secretary  from  further\n\nrelying upon  the regulation  to deny benefits  to otherwise-\n\neligible New Hampshire residents.  The Secretary now appeals.\n\n                             III.\n\n          The issues in this appeal have been the  subject of\n\nconsiderable  litigation  in the  federal  courts.

The Secretary  reasoned that the\n\nfood stamp  survey provided an adequate picture of the equity\n\nownership of  AFDC recipients, since there  was a substantial\n\noverlap in the populations of food stamp and AFDC recipients.\n\nMoreover, the percentage  may even have been  greater than 96\n\npercent in  the AFDC population, since  food stamp recipients\n\nare, on  average, more  affluent than  AFDC recipients.   The\n\nSecretary explained:\n\n          We  chose  $1,500 as  the  maximum equity\n          value for an automobile on the basis of a\n          Spring   1979   survey   of  food   stamp\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.

When   AFDC\nrecipients  first  challenged  the  instant  regulation,  the\nSecretary  was unable  to produce  a copy  of the  food stamp\nstudy.   Accordingly, the district  court in that  first case\nfound the regulation arbitrary and capricious, given the lack\nof supporting  data  in the  record.

The\r                    \nSecretary has  since  been able  to  produce the  study,  and\nsubsequent challenges have included the study in the record.\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          recipients.

In that the\n          Federal  maximum  limit  should   be  set\n          within the range of  the vast majority of\n          current  recipients  and  given that  the\n          food  stamp population  tends  to be,  on\n          average,   more    affluent   than   AFDC\n          recipients, this limit appears reasonable\n          and supportable.\n\n47 Fed.

See 42\r                                                                      \n\nU.S.C.   601 (1988); Shea v.

In light of  these\n\npurposes, plaintiffs  read OBRA's delegation  of authority to\n\nthe  Secretary to  set the  automobile resource  exemption as\n\nindicating that Congress intended  to allow each recipient to\n\nretain a  safe, reliable  vehicle.  According  to plaintiffs,\n\nthe  Secretary was obliged  to consider such  factors as: (1)\n\nthe costs of  used cars; (2) regional  conditions that impact\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ntransportation  needs;  (3)  the  importance of  vehicles  in\n\nenabling families to become self-sufficient.   In considering\n\nonly whether the \"vast majority\"  of AFDC recipients would be\n\naffected by  the new figure, plaintiffs  argue, the Secretary\n\npromulgated  a   regulation   that  was   inconsistent   with\n\ncongressional intent.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.\r                                                 \n\n          We do not agree.

Supp. 1097, on\r                                                  \n\nwhich  the Fourth Circuit rested its judgment.

OBRA delegates to the Secretary, and to no one else,\n\nthe  unqualified authority  to  prescribe the  amount of  the\n\nautomobile resource  exemption.  42 U.S.C.    602(a)(7)(B)(i)\n\n(Supp. V 1993).   Congress made no express provision  for the\n\nstandards that  the Secretary was to  apply when establishing\n\nthe  amount  of the  automobile  exemption.   Nowhere  in the\n\nstatute did Congress require the  Secretary to ensure to  all\n\nAFDC recipients the right  to a \"safe and reliable\"  vehicle,\n\nor to pay  special attention to  the other policy  objectives\n\nurged  by plaintiffs.  Congress  left it to  the Secretary to\n\ndecide what  policies should be given  priority when figuring\n\nthe exemption.\n\n          The  plain purpose  of OBRA,  moreover, was  to cut\n\ncosts by limiting the number of AFDC recipients to only those\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nwho were most needy.8  To that end, Congress  cut the overall\n\nresource limit in half, from  $2,000 to $1,000.  At  the same\n\ntime,  the value  of  the automobile,  previously  completely\n\nexempted,  would now be limited  by regulation.   S. Rep.

The $1,500 figure  the Secretary\n\nadopted, while consistent  with OBRA's cost-cutting  purpose,\n\ninsofar  as it  placed  a  cap  on  the  exemption,  was  not\n\nexceptionally  restrictive at  the time  it was  adopted; the\n\nSecretary  calculated  that it  would  exempt as  many  as 96\n\npercent of  then-current AFDC recipients.   This effect would\n\nappear less  draconian than the effect  of Congress's halving\n\nthe overall resource limit, from $2,000 to $1,000.  \n\n          After  the  regulation  was  promulgated,  Congress\n\nitself twice  considered and  twice rejected any  increase in\n\n                    \r                                \n\n8.

Plaintiffs argue  that  the  food  stamp  and  AFDC\n\nprograms are two distinct programs with different eligibility\n\nrequirements.  They further  insist that there is no  support\n\nin the  administrative record for  the Secretary's assumption\n\nthat there is  \"extensive overlap\" in the two  populations or\n\nthat the food stamp population  is, on average, more affluent\n\nthan  the AFDC  population.  Plaintiffs  say that  food stamp\n\nrecipients  were  already  subject  to   an  automobile-asset\n\nlimitation at the time of the study, while AFDC recipients at\n\nthat time were not subject to  such a limitation.  Thus,  the\n\nfact that  96  percent of  food  stamp recipients  owning  an\n\nautomobile  had equity  of less  than $1,500 may  simply have\n\nbeen  a  function of  the  food  stamp program's  preexisting\n\nequity limits.  \n\n          Micro-arguments of  this sort, however,  ignore the\n\nbreadth of the Secretary's discretion.  The Secretary was not\n\nrequired to base her regulations only on perfect information.\n\nRather,  the  Secretary's policy  choice  needed  only to  be\n\n\"rational.\"  See State  Farm, 463 U.S. at 43;  Frederick, 862\r                                                                    \n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nF.

It is undisputed  that the food\r                 \n\nstamp  study provided the  best data  available at  the time.\n\nThe study was based  on a 1979 survey which  collected asset-\n\nownership data  from a  statistically valid sample  of 11,300\n\nhouseholds of all income levels nationwide.  Paul Bordes, who\n\nprovided  technical   support  to  the  Secretary  while  the\n\nregulation  was being  promulgated, noted  in his  deposition\n\nthat equity  data on  aid recipients  were extremely  hard to\n\ncome by.   None of the  comments at that  time suggested  any\n\nother sources of  data.11  There  was evidence, moreover,  of\n\noverlap in the food stamp and AFDC populations.  Bordes noted\n\nthat  in 1981,  approximately 80  percent of  AFDC recipients\n\n                    \r                                \n\n11.  Plaintiffs  now suggest  that the  same raw  1979 census\ndata  that provided the basis  for the study  could have been\nused to  perform  a  separate  study  on  assets  among  AFDC\nrecipients.     Yet,  at   the  time  the   regulations  were\npromulgated,  such  a  study  had  not  been  performed  and,\naccording to the Secretary,  would have consumed a tremendous\namount of scarce resources to perform.  The Secretary was not\nrequired  to  use   the  most  accurate  data   theoretically\npossible.   It was not unreasonable for the Secretary to rely\non the  already-available study as an  approximate measure of\nasset  ownership among  AFDC recipients,  rather than  commit\nagency resources  to the performance of  an additional, time-\nconsuming study.\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nalso  received  food stamps.   And  the assumption  that AFDC\n\nrecipients  were on the  whole more affluent  than food stamp\n\nrecipients was a judgment within  the expertise of the agency\n\nto make.   That assumption was  undisputed at the time.   We,\n\ntherefore, believe  the Secretary acted rationally in relying\n\non  the  food  stamp  study  as  a  rough   approximation  of\n\nautomobile equity ownership among AFDC recipients.\n\n          Plaintiffs also point to alleged  statistical flaws\n\nin  the study itself.   Plaintiffs argue that  the 96 percent\n\nfigure (for  food stamp recipients who  owned automobiles and\n\nhad  equity in those automobiles under $1,500) was based on a\n\ncomputational  error,  since   it  erroneously  included  the\n\npercentage of the  recipients who  did not own  cars at  all.\n\nPlaintiffs suggest  (and the  Secretary now concedes)  that a\n\nmore accurate  figure would be  90 percent.   Plaintiffs also\n\nargue  that the figure assumes that, within the 17 percent of\n\nrecipients  for whom  there  were no  automobile-equity  data\n\navailable,  the distribution  of automobile  equity ownership\n\nwas identical to  that within the  population for which  data\n\nwere available    i.e.  that there was no systematic  bias in\n\nthe reporting of vehicle equity.   Plaintiffs argue that this\n\nassumption is unwarranted, since  it is reasonable to suppose\n\nthat  those owning  higher valued  automobiles would  be more\n\nlikely to  fail to provide information  on automobile equity,\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nfor  fear  of disqualifying  themselves  from  the program.12\n\nPlaintiffs  argue that these  statistical flaws  rendered the\n\nSecretary's reliance on the study unreasonable. \n\n          We agree  with the  Eighth Circuit in  Champion and\r                                                                     \n\nthe Fourth Circuit in Falin that, even assuming that the more\r                                       \n\naccurate figure  is 90 percent,  the study  still provided  a\n\nrational basis  for the  Secretary's finding that  the $1,500\n\nlimit was \"within the  range of the vast majority  of current\n\nrecipients,\" since 90 percent is still a \"vast majority.\"  47\n\nFed.

Where there was no  evidence of bias, it  was not\n\nunreasonable for the Secretary to assume for the  purposes of\n\ncalculation that no such bias existed.  Thus neither of these\n\nalleged   statistical  weaknesses   rendered  the   study  an\n\ninsufficient basis for the Secretary's regulation.\n\n     3.   Secretary Responded Adequately to Comments\r                                                                \n\n          Plaintiffs also  argue  that the  Secretary  failed\n\nadequately  to  respond  to   comments  and  criticisms  when\n\npromulgating the regulation.

Some  of  these\n\ncomments criticized  the relevance  and validity of  the food\n\nstamp study.  In response, the Secretary wrote: \n\n          We stand by  our original position.   The\n          choice  of $1,500  as the  maximum equity\n          value for  an automobile was based on the\n          data  from a Spring  1979 survey  of food\n          stamp recipients.  We regard the limit of\n          $1,500  equity value in  an automobile as\n          reasonable and supportable.\n\n47 Fed. Reg. at 5657.   Plaintiffs argue that this was  not a\n\nmeaningful response to the  comments, and that the regulation\n\ntherefore violated  the notice and comment  provisions of the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.   553(c) (1988)13.\n\n          We  do  not agree.    Only  a dozen  comments  were\n\nsubmitted on the automobile  resource exemption, of which ten\n\ntook  issue with the $1,500  amount.  Each  of these comments\n\nwas  fairly brief,  criticizing the  figure as  generally too\n\nlow.  Only one of them suggested an alternative to the $1,500\n\nfigure.   None of  them suggested  any alternative  data upon\n\nwhich to base the figure.

Nowhere does OBRA  or the AFDC  statute require the\n\nSecretary to set the  automobile exemption high enough so  as\n\nto enable all or most AFDC recipients to acquire and maintain\n\na  \"safe and  reliable  vehicle.\"   As  there was  no  stated\n\nobligation of this sort  in the first instance, there  can be\n\nno obligation to implement such a standard now.  \n\n          The  Secretary  reasonably  defends her  continuing\n\nadherence  to  the  $1,500  figure   without  adjustment  for\n\ninflation on the ground that this is consistent with both the\n\ntext  and  purpose of  OBRA.   There is  no language  in OBRA\n\nobligating   the  Secretary   periodically   to  adjust   the\n\nautomobile resource  exemption for inflation, nor, as earlier\n\ndiscussed, does OBRA tell the  Secretary to set the cap at  a\n\nfigure  that  will furnish  a  certain  quality or  level  of\n\ntransportation.

The fact that Congress itself has\r                    \n\nnot  adjusted so  closely-related  a provision  for inflation\n\nsuggests that  the Secretary's similar refusal  to adjust the\n\nregulation  is  not plainly  inconsistent  with congressional\n\nintent.  See American Home Protection, 312 F.2d at 4.18  \r                                                 \n\n                    \r                                \n\na \"safe and  reliable vehicle.\"   As we  have seen,  however,\nOBRA  provides no  such  standard to  inform the  Secretary's\ndiscretion on a continuing basis.  \n\n18.  Plaintiffs take  issue with  the Secretary's failure  to\nadjust  the  figure  after  being  asked  by  the  conference\ncommittee  to review the regulation in the wake of passage of\nthe  Family Support  Act  of  1988.    They  argue  that  the\nSecretary's failure  to adjust  the figure was  arbitrary and\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n          We   recognize,  as   a  possible   argument,  that\n\nCongress's  action  in  legislating  an   express  automobile\n\nexemption might  be interpreted, by  implication, to  prevent\n\nthe  Secretary  from ever  setting the  amount  so low  as to\n\neliminate  the exemption altogether, i.e. a zero cap or a cap\n\ninsufficient   to  allow   most  applicants   to  possess   a\n\nserviceable vehicle.   Counter  to this argument  is evidence\n\nstrongly suggesting that  the automobile  exemption     which\n\nhad for a long time existed as a  creature of the Secretary's\n\nearlier  regulations      was  expressly incorporated  in the\n\nstatute  in  1981 in  order  to  make  clear the  Secretary's\n\nauthority  and  duty to  keep  the  exemption within  bounds.\n\nImmediately before  OBRA, the  automobile exemption  had been\n\nunlimited, the Secretary's earlier attempt at a $1,200 cap on\n\na  vehicle's market value having been  overturned by the D.C.\n\nCircuit in 1976.

By expressly  delegating to the  Secretary unqualified\n\nauthority to  prescribe the  equity amount of  the exemption,\n\nCongress resurrected a cap and unequivocally  put the ball in\n\nthe Secretary's court.  Given OBRA's primary cost-cutting aim\n\n                    \r                                \n\ncapricious.  However, the conference committee did not direct\nthe  Secretary  to  revise  the  figure;  it  only  asked the\nSecretary  to review  the  figure  and  \"revise  [it]  if  he\r                                                                         \ndetermined revision would be appropriate.\"  1988 U.S.S.C.A.N.\r                                                    \nat  2976-77 (emphasis  added).   The  Secretary reviewed  the\nregulation and determined that  revision was not appropriate.\nSee  56 Fed.  Reg.  17,358,  17,358  (1991).    No  more  was\r               \nrequired.\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\n   and  Congress's evident desire to  strengthen, not weaken,\n\nthe Secretary's control over the amount of the exemption    a\n\nzero cap or its functional equivalent, designed to avoid even\n\nworse  offsets in other areas  of the program,  might well be\n\nwithin the Secretary's power  to prescribe.  But we  need not\n\ndecide if this  is so.  Even were we  to assume, for purposes\n\nof  argument,  that the  Secretary  would lack  the  power to\n\nreduce the  exemption to  zero or its  functional equivalent,\n\nthe  present case does  not involve  an amount  so low.   One\n\nthousand five-hundred  dollars may be consistent  only with a\n\ncar  that is  eight to  nine  years old,  with 80,000-120,000\n\nmiles  on  it      as   plaintiffs'  expert  opined      but,\n\npresumably,  there  are many  such  cars still  on  the road.\n\nNothing  in the record indicates to the contrary, or that the\n\nSecretary's continued  use of a  $1,500 equity figure  is the\n\nfunctional   equivalent   of   eliminating   altogether   the\n\nautomobile exemption.19\n\n          We  conclude  that   the  Secretary's  inaction  in\n\nrespect  to  modifying the  $1,500  figure  for inflation  is\n\nsupportable  both  under OBRA's  express  language  and as  a\n\nreasonable construction  of congressional intent.   There is,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n19.  That  the $1,500  reflects the  owner's equity,  and not\nnecessarily the  total value  of the  car,  raises a  further\nquestion,  on which this record sheds little light, as to how\nrestrictive the  exemption  is, in  practice, in  disallowing\nserviceable vehicles.    Nor  do  we know  how  many  persons\notherwise eligible  for AFDC are currently  eliminated by the\n$1,500 cap.\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\ntherefore,  no \"compelling\" circumstance \"suggesting that the\n\nagency has been blind  to the source of its  delegated power\"\n\nsuch as to warrant our ordering a rulemaking.

In 1982, the Secretary determined\n\non the basis  of the  then available data  that $1,500  would\n\ninclude the \"vast  majority\" of AFDC recipients.   Because of\n\nthe effects of inflation, that can no longer be assumed to be\n\ntrue, plaintiffs  point out.  Accordingly,  plaintiffs argue,\n\nthe  regulation is  today  arbitrary and  capricious, as  the\n\nfigure is inconsistent  with the  agency's stated  rationale.\n\n(This was the  argument that prevailed in Hazard v. Sullivan,\r                                                                        \n\n827 F. Supp. 1348 (M.D. Tenn. 1993),  one of the two district\n\ncourt cases that struck down the regulation).\n\n          The Secretary responds,  reasonably we think,  that\n\nher predecessor's  stated rationale  for the  1982 regulation\n\nneed not  be interpreted as  an ongoing commitment  to ensure\n\nthat  the vast majority of AFDC recipients are able to retain\n\nan automobile.  Rather, the  rationale can, and the Secretary\n\nargues should,  be interpreted  as a desire  to \"grandfather\"\n\nthose  who were receiving AFDC  at that time,  i.e. to ensure\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nthat  large numbers  of existing  recipients not  be abruptly\n\nterminated.  In parsing the language in the federal register,\n\nthe  Secretary places  the  emphasis on  the word  \"current\":\n\n\"the  Federal maximum limit should be set within the range of\n\nthe  vast majority of  current recipients .  . . .\"   47 Fed.\r                                          \n\nReg.  at 5657-58 (emphasis added).   Thus, even assuming that\n\nover time the  limit has excluded  more and more  individuals\n\nfrom  AFDC, that  is  not necessarily  inconsistent with  the\n\noriginal stated rationale.   Moreover, nothing in the statute\n\nnecessarily  requires  the  Secretary  to  include  the \"vast\n\nmajority\" of AFDC  recipients in setting the limit.   Indeed,\n\neven though  an earlier  Secretary emphasized this  factor in\n\n1982, nothing  obligates the present Secretary  to follow the\n\nsame policy priorities.  See Garnett, 905 F.2d at 782.20\r                                                \n\n                    \r                                \n\n20.  Plaintiffs  also argue  that the  failure to  adjust the\nautomobile resource exemption for inflation  is arbitrary and\ncapricious  when  compared  to the  Secretary's  actions with\nrespect to  similar  provisions in  other  benefit  programs.\nPlaintiffs point  to the  vehicle asset limitation  under the\nSupplemental  Security  Income (\"SSI\")  program.   Plaintiffs\nargue that in  1979, prior  to the promulgation  of the  AFDC\nautomobile  resource  exemption,  the  Secretary  proposed to\nincrease the pre-existing SSI automobile  exemption to \"allow\nfor inflation.\"  44 Fed. Reg. 43,265 (1979).  \n\n     We  agree with the Secretary that this does not make the\nSecretary's refusal  to adjust the  AFDC automobile  resource\nexemption arbitrary  and capricious.   We note  that, despite\ninitially expressing its intent to do so, the Secretary never\nadjusted   the  SSI   automobile  exemption   for  inflation,\nconcluding instead that such  an adjustment was  unnecessary.\nSee  50 Fed. Reg.  42,683, 42,686 (1985).   Thus, there is in\r               \nfact no inconsistency.  Furthermore, plaintiffs cite no cases\nholding  that  an agency  must  treat  separate and  distinct\nbenefit  programs exactly the same.   There may  well be good\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\n     3.   One Final Note\r                                    \n\n          Having  concluded that the  Secretary's inaction in\n\nfailing to  adjust the $1,500  automobile resource  exemption\n\nfor inflation was  not violative of  the enabling statute  or\n\nother  law, we wish briefly to comment on a procedural matter\n\nnot raised  by either party: namely,  plaintiffs' bringing of\n\nthe inflation  claim without first petitioning  the Secretary\n\nfor  an  amendment  to  the  $1,500  exemption.    Under  the\n\nAdministrative  Procedure Act, \"[e]ach  agency shall  give an\n\ninterested  person  the  right  to  petition  for   issuance,\n\namendment, or  repeal of a rule.\"   5 U.S.C.    553(e) (1988)\r                     \n\n(emphasis  added).   Thus, prior  to challenging  an agency's\n\nfailure to revise a rule in light of changed circumstances, a\n\nparty can  seek redress  directly from  the agency  through a\n\npetition for amendment under   553(e).\n\n          Where, as here,  plaintiffs seek to raise a host of\n\nfactual and policy issues (such  as the impact of  inflation)\n\nin a matter over which Congress has vested the Secretary with\n\nprimary discretion, it was  patently appropriate and, in many\n\ninstances  could   be  essential,  for  plaintiffs   to  have\n\npetitioned the  agency before seeking judicial  redress.  Cf.\r                                                                         \n\nMyers v.

By\n\npresenting  the  arguments  for  amendment  directly  to  the\n\nagency, plaintiffs would have  placed before the agency their\n\nevidence regarding the effects of inflation on the ability of\n\nAFDC applicants  to obtain  transportation,21 and  would have\n\nenabled  the agency  to  take whatever  corrective action  it\n\nthought necessary.  If  the agency had granted the  petition,\n\nthere would have been no need for judicial review.  If, as is\n\nmore likely  given the  prior litigation on  this issue,  the\n\nagency had  denied the  petition, then judicial  review might\n\nhave been  greatly facilitated  by  the existence  of a  more\n\ndeveloped  agency  record22  or,   at  least,  of  an  agency\n\n                    \r                                \n\n21.

Plaintiffs  criticize the  Secretary's reliance,  in her\nbrief,  on  arguments   which  plaintiffs   call  \"post   hoc\nrationalization[s]\" for not adjusting  the $1,500 figure  for\ninflation.  But plaintiffs can  hardly complain of this where\nthey  voluntarily  by-passed  the  agency in  order  to  come\nstraight to court.  Despite plaintiffs' criticisms, moreover,\nsome   indication  of   a  specific,   non-\"post-hoc\"  policy\nconsideration can  be gleaned from  the 1992 letter  from the\nprevious  Secretary  to  Senator  Dennis  DeConcini,  already\ndiscussed  supra.   In that  letter, the  Secretary explained\r                            \nthat  raising the  figure to  $3,000  would cost  the federal\ngovernment $200 million and  require corresponding offsets in\nother programs.

The  exhaustion doctrine,  as applied  in this  case, is\nclosely analogous to  the doctrine  of primary  jurisdiction,\nunder which a court  may refrain from exercising jurisdiction\nover a controversy until an agency has had a chance to decide\nan issue of fact or policy within that  agency's jurisdiction\nand  special competence.

The regulation, called the \"automobile resource exemption,\" limits to $1,500 the equity value of the automobile a family may own before the automobile's equity value affects the family's qualification to receive AFDC benefits.  45 C.F.R. Sec. 233.20(a)(3)(i)(B)(2) (1993).

Sec. 601 (1988).  Although states, as the primary administrators of the program, are given broad discretion to define benefit levels and eligibility requirements, state programs must conform with federal laws and regulations in order to receive matching federal funds.  Id. Federal HHS regulations set maximum limits on the resources a family may own and still qualify to receive AFDC benefits.  Under the regulations in effect before 1975, families with more than $2,000 in real and personal property did not qualify for AFDC benefits.  45 C.F.R. Sec. 233.20(a)(3) (1974).  These early regulations exempted from the calculation of family resources the value of certain assets, including, without limitation, the value of one automobile.

The new regulation set the cap at $1,200 retail market value--any market value in an automobile exceeding the $1,200 limit would now count toward the overall resource limit.  40 Fed.Reg. 12,507 (1975).  The D.C. Circuit, however, subsequently struck down the regulation in National Welfare Rights Org. v. Mathews, 533 F.2d 637, 643 (D.C.Cir.1976).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Thus after 1976, the automobile exemption was once again governed by the prior version of the regulation, which completely exempted the value of one automobile from the calculation of family resources.

Shalala, 33 F.3d 963, 967 (8th Cir.1994).  At the same time, Congress allowed states to exclude from calculation of the overall resource limit \"so much of the family member's ownership interest in one automobile as does not exceed such amount as the Secretary may prescribe.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 602(a)(7)(B)(i) (Supp.  V 1993) (emphasis added).

No. 100-485, 102 Stat. 2343, 2356 (1988), a bill containing a provision that would have allowed some states to experiment with a $4,500 automobile resource exemption.  The Senate version of the bill did not contain such a provision.  The conference committee adopted the Senate version, but directed the Secretary to review the automobile resource regulations \"and to revise them if he determines revision would be appropriate.\"   H.R.Conf.Rep.

After reviewing the regulation, the Secretary in 1991 declined to revise the figure.  55 Fed.Reg. 44,524 (1990);  56 Fed.Reg. 17,358 (1991).  In a 1992 letter to Senator Dennis DeConcini, the Secretary explained that increasing the exemption to $3,000 would have cost the federal government more than $200 million and would have required corresponding offsets in other programs.

Sec. 602(a)(7)(B)(i) (Supp.  V 1993) (emphasis added).  No standard was legislatively set to guide the Secretary in prescribing the exemption.

The Secretary reasoned that the food stamp survey provided an adequate picture of the equity ownership of AFDC recipients, since there was a substantial overlap in the populations of food stamp and AFDC recipients.  Moreover, the percentage may even have been greater than 96 percent in the AFDC population, since food stamp recipients are, on average, more affluent than AFDC recipients.  The Secretary explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>We chose $1,500 as the maximum equity value for an automobile on the basis of a Spring 1979 survey of food stamp recipients.  Data from that survey suggest that 96 percent of all food stamp recipients who own cars had equity value in them of $1,500 or less.  In that the Federal maximum limit should be set within the range of the vast majority of current recipients and given that the food stamp population tends to be, on average, more affluent than AFDC recipients, this limit appears reasonable and supportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">47 Fed.Reg. 5648, 5657-58 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Plaintiffs concede that OBRA was enacted primarily to reduce cost and limit the number of AFDC recipients, but argue that the court must also look to AFDC's broader purposes of promoting employment and fostering self-sufficiency.  See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 601 (1988);  Shea v. Vialpando, 416 U.S. 251, 253, 94 S.Ct. 1746, 1750, 40 L.Ed.2d 120 (1974).  In light of these purposes, plaintiffs read OBRA's delegation of authority to the Secretary to set the automobile resource exemption as indicating that Congress intended to allow each recipient to retain a safe, reliable vehicle.  According to plaintiffs, the Secretary was obliged to consider such factors as:  (1) the costs of used cars;  (2) regional conditions that impact transportation needs;  (3) the importance of vehicles in enabling families to become self-sufficient.  In considering only whether the \"vast majority\" of AFDC recipients would be affected by the new figure, plaintiffs argue, the Secretary promulgated a regulation that was inconsistent with congressional intent.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, 103 S.Ct. at 2866.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree.  We have little to add, on this point, to the opinion of the Eighth Circuit and to the opinion of the district court in Falin, 776 F.Supp. 1097, on which the Fourth Circuit rested its judgment.  Falin, 6 F.3d at 207.   OBRA delegates to the Secretary, and to no one else, the unqualified authority to prescribe the amount of the automobile resource exemption.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 602(a)(7)(B)(i) (Supp.  V 1993).  Congress made no express provision for the standards that the Secretary was to apply when establishing the amount of the automobile exemption.  Nowhere in the statute did Congress require the Secretary to ensure to all AFDC recipients the right to a \"safe and reliable\" vehicle, or to pay special attention to the other policy objectives urged by plaintiffs.  Congress left it to the Secretary to decide what policies should be given priority when figuring the exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain purpose of OBRA, moreover, was to cut costs by limiting the number of AFDC recipients to only those who were most needy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  To that end, Congress cut the overall resource limit in half, from $2,000 to $1,000.  At the same time, the value of the automobile, previously completely exempted, would now be limited by regulation.  S.Rep. No. 139, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 503 (1981), reprinted in 1981 U.S.C.C.A.N. 396, 769-70.  The $1,500 figure the Secretary adopted, while consistent with OBRA's cost-cutting purpose, insofar as it placed a cap on the exemption, was not exceptionally restrictive at the time it was adopted;  the Secretary calculated that it would exempt as many as 96 percent of then-current AFDC recipients.  This effect would appear less draconian than the effect of Congress's halving the overall resource limit, from $2,000 to $1,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the regulation was promulgated, Congress itself twice considered and twice rejected any increase in the Secretary's $1,500 automobile resource limit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  While nonaction by Congress is ordinarily a dubious guide, see Brown v. Gardner, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 552, 557, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994), it may become significant where proposals for legislative change have been repeatedly rejected, see Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 599-601, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 2032-34, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983).  The failed legislative attempts since 1982 to increase the automobile exemption plainly suggest that the regulation as written was not inconsistent with congressional intent.  See United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544, 554 n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 2470, 2476 n. 10, 61 L.Ed.2d 68 (1979) (\"[O]nce an agency's statutory construction has been fully brought to the attention of the public and the Congress, and the latter has not sought to alter that interpretation although it has amended the statute in other respects, then presumably the legislative intent has been correctly discerned.\")  (quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs read too much from the broader purposes of AFDC, and not enough from the specific purpose of OBRA, which was the legislation that actually authorized the Secretary to set the regulation.  See Brewer v. Madigan, 945 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir.1991) (\"The enabling statute ... is the principal source of relevant factors to be considered by the agency in promulgating regulations.\")  (citations omitted).  Even if, as plaintiffs argue, the existence of the automobile resource exemption implies that Congress intended AFDC recipients to be able to retain some kind of vehicle,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Congress explicitly delegated the authority to the Secretary to determine exactly how much of a person's equity in the vehicle to exempt.  See Frederick, 862 F.Supp. at 43-44;  Gorrie v. Bowen, 809 F.2d 508, 516 n. 12 (8th Cir.1987) (\"appeals to the 'fundamental purpose' of the AFDC program ... are unhelpful\" where Congress has initiated a change in policy (citations omitted));  see also Rodriguez v.

Food Stamp Survey Provided Rational Basis</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find little merit in plaintiffs' assertion that the food stamp study did not provide a rational basis for the Secretary's establishment of the $1,500 automobile equity limit.  Plaintiffs argue that the food stamp and AFDC programs are two distinct programs with different eligibility requirements.  They further insist that there is no support in the administrative record for the Secretary's assumption that there is \"extensive overlap\" in the two populations or that the food stamp population is, on average, more affluent than the AFDC population.  Plaintiffs say that food stamp recipients were already subject to an automobile-asset limitation at the time of the study, while AFDC recipients at that time were not subject to such a limitation.  Thus, the fact that 96 percent of food stamp recipients owning an automobile had equity of less than $1,500 may simply have been a function of the food stamp program's preexisting equity limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Micro-arguments of this sort, however, ignore the breadth of the Secretary's discretion.  The Secretary was not required to base her regulations only on perfect information.  Rather, the Secretary's policy choice needed only to be \"rational.\"   See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, 103 S.Ct. at 2866;  Frederick, 862 F.Supp. at 42 (stating that the issue is not \"whether the Secretary used the best available source to develop a regulation, but whether the Secretary's conduct was reasonable\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary here acted reasonably in relying on the food stamp study.  Accord Champion, 33 F.3d at 966;  Falin, 776 F.Supp. at 1101.   It is undisputed that the food stamp study provided the best data available at the time.  The study was based on a 1979 survey which collected asset-ownership data from a statistically valid sample of 11,300 households of all income levels nationwide.  Paul Bordes, who provided technical support to the Secretary while the regulation was being promulgated, noted in his deposition that equity data on aid recipients were extremely hard to come by.  None of the comments at that time suggested any other sources of data.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  There was evidence, moreover, of overlap in the food stamp and AFDC populations.  Bordes noted that in 1981, approximately 80 percent of AFDC recipients also received food stamps.  And the assumption that AFDC recipients were on the whole more affluent than food stamp recipients was a judgment within the expertise of the agency to make.  That assumption was undisputed at the time.  We, therefore, believe the Secretary acted rationally in relying on the food stamp study as a rough approximation of automobile equity ownership among AFDC recipients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also point to alleged statistical flaws in the study itself.  Plaintiffs argue that the 96 percent figure (for food stamp recipients who owned automobiles and had equity in those automobiles under $1,500) was based on a computational error, since it erroneously included the percentage of the recipients who did not own cars at all.  Plaintiffs suggest (and the Secretary now concedes) that a more accurate figure would be 90 percent.  Plaintiffs also argue that the figure assumes that, within the 17 percent of recipients for whom there were no automobile-equity data available, the distribution of automobile equity ownership was identical to that within the population for which data were available--i.e. that there was no systematic bias in the reporting of vehicle equity.  Plaintiffs argue that this assumption is unwarranted, since it is reasonable to suppose that those owning higher valued automobiles would be more likely to fail to provide information on automobile equity, for fear of disqualifying themselves from the program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Plaintiffs argue that these statistical flaws rendered the Secretary's reliance on the study unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Eighth Circuit in Champion and the Fourth Circuit in Falin that, even assuming that the more accurate figure is 90 percent, the study still provided a rational basis for the Secretary's finding that the $1,500 limit was \"within the range of the vast majority of current recipients,\" since 90 percent is still a \"vast majority.\"  47 Fed.Reg. at 5657;  see Champion, 33 F.3d at 967 n. 5;  Falin, 776 F.Supp. at 1100, aff'd per curiam, 6 F.3d 207.   Although plaintiffs suggest that systematic bias in underreporting was possible, they have presented no evidence that it actually occurred.  Where there was no evidence of bias, it was not unreasonable for the Secretary to assume for the purposes of calculation that no such bias existed.  Thus neither of these alleged statistical weaknesses rendered the study an insufficient basis for the Secretary's regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Secretary Responded Adequately to Comments</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that the Secretary failed adequately to respond to comments and criticisms when promulgating the regulation.  Plaintiffs contend that, during the rulemaking process, the Secretary received numerous comments critical of the $1,500 limit.  Some of these comments criticized the relevance and validity of the food stamp study.  In response, the Secretary wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>We stand by our original position.  The choice of $1,500 as the maximum equity value for an automobile was based on the data from a Spring 1979 survey of food stamp recipients.  We regard the limit of $1,500 equity value in an automobile as reasonable and supportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">47 Fed.Reg. at 5657.  Plaintiffs argue that this was not a meaningful response to the comments, and that the regulation therefore violated the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(c) (1988)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree.  Only a dozen comments were submitted on the automobile resource exemption, of which ten took issue with the $1,500 amount.  Each of these comments was fairly brief, criticizing the figure as generally too low.  Only one of them suggested an alternative to the $1,500 figure.  None of them suggested any alternative data upon which to base the figure.  Given the nature of the comments, we do not find the Secretary's brief response so inadequate as to violate Sec. 553(c).  Accord Champion, 33 F.3d at 966 n. 4;  cf. Brewer, 945 F.2d at 457 n. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the $1,500 automobile exemption was neither arbitrary nor capricious when promulgated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Regulation Valid Today</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs insist that, even if the regulation was valid when promulgated, it must be arbitrary and capricious today given the Secretary's failure to increase the $1,500 cap for inflation.  While a refusal to amend a rule, like the promulgation of the rule in the first instance, may be reviewable under the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> \"[r]eview under the 'arbitrary and capricious' tag line ... encompasses a range of levels of deference to the agency, and ... an agency's refusal to institute rulemaking proceedings is at the high end of the range.\"  American Horse Protection Ass'n v. Lyng, 812 F.2d 1, 4 (D.C.Cir.1987) (citations omitted).  Thus, a refusal to institute rulemaking \"is to be overturned 'only in the rarest and most compelling of circumstances,' which have primarily involved 'plain errors of law, suggesting that the agency has been blind to the source of its delegated power.' \"  Id. at 5 (citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Nothing of the sort appears here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Not Inconsistent With Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs reiterate their position that, in light of AFDC's general scheme, OBRA evinces an intent that AFDC recipients be able to retain a safe and reliable vehicle.  Plaintiffs then argue that, even if the regulation were consistent with this purpose when promulgated, the Secretary's failure to adjust the $1,500 figure for inflation necessarily makes it inconsistent with this broader purpose today.  The increase in the consumer price index since 1982 has effectively halved the value of $1,500.  Accordingly, that equity level is today consistent only with a car that is eight to nine years old and has 80,000-120,000 miles on it.  Because such a car is not likely to be safe or reliable, plaintiffs argue, the regulation today violates OBRA's broader purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with their argument in the previous section, plaintiffs read too much into the broad scheme of the AFDC program and not enough into the cost-cutting purpose of OBRA, the statute that actually authorized the Secretary to set the figure.  Nowhere does OBRA or the AFDC statute require the Secretary to set the automobile exemption high enough so as to enable all or most AFDC recipients to acquire and maintain a \"safe and reliable vehicle.\"   As there was no stated obligation of this sort in the first instance, there can be no obligation to implement such a standard now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary reasonably defends her continuing adherence to the $1,500 figure without adjustment for inflation on the ground that this is consistent with both the text and purpose of OBRA.  There is no language in OBRA obligating the Secretary periodically to adjust the automobile resource exemption for inflation, nor, as earlier discussed, does OBRA tell the Secretary to set the cap at a figure that will furnish a certain quality or level of transportation.  Instead, by its terms, OBRA gives the Secretary unqualified discretion to prescribe the figure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Had Congress wanted to require the Secretary to make periodic adjustments for inflation, it could easily have said so in the statute, and indeed has done so in other instances.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. Sec. 415(i) (social security benefits) (1988);  29 U.S.C. Sec. 720(c) (1988) (vocational rehabilitation grants);  5 U.S.C. Sec. 8340 (1988) (annuities for retired federal employees);  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub.L. No. 103-66, 107 Stat. 312, 675 (1993) (codified at 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2014(g)(2) (Supp.  V 1993)) (automobile exemption under food stamp program).  Nor--given the total absence of any standards within the statute--can an obligation to adjust for inflation be inferred from a statutory guide to the Secretary's discretion implying the necessity to maintain the exemption at a certain level over time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Compare Maine Ass'n of Interdependent Neighborhoods v. Petit, 659 F.Supp. 1309, 1323 (D.Me.1987).  The Secretary, furthermore, plausibly contends that her failure to adjust the cap is consistent with OBRA's original purpose to move towards tightening the AFDC eligibility requirements over time.  S.Rep. No. 139 at 503, reprinted in 1981 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 769-70;  Dickenson, 692 F.2d at 179.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have earlier pointed out, it is also highly significant that Congress has twice since 1981 considered revising the $1,500 figure and on both occasions has declined to do so, suggesting its implicit acceptance of the Secretary's failure to adjust the figure upwards.  See Rutherford, 442 U.S. at 554 n. 10, 99 S.Ct. at 2476 n. 10.   Congress itself, moreover, has never seen fit to adjust for inflation the related overall resource limit of $1,000 which it set in 1981.  See Champion, 33 F.3d at 967.   The fact that Congress itself has not adjusted so closely-related a provision for inflation suggests that the Secretary's similar refusal to adjust the regulation is not plainly inconsistent with congressional intent.  See American Horse Protection, 812 F.2d at 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, as a possible argument, that Congress's action in legislating an express automobile exemption might be interpreted, by implication, to prevent the Secretary from ever setting the amount so low as to eliminate the exemption altogether, i.e. a zero cap or a cap insufficient to allow most applicants to possess a serviceable vehicle.  Counter to this argument is evidence strongly suggesting that the automobile exemption--which had for a long time existed as a creature of the Secretary's earlier regulations--was expressly incorporated in the statute in 1981 in order to make clear the Secretary's authority and duty to keep the exemption within bounds.  Immediately before OBRA, the automobile exemption had been unlimited, the Secretary's earlier attempt at a $1,200 cap on a vehicle's market value having been overturned by the D.C.Circuit in 1976.  National Welfare Rights Organ., 533 F.2d at 647.   By expressly delegating to the Secretary unqualified authority to prescribe the equity amount of the exemption, Congress resurrected a cap and unequivocally put the ball in the Secretary's court.  Given OBRA's primary cost-cutting aim--and Congress's evident desire to strengthen, not weaken, the Secretary's control over the amount of the exemption--a zero cap or its functional equivalent, designed to avoid even worse offsets in other areas of the program, might well be within the Secretary's power to prescribe.  But we need not decide if this is so.  Even were we to assume, for purposes of argument, that the Secretary would lack the power to reduce the exemption to zero or its functional equivalent, the present case does not involve an amount so low.  One thousand five-hundred dollars may be consistent only with a car that is eight to nine years old, with 80,000-120,000 miles on it--as plaintiffs' expert opined--but, presumably, there are many such cars still on the road.  Nothing in the record indicates to the contrary, or that the Secretary's continued use of a $1,500 equity figure is the functional equivalent of eliminating altogether the automobile exemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the Secretary's inaction in respect to modifying the $1,500 figure for inflation is supportable both under OBRA's express language and as a reasonable construction of congressional intent.  There is, therefore, no \"compelling\" circumstance \"suggesting that the agency has been blind to the source of its delegated power\" such as to warrant our ordering a rulemaking.  American Horse Protection Ass'n, 812 F.2d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Not Inconsistent With Original Rationale</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that, even if not necessarily contrary to OBRA's language and Congress's intent, the $1,500 figure today runs counter to the Secretary's original rationale for adopting it.  In 1982, the Secretary determined on the basis of the then available data that $1,500 would include the \"vast majority\" of AFDC recipients.  Because of the effects of inflation, that can no longer be assumed to be true, plaintiffs point out.  Accordingly, plaintiffs argue, the regulation is today arbitrary and capricious, as the figure is inconsistent with the agency's stated rationale.  (This was the argument that prevailed in Hazard v. Sullivan, 827 F.Supp. 1348 (M.D.Tenn.1993), one of the two district court cases that struck down the regulation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary responds, reasonably we think, that her predecessor's stated rationale for the 1982 regulation need not be interpreted as an ongoing commitment to ensure that the vast majority of AFDC recipients are able to retain an automobile.  Rather, the rationale can, and the Secretary argues should, be interpreted as a desire to \"grandfather\" those who were receiving AFDC at that time, i.e. to ensure that large numbers of existing recipients not be abruptly terminated.  In parsing the language in the federal register, the Secretary places the emphasis on the word \"current\":  \"the Federal maximum limit should be set within the range of the vast majority of current recipients....\"  47 Fed.Reg. at 5657-58 (emphasis added).  Thus, even assuming that over time the limit has excluded more and more individuals from AFDC, that is not necessarily inconsistent with the original stated rationale.  Moreover, nothing in the statute necessarily requires the Secretary to include the \"vast majority\" of AFDC recipients in setting the limit.  Indeed, even though an earlier Secretary emphasized this factor in 1982, nothing obligates the present Secretary to follow the same policy priorities.  See Garnett v. Sullivan, 905 F.2d 778, 782 (4th Cir.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. One Final Note</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the Secretary's inaction in failing to adjust the $1,500 automobile resource exemption for inflation was not violative of the enabling statute or other law, we wish briefly to comment on a procedural matter not raised by either party:  namely, plaintiffs' bringing of the inflation claim without first petitioning the Secretary for an amendment to the $1,500 exemption.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, \"[e]ach agency shall give an interested person the right to petition for issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.\"  5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(e) (1988) (emphasis added).  Thus, prior to challenging an agency's failure to revise a rule in light of changed circumstances, a party can seek redress directly from the agency through a petition for amendment under Sec. 553(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, plaintiffs seek to raise a host of factual and policy issues (such as the impact of inflation) in a matter over which Congress has vested the Secretary with primary discretion, it was patently appropriate and, in many instances could be essential, for plaintiffs to have petitioned the agency before seeking judicial redress.  Cf. Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding, 303 U.S. 41, 50-51, 58 S.Ct. 459, 463, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938) (It is \"the long settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\").  By presenting the arguments for amendment directly to the agency, plaintiffs would have placed before the agency their evidence regarding the effects of inflation on the ability of AFDC applicants to obtain transportation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> and would have enabled the agency to take whatever corrective action it thought necessary.  If the agency had granted the petition, there would have been no need for judicial review.  If, as is more likely given the prior litigation on this issue, the agency had denied the petition, then judicial review might have been greatly facilitated by the existence of a more developed agency record<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> or, at least, of an agency decision clarifying its particular policy reasons for the denial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Thus requiring a petition under these circumstances serves the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine (and the related doctrine of primary jurisdiction).  See, e.g., Midwater Trawlers Coop. v. Mosbacher, 727 F.Supp. 12, 15 (D.D.C.1989) (dismissing claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies where plaintiff failed to petition for rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(e));  Hoffmann-LaRoche v. Harris, 484 F.Supp. 58, 60 (D.D.C.1979) (same);  cf. Kappelmann v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 539 F.2d 165, 169, 171 (D.C.Cir.1976) (invoking doctrine of primary jurisdiction where plaintiff failed to petition for rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(e));  William V. Luneburg, Petitioning Federal Agencies for Rulemaking, 1988 Wis.L.Rev. 1, 55 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, while petitioning the agency would have been the better course, we have considered the merits of the claim on appeal without having demanded strict adherence to the doctrine of administrative exhaustion.  The doctrines of administrative exhaustion and primary jurisdiction are judge-made rules to be applied on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the purposes of the doctrines.  See McGee v. United States, 402 U.S. 479, 483, 91 S.Ct. 1565, 1568, 29 L.Ed.2d 47 (1971);  Pihl v. Massachusetts Dep't of Educ., 9 F.3d 184, 190 (1st Cir.1993);  2 Davis, supra, Sec. 15.2 at 307.  In this case, justice would not be served by remanding with directions to dismiss for nonexhaustion, nor is a remand to the agency for clarification of its reasons essential.  The claim turns primarily on issues of law concerning the scope of the Secretary's powers;  such issues of law we are equipped to settle (and have settled) now.  Moreover, the Secretary has not objected to the lack of a petition, and such a petition would likely be futile anyway as the Secretary appears to have taken a firm stand, litigating this issue in several fora.  Thus, the exact same issue would likely arise in the same posture after a petition was denied;  resolving it now would in fact conserve judicial resources.  See, e.g., Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 765-66, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2467, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975) (considering claim despite failure to exhaust where petition would clearly be futile).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have, therefore, decided the merits without requiring exhaustion, the exhaustion point should not go unnoticed.  Had the case turned, as might have occurred under a different statute or in different circumstances, on review of the agency's precise policy reasons for inaction, only a record from within the agency could have yielded a satisfactory basis for judicial review.  A trial in the district court would not be a viable alternative.  See Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 654, 110 S.Ct. 2668, 110 L.Ed.2d 579 (1990);  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420-21, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (holding that if an agency provides reasons insufficient to permit a court to review its rationale, the proper remedy is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation);  see also American Horse Protection Ass'n, 812 F.2d at 7-8 (remanding to agency after finding that agency had not provided sufficient reasons for its denial of a petition for rulemaking);  1 Davis, supra, Sec. 8.5 at 394.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, plaintiffs cite no cases, other than Hazard, that indicate that an agency must periodically consider inflation adjustments in setting its eligibility standards for government benefits, absent a legislative directive to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  The few cases that address the issue point the other way.  See, e.g., Garnett, 905 F.2d at 782-83 (Secretary not required to adjust guidelines for disability benefits to reflect changing market conditions, where statutory grant of discretion to set guidelines broad).  Plaintiffs have, in any case, presented no evidence indicating that the Secretary's failure to adjust the figure for inflation is inconsistent with OBRA.

See 50 Fed.Reg. 42,683, 42,686 (1985).  Thus, there is in fact no inconsistency.  Furthermore, plaintiffs cite no cases holding that an agency must treat separate and distinct benefit programs exactly the same.  There may well be good reasons for adjusting some provisions for inflation and not adjusting others.

Despite plaintiffs' criticisms, moreover, some indication of a specific, non-\"post-hoc\" policy consideration can be gleaned from the 1992 letter from the previous Secretary to Senator Dennis DeConcini, already discussed supra.   In that letter, the Secretary explained that raising the figure to $3,000 would cost the federal government $200 million and require corresponding offsets in other programs.

See New England Legal Found. v. Massachusetts Port Authority, 883 F.2d 157, 171-72 (1st Cir.1989).

The Secretary reasoned that the food stamp survey provided an adequate picture of the equity ownership of AFDC recipients, since there was a substantial overlap in the populations of food stamp and AFDC recipients.  Moreover, the percentage may even have been greater than 96 percent in the AFDC population, since food stamp recipients are, on average, more affluent than AFDC recipients.

In light of these purposes, plaintiffs read OBRA's delegation of authority to the Secretary to set the automobile resource exemption as indicating that Congress intended to allow each recipient to retain a safe, reliable vehicle.  According to plaintiffs, the Secretary was obliged to consider such factors as:  (1) the costs of used cars;  (2) regional conditions that impact transportation needs;  (3) the importance of vehicles in enabling families to become self-sufficient.  In considering only whether the \"vast majority\" of AFDC recipients would be affected by the new figure, plaintiffs argue, the Secretary promulgated a regulation that was inconsistent with congressional intent.

OBRA delegates to the Secretary, and to no one else, the unqualified authority to prescribe the amount of the automobile resource exemption.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 602(a)(7)(B)(i) (Supp.  V 1993).  Congress made no express provision for the standards that the Secretary was to apply when establishing the amount of the automobile exemption.  Nowhere in the statute did Congress require the Secretary to ensure to all AFDC recipients the right to a \"safe and reliable\" vehicle, or to pay special attention to the other policy objectives urged by plaintiffs.

The $1,500 figure the Secretary adopted, while consistent with OBRA's cost-cutting purpose, insofar as it placed a cap on the exemption, was not exceptionally restrictive at the time it was adopted;  the Secretary calculated that it would exempt as many as 96 percent of then-current AFDC recipients.

Plaintiffs argue that the food stamp and AFDC programs are two distinct programs with different eligibility requirements.  They further insist that there is no support in the administrative record for the Secretary's assumption that there is \"extensive overlap\" in the two populations or that the food stamp population is, on average, more affluent than the AFDC population.  Plaintiffs say that food stamp recipients were already subject to an automobile-asset limitation at the time of the study, while AFDC recipients at that time were not subject to such a limitation.  Thus, the fact that 96 percent of food stamp recipients owning an automobile had equity of less than $1,500 may simply have been a function of the food stamp program's preexisting equity limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Micro-arguments of this sort, however, ignore the breadth of the Secretary's discretion.

The study was based on a 1979 survey which collected asset-ownership data from a statistically valid sample of 11,300 households of all income levels nationwide.  Paul Bordes, who provided technical support to the Secretary while the regulation was being promulgated, noted in his deposition that equity data on aid recipients were extremely hard to come by.  None of the comments at that time suggested any other sources of data.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  There was evidence, moreover, of overlap in the food stamp and AFDC populations.  Bordes noted that in 1981, approximately 80 percent of AFDC recipients also received food stamps.  And the assumption that AFDC recipients were on the whole more affluent than food stamp recipients was a judgment within the expertise of the agency to make.  That assumption was undisputed at the time.  We, therefore, believe the Secretary acted rationally in relying on the food stamp study as a rough approximation of automobile equity ownership among AFDC recipients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also point to alleged statistical flaws in the study itself.  Plaintiffs argue that the 96 percent figure (for food stamp recipients who owned automobiles and had equity in those automobiles under $1,500) was based on a computational error, since it erroneously included the percentage of the recipients who did not own cars at all.  Plaintiffs suggest (and the Secretary now concedes) that a more accurate figure would be 90 percent.  Plaintiffs also argue that the figure assumes that, within the 17 percent of recipients for whom there were no automobile-equity data available, the distribution of automobile equity ownership was identical to that within the population for which data were available--i.e. that there was no systematic bias in the reporting of vehicle equity.  Plaintiffs argue that this assumption is unwarranted, since it is reasonable to suppose that those owning higher valued automobiles would be more likely to fail to provide information on automobile equity, for fear of disqualifying themselves from the program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Plaintiffs argue that these statistical flaws rendered the Secretary's reliance on the study unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Eighth Circuit in Champion and the Fourth Circuit in Falin that, even assuming that the more accurate figure is 90 percent, the study still provided a rational basis for the Secretary's finding that the $1,500 limit was \"within the range of the vast majority of current recipients,\" since 90 percent is still a \"vast majority.\"  47 Fed.Reg. at 5657;  see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677097\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Champion,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/677097/teral-champion-v-donna-e-shalala-department-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">967</span> </a></span>n. 5;  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Falin,</span> <span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Although plaintiffs suggest that systematic bias in underreporting was possible, they have presented no evidence that it actually occurred.  Where there was no evidence of bias, it was not unreasonable for the Secretary to assume for the purposes of calculation that no such bias existed.

Plaintiffs contend that, during the rulemaking process, the Secretary received numerous comments critical of the $1,500 limit.  Some of these comments criticized the relevance and validity of the food stamp study.

None of them suggested any alternative data upon which to base the figure.  Given the nature of the comments, we do not find the Secretary's brief response so inadequate as to violate Sec. 553(c).

Not Inconsistent With Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs reiterate their position that, in light of AFDC's general scheme, OBRA evinces an intent that AFDC recipients be able to retain a safe and reliable vehicle.  Plaintiffs then argue that, even if the regulation were consistent with this purpose when promulgated, the Secretary's failure to adjust the $1,500 figure for inflation necessarily makes it inconsistent with this broader purpose today.  The increase in the consumer price index since 1982 has effectively halved the value of $1,500.  Accordingly, that equity level is today consistent only with a car that is eight to nine years old and has 80,000-120,000 miles on it.  Because such a car is not likely to be safe or reliable, plaintiffs argue, the regulation today violates OBRA's broader purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with their argument in the previous section, plaintiffs read too much into the broad scheme of the AFDC program and not enough into the cost-cutting purpose of OBRA, the statute that actually authorized the Secretary to set the figure.  Nowhere does OBRA or the AFDC statute require the Secretary to set the automobile exemption high enough so as to enable all or most AFDC recipients to acquire and maintain a \"safe and reliable vehicle.\"   As there was no stated obligation of this sort in the first instance, there can be no obligation to implement such a standard now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary reasonably defends her continuing adherence to the $1,500 figure without adjustment for inflation on the ground that this is consistent with both the text and purpose of OBRA.  There is no language in OBRA obligating the Secretary periodically to adjust the automobile resource exemption for inflation, nor, as earlier discussed, does OBRA tell the Secretary to set the cap at a figure that will furnish a certain quality or level of transportation.  Instead, by its terms, OBRA gives the Secretary unqualified discretion to prescribe the figure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Had Congress wanted to require the Secretary to make periodic adjustments for inflation, it could easily have said so in the statute, and indeed has done so in other instances.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. Sec. 415(i) (social security benefits) (1988);  29 U.S.C. Sec. 720(c) (1988) (vocational rehabilitation grants);  5 U.S.C.

Sec. 2014(g)(2) (Supp.  V 1993)) (automobile exemption under food stamp program).  Nor--given the total absence of any standards within the statute--can an obligation to adjust for inflation be inferred from a statutory guide to the Secretary's discretion implying the necessity to maintain the exemption at a certain level over time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Compare Maine Ass'n of Interdependent Neighborhoods v.

The fact that Congress itself has not adjusted so closely-related a provision for inflation suggests that the Secretary's similar refusal to adjust the regulation is not plainly inconsistent with congressional intent.

Counter to this argument is evidence strongly suggesting that the automobile exemption--which had for a long time existed as a creature of the Secretary's earlier regulations--was expressly incorporated in the statute in 1981 in order to make clear the Secretary's authority and duty to keep the exemption within bounds.  Immediately before OBRA, the automobile exemption had been unlimited, the Secretary's earlier attempt at a $1,200 cap on a vehicle's market value having been overturned by the D.C.Circuit in 1976.  National Welfare Rights <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334733\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Organ.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/334733/national-welfare-rights-organization-v-f-david-mathews-secretary-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span>.   By expressly delegating to the Secretary unqualified authority to prescribe the equity amount of the exemption, Congress resurrected a cap and unequivocally put the ball in the Secretary's court.  Given OBRA's primary cost-cutting aim--and Congress's evident desire to strengthen, not weaken, the Secretary's control over the amount of the exemption--a zero cap or its functional equivalent, designed to avoid even worse offsets in other areas of the program, might well be within the Secretary's power to prescribe.  But we need not decide if this is so.  Even were we to assume, for purposes of argument, that the Secretary would lack the power to reduce the exemption to zero or its functional equivalent, the present case does not involve an amount so low.  One thousand five-hundred dollars may be consistent only with a car that is eight to nine years old, with 80,000-120,000 miles on it--as plaintiffs' expert opined--but, presumably, there are many such cars still on the road.  Nothing in the record indicates to the contrary, or that the Secretary's continued use of a $1,500 equity figure is the functional equivalent of eliminating altogether the automobile exemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the Secretary's inaction in respect to modifying the $1,500 figure for inflation is supportable both under OBRA's express language and as a reasonable construction of congressional intent.

Because of the effects of inflation, that can no longer be assumed to be true, plaintiffs point out.  Accordingly, plaintiffs argue, the regulation is today arbitrary and capricious, as the figure is inconsistent with the agency's stated rationale.  (This was the argument that prevailed in Hazard v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1348</span> </span>(M.D.Tenn.1993), one of the two district court cases that struck down the regulation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary responds, reasonably we think, that her predecessor's stated rationale for the 1982 regulation need not be interpreted as an ongoing commitment to ensure that the vast majority of AFDC recipients are able to retain an automobile.  Rather, the rationale can, and the Secretary argues should, be interpreted as a desire to \"grandfather\" those who were receiving AFDC at that time, i.e. to ensure that large numbers of existing recipients not be abruptly terminated.  In parsing the language in the federal register, the Secretary places the emphasis on the word \"current\":  \"the Federal maximum limit should be set within the range of the vast majority of current recipients....\"  47 Fed.Reg. at 5657-58 (emphasis added).  Thus, even assuming that over time the limit has excluded more and more individuals from AFDC, that is not necessarily inconsistent with the original stated rationale.  Moreover, nothing in the statute necessarily requires the Secretary to include the \"vast majority\" of AFDC recipients in setting the limit.  Indeed, even though an earlier Secretary emphasized this factor in 1982, nothing obligates the present Secretary to follow the same policy priorities.  See Garnett v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543108\"><a href=\"/opinion/543108/30-socsecrepser-185-unemplinsrep-cch-15730a-william-f-garnett-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 782 (4th Cir.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. One Final Note</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the Secretary's inaction in failing to adjust the $1,500 automobile resource exemption for inflation was not violative of the enabling statute or other law, we wish briefly to comment on a procedural matter not raised by either party:  namely, plaintiffs' bringing of the inflation claim without first petitioning the Secretary for an amendment to the $1,500 exemption.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, \"[e]ach agency shall give an interested person the right to petition for issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.\"  5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(e) (1988) (emphasis added).  Thus, prior to challenging an agency's failure to revise a rule in light of changed circumstances, a party can seek redress directly from the agency through a petition for amendment under Sec. 553(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, plaintiffs seek to raise a host of factual and policy issues (such as the impact of inflation) in a matter over which Congress has vested the Secretary with primary discretion, it was patently appropriate and, in many instances could be essential, for plaintiffs to have petitioned the agency before seeking judicial redress.  Cf. Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102952\"><a href=\"/opinion/102952/myers-v-bethlehem-shipbuilding-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 50-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102952\"><a href=\"/opinion/102952/myers-v-bethlehem-shipbuilding-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span> </a></span>(1938) (It is \"the long settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\").  By presenting the arguments for amendment directly to the agency, plaintiffs would have placed before the agency their evidence regarding the effects of inflation on the ability of AFDC applicants to obtain transportation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> and would have enabled the agency to take whatever corrective action it thought necessary.  If the agency had granted the petition, there would have been no need for judicial review.  If, as is more likely given the prior litigation on this issue, the agency had denied the petition, then judicial review might have been greatly facilitated by the existence of a more developed agency record<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> or, at least, of an agency decision clarifying its particular policy reasons for the denial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Thus requiring a petition under these circumstances serves the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine (and the related doctrine of primary jurisdiction).

The doctrines of administrative exhaustion and primary jurisdiction are judge-made rules to be applied on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the purposes of the doctrines.  See McGee v.

In this case, justice would not be served by remanding with directions to dismiss for nonexhaustion, nor is a remand to the agency for clarification of its reasons essential.  The claim turns primarily on issues of law concerning the scope of the Secretary's powers;  such issues of law we are equipped to settle (and have settled) now.  Moreover, the Secretary has not objected to the lack of a petition, and such a petition would likely be futile anyway as the Secretary appears to have taken a firm stand, litigating this issue in several fora.  Thus, the exact same issue would likely arise in the same posture after a petition was denied;  resolving it now would in fact conserve judicial resources.  See, e.g., Weinberger v. Salfi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109308\"><a href=\"/opinion/109308/weinberger-v-salfi/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 765-66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109308\"><a href=\"/opinion/109308/weinberger-v-salfi/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Had the case turned, as might have occurred under a different statute or in different circumstances, on review of the agency's precise policy reasons for inaction, only a record from within the agency could have yielded a satisfactory basis for judicial review.  A trial in the district court would not be a viable alternative.  See Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v.

A court rarely has enough information to second guess agency decisions premised on this type of reasoning.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The district court ignored the fact that Congress has delegated policy-making in this area to the Secretary.  It thought the $1,500 figure to be inadequate for various policy reasons that it elucidated:</p>\n        <p>Used today, [the $1,500 automobile equity exemption] can result in an AFDC recipient losing his or her job by not allowing the recipient the availability of a safe operative motor vehicle in lieu of a schlock vehicle.  The end result would be for the government or other relief agencies making up the difference in lost income.  It destroys initiative of those who are endeavoring to get off the public dole and exacerbates the personal degradation of many who are reluctantly on relief only as a last resort.</p>\n        <p>However, the courts are not empowered by Congress to impose their concepts of good policy on the Secretary.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> A need to adjust for inflation might be implied, for example, if the statute had explicitly stated that the Secretary must set the automobile exemption at an amount high enough at all times to ensure that AFDC recipients can retain a \"safe and reliable vehicle.\"   As we have seen, however, OBRA provides no such standard to inform the Secretary's discretion on a continuing basis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs take issue with the Secretary's failure to adjust the figure after being asked by the conference committee to review the regulation in the wake of passage of the Family Support Act of 1988.  They argue that the Secretary's failure to adjust the figure was arbitrary and capricious.  However, the conference committee did not direct the Secretary to revise the figure;  it only asked the Secretary to review the figure and \"revise [it] if he determined revision would be appropriate.\"   1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2976-77 (emphasis added).  The Secretary reviewed the regulation and determined that revision was not appropriate.  See 56 Fed.Reg. 17,358, 17,358 (1991).  No more was required</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> That the $1,500 reflects the owner's equity, and not necessarily the total value of the car, raises a further question, on which this record sheds little light, as to how restrictive the exemption is, in practice, in disallowing serviceable vehicles.  Nor do we know how many persons otherwise eligible for AFDC are currently eliminated by the $1,500 cap</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also argue that the failure to adjust the automobile resource exemption for inflation is arbitrary and capricious when compared to the Secretary's actions with respect to similar provisions in other benefit programs.  Plaintiffs point to the vehicle asset limitation under the Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") program.  Plaintiffs argue that in 1979, prior to the promulgation of the AFDC automobile resource exemption, the Secretary proposed to increase the pre-existing SSI automobile exemption to \"allow for inflation.\"  44 Fed.Reg. 43,265 (1979)</p>\n        <p>We agree with the Secretary that this does not make the Secretary's refusal to adjust the AFDC automobile resource exemption arbitrary and capricious.  We note that, despite initially expressing its intent to do so, the Secretary never adjusted the SSI automobile exemption for inflation, concluding instead that such an adjustment was unnecessary.  See 50 Fed.Reg. 42,683, 42,686 (1985).  Thus, there is in fact no inconsistency.  Furthermore, plaintiffs cite no cases holding that an agency must treat separate and distinct benefit programs exactly the same.  There may well be good reasons for adjusting some provisions for inflation and not adjusting others.

Sec. 555(e) (1988) provides:</p>\n        <p>Prompt notice shall be given of the denial in whole or in part of a written application, petition, or other request of an interested person made in connection with any agency proceeding.  Except in affirming a prior denial or when the denial is self-explanatory, the notice shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the grounds for denial.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs criticize the Secretary's reliance, in her brief, on arguments which plaintiffs call \"post hoc rationalization[s]\" for not adjusting the $1,500 figure for inflation.  But plaintiffs can hardly complain of this where they voluntarily by-passed the agency in order to come straight to court.  Despite plaintiffs' criticisms, moreover, some indication of a specific, non-\"post-hoc\" policy consideration can be gleaned from the 1992 letter from the previous Secretary to Senator Dennis DeConcini, already <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">discussed</span> supra</span>.   In that letter, the Secretary explained that raising the figure to $3,000 would cost the federal government $200 million and require corresponding offsets in other programs.

See New England Legal Found. v. Massachusetts Port Authority, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528192\"><a href=\"/opinion/528192/new-england-legal-foundation-v-massachusetts-port-authority-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 171-72 (1st Cir.1989).  Both doctrines serve to allocate decision-making authority between agencies and the courts, and both doctrines look to similar considerations of judicial economy, agency expertise, etc.  See 1 Davis, supra, Sec. 14.1 at 271</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs cite Maine Ass'n of Interdependent Neighborhood v.

However, we agree with the Secretary that MAIN is distinguishable.  MAIN involved the agency's use of data that was already eight years old at the time that it was used to promulgate the rule.  Moreover, the delegation of rulemaking authority in that case was more circumscribed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
