Davis  Velez appeals from a district  court\r                           \r\n\njudgment affirming a decision of the  Secretary of Health and\r\n\nHuman   Services  denying  Velez's   application  for  social\r\n\nsecurity disability benefits.  We affirm.\r\n\n     Velez applied for social security benefits on  September\r\n\n10, 1992, alleging  that he  could not work  due to  \"nerves,\r\n\nback, and ankle pain.\"  After a hearing, an Adminstrative Law\r\n\nJudge (ALJ) concluded  that Velez has a severe combination of\r\n\nimpairments with a history of herniated nucleus pulposus  and\r\n\ndepression and anxiety related disorders.  He also found that\r\n\nVelez is unable  to perform his past work.   However, the ALJ\r\n\nconcluded that Velez has the residual functional capacity for\r\n\nlight work,  exclusive  of  jobs  requiring  him  to  perform\r\n\ncomplex tasks or to have frequent contact with the public.\r\n\nFinally,  the ALJ  ruled that,  based on  the testimony  of a\r\n\nvocational expert (VE) and application of the Grid,  Velez is\r\n\nnot disabled because  there are light, unskilled jobs that he\r\n\ncan perform. \r\n\n     Velez  does not  argue  on  appeal  that  he  lacks  the\r\n\nphysical capacity for  light work.   Instead, he argues  that\r\n\nthe ALJ  erred  in  his  findings  regarding  Velez's  mental\r\n\ncapacity.    We  review  the  Secretary's  decision  under  a\r\n\n\"substantial evidence\" standard; we will affirm that decision\r\n\nif  it  is  supported  by   \"`such  relevant  evidence  as  a\r\n\nreasonable  mind  might  accept  as  adequate  to  support  a\r\n\nconclusion.'\"    Richardson v.

Although\r\n\nVelez appeared  anxious and  somewhat depressed, he  was also\r\n\ncooperative,  logical, and  coherent  with apparently  normal\r\n\nintellect.   He  was diagnosed  as suffering  from adjustment\r\n\nproblems,   with   depressive   mood,   and   was  prescribed\r\n\nmedication.\r\n\n     Between September  11, 1992 and January  22, 1993, Velez\r\n\nwas  seen on  six occasions  at the  State Insurance  Fund in\r\n\nconnection with  his mental condition.   On October  7, 1992,\r\n\nDr.  Lopez  Cumpiano evaluated  Velez  and  diagnosed him  as\r\n\nsuffering  from  anxiety  disorder  with  depressive  traits.\r\n\nAlthough  Dr. Lopez  noted  that Velez  reported episodes  of\r\n\nauditive and  visual hallucinations, he found  that Velez was\r\n\nin   contact   with   reality   and   presented   no  thought\r\n\ndisturbances.   He  also  found  that  Velez  was  clear  and\r\n\noriented,  with  fair   memory,  unimpaired  judgment,   fair\r\n\ninsight, and  preserved intellectual ability.   The remaining\r\n\nrecords  from   the  State   Insurance  Fund  are   not  very\r\n\ninformative, but Velez is consistently described as alert and\r\n\noriented.  \r\n\n     On  November 10, 1992, Velez was  examined by Dr. Mojica\r\n\nSandoz,  a consultant to the  Secretary.  Dr. Mojica observed\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthat  Velez  was markedly  anxious  and tense,  and  that his\r\n\nmovements were somewhat slow.  However, Dr. Mojica found that\r\n\nVelez was accessible, cooperative, and frank, and that he did\r\n\nnot show any difficulty  in establishing adequate and lasting\r\n\ninterpersonal relationships.  He further found that Velez had\r\n\nadequate capacity  to pay  attention and to  concentrate, was\r\n\noriented, functioned with an average intellectual makeup, and\r\n\nhad  adequate  judgment  and   memory.    The  diagnosis  was\r\n\nmoderate, generalized anxiety disorder.  \r\n\n     A  non-examining medical  consultant  to  the  Secretary\r\n\nreviewed  much   of  this  evidence  and   completed  both  a\r\n\nPsychiatric  Review Technique  form  and  a  Mental  Residual\r\n\nFunctional  Capacity Assessment.    Although  the  consultant\r\n\nnoted   some  moderate  limitations   on  various  capacities\r\n\nrequired  for  unskilled   work,  he   reached  the   general\r\n\nconclusion that  Velez is  capable of  functioning in a  non-\r\n\ndemanding   work   environment--with   simple   instructions,\r\n\nroutines, and  decisions--as long as Velez is not required to\r\n\nhave  frequent  contact  with  the general  public.1    These\r\n\nlatter limitations were reflected  in a hypothetical posed to\r\n\nthe VE, who, in  turn, identified specific jobs in  the local\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  A second  consultant, who apparently reviewed  all of the\r\nevidence,  agreed  with  the  first  consultant's conclusions\r\nwithout additional comment.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\neconomy that Velez could  perform.2  Under the circumstances,\r\n\nwe  think that there  is substantial evidence  to support the\r\n\nSecretary's  finding of no disability.  We add that since the\r\n\nALJ  adopted the  consultant's general  conclusions regarding\r\n\nVelez's  mental  limitations,  any differences  in  the boxes\r\n\nchecked  on the Psychiatric Review Technique  form by the ALJ\r\n\nand the consultant are of no consequence.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Velez suggests that the hypothetical posed to the  VE was\r\nincomplete since  it  did not  include  all of  the  moderate\r\nlimitations noted by the consultant.  See Arocho v. Secretary\r                                                                         \r\nof  Health &amp; Human Servs., 670  F.2d 374, 375 (1st Cir. 1982)\r                                     \r\n(hypothetical    must     accurately    reflect    claimant's\r\nlimitations).    This  argument  was  not  presented  to  the\r\ndistrict  court, and we deem it waived.  See, e.g., Sandstrom\r                                                                         \r\nv. Chemlawn Corp., 904 F.2d  83, 87 (1st Cir. 1990).   In any\r                             \r\nevent, we  think  that the  consultant's  findings  regarding\r\nthese  moderate  limitations  were subsumed  in  his  general\r\nconclusion,  and that  the hypothetical  accurately reflected\r\nthis conclusion.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

The remaining records from the State Insurance Fund are not very informative, but Velez is consistently described as alert and oriented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 10, 1992, Velez was examined by Dr. Mojica Sandoz, a consultant to the Secretary.  Dr. Mojica observed that Velez was markedly anxious and tense, and that his movements were somewhat slow.  However, Dr. Mojica found that Velez was accessible, cooperative, and frank, and that he did not show any difficulty in establishing adequate and lasting interpersonal relationships.  He further found that Velez had adequate capacity to pay attention and to concentrate, was oriented, functioned with an average intellectual makeup, and had adequate judgment and memory.  The diagnosis was moderate, generalized anxiety disorder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A non-examining medical consultant to the Secretary reviewed much of this evidence and completed both a Psychiatric Review Technique form and a Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment.  Although the consultant noted some moderate limitations on various capacities required for unskilled work, he reached the general conclusion that Velez is capable of functioning in a non-demanding work environment--with simple instructions, routines, and decisions--as long as Velez is not required to have frequent contact with the general public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  These latter limitations were reflected in a hypothetical posed to the VE, who, in turn, identified specific jobs in the local economy that Velez could perform.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Under the circumstances, we think that there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary's finding of no disability.  We add that since the ALJ adopted the consultant's general conclusions regarding Velez's mental limitations, any differences in the boxes checked on the Psychiatric Review Technique form by the ALJ and the consultant are of no consequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A second consultant, who apparently reviewed all of the evidence, agreed with the first consultant's conclusions without additional comment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Velez suggests that the hypothetical posed to the VE was incomplete since it did not include all of the moderate limitations noted by the consultant.  See Arocho v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399275\"><a href=\"/opinion/399275/bienvenido-arocho-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 375 (1st Cir.1982) (hypothetical must accurately reflect claimant's limitations).  This argument was not presented to the district court, and we deem it waived.  See, e.g., Sandstrom v. Chemlawn Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542293\"><a href=\"/opinion/542293/richard-l-sandstrom-etc-v-chemlawn-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.1990).  In any event, we think that the consultant's findings regarding these moderate limitations were subsumed in his general conclusion, and that the hypothetical accurately reflected this conclusion</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
