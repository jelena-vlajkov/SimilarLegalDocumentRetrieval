Appellants  brought this  medical\n          Cyr, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\nmalpractice action in  the United States  District Court for  the\n\nDistrict  of Puerto Rico on  April 15, 1991.   Thereafter, appel-\n\nlants repeatedly  violated various discovery-related  orders duly\n\nentered by the district  court.  On November 10,  1992, following\n\nnumerous  requests  and  three  unsuccessful  motions  to  compel\n\ndiscovery, the  appellee moved for sanctions  against appellants,\n\nincluding the dismissal of all their claims, with prejudice.  See\n                                                                 \n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).  On March 15, 1993, almost two years after\n\nits commencement,  the district court dismissed  the action, with\n\nprejudice, due to  appellants' \"consistent failure  to diligently\n\nprosecute their claims despite the specific deadlines  set by the\n\nCourt to respond to interrogatories and furnish discovery related\n\nto expert witnesses.\"   Appellants did not move  for reconsidera-\n\ntion, but chose to seek appellate relief.  We affirm.\n\n          We review  Rule 41(b)  dismissals for abuse  of discre-\n\ntion.   Aoude v. Mobil Oil  Corp., 892 F.2d 1115,  1117 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1989).  After careful  consideration of all relevant circumstanc-\n\nes, under  the \"open-ended  balancing test\" appropriate  in these\n\nmatters,  Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria,  896 F.2d 645,  648 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1990),  we conclude  that the  district court  did not  abuse its\n\ndiscretion.  We do  so in light of appellants'  repeated failures\n\nto comply  with reasonable discovery requests  and with discovery\n\norders, notwithstanding the district court's clear warnings  that\n\ndismissal could \n\nresult; the unsuccessful efforts by the district court to  assure\n\ncompliance by imposing,  in the first instance,  the lesser sanc-\n\ntion  of a $300 fine  against appellants' counsel;  the months of\n\ndelay,  and the many motions  and conferences before the district\n\ncourt,   occasioned  by their  dilatory conduct;  their counsel's\n\nfailure either to take  appropriate action in a timely  manner or\n                                                                 \n\nto present to the  district court many of the  belated justifica-\n\ntions urged on appeal.  In addition, the justifications belatedly\n\nproffered on appeal, credited at  face value, provide no explana-\n\ntion for the  final two-month delay  (January to March 15,  1993)\n\nduring which counsel  concededly was able to  function as counsel\n\nyet  failed  to comply  with  the  district court's  longstanding\n\ndiscovery  orders.  Finally, even  now counsel offers no explana-\n\ntion for failing to request reconsideration of the district court\n\ndismissal order entered March 15, 1993.\n\n          The  crux of  appellants'  argument on  appeal is  that\n\ntheir counsel's medical  problems prevented him from  functioning\n\nas a lawyer.   Unfortunately for appellants,  this claim presents\n\ntoo little, too late, to the  wrong court.  The dilatory behavior\n\nextended  at least  from  February through  November, 1992,  not-\n\nwithstanding that the district court warned of possible dismissal\n\nin March and  May, 1992, after  having ordered a  $300 fine as  a\n\nsanction against  appellants' counsel.1  Nevertheless,  not until\n\n                    \n\n     1At  a  status conference  in  August 1992,  the  court also\nwarned  of the  possible  dismissal of  the claims  of appellants\nMaria  de los Angeles and Jose Ivan Pi ero Rivera.  The dismissal\nof their claims is no longer challenged.\n\n                                3\n\nDecember 3, 1992, did appellants' counsel explain to the district\n\ncourt in an \"informational motion\" that he had been incapacitated\n\nfrom October 15 to November 24, 1992.  At best, this would excuse\n\nfive  and one-half weeks of  a sustained ten-month  delay, and no\n\nsufficient  reason  is suggested  for  the  failure to  prosecute\n\nduring other periods.  The failure to take any  further action in\n\nthe  district court after the filing of the December, 1992 infor-\n\nmational motion  is particularly  egregious.  Yet  even crediting\n\nall representations made by  appellants' counsel at oral argument\n\non appeal, no explanation  has been suggested for the  final two-\n\nmonth  delay  between January  and  March 15,  1993, or  for  the\n\nfailure  to  request  reconsideration  of  the  dismissal  order.\n\nAlthough  we are not unsympathetic  to appellants' plight in this\n\ncase, we  cannot  conclude that  the  district court  abused  its\n\ndiscretion by  dismissing their claims  by reason of  their coun-\n\nsel's abject failure to prosecute.2\n\n          Affirmed.3\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     2In  these egregious  circumstances,  we must  heed our  own\nadmonition  and  \"the teaching  of the  Court  in Link  v.
