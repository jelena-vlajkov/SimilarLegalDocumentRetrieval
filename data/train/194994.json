Defendant-appellant Kelley Mala,\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\na  resident of the U.S. Virgin Islands, appeals his conviction on\n\nvarious  drug-related  charges.   We  affirm,  without prejudice,\n\nhowever, to Mala's right to explore certain contentions in a more\n\nappropriate forum.\n\n                                I.\n                                  \n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          On January 4, 1989, a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico\n\nindicted Mala.  The grand jury twice revised the bill,  a process\n\nthat culminated in a  five-count superseding indictment against a\n\ntotal of  fourteen defendants.  Three  counts targeted appellant,\n\ncharging him  with conspiracy to  import cocaine into  the United\n\nStates, 21  U.S.C.    963 (1988),  conspiracy to possess  cocaine\n\nwith intent to distribute it, 21 U.S.C.   846 (1988), and using a\n\ntelephone  to  facilitate importation  of  cocaine,  21 U.S.C.   \n\n843(b) (1988). \n\n          Most of the named defendants were promptly arrested and\n\ntried.    Some  were convicted,1  some  were  not.   Withal,  the\n\ngovernment exhibited  seeming indifference toward  appellant.  It\n\nwas  not  until February  22,  1991    some  25 months  after the\n\noriginal indictment  surfaced    that government agents  arrested\n\n                    \n\n     1We affirmed the convictions.  See United States v. Valencia\n                                                                 \nLucena,  925  F.2d  506 (1st  Cir.  1991).    Although the  facts\n      \nsurrounding appellant's  alleged crimes  are, for the  most part,\nunimportant  to  the  disposition  of this  appeal,  the  factual\npredicate  of  his  case  is  substantially   the  same  as  that\nundergirding the other defendants'  convictions.  Accordingly, we\nrefer the reader who thirsts for additional detail to our earlier\nopinion.  See id. at 509-10, 512-13.\n                 \n\n                                2\n\nhim in St. Thomas, took him to Puerto Rico, and  arraigned him on\n\nMarch 8, 1991.\n\n          From that  point forward, matters progressed  at a more\n\nceleritous clip.   On  April 22,  1991,  Mala filed  a motion  to\n\ndismiss  the  indictment  on  speedy  trial  grounds, or  in  the\n\nalternative, to  suppress certain  evidence.  The  district court\n\ndenied  the motion  on May  17.   Four days  later, Mala  filed a\n\nnotice  of  appeal  contesting  the  denial  of  his  prayer  for\n\nsuppression.    Undeterred  by  the appeal,  the  district  court\n\nordered  the trial  to commence  on May  23, 1991,  as previously\n\nscheduled.  On May 30, a jury found appellant guilty on all three\n\ncounts.\n\n          Two potentially significant events occurred between the\n\ndate  of the verdict  and the imposition  of sentence.   Some six\n\nweeks   after  the   trial  ended,   this  court   dismissed  the\n\ninterlocutory appeal  for want of jurisdiction  after determining\n\nthat  the order refusing to suppress evidence was not immediately\n\nappealable.   In roughly the  same time frame,  appellant filed a\n\npro  se motion  alleging, among  other things,  that he  had been\n       \n\nvictimized  by ineffective  counsel.   The district  judge denied\n\nthis initiative on procedural grounds, ruling that such  a motion\n\ncould not be brought in advance of sentencing.\n\n          On November 8, 1991, the court sentenced appellant to a\n\nlengthy  prison term  and imposed  other penalties.   This appeal\n\nfollowed.  In it, appellant is represented by successor counsel.\n\n                                3\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                             Analysis\n                                     \n\n                                A.\n                                  \n\n                  The Trial Court's Jurisdiction\n                                                \n\n          Appellant seeks to persuade us that his conviction is a\n\nnullity because the district court lacked authority over the case\n\nat  time  of  trial.    The  linchpin  of  this  asseveration  is\n\nappellant's  insistence that  a  case cannot  be  pending in  two\n\ncourts at the same time; hence,  the pendency of his appeal  from\n\nthe  refusal  to  suppress  had the  double-barrelled  effect  of\n\ntransferring the  case to the  appellate court and  stripping the\n\ntrial court of jurisdiction.  We are not convinced.\n\n          Ordinarily,  docketing  a  notice  of  appeal  ousts  a\n\ndistrict court  of jurisdiction over  the underlying case.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Coastal Corp.  v. Texas  Eastern Corp., 869  F.2d 817,  819\n                                            \n\n(5th  Cir. 1989).   There  is,  however, an  important difference\n\nbetween  interlocutory  appeals  not specifically  authorized  by\n\nstatute  and other,  less problematic appeals.   While  an appeal\n\nfrom  either  a  final  order  or  an  interlocutory  order  made\n\nimmediately  appealable by  statute divests  a district  court of\n\nauthority to proceed with respect to any matter touching upon, or\n\ninvolved  in, the appeal,  see 9 James  W. Moore et  al., Moore's\n                                                                 \n\nFederal   Practice      203.11,  at   3-45  (2d  ed.   1993),  an\n                  \n\ninterlocutory  appeal  that  is  brought  without  any  colorable\n\njurisdictional  basis  does not  deprive  the  district court  of\n\n                                4\n\njurisdiction over  the underlying  case.   See  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nFerris,  751 F.2d 436, 440  (1st Cir. 1984);  Hodgson v. Mahoney,\n                                                                \n\n460  F.2d 326, 328  (1st Cir. 1972);  see also  9 Moore's Federal\n                                                                 \n\nPractice,  supra,    203.11,  at 3-52.    Thus, when  a  litigant\n                \n\npurposes to appeal a plainly unappealable order,  the trial court\n\nmay treat  the appeal for what it  is   a sham    and continue to\n\nexercise  jurisdiction over the case.  Were the rule otherwise, a\n\nlitigant  bent on vexation could temporarily divest a trial court\n\nof jurisdiction at whim.\n\n          This case aptly illustrates the point.  Two days before\n\nhis  trial  was  scheduled  to  start,  appellant  \"appealed\"  an\n\ninterlocutory order that had been entered a few days earlier.  He\n\ndid  not  identify   then,  nor  has   he  identified  now,   any\n\njurisdictional hook on which  his appeal arguably might hang.   A\n\ntransparently  invalid  appeal  constitutes  no  appeal  at  all.\n\nBecause  Mala's  appeal was  of this  sorry stripe,  the district\n\ncourt retained the authority to try the case.\n\n                                B.\n                                  \n\n                   The Right to a Speedy Trial\n                                              \n\n          Appellant  contends that the charges against him should\n\nhave  been  dismissed  because  of  unpardonable  delays  in  the\n\nproceedings.  This  contention must rise  or fall on  appellant's\n\nclaim  that  too long  a period  of  time intervened  between his\n\nindictment  and his arrest.2  This claim, in turn, implicates the\n\n                    \n\n     2Appellant also asserts that  the 75-day delay between March\n8  and  May 23  violated  the  statutory  requirement that  trial\ncommence within 70 days  following arraignment.  See 18  U.S.C.  \n                                                    \n\n                                5\n\nSixth Amendment, for the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C.    3161-3174\n\n(1988),  is  not applicable  to  periods  of delay  antedating  a\n\ndefendant's  arrest.  See United  States v. Zandi,  769 F.2d 229,\n                                                 \n\n233 (4th Cir. 1985); United States v. Haiges, 688 F.2d 1273, 1274\n                                            \n\n(9th Cir. 1982).\n\n          The Sixth Amendment provides in pertinent part that \"in\n\nall criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a\n\nspeedy .  .  . trial.\"    U.S. Const.,  Amend.  VI.   This  right\n\nattaches upon indictment or arrest,  whichever first occurs.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1981); Dillingham v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited  States,  423 U.S.  64, 64-65  (1975)  (per curiam).   The\n              \n\nconstitutional assurance serves many laudable purposes, chief  of\n\nwhich is  to  limit  the possibility  that  memories  will  fade,\n\nwitnesses  disappear, and  needless  delay  impair  an  accused's\n\nability  to defend himself.  See United States v. Ewell, 383 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n116, 120 (1966). \n\n          In  Barker v. Wingo,  407 U.S. 514  (1972), the Supreme\n                             \n\nCourt  established  a four-part  balancing  test  to be  used  in\n\ndetermining  whether  a  defendant's  constitutional  right  to a\n\nspeedy trial  has been abridged.  These  four factors are (1) the\n\nlength of  the delay;  (2) the  reasons for  the  delay; (3)  the\n\n                    \n\n3161(c)(1) (1988).   This assertion  need not detain  us.   Delay\n\"resulting from  any  pretrial motion,  from  the filing  of  the\nmotion  through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition  of,  such motion,\"  is  excludable  for purposes  of\ndetermining compliance vel  non with the statutory  mandate.  Id.\n                                                                 \nat     3161(h)(1)(F).   Since  appellant  filed several  pretrial\nmotions, including the April 22 motion (which was not disposed of\nuntil May 17, see supra  Part I), the thrust of his  Speedy Trial\n                       \nAct claim misses the mark.\n\n                                6\n\ndefendant's posture vis-a-vis the delay, especially in respect to\n\nassertions  of the  speedy  trial right;  and  (4) the  prejudice\n\nstemming from  the delay.  Id.  at 530.  These  factors cannot be\n                              \n\nplugged into  a formula that operates  with scientific precision.\n\nRather, they must be considered on a case-by-case basis \"together\n\nwith such other circumstances as may be relevant.\"  Id.\n                                                       \n\n          Attempting   to  apply   the   Barker   test   in   the\n                                               \n\ncircumstances at bar frustrates meaningful appellate review.  The\n\ndevoir  of persuasion rests with  the appellant to  show error in\n\nthe  ruling below.   Although  he filed  a motion to  dismiss the\n\nindictment  on speedy trial grounds, he did not accompany it with\n\naffidavits or  other materials of  evidentiary quality.   What is\n\nmore, he did not request an evidentiary hearing.  In the end, the\n\ndistrict  court denied the  motion without holding  a hearing and\n\nwithout making  specific findings.   The briefs on  appeal evince\n\nthat  the facts relevant to the second, third, and fourth furcula\n\nof the Barker test are  hotly disputed.  We have no  reliable way\n             \n\nof resolving these factual disputes in the rarified atmosphere of\n\nan appellate bench.  It follows inexorably that appellant  cannot\n\ncarry  his burden  of demonstrating  error in  the ruling  below:\n\nwithout better  factual insights, we  can neither  shrug off  the\n\npossible  existence of  a scenario  completely supportive  of the\n\ndistrict court's ruling nor measure the relative probabilities as\n\namong competing scenarios.   Consequently,  Mala's assignment  of\n\nerror cannot prevail.\n\n          To illustrate  our dilemma,  it might well  be, as  the\n\n                                7\n\ngovernment suggests,  that appellant  eluded arrest;  or, knowing\n\nabout the indictment, failed to assert his speedy trial right for\n\na protracted period of time;  or, having had the good fortune  to\n\nobserve  a dress rehearsal of  the government's case, suffered no\n\ncognizable  prejudice  through  the  delay.   If  an  evidentiary\n\nhearing  shows any  such scenario  to  be true    and  we do  not\n\nsuggest that  this will (or will not) prove to  be the case   the\n\nfacts  might   well  defeat   appellant's  speedy   trial  claim,\n\nnotwithstanding  the  extremely  long period  of  pre-arraignment\n\ndelay.3  See,  e.g., Doggett v. United  States, 112 S.  Ct. 2686,\n                                              \n\n2691 (1992); United  States v.  Brock, 782 F.2d  1442, 1447  (7th\n                                     \n\nCir. 1986).  On this inscrutable record, we simply cannot tell.\n\n          Nor  is it unbefitting to  decide the point  based on a\n\nburden-of-proof rule where, as here, appellant can fairly be held\n\naccountable  for the opacity of the record.  Under federal motion\n\npractice,  no automatic  entitlement  to  an evidentiary  hearing\n\nexists.  See Aoude v.  Mobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d 1115,  1120 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir.  1989) (explaining  that  pretrial motions  \"do not  usually\n\nculminate  in  evidentiary  hearings\").   Thus,  a  litigant  who\n\nbelieves that  evidence should be taken in  order to put a motion\n\n                    \n\n     3Although  a  25-month  period  of  delay is  \"presumptively\nprejudicial,\"  Barker,  407  U.S.  at  530,  it  is  nevertheless\n                     \nessential to inquire  into the remaining components  of the test.\nThe  length of the delay is merely \"a triggering mechanism,\" id.,\n                                                                \nand   courts  frequently  have  found  presumptively  prejudicial\nperiods  of  delay  to be  fully  justified  after  examining the\ncomplete  set of Barker factors.

Rigby,  896 F.2d 392, 395 (9th Cir.  1990).  Because an\n               \n\nevidentiary  hearing  was neither  sought  nor  convened in  this\n\ninstance,  the assignment  of error  premised on  the defendant's\n\nconstitutional  right to  a  speedy trial  succumbs  for want  of\n\nsatisfactory proof.4\n\n                                C.\n                                  \n\n                      Ineffective Assistance\n                                            \n\n          The Sixth Amendment also provides that persons  accused\n\nof crimes shall receive the benefit of counsel for their defense.\n\nSee  U.S. Const.,  Amend.

McGill,  952 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n16, 19 (1st  Cir. 1992); United States v.

The rule\n                   \n\nhas a  prudential aspect.  Since claims of ineffective assistance\n\ninvolve  a binary analysis   the defendant must show, first, that\n\ncounsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and, second,\n\nthat  the  deficient  performance  prejudiced  the  defense,  see\n                                                                 \n\nStrickland  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)   such claims\n                         \n\ntypically require  the resolution  of factual issues  that cannot\n\nefficaciously be addressed in the first instance by  an appellate\n\ntribunal.  See Costa, 890 F.2d at  483; Hoyas-Medina, 878 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n                    \n\n     5Mala did file  a motion  in the district  court seeking  to\nraise  the question of ineffective  assistance.  See  supra p. 3.\n                                                           \nNonetheless,   the  district  court   dismissed  the   motion  on\nprocedural  grounds  without  reaching   the  question  of  trial\ncounsel's effectiveness, and appellant  has not assigned error to\nthat ruling.  For our purposes, then, the motion is a nullity.\n\n                                10\n\n22.  In  addition, the trial judge, by  reason of his familiarity\n\nwith the case, is usually in the best position to assess both the\n\nquality of the legal representation afforded to the  defendant in\n\nthe  district court  and  the impact  of  any shortfall  in  that\n\nrepresentation.  Under ideal  circumstances, the court of appeals\n\nshould have  the benefit of this evaluation; elsewise, the court,\n\nin effect, may be playing blindman's buff.  \n\n          To be  sure, we have occasionally  undertaken review of\n\nineffective assistance claims on  direct appeal, even without the\n\nadvantage of the district court's views.  See, e.g., Natanel, 938\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 309.   But we travel  this route only  when the critical\n\nfacts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed\n\nto allow reasoned consideration of the claim.  See id.\n                                                      \n\n          Although appellant  invokes the exception on the theory\n\nthat  any  lawyer  worth   his  salt  would  have  requested   an\n\nevidentiary hearing, we  think this  case falls  well within  the\n\ncompass of the usual rule.  Even if we assume arguendo that trial\n                                                      \n\ncounsel's performance was constitutionally deficient, appellant's\n\nthesis runs afoul  of the  second prong of  the Strickland  test.\n                                                          \n\nUnder that prong, a criminal defendant must \"show that there is a\n\nreasonable  probability that,  but  for counsel's  unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result  of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n\nStrickland,  466 U.S.  at 694.   On  the sparse  record presently\n          \n\ncompiled,  we cannot say whether, had the speedy trial claim been\n\nlitigated  fully, it likely  would (or would  not) have  led to a\n\ndismissal  of the  indictment.   See  supra  Part II(B).    Thus,\n                                           \n\n                                11\n\nbecause the record does not furnish proper illumination to enable\n\nus  to  assess  probable   outcomes,  the  issue  of  ineffective\n\nassistance is prematurely before us.\n\n          When faced with similar situations in comparable cases,\n\nwe  have routinely dismissed  the relevant portion  of the appeal\n\nwithout  prejudice  to  the  defendant's right  to  litigate  his\n\nineffective assistance claim through the medium of an application\n\nfor  post-conviction relief.  See,  e.g., McGill, 952  F.2d at 19\n                                                \n\nn.5  (dismissing assignment  of  error without  prejudice to  the\n\nfiling  of a  petition in  the district  court under 28  U.S.C.  \n\n2255); Hunnewell, 891  F.2d at 956  n.1 (same).   We follow  this\n                \n\nsound practice today   but with an added wrinkle.\n\n          Three things coalesce  here:  (1) appellant has shown a\n\nfair  likelihood of  success  on the  constitutional claim,6  (2)\n\nthat claim  is factually complex  and legally intricate,  and (3)\n\nthe  facts  are largely  undeveloped and  appellant (who  is both\n\nincarcerated and indigent) is severely hampered in his ability to\n\ninvestigate  them.  This seems, therefore, to be the rare section\n\n2255  case  in which  the     appointment     of     counsel   is\n\nwarranted.     See    18 U.S.C.      3006A(a)(2)(B)  (1993 Supp.)\n                  \n\n(stipulating  that,  if \"the  interests  of  justice so  require,\n\nrepresentation may  be provided [under the  Criminal Justice Act]\n\nfor any financially  eligible person who . .  . is seeking relief\n\n                    \n\n     6Our  belief that there is some likelihood of success is not\na finding, but merely an acknowledgment that appellant has limned\na colorable claim.

We affirm, without prejudice, however, to Mala's right to explore certain contentions in a more appropriate forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 4, 1989, a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico indicted Mala.   The grand jury twice revised the bill, a process that culminated in a five-count superseding indictment against a total of fourteen defendants.   Three counts targeted appellant, charging him with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 963 (1988), conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (1988), and using a telephone to facilitate importation of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 843(b) (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the named defendants were promptly arrested and tried.   Some were convicted,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> some were not.   Withal, the government exhibited seeming indifference toward appellant.   It was not until February 22, 1991--some 25 months after the original indictment surfaced--that government agents arrested him in St. Thomas, took him to Puerto Rico, and arraigned him on March 8, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that point forward, matters progressed at a more celeritous clip.   On April 22, 1991, Mala filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, or in the alternative, to suppress certain evidence.   The district court denied the motion on May 17.   Four days later, Mala filed a notice of appeal contesting the denial of his prayer for suppression.   Undeterred by the appeal, the district court ordered the trial to commence on May 23, 1991, as previously scheduled.   On May 30, a jury found appellant guilty on all three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two potentially significant events occurred between the date of the verdict and the imposition of sentence.   Some six weeks after the trial ended, this court dismissed the interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction after determining that the order refusing to suppress evidence was not immediately appealable.   In roughly the same time frame, appellant filed a pro se motion alleging, among other things, that he had been victimized by ineffective counsel.   The district judge denied this initiative on procedural grounds, ruling that such a motion could not be brought in advance of sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1991, the court sentenced appellant to a lengthy prison term and imposed other penalties.   This appeal followed.   In it, appellant is represented by successor counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>The Trial Court's Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to persuade us that his conviction is a nullity because the district court lacked authority over the case at time of trial.   The linchpin of this asseveration is appellant's insistence that a case cannot be pending in two courts at the same time;  hence, the pendency of his appeal from the refusal to suppress had the double-barrelled effect of transferring the case to the appellate court and stripping the trial court of jurisdiction.   We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, docketing a notice of appeal ousts a district court of jurisdiction over the underlying case.   See, e.g., Coastal Corp. v. Texas Eastern Corp., 869 F.2d 817, 819 (5th Cir.1989).   There is, however, an important difference between interlocutory appeals not specifically authorized by statute and other, less problematic appeals.   While an appeal from either a final order or an interlocutory order made immediately appealable by statute divests a district court of authority to proceed with respect to any matter touching upon, or involved in, the appeal, see 9 James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 203.11, at 3-45 (2d ed. 1993), an interlocutory appeal that is brought without any colorable jurisdictional basis does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction over the underlying case.   See United States v. Ferris, 751 F.2d 436, 440 (1st Cir.1984);  Hodgson v. Mahoney, 460 F.2d 326, 328 (1st Cir.1972);  see also 9 Moore's Federal Practice, supra, p 203.11, at 3-52.   Thus, when a litigant purposes to appeal a plainly unappealable order, the trial court may treat the appeal for what it is--a sham--and continue to exercise jurisdiction over the case.   Were the rule otherwise, a litigant bent on vexation could temporarily divest a trial court of jurisdiction at whim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case aptly illustrates the point.   Two days before his trial was scheduled to start, appellant \"appealed\" an interlocutory order that had been entered a few days earlier.   He did not identify then, nor has he identified now, any jurisdictional hook on which his appeal arguably might hang.   A transparently invalid appeal constitutes no appeal at all.   Because Mala's appeal was of this sorry stripe, the district court retained the authority to try the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>The Right to a Speedy Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the charges against him should have been dismissed because of unpardonable delays in the proceedings.   This contention must rise or fall on appellant's claim that too long a period of time intervened between his indictment and his arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This claim, in turn, implicates the Sixth Amendment, for the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161-3174 (1988), is not applicable to periods of delay antedating a defendant's arrest.   See United States v.  Zandi, 769 F.2d 229, 233 (4th Cir.1985);   United States v. Haiges, 688 F.2d 1273, 1274 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment provides in pertinent part that \"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy ... trial.\"   U.S. Const., Amend.  VI.  This right attaches upon indictment or arrest, whichever first occurs.   See United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 6-7, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 1500-02, 71 L.Ed.2d 696 (1981);  Dillingham v. United States, 423 U.S. 64, 64-65, 96 S.Ct. 303, 303-04, 46 L.Ed.2d 205 (1975) (per curiam).   The constitutional assurance serves many laudable purposes, chief of which is to limit the possibility that memories will fade, witnesses disappear, and needless delay impair an accused's ability to defend himself.   See United States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. 116, 120, 86 S.Ct. 773, 776, 15 L.Ed.2d 627 (1966).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), the Supreme Court established a four-part balancing test to be used in determining whether a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial has been abridged.   These four factors are (1) the length of the delay;  (2) the reasons for the delay;  (3) the defendant's posture vis-a-vis the delay, especially in respect to assertions of the speedy trial right;  and (4) the prejudice stemming from the delay.  Id. at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192.   These factors cannot be plugged into a formula that operates with scientific precision.   Rather, they must be considered on a case-by-case basis \"together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to apply the Barker test in the circumstances at bar frustrates meaningful appellate review.   The devoir of persuasion rests with the appellant to show error in the ruling below.   Although he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, he did not accompany it with affidavits or other materials of evidentiary quality.   What is more, he did not request an evidentiary hearing.   In the end, the district court denied the motion without holding a hearing and without making specific findings.   The briefs on appeal evince that the facts relevant to the second, third, and fourth furculae of the Barker test are hotly disputed.   We have no reliable way of resolving these factual disputes in the rarified atmosphere of an appellate bench.   It follows inexorably that appellant cannot carry his burden of demonstrating error in the ruling below:  without better factual insights, we can neither shrug off the possible existence of a scenario completely supportive of the district court's ruling nor measure the relative probabilities as among competing scenarios.   Consequently, Mala's assignment of error cannot prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To illustrate our dilemma, it might well be, as the government suggests, that appellant eluded arrest;  or, knowing about the indictment, failed to assert his speedy trial right for a protracted period of time;  or, having had the good fortune to observe a dress rehearsal of the government's case, suffered no cognizable prejudice through the delay.   If an evidentiary hearing shows any such scenario to be true--and we do not suggest that this will (or will not) prove to be the case--the facts might well defeat appellant's speedy trial claim, notwithstanding the extremely long period of pre-arraignment delay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See, e.g., Doggett v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 2691, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992);  United States v. Brock, 782 F.2d 1442, 1447 (7th Cir.1986).   On this inscrutable record, we simply cannot tell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it unbefitting to decide the point based on a burden-of-proof rule where, as here, appellant can fairly be held accountable for the opacity of the record.   Under federal motion practice, no automatic entitlement to an evidentiary hearing exists.   See Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d 1115, 1120 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that pretrial motions \"do not usually culminate in evidentiary hearings\").   Thus, a litigant who believes that evidence should be taken in order to put a motion into proper perspective must, at the very least, call the need for a hearing to the court's attention and ask that a hearing be convened.   A party who fails to meet this precondition cannot then complain that the court did not hold a hearing that it was never asked to hold.   See United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1286 (1st Cir.1992);  Teamsters, Etc., Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 20 n. 4 (1st Cir.1992).   District judges are not expected to be mind readers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, \"[d]ue process does not entitle the defendant to an evidentiary hearing where the defendant has failed to request one.\"  Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1286;  accord United States v. Rigby, 896 F.2d 392, 395 (9th Cir.1990).   Because an evidentiary hearing was neither sought nor convened in this instance, the assignment of error premised on the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial succumbs for want of satisfactory proof.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Ineffective Assistance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment also provides that persons accused of crimes shall receive the benefit of counsel for their defense.   See U.S. Const., Amend.  VI.  Appellant maintains that he was denied this safeguard because his trial counsel performed below any acceptable standard of proficiency.   While this suggestion is not implausible on its face, we do not think it is ripe for our consideration.   We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 986, 117 L.Ed.2d 148 (1992);  United States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v. Costa, 890 F.2d 480, 482-83 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v. Hoyos-Medina, 878 F.2d 21, 22 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v. Carter, 815 F.2d 827, 829 (1st Cir.1987);  United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir.1983).   The rule has a prudential aspect.   Since claims of ineffective assistance involve a binary analysis--the defendant must show, first, that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)--such claims typically require the resolution of factual issues that cannot efficaciously be addressed in the first instance by an appellate tribunal.   See Costa, 890 F.2d at 483;  Hoyos-Medina, 878 F.2d at 22.   In addition, the trial judge, by reason of his familiarity with the case, is usually in the best position to assess both the quality of the legal representation afforded to the defendant in the district court and the impact of any shortfall in that representation.   Under ideal circumstances, the court of appeals should have the benefit of this evaluation;  elsewise, the court, in effect, may be playing blindman's buff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we have occasionally undertaken review of ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal, even without the advantage of the district court's views.   See, e.g., Natanel, 938 F.2d at 309.   But we travel this route only when the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the claim.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellant invokes the exception on the theory that any lawyer worth his salt would have requested an evidentiary hearing, we think this case falls well within the compass of the usual rule.   Even if we assume arguendo that trial counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient, appellant's thesis runs afoul of the second prong of the Strickland test.   Under that prong, a criminal defendant must \"show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.   On the sparse record presently compiled, we cannot say whether, had the speedy trial claim been litigated fully, it likely would (or would not) have led to a dismissal of the indictment.   See supra Part II(B).   Thus, because the record does not furnish proper illumination to enable us to assess probable outcomes, the issue of ineffective assistance is prematurely before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When faced with similar situations in comparable cases, we have routinely dismissed the relevant portion of the appeal without prejudice to the defendant's right to litigate his ineffective assistance claim through the medium of an application for post-conviction relief.   See, e.g., McGill, 952 F.2d at 19 n. 5 (dismissing assignment of error without prejudice to the filing of a petition in the district court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255);  Hunnewell, 891 F.2d at 956 n. 1 (same).   We follow this sound practice today--but with an added wrinkle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three things coalesce here:  (1) appellant has shown a fair likelihood of success on the constitutional claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> (2) that claim is factually complex and legally intricate, and (3) the facts are largely undeveloped and appellant (who is both incarcerated and indigent) is severely hampered in his ability to investigate them.   This seems, therefore, to be the rare section 2255 case in which the appointment of counsel is warranted.   See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(a)(2)(B) (1993 Supp.)  (stipulating that, if \"the interests of justice so require, representation may be provided [under the Criminal Justice Act] for any financially eligible person who ... is seeking relief under section ... 2255 of title 28\");  see also Battle v. Armontrout, 902 F.2d 701, 702 (8th Cir.1990) (holding that the district court abused its discretion in failing to appoint counsel for habeas corpus petitioner);  Richardson v. Miller, 721 F.Supp. 1087 (W.D.Mo.1989) (finding, on particular facts, that the interests of justice dictated appointment of counsel in a &#167; 2255 case).   We thus direct the district court, if appellant petitions for section 2255 relief and demonstrates continued financial eligibility, to appoint counsel for him under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(a)(2)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   We affirm the judgment below, without prejudice, however, to appellant's right to raise his claim of ineffective assistance in a proceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.   As stipulated herein, the district court shall, subject to the strictures of the Criminal Justice Act, appoint counsel for appellant should such a proceeding eventuate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We affirmed the convictions.   See United States v. Valencia Lucena, 925 F.2d 506 (1st Cir.1991).   Although the facts surrounding appellant's alleged crimes are, for the most part, unimportant to the disposition of this appeal, the factual predicate of his case is substantially the same as that undergirding the other defendants' convictions.   Accordingly, we refer the reader who thirsts for additional detail to our earlier opinion.   See id. at 509-10, 512-13</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Appellant also asserts that the 75-day delay between March 8 and May 23 violated the statutory requirement that trial commence within 70 days following arraignment.   See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1) (1988).   This assertion need not detain us.   Delay \"resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion,\" is excludable for purposes of determining compliance vel non with the statutory mandate.   Id. at &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F).   Since appellant filed several pretrial motions, including the April 22 motion (which was not disposed of until May 17, see supra Part I), the thrust of his Speedy Trial Act claim misses the mark</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although a 25-month period of delay is \"presumptively prejudicial,\" Barker, 407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192, it is nevertheless essential to inquire into the remaining components of the test.   The length of the delay is merely \"a triggering mechanism,\" id., and courts frequently have found presumptively prejudicial periods of delay to be fully justified after examining the complete set of Barker factors.   See, e.g., Robinson v. Whitley, 2 F.3d 562, 569 (5th Cir.1993);  United States v. Aquirre, 994 F.2d 1454, 1457 (9th Cir.1993);  United States v. Colombo, 852 F.2d 19, 26 (1st Cir.1988);  Flowers v.

We affirm, without prejudice, however, to Mala's right to explore certain contentions in a more appropriate forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 4, 1989, a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico indicted Mala.   The grand jury twice revised the bill, a process that culminated in a five-count superseding indictment against a total of fourteen defendants.   Three counts targeted appellant, charging him with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 963 (1988), conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (1988), and using a telephone to facilitate importation of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 843(b) (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the named defendants were promptly arrested and tried.   Some were convicted,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> some were not.   Withal, the government exhibited seeming indifference toward appellant.   It was not until February 22, 1991--some 25 months after the original indictment surfaced--that government agents arrested him in St. Thomas, took him to Puerto Rico, and arraigned him on March 8, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that point forward, matters progressed at a more celeritous clip.   On April 22, 1991, Mala filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, or in the alternative, to suppress certain evidence.   The district court denied the motion on May 17.   Four days later, Mala filed a notice of appeal contesting the denial of his prayer for suppression.   Undeterred by the appeal, the district court ordered the trial to commence on May 23, 1991, as previously scheduled.   On May 30, a jury found appellant guilty on all three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two potentially significant events occurred between the date of the verdict and the imposition of sentence.   Some six weeks after the trial ended, this court dismissed the interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction after determining that the order refusing to suppress evidence was not immediately appealable.   In roughly the same time frame, appellant filed a pro se motion alleging, among other things, that he had been victimized by ineffective counsel.   The district judge denied this initiative on procedural grounds, ruling that such a motion could not be brought in advance of sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1991, the court sentenced appellant to a lengthy prison term and imposed other penalties.   This appeal followed.   In it, appellant is represented by successor counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>The Trial Court's Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to persuade us that his conviction is a nullity because the district court lacked authority over the case at time of trial.   The linchpin of this asseveration is appellant's insistence that a case cannot be pending in two courts at the same time;  hence, the pendency of his appeal from the refusal to suppress had the double-barrelled effect of transferring the case to the appellate court and stripping the trial court of jurisdiction.   We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, docketing a notice of appeal ousts a district court of jurisdiction over the underlying case.   See, e.g., Coastal Corp. v. Texas Eastern Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519519\"><a href=\"/opinion/519519/the-coastal-corporation-a-delaware-corporation-and-colorado-interstate/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 819 (5th Cir.1989).   There is, however, an important difference between interlocutory appeals not specifically authorized by statute and other, less problematic appeals.   While an appeal from either a final order or an interlocutory order made immediately appealable by statute divests a district court of authority to proceed with respect to any matter touching upon, or involved in, the appeal, see 9 James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 203.11, at 3-45 (2d ed. 1993), an interlocutory appeal that is brought without any colorable jurisdictional basis does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction over the underlying case.   See United States v. Ferris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446335\"><a href=\"/opinion/446335/united-states-v-donald-f-ferris/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 440 (1st Cir.1984);  Hodgson v. Mahoney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"303501\"><a href=\"/opinion/303501/james-d-hodgson-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, 328 (1st Cir.1972);  see also 9 Moore's Federal Practice, supra, p 203.11, at 3-52.   Thus, when a litigant purposes to appeal a plainly unappealable order, the trial court may treat the appeal for what it is--a sham--and continue to exercise jurisdiction over the case.   Were the rule otherwise, a litigant bent on vexation could temporarily divest a trial court of jurisdiction at whim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case aptly illustrates the point.   Two days before his trial was scheduled to start, appellant \"appealed\" an interlocutory order that had been entered a few days earlier.   He did not identify then, nor has he identified now, any jurisdictional hook on which his appeal arguably might hang.   A transparently invalid appeal constitutes no appeal at all.   Because Mala's appeal was of this sorry stripe, the district court retained the authority to try the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>The Right to a Speedy Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the charges against him should have been dismissed because of unpardonable delays in the proceedings.   This contention must rise or fall on appellant's claim that too long a period of time intervened between his indictment and his arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This claim, in turn, implicates the Sixth Amendment, for the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161-3174 (1988), is not applicable to periods of delay antedating a defendant's arrest.

The devoir of persuasion rests with the appellant to show error in the ruling below.   Although he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, he did not accompany it with affidavits or other materials of evidentiary quality.   What is more, he did not request an evidentiary hearing.   In the end, the district court denied the motion without holding a hearing and without making specific findings.   The briefs on appeal evince that the facts relevant to the second, third, and fourth furculae of the Barker test are hotly disputed.   We have no reliable way of resolving these factual disputes in the rarified atmosphere of an appellate bench.   It follows inexorably that appellant cannot carry his burden of demonstrating error in the ruling below:  without better factual insights, we can neither shrug off the possible existence of a scenario completely supportive of the district court's ruling nor measure the relative probabilities as among competing scenarios.   Consequently, Mala's assignment of error cannot prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To illustrate our dilemma, it might well be, as the government suggests, that appellant eluded arrest;  or, knowing about the indictment, failed to assert his speedy trial right for a protracted period of time;  or, having had the good fortune to observe a dress rehearsal of the government's case, suffered no cognizable prejudice through the delay.   If an evidentiary hearing shows any such scenario to be true--and we do not suggest that this will (or will not) prove to be the case--the facts might well defeat appellant's speedy trial claim, notwithstanding the extremely long period of pre-arraignment delay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See, e.g., Doggett v.

Thus, a litigant who believes that evidence should be taken in order to put a motion into proper perspective must, at the very least, call the need for a hearing to the court's attention and ask that a hearing be convened.

The rule has a prudential aspect.   Since claims of ineffective assistance involve a binary analysis--the defendant must show, first, that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense, see Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In addition, the trial judge, by reason of his familiarity with the case, is usually in the best position to assess both the quality of the legal representation afforded to the defendant in the district court and the impact of any shortfall in that representation.   Under ideal circumstances, the court of appeals should have the benefit of this evaluation;  elsewise, the court, in effect, may be playing blindman's buff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we have occasionally undertaken review of ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal, even without the advantage of the district court's views.   See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Natanel,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>.

Even if we assume arguendo that trial counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient, appellant's thesis runs afoul of the second prong of the Strickland test.   Under that prong, a criminal defendant must \"show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Strickland,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span>, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.   On the sparse record presently compiled, we cannot say whether, had the speedy trial claim been litigated fully, it likely would (or would not) have led to a dismissal of the indictment.   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> supra </span>Part II(B).

Counsel also asked us to consider appointing an attorney to represent Mala in such an endeavor and volunteered so to serve.   The selection of appointed counsel is a matter best left to the court in which such counsel is to appear and, accordingly, we defer to the district court in this regard</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
