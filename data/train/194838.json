In   companion  cases,\n                                     \n\nappellants, Edward Benjamin, M.D.  and Peter Embriano, M.D., sued\n\nappellee   Allen   Grosnick    for   deceit,   fraud,   negligent\n\nmisrepresentation,  breach of fiduciary  duty, and  violations of\n\nstate and federal securities law.   The district court  dismissed\n\nthe claims on the ground that appellants failed to properly serve\n\npleadings upon  appellee within  the required one  hundred twenty\n\ndays of filing  suit.   We affirm the  district court's  judgment\n\nwith respect to Benjamin and reverse it with respect to Embriano.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Appellants   filed   complaints  against   appellee  on\n\nSeptember 14,  1990.   Twelve  days  later,  Deputy Sheriff  Paul\n\nBianconi executed returns of  service swearing that he personally\n\nserved appellee at 167  Dwight Street, Longmeadow,  Massachusetts\n\nwith  both sets  of  pleadings.   After  procuring an  extension,\n\nappellee answered  alleging improper  service of process  in both\n\ncases and insufficient process  in Benjamin's case.  On  the same\n\nday,  appellee  also filed  a  third  party complaint  and  began\n\ndiscovery.  Six weeks  later, the court approved an  agreement by\n\nthe parties  to stay  the proceedings  for reasons  irrelevant to\n\nthis appeal.\n\n          Eventually, the stay ended, and a scheduling conference\n\nwas  held  at  which  appellee   made  a  vague  assertion   that\n\nappellants' service failed to  comply with Rule 4 of  the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure.1   At that time, he also asserted  that\n\n                    \n\n1  See appendix for the text of Rule 4.\n\n                               -3-\n\nprocess was insufficient in Benjamin's case because he was served\n\nwith the wrong complaint.2\n\n          On  April  30,  1992,  appellee moved  to  dismiss  the\n\nactions  pursuant  to Rule  4(j) of  the  Federal Rules  of Civil\n\nProcedure for  untimely  service.   In  support of  the  motions,\n\nappellee submitted an affidavit  claiming that, while the returns\n\nof  service  indicated  that   personal  service  took  place  in\n\nMassachusetts, he was not in Massachusetts on the alleged date of\n\nservice.  At this point, it  became clear that this was the basis\n\nof  the insufficient  service  defenses.   In addition,  appellee\n\nreiterated  in the affidavit that  even if the  method of service\n\nsufficed,  the  process itself  did  not  because Benjamin  never\n\nserved him with  the proper complaint.  In opposition, appellants\n\nsubmitted  affidavits by the  deputy sheriff stating  that he had\n\npersonally served appellee on  the record date.  Appellants  then\n\nre-served appellee properly.\n\n          After an evidentiary hearing, the  district court found\n\nthat  appellee was  in  Arizona on  the  service date,  and  that\n\nappellants therefore  failed to  personally serve him  within the\n\n120 day limit.  Then, finding that appellants failed to show good\n\n                    \ncause for  the delayed service,  the court  dismissed the  action\n2   Appellee contends that  while the summons  properly cited the\nwithout  prejudice.3    The  district  court  denied  appellants'\nappropriate case names, the  complaint that the sheriff delivered\nfor Benjamin  regarded an action  by Benjamin against  Richard K.\nBernstein and  The  Bernstein Group,  Inc. in  the United  States\nDistrict  Court  for the  District  of Connecticut.    While that\nlawsuit  concerned  similar  interests,  the complaint  for  that\naction did not name appellee as a defendant.\n\n3  Although the court dismissed the claims without prejudice, the\nstatute of  limitations bars the refiling  of appellants' federal\nstatutory claims.\n\n                               -4-\n\nrequest for reconsideration, and appellants filed this appeal.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Under Fed. R.  Civ. P.  4(j), if a  plaintiff fails  to\n\nproperly serve a named  defendant within 120 days after  filing a\n\ncomplaint, he must show \"good cause why such service was not made\n\nwithin that period\"  or face  dismissal.4  We  review a  district\n\ncourt's  determination of  whether a  plaintiff  established good\n\ncause only for  abuse of discretion.  United States  v. Ayer, 857\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 881, 884-85 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          With  respect  to   appellants'  alleged   insufficient\n\nservice,  we find  the  district court's  dismissal  an abuse  of\n       \n\ndiscretion.  Appellants did not purposely delay personal service.\n\nIndeed, they  completed  all  of the  steps  within  their  power\n\nnecessary  to effectuate such service.   The blame  for the error\n\nrested  with the deputy sheriff.  Moreover, because of the deputy\n\nsheriff's  sworn  representations  in   the  return  of  service,\n\nappellants reasonably believed  that they  had personally  served\n\nappellees.  \n\n          Furthermore, although appellee's answers to appellants'\n\ncomplaints alleged  insufficient  service, appellee  waited  more\n\n                    \n\n4  Rule 4(j) provides in relevant part:\n\n            If a  service of the summons  is not made\n            upon  a defendant  within 120  days after\n            the filing of the complaint and the party\n            on whose behalf such service was required\n            cannot show good  cause why such  service\n            was  not  made  within that  period,  the\n            action  shall  be  dismissed  as  to that\n            defendant without prejudice . . . .\n\n                               -5-\n\nthan  120  days to  notify  appellants of  the  defect's specific\n\nnature.  Given the general  nature of appellee's asserted defense\n\nand  the deputy sheriff's assurance in the return of service that\n\nhe   had  personally   served  appellee,   appellants  reasonably\n\nabstained from further investigation.\n\n          Still  further, the defective service did not prejudice\n\nappellee.   See Ayer, 857  F.2d at 881  (considering prejudice to\n                    \n\ndefendant  in  Rule 4(j)  determination).    Appellee had  actual\n\nnotice of the lawsuit  and secured through stipulation additional\n\ntime to file an answer.  Conversely,  dismissal  will   prejudice\n\nappellants because the statute of  limitations has already run on\n\ntheir  federal statutory claims.  See Floyd v. United States, 900\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1045,  1046  (7th  Cir.  1990)  (considering  prejudice  to\n\nplaintiff in Rule 4(j) determination).\n\n          Given  all  of  the  above factors,  we  conclude  that\n\nappellants showed  good cause  for the delayed  personal service.\n\nIn  its finding to  the contrary, the  district court erroneously\n\nrelied  on Roque  v. United  States, 857  F.2d  20, 22  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1988),5 which held that:\n\n            [G]iven  the  [defendant's] answer  which\n                                                     \n            did   not  clearly   allege  insufficient\n                                                     \n            service  of   process,  the  government's\n                                 \n            failure  plainly to  assert insufficiency\n            until  after the  120 days  had run,  the\n            confusion caused by the  district court's\n\n                    \n\n5  Although a  district court's good cause finding is entitled to\ngreat deference, such a finding \"'predicated upon, or induced by,\na misapprehension of law  is robbed of its  customary vitality.'\"\nReliance  Steel Products v. National Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575,\n                                                  \n577 (1st  Cir.  1989) (quoting  RCI  Northeast Services  Div.  v.\n                                                             \nBoston Edison Co., 822 F.2d 199, 203 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n                 \n\n                               -6-\n\n            initial   denial   of  the   government's\n            motion,  the simple  manner in  which the\n            service deficiency can be cured,  and the\n            absence of any  articulable prejudice  to\n            the  [defendant],  we think  the district\n            court should have found good cause.\n\n(emphasis added).  By implication,  the district court found that\n\nwhere a defendant clearly alleges insufficient service within the\n\n120  day limit, the  plaintiff is on  notice of some  defect, and\n\ntherefore must inquire into  the nature of that defect.  We agree\n\nwith  the district  court that  under certain  circumstances, the\n\nassertion  in an answer  of insufficient service  of process will\n\nprovide  notice  that  would  induce a  reasonable  plaintiff  to\n\ninvestigate the possibility of a deficiency.   In addition, there\n\nis  no requirement  that a  defendant specify  the source  of the\n\ndefect in the  service.   However, the lack  of such  specificity\n\nbears on the reasonableness  of the plaintiff's actions.   In the\n\npresent case, Grosnick did  not specify the source of  the defect\n\nuntil it was  too late for appellants to cure it.  Where as here,\n\nappellants,  relying on an attested  to return of  service by the\n\ndeputy sheriff, believed that they had properly effected service,\n\nand indeed did everything in their power to do so, Roque does not\n                                                        \n\nimply that failure  to investigate after  a general assertion  of\n\ninsufficient  service  prevents a  finding  of  good  cause.   We\n\ntherefore   reverse  the   court's   judgment  with   respect  to\n\nappellants' delay of personal service.\n\n          On the other hand,  we cannot easily forgive Benjamin's\n\nalleged service  of insufficient process.   Although the district\n                                        \n\ncourt requested  a statement  of contested facts,  Benjamin never\n\n                               -7-\n\ndisputed appellee's allegation that he was served with the  wrong\n\ncomplaint.    Indeed,  although appellee  mentioned  the  problem\n\nnumerous times on the  record, and again on appeal,  Benjamin has\n\nyet  to acknowledge it.  Accordingly, we accept the allegation as\n\ntrue.\n\n          Also because of  Benjamin's failure to  acknowledge the\n\nallegation,  we  cannot possibly  conclude  that he  has  met his\n\nburden of  establishing  good cause  why  service of  the  proper\n\ncomplaint  was  delayed.   We  do not  know  with whom  the error\n\noriginated, when  Benjamin knew  about  it, or  even whether  the\n\ndeficiency  was intentional.  By ignoring these major gaps in the\n\nprocedural history, and indeed  the entire issue, Benjamin failed\n\nto establish  good cause  for the  delayed service of  sufficient\n\nprocess.   Thus,  we affirm  the  district court's  dismissal  of\n\nBenjamin's case on different grounds than the court stated.\n\n          Affirmed in part; reversed in part.\n                                            \n\n          Appendix can be found attached to the slip opinion.\n\n                               -8-\n",

Twelve  days  later,  Deputy Sheriff  Paul\n\nBianconi executed returns of  service swearing that he personally\n\nserved appellee at 167  Dwight Street, Longmeadow,  Massachusetts\n\nwith  both sets  of  pleadings.   After  procuring an  extension,\n\nappellee answered  alleging improper  service of process  in both\n\ncases and insufficient process  in Benjamin's case.  On  the same\n\nday,  appellee  also filed  a  third  party complaint  and  began\n\ndiscovery.  Six weeks  later, the court approved an  agreement by\n\nthe parties  to stay  the proceedings  for reasons  irrelevant to\n\nthis appeal.\n\n          Eventually, the stay ended, and a scheduling conference\n\nwas  held  at  which  appellee   made  a  vague  assertion   that\n\nappellants' service failed to  comply with Rule 4 of  the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure.1   At that time, he also asserted  that\n\n                    \n\n1  See appendix for the text of Rule 4.\n\n                               -3-\n\nprocess was insufficient in Benjamin's case because he was served\n\nwith the wrong complaint.2\n\n          On  April  30,  1992,  appellee moved  to  dismiss  the\n\nactions  pursuant  to Rule  4(j) of  the  Federal Rules  of Civil\n\nProcedure for  untimely  service.   In  support of  the  motions,\n\nappellee submitted an affidavit  claiming that, while the returns\n\nof  service  indicated  that   personal  service  took  place  in\n\nMassachusetts, he was not in Massachusetts on the alleged date of\n\nservice.  At this point, it  became clear that this was the basis\n\nof  the insufficient  service  defenses.   In addition,  appellee\n\nreiterated  in the affidavit that  even if the  method of service\n\nsufficed,  the  process itself  did  not  because Benjamin  never\n\nserved him with  the proper complaint.  In opposition, appellants\n\nsubmitted  affidavits by the  deputy sheriff stating  that he had\n\npersonally served appellee on  the record date.  Appellants  then\n\nre-served appellee properly.\n\n          After an evidentiary hearing, the  district court found\n\nthat  appellee was  in  Arizona on  the  service date,  and  that\n\nappellants therefore  failed to  personally serve him  within the\n\n120 day limit.  Then, finding that appellants failed to show good\n\n                    \ncause for  the delayed service,  the court  dismissed the  action\n2   Appellee contends that  while the summons  properly cited the\nwithout  prejudice.3    The  district  court  denied  appellants'\nappropriate case names, the  complaint that the sheriff delivered\nfor Benjamin  regarded an action  by Benjamin against  Richard K.\nBernstein and  The  Bernstein Group,  Inc. in  the United  States\nDistrict  Court  for the  District  of Connecticut.    While that\nlawsuit  concerned  similar  interests,  the complaint  for  that\naction did not name appellee as a defendant.\n\n3  Although the court dismissed the claims without prejudice, the\nstatute of  limitations bars the refiling  of appellants' federal\nstatutory claims.\n\n                               -4-\n\nrequest for reconsideration, and appellants filed this appeal.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Under Fed. R.  Civ. P.  4(j), if a  plaintiff fails  to\n\nproperly serve a named  defendant within 120 days after  filing a\n\ncomplaint, he must show \"good cause why such service was not made\n\nwithin that period\"  or face  dismissal.4  We  review a  district\n\ncourt's  determination of  whether a  plaintiff  established good\n\ncause only for  abuse of discretion.

Appellants did not purposely delay personal service.\n\nIndeed, they  completed  all  of the  steps  within  their  power\n\nnecessary  to effectuate such service.   The blame  for the error\n\nrested  with the deputy sheriff.  Moreover, because of the deputy\n\nsheriff's  sworn  representations  in   the  return  of  service,\n\nappellants reasonably believed  that they  had personally  served\n\nappellees.  \n\n          Furthermore, although appellee's answers to appellants'\n\ncomplaints alleged  insufficient  service, appellee  waited  more\n\n                    \n\n4  Rule 4(j) provides in relevant part:\n\n            If a  service of the summons  is not made\n            upon  a defendant  within 120  days after\n            the filing of the complaint and the party\n            on whose behalf such service was required\n            cannot show good  cause why such  service\n            was  not  made  within that  period,  the\n            action  shall  be  dismissed  as  to that\n            defendant without prejudice . . . .\n\n                               -5-\n\nthan  120  days to  notify  appellants of  the  defect's specific\n\nnature.  Given the general  nature of appellee's asserted defense\n\nand  the deputy sheriff's assurance in the return of service that\n\nhe   had  personally   served  appellee,   appellants  reasonably\n\nabstained from further investigation.\n\n          Still  further, the defective service did not prejudice\n\nappellee.

By implication,  the district court found that\n\nwhere a defendant clearly alleges insufficient service within the\n\n120  day limit, the  plaintiff is on  notice of some  defect, and\n\ntherefore must inquire into  the nature of that defect.  We agree\n\nwith  the district  court that  under certain  circumstances, the\n\nassertion  in an answer  of insufficient service  of process will\n\nprovide  notice  that  would  induce a  reasonable  plaintiff  to\n\ninvestigate the possibility of a deficiency.   In addition, there\n\nis  no requirement  that a  defendant specify  the source  of the\n\ndefect in the  service.   However, the lack  of such  specificity\n\nbears on the reasonableness  of the plaintiff's actions.   In the\n\npresent case, Grosnick did  not specify the source of  the defect\n\nuntil it was  too late for appellants to cure it.  Where as here,\n\nappellants,  relying on an attested  to return of  service by the\n\ndeputy sheriff, believed that they had properly effected service,\n\nand indeed did everything in their power to do so, Roque does not\n                                                        \n\nimply that failure  to investigate after  a general assertion  of\n\ninsufficient  service  prevents a  finding  of  good  cause.   We\n\ntherefore   reverse  the   court's   judgment  with   respect  to\n\nappellants' delay of personal service.\n\n          On the other hand,  we cannot easily forgive Benjamin's\n\nalleged service  of insufficient process.   Although the district\n                                        \n\ncourt requested  a statement  of contested facts,  Benjamin never\n\n                               -7-\n\ndisputed appellee's allegation that he was served with the  wrong\n\ncomplaint.    Indeed,  although appellee  mentioned  the  problem\n\nnumerous times on the  record, and again on appeal,  Benjamin has\n\nyet  to acknowledge it.  Accordingly, we accept the allegation as\n\ntrue.\n\n          Also because of  Benjamin's failure to  acknowledge the\n\nallegation,  we  cannot possibly  conclude  that he  has  met his\n\nburden of  establishing  good cause  why  service of  the  proper\n\ncomplaint  was  delayed.   We  do not  know  with whom  the error\n\noriginated, when  Benjamin knew  about  it, or  even whether  the\n\ndeficiency  was intentional.  By ignoring these major gaps in the\n\nprocedural history, and indeed  the entire issue, Benjamin failed\n\nto establish  good cause  for the  delayed service of  sufficient\n\nprocess.   Thus,  we affirm  the  district court's  dismissal  of\n\nBenjamin's case on different grounds than the court stated.\n\n          Affirmed in part; reversed in part.\n                                            \n\n          Appendix can be found attached to the slip opinion.\n\n                               -8-\n</pre>",
