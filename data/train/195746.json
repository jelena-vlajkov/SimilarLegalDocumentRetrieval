This is an appeal from the judgment of\r                                \n\nthe district court affirming the decision of the Secretary of\n\nHealth  and Human  Services  that  claimant,  Ramon  Cruzado-\n\nCrespo,  is  not  entitled   to  Social  Security  disability\n\nbenefits.   Claimant presents one issue for review -- whether\n\nthere is  substantial evidence to support  the calculation of\n\nthe date his insured status expired.\n\n          At claimant's hearing, the administrative law judge\n\n(ALJ) initially  stated that  claimant's  insured status  had\n\nexpired  on June 30, 1980.  The record of claimant's earnings\n\nsupports this position.   See Transcript at 199.   During the\r                                         \n\ncourse  of the hearing, however,  the ALJ decided to consider\n\nthe medical evidence through March 31, 1981  despite the lack\n\nof sufficient proof of coverage.  Claimant disagrees with the\n\nALJ  and asserts that the  correct cut-off date  is August 3,\n\n1983.\n\n          For this  proposition, claimant  does not refer  to\n\nthe record of his earnings.  Rather, he  relies on the notice\n\nof  hearing  he  received  concerning  the  second  of   four\n\napplications for disability benefits that he had filed.  This\n\napplication was  filed on July  30, 1982.  The  notice sets a\n\nhearing date  of August 3, 1983  and states:   \"You should be\n\nprepared  to prove  that you  were under  a disability  on or\n\nbefore\"  followed by a blank space for  a date.  The space is\n\nfilled in with the language \"Date of hearing.\"  See Trans. at\r                                                               \n\n145.   Similar  language appears  on the  notice sent  to the\n\nvocational expert  scheduled to testify at the  hearing.  See\r                                                                         \r\r\n\nTrans. at 143.  Because he was to prove that  he was disabled\n\n\"on or  before\" August  3, 1983, claimant  asserts that  this\n\nmust be the date he was last insured.\n\n          Although  claimant's reading  of  both  notices  is\n\nplainly plausible, the record as a whole does not support his\n\nposition.   First, we doubt  that such an  arguably erroneous\n\nreference  to the  insured-status period  could enlarge  this\n\nperiod as set  by the  official record of  earnings.  In  any\n\nevent, these notices, dated July 22, 1983, concern the second\n\napplication filed by claimant.  This  application was not the\n\none the Secretary considered  and, thus, is not before  us on\n\nreview.  As a result, claimant may not rely  on these notices\n\nto support his position.\n\n          Next, the notice of the hearing date concerning the\n\ncurrent application, see Trans.  at 375, states that claimant\r                                    \n\nshould be prepared  to prove  that he became  disabled on  or\n\nbefore June 30,  1980, the  date reflected in  the record  of\n\nclaimant's earnings.  The fact that the ALJ chose to consider\n\nevidence  through  March  1981  was  to  claimant's  benefit.\n\nFurther, the current notice is dated December 4, 1991 -- over\n\nseven years after  the notices upon which  claimant rests his\r                 \n\ncase.   Because there is nothing  else in the record  to back\n\nclaimant's   position,  we  conclude   that  the  Secretary's\n\ndecision is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          The  judgment  of the  district court  therefore is\n\naffirmed.\r                    \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
