Plaintiffs-appellants appeal the dismissal\n               \n\nof their action for  lack of diversity jurisdiction,  as well\n\nas the denial of  their motion for reconsideration.   For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     This  is a personal injury action arising out of a motor\n\nvehicle accident which occurred in Puerto Rico.   Plaintiffs-\n\nappellants are  a married  couple,  Robert Campbell  and  Lil\n\nIzquierdo,  and their  three children,  Robert, Jamilah,  and\n\nKirsa  Campbell  Izquierdo.    On  November  29,  1991,   Lil\n\nIzquierdo and the three children were travelling together  in\n\nan automobile when it collided with a motor vehicle driven by\n\nRosario Rosa Acevedo.  Lil Izquierdo was rendered unconscious\n\nby the accident and remained in a coma until January 6, 1992.\n\nOn November  30, 1992,  appellants brought  a lawsuit  in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of  Puerto Rico\n\nagainst  Rosario Rosa  Acevedo, Denton  Construction Company,\n\nIntegrand Assurance  Company,  and the  Puerto  Rico  Highway\n\nAuthority.   The amended complaint,  which invokes  diversity\n\njurisdiction under  28 U.S.C.   1332(a)(1),  alleges that all\n\nplaintiffs  are citizens of  New York and  all defendants are\n\ncitizens of Puerto Rico.  \n\n     On   January  28,  1994,  appellee  Denton  Construction\n\nCompany moved to dismiss the action, claiming that  diversity\n\njurisdiction  is  lacking  because  Lil  Izquierdo   and  the\n\nchildren were domiciled  in Puerto  Rico at the  time of  the\n\naccident.   Appellee supported  its  contentions with,  inter\n                                                             \n\nalia,  excerpts  from a  deposition  of  Lil Izquierdo  which\n    \n\nrevealed  that  she  had  been  living  in  Puerto  Rico  for\n\napproximately eleven years.  She and her husband had moved to\n\nPuerto  Rico from  New York  after the  birth of  their third\n\nchild, Kisra.   They voted and worked in Puerto  Rico.  After\n\nsome years, Robert Campbell moved back to New York because he\n\nwas able to  find a better job there.  Lil Izquierdo remained\n\nin Quebradillas, Puerto Rico with the children and  worked as\n\na school teacher.\n\n     In opposition, appellants pointed out  that the relevant\n\ndate for determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists is\n\nthe  time  of  filing  the  complaint.   See,  e.g.,  Valedon\n                                                             \n\nMartinez v. Hospital Presbiteriano  de la Comunidad, 806 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1128, 1132  (1st Cir. 1986).   Appellants contended  that Lil\n\nIzquierdo and the children had joined Robert Campbell in  New\n\nYork  in  January  1992,  and  that  the  entire  family  was\n\ndomiciled  there  at  the   time  the  complaint  was  filed.\n\nAlthough since  filing the  complaint, Lil Izquierdo  and the\n\nchildren had returned to  Quebradillas, and Lil Izquierdo had\n\nreturned  to  her  former   position  as  a  school  teacher,\n\nappellants  alleged  that  the  return  was  solely  for  the\n\npurposes of  furthering  Lil Izquierdo's  rehabilitation  and\n\nattending  to  the  lawsuit.     Appellants  supported  their\n\nallegations with  a sworn statement, dated  February 7, 1994,\n\nattesting  that Lil  Izquierdo and  her children  had changed\n\ntheir  \"residence\" to New York in January 1992 and planned to\n\nreturn  there  after   Lil  Izquierdo's  rehabilitation   was\n\n                             -3-\n\ncompleted.    Appellants  also  submitted excerpts  from  the\n\ndeposition of Lil Izquierdo in which she testified that after\n\nbecoming conscious and beginning her rehabilitation, she  had\n\nbeen  unable  to find  a  job in  the  United States  and had\n\nreturned to Puerto Rico because she needed the \"resource\" and\n\nher  former supervisor was willing to  let her work part-time\n\non a trial basis.  Although she and the children were  living\n\nin  their former home,  Lil Izquierdo  testified that  she no\n\nlonger owned it and that it was now \"under the bank's name.\"\n\n     On  April  5,  1994,   the  district  court  found  that\n\ndiversity is lacking, at least as to Lil Izquierdo, based, in\n\npart, on her deposition testimony which suggested that \"after\n\nthe accident  she was packed up and taken off to the States.\"\n\nThe court observed that at no point in the excerpts submitted\n\ndid Lil Izquierdo  express any  desire to make  New York  her\n\ndomicile, even after she  arrived.  The court also  noted the\n\nabsence of  \"any evidence traditionally  evaluated that could\n\nsupport  a change in domicile for any of the three plaintiffs\n\ndomiciled  in Puerto  Rico.\"   Judgment  dismissing the  case\n\nwithout prejudice was entered on April 8, 1994.    \n\n     On  April  20,  1994,  appellants  filed  a  motion  for\n\nreconsideration supported by a second  sworn statement, dated\n\nMay 2, 1994,  in which Lil Izquierdo  described her residence\n\nin New  York as \"true, fixed and permanent\" and her return to\n\nPuerto Rico as  \"temporary.\"  The  district court denied  the\n\n                             -4-\n\nmotion stating that the language and content of the statement\n\n\"are  too stilted and constructed  to be more  than a belated\n\nattempt to recreate a version of intent after the fact.\"  The\n\ncourt also stated:\n\n     If  it is  plaintiffs next  strategy  to physically\n     relocate  once  again to  New  York,  in a  belated\n     effort  to  once  again  prove  her  intent  to  be\n     domiciled there, we remind them that the moment for\n     consideration  was  the  first time  that  she  was\n     living   there.     All  other   considerations  of\n     domicile,  voter registration,  property ownership,\n     driver's license,  organizational ties, employment,\n     and  the like, as well as the ties cut upon leaving\n     Puerto Rico were never demonstrated.\n\nAppellants filed a timely notice of appeal from the dismissal\n\nand from the denial of their motion for reconsideration.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Federal  jurisdiction  under   28  U.S.C.     1332(a)(1)\n\nrequires  that  the   \"matter  in  controversy\"   be  between\n\n\"citizens of  different states.\"  For  purposes of diversity,\n\nstate  citizenship  is   ordinarily  equated  with  domicile.\n\nRodriguez-Diaz v.  Sierra-Martinez, 853 F.2d 1027,  1029 (1st\n                                  \n\nCir. 1988).   \"A person's domicile `is the place where he has\n\na true, fixed home and principal establishment, and to which,\n\nwhenever he is  absent he has  the intention of  returning.'\"\n\nId.  (quoting C. Wright, A.  Miller &amp; E.  Cooper, 13B Federal\n                                                             \n\nPractice &amp; Procedure    3612, at  526 (1984)).   In order  to\n                    \n\nchange domicile, a person  must (1) physically relocate  to a\n\nnew state; and  (2) intend  to remain there.   See Bank  One,\n                                                             \n\nTexas, N.A. v. Montle, 964 F.2d  48, 50 (1st Cir. 1992).  The\n                     \n\n                             -5-\n\ndetermination of domicile  is a  mixed question  of fact  and\n\nlaw, and a  district court's  finding will not  be set  aside\n\nunless clearly erroneous. Id. at 51.  \n                             \n\n     Appellants  contend  that the  district  court erred  in\n\nfinding that Lil Izquierdo never  changed her domicile to New\n\nYork.  We  disagree.  We note as an  initial matter that once\n\nchallenged, appellants  bore the  burden of  supporting their\n\nallegations  of  jurisdiction  with  competent  proof.    See\n                                                             \n\nO'Toole v. Arlington  Trust Co.,  681 F.2d 94,  98 (1st  Cir.\n                               \n\n1982).    Since  it  is  undisputed that  Lil  Izquierdo  was\n\nresiding in New  York at  the time the  complaint was  filed,\n\nappellants needed only  to prove that she  intended to remain\n\nthere.  Appellants, however, presented no evidence whatsoever\n\nbearing on the factors  traditionally relevant to determining\n\nsuch intent.1   For example,  there is no  evidence that  Lil\n\nIzquierdo,  who  voted in  Puerto  Rico,  changed her  voting\n\nregistration to New York.  See Lundquist  v. Precision Valley\n                                                             \n\nAviation, Inc., 946 F.2d  8, 12 (1st Cir. 1991)  (noting that\n              \n\n                    \n\n1.  These factors include:\n\n     the  place where  civil  and  political rights  are\n     exercised, taxes  paid, real and  personal property\n     (such  as  furniture   and  automobiles)   located,\n     driver's and other licenses obtained, bank accounts\n     maintained, location of  club and church membership\n     and places of business or employment.\n\nLundquist v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 946 F.2d 8, 11-\n                                            \n12 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (quoting 1 Moore's  Federal Practice,   \n                                                         \n0.74[3.-3], at 788 (2d ed. 1991)).\n\n                             -6-\n\nthe  place  a person  is registered  to  vote is  a \"weighty\"\n\nfactor  in determining  domicile).   Nor  is there  any other\n\nobjective  evidence   in  the  record   that  Lil   Izquierdo\n\nestablished political, civic, or  community ties to New York.\n\nMoreover, although appellants point out that Lil Izquierdo no\n\nlonger  owned  her  home  in  Quebradillas  by  the time  she\n\nreturned to Puerto Rico,  the deposition excerpts reveal that\n\nshe  was in  contact  with  the  bank  and  hoped  to  regain\n\nownership  by  making  the   necessary  payment.    Far  from\n\ndemonstrating that Lil Izquierdo had severed ties with Puerto\n\nRico, such evidence suggests that she continued to view it as\n\nher home.  \n\n     We add that the sworn statement dated February 7,  1994,\n\nattesting  to  Lil Izquierdo's  change  of  domicile and  her\n\nintent to return to  New York after further \"rehabilitation,\"\n\nwas  conclusory  and  also  conflicted  with Lil  Izquierdo's\n\ndeposition testimony that she  lived \"on a day by  day basis\"\n\nand that \"hopefully, something  positive will happen and I'll\n\nbe  able to pay for the house  [in Quebradillas].\"  Cf. Hawes\n                                                             \n\nv. Club Ecuestre El  Comandante, 598 F.2d 698, 704  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1979) (giving no weight to conclusory statements in affidavit\n\nas to intention).   Given  the paucity of  evidence that  Lil\n\nIzquierdo changed  her domicile to New  York, and conflicting\n\nevidence to  the contrary, we  cannot say  that the  district\n\ncourt committed clear error  in making the determination that\n\n                             -7-\n\nit  did.  See Lundquist,  946 F.2d at  13 (upholding district\n                       \n\ncourt's ruling on diversity where evidence  was conflicting);\n\nO'Toole,  681 F.2d  at  98 (holding  that  \"[t]he paucity  of\n       \n\nappellants' presentation of evidence justifie[d] the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that they had not met [their] burden.\").2\n\n     We also  reject appellants'  argument that  the district\n\ncourt  erred in not giving them an evidentiary hearing on the\n\njurisdictional  issue.   \"A  district  court  has very  broad\n\ndiscretion  in  determining  the  manner  in  which  it  will\n\nconsider the  issue of jurisdiction.\"   Valedon Martinez, 806\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 1132.  Here, appellants were given ample opportunity\n\nto  present the court with facts relevant to the existence of\n\njurisdiction.    Moreover,  appellants  did  not  request  an\n\nevidentiary  hearing  until  after the  case  was  dismissed.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in  deciding  the issue  on documentary  evidence.\n\nSee O'Toole, 681  F.2d at  98 (\"Any  failure on  the part  of\n           \n\nappellant  to fully  avail themselves  of the  opportunity to\n\npresent evidence to the  court should not now be  blamed upon\n\nthe court's choice not to require an evidentiary hearing.\").\n\n     Lastly, we consider the  denial of appellants' motion to\n\nreconsider.   In  this motion, which  failed to  identify the\n\n                    \n\n2.  In light  of our decision upholding  the district court's\ndetermination  that diversity is lacking \"at  least as to Lil\nIzquierdo,\" we  need not  consider whether diversity  is also\nlacking with respect to the three children.  \n\n                             -8-\n\napplicable   procedural  rule,  appellants  argued  that  the\n\ndistrict court overlooked the first sworn statement attesting\n\nto Lil Izquierdo's intent  to make New York her  domicile and\n\nreached  an erroneous legal conclusion.  Appellants supported\n\nthe  motion to  reconsider  with the  second sworn  statement\n\nwhich  made  additional  conclusory   statements  as  to  Lil\n\nIzquierdo's  intention.  It is plain from the record that the\n\ndistrict court carefully considered these sworn statements in\n\ndenying the  motion for  reconsideration.  Moreover,  for the\n\nreasons we have already articulated, we  cannot find that the\n\ndistrict court erred in reaching the legal conclusion it did.\n\nUnder the  circumstances, whether  we construe the  motion to\n\nreconsider as one under Federal Rule Civil Procedure 59(e) or\n\n60(b), we  find no abuse  of discretion  in its denial.   See\n                                                             \n\nKaercher v. Trustees of Health &amp; Hosps, Inc., 834 F.2d 31, 34\n                                            \n\n(1st  Cir. 1987) (denial of Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) motions\n\nsubject to abuse of discretion standard on appeal).3\n\n                    \n\n3.  Contrary to  the position taken by appellants, we are not\npersuaded that  the district court's statement,  in its order\ndenying the motion for  reconsideration, that \"the moment for\nconsideration  was the  first time  that [Lil  Izquierdo] was\nliving [in New  York],\" constitutes a ruling in  advance that\nappellants are  barred from refiling their  action in federal\ndistrict court.   We think that the  district court's remarks\nare  better  construed  as   a  reminder  that  diversity  is\ndetermined as of the  date an action is commenced  and cannot\nbe created by a change of domicile during the pendency of the\naction.  In any event,  we note that a dismissal for  want of\njurisdiction does  not preclude  a second action  where there\nare  subsequent  developments  that cure  the  jurisdictional\ndeficiency  in the first suit.  See, e.g., Costello v. United\n                                                             \nStates, 365  U.S. 265, 284-88 (1961)  (holding that dismissal\n      \n\n                             -9-\n\n     Affirmed.

For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a personal injury action arising out of a motor vehicle accident which occurred in Puerto Rico.  Plaintiffs- appellants are a married couple, Robert Campbell and Lil Izquierdo, and their three children, Robert, Jamilah, and Kirsa Campbell Izquierdo.  On November 29, 1991, Lil Izquierdo and the three children were travelling together in an automobile when it collided with a motor vehicle driven by Rosario Rosa Acevedo.  Lil Izquierdo was rendered unconscious by the accident and remained in a coma until January 6, 1992.  On November 30, 1992, appellants brought a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against Rosario Rosa Acevedo, Denton Construction Company, Integrand Assurance Company, and the Puerto Rico Highway Authority.  The amended complaint, which invokes diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332(a)(1), alleges that all plaintiffs are citizens of New York and all defendants are citizens of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 1994, appellee Denton Construction Company moved to dismiss the action, claiming that diversity jurisdiction is lacking because Lil Izquierdo and the children were domiciled in Puerto Rico at the time of the accident.  Appellee supported its contentions with, inter alia, excerpts from a deposition of Lil Izquierdo which revealed that she had been living in Puerto Rico for approximately eleven years.  She and her husband had moved to Puerto Rico from New York after the birth of their third child, Kisra.  They voted and worked in Puerto Rico.  After some years, Robert Campbell moved back to New York because he was able to find a better job there.  Lil Izquierdo remained in Quebradillas, Puerto Rico with the children and worked as a school teacher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In opposition, appellants pointed out that the relevant date for determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists is the time of filing the complaint.   See, e.g., Valedon Martinez v. Hospital Presbiteriano de la Comunidad, 806 F.2d 1128, 1132 (1st Cir. 1986).  Appellants contended that Lil Izquierdo and the children had joined Robert Campbell in New York in January 1992, and that the entire family was domiciled there at the time the complaint was filed.  Although since filing the complaint, Lil Izquierdo and the children had returned to Quebradillas, and Lil Izquierdo had returned to her former position as a school teacher, appellants alleged that the return was solely for the purposes of furthering Lil Izquierdo's rehabilitation and attending to the lawsuit.  Appellants supported their allegations with a sworn statement, dated February 7, 1994, attesting that Lil Izquierdo and her children had changed their \"residence\" to New York in January 1992 and planned to return there after Lil Izquierdo's rehabilitation was completed.  Appellants also submitted excerpts from the deposition of Lil Izquierdo in which she testified that after becoming conscious and beginning her rehabilitation, she had been unable to find a job in the United States and had returned to Puerto Rico because she needed the \"resource\" and her former supervisor was willing to let her work part-time on a trial basis.  Although she and the children were living in their former home, Lil Izquierdo testified that she no longer owned it and that it was now \"under the bank's name.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5, 1994, the district court found that diversity is lacking, at least as to Lil Izquierdo, based, in part, on her deposition testimony which suggested that \"after the accident she was packed up and taken off to the States.\"  The court observed that at no point in the excerpts submitted did Lil Izquierdo express any desire to make New York her domicile, even after she arrived.  The court also noted the absence of \"any evidence traditionally evaluated that could support a change in domicile for any of the three plaintiffs domiciled in Puerto Rico.\"  Judgment dismissing the case without prejudice was entered on April 8, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 20, 1994, appellants filed a motion for reconsideration supported by a second sworn statement, dated May 2, 1994, in which Lil Izquierdo described her residence in New York as \"true, fixed and permanent\" and her return to Puerto Rico as \"temporary.\"  The district court denied the motion stating that the language and content of the statement \"are too stilted and constructed to be more than a belated attempt to recreate a version of intent after the fact.\"  The court also stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>If it is plaintiffs next strategy to physically relocate once again to New York, in a belated effort to once again prove her intent to be domiciled there, we remind them that the moment for consideration was the first time that she was living there.  All other considerations of domicile, voter registration, property ownership, driver's license, organizational ties, employment, and the like, as well as the ties cut upon leaving Puerto Rico were never demonstrated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal from the dismissal and from the denial of their motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332(a)(1) requires that the \"matter in controversy\" be between \"citizens of different states.\"  For purposes of diversity, state citizenship is ordinarily equated with domicile.   Rodriguez- Diaz v. Sierra-Martinez, 853 F.2d 1027, 1029 (1st Cir. 1988).  \"A person's domicile 'is the place where he has a true, fixed home and principal establishment, and to which, whenever he is absent he has the intention of returning.' \"  Id. (quoting C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, 13B Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Sec. 3612, at 526 (1984)).  In order to change domicile, a person must (1) physically relocate to a new state;  and (2) intend to remain there.   See Bank One, Texas, N.A. v. Montle, 964 F.2d 48, 50 (1st Cir. 1992).  The determination of domicile is a mixed question of fact and law, and a district court's finding will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.   Id. at 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the district court erred in finding that Lil Izquierdo never changed her domicile to New York.  We disagree.  We note as an initial matter that once challenged, appellants bore the burden of supporting their allegations of jurisdiction with competent proof.   See O'Toole v. Arlington Trust Co., 681 F.2d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 1982).  Since it is undisputed that Lil Izquierdo was residing in New York at the time the complaint was filed, appellants needed only to prove that she intended to remain there.  Appellants, however, presented no evidence whatsoever bearing on the factors traditionally relevant to determining such intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  For example, there is no evidence that Lil Izquierdo, who voted in Puerto Rico, changed her voting registration to New York.   See Lundquist v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 946 F.2d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that the place a person is registered to vote is a \"weighty\" factor in determining domicile).  Nor is there any other objective evidence in the record that Lil Izquierdo established political, civic, or community ties to New York.  Moreover, although appellants point out that Lil Izquierdo no longer owned her home in Quebradillas by the time she returned to Puerto Rico, the deposition excerpts reveal that she was in contact with the bank and hoped to regain ownership by making the necessary payment.  Far from demonstrating that Lil Izquierdo had severed ties with Puerto Rico, such evidence suggests that she continued to view it as her home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that the sworn statement dated February 7, 1994, attesting to Lil Izquierdo's change of domicile and her intent to return to New York after further \"rehabilitation,\" was conclusory and also conflicted with Lil Izquierdo's deposition testimony that she lived \"on a day by day basis\" and that \"hopefully, something positive will happen and I'll be able to pay for the house [in Quebradillas].\"   Cf. Hawes v. Club Ecuestre El Comandante, 598 F.2d 698, 704 (1st Cir. 1979) (giving no weight to conclusory statements in affidavit as to intention).  Given the paucity of evidence that Lil Izquierdo changed her domicile to New York, and conflicting evidence to the contrary, we cannot say that the district court committed clear error in making the determination that it did.   See Lundquist, 946 F.2d at 13 (upholding district court's ruling on diversity where evidence was conflicting);  O'Toole, 681 F.2d at 98 (holding that \"[t]he paucity of appellants' presentation of evidence justifie[d] the district court's conclusion that they had not met [their] burden.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject appellants' argument that the district court erred in not giving them an evidentiary hearing on the jurisdictional issue.  \"A district court has very broad discretion in determining the manner in which it will consider the issue of jurisdiction.\"   Valedon Martinez, 806 F.2d at 1132.  Here, appellants were given ample opportunity to present the court with facts relevant to the existence of jurisdiction.  Moreover, appellants did not request an evidentiary hearing until after the case was dismissed.  Under the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding the issue on documentary evidence.   See O'Toole, 681 F.2d at 98 (\"Any failure on the part of appellant to fully avail themselves of the opportunity to present evidence to the court should not now be blamed upon the court's choice not to require an evidentiary hearing.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, we consider the denial of appellants' motion to reconsider.  In this motion, which failed to identify the applicable procedural rule, appellants argued that the district court overlooked the first sworn statement attesting to Lil Izquierdo's intent to make New York her domicile and reached an erroneous legal conclusion.  Appellants supported the motion to reconsider with the second sworn statement which made additional conclusory statements as to Lil Izquierdo's intention.  It is plain from the record that the district court carefully considered these sworn statements in denying the motion for reconsideration.  Moreover, for the reasons we have already articulated, we cannot find that the district court erred in reaching the legal conclusion it did.  Under the circumstances, whether we construe the motion to reconsider as one under Federal Rule Civil Procedure 59(e) or 60(b), we find no abuse of discretion in its denial.   See Kaercher v. Trustees of Health &amp; Hosps, Inc., 834 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 1987) (denial of Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) motions subject to abuse of discretion standard on appeal).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. See 1st Cir.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These factors include:</p>\n        <p>the place where civil and political rights are exercised, taxes paid, real and personal property (such as furniture and automobiles) located, driver's and other licenses obtained, bank accounts maintained, location of club and church membership and places of business or employment.</p>\n        <p>Lundquist v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 946 F.2d 8, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting 1 Moore's Federal Practice, p 0.74[3.- 3], at 788 (2d ed. 1991)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In light of our decision upholding the district court's determination that diversity is lacking \"at least as to Lil Izquierdo,\" we need not consider whether diversity is also lacking with respect to the three children</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Contrary to the position taken by appellants, we are not persuaded that the district court's statement, in its order denying the motion for reconsideration, that \"the moment for consideration was the first time that [Lil Izquierdo] was living [in New York],\" constitutes a ruling in advance that appellants are barred from refiling their action in federal district court.  We think that the district court's remarks are better construed as a reminder that diversity is determined as of the date an action is commenced and cannot be created by a change of domicile during the pendency of the action.  In any event, we note that a dismissal for want of jurisdiction does not preclude a second action where there are subsequent developments that cure the jurisdictional deficiency in the first suit.   See, e.g., Costello v. United States, 365 U.S. 265, 284-88 (1961) (holding that dismissal of denaturalization proceedings for defective affidavit of good cause was for lack of jurisdiction and did not bar subsequent proceeding on proper affidavit);   GAF Corp. v. United States, 818 F.2d 901, 913-14 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (stating that jurisdictional deficiencies may be remedied by occurrences subsequent to original dismissal);   Dozier v. Ford Motor Co., 702 F.2d 1189, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Wald, J., dissenting) (observing that lack of complete diversity is a curable defect);  1B James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 0.405 (2d ed. 1993) (stating that a dismissal for want of jurisdiction does not preclude a subsequent action where in the interim facts have occurred which now establish jurisdiction).  We express no opinion on whether a second action in federal court is precluded here</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

On November 29, 1991, Lil Izquierdo and the three children were travelling together in an automobile when it collided with a motor vehicle driven by Rosario Rosa Acevedo.  Lil Izquierdo was rendered unconscious by the accident and remained in a coma until January 6, 1992.  On November 30, 1992, appellants brought a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against Rosario Rosa Acevedo, Denton Construction Company, Integrand Assurance Company, and the Puerto Rico Highway Authority.  The amended complaint, which invokes diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332(a)(1), alleges that all plaintiffs are citizens of New York and all defendants are citizens of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 1994, appellee Denton Construction Company moved to dismiss the action, claiming that diversity jurisdiction is lacking because Lil Izquierdo and the children were domiciled in Puerto Rico at the time of the accident.

Far from demonstrating that Lil Izquierdo had severed ties with Puerto Rico, such evidence suggests that she continued to view it as her home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that the sworn statement dated February 7, 1994, attesting to Lil Izquierdo's change of domicile and her intent to return to New York after further \"rehabilitation,\" was conclusory and also conflicted with Lil Izquierdo's deposition testimony that she lived \"on a day by day basis\" and that \"hopefully, something positive will happen and I'll be able to pay for the house [in Quebradillas].\"   Cf. Hawes v. Club Ecuestre El Comandante, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"366288\"><a href=\"/opinion/366288/ellen-hawes-for-herself-and-in-representation-of-the-minors-ana-francisca/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 704 (1st Cir. 1979) (giving no weight to conclusory statements in affidavit as to intention).  Given the paucity of evidence that Lil Izquierdo changed her domicile to New York, and conflicting evidence to the contrary, we cannot say that the district court committed clear error in making the determination that it did.   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569239\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lundquist,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/569239/courtney-j-lundquist-v-precision-valley-aviation-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">13</span> </a></span>(upholding district court's ruling on diversity where evidence was conflicting);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405338\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">O'Toole,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/405338/3-employee-benefits-ca-1820-10-fed-r-evid-serv-1579-joseph-f-otoole/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">98</span> </a></span>(holding that \"[t]he paucity of appellants' presentation of evidence justifie[d] the district court's conclusion that they had not met [their] burden.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject appellants' argument that the district court erred in not giving them an evidentiary hearing on the jurisdictional issue.  \"A district court has very broad discretion in determining the manner in which it will consider the issue of jurisdiction.\"   Valedon <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480348\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Martinez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/480348/marjorie-marie-valedon-martinez-v-hospital-presbiteriano-de-la-comunidad/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1132</span></a></span>.  Here, appellants were given ample opportunity to present the court with facts relevant to the existence of jurisdiction.  Moreover, appellants did not request an evidentiary hearing until after the case was dismissed.  Under the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding the issue on documentary evidence.   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405338\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">O'Toole,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/405338/3-employee-benefits-ca-1820-10-fed-r-evid-serv-1579-joseph-f-otoole/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">98</span> </a></span>(\"Any failure on the part of appellant to fully avail themselves of the opportunity to present evidence to the court should not now be blamed upon the court's choice not to require an evidentiary hearing.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, we consider the denial of appellants' motion to reconsider.  In this motion, which failed to identify the applicable procedural rule, appellants argued that the district court overlooked the first sworn statement attesting to Lil Izquierdo's intent to make New York her domicile and reached an erroneous legal conclusion.  Appellants supported the motion to reconsider with the second sworn statement which made additional conclusory statements as to Lil Izquierdo's intention.  It is plain from the record that the district court carefully considered these sworn statements in denying the motion for reconsideration.  Moreover, for the reasons we have already articulated, we cannot find that the district court erred in reaching the legal conclusion it did.  Under the circumstances, whether we construe the motion to reconsider as one under Federal Rule Civil Procedure 59(e) or 60(b), we find no abuse of discretion in its denial.   See Kaercher v. Trustees of Health &amp; Hosps, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498046\"><a href=\"/opinion/498046/mary-l-kaercher-v-the-trustees-of-health-and-hospitals-of-the-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir. 1987) (denial of Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) motions subject to abuse of discretion standard on appeal).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569239\"><a href=\"/opinion/569239/courtney-j-lundquist-v-precision-valley-aviation-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting 1 Moore's Federal Practice, p 0.74[3.- 3], at 788 (2d ed. 1991)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In light of our decision upholding the district court's determination that diversity is lacking \"at least as to Lil Izquierdo,\" we need not consider whether diversity is also lacking with respect to the three children</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Contrary to the position taken by appellants, we are not persuaded that the district court's statement, in its order denying the motion for reconsideration, that \"the moment for consideration was the first time that [Lil Izquierdo] was living [in New York],\" constitutes a ruling in advance that appellants are barred from refiling their action in federal district court.  We think that the district court's remarks are better construed as a reminder that diversity is determined as of the date an action is commenced and cannot be created by a change of domicile during the pendency of the action.  In any event, we note that a dismissal for want of jurisdiction does not preclude a second action where there are subsequent developments that cure the jurisdictional deficiency in the first suit.   See, e.g., Costello v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106172\"><a href=\"/opinion/106172/costello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 284-88 (1961) (holding that dismissal of denaturalization proceedings for defective affidavit of good cause was for lack of jurisdiction and did not bar subsequent proceeding on proper affidavit);   GAF Corp. v.

Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 0.405 (2d ed. 1993) (stating that a dismissal for want of jurisdiction does not preclude a subsequent action where in the interim facts have occurred which now establish jurisdiction).  We express no opinion on whether a second action in federal court is precluded here</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
