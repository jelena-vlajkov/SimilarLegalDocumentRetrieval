A grand  jury returned  a\n                                   \n\nfive- count  indictment alleging various firearm  related charges\n\nagainst defendant/appellant Frederick  Hardy and his co-defendant\n\nRaymond Moreno, Jr.   A trial  was held and  the jury found  both\n\ndefendants  guilty   on  all  counts.     Moreno  challenged  his\n\nconviction  in a separate appeal.   United States  v. Moreno, 991\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 943  (1st Cir.)

In  this appeal, Hardy  claims that the\n\ngovernment  made   several  impermissible  arguments   at  trial,\n\nincluding  improperly  commenting  in  its   closing  on  Hardy's\n\ndecision   not  to  testify  at  trial.    We  believe  that  the\n\ngovernment's  comment on  Hardy's silence  at trial  violated the\n\nFifth Amendment, and that this error, coupled with other improper\n\narguments, deprived Hardy of  a fair trial.  We  therefore vacate\n\nHardy's convictions and order a new trial.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n          A.  Facts\n\n          We are concerned here not  with a claim of insufficient\n\nevidence, but  with a case in  which we find that  the government\n\nimproperly commented  on Hardy's  right not  to testify  and made\n\nother  inappropriate  remarks during  the  course  of the  trial.\n\nAccordingly,  our description of the facts is not limited in this\n\ncase to evidence and inferences most favorable to the government,\n\nbut rather it is  designed to provide a  balanced picture of  the\n\nevidence appropriate  for  determining whether  the comments  and\n\nremarks were harmless or prejudicial.  Arrieta-Agressot v. United\n                                                                 \n\n                               -2-\n\nStates, 3 F.3d 525, 528 (1st Cir. 1993).1  \n      \n\n          On  the evening of April 18, 1991,  a group of five law\n\nenforcement officers,  while on foot  patrol in the  Lenox Street\n\nHousing Development  in Boston, Massachusetts, heard  a series of\n\ngunshots coming from another area within the  development.  Three\n\nof  the officers, Officers Garvey, Perkins and Devane, ran in the\n\ndirection of the shots; the other two, Officer Murphy and Trooper\n\nDrummy, returned to a parked cruiser.\n\n          As Officers  Garvey, Perkins,  and Devane  were running\n\ndown Hammond Street, they observed three black males emerge  from\n\na  courtyard in the direction of the gunshots, run across Hammond\n\nStreet,  and disappear  near  a cluster  of buildings  across the\n\nstreet.   One of the officers described  the three men as running\n\nin a line in a  \"hunched over\" manner.  The men  then disappeared\n\nfrom view.  Almost at once,  two of the three officers, joined by\n\nOfficer Murphy  (who had left his  cruiser to assist in  the foot\n\npursuit),  saw three men running through a parking lot behind the\n\ncluster of buildings, and gave chase.  \n\n          The officers saw one of the three men veer off from the\n\nother two  and run in a separate direction.  The second and third\n\nmen were then seen by the  officers to come together briefly  and\n\nappeared to pass an object between them.  Officer Murphy, who was\n\n                    \n\n1  We have  previously stated the relevant facts in United States\n                                                                 \nv. Moreno,  991 F.2d 943 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 457\n                                                 \n(1993).  In light of the fact that we do not view the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the  verdicts in this case, as we did\nin  Moreno, the two recitations of facts differ in some respects.\n          \nId. at 944-46.\n  \n\n                               -3-\n\nclosest  to  the  two   individuals,  described  the  item  being\n\nexchanged as a dark object about one to one-and-a-half feet long.\n\nThe individual who took this object then ran  off through a grass\n\ncourtyard.   The  individual who  passed on  the  object, Raymond\n\nMoreno,   Jr.,  immediately   stopped,   raised  his   arms   and\n\nsurrendered. \n\n          Another  police officer,  Paul MacIsaac,  aided  in the\n\npursuit.  Upon  arriving at  the scene, Officer  Murphy, who  had\n\nMoreno  in custody,  directed  Officer MacIsaac  to  head in  the\n\ndirection  where the  other man,  to whom  Moreno had  passed the\n\nobject, had run.  Officer MacIsaac followed these directions, and\n\ncame across two black males at a nearby intersection, standing on\n\na sidewalk,  looking into  an adjacent  field.  Officer  MacIsaac\n\nquestioned  the two men,  conducted a pat-frisk,  and then placed\n\nthe two men  in the back of his cruiser.   The officer eventually\n\ntook  them to  the station  for questioning  and they  were later\n\nreleased.\n\n          Officer Garvey testified  that in order to  cut off any\n\nescape route that the  fleeing suspect might use, he  had circled\n\naround  to  the opposite  end of  the  grass courtyard.   Officer\n\nGarvey soon saw a black male, wearing dark clothes, who was later\n\nidentified as Frederick Hardy, enter the courtyard.   The Officer\n\ntestified  that he  never  saw  Hardy  with  any  weapon  in  his\n\npossession.  After telling  Hardy several times to stop,  Officer\n\nGarvey  testified  that as  Hardy raised  his  arms --  first his\n\nright, then his  left -- over his  head, he heard a  soft thud on\n\n                               -4-\n\nthe  ground nearby.   Despite being only  two to three  feet away\n\nfrom  Hardy, however, Officer Garvey did not see any object leave\n\nHardy's hands.  Hardy was  then arrested.  Hardy did not  possess\n\nany firearms when  he was  arrested.  After  Officer Garvey  took\n\nHardy to a police cruiser,  he returned to the area.  A search of\n\nthe  area revealed a .32 caliber  pistol about five to eight feet\n\nfrom where Hardy had stopped.\n\n          The  officers searched  the  path between  the area  of\n\nMoreno's  arrest  and the  spot  at  which Officer  Garvey  first\n\nobserved Hardy.   The officers found  a double-barreled sawed-off\n\nshotgun  with a 12 1/2 inch barrel, fully loaded with ammunition,\n\nhidden in bushes along that route.  \n\n          While Moreno  and Hardy  were  being arrested,  Officer\n\nDevane was in search of  the first of the three runners,  who had\n\ngone  off in a separate  direction.  Officer  Devane discovered a\n\nblack male, Steven Fern ndes, sweating and  out of breath, hiding\n\nin some bushes.  After arresting Fern ndes and placing him in the\n\ncruiser,  Officer Devane  found  a semi-automatic  pistol on  the\n\nground near where Fern ndes had been hiding.  \n\n          After receiving  his  Miranda  warning  at  the  police\n                                       \n\nstation,  Hardy said  that  he had  been  at the  development  by\n\nhimself to  visit his niece and  ran when he heard  shots.  Hardy\n\ndenied  knowing  Moreno  or  Fern ndes.    At trial,  however,  a\n\nresident of  the housing development  testified that he  had seen\n\nHardy together with Moreno and Fern ndes a number of times during\n\nthe prior  year.   Additionally,  Officer  Dreary of  the  Boston\n\n                               -5-\n\nPolice  Department testified that in March 1991, he had stopped a\n\nred Isuzu Trooper, and that Hardy was the driver and Moreno was a\n\npassenger in the front seat.\n\n          B.  Proceedings Below\n\n          The grand jury returned a five-count indictment against\n\nHardy and Moreno on June 25,  1991.  Count One charged Hardy with\n\nbeing a felon-in-possession of a firearm,  and Count Four charged\n\nHardy  with being  a felon-in-possession  of ammunition,  both of\n\nwhich were in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(g).  Count Two charged\n\nHardy  with possessing  a  firearm, a  short-barreled Stevens  12\n\ngauge,  double  barrel  shotgun,  in violation  of  26  U.S.C.   \n\n5861(d).  Counts Three and Five charged Moreno with possession of\n\nthe same short-barreled  shotgun and being  a felon-in-possession\n\nof ammunition.\n\n          The  trial took  place over  ten days from  October 28,\n\n1991 to November 14, 1991.   The jury returned guilty verdicts on\n\nall five counts.\n\n          The   court  then  sentenced   Hardy  to   262  months'\n\nincarceration.    Hardy  appealed  both his  conviction  and  his\n\nsentence, and  on November 5,  1992, this Court,  while retaining\n\njurisdiction,  remanded  the  case  to the  district  court  with\n\nrespect  to  some sentencing  issues.   The  district  court then\n\nreaffirmed  Hardy's  sentence, and  Hardy  again  appealed.   See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v.  Hardy, 829 F. Supp. 478 (D.  Mass. 1993).  This\n                       \n\nsecond appeal was then consolidated with the first appeal.\n\n                     II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n                                            \n\n                               -6-\n\n          Hardy argues that  the prosecutor improperly  commented\n\non  his  failure  to testify  at  trial,  and  that this  comment\n\nconstituted a violation of  his Fifth Amendment privilege against\n\nself-incrimination, which unduly prejudiced his ability to obtain\n\na fair  trial.  We will utilize a  de novo standard to review the\n                                          \n\nlegal question of  whether the prosecutor's  argument constituted\n\nconstitutional error.  United States v. Glantz, 810 F.2d 316, 320\n                                              \n\nn.2  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  482 U.S.  929 (1987).   We  will\n                              \n\nreview  the trial court's decision  to deny Hardy's  motion for a\n\nmistrial, based on this  alleged constitutional violation, for an\n\nabuse  of discretion.  Id.   (finding that  district court abused\n                         \n\nits discretion by ordering  a new trial where the  court believed\n\nthat the  prosecutor  improperly  commented  on  the  defendant's\n\nfailure to  testify  or produce  documents  at trial);  see  also\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. Turner, 892 F.2d 11, 12-13 (1st Cir. 1989). \n                       \n\n  III.  THE PROSECUTOR'S COMMENT ON THE DEFENDANTS' SILENCE\n                                                           \n\n   A.  Did the Prosecutor's Comment Violate the Fifth Amendment?\n\n          The  most serious  argument that  Hardy raises  in this\n\nappeal concerns the prosecutor's closing argument at trial.2   In\n\nGriffin  v. California,  380  U.S. 609,  615  (1964), the  United\n                      \n\nStates  Supreme  Court  held  that the  Fifth  Amendment's  self-\n\nincrimination clause  forbids the prosecution from  commenting on\n\nan  accused's  failure to  take the  stand  and testify  during a\n\ntrial.   A  prosecutor's  comment is  improper  where, under  the\n\n                    \n\n2  Defendant Moreno  did not raise this Fifth  Amendment argument\nin his appeal.\n\n                               -7-\n\ncircumstances  of the  case,  \"the language  used was  manifestly\n\nintended or was of  such character that the jury  would naturally\n\nand necessarily  take it to  be a comment  on the failure  of the\n\naccused  to  testify.\"    Glantz,  810  F.2d  at  322  (citations\n                                \n\nomitted).  A prosecutor's  comment does not therefore need  to be\n\ndirect; rather, a prosecutor may run afoul of the rule in Griffin\n                                                                 \n\nby making such comments  inferentially.  See Glantz, 810  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n322; see, e.g.,  United States v. Skandier, 758 F.2d  43, 45 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir.  1985)  (prosecutor's  question  during closing  as  to  how\n\ndefense counsel would explain certain events which occurred, in a\n\ncase  where the defendant had not taken the stand, was improper);\n\nUnited  States v.  Flannery, 451  F.2d 880,  882 (1st  Cir. 1971)\n                           \n\n(prosecutor's   comment  that  certain  government  evidence  was\n\nuncontradicted,  when  contradiction  would  have   required  the\n\ndefendant to take the stand, was improper).\n\n          We believe that here,  the prosecutor improperly called\n\nattention  to the failure of Hardy  to take the stand and testify\n\nat trial.  The prosecutor stated:\n\n            Ladies and gentlemen, the  evidence here,\n            the only reasonable  conclusion that  can\n            come from this evidence is that Mr. Hardy\n            possessed that .32 caliber pistol loaded,\n            Mr.   Moreno   possessed  the   sawed-off\n            shotgun  loaded,  and  that   during  the\n            course of the chase, Mr. Moreno passed it\n            off to Mr. Hardy so that he could get rid\n            of   it.  What the evidence shows is that\n            these  two  defendants  that  night  were\n            running and hiding.  They'd been involved\n            in  that          incident and  then they\n            unfortunately   had  the   misfortune  of\n            running  right into  the police  who just\n            happened to be in the area, and they were\n            running  and  hiding,  running  from  the\n\n                               -8-\n\n            police and hiding  the evidence from  the\n            police.  They're still running and hiding\n                                                     \n            today.   The  time has  come for  them to\n                                                     \n            stop running and  stop hiding.   The time\n                                         \n            has come for them to  be held accountable\n            for the wrongful acts that they committed\n            on  the  night  of  April 18th,  1991  in\n            Boston.   That time  is now and  only you\n            can  hold them  accountable.   Thank you.\n            (emphasis added).\n\nDefense counsel objected  and requested  a limiting  instruction.\n\nThe  district   court  was  initially  concerned   that  such  an\n\ninstruction  might hurt rather than  help, because the jury might\n\nnot  have  construed  the  prosecutor's remark  as  a  comment on\n\ndefendants' silence.  The court then asked the government:\n\n            Tell me  this:   In what other  sense can\n            the    Government    argue   that    [the\n            defendants] are running  and hiding  even\n            at this time?\n\nThe government replied:\n\n            Because, your Honor,  I'm just drawing an\n            analogy between their running  and hiding\n            on that night and the Government's burden\n            of  proving  guilt  beyond  a  reasonable\n            doubt.\n\nThe court stated:\n\n            I'm   going   to   give    the   limiting\n            instruction.  It doesn't satisfy me.\n\nThe court then gave the following instruction to the jury:\n\n            Members  of  the  jury,  I   sustain  the\n            objection to the argument . . . that even\n            today  the  defendants  are  running  and\n            hiding.  You will disregard that argument\n            and not  consider it  in  any respect  in\n            your  consideration  of  the evidence  in\n            this case.\n\nThe court  then asked defense  counsel if they  requested further\n\ninstructions,  and they replied no.   The defendants  moved for a\n\n                               -9-\n\nmistrial, and the court denied these motions.3\n\n          The prosecutor's  comment during his closing  set up an\n\nanalogy  between what the defendants were  allegedly doing on the\n\nnight  of  the  crime --  running  and  hiding  -- and  what  the\n\nprosecutor believed they were doing  during the trial --  running\n\nand hiding.  Of course, the defendants were not literally running\n\nfrom  the trial  or hiding during  the trial.   Rather, they were\n\nboth in custody and were sitting  silently during each day of the\n\nproceeding.   Neither defendant testified on his own behalf.  The\n\nnatural and necessary implication  of the prosecutor's remark was\n\ntherefore  that the  defendants  were running  from the  evidence\n\npresented against them, and hiding behind their right  to silence\n\nduring the  trial.   The prosecutor's comment  therefore violated\n\nthe Fifth Amendment.  \n\n          B.  Is a New Trial Required?\n\n          Where  it  appears  that  the prosecutor  has  made  an\n\nimproper argument  to the  jury, this Circuit  has established  a\n\nstandard to evaluate whether a new trial is required.  \n\n            Although  we  have used  slightly varying\n            terminology in  describing [the relevant]\n            factors, the common denominators  are (1)\n            the severity of  the misconduct; (2)  the\n            context in which it occurred; (3) whether\n            the judge gave any  curative instructions\n            and   the   likely    effect   of    such\n            instructions; and (4) the strength of the\n\n                    \n\n3  In its charge to the jury, the trial court did state generally\nthat the government had the burden of proof, that the defendants'\nhad  a constitutional  right not  to testify,  and that  the jury\nshould not draw any negative inferences from the exercise of that\nright.  These comments, however, in no way specifically addressed\nthe prosecutor's improper remark.\n\n                               -10-\n\n            evidence against the defendant.\n\nUnited  States v.  Manning,  23 F.3d  570,  574 (1st  Cir.  1994)\n                          \n\n(citations  omitted).    We  treat  these  factors  in order,  to\n\ndetermine if the prosecutor's comment was harmless.  \n\n          First,  as  we discussed  above,  we  believe that  the\n\nprosecutor's  argument  constituted a  violation  of the  Griffin\n                                                                 \n\nrule.   Additionally,  we believe  that the  comments were,  in a\n\nsense, deliberate.   In his closing argument, the  prosecutor had\n\nconstructed  an  analogy based  on the  facts  of the  case, with\n\ncertain  rhetoric  significantly repeated,  which appeared  to be\n\nplanned.   We do  not believe  that the  prosecutor intentionally\n\nintended to influence the jury by commenting on  Hardy's silence,\n\nand we hope  that our belief  is not misplaced.   We do  believe,\n\nhowever, that  when preparing or reviewing  his proposed closing,\n\nthe  prosecutor  should  have  known  that  such  a  comment  was\n\nimproper.  \n\n          Second, we point out that this comment was made against\n\na  backdrop where the possibility that Hardy would receive a fair\n\ntrial  was already in danger -- that is, the prosecutor's closing\n\nwas not an isolated instance of misconduct.  See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nCapone, 683 F.2d  582, 586 (1st Cir. 1982).   In Moreno, 991 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  947-51, we addressed several  arguments, (two in the majority\n\nopinion, two more in the dissent) which Hardy has also raised  in\n\nthis  appeal,   relating  to  improper  arguments   made  by  the\n\ngovernment during trial.   Our conclusions in Moreno  are equally\n                                                    \n\napplicable to this case.\n\n                               -11-\n\n          In Moreno,  we noted  that in the  prosecutor's opening\n                   \n\nremarks,  he stated,  \"the evidence  will show  that [the  police\n\nofficers] were doing their jobs protecting the community that has\n\nbeen  plagued  by  violence,  senseless  violence, shootings  and\n\nkillings.  That's  why they were there and that's  why we're here\n\ntoday.\"    Moreno, 991  F.2d at 947.   We concluded  that because\n                 \n\nthere was no evidence  in the case about \"senseless  violence\" or\n\n\"shootings  and  killings,\"  it  was patently  improper  for  the\n\nprosecutor to  make those remarks.  Id.   The remarks played upon\n                                      \n\nthe jury's  emotional reaction  to neighborhood violence  and was\n\noutside the bounds of legitimate argument.  Id.  \n                                              \n\n          We  were equally disturbed by a  second argument by the\n\nprosecutor which  not  only  reiterated  the  senseless  violence\n\ntheme, but also established a second departure from the \"straight\n\nand narrow.\"   Id. at 948.  The prosecutor  argued in his closing\n                 \n\nthat  the  shotgun  was not  just  tossed  away but  deliberately\n\nconcealed,  and continued:  \"Forget about the fact that maybe Mr.\n\nHooker  [who lived  nearby] or his  wife or his  three kids might\n\ncome out and  look at the gun and get their heads blown off.  But\n\nI'm sure Mr.  Hardy had other  things on his  mind going  through\n\nthere, like getting  away from the cops.\"  Although we found that\n\nboth of these arguments  were improper, we found that  the errors\n\nwere harmless as they related to Moreno.4\n\n                    \n\n4  We  stated that the prosecutor's comments about  the danger to\nMr. Hooker and his family,  although improper, were harmless when\nconsidered  against Moreno,  in part,  because the  objectionable\nremarks did not directly  relate to Moreno.  Moreno,  991 F.2d at\n                                                   \n948.  The improper remarks, however, did have a greater effect on\n\n                               -12-\n\n          The  dissent  found  two  more arguments  made  by  the\n\nprosecutors  to be  troublesome.   The prosecutor  vouched for  a\n\ngovernment witness, intimating  that that witness possessed  some\n\ninformation  beyond   the  evidence   presented.    Id.   at  951\n                                                      \n\n(Torruella,  J., dissenting).    The prosecutor  also  improperly\n\ndisparaged defense counsel, by stating that they were paid to see\n\nthings in a  different way,  defense counsel was  talking out  of\n\nboth sides of his mouth, and  that one defense argument was meant\n\nto divert the jury's attention.  Id.; see, e.g., United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBoldt,  929 F.2d  35,  40  (1st  Cir.  1991)  (finding  that  the\n     \n\nprosecutor's statement  that \"it's  a favorite defense  tactic to\n\ntry  to  get you  to focus  on  unnecessary facts\"  was improper,\n\nespecially in light  of the institutional  nature of the  comment\n\nwhich  cast suspicion on the role of defense counsel in general).\n\nThe  jury  was therefore  exposed to  a  number of  emotional and\n\nprejudicial  arguments  which  potentially  interfered  with  its\n\nability to appraise the evidence objectively and dispassionately.\n\n          Third,   while  the   trial   court  gave   a  limiting\n\ninstruction,  and  Hardy's counsel  did  not  request a  stronger\n\ninstruction,  we do not believe  that the curative  effect of the\n\njudge's  instruction  negated  the effects  of  the  prosecutor's\n\nconstitutional indiscretion.   Whether a curative  instruction is\n\nsufficient to avoid prejudice depends on the impact of the remark\n\n                    \n\nHardy's  ability to  get a  fair trial,  because the  remarks did\nrelate directly to his alleged actions. \n\n                               -13-\n\ntaken in the context of the whole of the evidence, including  any\n\nother aggravating remarks or  circumstances that may increase the\n\nrisk  that  the  improper remark  did  affect  the  outcome.   An\n\nimproper comment  that may seem insignificant  where the evidence\n\nis overwhelming can  assume a  very different aspect  in a  close\n\ncase.  This is such a close case. \n\n          Finally, the strength of the evidence proffered against\n\nHardy was not overwhelming.  First, the government's case against\n\nHardy  largely  rested  on  the credibility  of  Officer  Garvey.\n\nTherefore,  if  the jury  disbelieved,  or  had questions  about,\n\nOfficer Garvey's  testimony, we do  not believe that  Hardy would\n\nhave  been convicted.   Second, the jury  was required to  draw a\n\nnumber of inferences in  order to convict Hardy.  No officer ever\n\nsaw  Hardy possess either  the pistol  or the  sawed-off shotgun.\n\nWhile Officer  Garvey testified that  after he stopped  Hardy, he\n\nheard a  soft thud as Hardy  raised his arms, Garvey  never saw a\n\ngun in Hardy's hand, or fall from his hand, despite the fact that\n\nhe  was only  two to  three feet  away from  Hardy.   Rather, the\n\nofficers  found the  pistol later,  in the  area where  Hardy was\n\nstopped.   Additionally, other officers found  the shotgun hidden\n\nin  an area that Hardy  had seemingly passed  through, but nobody\n\nsaw Hardy dispose of the weapon there.  There were also other men\n\nstopped in the area  who could have somehow been  responsible for\n\nthe guns.  We  do not believe that this  circumstantial evidence,\n\nwhich for the most  part rested on Officer  Garvey's credibility,\n\nclearly established  Hardy's guilt.   Moreover, in  light of  the\n\n                               -14-\n\nprosecution's  comment, the  jury  may very  well have  wondered,\n\neither consciously or subconsciously, what Hardy had to say about\n\nthe  extent of his involvement,  and concluded that  he must have\n\nhad something to hide because of his failure to testify.\n\n          The  district court  did  not evaluate  these  relevant\n\nfactors  on the record to determine  if a new trial was warranted\n\nin  light of  the  prosecutor's improper  closing argument,  when\n\nHardy moved  for a mistrial.  Because all of these factors cut in\n\nfavor of  a new trial, we believe  that the district court abused\n\nits  discretion when  it denied Hardy's  motion.   The government\n\nimproperly commented on Hardy's failure  to testify, and in light\n\nof  the government's  other  improper comments  and the  evidence\n\npresented, we  believe that  this  constituted reversible  error.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Barton, 731 F.2d  669, 675 (10th Cir.\n                                  \n\n1984).    For   the   foregoing   reasons,  we   vacate   Hardy's\n                                                                 \n\nconvictions and order a new trial.\n                                 \n\n                               -15-\n",

Three\n\nof  the officers, Officers Garvey, Perkins and Devane, ran in the\n\ndirection of the shots; the other two, Officer Murphy and Trooper\n\nDrummy, returned to a parked cruiser.\n\n          As Officers  Garvey, Perkins,  and Devane  were running\n\ndown Hammond Street, they observed three black males emerge  from\n\na  courtyard in the direction of the gunshots, run across Hammond\n\nStreet,  and disappear  near  a cluster  of buildings  across the\n\nstreet.   One of the officers described  the three men as running\n\nin a line in a  \"hunched over\" manner.  The men  then disappeared\n\nfrom view.  Almost at once,  two of the three officers, joined by\n\nOfficer Murphy  (who had left his  cruiser to assist in  the foot\n\npursuit),  saw three men running through a parking lot behind the\n\ncluster of buildings, and gave chase.  \n\n          The officers saw one of the three men veer off from the\n\nother two  and run in a separate direction.  The second and third\n\nmen were then seen by the  officers to come together briefly  and\n\nappeared to pass an object between them.

The  individual who  passed on  the  object, Raymond\n\nMoreno,   Jr.,  immediately   stopped,   raised  his   arms   and\n\nsurrendered. \n\n          Another  police officer,  Paul MacIsaac,  aided  in the\n\npursuit.  Upon  arriving at  the scene, Officer  Murphy, who  had\n\nMoreno  in custody,  directed  Officer MacIsaac  to  head in  the\n\ndirection  where the  other man,  to whom  Moreno had  passed the\n\nobject, had run.  Officer MacIsaac followed these directions, and\n\ncame across two black males at a nearby intersection, standing on\n\na sidewalk,  looking into  an adjacent  field.  Officer  MacIsaac\n\nquestioned  the two men,  conducted a pat-frisk,  and then placed\n\nthe two men  in the back of his cruiser.   The officer eventually\n\ntook  them to  the station  for questioning  and they  were later\n\nreleased.\n\n          Officer Garvey testified  that in order to  cut off any\n\nescape route that the  fleeing suspect might use, he  had circled\n\naround  to  the opposite  end of  the  grass courtyard.   Officer\n\nGarvey soon saw a black male, wearing dark clothes, who was later\n\nidentified as Frederick Hardy, enter the courtyard.   The Officer\n\ntestified  that he  never  saw  Hardy  with  any  weapon  in  his\n\npossession.  After telling  Hardy several times to stop,  Officer\n\nGarvey  testified  that as  Hardy raised  his  arms --  first his\n\nright, then his  left -- over his  head, he heard a  soft thud on\n\n                               -4-\n\nthe  ground nearby.   Despite being only  two to three  feet away\n\nfrom  Hardy, however, Officer Garvey did not see any object leave\n\nHardy's hands.  Hardy was  then arrested.  Hardy did not  possess\n\nany firearms when  he was  arrested.  After  Officer Garvey  took\n\nHardy to a police cruiser,  he returned to the area.  A search of\n\nthe  area revealed a .32 caliber  pistol about five to eight feet\n\nfrom where Hardy had stopped.\n\n          The  officers searched  the  path between  the area  of\n\nMoreno's  arrest  and the  spot  at  which Officer  Garvey  first\n\nobserved Hardy.   The officers found  a double-barreled sawed-off\n\nshotgun  with a 12 1/2 inch barrel, fully loaded with ammunition,\n\nhidden in bushes along that route.  \n\n          While Moreno  and Hardy  were  being arrested,  Officer\n\nDevane was in search of  the first of the three runners,  who had\n\ngone  off in a separate  direction.  Officer  Devane discovered a\n\nblack male, Steven Fern ndes, sweating and  out of breath, hiding\n\nin some bushes.  After arresting Fern ndes and placing him in the\n\ncruiser,  Officer Devane  found  a semi-automatic  pistol on  the\n\nground near where Fern ndes had been hiding.  \n\n          After receiving  his  Miranda  warning  at  the  police\n                                       \n\nstation,  Hardy said  that  he had  been  at the  development  by\n\nhimself to  visit his niece and  ran when he heard  shots.  Hardy\n\ndenied  knowing  Moreno  or  Fern ndes.    At trial,  however,  a\n\nresident of  the housing development  testified that he  had seen\n\nHardy together with Moreno and Fern ndes a number of times during\n\nthe prior  year.   Additionally,  Officer  Dreary of  the  Boston\n\n                               -5-\n\nPolice  Department testified that in March 1991, he had stopped a\n\nred Isuzu Trooper, and that Hardy was the driver and Moreno was a\n\npassenger in the front seat.\n\n          B.  Proceedings Below\n\n          The grand jury returned a five-count indictment against\n\nHardy and Moreno on June 25,  1991.  Count One charged Hardy with\n\nbeing a felon-in-possession of a firearm,  and Count Four charged\n\nHardy  with being  a felon-in-possession  of ammunition,  both of\n\nwhich were in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(g).  Count Two charged\n\nHardy  with possessing  a  firearm, a  short-barreled Stevens  12\n\ngauge,  double  barrel  shotgun,  in violation  of  26  U.S.C.   \n\n5861(d).  Counts Three and Five charged Moreno with possession of\n\nthe same short-barreled  shotgun and being  a felon-in-possession\n\nof ammunition.\n\n          The  trial took  place over  ten days from  October 28,\n\n1991 to November 14, 1991.   The jury returned guilty verdicts on\n\nall five counts.\n\n          The   court  then  sentenced   Hardy  to   262  months'\n\nincarceration.    Hardy  appealed  both his  conviction  and  his\n\nsentence, and  on November 5,  1992, this Court,  while retaining\n\njurisdiction,  remanded  the  case  to the  district  court  with\n\nrespect  to  some sentencing  issues.   The  district  court then\n\nreaffirmed  Hardy's  sentence, and  Hardy  again  appealed.   See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v.

The prosecutor stated:\n\n            Ladies and gentlemen, the  evidence here,\n            the only reasonable  conclusion that  can\n            come from this evidence is that Mr. Hardy\n            possessed that .32 caliber pistol loaded,\n            Mr.   Moreno   possessed  the   sawed-off\n            shotgun  loaded,  and  that   during  the\n            course of the chase, Mr. Moreno passed it\n            off to Mr. Hardy so that he could get rid\n            of   it.  What the evidence shows is that\n            these  two  defendants  that  night  were\n            running and hiding.  They'd been involved\n            in  that          incident and  then they\n            unfortunately   had  the   misfortune  of\n            running  right into  the police  who just\n            happened to be in the area, and they were\n            running  and  hiding,  running  from  the\n\n                               -8-\n\n            police and hiding  the evidence from  the\n            police.  They're still running and hiding\n                                                     \n            today.   The  time has  come for  them to\n                                                     \n            stop running and  stop hiding.   The time\n                                         \n            has come for them to  be held accountable\n            for the wrongful acts that they committed\n            on  the  night  of  April 18th,  1991  in\n            Boston.   That time  is now and  only you\n            can  hold them  accountable.   Thank you.\n            (emphasis added).\n\nDefense counsel objected  and requested  a limiting  instruction.\n\nThe  district   court  was  initially  concerned   that  such  an\n\ninstruction  might hurt rather than  help, because the jury might\n\nnot  have  construed  the  prosecutor's remark  as  a  comment on\n\ndefendants' silence.  The court then asked the government:\n\n            Tell me  this:   In what other  sense can\n            the    Government    argue   that    [the\n            defendants] are running  and hiding  even\n            at this time?\n\nThe government replied:\n\n            Because, your Honor,  I'm just drawing an\n            analogy between their running  and hiding\n            on that night and the Government's burden\n            of  proving  guilt  beyond  a  reasonable\n            doubt.\n\nThe court stated:\n\n            I'm   going   to   give    the   limiting\n            instruction.  It doesn't satisfy me.\n\nThe court then gave the following instruction to the jury:\n\n            Members  of  the  jury,  I   sustain  the\n            objection to the argument . . . that even\n            today  the  defendants  are  running  and\n            hiding.  You will disregard that argument\n            and not  consider it  in  any respect  in\n            your  consideration  of  the evidence  in\n            this case.\n\nThe court  then asked defense  counsel if they  requested further\n\ninstructions,  and they replied no.   The defendants  moved for a\n\n                               -9-\n\nmistrial, and the court denied these motions.3\n\n          The prosecutor's  comment during his closing  set up an\n\nanalogy  between what the defendants were  allegedly doing on the\n\nnight  of  the  crime --  running  and  hiding  -- and  what  the\n\nprosecutor believed they were doing  during the trial --  running\n\nand hiding.  Of course, the defendants were not literally running\n\nfrom  the trial  or hiding during  the trial.   Rather, they were\n\nboth in custody and were sitting  silently during each day of the\n\nproceeding.   Neither defendant testified on his own behalf.  The\n\nnatural and necessary implication  of the prosecutor's remark was\n\ntherefore  that the  defendants  were running  from the  evidence\n\npresented against them, and hiding behind their right  to silence\n\nduring the  trial.   The prosecutor's comment  therefore violated\n\nthe Fifth Amendment.  \n\n          B.  Is a New Trial Required?\n\n          Where  it  appears  that  the prosecutor  has  made  an\n\nimproper argument  to the  jury, this Circuit  has established  a\n\nstandard to evaluate whether a new trial is required.  \n\n            Although  we  have used  slightly varying\n            terminology in  describing [the relevant]\n            factors, the common denominators  are (1)\n            the severity of  the misconduct; (2)  the\n            context in which it occurred; (3) whether\n            the judge gave any  curative instructions\n            and   the   likely    effect   of    such\n            instructions; and (4) the strength of the\n\n                    \n\n3  In its charge to the jury, the trial court did state generally\nthat the government had the burden of proof, that the defendants'\nhad  a constitutional  right not  to testify,  and that  the jury\nshould not draw any negative inferences from the exercise of that\nright.  These comments, however, in no way specifically addressed\nthe prosecutor's improper remark.\n\n                               -10-\n\n            evidence against the defendant.\n\nUnited  States v.  Manning,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/195356/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  574 (1st  Cir.  1994)\n                          \n\n(citations  omitted).    We  treat  these  factors  in order,  to\n\ndetermine if the prosecutor's comment was harmless.  \n\n          First,  as  we discussed  above,  we  believe that  the\n\nprosecutor's  argument  constituted a  violation  of the  Griffin\n                                                                 \n\nrule.   Additionally,  we believe  that the  comments were,  in a\n\nsense, deliberate.   In his closing argument, the  prosecutor had\n\nconstructed  an  analogy based  on the  facts  of the  case, with\n\ncertain  rhetoric  significantly repeated,  which appeared  to be\n\nplanned.   We do  not believe  that the  prosecutor intentionally\n\nintended to influence the jury by commenting on  Hardy's silence,\n\nand we hope  that our belief  is not misplaced.   We do  believe,\n\nhowever, that  when preparing or reviewing  his proposed closing,\n\nthe  prosecutor  should  have  known  that  such  a  comment  was\n\nimproper.  \n\n          Second, we point out that this comment was made against\n\na  backdrop where the possibility that Hardy would receive a fair\n\ntrial  was already in danger -- that is, the prosecutor's closing\n\nwas not an isolated instance of misconduct.  See United States v.\n                                                              \n\nCapone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406407\"><a href=\"/opinion/406407/united-states-v-joseph-capone-united-states-of-america-v-richard-murnane/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 (1st Cir. 1982).

The prosecutor  also  improperly\n\ndisparaged defense counsel, by stating that they were paid to see\n\nthings in a  different way,  defense counsel was  talking out  of\n\nboth sides of his mouth, and  that one defense argument was meant\n\nto divert the jury's attention.  Id.; see, e.g., United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBoldt,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558024\"><a href=\"/opinion/558024/united-states-v-david-w-boldt/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  40  (1st  Cir.  1991)  (finding  that  the\n     \n\nprosecutor's statement  that \"it's  a favorite defense  tactic to\n\ntry  to  get you  to focus  on  unnecessary facts\"  was improper,\n\nespecially in light  of the institutional  nature of the  comment\n\nwhich  cast suspicion on the role of defense counsel in general).\n\nThe  jury  was therefore  exposed to  a  number of  emotional and\n\nprejudicial  arguments  which  potentially  interfered  with  its\n\nability to appraise the evidence objectively and dispassionately.\n\n          Third,   while  the   trial   court  gave   a  limiting\n\ninstruction,  and  Hardy's counsel  did  not  request a  stronger\n\ninstruction,  we do not believe  that the curative  effect of the\n\njudge's  instruction  negated  the effects  of  the  prosecutor's\n\nconstitutional indiscretion.   Whether a curative  instruction is\n\nsufficient to avoid prejudice depends on the impact of the remark\n\n                    \n\nHardy's  ability to  get a  fair trial,  because the  remarks did\nrelate directly to his alleged actions. \n\n                               -13-\n\ntaken in the context of the whole of the evidence, including  any\n\nother aggravating remarks or  circumstances that may increase the\n\nrisk  that  the  improper remark  did  affect  the  outcome.   An\n\nimproper comment  that may seem insignificant  where the evidence\n\nis overwhelming can  assume a  very different aspect  in a  close\n\ncase.  This is such a close case. \n\n          Finally, the strength of the evidence proffered against\n\nHardy was not overwhelming.  First, the government's case against\n\nHardy  largely  rested  on  the credibility  of  Officer  Garvey.\n\nTherefore,  if  the jury  disbelieved,  or  had questions  about,\n\nOfficer Garvey's  testimony, we do  not believe that  Hardy would\n\nhave  been convicted.   Second, the jury  was required to  draw a\n\nnumber of inferences in  order to convict Hardy.  No officer ever\n\nsaw  Hardy possess either  the pistol  or the  sawed-off shotgun.\n\nWhile Officer  Garvey testified that  after he stopped  Hardy, he\n\nheard a  soft thud as Hardy  raised his arms, Garvey  never saw a\n\ngun in Hardy's hand, or fall from his hand, despite the fact that\n\nhe  was only  two to  three feet  away from  Hardy.   Rather, the\n\nofficers  found the  pistol later,  in the  area where  Hardy was\n\nstopped.   Additionally, other officers found  the shotgun hidden\n\nin  an area that Hardy  had seemingly passed  through, but nobody\n\nsaw Hardy dispose of the weapon there.  There were also other men\n\nstopped in the area  who could have somehow been  responsible for\n\nthe guns.  We  do not believe that this  circumstantial evidence,\n\nwhich for the most  part rested on Officer  Garvey's credibility,\n\nclearly established  Hardy's guilt.   Moreover, in  light of  the\n\n                               -14-\n\nprosecution's  comment, the  jury  may very  well have  wondered,\n\neither consciously or subconsciously, what Hardy had to say about\n\nthe  extent of his involvement,  and concluded that  he must have\n\nhad something to hide because of his failure to testify.\n\n          The  district court  did  not evaluate  these  relevant\n\nfactors  on the record to determine  if a new trial was warranted\n\nin  light of  the  prosecutor's improper  closing argument,  when\n\nHardy moved  for a mistrial.  Because all of these factors cut in\n\nfavor of  a new trial, we believe  that the district court abused\n\nits  discretion when  it denied Hardy's  motion.   The government\n\nimproperly commented on Hardy's failure  to testify, and in light\n\nof  the government's  other  improper comments  and the  evidence\n\npresented, we  believe that  this  constituted reversible  error.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Barton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433625\"><a href=\"/opinion/433625/the-united-states-of-america-v-james-dean-barton/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 675 (10th Cir.\n                                  \n\n1984).
