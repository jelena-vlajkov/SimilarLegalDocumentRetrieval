See  42 U.S.C.    1983 (1993).   We\n                                 \n\nvacate the judgment, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Jirau,  a known  member  of the  New Progressive  Party\n\n(NPP), worked for the UPR Agricultural Extension Service/Mayaguez\n\nfor thirty years.   In 1982 she was appointed  Assistant Director\n\nof the UPR Home Economics and Nutrition Program, a position which\n\ncarried a higher salary  and required her to supervise  more than\n\n200 UPR employees.   Following the 1984  general elections, which\n\nswept the  Popular Democratic Party (PDP)  into office throughout\n\nPuerto Rico,  defendant Fernando Agrait was  appointed UPR presi-\n\ndent, the first  of several key UPR posts to  be filled by promi-\n\nnent PDP members.  In August 1986 the UPR administration informed\n\nJirau that her position as Assistant Director was to be abolished\n\nin an overall  reorganization of  the \"inefficient\"  Agricultural\n\nExtension Service, and  that henceforth  Jirau would  serve as  a\n\nSpecialist in Consumer Education, which neither entailed supervi-\n\n                                2\n\nsory responsibility  nor entitled her to  the prerogatives (e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nsecretary,  direct phone  line)  and salary  associated with  her\n\nformer  position.    Shortly  after UPR  formally  abolished  the\n\nposition  held by Jirau, Ms. Colon Hernandez, a known PDP member,\n\nwas appointed to a newly-named position incorporating the identi-\n\ncal job functions.  As part and parcel of the reorganization, UPR\n\n\"demoted\" five other employees,  all NPP affiliates, and replaced\n\nthem with PDP members.   Contemporaneously, during a conversation\n\nwith one  of the five  demotees, defendant Hernandez  Gaya stated\n\nthat  the new  PDP administration  \"had to  select its  own team,\n\nloyal to the ideology of  the party in power.\"  As  Jirau consid-\n\nered her \"demotion\" intolerable, she accepted early retirement in\n\nAugust 1986.\n\n          Jirau, and others similarly  situated, sued UPR and the\n\nfour  individual administrators,  alleging  that the  \"demotions\"\n\nwere politically motivated in  violation of their First Amendment\n\nrights, and had  been effected without a pre-demotion  hearing in\n\nviolation of their procedural due  process rights under the Fifth\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments.  The plaintiffs sought declaratory and\n\nequitable  (reinstatement)  relief as  well  as compensatory  and\n\npunitive  damages.   After  settling with  the other  plaintiffs,\n\ndefendants  moved for summary judgment on both Jirau claims.  The\n\ndistrict court  ultimately adopted the report  and recommendation\n\nof a magistrate judge, concluding that Jirau had neither generat-\n\ned a trialworthy issue  as to whether defendants harbored  a dis-\n\ncriminatory animus, nor rebutted the nondiscriminatory motivation\n\n                                3\n\nalleged by defendants.   Summary judgment entered for defendants,\n\nand Jirau appealed. \n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.   First Amendment Claim: Politically Discriminatory Demotion\n                                                               \n\n     1.   Evidence of Discriminatory Animus\n                                           \n\n          Jirau contends  that the  summary judgment must  be set\n\naside because  the district court ignored  or discounted evidence\n\nsufficient to  generate  a trialworthy  issue as  to whether  the\n\ndefendants harbored a discriminatory animus.  We review the grant\n\nof summary judgment de  novo, under the same  standards incumbent\n                            \n\non  the  district court,  to  determine  whether \"the  pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and  admissions on file,\n\ntogether  with  the affidavits,  if any,  show  that there  is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material  fact and that the moving  party\n\nis  entitled to judgment as  a matter of  law.\"  Fed.  R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c);  Velez-Gomez v. SMA Life Assurance Co., 8 F.3d 873, 874-75\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir.  1993).  We view the record evidence, and draw all fair\n\ninferences, in the light  most favorable to the nonmoving  party.\n\nId.\n   \n\n          A plaintiff asserting a political  discrimination claim\n\nunder the First Amendment bears the preliminary burden of produc-\n\ning  competent direct  or circumstantial evidence  that political\n\naffiliation played a \"substantial\" role in the adverse employment\n\ndecision.  Ferrer  v. Zayas, 914  F.2d 309, 311 (1st  Cir. 1990).\n                           \n\nSee  Anthony v. Sundlun, 952 F.2d 603,  605 (1st Cir. 1991).  The\n                       \n\n                                4\n\ndistrict court  aptly observed that mere evidence  that Jirau had\n\nbeen \"demoted\"    by reassignment to a nonsupervisory position at\n\nreduced  salary     was  insufficient evidence  of discriminatory\n\nanimus,  because  it  is  entirely  consistent  with  defendants'\n\n\"reorganization\" defense.   However, Jirau  proffered other  cir-\n\ncumstantial evidence probative of possible discriminatory motiva-\n\ntion:  (1) all defendants were known PDP members, while Jirau and\n\nall  her fellow demotees were members of the opposition NPP, see,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Acevedo-Diaz v.  Aponte, 1  F.3d 62,  69 (1st  Cir. 1993);\n                              \n\nRodriguez-Pinto  v. Tirado-Delgado,  982  F.2d 34,  40 (1st  Cir.\n                                  \n\n1993); Kercado-Melendez  v. Aponte-Roque, 829 F.2d  255, 264 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1987), cert. denied, 486  U.S. 1044 (1988);  and (2) plain-\n                         \n\ntiffs'   previous  positions,  though  formally  abolished,  were\n\npromptly reconstituted under different titles and filled by known\n\nPDP  members, see, e.g., Rodriguez-Pinto,  982 F.2d at  40.  Most\n                                        \n\nimportantly, however,  Jirau proffered direct evidence  of a dis-\n                                             \n\ncriminatory  motivation:   the  affidavit attesting  to defendant\n\nHernandez Gaya's  statement that  the UPR administration  \"had to\n\nselect  its own  team,  loyal to  the ideology  of  the party  in\n\npower.\"   E.g.,  Acevedo-Diaz,  1 F.3d  at  69-70 n.6  (defendant\n                             \n\nallegedly told plaintiff that  she was \"not a person  of trust\");\n\nNereida-Gonzalez v.  Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701,  706 (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1993) (defendants told plaintiff  \"outright\" she would be demoted\n\nbecause of her NPP  affiliation); Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig, 963\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 2, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1992) (defendant asked plaintiff whether he\n\nhad  met with NPP  members).  Assuming  its truth, as  we must on\n\n                                5\n\nsummary judgment, see Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 877, this  affidavit\n                                 \n\nsatisfied the  threshold burden of  proof incumbent on  Jirau for\n\npresent purposes.\n\n          The magistrate-judge's reliance  on Jirau's failure  to\n\nrebut  the reorganization  defense was  flawed.   First Amendment\n\npolitical discrimination  claims are not subject to the Title VII\n\nburden-shifting device.  Whereas a Title VII claimant retains the\n\nburden  of proof  throughout, even  after  the burden  of limited\n\nproduction has shifted  to the  Title VII defendant  to assert  a\n          \n\nnondiscriminatory motivation for  the challenged  action, in  the\n\nFirst Amendment context Jirau  successfully foisted the burden of\n\nproof  onto these defendants simply by  meeting her own threshold\n     \n\nburden  of persuasion.  See  Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d  at 66-67 (con-\n                                         \n\ntrasting Burdine and Mt.  Healthy \"burden shifting\").  Defendants\n                                 \n\nwere required to establish  the absence of a trialworthy  dispute\n\nas  to  whether \"efficiency\"  was their  only motivation  for the\n\nJirau demotion.   Summary judgment would have been  warranted, in\n\nother  words, only if  defendants' evidentiary  proffer compelled\n                                                                 \n\nthe finding  that political  discrimination did not  constitute a\n\n\"but for\"  cause for  the demotion.   See id.  at 68.   Since the\n                                             \n\naffidavit directly evidenced a discriminatory animus at odds with\n\ntheir reorganization defense, and required credibility determina-\n\ntions appropriate  to  the trier  of  fact, defendants  were  not\n\nentitled to summary judgment. \n\n          Secondly,  though Jirau  was not  required to  meet the\n                                                    \n\nreorganization defense  in order  to avert summary  judgment, she\n\n                                6\n\ndid so.  Notwithstanding defendants' proffer that the Agricultur-\n\nal Extension Service and  its directors had proven \"inefficient,\"\n\nJirau countered with several affidavits from former UPR officials\n\nattesting to her efficiency, as well as the efficiency of her co-\n\nworkers and department.   See id. at 71 (evidence  that plaintiff\n                                 \n\nefficiently  performed  job  may  rebut  reorganization  defense)\n\n(citing  cases).   Thus,  Jirau's  \"rebuttal\"  evidence  likewise\n\ngenerated a  credibility dispute  critical to  the reorganization\n\ndefense and appropriate for resolution by the trier of fact.  \n\n     2.   Evidence of \"Constructive Discharge\"\n                                             \n\n          The  defendants  nonetheless  urge  affirmance  on  the\n\nground that  Jirau did not  proffer sufficient evidence  that her\n\nreassignment was so onerous or intolerable as to be actionable as\n\na \"constructive discharge.\"  See Levy v. FDIC,  7 F.3d 1054, 1056\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir. 1993)  (appellate  court may  affirm  on any  adequate\n\nground, whether or  not raised  or addressed below).   We  reject\n\ntheir contention.1 \n\n          Defendants  contend  that   Jirau  should  be  strictly\n\nconfined to  establishing a \"constructive discharge,\"  a term she\n\nhas  used continually throughout the litigation.  Were we to hold\n\n                    \n\n     1The magistrate-judge's report notes that  Jirau's reassign-\nment  to a  nonsupervisory position  at reduced  salary  was \"not\nsufficient for a prima  facie showing of constructive discharge.\"\nThe  context  nevertheless  belies any  interpretation  that  the\nmagistrate judge purportedly assessed the adversity occasioned by\n                                                   \nthe challenged  employment action.   The quoted  statement culmi-\nnates  a lengthy  discussion on  the distinct  \"political animus\"\nelement  of the    1983  claim, see  supra Section  II.A.1, which\n                                          \ncites no  authority pertinent to  the \"adversity\" matter.   Thus,\nthe  district court did  not reach the  \"adverse employment deci-\nsion\" issue.\n\n                                7\n\nJirau  to the  rigid  nomenclature advocated  by defendants,  she\n\nwould have to demonstrate  the heightened constitutional \"injury\"\n\nwhich  victims  of  patronage  discrimination  were  required  to\n\nestablish  before our decision  in Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-\n                                                                 \n\nRoque, 889 F.2d  1209 (1st  Cir. 1989) (patronage  claims may  be\n     \n\nactionable  for employment  decisions short of  \"discharge\"), and\n\nthe  Supreme  Court's decision  in Rutan  v. Republican  Party of\n                                                                 \n\nIllinois,  497 U.S.  62 (1990)  (patronage  claims may  extend to\n        \n\nhiring, promotions,  transfers, and recalls).2   From the outset,\n\nhowever, Jirau simultaneously  characterized the challenged  1986\n\nemployment decision as a \"demotion,\" an adverse employment action\n\nimplicating  both the Agosto and Rutan  paradigms, and included a\n                                                      \n\ncopy of Rutan in her opposition to defendants' motion for summary\n             \n\njudgment.  The defendants therefore  cannot contend that they  or\n\nthe magistrate judge were not fairly alerted to the intendment of\n\nthe terms \"constructive discharge\"  and \"demotion.\"  Moreover, we\n\nhave been  particularly loathe to hold  First Amendment political\n\ndiscrimination claims  forfeit on such insubstantial  bases.  See\n                                                                 \n\nBalaguer-Santiago v. Torres-Gaztambide, 932 F.2d 1015, 1016  (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1991).   Finally,  the evidence  that Jirau  was transferred\n\nfrom a position with supervisory responsibility for more than 200\n\nemployees, to a nonsupervisory  position carrying a lower salary,\n\nsurely generated  a trialworthy  issue as to  whether defendants'\n\n                    \n\n     2Since the individual defendants have not asserted qualified\n                          \nimmunity, see Aviles-Martinez, 963  F.2d at 6 (pre-Agosto employ-\n                                                         \nment actions generally must  rise to the level of  \"discharge\" to\navert qualified immunity), we do not consider it. \n\n                                8\n\nadverse  employment decision  constituted an  actionable demotion\n\nunder  either Agosto or Rutan.  See Nereida-Gonzalez, 990 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n702-03,  706  (holding that  similar demotion  to nonsupervisory,\n\nlower-paying  position generated  triable issue);  Rivera-Ruiz v.\n                                                              \n\nGonzalez-Rivera, 983 F.2d 332, 334, 335 (1st Cir. 1993) (same). \n               \n\nB.   Fifth Amendment Claim:  Denial of Pre-demotion Hearing\n                                                           \n\n          Lastly,  Jirau insists that  her procedural due process\n\nclaim  was improperly  disallowed notwithstanding  competent evi-\n\ndence that she  was denied  a pre-demotion hearing  and that  her\n\nassistant directorship constituted a cognizable property interest\n\nunder Puerto Rico law.

See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (1993).

In 1982 she was appointed Assistant Director of the UPR Home Economics and Nutrition Program, a position which carried a higher salary and required her to supervise more than 200 UPR employees.  Following the 1984 general elections, which swept the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) into office throughout Puerto Rico, defendant Fernando Agrait was appointed UPR president, the first of several key UPR posts to be filled by prominent PDP members.  In August 1986 the UPR administration informed Jirau that her position as Assistant Director was to be abolished in an overall reorganization of the \"inefficient\" Agricultural Extension Service, and that henceforth Jirau would serve as a Specialist in Consumer Education, which neither entailed supervisory responsibility nor entitled her to the prerogatives (e.g., secretary, direct phone line) and salary associated with her former position.  Shortly after UPR formally abolished the position held by Jirau, Ms. Colon Hernandez, a known PDP member, was appointed to a newly-named position incorporating the identical job functions.  As part and parcel of the reorganization, UPR \"demoted\" five other employees, all NPP affiliates, and replaced them with PDP members.  Contemporaneously, during a conversation with one of the five demotees, defendant Hernandez Gaya stated that the new PDP administration \"had to select its own team, loyal to the ideology of the party in power.\"   As Jirau considered her \"demotion\" intolerable, she accepted early retirement in August 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jirau, and others similarly situated, sued UPR and the four individual administrators, alleging that the \"demotions\" were politically motivated in violation of their First Amendment rights, and had been effected without a pre-demotion hearing in violation of their procedural due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The plaintiffs sought declaratory and equitable (reinstatement) relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.  After settling with the other plaintiffs, defendants moved for summary judgment on both Jirau claims.  The district court ultimately adopted the report and recommendation of a magistrate judge, concluding that Jirau had neither generated a trialworthy issue as to whether defendants harbored a discriminatory animus, nor rebutted the nondiscriminatory motivation alleged by defendants.  Summary judgment entered for defendants, and Jirau appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>A. First Amendment Claim:  Politically Discriminatory Demotion</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Evidence of Discriminatory Animus</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jirau contends that the summary judgment must be set aside because the district court ignored or discounted evidence sufficient to generate a trialworthy issue as to whether the defendants harbored a discriminatory animus.  We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, under the same standards incumbent on the district court, to determine whether \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  Velez-Gomez v. SMA Life Assurance Co., 8 F.3d 873, 874-75 (1st Cir.1993).  We view the record evidence, and draw all fair inferences, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff asserting a political discrimination claim under the First Amendment bears the preliminary burden of producing competent direct or circumstantial evidence that political affiliation played a \"substantial\" role in the adverse employment decision.  Ferrer v. Zayas, 914 F.2d 309, 311 (1st Cir.1990).  See Anthony v. Sundlun, 952 F.2d 603, 605 (1st Cir.1991).  The district court aptly observed that mere evidence that Jirau had been \"demoted\"--by reassignment to a nonsupervisory position at reduced salary--was insufficient evidence of discriminatory animus, because it is entirely consistent with defendants' \"reorganization\" defense.  However, Jirau proffered other circumstantial evidence probative of possible discriminatory motivation:  (1) all defendants were known PDP members, while Jirau and all her fellow demotees were members of the opposition NPP, see, e.g., Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir.1993);  Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir.1993);  Kercado-Melendez v. Aponte-Roque, 829 F.2d 255, 264 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1044, 108 S.Ct. 2037, 100 L.Ed.2d 621 (1988);  and (2) plaintiffs' previous positions, though formally abolished, were promptly reconstituted under different titles and filled by known PDP members, see, e.g., Rodriguez-Pinto, 982 F.2d at 40.   Most importantly, however, Jirau proffered direct evidence of a discriminatory motivation:  the affidavit attesting to defendant Hernandez Gaya's statement that the UPR administration \"had to select its own team, loyal to the ideology of the party in power.\"   E.g., Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at 69-70 n. 6 (defendant allegedly told plaintiff that she was \"not a person of trust\");  Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 706 (1st Cir.1993) (defendants told plaintiff \"outright\" she would be demoted because of her NPP affiliation);  Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig, 963 F.2d 2, 6-7 (1st Cir.1992) (defendant asked plaintiff whether he had met with NPP members).  Assuming its truth, as we must on summary judgment, see Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 877, this affidavit satisfied the threshold burden of proof incumbent on Jirau for present purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate-judge's reliance on Jirau's failure to rebut the reorganization defense was flawed.  First Amendment political discrimination claims are not subject to the Title VII burden-shifting device.  Whereas a Title VII claimant retains the burden of proof throughout, even after the burden of limited production has shifted to the Title VII defendant to assert a nondiscriminatory motivation for the challenged action, in the First Amendment context Jirau successfully foisted the burden of proof onto these defendants simply by meeting her own threshold burden of persuasion.  See Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at 66-67 (contrasting Burdine and Mt. Healthy \"burden shifting\").  Defendants were required to establish the absence of a trialworthy dispute as to whether \"efficiency\" was their only motivation for the Jirau demotion.  Summary judgment would have been warranted, in other words, only if defendants' evidentiary proffer compelled the finding that political discrimination did not constitute a \"but for\" cause for the demotion.  See id. at 68.   Since the affidavit directly evidenced a discriminatory animus at odds with their reorganization defense, and required credibility determinations appropriate to the trier of fact, defendants were not entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, though Jirau was not required to meet the reorganization defense in order to avert summary judgment, she did so.  Notwithstanding defendants' proffer that the Agricultural Extension Service and its directors had proven \"inefficient,\" Jirau countered with several affidavits from former UPR officials attesting to her efficiency, as well as the efficiency of her co-workers and department.  See id. at 71 (evidence that plaintiff efficiently performed job may rebut reorganization defense) (citing cases).  Thus, Jirau's \"rebuttal\" evidence likewise generated a credibility dispute critical to the reorganization defense and appropriate for resolution by the trier of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Evidence of \"Constructive Discharge\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants nonetheless urge affirmance on the ground that Jirau did not proffer sufficient evidence that her reassignment was so onerous or intolerable as to be actionable as a \"constructive discharge.\"   See Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir.1993) (appellate court may affirm on any adequate ground, whether or not raised or addressed below).  We reject their contention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that Jirau should be strictly confined to establishing a \"constructive discharge,\" a term she has used continually throughout the litigation.  Were we to hold Jirau to the rigid nomenclature advocated by defendants, she would have to demonstrate the heightened constitutional \"injury\" which victims of patronage discrimination were required to establish before our decision in Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209 (1st Cir.1989) (patronage claims may be actionable for employment decisions short of \"discharge\"), and the Supreme Court's decision in Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois, 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990) (patronage claims may extend to hiring, promotions, transfers, and recalls).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  From the outset, however, Jirau simultaneously characterized the challenged 1986 employment decision as a \"demotion,\" an adverse employment action implicating both the Agosto and Rutan paradigms, and included a copy of Rutan in her opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The defendants therefore cannot contend that they or the magistrate judge were not fairly alerted to the intendment of the terms \"constructive discharge\" and \"demotion.\"   Moreover, we have been particularly loathe to hold First Amendment political discrimination claims forfeit on such insubstantial bases.  See Balaguer-Santiago v. Torres-Gaztambide, 932 F.2d 1015, 1016 (1st Cir.1991).  Finally, the evidence that Jirau was transferred from a position with supervisory responsibility for more than 200 employees, to a nonsupervisory position carrying a lower salary, surely generated a trialworthy issue as to whether defendants' adverse employment decision constituted an actionable demotion under either Agosto or Rutan.   See Nereida-Gonzalez, 990 F.2d at 702-03, 706 (holding that similar demotion to nonsupervisory, lower-paying position generated triable issue);  Rivera-Ruiz v. Gonzalez-Rivera, 983 F.2d 332, 334, 335 (1st Cir.1993) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>B. Fifth Amendment Claim:  Denial of Pre-demotion Hearing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Jirau insists that her procedural due process claim was improperly disallowed notwithstanding competent evidence that she was denied a pre-demotion hearing and that her assistant directorship constituted a cognizable property interest under Puerto Rico law.  See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 538, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1491, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate-judge's report and recommendation apparently assumed, incorrectly, that what was perceived as a failure on Jirau's part to adduce sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus would warrant dismissal of her due process claim as well.  Jirau would be entitled to a pre-demotion hearing were she to establish that she held a \"property right\" to her assistant directorship position, see Cotnoir v. University of Maine Systs., 35 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1994), an issue not reached by the district court.  We therefore vacate the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings on the due process claim as well.  See Nereida-Gonzalez, 990 F.2d at 706-07.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The magistrate-judge's report notes that Jirau's reassignment to a nonsupervisory position at reduced salary was \"not sufficient for a prima facie showing of constructive discharge.\"   The context nevertheless belies any interpretation that the magistrate judge purportedly assessed the adversity occasioned by the challenged employment action.  The quoted statement culminates a lengthy discussion on the distinct \"political animus\" element of the Sec. 1983 claim, see supra Section II.A.1, which cites no authority pertinent to the \"adversity\" matter.

Most importantly, however, Jirau proffered direct evidence of a discriminatory motivation:  the affidavit attesting to defendant Hernandez Gaya's statement that the UPR administration \"had to select its own team, loyal to the ideology of the party in power.\"   E.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627336\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Acevedo-Diaz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/627336/franco-acevedo-diaz-v-jose-e-aponte-ada-n-perez-franco-acevedo-diaz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">69-70</span> </a></span>n. 6 (defendant allegedly told plaintiff that she was \"not a person of trust\");  Nereida-Gonzalez v.

Assuming its truth, as we must on summary judgment, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195013\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Velez-Gomez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195013/velez-gomez-v-sma-life-assurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span>, this affidavit satisfied the threshold burden of proof incumbent on Jirau for present purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate-judge's reliance on Jirau's failure to rebut the reorganization defense was flawed.  First Amendment political discrimination claims are not subject to the Title VII burden-shifting device.  Whereas a Title VII claimant retains the burden of proof throughout, even after the burden of limited production has shifted to the Title VII defendant to assert a nondiscriminatory motivation for the challenged action, in the First Amendment context Jirau successfully foisted the burden of proof onto these defendants simply by meeting her own threshold burden of persuasion.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627336\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Acevedo-Diaz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/627336/franco-acevedo-diaz-v-jose-e-aponte-ada-n-perez-franco-acevedo-diaz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">66-67</span> </a></span>(contrasting Burdine and Mt. Healthy \"burden shifting\").  Defendants were required to establish the absence of a trialworthy dispute as to whether \"efficiency\" was their only motivation for the Jirau demotion.  Summary judgment would have been warranted, in other words, only if defendants' evidentiary proffer compelled the finding that political discrimination did not constitute a \"but for\" cause for the demotion.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627336\"><a href=\"/opinion/627336/franco-acevedo-diaz-v-jose-e-aponte-ada-n-perez-franco-acevedo-diaz-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 68. </a></span>  Since the affidavit directly evidenced a discriminatory animus at odds with their reorganization defense, and required credibility determinations appropriate to the trier of fact, defendants were not entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, though Jirau was not required to meet the reorganization defense in order to avert summary judgment, she did so.  Notwithstanding defendants' proffer that the Agricultural Extension Service and its directors had proven \"inefficient,\" Jirau countered with several affidavits from former UPR officials attesting to her efficiency, as well as the efficiency of her co-workers and department.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627336\"><a href=\"/opinion/627336/franco-acevedo-diaz-v-jose-e-aponte-ada-n-perez-franco-acevedo-diaz-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 71 </a></span>(evidence that plaintiff efficiently performed job may rebut reorganization defense) (citing cases).  Thus, Jirau's \"rebuttal\" evidence likewise generated a credibility dispute critical to the reorganization defense and appropriate for resolution by the trier of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194983\"><a href=\"/opinion/194983/levy-v-weinhold/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span>, 1056 (1st Cir.1993) (appellate court may affirm on any adequate ground, whether or not raised or addressed below).  We reject their contention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that Jirau should be strictly confined to establishing a \"constructive discharge,\" a term she has used continually throughout the litigation.  Were we to hold Jirau to the rigid nomenclature advocated by defendants, she would have to demonstrate the heightened constitutional \"injury\" which victims of patronage discrimination were required to establish before our decision in Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532523\"><a href=\"/opinion/532523/maria-m-agosto-de-feliciano-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc-maria-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1989) (patronage claims may be actionable for employment decisions short of \"discharge\"), and the Supreme Court's decision in Rutan v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span> </a></span>(1990) (patronage claims may extend to hiring, promotions, transfers, and recalls).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  From the outset, however, Jirau simultaneously characterized the challenged 1986 employment decision as a \"demotion,\" an adverse employment action implicating both the Agosto and Rutan paradigms, and included a copy of Rutan in her opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The defendants therefore cannot contend that they or the magistrate judge were not fairly alerted to the intendment of the terms \"constructive discharge\" and \"demotion.\"   Moreover, we have been particularly loathe to hold First Amendment political discrimination claims forfeit on such insubstantial bases.  See Balaguer-Santiago v. Torres-Gaztambide, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561141\"><a href=\"/opinion/561141/rafael-l-balaguer-santiago-v-hon-jaime-torres-gaztambide-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span>, 1016 (1st Cir.1991).  Finally, the evidence that Jirau was transferred from a position with supervisory responsibility for more than 200 employees, to a nonsupervisory position carrying a lower salary, surely generated a trialworthy issue as to whether defendants' adverse employment decision constituted an actionable demotion under either Agosto or Rutan.   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604127\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Nereida-Gonzalez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/604127/carmen-nereida-gonzalez-v-cirilo-tirado-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">702-03</span></a></span>, 706 (holding that similar demotion to nonsupervisory, lower-paying position generated triable issue);  Rivera-Ruiz v.

See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.

We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate-judge's report and recommendation apparently assumed, incorrectly, that what was perceived as a failure on Jirau's part to adduce sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus would warrant dismissal of her due process claim as well.  Jirau would be entitled to a pre-demotion hearing were she to establish that she held a \"property right\" to her assistant directorship position, see Cotnoir v. University of Maine Systs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195596\"><a href=\"/opinion/195596/cotnoir-v-university-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1994), an issue not reached by the district court.  We therefore vacate the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings on the due process claim as well.
