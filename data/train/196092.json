Plaintiff  contends  that deliberate\r                                 \r\n\nindifference is established by his uncontradicted allegations\r\n\nthat  (1)  he  advised   defendant  a  Minnesota  doctor  had\r\n\nsuccessfully  prescribed  Triamcinolone for  plaintiff's skin\r\n\ncondition after  hydrocortisone had worsened the problem, (2)\r\n\nhe  urged defendant to review the  Minnesota records, (3) but\r\n\ndefendant refused to check  the record and instead prescribed\r\n\nhydrocortisone,  which,  once again,  exacerbated plaintiff's\r\n\nskin condition.  \r\n\n          We  agree with  the  magistrate judge  and district\r\n\ncourt that  plaintiff failed  to raise any  genuine issue  of\r\n\nmaterial   fact  for   trial.     Defendant's  uncontradicted\r\n\naffidavit stated that  both Triamcinolone and  hydrocortisone\r\n\nare used to treat skin  conditions like plaintiff's, but that\r\n\nTriamcinolone,  while  stronger,  has  more   risk  for  side\r\n\neffects.  Because defendant, a physician's assistant, did not\r\n\nfeel  comfortable  prescribing  Triamcinolone,   she  advised\r\n\nplaintiff  to see a doctor.  Plaintiff eventually did see the\r\n\ndoctor,  who  prescribed   Triamcinolone,  which   alleviated\r\n\nplaintiff's problem.   Plaintiff acknowledged below  that his\r\n\nskin  problems would come and  go and that  defendant was not\r\n\nresponsible   for   the  delay   in  scheduling   a  doctor's\r\n\nappointment.     Rather,  plaintiff's   contention  was  that\r\n\ndefendant's   refusal  to   heed  plaintiff's   warning  that\r\n\nhydrocortisone had exacerbated  a past flare  up or to  check\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthe medical record and ascertain that a doctor had previously\r\n\nprescribed  Triamcinolone successfully  manifested deliberate\r\n\nindifference to plaintiff's medical needs.  \r\n\n          We  disagree.  Neither defendant's failure to check\r\n\nplaintiff's  record   before  treating  his  eczema  nor  her\r\n\nknowledge  that  hydrocortisone  had  failed  on  a  previous\r\n\noccasion  shows deliberate indifference to plaintiff's needs.\r\n\nAt best, there was a disagreement among medical professionals\r\n\nas to the course of treatment.  Such  a disagreement does not\r\n\nrise  to the level of a constitutional violation.  See Watson\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Defendant  did not  bar\r\n\nplaintiff from a  remedy which  had worked in  the past;  she\r\n\ntold him to consult the prison  doctor.  The referral was not\r\n\na  refusal to treat plaintiff,  but rather a  further step in\r\n\nthe management  of plaintiff's problem.   That several months\r\n\nelapsed  before plaintiff  actually  saw the  doctor was  not\r\n\ndefendant's fault, as plaintiff acknowledged below.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
