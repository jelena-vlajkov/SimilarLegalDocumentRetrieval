Pro  se  plaintiff William  Ferguson\n                                \n\nappeals a  district court  judgment that dismissed  his civil\n\nrights complaint as frivolous  under 28 U.S.C.  1915(d).   We\n\nhave thoroughly  reviewed the record and  Ferguson's brief on\n\nappeal.   We  agree that  this case  is wholly  frivolous and\n\naffirm the judgment  for the reasons  stated in the  district\n      \n\ncourt's memorandum and order.  See Local Rule 27.1.\n                                  \n",
