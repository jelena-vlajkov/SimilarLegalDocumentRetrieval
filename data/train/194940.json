Seeley on brief pro se.\n                \nA. John Pappalardo,  United States  Attorney, and Brian T.  Kelly,\n                                                                 \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.      Appellant challenges  the district\n                    \n\ncourt's  disposition of his motion under 28 U.S.C.   2255 and\n\nformer Rule  35(a), Federal  Rules of Criminal  Procedure, to\n\ncorrect, modify or clarify his sentence.  The district  court\n\nvacated appellant's  conviction on two counts  which it found\n\nto be impermissibly repetitious of the remaining convictions,\n\nbut  left unchanged  the  total punishment  time.   Appellant\n\ncomplains that  \"more  is owed  to  [him] than  the  symbolic\n\nemptiness   provided.\"    We   affirm  the  district  judge's\n\ndisposition for  substantially the same reasons  as set forth\n\nin her opinion.  \n\n          In  his  notice  of appeal,  appellant  assigned as\n\nerror the district court's reliance on Judge Keeton's opinion\n\nin United  States v. MacPherson,  CR 87-34-K (May  10, 1991),\n                               \n\naff'd,  959  F.2d  230   (1st  Cir.  1992)  (table),  calling\n     \n\nMacPherson  an \"obscure . .  . unpublished case not available\n          \n\nto  the public.\"    There  was  no  error  in  the  citation.\n\nMacPherson  involved one  of appellant's  codefendants, tried\n          \n\nseparately but charged in the same indictment.  The issues in\n\nJudge Keeton's  opinion were directly related  to those here.\n\nSee Loc.  R. 36.2(b)6 (stipulating that  unpublished opinions\n   \n\nmay be cited in related cases).  Moreover, the argument calls\n\ninto  question appellant's  good  faith.   In his  memorandum\n\nbelow, appellant appended a  copy of the MacPherson decision,\n                                                   \n\nand urged the district court to follow its reasoning.\n\n          Appellant also attempts  on this  appeal to  attack\n\nhis conviction  and sentence on two  new grounds.   We do not\n\nconsider issues raised for the first time on appeal, unless a\n\ngross miscarriage of justice would otherwise occur or the new\n\nground is  so compelling as \"virtually  to assure appellant's\n\nsuccess.\"   Hernandez-Hernandez  v. United  States, 904  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n758, 763 (1st Cir. 1990).  \n\n          Appellant's new arguments fall well outside of this\n\nnarrow exception.  First, he challenges as unreliable hearsay\n\ncertain testimony at his  trial.  We previously  rejected the\n\nvery  same  challenge  on  direct appeal,  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nSeeley, 892  F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st  Cir. 1989), so it  will not be\n      \n\nreviewed again on a   2255 motion.  Barrett v. United States,\n                                                            \n\n965 F.2d 1184, 1190 (1st Cir. 1992).  \n\n          Second, appellant argues  that the trial judge  was\n\nbiased,  leading   her   to  impose   a   sentence   \"grossly\n\ndisproportionate\"   to  the   sentencing  guidelines.     The\n\nguidelines  were not  in  effect on  the  date appellant  was\n\nsentenced and we have held squarely that, in a pre-guidelines\n\ncase, the sentencing judge has plenary authority to treat the\n\nguidelines as  extraneous surplusage.   See United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nTwomey, 845 F.2d 1132, 1134-35 (1st  Cir. 1988).  He cites no\n      \n\nprobative evidence for  the claim of bias,  but uses snippets\n\nof public information to conjure up a personal profile of the\n\njudge that is as irrelevant as  it is unfounded.  See Blizard\n                                                             \n\n                             -3-\n\nv. Frechette, 601 F.2d 1217, 1221 (1st Cir. 1979) (there must\n            \n\nbe some reasonable factual basis to doubt the impartiality of\n\nthe tribunal).  \n\n          For  the  reasons  stated  the  judgment  below  is\n\naffirmed.\n         \n\n                             -4-\n",
