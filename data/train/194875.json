Kenneth Colon, an  attorney,\n                             \n\nappeals  a $500  sanction  that the  district court  imposed\n\nafter  finding that he had  violated Rule 11  of the Federal\n\nRules of  Civil Procedure.    The district  court based  the\n\nsanction upon a motion  that Colon signed, on behalf  of the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, which asked the court to reduce\n\nthe compensation paid  to a special master.  After reviewing\n\nthe  motion and the record, we find no violation of Rule 11.\n\nWe conclude that the  sanction is without basis in  law, and\n\nreverse the order imposing it.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          The  sanction  arose  in  the  context of  lengthy\n\nlitigation seeking  to reform  part of Puerto  Rico's mental\n\nhealth system.  See, e.g., Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon,\n                                                           \n\n956 F.2d 348 (1st Cir. 1992).  In 1974, a  group of patients\n\nat Rio Piedras Hospital filed suit, claiming that conditions\n\nthere  violated  the federal  Constitution.    In 1977,  the\n\ndistrict  court entered  a Stipulation,  agreed upon  by the\n\nparties, which  prescribes  reforms and  sets standards  for\n\ncare and treatment.  In 1985, the district court appointed a\n\nSpecial Master  who, assisted  by  a staff,  was to  monitor\n\ncompliance  with the  Stipulation.   In  1987, the  district\n\ncourt  began to  interpret  the Stipulation  as applying  to\n\nother hospitals  in Puerto  Rico (at least  insofar as  they\n\ntreated patients transferred from Rio Piedras).  The Special\n\nMaster  began  to  monitor  treatment  conditions  and  seek\n\ncompliance  with the  Stipulation  at, at  least, one  other\n\nhospital.  \n\n          In late 1991, this court held that the Stipulation\n\napplied  only to conditions  at Rio Piedras;  in the court's\n\nview,  the  parties  had   not  agreed  to  its  application\n\nelsewhere.  Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 951 F.2d 1325,\n                                            \n\n1346 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Navarro I\"). The court's opinion also\n                                \n\nobserved that  Rio Piedras  Hospital seemed  to be  close to\n\nachieving full compliance with the Stipulation's conditions.\n\nId. at 1329  n.3.  About one  month later, in  January 1992,\n   \n\nthe district  court reappointed the Special  Master, and his\n\nmonitoring staff, to serve until the end of the year.\n\n          In  February  1992,  the  Commonwealth  filed  the\n\nmotion,  signed by  attorney Colon,  that is the  subject of\n\nthis  appeal.    The  motion  asked the  district  court  to\n\nreconsider its  January  1992 reappointment  of the  Special\n\nMaster,  to   reduce  the  length   of  the  term   of  that\n\nreappointment, to reduce the  level of compensation paid the\n\nMaster and his staff, and to relieve the Commonwealth of the\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nburden of paying for  a year's worth of  monitoring services\n\nin advance.  After considering and rejecting the motion, the\n\ndistrict court decided that its signer had violated Rule 11.\n\nThe  district  court  ordered  a  sanction  of  $500.    The\n\nsanctioned attorney, Kenneth Colon, now appeals.\n\n                             II\n\n                Review of the Sanction Order\n                                            \n\n          Under  Rule 11  (in relevant part),  an attorney's\n\nsignature on a motion  paper certifies that \"to the  best of\n\nthe signer's knowledge, information  and belief formed after\n\nreasonable inquiry,  [the motion]  is well grounded  in fact\n\nand  is warranted by existing  law or a  good faith argument\n\nfor the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law\n\n. . .\"   Fed. R. Civ.  P. 11.  The  district court concluded\n\nthat the signer of the motion paper  before us failed in his\n\nduty  to undertake  reasonable inquiry.   In  reviewing that\n\nholding,  we  must  take  account of  that  court's  greater\n\nfamiliarity with  relevant context, and \"apply  an abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion standard.\"  Cooter &amp; Gell  v. Hartmarx Corp., 496\n                                                       \n\nU.S.  384, 399  (1990).   See  also  Muthig v.  Brant  Point\n                                                            \n\nNantucket,  Inc.,  838  F.2d   600,  603  (1st  Cir.  1988).\n                \n\nApplying that standard,  we have found  no lawful basis  for\n\napplying a sanction in this case.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          The reader can most easily understand why we reach\n\nthis conclusion  by examining attorney Colon's motion paper,\n\nattached to this  opinion as an Appendix.   Just what  is it\n\nabout this paper, one might rightly ask, that would  violate\n\nRule 11?  The  document makes three  requests.   First,  the\n\nmotion  asks the  district  court to  reappoint the  Special\n\nMaster to a  term shorter than  an additional (nearly)  full\n\nyear.   It relies on the fact that our then-recent Navarro I\n                                                            \n\nopinion  both   1)  limited   the  Stipulation's  scope   to\n\nconditions at Rio Piedras  Hospital, and 2) referred  to Rio\n\nPiedras' conditions  as close  to compliance.   In light  of\n\nthose reasons,  the motion asserts that  the Master's duties\n\nunder the Stipulation  may be less  extensive in the  coming\n\nyear than the  district court had previously  thought.  And,\n\nit  claims   that  the   parties'   briefs  discussing   the\n\nimplications of Navarro I  (scheduled for submission in mid-\n                         \n\nMarch) would clarify the more limited scope  of those future\n\nduties.\n\n          Second, the motion asks  the district court not to\n\nrequire  the Commonwealth  to \"prepay[]\"  a year's  worth of\n\nmonitoring services,  for such payment  would be \"premature\"\n\ngiven  that \"the need for  and extent of  these services has\n\nnot been defined.\"  It adds that there \"is no reason why the\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nrequired  monitoring  services cannot  be  compensated after\n        \n\ntheir  performance .  . . .\"   As  authority, it  cites Rule\n\n53(a) of the  Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, which gives\n\nfederal  courts  broad  authority  to  structure  a  special\n\nmaster's  compensation.     See   Fed.  R.  Civ.   P.  53(a)\n                               \n\n(compensation shall be paid \"as the court may direct\").\n\n          Third,   the   motion   opposes   the   rates   of\n\ncompensation for the Special Master  and staff set forth  in\n\nthe court-approved  budget.  The  motion, in an  Appendix A,\n\npresents   a  chart   which  says,   in  effect,   that  the\n\nCommonwealth  compensates  its  judges,   inferior  judicial\n\nofficers, and comparable health care personnel at much lower\n\nrates of  pay.  And the motion,  in referring to Rule 53(a),\n\nmakes clear that  the district court has  wide discretion to\n\nset the proper amount of compensation.   See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n                                            \n\n53(a) (compensation \"shall be fixed by the court\").\n\n          The  district  court  based its  Rule  11  finding\n\nprimarily  upon  the  motion's  third   request,  seeking  a\n\nreduction   in  compensation.     The  January   1992  order\n\nreappointing the Special Master provided for compensation at\n\nthe following hourly rates:\n\n          Special Master              $100.00 \n          Special Master's assistant    30.00\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n          Psychiatrist                  75.00\n          Psychologist                  75.00\n          Social worker                 60.00\n          Occupational therapist        25.00\n          Quality assurance director    25.00\n\nThe  appellant's  motion in  opposition  set  forth (in  its\n\nAppendix A) a different  and much lower set of  hourly rates\n\nat   which,  it  said,   the  Commonwealth  paid  comparable\n\nemployees:\n\n          Superior Court judge          $27.00\n          Superior Court law clerk       10.00\n          Psychiatrist                   11.20\n          Psychologist                   11.20\n          Social worker                   9.80\n          Occupational therapist          7.90\n          Quality assurance director      7.90\n\nThe district  court took objection to  this latter schedule.\n\nThe  court said that this  schedule did not  reflect the pay\n                                           \n\nthat many  health care professionals  in the  Commonwealth's\n\nemploy actually receive.  The court said further  that Colon\n\nhad  failed to make a  reasonable prefiling inquiry into the\n                                                   \n\nactual pay of such  professionals before suggesting Appendix\n\nA's pay  scales, which  were \"drastically below  the staff's\n\ncurrent  rates.\"   These  suggested  pay  scales, the  court\n\nadded, were  \"insulting to the professionals  on the Special\n\nMaster's staff.\"  \n\n          In  our  view, the  record  does  not support  the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that  Rule 11 required  attorney\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nColon to make a further inquiry.   For one thing, the object\n\nof  Rule 11's inquiry  requirement is to  avoid filings that\n\nare baseless.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11  (signature certifies\n                  \n\nthat \"to the  best of the  signer's knowledge  . . .  formed\n\nafter reasonable  inquiry, [the motion] is  well grounded in\n                                                            \n\nfact and  is warranted\" by  law) (emphasis added);  Cooter &amp;\n                                                            \n\nGell, 496 U.S. at 393 (\"the central purpose of Rule 11 is to\n    \n\ndeter  baseless  filings\").    Here, the  inquiry  that  the\n\ndistrict court believed the appellant should have made would\n\nnot  have  shown the  motion  to be  baseless  (i.e. legally\n   \n\nunwarranted,  or without  adequate factual  grounding).   It\n\nwould   simply  have   weakened,  without   destroying,  the\n                               \n\nCommonwealth's argument. \n\n          More specifically, the inquiry would have shown 1)\n\nthat the motion's Appendix A accurately reflects an official\n\nCommonwealth pay scale, set by its central personnel agency,\n\nfor  permanent health  care professionals,  but 2)  that the\n              \n\nCommonwealth   hires  many   (perhaps   most)  health   care\n\nprofessionals, not as permanent employees, but under special\n\ncontractual arrangements at higher rates.   In light of that\n\nshowing,  the   Commonwealth  might  have   found  it   more\n\ndifficult, but not  at all impossible,  to proceed with  its\n\nclaim for  lower compensation  on the  basis of  Appendix A.\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nThe  legal standards  governing special  master compensation\n\nleave much to the district court's discretion.  Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.  53(a).   And, an  effort to  tie the Special  Master and\n\nstaffs'  compensation more directly to judicial compensation\n\nand   to   an   \"official\"   (though   frequently   skirted)\n\nCommonwealth pay scale is plausible, and within the realm of\n\nreasonable argument, even if that argument eventually  would\n\nnot  carry the day.  Cf. Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 259\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 101, 105 (1922)  (special master's compensation  should\n\nbe  \"liberal, but  not exorbitant\";  salaries \"for  judicial\n\nofficers performing similar duties are valuable guides,\" but\n\na \"higher rate of compensation is generally necessary\"). \n\n          For  another thing, the  motion paper's failure to\n\nset  forth  a  more  complete account  of  Commonwealth  pay\n\npractices did not  impose significant additional  costs upon\n\nthe opposing party. See, e.g., Unioil, Inc. v. E.F. Hutton &amp;\n                                                            \n\nCo.,  809 F.2d 548, 557 (9th Cir. 1986) (cost of foreseeable\n   \n\nresponse by  opposing parties relevant for  determining what\n\nconstitutes reasonable inquiry), cert. denied,  484 U.S. 822\n                                             \n\n(1987);  Jerold  S.  Solovy  et al.,  Sanctions  in  Federal\n                                                            \n\nLitigation    2.04 at  2-18 (1991)  (magnitude of  burden in\n          \n\nresponding to filing  affects thoroughness of  investigation\n\nthat must  be performed).   That party, the  Special Master,\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nand the Master's staff, all had ready access to the relevant\n\ncompensation-related facts and quickly  brought them to  the\n\ncourt's attention.   Of  course, presenting these  facts did\n\ncost the opposing party  some time and effort.  But  Rule 11\n\nnormally  does not require one  party to uncover  and to set\n\nforth the facts that support the other side's  position. Cf.\n                                                            \n\nContinental Air  Lines, Inc. v.  Group Systems International\n                                                            \n\nFar East, Ltd., 109  F.R.D. 594, 598 (C.D.

We emphasize the word  \"significant\"\n\nbecause  the district  court  found one  sentence  literally\n\nfalse.  That sentence  says that the \"rates of pay\"  for the\n\nMaster's  staff \"outpace by a factor of  6 or more to 1, the\n\nrates of  pay  of their  counterparts in  the Public  Health\n\nSystem.\"  This statement is not literally false, if one uses\n\nthe  \"official\"  pay  scale  for permanent  employees  as  a\n\ncomparison;  in  light of  actual  pay  practices, we  would\n\ncharacterize   it   as    \"overstatement\"   or    \"one-sided\n\ncharacterization.\"   But were  it  literally inaccurate,  it\n\nwould   not  matter,   for   Rule   11   neither   penalizes\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\noverstatement  nor authorizes  an overly literal  reading of\n\neach  factual  statement.

[A]t\n\nsome level of analysis,  every unsuccessful litigation paper\n\ncontains an unsupported allegation or flawed argument\").    \n\n          The   district   court   provided  several   other\n\njustifications for  its sanctions.   It said that  Colon, in\n\nthe  motion  paper,  (1)  should  not  have  used  the  word\n\n\"bilking,\"  (2)   should  not   have  called   the  payments\n\n\"burdensome\" without first investigating the actual \"effects\n\nof these payments on the Department of Health's budget,\" (3)\n\nshould  not have said the litigation was in the \"final stage\n\nof proceedings\" without asking government officials \"if full\n\ncompliance  and an  end to this  case were in  fact close at\n\nhand,\" and (4) should not have asked to change the budgeting\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nprocess without  first finding  out \"how the  Special Master\n\nhad been paid in the past.\"  \n\n          In our view, these  circumstances do not justify a\n\nRule  11  sanction,  whether considered  separately  or  all\n\ntogether.    (1)  We  concede that  the  word  \"bilking\"  is\n\npejorative and,  insofar  as it  implies  cheating,  without\n\njustification.    We also  concede  the  obvious point  that\n\nargument  made to a  judge is more  appropriate (and usually\n\nworks better)  without pejoratives.  But to find support for\n\na  Rule 11 sanction in  appellant's use of  a single, rather\n\nmild  (albeit  unjustified)  pejorative,   is  to  impose  a\n\nstandard  of perfection  that  few lawyers  or judges  would\n\nmeet.    We  are  not  aware  of  any  reason  or  authority\n\nsuggesting that Rule 11 imposes such a standard.   \n\n          (2)   The  motion  paper  does  call  the  Special\n\nMaster's  budget \"burdensome,\"  but  we  do  not  understand\n\nwhere,  or how, Rule 11 forbids such a characterization.  No\n\none disputes that the  total amount of the Special  Master's\n\ncourt-approved budget  is $171,000.   Nothing in  the record\n\nsuggests   that   the   Commonwealth   found   this   amount\n\ninsignificant;  nor  do  we  understand  either  how further\n\nconsultation   with  government  officials  would  have  led\n\nattorney Colon  to change  the characterization, or  how the\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nuse of  the word \"burdensome\" made  a significant difference\n\nto the litigation.\n\n          (3) Neither do we understand  how, or why, Rule 11\n\nwould forbid  attorney Colon to characterize  the litigation\n\nas  in  the \"final  stage of  proceeding.\"   Our  opinion in\n\nNavarro I  curtailed the scope  of the Stipulation  and also\n         \n\nobserved that \"conditions\"  at Rio Piedras may be \"largely .\n\n.  . in compliance.\"   The motion paper  made clear that the\n\nCommonwealth  would soon  file a  brief arguing in  favor of\n\nsignificantly  limiting  the  Special   Master's  monitoring\n\nactivity.    Thus  the  statement  seems  to  amount  to  an\n\nargument, reasonable  in its  context, that might,  or might\n\nnot, help convince a court.  The record does not  make clear\n\nhow  further   \"inquiry\"   or  further   consultation   with\n\ngovernment officials  would have shown the  argument to have\n\nlacked adequate \"ground[ing] in fact.\" \n\n          (4)  We agree  with  the district  court that  the\n\nmotion  paper, in  requesting that  \"monitoring services  be\n\ncompensated after their performance,\" does  not take account\n\nof the fact  that the current budgeting system  provided for\n\ndisbursement of  budget funds  (on a  monthly basis)  to the\n\nSpecial   Master   only   after   he   performed   services.\n                               \n\nNonetheless,  we  do  not  see  how  the  motion's  possible\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nmisstatement can justify  a sanction.   Read fairly, and  in\n\ncontext, the paper's request indicates that the Commonwealth\n\nobjected  to  having  to  budget   for  a  year's  worth  of\n\nmonitoring  services in  advance, a  portion of  which might\n                                \n\nturn  out to have been  unnecessary.  At  worst, the paper's\n\nstatement  reflects a minor,  technical confusion  about the\n\nbudgeting process, and one  which apparently caused no harm.\n\n(After all, the opposing party, the Special  Master, and the\n\ncourt,  all  understood,  and  could  readily  explain,  how\n\ncurrent budgeting  worked.)   See Forrest  Creek Associates,\n                                                            \n\nLtd.,  831 F.2d at 1244-45; Joseph, Sanctions   9(D) at 133-\n                                             \n\n34. \n\n          In sum,  the district  court, at most,  could have\n\nfound a  few isolated  instances  of noncritical  statements\n\nthat further inquiry  might have shown  to be inaccurate  or\n\noverstated.  That further inquiry  would not have shown  the\n\nmotion's requests  to have been  baseless.  And,  failure to\n\nmake that inquiry  did not  unfairly impose  upon the  other\n\nparty some  special litigation  cost or burden.   This  case\n\ndiffers significantly from the kinds  of cases in which this\n\ncourt has upheld  a district court's  imposition of Rule  11\n\nsanctions.   Cf.

The district court based the sanction upon a motion that Colon signed, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which asked the court to reduce the compensation paid to a special master.  After reviewing the motion and the record, we find no violation of Rule 11.  We conclude that the sanction is without basis in law, and reverse the order imposing it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sanction arose in the context of lengthy litigation seeking to reform part of Puerto Rico's mental health system.  See, e.g., Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 956 F.2d 348 (1st Cir.1992).  In 1974, a group of patients at Rio Piedras Hospital filed suit, claiming that conditions there violated the federal Constitution.  In 1977, the district court entered a Stipulation, agreed upon by the parties, which prescribes reforms and sets standards for care and treatment.  In 1985, the district court appointed a Special Master who, assisted by a staff, was to monitor compliance with the Stipulation.  In 1987, the district court began to interpret the Stipulation as applying to other hospitals in Puerto Rico (at least insofar as they treated patients transferred from Rio Piedras).  The Special Master began to monitor treatment conditions and seek compliance with the Stipulation at, at least, one other hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1991, this court held that the Stipulation applied only to conditions at Rio Piedras;  in the court's view, the parties had not agreed to its application elsewhere.  Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 951 F.2d 1325, 1346 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Navarro I \").   The court's opinion also observed that Rio Piedras Hospital seemed to be close to achieving full compliance with the Stipulation's conditions.  Id. at 1329 n. 3.   About one month later, in January 1992, the district court reappointed the Special Master, and his monitoring staff, to serve until the end of the year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1992, the Commonwealth filed the motion, signed by attorney Colon, that is the subject of this appeal.  The motion asked the district court to reconsider its January 1992 reappointment of the Special Master, to reduce the length of the term of that reappointment, to reduce the level of compensation paid the Master and his staff, and to relieve the Commonwealth of the burden of paying for a year's worth of monitoring services in advance.  After considering and rejecting the motion, the district court decided that its signer had violated Rule 11.  The district court ordered a sanction of $500.  The sanctioned attorney, Kenneth Colon, now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Review of the Sanction Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rule 11 (in relevant part), an attorney's signature on a motion paper certifies that \"to the best of the signer's knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, [the motion] is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law ...\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.  The district court concluded that the signer of the motion paper before us failed in his duty to undertake reasonable inquiry.  In reviewing that holding, we must take account of that court's greater familiarity with relevant context, and \"apply an abuse-of-discretion standard.\"  Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 399, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2457, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990);  see also Muthig v. Brant Point Nantucket, Inc., 838 F.2d 600, 603 (1st Cir.1988).  Applying that standard, we have found no lawful basis for applying a sanction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reader can most easily understand why we reach this conclusion by examining attorney Colon's motion paper, attached to this opinion as an Appendix.  Just what is it about this paper, one might rightly ask, that would violate Rule 11?   The document makes three requests.  First, the motion asks the district court to reappoint the Special Master to a term shorter than an additional (nearly) full year.  It relies on the fact that our then-recent Navarro I opinion both 1) limited the Stipulation's scope to conditions at Rio Piedras Hospital, and 2) referred to Rio Piedras' conditions as close to compliance.  In light of those reasons, the motion asserts that the Master's duties under the Stipulation may be less extensive in the coming year than the district court had previously thought.  And, it claims that the parties' briefs discussing the implications of Navarro I (scheduled for submission in mid-March) would clarify the more limited scope of those future duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the motion asks the district court not to require the Commonwealth to \"prepay[ ]\" a year's worth of monitoring services, for such payment would be \"premature\" given that \"the need for and extent of these services has not been defined.\"   It adds that there \"is no reason why the required monitoring services cannot be compensated after their performance....\"  As authority, it cites Rule 53(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which gives federal courts broad authority to structure a special master's compensation.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(a) (compensation shall be paid \"as the court may direct\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the motion opposes the rates of compensation for the Special Master and staff set forth in the court-approved budget.  The motion, in an Appendix A, presents a chart which says, in effect, that the Commonwealth compensates its judges, inferior judicial officers, and comparable health care personnel at much lower rates of pay.  And the motion, in referring to Rule 53(a), makes clear that the district court has wide discretion to set the proper amount of compensation.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(a) (compensation \"shall be fixed by the court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based its Rule 11 finding primarily upon the motion's third request, seeking a reduction in compensation.  The January 1992 order reappointing the Special Master provided for compensation at the following hourly rates:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <pre>         Special Master                            $100.00\n         Special Master's assistant                  30.00\n         Psychiatrist                                75.00\n         Psychologist                                75.00\n         Social worker                               60.00\n         Occupational therapist                      25.00\n         Quality assurance director                  25.00</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's motion in opposition set forth (in its Appendix A) a different and much lower set of hourly rates at which, it said, the Commonwealth paid comparable employees:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <pre>         Superior Court judge                      $ 27.00\n         Superior Court law clerk                    10.00\n         Psychiatrist                                11.20\n         Psychologist                                11.20\n         Social worker                                9.80\n         Occupational therapist                       7.90\n         Quality assurance director                   7.90</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court took objection to this latter schedule.  The court said that this schedule did not reflect the pay that many health care professionals in the Commonwealth's employ actually receive.  The court said further that Colon had failed to make a reasonable prefiling inquiry into the actual pay of such professionals before suggesting Appendix A's pay scales, which were \"drastically below the staff's current rates.\"   These suggested pay scales, the court added, were \"insulting to the professionals on the Special Master's staff.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the record does not support the district court's conclusion that Rule 11 required attorney Colon to make a further inquiry.  For one thing, the object of Rule 11's inquiry requirement is to avoid filings that are baseless.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 (signature certifies that \"to the best of the signer's knowledge ... formed after reasonable inquiry, [the motion] is well grounded in fact and is warranted\" by law ) (emphasis added);  Cooter &amp; Gell, 496 U.S. at 393, 110 S.Ct. at 2454 (\"the central purpose of Rule 11 is to deter baseless filings\").  Here, the inquiry that the district court believed the appellant should have made would not have shown the motion to be baseless (i.e. legally unwarranted, or without adequate factual grounding).  It would simply have weakened, without destroying, the Commonwealth's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More specifically, the inquiry would have shown 1) that the motion's Appendix A accurately reflects an official Commonwealth pay scale, set by its central personnel agency, for permanent health care professionals, but 2) that the Commonwealth hires many (perhaps most) health care professionals, not as permanent employees, but under special contractual arrangements at higher rates.  In light of that showing, the Commonwealth might have found it more difficult, but not at all impossible, to proceed with its claim for lower compensation on the basis of Appendix A.  The legal standards governing special master compensation leave much to the district court's discretion.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(a).  And, an effort to tie the Special Master and staffs' compensation more directly to judicial compensation and to an \"official\" (though frequently skirted) Commonwealth pay scale is plausible, and within the realm of reasonable argument, even if that argument eventually would not carry the day.  Cf. Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 259 U.S. 101, 105, 42 S.Ct. 438, 439, 66 L.Ed. 844 (1922) (special master's compensation should be \"liberal, but not exorbitant\";  salaries \"for judicial officers performing similar duties are valuable guides,\" but a \"higher rate of compensation is generally necessary\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, the motion paper's failure to set forth a more complete account of Commonwealth pay practices did not impose significant additional costs upon the opposing party.  See, e.g., Unioil, Inc. v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., 809 F.2d 548, 557 (9th Cir.1986) (cost of foreseeable response by opposing parties relevant for determining what constitutes reasonable inquiry), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 822, 108 S.Ct. 83, 98 L.Ed.2d 45 (1987);  Jerold S. Solovy et al., Sanctions in Federal Litigation Sec. 2.04 at 2-18 (1991) (magnitude of burden in responding to filing affects thoroughness of investigation that must be performed).  That party, the Special Master, and the Master's staff, all had ready access to the relevant compensation-related facts and quickly brought them to the court's attention.  Of course, presenting these facts did cost the opposing party some time and effort.  But Rule 11 normally does not require one party to uncover and to set forth the facts that support the other side's position.  Cf. Continental Air Lines, Inc. v. Group Systems International Far East, Ltd., 109 F.R.D. 594, 598 (C.D.Cal.1986) (Rule 11 does not impose general duty to call all important facts to court's attention).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the motion, read fairly and as a whole, contains no significant false statement that significantly harmed the other side.  We emphasize the word \"significant\" because the district court found one sentence literally false.  That sentence says that the \"rates of pay\" for the Master's staff \"outpace by a factor of 6 or more to 1, the rates of pay of their counterparts in the Public Health System.\"   This statement is not literally false, if one uses the \"official\" pay scale for permanent employees as a comparison;  in light of actual pay practices, we would characterize it as \"overstatement\" or \"one-sided characterization.\"   But were it literally inaccurate, it would not matter, for Rule 11 neither penalizes overstatement nor authorizes an overly literal reading of each factual statement.

McLean Sav. and Loan Ass'n, 831 F.2d 1238, 1244-45 (4th Cir.1987) (Rule 11 \"does not extend to isolated factual errors, committed in good faith, so long as the pleading as a whole remains 'well grounded in fact.' \");   Gregory P. Joseph, Sanctions:  The Federal Law of Litigation Abuse Sec. 9(D) at 133-34 (1989) (\"The focus of ... Rule  is the court paper as a whole, not individual phrases or sentences construed separately or taken out of context....  [A]t some level of analysis, every unsuccessful litigation paper contains an unsupported allegation or flawed argument.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court provided several other justifications for its sanctions.  It said that Colon, in the motion paper, (1) should not have used the word \"bilking,\" (2) should not have called the payments \"burdensome\" without first investigating the actual \"effects of these payments on the Department of Health's budget,\" (3) should not have said the litigation was in the \"final stage of proceedings\" without asking government officials \"if full compliance and an end to this case were in fact close at hand,\" and (4) should not have asked to change the budgeting process without first finding out \"how the Special Master had been paid in the past.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, these circumstances do not justify a Rule 11 sanction, whether considered separately or all together.  (1) We concede that the word \"bilking\" is pejorative and, insofar as it implies cheating, without justification.  We also concede the obvious point that argument made to a judge is more appropriate (and usually works better) without pejoratives.  But to find support for a Rule 11 sanction in appellant's use of a single, rather mild (albeit unjustified) pejorative, is to impose a standard of perfection that few lawyers or judges would meet.  We are not aware of any reason or authority suggesting that Rule 11 imposes such a standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The motion paper does call the Special Master's budget \"burdensome,\" but we do not understand where, or how, Rule 11 forbids such a characterization.  No one disputes that the total amount of the Special Master's court-approved budget is $171,000.  Nothing in the record suggests that the Commonwealth found this amount insignificant;  nor do we understand either how further consultation with government officials would have led attorney Colon to change the characterization, or how the use of the word \"burdensome\" made a significant difference to the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Neither do we understand how, or why, Rule 11 would forbid attorney Colon to characterize the litigation as in the \"final stage of proceeding.\"   Our opinion in Navarro I curtailed the scope of the Stipulation and also observed that \"conditions\" at Rio Piedras may be \"largely ... in compliance.\"   The motion paper made clear that the Commonwealth would soon file a brief arguing in favor of significantly limiting the Special Master's monitoring activity.  Thus the statement seems to amount to an argument, reasonable in its context, that might, or might not, help convince a court.  The record does not make clear how further \"inquiry\" or further consultation with government officials would have shown the argument to have lacked adequate \"ground[ing] in fact.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) We agree with the district court that the motion paper, in requesting that \"monitoring services be compensated after their performance,\" does not take account of the fact that the current budgeting system provided for disbursement of budget funds (on a monthly basis) to the Special Master only after he performed services.  Nonetheless, we do not see how the motion's possible misstatement can justify a sanction.  Read fairly, and in context, the paper's request indicates that the Commonwealth objected to having to budget for a year's worth of monitoring services in advance, a portion of which might turn out to have been unnecessary.  At worst, the paper's statement reflects a minor, technical confusion about the budgeting process, and one which apparently caused no harm.  (After all, the opposing party, the Special Master, and the court, all understood, and could readily explain, how current budgeting worked.)   See Forrest Creek Associates, Ltd., 831 F.2d at 1244-45;  Joseph, Sanctions Sec. 9(D) at 133-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court, at most, could have found a few isolated instances of noncritical statements that further inquiry might have shown to be inaccurate or overstated.  That further inquiry would not have shown the motion's requests to have been baseless.  And, failure to make that inquiry did not unfairly impose upon the other party some special litigation cost or burden.  This case differs significantly from the kinds of cases in which this court has upheld a district court's imposition of Rule 11 sanctions.  Cf. Muthig, 838 F.2d at 605 (no reasonable inquiry where counsel could have readily learned from clients facts that would have shown their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress lacked validity);  Ryan v. Clemente, 901 F.2d 177, 179-81 (1st Cir.1990) (sanctioning harmful allegation that state officials failed to investigate illegal scheme where available record showed the contrary);  Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 632-34 (1st Cir.1990) (sanctioning attorney for unreasonably bringing and pursuing nine frivolous claims, including some with either no supporting evidence or where record directly contradicted claim);  Bay State Towing Co. v. Barge American 21, 899 F.2d 129, 131 (1st Cir.1990) (no reasonable inquiry where extensive record contains nothing to suggest why or how a person could have believed most of filing's claims).  We do not see how the district court could find a failure to undertake the \"reasonable inquiry\" that Rule 11 requires.

In View of the Circuit Court of Appeals Judgment Entered December 18, 1991 (No. 90-1339) The Prospective Appointment of the Master is Premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appeals Court decision of December 18, 1991 states that, \"Orders of the district court inconsistent with the opinion of this Court issued this date are vacated.\"   Said opinion has raised substantial questions regarding the breadth of the District Court's authority to implement institutional reform in Puerto Rico.  The parameters of the District Court's authority over places and persons related to this class action will require a careful reconsideration of all past and current District Court orders whether these be in the form of a Consent Decree, unilateral commitments, or Master's recommendations adopted by the court.  Until such an overview of the boundaries of this action is established, the long term re-appointment of the Master is premature.  Such an overview will only be possible after March 16, 1992 when the parties will submit, for the Court's consideration, their responses to the Court's inquiries and their briefs interpreting the appellate decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>II. The Request for Prospective Funding and The Proposed Budgetary Outlays Serve to Impose an Undue Financial Burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a more comprehensive brief addressing the current compliance requirements is scheduled for submission to the Court by March 16, 1992, the defendants now object vehemently to the prospective subsidy of monitoring activities represented by the Certification of January 30, 1992 and the Appendices thereto.  The extent of monitoring not yet determined, the prepayment of these services is premature and burdensome on the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Treasury.  There is no reason why the required monitoring services cannot be compensated after their performance especially when the need for and extent of these services has not been defined.  Rule 53(a) specifically allows for such a post-service compensation system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the budget outlays requested are completely incommensurate with the economies of public administration.  The objection to the budget requests are as follows:  1) The Special Master's compensation of $50,000 far exceeds a fair compensation for the services required at this final stage of the proceedings;  2) The Special Master's Assistant's compensation of $40,000 far exceeds a fair compensation for services at this final stage of the proceedings;  3) The rates of pay for the Advisory Interdisciplinary Team outpace, by a factor of 6 or more to 1, the rates of pay of their counterparts in the Public Health System of Puerto Rico;  and 4) the purchase of top of the line office equipment is inconsistent with the monitoring services to be performed and the budgetary limitations which must be considered.  These budgetary requests would occasion a bilking of the public treasury and are inconsistent with the opinion of the Court of Appeals.  What is a reasonable monitoring expenditure will be evident only following the submission of the parties' briefs by March 16, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WHEREFORE, the defendants respectfully ask for the above described relief from the Order of January 31, 1992 and pray that any future budgetary expenditures should reflect the current income levels of the health care professionals who dutifully serve the people of Puerto Rico (Please See Exhibit A), that the purchase of office equipment be limited to the minimum, necessary items at reasonable cost, that the Special Master and Assistant be permitted an hourly compensation commensurate with the hourly income of a Commonwealth District Court Judge and Law Clerk (Please See Exhibit A), and that the services of all persons engaged in monitoring be compensated post-performance instead of as an advance as permitted by Rule 53(a) and originally stated in the Order of February 8, 1985 in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I HEREBY CERTIFY that on this date, a true copy of the foregoing document has been sent by mail to:  DAVID M.

The district court based the sanction upon a motion that Colon signed, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which asked the court to reduce the compensation paid to a special master.  After reviewing the motion and the record, we find no violation of Rule 11.

In 1974, a group of patients at Rio Piedras Hospital filed suit, claiming that conditions there violated the federal Constitution.  In 1977, the district court entered a Stipulation, agreed upon by the parties, which prescribes reforms and sets standards for care and treatment.  In 1985, the district court appointed a Special Master who, assisted by a staff, was to monitor compliance with the Stipulation.  In 1987, the district court began to interpret the Stipulation as applying to other hospitals in Puerto Rico (at least insofar as they treated patients transferred from Rio Piedras).  The Special Master began to monitor treatment conditions and seek compliance with the Stipulation at, at least, one other hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1991, this court held that the Stipulation applied only to conditions at Rio Piedras;  in the court's view, the parties had not agreed to its application elsewhere.

After considering and rejecting the motion, the district court decided that its signer had violated Rule 11.  The district court ordered a sanction of $500.

The district court concluded that the signer of the motion paper before us failed in his duty to undertake reasonable inquiry.

Applying that standard, we have found no lawful basis for applying a sanction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reader can most easily understand why we reach this conclusion by examining attorney Colon's motion paper, attached to this opinion as an Appendix.  Just what is it about this paper, one might rightly ask, that would violate Rule 11?   The document makes three requests.  First, the motion asks the district court to reappoint the Special Master to a term shorter than an additional (nearly) full year.  It relies on the fact that our then-recent Navarro I opinion both 1) limited the Stipulation's scope to conditions at Rio Piedras Hospital, and 2) referred to Rio Piedras' conditions as close to compliance.  In light of those reasons, the motion asserts that the Master's duties under the Stipulation may be less extensive in the coming year than the district court had previously thought.  And, it claims that the parties' briefs discussing the implications of Navarro I (scheduled for submission in mid-March) would clarify the more limited scope of those future duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the motion asks the district court not to require the Commonwealth to \"prepay[ ]\" a year's worth of monitoring services, for such payment would be \"premature\" given that \"the need for and extent of these services has not been defined.\"   It adds that there \"is no reason why the required monitoring services cannot be compensated after their performance....\"  As authority, it cites Rule 53(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which gives federal courts broad authority to structure a special master's compensation.

The motion, in an Appendix A, presents a chart which says, in effect, that the Commonwealth compensates its judges, inferior judicial officers, and comparable health care personnel at much lower rates of pay.  And the motion, in referring to Rule 53(a), makes clear that the district court has wide discretion to set the proper amount of compensation.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(a) (compensation \"shall be fixed by the court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based its Rule 11 finding primarily upon the motion's third request, seeking a reduction in compensation.  The January 1992 order reappointing the Special Master provided for compensation at the following hourly rates:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <pre>         Special Master                            $100.00\n         Special Master's assistant                  30.00\n         Psychiatrist                                75.00\n         Psychologist                                75.00\n         Social worker                               60.00\n         Occupational therapist                      25.00\n         Quality assurance director                  25.00</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's motion in opposition set forth (in its Appendix A) a different and much lower set of hourly rates at which, it said, the Commonwealth paid comparable employees:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <pre>         Superior Court judge                      $ 27.00\n         Superior Court law clerk                    10.00\n         Psychiatrist                                11.20\n         Psychologist                                11.20\n         Social worker                                9.80\n         Occupational therapist                       7.90\n         Quality assurance director                   7.90</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court took objection to this latter schedule.  The court said that this schedule did not reflect the pay that many health care professionals in the Commonwealth's employ actually receive.  The court said further that Colon had failed to make a reasonable prefiling inquiry into the actual pay of such professionals before suggesting Appendix A's pay scales, which were \"drastically below the staff's current rates.\"   These suggested pay scales, the court added, were \"insulting to the professionals on the Special Master's staff.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the record does not support the district court's conclusion that Rule 11 required attorney Colon to make a further inquiry.  For one thing, the object of Rule 11's inquiry requirement is to avoid filings that are baseless.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 (signature certifies that \"to the best of the signer's knowledge ... formed after reasonable inquiry, [the motion] is well grounded in fact and is warranted\" by law ) (emphasis added);  Cooter &amp; <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112457\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gell,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. at 2454 (\"the central purpose of Rule 11 is to deter baseless filings\").  Here, the inquiry that the district court believed the appellant should have made would not have shown the motion to be baseless (i.e. legally unwarranted, or without adequate factual grounding).  It would simply have weakened, without destroying, the Commonwealth's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More specifically, the inquiry would have shown 1) that the motion's Appendix A accurately reflects an official Commonwealth pay scale, set by its central personnel agency, for permanent health care professionals, but 2) that the Commonwealth hires many (perhaps most) health care professionals, not as permanent employees, but under special contractual arrangements at higher rates.  In light of that showing, the Commonwealth might have found it more difficult, but not at all impossible, to proceed with its claim for lower compensation on the basis of Appendix A.  The legal standards governing special master compensation leave much to the district court's discretion.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(a).  And, an effort to tie the Special Master and staffs' compensation more directly to judicial compensation and to an \"official\" (though frequently skirted) Commonwealth pay scale is plausible, and within the realm of reasonable argument, even if that argument eventually would not carry the day.

Consolidated Gas Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99992\"><a href=\"/opinion/99992/newton-v-consolidated-gas-co-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 105, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99992\"><a href=\"/opinion/99992/newton-v-consolidated-gas-co-of-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See, e.g., Unioil, Inc. v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481708\"><a href=\"/opinion/481708/unioil-inc-and-heck-oil-inc-heck-heck-inc-and-mark-zelezny-v-ef/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 557 (9th Cir.1986) (cost of foreseeable response by opposing parties relevant for determining what constitutes reasonable inquiry), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Solovy et al., Sanctions in Federal Litigation Sec. 2.04 at 2-18 (1991) (magnitude of burden in responding to filing affects thoroughness of investigation that must be performed).  That party, the Special Master, and the Master's staff, all had ready access to the relevant compensation-related facts and quickly brought them to the court's attention.  Of course, presenting these facts did cost the opposing party some time and effort.  But Rule 11 normally does not require one party to uncover and to set forth the facts that support the other side's position.  Cf. Continental Air Lines, Inc. v. Group Systems International Far East, Ltd., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></span>, 598 (C.D.Cal.1986) (Rule 11 does not impose general duty to call all important facts to court's attention).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the motion, read fairly and as a whole, contains no significant false statement that significantly harmed the other side.  We emphasize the word \"significant\" because the district court found one sentence literally false.  That sentence says that the \"rates of pay\" for the Master's staff \"outpace by a factor of 6 or more to 1, the rates of pay of their counterparts in the Public Health System.\"   This statement is not literally false, if one uses the \"official\" pay scale for permanent employees as a comparison;  in light of actual pay practices, we would characterize it as \"overstatement\" or \"one-sided characterization.\"   But were it literally inaccurate, it would not matter, for Rule 11 neither penalizes overstatement nor authorizes an overly literal reading of each factual statement.  Forrest Creek Assoc., Ltd. v. McLean Sav. and Loan Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496596\"><a href=\"/opinion/496596/forrest-creek-associates-ltd-stephen-s-purdue-v-mclean-savings-and-loan/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span>, 1244-45 (4th Cir.1987) (Rule 11 \"does not extend to isolated factual errors, committed in good faith, so long as the pleading as a whole remains 'well grounded in fact.' \");   Gregory P. Joseph, Sanctions:  The Federal Law of Litigation Abuse Sec. 9(D) at 133-34 (1989) (\"The focus of ... Rule  is the court paper as a whole, not individual phrases or sentences construed separately or taken out of context....  [A]t some level of analysis, every unsuccessful litigation paper contains an unsupported allegation or flawed argument.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court provided several other justifications for its sanctions.  It said that Colon, in the motion paper, (1) should not have used the word \"bilking,\" (2) should not have called the payments \"burdensome\" without first investigating the actual \"effects of these payments on the Department of Health's budget,\" (3) should not have said the litigation was in the \"final stage of proceedings\" without asking government officials \"if full compliance and an end to this case were in fact close at hand,\" and (4) should not have asked to change the budgeting process without first finding out \"how the Special Master had been paid in the past.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, these circumstances do not justify a Rule 11 sanction, whether considered separately or all together.  (1) We concede that the word \"bilking\" is pejorative and, insofar as it implies cheating, without justification.  We also concede the obvious point that argument made to a judge is more appropriate (and usually works better) without pejoratives.  But to find support for a Rule 11 sanction in appellant's use of a single, rather mild (albeit unjustified) pejorative, is to impose a standard of perfection that few lawyers or judges would meet.  We are not aware of any reason or authority suggesting that Rule 11 imposes such a standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The motion paper does call the Special Master's budget \"burdensome,\" but we do not understand where, or how, Rule 11 forbids such a characterization.  No one disputes that the total amount of the Special Master's court-approved budget is $171,000.  Nothing in the record suggests that the Commonwealth found this amount insignificant;  nor do we understand either how further consultation with government officials would have led attorney Colon to change the characterization, or how the use of the word \"burdensome\" made a significant difference to the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Neither do we understand how, or why, Rule 11 would forbid attorney Colon to characterize the litigation as in the \"final stage of proceeding.\"   Our opinion in Navarro I curtailed the scope of the Stipulation and also observed that \"conditions\" at Rio Piedras may be \"largely ... in compliance.\"   The motion paper made clear that the Commonwealth would soon file a brief arguing in favor of significantly limiting the Special Master's monitoring activity.  Thus the statement seems to amount to an argument, reasonable in its context, that might, or might not, help convince a court.  The record does not make clear how further \"inquiry\" or further consultation with government officials would have shown the argument to have lacked adequate \"ground[ing] in fact.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) We agree with the district court that the motion paper, in requesting that \"monitoring services be compensated after their performance,\" does not take account of the fact that the current budgeting system provided for disbursement of budget funds (on a monthly basis) to the Special Master only after he performed services.  Nonetheless, we do not see how the motion's possible misstatement can justify a sanction.  Read fairly, and in context, the paper's request indicates that the Commonwealth objected to having to budget for a year's worth of monitoring services in advance, a portion of which might turn out to have been unnecessary.  At worst, the paper's statement reflects a minor, technical confusion about the budgeting process, and one which apparently caused no harm.  (After all, the opposing party, the Special Master, and the court, all understood, and could readily explain, how current budgeting worked.)   See Forrest Creek Associates, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496596\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ltd.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/496596/forrest-creek-associates-ltd-stephen-s-purdue-v-mclean-savings-and-loan/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1244-45</span></a></span>;  Joseph, Sanctions Sec. 9(D) at 133-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court, at most, could have found a few isolated instances of noncritical statements that further inquiry might have shown to be inaccurate or overstated.  That further inquiry would not have shown the motion's requests to have been baseless.  And, failure to make that inquiry did not unfairly impose upon the other party some special litigation cost or burden.  This case differs significantly from the kinds of cases in which this court has upheld a district court's imposition of Rule 11 sanctions.

The parameters of the District Court's authority over places and persons related to this class action will require a careful reconsideration of all past and current District Court orders whether these be in the form of a Consent Decree, unilateral commitments, or Master's recommendations adopted by the court.  Until such an overview of the boundaries of this action is established, the long term re-appointment of the Master is premature.  Such an overview will only be possible after March 16, 1992 when the parties will submit, for the Court's consideration, their responses to the Court's inquiries and their briefs interpreting the appellate decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>II.

The extent of monitoring not yet determined, the prepayment of these services is premature and burdensome on the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Treasury.  There is no reason why the required monitoring services cannot be compensated after their performance especially when the need for and extent of these services has not been defined.  Rule 53(a) specifically allows for such a post-service compensation system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the budget outlays requested are completely incommensurate with the economies of public administration.  The objection to the budget requests are as follows:  1) The Special Master's compensation of $50,000 far exceeds a fair compensation for the services required at this final stage of the proceedings;  2) The Special Master's Assistant's compensation of $40,000 far exceeds a fair compensation for services at this final stage of the proceedings;  3) The rates of pay for the Advisory Interdisciplinary Team outpace, by a factor of 6 or more to 1, the rates of pay of their counterparts in the Public Health System of Puerto Rico;  and 4) the purchase of top of the line office equipment is inconsistent with the monitoring services to be performed and the budgetary limitations which must be considered.  These budgetary requests would occasion a bilking of the public treasury and are inconsistent with the opinion of the Court of Appeals.  What is a reasonable monitoring expenditure will be evident only following the submission of the parties' briefs by March 16, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WHEREFORE, the defendants respectfully ask for the above described relief from the Order of January 31, 1992 and pray that any future budgetary expenditures should reflect the current income levels of the health care professionals who dutifully serve the people of Puerto Rico (Please See Exhibit A), that the purchase of office equipment be limited to the minimum, necessary items at reasonable cost, that the Special Master and Assistant be permitted an hourly compensation commensurate with the hourly income of a Commonwealth District Court Judge and Law Clerk (Please See Exhibit A), and that the services of all persons engaged in monitoring be compensated post-performance instead of as an advance as permitted by Rule 53(a) and originally stated in the Order of February 8, 1985 in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I HEREBY CERTIFY that on this date, a true copy of the foregoing document has been sent by mail to:  DAVID M.
