Appellant has appealed from  an order\n                    \n\nof  the district  court  holding him  in  civil contempt  for\n\nrefusing,  despite a  grant  of  immunity,  to testify  as  a\n\nwitness before  a grand jury.  See 28  U.S.C.   1826(a).  The\n                                  \n\ndistrict court, finding that the appeal was neither frivolous\n\nnor taken  for delay,  granted appellant's  request for  bail\n\npending appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1826(b).\n\n          Appellant's  position  is  that he  should  not  be\n\ncompelled  to  testify  because   the  government's  intended\n\nquestioning of  him would  constitute an abuse  of the  grand\n\njury  process.  The government seeks his testimony, according\n\nto  appellant, for  the primary purpose  of assisting  in the\n\nprosecution of a pending indictment.  \"It is well established\n\nthat a  grand jury may  not conduct an investigation  for the\n\nprimary   purpose   of   helping   the  prosecution   prepare\n\nindictments for trial.  The  prosecutor at a trial,  however,\n\nmay  use evidence  incidentally  gained  from  a  grand  jury\n\nprimarily  investigating other  crimes.\"   In  re Grand  Jury\n                                                             \n\nProceedings,  814 F.2d  61,  70  (1st  Cir.  1987)  (citation\n           \n\nomitted).   See In re Maury Santiago,  533 F.2d 727, 730 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1976);  United States v.

Calandra, 414\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 338 (1974),  has stated that a witness  is not \"entitled\n\n'to  challenge the  authority of  the court  or of  the grand\n\njury' or 'to  set limits to the investigation  that the grand\n\njury  may conduct.'\"   Id.  at 345  (quoting Blair  v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates,  250  U.S. 273,  282  (1919)).    On its  face,  this\n      \n\nstatement  could well  be  read  to signal  the  view of  the\n\nSupreme  Court that appellant's  challenge is precluded.   At\n\nleast  one court  has  so  interpreted  the  Supreme  Court's\n\nlanguage.  In re Grand  Jury Subpoenas of Clay, 603  F. Supp.\n                                              \n\n197,  200 (S.D.N.Y. 1985).  This approach would guard against\n\nunwarranted  interference  with  the  smooth  and   effective\n\nfunctioning of the grand jury process.\n\n          On  the  other hand,  this  court  in In  re  Maury\n                                                             \n\nSantiago, supra,  533 F.2d at  730, did  consider a  witness'\n               \n\nclaim  that the prosecutor was  improperly using a grand jury\n\nto prepare a  pending indictment for trial and  to harass the\n\n                             -3-\n\nwitness   for  his  political  beliefs.    We  noted  that  a\n\nrecalcitrant  witness   lacks  standing   to  challenge   the\n\ncomposition of  the grand jury  or to contend that  the grand\n\njury's  investigation  did  not  concern  matters  within the\n\nsubject  matter  jurisdiction  of the  federal  courts.   Id.\n                                                            \n\nNevertheless,  after holding that \"[t]he  courts . . . retain\n\ngeneral  supervisory power  over the  grand  jury to  prevent\n\nabuse of its  process . . .  ,\"  we entertained  and rejected\n\nthe witness' claims.  Id.\n                        \n\n          In  this  case,  for the  reasons  we  will discuss\n\nbelow, we would reject appellant's  arguments even if we were\n\nto rule that he had  standing to present them.  Consequently,\n\nwe need not rule on the question of standing.  See  Norton v.\n                                                          \n\nMathews, 427  U.S. 524, 530-32  (1976) (when relief is  to be\n       \n\ndenied  whether  or  not  the  court  has  jurisdiction,  the\n\njurisdictional question need not necessarily be decided).\n\n                       The Merits \n                                 \n\n          We turn, therefore, to the  merits.  In response to\n\nappellant's claim  of grand  jury abuse,  the district  court\n\nordered the government  to file a sealed,  ex parte affidavit\n                                                   \n\nexplaining why its questioning of appellant did not  have the\n\nprimary purpose of  assisting the prosecution of  the pending\n\nindictment.     The  court   reasoned  that  \"[i]n   view  of\n\n                             -4-\n\n[appellant's]  evident lack  of standing  and the  legitimate\n\nneed for grand jury investigations to proceed without lengthy\n\ninterruptions, no  more elaborate  procedure for  determining\n\nthe  grand jury's purpose is appropriate in the circumstances\n\nof this case.\"  \n\n          After reviewing  the ex  parte affidavit,\n                                        \n          signed  by one  of  the prosecutors,  the\n          court ruled that  \"for present purposes .\n          .  .  the  grand  jury  is  not   seeking\n          [appellant's]    testimony   solely    or\n          primarily to  obtain evidence to  be used\n          in prosecuting the  pending cases against\n          other  individuals.   Rather, it  appears\n          that   the   grand   jury   is   properly\n          investigating individuals who are not now\n          the subject of any indictment, as well as\n          possible   additional,  serious   charges\n          against some  current defendants.   There\n          does,   however,   appear  to   be   some\n          relationship between some  of the matters\n          being   investigated   and   the  pending\n          charges against some present defendants.\"\n\n          We  have   carefully  reviewed   the  prosecution's\n\naffidavit.   We agree  with the district  court that  it does\n\nindeed  demonstrate   that   the  primary   purpose  of   the\n\ngovernment's  questioning  of  appellant  is  to  investigate\n\ncrimes  other  than  those charged  in  the  indictment, both\n\nadditional charges against defendants named in the indictment\n\nand  charges that might be brought against other individuals.\n\n          It  is  true, as  the district  court acknowledged,\n\nthat there  is an overlap  between some of these  matters and\n\nthe  charges  contained  in  the  pending  indictment.    The\n\n                             -5-\n\nprosecution could obtain information  from its questioning of\n\nappellant that would  aid it in prosecuting  that indictment.\n\nAs long as this is not the primary purpose of the questioning\n\n-- and we  have held for present  purposes that it is  not --\n\nthere is  nothing  objectionable  about  this,  since  \"[t]he\n\nprosecutor at  a trial  . . .  may use  evidence incidentally\n\ngained  from  a  grand  jury  primarily  investigating  other\n\ncrimes.\"   In re Grand  Jury Proceedings, supra, 814  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n70.  Should  subsequent events demonstrate that,  despite our\n\ncurrent  ruling, the grand jury process has been abused here,\n\nthe defendants can move at trial to exclude any evidence that\n\nwas obtained  from appellant through abuse of  the grand jury\n\nprocess.   See In  re Grand Jury  Subpoena Duces  Tecum Dated\n                                                             \n\nJanuary 2,  1985 (Robert  M.

Although this procedure does\n\ndeprive appellant of  an opportunity to contest  the contents\n\nof the sealed  affidavit, the prosecution's need  for secrecy\n\nhere  is manifest.   A  requirement that  the  district court\n\nconduct a  \"minitrial\" in  such circumstances  would tend  to\n\n                             -6-\n\ndisrupt the  smooth and  effective functioning  of the  grand\n\njury process.  Especially given  the clear sufficiency of the\n\nprosecution's  affidavit,  no  such  extended  procedure  was\n\nnecessary here.  See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, supra, 814\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 72-73.\n\n          The order of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                     \n\n                             -7-\n",

See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1826(a).  The district court, finding that the appeal was neither frivolous nor taken for delay, granted appellant's request for bail pending appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1826(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's position is that he should not be compelled to testify because the government's intended questioning of him would constitute an abuse of the grand jury process.  The government seeks his testimony, according to appellant, for the primary purpose of assisting in the prosecution of a pending indictment.  \"It is well established that a grand jury may not conduct an investigation for the primary purpose of helping the prosecution prepare indictments for trial.  The prosecutor at a trial, however, may use evidence incidentally gained from a grand jury primarily investigating other crimes.\"   In re Grand Jury Proceedings, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484937\"><a href=\"/opinion/484937/in-re-grand-jury-proceedings-appeal-of-hilton-fernandez-diamante-in-re/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir. 1987) (citation omitted).

On its face, this statement could well be read to signal the view of the Supreme Court that appellant's challenge is precluded.  At least one court has so interpreted the Supreme Court's language.   In re Grand Jury Subpoenas of Clay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1888840\"><a href=\"/opinion/1888840/matter-of-grand-jury-subpoenas-of-clay/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 200 (S.D.N.Y. 1985).  This approach would guard against unwarranted interference with the smooth and effective functioning of the grand jury process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, this court in In re Maury <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334745\"><a href=\"/opinion/334745/in-re-edgar-maury-santiago/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Santiago,</span> supra</a></span>, 533 F.2d at 730, did consider a witness' claim that the prosecutor was improperly using a grand jury to prepare a pending indictment for trial and to harass the witness for his political beliefs.  We noted that a recalcitrant witness lacks standing to challenge the composition of the grand jury or to contend that the grand jury's investigation did not concern matters within the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334745\"><a href=\"/opinion/334745/in-re-edgar-maury-santiago/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Nevertheless, after </a></span>holding that \"[t]he courts ... retain general supervisory power over the grand jury to prevent abuse of its process ...,\" we entertained and rejected the witness' claims.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, for the reasons we will discuss below, we would reject appellant's arguments even if we were to rule that he had standing to present them.  Consequently, we need not rule on the question of standing.   See Norton v. Mathews, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109524\"><a href=\"/opinion/109524/norton-v-mathews/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 530-32 (1976) (when relief is to be denied whether or not the court has jurisdiction, the jurisdictional question need not necessarily be decided).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, therefore, to the merits.  In response to appellant's claim of grand jury abuse, the district court ordered the government to file a sealed, ex parte affidavit explaining why its questioning of appellant did not have the primary purpose of assisting the prosecution of the pending indictment.  The court reasoned that \"[i]n view of [appellant's] evident lack of standing and the legitimate need for grand jury investigations to proceed without lengthy interruptions, no more elaborate procedure for determining the grand jury's purpose is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>After reviewing the ex parte affidavit, signed by one of the prosecutors, the court ruled that \"for present purposes ... the grand jury is not seeking [appellant's] testimony solely or primarily to obtain evidence to be used in prosecuting the pending cases against other individuals.  Rather, it appears that the grand jury is properly investigating individuals who are not now the subject of any indictment, as well as possible additional, serious charges against some current defendants.  There does, however, appear to be some relationship between some of the matters being investigated and the pending charges against some present defendants.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully reviewed the prosecution's affidavit.  We agree with the district court that it does indeed demonstrate that the primary purpose of the government's questioning of appellant is to investigate crimes other than those charged in the indictment, both additional charges against defendants named in the indictment and charges that might be brought against other individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as the district court acknowledged, that there is an overlap between some of these matters and the charges contained in the pending indictment.  The prosecution could obtain information from its questioning of appellant that would aid it in prosecuting that indictment.  As long as this is not the primary purpose of the questioning-and we have held for present purposes that it is not-there is nothing objectionable about this, since \"[t]he prosecutor at a trial ... may use evidence incidentally gained from a grand jury primarily investigating other crimes.\"  In re Grand Jury <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484937\"><a href=\"/opinion/484937/in-re-grand-jury-proceedings-appeal-of-hilton-fernandez-diamante-in-re/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Proceedings,</span> supra</a></span>, 814 F.2d at 70.  Should subsequent events demonstrate that, despite our current ruling, the grand jury process has been abused here, the defendants can move at trial to exclude any evidence that was obtained from appellant through abuse of the grand jury process.   See In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated January 2, 1985 (Robert M. Simels, Esq.), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454794\"><a href=\"/opinion/454794/in-re-grand-jury-subpoena-duces-tecum-dated-january-2-1985-robert-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 30 (2nd Cir. 1985);   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"301729\"><a href=\"/opinion/301729/united-states-v-john-doe-in-the-matter-of-grand-jury-proceeding/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Doe,</span> supra</a></span>, 455 F.2d at 1276.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree with the district court that requiring a sealed, ex parte affidavit from the prosecution, and no more, was an adequate procedure, under the circumstances of this case, to probe whether or not the prosecution was attempting to abuse the grand jury process in its interrogation of appellant.  Although this procedure does deprive appellant of an opportunity to contest the contents of the sealed affidavit, the prosecution's need for secrecy here is manifest.  A requirement that the district court conduct a \"minitrial\" in such circumstances would tend to disrupt the smooth and effective functioning of the grand jury process.  Especially given the clear sufficiency of the prosecution's affidavit, no such extended procedure was necessary here.
