Shawmut  Bank, N.A.  asked the\n                           \n\nbankruptcy court to rule that the $109,000 debt owed to it by\n\nPaul  W.  Goodrich is  not  dischargeable  in his  Chapter  7\n\nbankruptcy because it was obtained through deliberately false\n\nstatements on  which the bank  relied.  The  bankruptcy court\n\nheld  that only $10,000 of the  debt was nondischargeable and\n\nthe district  court affirmed.   We  conclude that the  entire\n\ndebt is nondischargeable and remand.\n\n     On September 4, 1985,  Goodrich signed a promissory note\n\nand  credit agreement  with Shawmut  giving him  an unsecured\n\nrevolving  $100,000  line   of  credit.     This  arrangement\n\nreflected his  long-standing relationship  with the bank  and\n\nhis partnership in a Boston law firm.  Goodrich agreed to pay\n\nperiodic finance charges and to repay the outstanding balance\n\nand any accrued  interest on demand.  He was  not asked for a\n\npersonal financial statement at the time but agreed to submit\n\nsuch  statements on  request.   The  line  of credit  was  to\n\nexpire, and  any  outstanding  principal  and  interest  were\n\npayable, on the anniversary date.\n\n     On  February 22,  1986,  Shawmut increased  the line  of\n\ncredit to $150,000, and then on September 4, 1986, it renewed\n\nthe line of credit.  On  June 24, 1987, Goodrich gave Shawmut\n\na personal financial statement dated as of December 31, 1986,\n\nwhich  represented that the bank  could rely upon  it as true\n\nunless given written notice of a  change.  The line of credit\n\n                             -2-\n\nwas  renewed  again  on  September  4,  1987,  and  again  on\n\nSeptember  7, 1988.  Prior to the September 4, 1987, renewal,\n\nGoodrich  had drawn down and  owed $99,000 under  the line of\n\ncredit.    On  November  18,  1988,  Goodrich  drew  down  an\n\nadditional  $10,000,  making  his   total  debt  to   Shawmut\n\n$109,000, exclusive of interest.\n\n     Thereafter,  Goodrich filed for bankruptcy under Chapter\n\n7.  Shawmut, on  July 8, 1991, began an  adversary proceeding\n\nin this  bankruptcy objecting to any  discharge of Goodrich's\n\ndebt  to the bank.  It claimed that Goodrich in his financial\n\nstatement  submitted  in June  1987  had  failed  to list  $9\n\nmillion  in  contingent  liabilities and  made  certain other\n\nmaterial  misstatements or  omissions.    Shawmut invokes  11\n\nU.S.C.   523(a)(2)(B), which provides:\n\n             (a)  A  discharge  under section  727,\n          1141,  1228(a),  1228(b),  or 1328(b)  of\n          this   title   does   not  discharge   an\n          individual debtor from any debt - \n          . . . .\n             (2) for money, property,  services, or\n          an extension, renewal, or  refinancing of\n          credit, to the extent obtained by-\n          . . . .\n               (B) use of a statement in writing -\n                   (i)   that  is   materially\n               false;\n                   (ii) respecting  the debtor's or\n          an insider's financial condition;\n                   (iii) on which  the creditor  to\n          whom the debtor is liable for such money,\n          property, services,  or credit reasonably\n          relied; and\n                   (iv) that the  debtor caused  to\n          be  made  or  published  with  intent  to\n          deceive[.]\n\n                             -3-\n\n     The  bankruptcy court,  after  an  evidentiary  hearing,\n\nfound in  an oral  opinion that the  financial statement  did\n\ncontain material falsehoods  respecting Goodrich's  financial\n\ncondition made with intent to deceive; and as these  findings\n\nare uncontested on this  appeal, we need not elaborate.   The\n\nbankruptcy  judge also found that Shawmut  had proved that it\n\n\"would not have renewed  the loan had Mr. Goodrich  made full\n\nand complete  disclosure  of these  contingent  liabilities.\"\n\nBut, the  bankruptcy judge continued, this fact does not show\n\nthat such a refusal  to renew would have meant  that Goodrich\n\nwould  then  have  repaid  the  loan  (which  then  stood  at\n\n$99,000).  The oral opinion concluded:\n\n          And so, to that  extent, to the extent of\n          the balance which  was outstanding at the\n          time  that  they  [Shawmut] received  and\n          could  have  relied  upon this  financial\n          statement  there was  no  reliance.   The\n          money was  already out the door and would\n          not   come  home  just  because  a  false\n          financial statement was given.\n\n     The bankruptcy judge then ruled that the bank had proved\n\nreliance  upon the  false financial  statement to  the extent\n\nthat it  had advanced  $10,000 after the  financial statement\n\nwas provided  to  it  and that  this  amount,  together  with\n\npertinent costs, was the amount that would  not be discharged\n\nby bankruptcy.  On  appeal, the district court affirmed  in a\n\nmemorandum, echoing the reasoning of the bankruptcy judge and\n\nrelying specifically  upon Danns v. Household  Finance Corp.,\n                                                           \n\n558 F.2d 114 (2d Cir. 1977), which we discuss below.\n\n                             -4-\n\n     Although  we disagree  with the  outcome reached  by the\n\nbankruptcy judge and the  district court, it is only  fair to\n\nsay  that this  provision of  the Bankruptcy  Code, governing\n\nnondischargeability  for false statements, has spawned a fair\n\namount of  case law, inter-circuit conflicts and considerable\n\nconfusion.   The seeming  simplicity of  section 523(a)(2)(B)\n\nconceals  not only a couple of linguistic traps but a lineage\n\nof opaque legislative history.  Still, the simple language of\n\nsection 523(a)(2)(B) is the  starting point for analysis and,\n\nin the end, the basis for our decision.\n\n     Reading the statute  literally, Shawmut appears  to meet\n\neach  of its  requirements needed  to make  the $99,000  loan\n\nnondischargeable.  The $99,000 loan was a \"debt\" reflecting a\n\n\"renewal . . . of credit\"; the renewal was \"obtained by . . .\n\nuse  of  a  statement  in  writing\";  and  the   writing  was\n\n\"materially  false,\" it was  related to  Goodrich's financial\n\ncondition, Shawmut \"reasonably relied\" on it, and it was made\n\nwith intent  to deceive.  Although the statute bars discharge\n\nonly \"to the  extent\" that  the renewal was  obtained by  the\n\nfalse  statement,  we  think  this   causation  element--also\n\nreflected in the  statute's \"reliance\" requirement--is easily\n\nsatisfied here as to the full $99,000.\n\n     The bank offered evidence from  a bank official that the\n\n$99,000 loan would \"probably\" not have been renewed in either\n\n1987 or 1988  if the true  financial liabilities of  Goodrich\n\n                             -5-\n\nhad been set forth  in the financial statement  he submitted;\n\nthat  the bank  relied upon  the  financial statement  in its\n\nrenewal  of  the loan;  and  that  the omission  of  material\n\ninformation   was  a  \"substantial  factor\"  in  causing  the\n\nrenewal.   This evidence,  presumably, led to  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's  finding  that  \"the   bank  has  demonstrated  by  a\n\npreponderance of the  evidence that they [sic] would not have\n\nrenewed the  loan  had Mr.  Goodrich made  full and  complete\n\ndisclosure . . . .\"\n\n     The evidence  amply supports the  finding.   Likelihoods\n\nare about all that can be expected where the question is what\n\nthe  bank would  have  done five  years ago  if faced  with a\n\ndisclosure that did  not occur.   Indeed, there  is case  law\n\nthat  supports the view that it is enough if the misstatement\n\nor omission is a \"substantial factor\" in the decision to make\n\nor renew  a loan.  In  re Gerlach, 897 F.2d  1048, 1052 (10th\n                                 \n\nCir.  1990) (collecting cases).   After  all, if  a financial\n\nstatement is materially false and intended to deceive, then a\n\nshowing that the creditor  \"relied\" upon it arguably requires\n\nno more than that the creditor took it  into account and gave\n\nit  weight.   Here, the  bankruptcy court's  explicit finding\n\nalready quoted makes fine distinctions unnecessary.\n\n     Although  each of the  statutory requirements of section\n\n523(a)(2)(B)  is thus  satisfied, Goodrich  remarkably enough\n\ndoes have  two decent arguments in  his favor.  The  first is\n\n                             -6-\n\nthat  some  courts have  read  into the  statute  yet another\n\nrequirement, not reflected in its explicit language, that the\n\ncreditor show  that it  was damaged  by the  false statement.\n                                   \n\nSee  Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice,   27.41, at pt. 27,\n                                        \n\np.  76 &amp; n.22 (1991)  (collecting cases); cf.  In re Siriani,\n                                                            \n\n967 F.2d  302 (9th  Cir. 1992) (limited  damage requirement).\n\nDamage  is  easily shown  where  the bank  lends  money after\n                                                             \n\nreceiving a false statement  and in reliance upon it.  But in\n\nthe  case of a  renewal of an  earlier untainted  loan, it is\n\npossible that the bank would have called the loan if accurate\n\ninformation had been furnished on renewal and yet been unable\n\nto collect a penny before bankruptcy.\n\n     This possibility appears to be what the bankruptcy judge\n\nhad in mind when he said of the $99,000 that \"[t]he money was\n\nalready out  the door and would not  come home just because a\n\nfalse   financial  statement  was   given.\"     Although  the\n\nbankruptcy judge  used the phrase  \"no reliance\"  immediately\n\nbefore making  this statement, a later  passage suggests that\n\nhe meant that  the bank  had not--so far  as the $99,000  was\n\nconcerned--\"relied to  its detriment.\"   In other  words, the\n\nbank  relied on the false statement in renewing the loan (the\n\njudge had  already so  found), but--in the  judge's view--the\n\nbank  had not  shown that  the reliance  caused the  ultimate\n\nloss.\n\n                             -7-\n\n     The bank on appeal  zealously contests this \"finding\" of\n\nno detriment.  It asserts that Goodrich's financial statement\n\non renewal showed  that he  had over $800,000  in cash,  bank\n\ndeposits   and  marketable  securities.    It  follows,  says\n\nShawmut,  that the  bank could  have collected  the money  by\n\ncalling  the loan  or  by insisting  that securities  or real\n\nproperty interests of Goodrich be pledged to secure the loan.\n\nIn any event, Shawmut argues, there is no requirement that it\n\nshow  detriment in  the  sense of  ultimate loss;  reasonable\n\nreliance  on  the false  statement  in renewing  the  loan is\n\nenough.\n\n     We agree with Shawmut that  the only detriment that need\n\nbe shown is the  renewal of the loan.   To be sure, it  would\n\nnot be absurd  to require,  in addition, that  the bank  show\n\nthat  it could--or  even  would--have collected  on the  loan\n\nprior  to bankruptcy but for  the renewal.   Some courts have\n\ndone so.   The nondischargeability  provisions are frequently\n\nconstrued in favor  of debtors.   3 Collier  on Bankruptcy   \n                                                          \n\n523.05A  (15th ed.  1993) (collecting  cases).   Further, one\n\ncould argue that if the bank was not ultimately harmed by the\n\nrenewal,  it should not be  able to improve  its situation in\n\nthe bankruptcy proceeding based  on the happenstance that the\n\nrenewal was based on a false statement.\n\n     The   difficulty   is   that  including   this   further\n\nrequirement of actual damage is a policy choice.  There is no\n\n                             -8-\n\nindication in the statutory  language that Congress made such\n\na  choice,  and  the  evidence from  legislative  history  is\n\ninconclusive.     The  statute  is  quite   detailed  in  its\n\nconditions for nondischargeability.   Had Congress  wished to\n\nadd \"damage\" as  an element,  it could easily  have done  so,\n\nespecially  since   some  of  the  decisions   favoring  this\n\nrequirement   were  issued   before   the   elaboration   and\n\nreenactment of section 523(a)(2)(B) in 1978.  Congress, as we\n\nshall see, actually had some knowledge of case law construing\n\nthe predecessor section when it adopted its new version.\n\n     If  it  considered the  matter  at  all, Congress  could\n\neasily  have  concluded  on  policy  grounds  that  a  damage\n\nrequirement was not appropriate.   The debtor, by hypothesis,\n\nhas caused the trouble by making a materially false statement\n\nwith intent to deceive and the creditor has reasonably relied\n\nupon the statement in renewing the loan.  Congress could have\n\nthought that making the bank  shoulder the further burden  of\n\nproving  that  it  could have  collected  the  loan  prior to\n\nbankruptcy--a matter of solvency on which the debtor has most\n\nof  the  information--was  not   a  proper  addition  to  the\n\ncompromises reflected in section 523(a)(2)(B).  \n\n     The  legislative  history  of  section  523(a)(2)(B)  is\n\ninvoked at  some length by  both sides, and  it does  in fact\n\ndiscuss the  case in which  a loan is  renewed.  We  find the\n\ndiscussion tangled,  if not  contradictory, but note  that it\n\n                             -9-\n\nlends some support to Shawmut by stressing that \"[t]he amount\n\nof the  debt  made nondischargeable  on  account of  a  false\n\nfinancial statement  is not  limited to `new  value' extended\n\nwhen a loan is  rolled over.\"   H. Rep. No.  595, 95th Cong.,\n\n1st  Sess. 129-30 (1977).   The problem is  that the question\n\nhere is when, and on what conditions, is the \"old money\" made\n\nnondischargeable,  and on  that  issue  the same  legislative\n\nhistory may be more confusing than helpful.  Id.1\n                                               \n\n     In  all events,  even if  Congress never  considered the\n\npoint  one way  or  the  other,  the  outcome  is  the  same.\n\nCongress enacted  a  detailed  statute  without  an  explicit\n\ndamage requirement.  In the  face of conflicting policies for\n\nand against, there is no warrant for the court to  add such a\n\nrequirement.  Accordingly, there is no need here to weigh the\n\nbank's evidence or disturb the  bankruptcy judge's conclusion\n\nthat there was no detriment, in  the sense he used the  term,\n\nso far as  the $99,000 is  concerned.   Instead we hold  that\n\ndetriment  or damage  in  that  sense  is  not  required  for\n\nnondischargeability.   Accord  In re  Gerlach, 897  F.2d 1048\n                                             \n\n(10th Cir. 1990).  To the extent that the Ninth Circuit is in\n\n                    \n\n     1Just as  the  House Report  is  on balance  helpful  to\nShawmut, so  there are  floor statements (quoted  below) that\nare marginally helpful to Goodrich.  This floor language does\nuse the phrase  \"relied to his detriment,\"  as the bankruptcy\njudge  did in this case; but the  phrase was used only in the\ncontext of discussing the special problem of In re Danns, and\n                                                        \nwe  decline to  read it  as a general  gloss on  the statute,\nwhich contains no such words.\n\n                             -10-\n\ndisagreement,  see In re Siriani,  we prefer to  follow In re\n                                                             \n\nGerlach for the reasons already set forth.\n       \n\n     Yet there  is more to be  said.  The district  court, in\n\naffirming  the  bankruptcy  court,  used  some  of  the  same\n\nreasoning but  also invoked a different  argument, renewed by\n\nGoodrich in  this court, by  relying upon Danns  v. Household\n                                                             \n\nFinance  Corp., 558  F.2d 114  (2d  Cir. 1977).

There the\n\ndebtor secured a  new loan  from a finance  company based  on\n\nfalse  statements; and  the question  was whether  this false\n\nstatement also rendered nondischargeable an earlier untainted\n\nloan that  the finance company consolidated with  the new one\n\nsimply because state  law forbad the company  from having two\n\nloans to the same debtor.\n\n     The Second Circuit  ruled in a  very brief opinion  that\n\n\"there  was no evidence that the original loan was renewed in\n\nreliance on  the false  representations,\" but instead  it was\n\nrenewed  and consolidated because of the state law.  558 F.2d\n\nat 116.   Thus, said the  court, the renewal was  not \"a true\n\nextension of the original loan; the record does not show that\n\n[the original loan] . . . would have fallen due sooner had it\n\nnot been for the refinancing.\"  Id.  The court concluded that\n                                   \n\n\"the   only   credit   extended   in   reliance   on   Danns'\n\n                             -11-\n\nmisrepresentation was the additional amount loaned,\" and only\n\nthis new cash was nondischargeable.  Id.\n                                        \n\n     We have  devoted this space to  describing Danns because\n                                                     \n\nCongress, in adopting  section 523(a)(2)(B) in  the following\n\nyear, may  be taken to have  endorsed it by name.   After the\n\nbill  emerged  from   a  House-Senate  Conference  Committee,\n\nSection   523(a)(2)(B) was  explained to  both the House  and\n\nSenate in the following terms:\n\n             In many cases,  a creditor is required\n          by state law to refinance existing credit\n          on which  there has been no  default.  If\n          the creditor does not forfeit remedies or\n          otherwise  rely  to  his  detriment  on a\n          false financial statement with respect to\n          existing   credit,   then  an   extension\n          renewal, or refinancing of such credit is\n          nondischargeable  only  to the  extent of\n          the  new  money  advanced; on  the  other\n          hand, if  an existing loan is  in default\n          or  the   creditor  otherwise  reasonably\n          relies  to  his   detriment  on  a  false\n          financial  statement  with  regard to  an\n          existing  loan, then  the entire  debt is\n          nondischargeable       under      section\n          523(a)(2)(B).       This   codifies   the\n          reasoning expressed by the second circuit\n          in In  re Danns, 558 F.2d  114 (2d [C]ir.\n                         \n          1977).\n\n124 Cong. Rec. 24, 32399 (1978) (statement of  Rep. Edwards),\n\n124  Cong.   Rec.  25,   33998  (1978)  (statement   of  Sen.\n\nDeConcini).    We  do  not find  this  general  language very\n\nhelpful in resolving the present case--there was no state law\n\nhere requiring  refinancing and,  while the $99,000  loan was\n\nnot \"in default,\" Goodrich's debt to Shawmut was repayable on\n\ndemand.  Further, we  regard the floor discussion more  as an\n\n                             -12-\n\nattempt  to explain and approve Danns than as a general gloss\n                                     \n\non the statute.\n\n     Nevertheless,  the  floor  statements  are  pretty  good\n\nevidence  that  Congress  approved  of  Danns  and,  on  that\n                                             \n\nassumption, it is appropriate to measure our case against the\n\nrationale of Danns.  The Second Circuit's holding  was framed\n                  \n\nas an  interpretation of  the \"reliance\" requirement  that is\n\nexplicit in the  statute.   The court said  that the  finance\n\ncompany did not \"rely\"  on the false statement in  continuing\n\nthe original loan because the old loan was not up for renewal\n\nat  the  time  of  the  new   loan,  and  the  old  loan  was\n\nconsolidated and  renewed solely  because of New  York's \"one\n\nloan\" law.  Danns may have depended also on the court's sense\n                 \n\nof  fairness.   After all,  whatever the  causal relationship\n\nbetween  the false statement and the renewal of the old loan,\n\nit  was sheer accident--a twist of New York law--that the old\n\nuntainted loan was renewed rather than left alone.\n\n     By  contrast, Goodrich's loan expired in September 1987,\n\nand then again in September 1988, unless renewed.  It was the\n\nbank that  called for  the financial statement  prior to  the\n\nSeptember 1987 renewal, presumably because it had an interest\n\nin managing the line of credit and the $99,000 loan.   So far\n\nas  appears,  the later  draw  down  of $10,000  more,  which\n\noccurred  in  late  1988, was  not  an  issue  when the  bank\n\naccepted the  false financial statement and  considered it in\n\n                             -13-\n\nrenewing  the loan in 1987.   Here, the  evidence showed that\n\nthe bank did \"rely\" on the false statement in renewing a loan\n\nthat would otherwise have fallen  due.  Accordingly, we think\n\nthat Danns is distinguishable in both letter and spirit.  \n          \n\n     We therefore  vacate the judgment of  the district court\n                         \n\nand remand to the bankruptcy court with directions to include\n          \n\nthe $99,000  original  loan  in the  amount  of  debt  deemed\n\nnondischargeable, together with the later  $10,000 loan whose\n\nstatus  is undisputed.  The  question of what  costs and fees\n\nare  appropriately due to Shawmut is not before us, and we do\n\nnot address it.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n                      \n\n                             -14-\n",

Shawmut  Bank, N.A.  asked the\n                           \n\nbankruptcy court to rule that the $109,000 debt owed to it by\n\nPaul  W.  Goodrich is  not  dischargeable  in his  Chapter  7\n\nbankruptcy because it was obtained through deliberately false\n\nstatements on  which the bank  relied.  The  bankruptcy court\n\nheld  that only $10,000 of the  debt was nondischargeable and\n\nthe district  court affirmed.   We  conclude that the  entire\n\ndebt is nondischargeable and remand.\n\n     On September 4, 1985,  Goodrich signed a promissory note\n\nand  credit agreement  with Shawmut  giving him  an unsecured\n\nrevolving  $100,000  line   of  credit.     This  arrangement\n\nreflected his  long-standing relationship  with the bank  and\n\nhis partnership in a Boston law firm.  Goodrich agreed to pay\n\nperiodic finance charges and to repay the outstanding balance\n\nand any accrued  interest on demand.  He was  not asked for a\n\npersonal financial statement at the time but agreed to submit\n\nsuch  statements on  request.   The  line  of credit  was  to\n\nexpire, and  any  outstanding  principal  and  interest  were\n\npayable, on the anniversary date.\n\n     On  February 22,  1986,  Shawmut increased  the line  of\n\ncredit to $150,000, and then on September 4, 1986, it renewed\n\nthe line of credit.  On  June 24, 1987, Goodrich gave Shawmut\n\na personal financial statement dated as of December 31, 1986,\n\nwhich  represented that the bank  could rely upon  it as true\n\nunless given written notice of a  change.  The line of credit\n\n                             -2-\n\nwas  renewed  again  on  September  4,  1987,  and  again  on\n\nSeptember  7, 1988.  Prior to the September 4, 1987, renewal,\n\nGoodrich  had drawn down and  owed $99,000 under  the line of\n\ncredit.    On  November  18,  1988,  Goodrich  drew  down  an\n\nadditional  $10,000,  making  his   total  debt  to   Shawmut\n\n$109,000, exclusive of interest.\n\n     Thereafter,  Goodrich filed for bankruptcy under Chapter\n\n7.  Shawmut, on  July 8, 1991, began an  adversary proceeding\n\nin this  bankruptcy objecting to any  discharge of Goodrich's\n\ndebt  to the bank.  It claimed that Goodrich in his financial\n\nstatement  submitted  in June  1987  had  failed  to list  $9\n\nmillion  in  contingent  liabilities and  made  certain other\n\nmaterial  misstatements or  omissions.    Shawmut invokes  11\n\nU.S.C.   523(a)(2)(B), which provides:\n\n             (a)  A  discharge  under section  727,\n          1141,  1228(a),  1228(b),  or 1328(b)  of\n          this   title   does   not  discharge   an\n          individual debtor from any debt - \n          . . . .\n             (2) for money, property,  services, or\n          an extension, renewal, or  refinancing of\n          credit, to the extent obtained by-\n          . . . .\n               (B) use of a statement in writing -\n                   (i)   that  is   materially\n               false;\n                   (ii) respecting  the debtor's or\n          an insider's financial condition;\n                   (iii) on which  the creditor  to\n          whom the debtor is liable for such money,\n          property, services,  or credit reasonably\n          relied; and\n                   (iv) that the  debtor caused  to\n          be  made  or  published  with  intent  to\n          deceive[.]\n\n                             -3-\n\n     The  bankruptcy court,  after  an  evidentiary  hearing,\n\nfound in  an oral  opinion that the  financial statement  did\n\ncontain material falsehoods  respecting Goodrich's  financial\n\ncondition made with intent to deceive; and as these  findings\n\nare uncontested on this  appeal, we need not elaborate.   The\n\nbankruptcy  judge also found that Shawmut  had proved that it\n\n\"would not have renewed  the loan had Mr. Goodrich  made full\n\nand complete  disclosure  of these  contingent  liabilities.\"\n\nBut, the  bankruptcy judge continued, this fact does not show\n\nthat such a refusal  to renew would have meant  that Goodrich\n\nwould  then  have  repaid  the  loan  (which  then  stood  at\n\n$99,000).  The oral opinion concluded:\n\n          And so, to that  extent, to the extent of\n          the balance which  was outstanding at the\n          time  that  they  [Shawmut] received  and\n          could  have  relied  upon this  financial\n          statement  there was  no  reliance.   The\n          money was  already out the door and would\n          not   come  home  just  because  a  false\n          financial statement was given.\n\n     The bankruptcy judge then ruled that the bank had proved\n\nreliance  upon the  false financial  statement to  the extent\n\nthat it  had advanced  $10,000 after the  financial statement\n\nwas provided  to  it  and that  this  amount,  together  with\n\npertinent costs, was the amount that would  not be discharged\n\nby bankruptcy.  On  appeal, the district court affirmed  in a\n\nmemorandum, echoing the reasoning of the bankruptcy judge and\n\nrelying specifically  upon Danns v. Household  Finance Corp.,\n                                                           \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"346954\"><a href=\"/opinion/346954/in-re-keith-orin-danns-aka-keith-o-danns-aka-keith-danns-bankrupt/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(2d Cir. 1977), which we discuss below.\n\n                             -4-\n\n     Although  we disagree  with the  outcome reached  by the\n\nbankruptcy judge and the  district court, it is only  fair to\n\nsay  that this  provision of  the Bankruptcy  Code, governing\n\nnondischargeability  for false statements, has spawned a fair\n\namount of  case law, inter-circuit conflicts and considerable\n\nconfusion.   The seeming  simplicity of  section 523(a)(2)(B)\n\nconceals  not only a couple of linguistic traps but a lineage\n\nof opaque legislative history.  Still, the simple language of\n\nsection 523(a)(2)(B) is the  starting point for analysis and,\n\nin the end, the basis for our decision.\n\n     Reading the statute  literally, Shawmut appears  to meet\n\neach  of its  requirements needed  to make  the $99,000  loan\n\nnondischargeable.  The $99,000 loan was a \"debt\" reflecting a\n\n\"renewal . . . of credit\"; the renewal was \"obtained by . . .\n\nuse  of  a  statement  in  writing\";  and  the   writing  was\n\n\"materially  false,\" it was  related to  Goodrich's financial\n\ncondition, Shawmut \"reasonably relied\" on it, and it was made\n\nwith intent  to deceive.  Although the statute bars discharge\n\nonly \"to the  extent\" that  the renewal was  obtained by  the\n\nfalse  statement,  we  think  this   causation  element--also\n\nreflected in the  statute's \"reliance\" requirement--is easily\n\nsatisfied here as to the full $99,000.\n\n     The bank offered evidence from  a bank official that the\n\n$99,000 loan would \"probably\" not have been renewed in either\n\n1987 or 1988  if the true  financial liabilities of  Goodrich\n\n                             -5-\n\nhad been set forth  in the financial statement  he submitted;\n\nthat  the bank  relied upon  the  financial statement  in its\n\nrenewal  of  the loan;  and  that  the omission  of  material\n\ninformation   was  a  \"substantial  factor\"  in  causing  the\n\nrenewal.   This evidence,  presumably, led to  the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's  finding  that  \"the   bank  has  demonstrated  by  a\n\npreponderance of the  evidence that they [sic] would not have\n\nrenewed the  loan  had Mr.  Goodrich made  full and  complete\n\ndisclosure . . . .\"\n\n     The evidence  amply supports the  finding.   Likelihoods\n\nare about all that can be expected where the question is what\n\nthe  bank would  have  done five  years ago  if faced  with a\n\ndisclosure that did  not occur.   Indeed, there  is case  law\n\nthat  supports the view that it is enough if the misstatement\n\nor omission is a \"substantial factor\" in the decision to make\n\nor renew  a loan.

After  all, if  a financial\n\nstatement is materially false and intended to deceive, then a\n\nshowing that the creditor  \"relied\" upon it arguably requires\n\nno more than that the creditor took it  into account and gave\n\nit  weight.   Here, the  bankruptcy court's  explicit finding\n\nalready quoted makes fine distinctions unnecessary.\n\n     Although  each of the  statutory requirements of section\n\n523(a)(2)(B)  is thus  satisfied, Goodrich  remarkably enough\n\ndoes have  two decent arguments in  his favor.  The  first is\n\n                             -6-\n\nthat  some  courts have  read  into the  statute  yet another\n\nrequirement, not reflected in its explicit language, that the\n\ncreditor show  that it  was damaged  by the  false statement.\n                                   \n\nSee  Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice,   27.41, at pt. 27,\n                                        \n\np.  76 &amp; n.22 (1991)  (collecting cases); cf.

But in\n\nthe  case of a  renewal of an  earlier untainted  loan, it is\n\npossible that the bank would have called the loan if accurate\n\ninformation had been furnished on renewal and yet been unable\n\nto collect a penny before bankruptcy.\n\n     This possibility appears to be what the bankruptcy judge\n\nhad in mind when he said of the $99,000 that \"[t]he money was\n\nalready out  the door and would not  come home just because a\n\nfalse   financial  statement  was   given.\"     Although  the\n\nbankruptcy judge  used the phrase  \"no reliance\"  immediately\n\nbefore making  this statement, a later  passage suggests that\n\nhe meant that  the bank  had not--so far  as the $99,000  was\n\nconcerned--\"relied to  its detriment.\"   In other  words, the\n\nbank  relied on the false statement in renewing the loan (the\n\njudge had  already so  found), but--in the  judge's view--the\n\nbank  had not  shown that  the reliance  caused the  ultimate\n\nloss.\n\n                             -7-\n\n     The bank on appeal  zealously contests this \"finding\" of\n\nno detriment.  It asserts that Goodrich's financial statement\n\non renewal showed  that he  had over $800,000  in cash,  bank\n\ndeposits   and  marketable  securities.    It  follows,  says\n\nShawmut,  that the  bank could  have collected  the money  by\n\ncalling  the loan  or  by insisting  that securities  or real\n\nproperty interests of Goodrich be pledged to secure the loan.\n\nIn any event, Shawmut argues, there is no requirement that it\n\nshow  detriment in  the  sense of  ultimate loss;  reasonable\n\nreliance  on  the false  statement  in renewing  the  loan is\n\nenough.\n\n     We agree with Shawmut that  the only detriment that need\n\nbe shown is the  renewal of the loan.   To be sure, it  would\n\nnot be absurd  to require,  in addition, that  the bank  show\n\nthat  it could--or  even  would--have collected  on the  loan\n\nprior  to bankruptcy but for  the renewal.   Some courts have\n\ndone so.   The nondischargeability  provisions are frequently\n\nconstrued in favor  of debtors.   3 Collier  on Bankruptcy   \n                                                          \n\n523.05A  (15th ed.  1993) (collecting  cases).   Further, one\n\ncould argue that if the bank was not ultimately harmed by the\n\nrenewal,  it should not be  able to improve  its situation in\n\nthe bankruptcy proceeding based  on the happenstance that the\n\nrenewal was based on a false statement.\n\n     The   difficulty   is   that  including   this   further\n\nrequirement of actual damage is a policy choice.  There is no\n\n                             -8-\n\nindication in the statutory  language that Congress made such\n\na  choice,  and  the  evidence from  legislative  history  is\n\ninconclusive.     The  statute  is  quite   detailed  in  its\n\nconditions for nondischargeability.   Had Congress  wished to\n\nadd \"damage\" as  an element,  it could easily  have done  so,\n\nespecially  since   some  of  the  decisions   favoring  this\n\nrequirement   were  issued   before   the   elaboration   and\n\nreenactment of section 523(a)(2)(B) in 1978.  Congress, as we\n\nshall see, actually had some knowledge of case law construing\n\nthe predecessor section when it adopted its new version.\n\n     If  it  considered the  matter  at  all, Congress  could\n\neasily  have  concluded  on  policy  grounds  that  a  damage\n\nrequirement was not appropriate.   The debtor, by hypothesis,\n\nhas caused the trouble by making a materially false statement\n\nwith intent to deceive and the creditor has reasonably relied\n\nupon the statement in renewing the loan.  Congress could have\n\nthought that making the bank  shoulder the further burden  of\n\nproving  that  it  could have  collected  the  loan  prior to\n\nbankruptcy--a matter of solvency on which the debtor has most\n\nof  the  information--was  not   a  proper  addition  to  the\n\ncompromises reflected in section 523(a)(2)(B).  \n\n     The  legislative  history  of  section  523(a)(2)(B)  is\n\ninvoked at  some length by  both sides, and  it does  in fact\n\ndiscuss the  case in which  a loan is  renewed.  We  find the\n\ndiscussion tangled,  if not  contradictory, but note  that it\n\n                             -9-\n\nlends some support to Shawmut by stressing that \"[t]he amount\n\nof the  debt  made nondischargeable  on  account of  a  false\n\nfinancial statement  is not  limited to `new  value' extended\n\nwhen a loan is  rolled over.\"   H. Rep. No.  595, 95th Cong.,\n\n1st  Sess. 129-30 (1977).   The problem is  that the question\n\nhere is when, and on what conditions, is the \"old money\" made\n\nnondischargeable,  and on  that  issue  the same  legislative\n\nhistory may be more confusing than helpful.  Id.1\n                                               \n\n     In  all events,  even if  Congress never  considered the\n\npoint  one way  or  the  other,  the  outcome  is  the  same.\n\nCongress enacted  a  detailed  statute  without  an  explicit\n\ndamage requirement.  In the  face of conflicting policies for\n\nand against, there is no warrant for the court to  add such a\n\nrequirement.  Accordingly, there is no need here to weigh the\n\nbank's evidence or disturb the  bankruptcy judge's conclusion\n\nthat there was no detriment, in  the sense he used the  term,\n\nso far as  the $99,000 is  concerned.   Instead we hold  that\n\ndetriment  or damage  in  that  sense  is  not  required  for\n\nnondischargeability.

After the\n\nbill  emerged  from   a  House-Senate  Conference  Committee,\n\nSection   523(a)(2)(B) was  explained to  both the House  and\n\nSenate in the following terms:\n\n             In many cases,  a creditor is required\n          by state law to refinance existing credit\n          on which  there has been no  default.  If\n          the creditor does not forfeit remedies or\n          otherwise  rely  to  his  detriment  on a\n          false financial statement with respect to\n          existing   credit,   then  an   extension\n          renewal, or refinancing of such credit is\n          nondischargeable  only  to the  extent of\n          the  new  money  advanced; on  the  other\n          hand, if  an existing loan is  in default\n          or  the   creditor  otherwise  reasonably\n          relies  to  his   detriment  on  a  false\n          financial  statement  with  regard to  an\n          existing  loan, then  the entire  debt is\n          nondischargeable       under      section\n          523(a)(2)(B).       This   codifies   the\n          reasoning expressed by the second circuit\n          in In  re Danns, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"346954\"><a href=\"/opinion/346954/in-re-keith-orin-danns-aka-keith-o-danns-aka-keith-danns-bankrupt/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">114</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(2d [C]ir.\n                         \n          1977).\n\n124 Cong. Rec. 24, 32399 (1978) (statement of  Rep. Edwards),\n\n124  Cong.   Rec.  25,   33998  (1978)  (statement   of  Sen.\n\nDeConcini).    We  do  not find  this  general  language very\n\nhelpful in resolving the present case--there was no state law\n\nhere requiring  refinancing and,  while the $99,000  loan was\n\nnot \"in default,\" Goodrich's debt to Shawmut was repayable on\n\ndemand.  Further, we  regard the floor discussion more  as an\n\n                             -12-\n\nattempt  to explain and approve Danns than as a general gloss\n                                     \n\non the statute.\n\n     Nevertheless,  the  floor  statements  are  pretty  good\n\nevidence  that  Congress  approved  of  Danns  and,  on  that\n                                             \n\nassumption, it is appropriate to measure our case against the\n\nrationale of Danns.  The Second Circuit's holding  was framed\n                  \n\nas an  interpretation of  the \"reliance\" requirement  that is\n\nexplicit in the  statute.   The court said  that the  finance\n\ncompany did not \"rely\"  on the false statement in  continuing\n\nthe original loan because the old loan was not up for renewal\n\nat  the  time  of  the  new   loan,  and  the  old  loan  was\n\nconsolidated and  renewed solely  because of New  York's \"one\n\nloan\" law.  Danns may have depended also on the court's sense\n                 \n\nof  fairness.   After all,  whatever the  causal relationship\n\nbetween  the false statement and the renewal of the old loan,\n\nit  was sheer accident--a twist of New York law--that the old\n\nuntainted loan was renewed rather than left alone.\n\n     By  contrast, Goodrich's loan expired in September 1987,\n\nand then again in September 1988, unless renewed.  It was the\n\nbank that  called for  the financial statement  prior to  the\n\nSeptember 1987 renewal, presumably because it had an interest\n\nin managing the line of credit and the $99,000 loan.   So far\n\nas  appears,  the later  draw  down  of $10,000  more,  which\n\noccurred  in  late  1988, was  not  an  issue  when the  bank\n\naccepted the  false financial statement and  considered it in\n\n                             -13-\n\nrenewing  the loan in 1987.   Here, the  evidence showed that\n\nthe bank did \"rely\" on the false statement in renewing a loan\n\nthat would otherwise have fallen  due.  Accordingly, we think\n\nthat Danns is distinguishable in both letter and spirit.  \n          \n\n     We therefore  vacate the judgment of  the district court\n                         \n\nand remand to the bankruptcy court with directions to include\n          \n\nthe $99,000  original  loan  in the  amount  of  debt  deemed\n\nnondischargeable, together with the later  $10,000 loan whose\n\nstatus  is undisputed.  The  question of what  costs and fees\n\nare  appropriately due to Shawmut is not before us, and we do\n\nnot address it.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n                      \n\n                             -14-\n</pre>",
