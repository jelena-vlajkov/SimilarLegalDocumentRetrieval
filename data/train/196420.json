Brooks  Drug notified  the\r\n\ntrial  judge of these facts  and moved to  dismiss with prejudice\r\n\nthe  state  court action,  on  the grounds  that  appellants were\r\n\njudicially estopped  from asserting pre-petition claims that were\r\n\nnot disclosed  during the bankruptcy case.  Subsequently, on July\r\n\n27,  1993,  the state  court stayed  the  state court  action and\r\n\nordered Brooks Drug to  notify the Trustee about its  pendency in\r\n\norder to  give the Trustee the opportunity to bring the matter to\r\n\nthe attention of the bankruptcy court.  \r\n\n          On September 17, 1993, the bankruptcy court granted the\r\n\nTrustee's motion to reopen appellants' Chapter 7 case in order to\r\n\nadminister  the unscheduled  state court  action.   On  March 24,\r\n\n1994,  the  bankruptcy  court  granted the  Trustee's  motion  to\r\n\ncompromise the state court action for $10,000.  The U.S. District\r\n\nCourt for  the District of Massachusetts  affirmed the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt's  decision   on  February  17,  1995,   finding  that  the\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nbankruptcy court did  not abuse its  discretion in approving  the\r\n\ncompromise.  \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          On an appeal from  the district court, we independently\r\n\nreview  the bankruptcy  court's  decision, applying  the  clearly\r\n\nerroneous standard to its findings of fact and de  novo review to\r                                                                 \r\n\nits conclusions of  law.

The approval  of a\r\n\ncompromise  is  within the  sound  discretion  of the  bankruptcy\r\n\njudge,  however, and this court  will not overturn  a decision to\r\n\napprove  a compromise absent a clear  showing that the bankruptcy\r\n\njudge abused her discretion.

In re Anolik, 107 B.R. 426, 429 (D. Mass. 1989).\r                                \r\n\n          After  a  careful  review   of  the  record,  and  upon\r\n\nconsideration of the  briefs and  oral arguments  of counsel,  we\r\n\nfind  no abuse  of  discretion by  the  bankruptcy court  in  its\r\n\napproval  of the  compromise.   As the  district court  held, the\r\n\nrecord  reveals that  before  the bankruptcy  court approved  the\r\n\nTrustee's   compromise  proposal,  it   spent  considerable  time\r\n\nevaluating three of  the four factors set  forth in In  re Anolik\r                                                                           \r\n\nwhen  it assessed  the  value to  the  estate of  the  compromise\r\n\nproposal. \r\n\n          Although  nothing  more   need  be  said,  we   respond\r\n\nspecifically to two of appellants' arguments.  Both arguments are\r\n\nbased on their claim that they, and their attorney, discussed the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nstate court action with the Trustee on March 23, 1992, during the\r\n\ncreditors' meeting held pursuant to 11 U.S.C.   341, and that the\r\n\nTrustee determined the case had no value.\r\n\n          First,  appellants essentially  contend that  the state\r\n\ncourt action was \"abandoned\" to  appellants by operation of  law,\r\n\nwithin the meaning of 11 U.S.C.   554(c), because the Trustee had\r\n\nactual knowledge  of the state court action when the report of no\r\n\nassets was filed.  In support of finding abandonment by operation\r\n\nof law, appellants also point to their claimed oral disclosure as\r\n\nevidencing a lack of fraud and to the Trustee's zero-valuation. \r\n\n          Despite  appellants' persistent  claims, we  agree with\r\n\nthe district court that the alleged discussion with  the Trustee,\r\n\neven if true, has no bearing on  the outcome of this appeal.  The\r\n\nlaw is abundantly clear that the burden is on the debtors to list\r\n\nthe asset and/or  amend their  schedules, and that  in order  for\r\n\nproperty  to  be abandoned  by operation  of  law pursuant  to 11\r\n\nU.S.C.   554(c),  the debtor must formally schedule  the property\r\n\npursuant to  11 U.S.C.    521(1)  before the close  of the  case.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  In re Rothwell,  159 B.R.  374, 377 (Bankr.  D. Mass.\r                                    \r\n\n1993).3\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Furthermore, by operation of 11  U.S.C.   554(c) and (d), any\r\nasset  not properly  scheduled remains  property of  the bankrupt\r\nestate, and  the debtor loses all rights to enforce it in his own\r\nname.

Navistar  Int'l Transportation  Co., 950\r                                                                      \r\nF.2d 524, 526  (8th Cir. 1991)  (Chapter 7 debtor  who failed  to\r\nschedule  potential  claim  cannot  prosecute  the  claim   after\r\nemerging from bankruptcy).\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          What matters  here is not what the  appellants or their\r\n\ncounsel said,  it is  what they  did or,  rather, failed to  do.4\r\n\nThe state court action was not  scheduled as an asset at any time\r\n\nduring the bankruptcy proceedings.  There   is  simply   no  such\r\n\nconcept  of  \"assumed  abandonment,\"  which  is  essentially what\r\n\nappellants ask us to find.  Id.

M.D. Tenn. 1983) (court does not have to address factual\r\n\nquestion of  trustee's knowledge because    554 makes  clear when\r\n\nabandonment  occurs).   Neither  the  bankruptcy  court, nor  the\r\n\ndistrict  court,  abused  their  discretion  when  they  rejected\r\n\nappellants' abandonment claim.5 \r\n\n          Second, appellants  contend that because  their alleged\r\n\noral  disclosure  disproves any  intent  to commit  fraud  on the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  We note, again,  that throughout the state court  action begun\r\nin 1990 and the  Chapter 7 proceedings begun in  1992, appellants\r\nwere represented by the same attorney.  This fact alone amplifies\r\n\"'the  silence'  in  [appellants'] bankruptcy  record  concerning\r\n[their  state  court   action],  [which]  as  they   say  in  the\r\nvernacular, 'is deafening'.\"   Payless, 989 F.2d at  571 (quoting\r                                                                           \r\nOneida Motor Freight, 848 F.2d at 417). \r                              \r\n\n5  In  a similar vein, appellants  also contend that their  state\r\ncourt action  would be exempt from  the Chapter 7 estate.   It is\r\nwell settled in this Circuit  that \"theories not raised  squarely\r\nin the  district court cannot be  surfaced for the  first time on\r\nappeal.\" McCoy v.

Appellants contend that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion when it approved the Chapter 7 Trustee's motion to compromise the claim.  For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 1992, appellants filed a petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 701 et seq.  (1988), and John O. Desmond, an appellee in this case, was appointed the Chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Trustee\").  As required by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 521(1), appellants filed a statement of financial affairs and schedule of assets and liabilities.  Appellants failed to schedule as an asset, however, a pending state court action they commenced in 1990 against Brooks Drug, Inc., (\"Brooks Drug\") (also an appellee in this case), seeking damages for alleged discrimination against John J. Jeffrey in employment, under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 12, Secs. 11H, I, and the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Trustee filed a Report of No Assets on May 1, 1992, appellants received a discharge under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 727(b), and their Chapter 7 case was closed on June 22, 1992.  Appellants' counsel, who represented appellants in both the state court action and the Chapter 7 proceedings, never informed the state court or Brooks Drug that appellants had filed for bankruptcy or had received a discharge without administration of the state court action in the Chapter 7 proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 10, 1993, on the eve of trial in state court, Brooks Drug learned of appellants' bankruptcy and their failure to schedule the state court action.  Brooks Drug notified the trial judge of these facts and moved to dismiss with prejudice the state court action, on the grounds that appellants were judicially estopped from asserting pre-petition claims that were not disclosed during the bankruptcy case.  Subsequently, on July 27, 1993, the state court stayed the state court action and ordered Brooks Drug to notify the Trustee about its pendency in order to give the Trustee the opportunity to bring the matter to the attention of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 17, 1993, the bankruptcy court granted the Trustee's motion to reopen appellants' Chapter 7 case in order to administer the unscheduled state court action.  On March 24, 1994, the bankruptcy court granted the Trustee's motion to compromise the state court action for $10,000.  The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision on February 17, 1995, finding that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in approving the compromise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal from the district court, we independently review the bankruptcy court's decision, applying the clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact and de novo review to its conclusions of law.  In re SPM Mfg. Corp., 984 F.2d 1305, 1311 (1st Cir.1993);  see also In re G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d 1467, 1474 (1st Cir.1991) (collecting cases).  The approval of a compromise is within the sound discretion of the bankruptcy judge, however, and this court will not overturn a decision to approve a compromise absent a clear showing that the bankruptcy judge abused her discretion.  In re Anolik, 107 B.R. 426, 429 (D.Mass.1989) (collecting cases).  \"The cask which encases a judge's discretion, though commodious, can be shattered when a reviewing tribunal is persuaded that the trial court misconceived or misapplied the law, or misconstrued its own rules.\"  Aggarwal v. Ponce School of Medicine, 745 F.2d 723, 727 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bankruptcy judge has the authority to approve a compromise of a claim pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The ultimate issue on appeal is whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion when it approved the compromise, which is a process requiring the bankruptcy court to \"assess and balance the value of the claim that is being compromised against the value to the estate of the acceptance of the compromise proposal.\"  In re GHR Cos., 50 B.R. 925, 931 (Bankr.D.Mass.1985) (quoting In re Boston &amp; Providence R.R., 673 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir.1982)).  The specific factors which a bankruptcy court considers when making this determination include:  (i) the probability of success in the litigation being compromised;  (ii) the difficulties, if any, to be encountered in the matter of collection;  (iii) the complexity of the litigation involved, and the expense, inconvenience and delay attending it;  and, (iv) the paramount interest of the creditors and a proper deference to their reasonable views in the premise.  In re Anolik, 107 B.R. 426, 429 (D.Mass.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a careful review of the record, and upon consideration of the briefs and oral arguments of counsel, we find no abuse of discretion by the bankruptcy court in its approval of the compromise.  As the district court held, the record reveals that before the bankruptcy court approved the Trustee's compromise proposal, it spent considerable time evaluating three of the four factors set forth in In re Anolik when it assessed the value to the estate of the compromise proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although nothing more need be said, we respond specifically to two of appellants' arguments.  Both arguments are based on their claim that they, and their attorney, discussed the state court action with the Trustee on March 23, 1992, during the creditors' meeting held pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 341, and that the Trustee determined the case had no value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, appellants essentially contend that the state court action was \"abandoned\" to appellants by operation of law, within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 554(c), because the Trustee had actual knowledge of the state court action when the report of no assets was filed.  In support of finding abandonment by operation of law, appellants also point to their claimed oral disclosure as evidencing a lack of fraud and to the Trustee's zero-valuation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite appellants' persistent claims, we agree with the district court that the alleged discussion with the Trustee, even if true, has no bearing on the outcome of this appeal.  The law is abundantly clear that the burden is on the debtors to list the asset and/or amend their schedules, and that in order for property to be abandoned by operation of law pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 554(c), the debtor must formally schedule the property pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 521(1) before the close of the case.  See, e.g., In re Rothwell, 159 B.R. 374, 377 (Bankr.D.Mass.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What matters here is not what the appellants or their counsel said, it is what they did or, rather, failed to do.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The state court action was not scheduled as an asset at any time during the bankruptcy proceedings.  There is simply no such concept of \"assumed abandonment,\" which is essentially what appellants ask us to find.  Id. (citing Vreugdenhill, 950 F.2d at 526 (\"It is not enough that the trustee learns of the property through other means;  the property must be scheduled pursuant to [11 U.S.C.] Sec. 521(1).\"));   see also In re Medley, 29 B.R. 84, 86 (Bankr.M.D.Tenn.1983) (court does not have to address factual question of trustee's knowledge because Sec. 554 makes clear when abandonment occurs).  Neither the bankruptcy court, nor the district court, abused their discretion when they rejected appellants' abandonment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellants contend that because their alleged oral disclosure disproves any intent to commit fraud on the bankruptcy proceedings, their state court action would not be dismissed under our decision in Payless Wholesale Distribs., Inc. v. Alberto Culver, Inc., 989 F.2d 570 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 344, 126 L.Ed.2d 309 (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without ruling on the merits of whether Payless, by itself, would justify dismissal, we find no abuse of discretion by the bankruptcy court when it found that there was \"some likelihood\" Brooks Drug would prevail in state court based on a Payless defense.  In addition, we find no abuse of discretion by the bankruptcy court when it took Payless into consideration as one of the factors it weighed when it assessed the likelihood of appellants' success were appellants to proceed with the state court action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We merely add that appellants' argument that they brought the state court action to the Trustee's attention completely overlooks both the importance of the Bankruptcy Code's disclosure requirements and the fact that appellants signed the schedules under penalties of perjury.  Oneida, 848 F.2d at 416;  In re Giguere, 165 B.R. 531, 536 (Bankr.D.R.I.1994).  Furthermore, whether or not appellants' initial failure to schedule the state court asset was intentional, the glaring fact remains that, but for the investigation made by counsel for Brooks Drug, appellants' failure to list on the schedule the state court action at any time during the bankruptcy proceedings would never have come to the attention of the state court, the bankruptcy court, or the Trustee.  As we have already noted, appellants' \"silence\" here is thoroughly \"deafening.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, assuming arguendo that appellants' state court action was not precluded under Payless, appellants' argument would not affect the outcome of this appeal.  Even without considering the possibility of dismissal under Payless, the record nonetheless reveals a \"serious question\" regarding appellants' likelihood of success.  In re Anolik, 107 B.R. at 430.   This, coupled with the bankruptcy court's inquiries and findings regarding the inconvenience and expense to the estate in attending the state court action, and the fact that the compromise would provide creditors with an immediate and certain payment of a large percentage of the outstanding debt, illustrates that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in approving the compromise.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, and having found no merit to appellants' other arguments, we affirm the district court's decision, finding no abuse of discretion by the bankruptcy court in its approval of the compromise.  Finally, because we view this appeal to have been frivolous, we impose double costs on appellants.  The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See 11 U.S.C.

It is well settled in this Circuit that \"theories not raised squarely in the district court cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal.\"  McCoy v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.1991).  We therefore treat this argument as unpreserved for appellate review.

Appellants contend that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion when it approved the Chapter 7 Trustee's motion to compromise the claim.  For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 1992, appellants filed a petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 701 et seq.  (1988), and John O. Desmond, an appellee in this case, was appointed the Chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Trustee\").  As required by 11 U.S.C. Sec. 521(1), appellants filed a statement of financial affairs and schedule of assets and liabilities.  Appellants failed to schedule as an asset, however, a pending state court action they commenced in 1990 against Brooks Drug, Inc., (\"Brooks Drug\") (also an appellee in this case), seeking damages for alleged discrimination against John J. Jeffrey in employment, under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 12, Secs. 11H, I, and the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Trustee filed a Report of No Assets on May 1, 1992, appellants received a discharge under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 727(b), and their Chapter 7 case was closed on June 22, 1992.  Appellants' counsel, who represented appellants in both the state court action and the Chapter 7 proceedings, never informed the state court or Brooks Drug that appellants had filed for bankruptcy or had received a discharge without administration of the state court action in the Chapter 7 proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 10, 1993, on the eve of trial in state court, Brooks Drug learned of appellants' bankruptcy and their failure to schedule the state court action.  Brooks Drug notified the trial judge of these facts and moved to dismiss with prejudice the state court action, on the grounds that appellants were judicially estopped from asserting pre-petition claims that were not disclosed during the bankruptcy case.  Subsequently, on July 27, 1993, the state court stayed the state court action and ordered Brooks Drug to notify the Trustee about its pendency in order to give the Trustee the opportunity to bring the matter to the attention of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 17, 1993, the bankruptcy court granted the Trustee's motion to reopen appellants' Chapter 7 case in order to administer the unscheduled state court action.  On March 24, 1994, the bankruptcy court granted the Trustee's motion to compromise the state court action for $10,000.  The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision on February 17, 1995, finding that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in approving the compromise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal from the district court, we independently review the bankruptcy court's decision, applying the clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact and de novo review to its conclusions of law.  In re SPM Mfg. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599258\"><a href=\"/opinion/599258/in-re-spm-manufacturing-corporation-debtor-official-unsecured-creditors/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span>, 1311 (1st Cir.1993);  see also In re G.S.F.

The approval of a compromise is within the sound discretion of the bankruptcy judge, however, and this court will not overturn a decision to approve a compromise absent a clear showing that the bankruptcy judge abused her discretion.  In re Anolik, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1920399\"><a href=\"/opinion/1920399/in-re-anolik/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 429 (D.Mass.1989) (collecting cases).  \"The cask which encases a judge's discretion, though commodious, can be shattered when a reviewing tribunal is persuaded that the trial court misconceived or misapplied the law, or misconstrued its own rules.\"  Aggarwal v.

The specific factors which a bankruptcy court considers when making this determination include:  (i) the probability of success in the litigation being compromised;  (ii) the difficulties, if any, to be encountered in the matter of collection;  (iii) the complexity of the litigation involved, and the expense, inconvenience and delay attending it;  and, (iv) the paramount interest of the creditors and a proper deference to their reasonable views in the premise.  In re Anolik, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1920399\"><a href=\"/opinion/1920399/in-re-anolik/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 429 (D.Mass.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a careful review of the record, and upon consideration of the briefs and oral arguments of counsel, we find no abuse of discretion by the bankruptcy court in its approval of the compromise.  As the district court held, the record reveals that before the bankruptcy court approved the Trustee's compromise proposal, it spent considerable time evaluating three of the four factors set forth in In re Anolik when it assessed the value to the estate of the compromise proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although nothing more need be said, we respond specifically to two of appellants' arguments.  Both arguments are based on their claim that they, and their attorney, discussed the state court action with the Trustee on March 23, 1992, during the creditors' meeting held pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 341, and that the Trustee determined the case had no value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, appellants essentially contend that the state court action was \"abandoned\" to appellants by operation of law, within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. Sec. 554(c), because the Trustee had actual knowledge of the state court action when the report of no assets was filed.  In support of finding abandonment by operation of law, appellants also point to their claimed oral disclosure as evidencing a lack of fraud and to the Trustee's zero-valuation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite appellants' persistent claims, we agree with the district court that the alleged discussion with the Trustee, even if true, has no bearing on the outcome of this appeal.  The law is abundantly clear that the burden is on the debtors to list the asset and/or amend their schedules, and that in order for property to be abandoned by operation of law pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 554(c), the debtor must formally schedule the property pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 521(1) before the close of the case.  See, e.g., In re Rothwell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1547239\"><a href=\"/opinion/1547239/in-re-rothwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 377 (Bankr.D.Mass.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What matters here is not what the appellants or their counsel said, it is what they did or, rather, failed to do.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The state court action was not scheduled as an asset at any time during the bankruptcy proceedings.  There is simply no such concept of \"assumed abandonment,\" which is essentially what appellants ask us to find.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1547239\"><a href=\"/opinion/1547239/in-re-rothwell/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (citing Vreugdenhill, </a></span>950 F.2d at 526 (\"It is not enough that the trustee learns of the property through other means;  the property must be scheduled pursuant to [11 U.S.C.] Sec. 521(1).\"));   see also In re Medley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1871950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1871950/in-re-medley/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 86 (Bankr.M.D.Tenn.1983) (court does not have to address factual question of trustee's knowledge because Sec. 554 makes clear when abandonment occurs).  Neither the bankruptcy court, nor the district court, abused their discretion when they rejected appellants' abandonment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellants contend that because their alleged oral disclosure disproves any intent to commit fraud on the bankruptcy proceedings, their state court action would not be dismissed under our decision in Payless Wholesale Distribs., Inc. v. Alberto Culver, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603507\"><a href=\"/opinion/603507/1993-1-trade-cases-p-70178-bankr-l-rep-p-75211-payless-wholesale/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span> </span>(1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without ruling on the merits of whether Payless, by itself, would justify dismissal, we find no abuse of discretion by the bankruptcy court when it found that there was \"some likelihood\" Brooks Drug would prevail in state court based on a Payless defense.  In addition, we find no abuse of discretion by the bankruptcy court when it took Payless into consideration as one of the factors it weighed when it assessed the likelihood of appellants' success were appellants to proceed with the state court action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We merely add that appellants' argument that they brought the state court action to the Trustee's attention completely overlooks both the importance of the Bankruptcy Code's disclosure requirements and the fact that appellants signed the schedules under penalties of perjury.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Oneida,</span> <span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">416</span></span>;  In re Giguere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1942556\"><a href=\"/opinion/1942556/in-re-giguere/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 536 (Bankr.D.R.I.1994).  Furthermore, whether or not appellants' initial failure to schedule the state court asset was intentional, the glaring fact remains that, but for the investigation made by counsel for Brooks Drug, appellants' failure to list on the schedule the state court action at any time during the bankruptcy proceedings would never have come to the attention of the state court, the bankruptcy court, or the Trustee.  As we have already noted, appellants' \"silence\" here is thoroughly \"deafening.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, assuming arguendo that appellants' state court action was not precluded under Payless, appellants' argument would not affect the outcome of this appeal.  Even without considering the possibility of dismissal under Payless, the record nonetheless reveals a \"serious question\" regarding appellants' likelihood of success.  In re <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1920399\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Anolik,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1920399/in-re-anolik/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> at <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>.   This, coupled with the bankruptcy court's inquiries and findings regarding the inconvenience and expense to the estate in attending the state court action, and the fact that the compromise would provide creditors with an immediate and certain payment of a large percentage of the outstanding debt, illustrates that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in approving the compromise.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, and having found no merit to appellants' other arguments, we affirm the district court's decision, finding no abuse of discretion by the bankruptcy court in its approval of the compromise.  Finally, because we view this appeal to have been frivolous, we impose double costs on appellants.  The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See 11 U.S.C.
