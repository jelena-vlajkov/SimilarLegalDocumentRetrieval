In 1994  one of her associates was  indicted and\n\nher substantial cooperation, pursuant  to a supplemental plea\n\nagreement, resulted  in his conviction.   The court rejected,\n\nhowever,  the government's  motion for  the reduction  of her\n\nsentence therefor  under Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b), holding that\n\nit was  without jurisdiction1  to grant the  requested relief\n\nbecause  this cooperation took  place more than  a year after\n\nsentencing and was based  upon information she possessed from\n\nthe  beginning.   Under the rule  such cooperation  cannot be\n\nconsidered  unless the  information  was \"not  known\" to  the\n\ndefendant  until one  year  or more  after imposition  of the\n\nsentence.2  The district court\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.

The court,  on motion of\n          the Government made within one year after\n          the  imposition  of  the   sentence,  may\n          reduce   a   sentence   to    reflect   a\n          defendant's    subsequent,    substantial\n          assistance   in   the  investigation   or\n          prosecution  of  another  person who  has\n          committed an offense, in  accordance with\n          the  guidelines   and  policy  statements\n          issued   by  the   Sentencing  Commission\n          pursuant  to section  994  of  title  28,\n          United  States  Code.     The  court  may\n          consider a government motion to  reduce a\n          sentence  made one  year  or  more  after\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nread \"not known\" literally; we read it more broadly.\n\n          Rule  35(b)   has   gone  through   a   series   of\n\nliberalizations.  The time limit  was originally but 60 days,\n\nthen  120 days,  then one year;  and, at  first not  only the\n\ngovernment's motion,  but even  the court's  order had  to be\n\nentered within the  time limit.  See Fed. R.  Crim. P. 35, 18\r                                                \n\nU.S.C.A., and  amendments thereto,  1966, 1987, 1991.   Until\n\nnow, the concept was limited  to cooperation before, or  soon\n\nafter, the sentencing.  At issue is the  exception to the one\n\nyear time bar introduced in 1991.\n\n          Manifestly,  the  purpose  for  denying   value  to\n\nretained knowledge  is to  induce immediate full  disclosure.\n\nIf, however, a defendant had not disclosed information simply\n\nbecause  she was not asked,  or was otherwise  unaware of its\n\nvalue,  there is no reason she  should be restricted; nothing\n\nwould  be served by rejecting  later use when  a value became\n\napparent.   Rather, to deny  a benefit to  late disclosure in\n\nsuch circumstances  would be contrary to  the rule's purpose.\n\nThe Advisory Committee notes  to the 1991 amendment  speak of\n\ninformation \"useful to the government.\"  This appears to be a\n\nnovel  question, but we hold that until becoming aware of its\n\n                    \r                                \n\n          imposition  of  the  sentence  where  the\n          defendant's     substantial    assistance\n          involves  information   or  evidence  not\n          known by the defendant until one  year or\n          more after imposition of sentence.\n\nFed.

We,\n\naccordingly, reverse the denial of  the motion and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent herewith.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
