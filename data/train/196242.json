This case  involves the validity of a forum\r                           \r\n\nselection clause in a construction subcontract.  Appellee G &amp;\r\n\nC Enterprises, Inc., was the general contractor on a  project\r\n\nto construct  a jet fuel  storage and distribution  system at\r\n\nBangor  International  Airport  for  the  military.    G &amp;  C\r\n\nsubcontracted  work  on  two large  fuel  tanks  to appellant\r\n\nPittsburgh  Tank  &amp;  Tower,  Inc. for  an  agreed  payment of\r\n\n$343,000.    Pittsburgh  Tank  agreed  to  complete  discrete\r\n\nportions of its work in  accord with deadlines spelled out in\r\n\nthe  subcontract,  and  to  indemnify  G &amp;  C  for  any  loss\r\n\nresulting from delays caused by Pittsburgh Tank.\r\n\n     Pittsburgh  Tank completed its work but, contending that\r\n\nPittsburgh  Tank had  failed to  meet  its deadlines,  G &amp;  C\r\n\nretained approximately $120,000 from the contract price.  \r\n\nPittsburgh  Tank  then  filed  the  instant  action  for  the\r\n\n$120,000  in federal  district court  in  Maine, asserting  a\r\n\nclaim against G &amp; C for breach of the subcontract and a claim\r\n\non G &amp;  C's payment bond  under the Miller  Act, 40 U.S.C.   \r\n\n270b.     The  Miller  Act  bond  protects  contractors  (and\r\n\nsubcontractors)  who have furnished  labor or materials  on a\r\n\nfederal construction project,  and a suit on the  bond can be\r\n\nbrought in  federal court.   United States ex rel  Sherman v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCarter, 353 U.S. 210 (1957).\r                  \r\n\n     G &amp; C moved  to dismiss for improper venue, relying on a\r\n\nforum  selection clause  in  the subcontract,  which provided\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nthat \"venue  of all  suits arising  against CONTRACTOR  under\r\n\nthis contract shall  be in Burlington County[,  New Jersey].\"\r\n\nPittsburgh Tank  argued that  the Miller  Act's venue  clause\r\n\ntrumped the contrary venue provision in the subcontract.  The\r\n\nMiller Act states that suit is to be brought \"in any district\r\n\nin which  the contract was  to be performed and  executed and\r\n\nnot elsewhere . . .  .\"  40 U.S.C.   270b(b).  The magistrate\r\n\njudge  and  the  district court  rejected  Pittsburgh  Tank's\r\n\nargument  and  dismissed the  complaint  for  improper venue.\r\n\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\n     Pittsburgh  Tank contends that  the venue clause  in the\r\n\nMiller Act is jurisdictional, and the parties cannot contract\r\n\naround it.   The provision for venue in  a particular federal\r\n\ncourt \"and not elsewhere\" could  be taken as a statement that\r\n\nno other federal court has  jurisdiction to hear a Miller Act\r\n\nclaim.    In  the  past, lower  federal  courts  took varying\r\n\npositions on the import of this ambiguous clause.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nGigliello v. Sovereign Constr. Co. Ltd., 311 F. Supp. 371 (D.\r                                                   \r\n\nMass.  1970)  (interpreting  the clause  as  jurisdictional);\r\n\nVermont Marble Co.  v. Roscoe-Ajax Constr. Co.,  246 F. Supp.\r                                                          \r\n\n439  (N.D. Cal. 1965)  (discussing the \"divergence  of views\"\r\n\nabout the meaning of the venue clause).\r\n\n     The  Supreme Court, however,  seems to have  settled the\r\n\nquestion in F.D. Rich Co.  v. Industrial Lumber Co., 417 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n116 (1974).  In the course of deciding a venue question  in a\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nMiller Act case,  the Court said that the  statutory language\r\n\nin question was \"merely a venue requirement.\"  Id. at 124-26.\r                                                              \r\n\nMost  of the  cases after  Rich have  said that  the disputed\r                                           \r\n\nprovision  is simply  a  venue  statute.   See,  e.g., In  re\r                                                                         \r\n\nFireman's Fund  Ins. Cos., 588  F.2d 93, 95 (5th  Cir. 1979);\r                                     \r\n\nArrow  Plumbing &amp;  Heating, Inc.  v.  North Amer.  Mechanical\r                                                                         \r\n\nServs. Corp., 810 F. Supp. 369, 370 (D.R.I. 1993).\r                        \r\n\n     Under conventional venue statutes, venue provisions have\r\n\nlong been subject to contractual waiver through a valid forum\r\n\nselection agreement.  See, e.g., National Equip. Rental. Ltd.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Szukhent,  375 U.S. 311  (1964).  Pittsburgh Tank  has not\r                       \r\n\nargued  that the  selection  clause  in  the  subcontract  is\r\n\ninvalid under traditional  standards (e.g., for fraud).   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nFireman's Fund Amer. Ins. Co. v. Puerto Rican Forwarding Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n492  F.2d 1294, 1297 (1st Cir. 1974).  And although the forum\r\n\nselection  clause here  refers to  a  county that  apparently\r\n\ncontains  no federal  court, both  parties  have treated  the\r\n\nclause as providing for  venue in the federal  district court\r\n\nfor the district of New  Jersey.  Accord, Arrow Plumbing, 810\r                                                                    \r\n\nF. Supp. at 370.\r\n\n     We agree  with appellant that the Supreme  Court in Rich\r                                                                         \r\n\nwas not focusing  on anything quite like the  problem in this\r\n\ncase and  Rich's venue reference  was something of  an aside.\r                          \r\n\nStill,   the  designation  is   explicit  (\"merely   a  venue\r\n\nrequirement\") and  very  hard for  a lower  federal court  to\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nignore.   Possibly  there are  reasons  why the  Miller Act's\r\n\npolicies  would warrant different standards for waiver of its\r\n\nvenue provisions than  the standards conventionally  applied.\r\n\nBut  no such argument  is made in  this case, so  we need not\r\n\npursue that issue here.\r\n\n     The  only remaining  question is  whether  the dismissal\r\n\nshould  be  affirmed  or  the  case  should be  remanded  for\r\n\ntransfer  to a  New  Jersey district  court,  pursuant to  28\r\n\nU.S.C.    1406(a).  No such request  was made to the district\r\n\ncourt or in  Pittsburgh Tank's brief in  this court.   But it\r\n\nemerged at oral argument that the special one-year statute of\r\n\nlimitations may  have run under  the Miller Act, 40  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2706(b); counsel for G  &amp; C is to  be commended for  advising\r\n\nthe court that such a problem may exist.  However, it appears\r\n\nthat  Pittsburgh Tank may still  sue on the subcontract under\r\n\nstate  law  without  the  Miller  Act claim.    There  is  no\r\n\nindication that the general contractor is insolvent.\r\n\n     Under  these  circumstances, we  affirm  outright rather\r\n\nthan remanding for  consideration of a transfer.   It is rare\r\n\nin a civil action to afford relief not requested in the trial\r\n\ncourt  and,  at  a  minimum,  further  proceedings  would  be\r\n\nrequired in the district court to allow  G &amp; C an opportunity\r\n\nto argue against transfer.  Since Pittsburgh Tank's state-law\r\n\ncontract claim apparently remains intact, we see no equitable\r\n\nreason for a remand.   Pittsburgh Tank is free to pursue  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nmatter in the district court under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), but\r\n\nwe express no views on the merits of such an endeavor.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n",

The Miller Act bond protects contractors (and subcontractors) who have furnished labor or materials on a federal construction project, and a suit on the bond can be brought in federal court.

In the course of deciding a venue question in a Miller Act case, the Court said that the statutory language in question was \"merely a venue requirement.\"  Id. at 124-26, 94 S.Ct. at 2162-64.   Most of the cases after Rich have said that the disputed provision is simply a venue statute.  See, e.g., In re Fireman's Fund Ins.

Appellee G &amp; C Enterprises, Inc., was the general contractor on a project to construct a jet fuel storage and distribution system at Bangor International Airport for the military.  G &amp; C subcontracted work on two large fuel tanks to appellant Pittsburgh Tank &amp; Tower, Inc. for an agreed payment of $343,000.  Pittsburgh Tank agreed to complete discrete portions of its work in accord with deadlines spelled out in the subcontract, and to indemnify G &amp; C for any loss resulting from delays caused by Pittsburgh Tank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pittsburgh Tank completed its work but, contending that Pittsburgh Tank had failed to meet its deadlines, G &amp; C retained approximately $120,000 from the contract price.  Pittsburgh Tank then filed the instant action for the $120,000 in federal district court in Maine, asserting a claim against G &amp; C for breach of the subcontract and a claim on G &amp; C's payment bond under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. Sec. 270b.  The Miller Act bond protects contractors (and subcontractors) who have furnished labor or materials on a federal construction project, and a suit on the bond can be brought in federal court.

The Miller Act states that suit is to be brought \"for any district in which the contract was to be performed and executed and not elsewhere....\"  40 U.S.C. Sec. 270b(b).  The magistrate judge and the district court rejected Pittsburgh Tank's argument and dismissed the complaint for improper venue.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pittsburgh Tank contends that the venue clause in the Miller Act is jurisdictional, and the parties cannot contract around it.  The provision for venue in a particular federal court \"and not elsewhere\" could be taken as a statement that no other federal court has jurisdiction to hear a Miller Act claim.  In the past, lower federal courts took varying positions on the import of this ambiguous clause.  See, e.g., Gigliello v. Sovereign Constr.  Co. Ltd., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span> </span>(D.Mass.1970) (interpreting the clause as jurisdictional);  Vermont Marble Co. v. Roscoe-Ajax Constr.  Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span> </span>(N.D.Cal.1965) (discussing the \"divergence of views\" about the meaning of the venue clause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, however, seems to have settled the question in F.D. Rich Co. v. Industrial Lumber Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109048\"><a href=\"/opinion/109048/fd-rich-co-v-united-states-ex-rel-industrial-lumber-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109048\"><a href=\"/opinion/109048/fd-rich-co-v-united-states-ex-rel-industrial-lumber-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span> </a></span>(1974).  In the course of deciding a venue question in a Miller Act case, the Court said that the statutory language in question was \"merely a venue requirement.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109048\"><a href=\"/opinion/109048/fd-rich-co-v-united-states-ex-rel-industrial-lumber-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 124-26, </a></span>94 S.Ct. at 2162-64.   Most of the cases after Rich have said that the disputed provision is simply a venue statute.  See, e.g., In re Fireman's Fund Ins. Cos., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></span>, 95 (5th Cir.1979);  Arrow Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. v. North Amer.  Mechanical Servs.  Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></span>, 370 (D.R.I.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under conventional venue statutes, venue provisions have long been subject to contractual waiver through a valid forum selection agreement.  See, e.g., National Equip.  Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106721\"><a href=\"/opinion/106721/national-equipment-rental-ltd-v-szukhent/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106721\"><a href=\"/opinion/106721/national-equipment-rental-ltd-v-szukhent/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106721\"><a href=\"/opinion/106721/national-equipment-rental-ltd-v-szukhent/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span> </a></span>(1964).  Pittsburgh Tank has not argued that the selection clause in the subcontract is invalid under traditional standards (e.g., for fraud).  See Fireman's Fund Amer.  Ins. Co. v. Puerto Rican Forwarding Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"317558\"><a href=\"/opinion/317558/firemans-fund-american-insurance-companies-v-puerto-rican-forwarding-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span>, 1297 (1st Cir.1974).  And although the forum selection clause here refers to a county that apparently contains no federal court, both parties have treated the clause as providing for venue in the federal district court for the district of New Jersey.  Accord, Arrow <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Plumbing,</span> <span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">370</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with appellant that the Supreme Court in Rich was not focusing on anything quite like the problem in this case and Rich 's venue reference was something of an aside.  Still, the designation is explicit (\"merely a venue requirement\") and very hard for a lower federal court to ignore.  Possibly there are reasons why the Miller Act's policies would warrant different standards for waiver of its venue provisions than the standards conventionally applied.  But no such argument is made in this case, so we need not pursue that issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining question is whether the dismissal should be affirmed or the case should be remanded for transfer to a New Jersey district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1406(a).  No such request was made to the district court or in Pittsburgh Tank's brief in this court.  But it emerged at oral argument that the special one-year statute of limitations may have run under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. Sec. 270b(b);  counsel for G &amp; C is to be commended for advising the court that such a problem may exist.  However, it appears that Pittsburgh Tank may still sue on the subcontract under state law without the Miller Act claim.  There is no indication that the general contractor is insolvent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we affirm outright rather than remanding for consideration of a transfer.  It is rare in a civil action to afford relief not requested in the trial court and, at a minimum, further proceedings would be required in the district court to allow G &amp; C an opportunity to argue against transfer.  Since Pittsburgh Tank's state-law contract claim apparently remains intact, we see no equitable reason for a remand.  Pittsburgh Tank is free to pursue the matter in the district court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), but we express no views on the merits of such an endeavor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
