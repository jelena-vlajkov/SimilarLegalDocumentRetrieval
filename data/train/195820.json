Stevens,  Kelly,  Remmel  &amp; Zimmerman,  on  brief  for\r                                                             \nappellee.\n\n                                         \n                       January 4, 1995\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  In March 1993, a jury returned a verdict in\r                           \n\nfavor of appellee  Dennis Bezanson, trustee of the  estate of\n\nUnitex, Inc., in his suit against Fleet Bank-NH, successor of\n\nIndian Head National Bank.  Bezanson alleged that Indian Head\n\nhad violated its duty  under New Hampshire law by  failing to\n\ndispose of the assets of Unitex in a  commercially reasonable\n\nmanner.  The jury awarded the trustee $379,779.21 in damages.\n\nUpon  Fleet's post-trial motion  for judgment as  a matter of\n\nlaw,  the  district  court  held  that,  although  sufficient\n\nevidence  supported  the  finding  of  liability,  Fleet  was\n\nentitled to judgment as  a matter of law because  the trustee\n\nhad  not proven  damages with  \"reasonable certainty.\"     On\n\nappeal,  this court  held that the  evidence was  adequate to\n\nsupport  the jury verdict both  as to the  issue of liability\n\nand  that of damages.  It therefore reversed the judgment and\n\nremanded  the  matter  to  the  district  court  for  further\n\nproceedings.  Bezanson v. Fleet Bank-NH, 29 F.3d 16 (1st Cir.\r                                                   \n\n1994).   Fleet then  moved in  the district  court for  a new\n\ntrial on the ground  that there was insufficient  evidence to\n\nsupport the verdict.   The  motion was denied  and Fleet  now\n\nappeals.\n\n     Fleet is correct that this court's decision that it  was\n\nnot entitled to judgment as a matter of law does not preclude\n\nFleet's  prevailing  on its  motion for  a  new trial  in the\n\ndistrict court.  A \"district court may order a new trial even\r                                                  \r\r\n\nwhere  the  verdict is  supported  by substantial  evidence.\"\n\nLama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 477 (1st Cir. 1994) (emphasis in\r                          \n\noriginal).   On the  other hand, \"there  is no rule  that the\n\ndistrict court  must do  so.\"   Id.  (emphasis in  original).\r                                              \n\nRather, the  decision rests  in the  discretion of  the trial\n\ncourt and this court will reverse  a denial of a motion for a\n\nnew  trial  \"only in  a  very unusual  case,\"  id. (citations\r                                                             \n\nomitted),  where  the \"verdict  is  so  clearly mistaken,  so\n\nclearly against the law  or the evidence, as to  constitute a\n\nmiscarriage of  justice,\" Levesque  v. Anchor  Motor Freight,\r                                                                         \n\nInc., 832 F.2d 702,  703 (1st Cir. 1987).   Furthermore, when\r               \n\nthe  motion for  a  new trial  rests on  the  claim that  the\n\nevidence was insufficient to support the verdict, a denial of\n\na   motion  for  a  new  trial  is  reviewed  by  a  standard\n\n\"essentially coterminous\"  with  that  used  in  reviewing  a\n\njudgment as a matter of law.  Lama, 16 F.3d at 477; Levesque,\r                                                                        \n\n832  F.2d at  703  (in  reviewing  denial  of  a  new  trial,\n\nappellate court  considers \"relevant  testimony in  the light\n\nmost flattering  to the appellees and  draw[s] all legitimate\n\ninferences in  their  favor\"); Robinson  v.  Watts  Detective\r                                                                         \n\nAgency, Inc., 685 F.2d 729, 741 (1st Cir. 1982) (motion for a\r                       \n\nnew trial based on insufficiency of evidence \"is subject to a\n\nstandard of  review as strict  as that  for a [judgment  as a\n\nmatter of law]\"), cert. denied., 459 U.S. 1105 (1983).\r                                          \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     We have reviewed the  record in this case,  the judgment\n\nof  the district court  and the parties  briefs.  Essentially\n\nfor the reasons  stated in  our earlier opinion  in which  we\n\nheld that Fleet was not entitled to a judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw, Bezanson v. Fleet Bank-NH, 29 F.3d 16, we find that  the\r                                          \n\njury verdict was not a \"miscarriage of justice.\"   Therefore,\n\nthe  judgment of  the district  court is  summarily affirmed.\r                                                                        \n\nSee  1st Cir.
