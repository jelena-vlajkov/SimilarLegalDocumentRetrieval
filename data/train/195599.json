Little, Inc. (\"ADL\") is a Cambridge-based\n\ninternational consulting  firm.   Plaintiff began  working at\n\nADL as a  management consultant on  June 7, 1981.   In  March\n\n1988, ADL's  Board  of  Director's voted  to  form  an  ESOP1\n\npursuant  to 26 U.S.C.    4975(e)(7) of  the Internal Revenue\n\nCode,  and to  propose a \"going-private\"  transaction whereby\n\nADL would 1) acquire all outstanding  publicly held shares of\n\nADL stock; 2)  cancel all  existing shares of  ADL stock;  3)\n\nreissue \"New Shares\"; and 4) sell a portion of the New Shares\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The ESOP  is an individual account plan,  i.e. \"a pension\nplan  which  provides  for  an individual  account  for  each\nparticipant  and for  benefits based  solely upon  the amount\ncontributed to  the  participant's account,  and any  income,\nexpenses, gains  and losses, and any  forfeitures of accounts\nof  other  participants  which   may  be  allocated  to  such\nparticipant's account.\"  29 U.S.C.   1102 (34). \n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nto the ESOP with  financing from ADL (which in  turn received\n\nbank financing).  Plaintiff objected to the transaction for a\n\nvariety of reasons, and delivered  to the Department of Labor\n\na thirty-two  page memorandum  detailing his belief  that, as\n\npart of the going-private transaction, the ESOP Trustees were\n\nintending  to buy  ADL  common stock  in  excess of  adequate\n\nconsideration within the  meaning of 29  U.S.C.   1002  (18).\n\nPlaintiff urged the Department of Labor to seek an injunction\n\nenjoining ADL  from consummating its plan.  The Department of\n\nLabor declined plaintiff's invitation,  and on June 14, 1988,\n\nthe  ADL  disinterested  shareholders  approved  the proposed\n\ntransaction.  \n\n          Thereafter,  the ESOP  Trustees negotiated  a $32.8\n\nmillion loan from ADL.   The agreement provided that  the to-\n\nbe-purchased ADL stock would act as collateral for  the loan,\n\nwhich was to  be paid back to  ADL over a  seven-year period.\n\nThe borrowed funds would then be used to purchase 546,520 New\n\nShares of ADL common stock at $60 per share.  At closing, the\n\nstock would immediately be  deposited into a suspense account\n\nwithin the ESOP to be released over the  next seven years, on\n\na pro  rata basis,  to the  individual accounts  of qualified\n\nemployee participants  of the ESOP pursuant  to the following\n\narrangement.     Each  quarter,  ADL  agreed   to  make  cash\n\ncontributions  to the ESOP in an  amount sufficient to defray\n\nthe principal and interest payments due ADL on the ESOP loan.\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nThe  ESOP,  in  turn,   agreed  to  return  the  contribution\n\nimmediately  to ADL in repayment  of its note.   Meanwhile, a\n\nproportionate number of  the New Shares held  in the suspense\n\naccount as collateral would be freed and allocated by formula\n\nto the  individual accounts  of participating ADL  employees.\n\nIn effect, ADL was  agreeing to repay the loan it  was making\n\nto the ESOP to fund the purchase of the New  Shares, with the\n\nemployees ultimately reaping the benefits.    \n\n          On  November 30, 1988,  plaintiff was informed that\n\ndue  to budget  cuts, he  was to  be terminated.2   Plaintiff\n\nnegotiated an  extension of  salary and benefits  until March\n\n24, 1989,  with an \"unpaid  leave of absence\" to  follow.  On\n\nMay  12, 1989,  plaintiff filed  his original  complaint, pro\r                                                                         \n\nse.3   Plaintiff then  resigned from  ADL, effective  May 18,\r              \r                                \r                                \n\n2.  Plaintiff has  not claimed in his  amended complaint that\r            1989.    Approximately  one  year  later,  on  May  7,  1990,\nhe  was  terminated improperly  in  order to  deprive  him of\nstanding to initiate or maintain this action under  29 U.S.C.\r            plaintiff  elected to receive  his total  vested distribution\n  1140.\nfrom the  ESOP in the form  of 47 shares of  ADL common stock\n3.  Plaintiff originally named as defendants all  trustees of\nthe  Memorial  Drive Trust,  the  Memorial  Drive Trust,  the\r            and   a  check   in  the   amount  of  $51.49.4     Plaintiff\ntrustees of the  ESOP, the  ESOP and Arthur  D. Little,  Inc.\nThese   original  defendants   answered  the   complaint  and\nthereafter jointly filed  a motion for summary  judgment.  On\nJune 9, 1993, before  the court ruled on  defendants' motion,\nall parties agreed to a joint stipulation dismissing all non-\nADL ESOP trustee defendants from this action. \n\n4.  ESOP  participants  may  elect  to  receive  their vested\nbenefits in one of two ways.  They may either take the shares\nthen  existing in  their individual account  or ask  that the\nESOP cash  out their account.   In order  to cash out  a plan\nparticipant, the ESOP Trustees must  sell the stock then held\nin the participant's  individual account to  ADL, at a  price\nbased on the most recent appraised value of new shares.   The\nTrustees,  in turn,  pay the  participant the  resulting cash\nproceeds.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nsubsequently  retained an  attorney  and, on  June 10,  1993,\n\nfiled a motion to amend his original complaint, together with\n\nan amended complaint seeking \"recovery  on behalf of the ESOP\n\nfor breach of fiduciary duty for the Trustees' failure to act\n\nfor   the   exclusive   benefit  of   the   participants  and\n\nbeneficiaries of the ESOP plan.\"  Plaintiff also sought class\n\ncertification  at  this time.    The  district court  granted\n\nplaintiff's motion to amend on June 24, 1993.  The defendants\n\nthen renewed  their  motion for  summary judgment,  including\n\nfurther argument  directed at  the amended complaint.   After\n\naccepting additional memoranda  and hearing oral  argument on\n\ndefendants'  motion,  the   district  court  granted  summary\n\njudgment in  favor of defendants, citing  plaintiff's lack of\n\nstanding.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \n\n          As always,  we review  a district court's  grant of\n\nsummary judgment de novo and, like the district court, review\r                                    \n\nthe  facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n\nSee e.g., Woods v.

Our review is limited to  the record as\n\nit stood before the district court at the time of its ruling.\n\nVoutour v.

Second,  plaintiff contends that  the court\n\nerred in concluding  that he lacked  standing because he  had\n\nfailed to present a colorable claim for benefits.  We discuss\n\neach of these arguments below.\n\n          Plaintiff brought this action pursuant to 29 U.S.C.\n\n  1132(a)(2), which authorizes a \"participant,\" \"beneficiary\"\n\nor  \"fiduciary\" to  bring a  civil action  for breach  of any\n\nfiduciary duty proscribed  by 29 U.S.C.    1109(a).   Because\n\nplaintiff  is  neither a  beneficiary  nor  a fiduciary,  our\n\ncentral task is to determine whether plaintiff qualifies as a\n\nplan \"participant\" within the meaning of ERISA.  \n\n          ERISA defines the term \"participant\" to include\n\n          any  employee or  former  employee of  an\n          employer, or any member or  former member\n          of  an employee  organization, who  is or\r                                                               \n          may become eligible  to receive a benefit\r                                                               \n          of any type from an employee benefit plan\n          which covers employees  of such  employer\n          or members of such organization, or whose\n          beneficiaries may be eligible  to receive\n          any such benefit.\n\n29  U.S.C.   1002 (7) (emphasis supplied).  In Firestone Tire\r                                                                         \n\n&amp; Rubber  Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 117 (1989), the Supreme\r                                  \n\nCourt   interpreted  this  provision  as  providing  for  two\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\ndistinct categories of ERISA participants:  1) \"employees in,\n\nor  reasonably   expected   to  be   in,  currently   covered\n\nemployment;\" or  2) former  employees who have  \"a reasonable\n\nexpectation  of  returning to  covered  employment\" and/or  a\n\n\"colorable claim\" to  vested benefits.  Id.  at 117 (internal\r                                                       \n\nquotations omitted).  \n\n          Plaintiff  maintains that  he  has  standing  under\n\neither  prong.    First, he  argues  that  he  was a  current\n\nemployee when  he initiated this  action and should  remain a\n\ncurrent employee  throughout the litigation  for purposes  of\n\nstanding despite  his actual  termination of employment.   In\n\nthe alternative, he asserts that he is a former employee with\n\na  colorable claim to vested benefits.  We disagree with each\n\nof plaintiff's contentions.\n\n          With regard to plaintiff's argument  that he should\n\nbe considered  an employee under Firestone's  first prong, we\r                                                      \n\nnote  that the basis for  \"`[s]tanding, since it  goes to the\n\nvery power of  the court to act, must exist  at all stages of\r                                                                      \n\nthe proceeding, and not  merely when the action  is initiated\n\nor during  an  initial appeal.'\"    Sommers Drug  Stores  Co.\r                                                                         \n\nEmployee Profit Sharing  v. Corrigan, 883 F.2d  345, 348 (5th\r                                                \n\nCir. 1989)  (emphasis supplied)  (quoting Safir v.  Dole, 718\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 475,  481 (D.C.Cir. 1983),  cert. denied, 467  U.S. 1206\r                                                         \n\n(1984)).  Therefore, although plaintiff may have had standing\n\nas a current  employee when  he brought this  action, by  the\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ntime he filed his amended complaint, he lost this standing on\n\naccount  of having  terminated  his employment  with ADL  and\n\nhaving collected  all vested benefits  then due him  from the\n\nESOP.5   Accordingly, plaintiff  cannot be considered  a plan\n\nparticipant under Firestone's first prong.\r                                       \n\n          Plaintiff's  argument that  he  has standing  under\n\nFirestone's second prong fares no better.  Plaintiff does not\r                     \n\ncontend that he has a reasonable expectation  of returning to\n\ncovered  employment;  instead,  he   argues  that  he  has  a\n\ncolorable  claim to  benefits as  a former  employee because,\n\n\"but for\" defendants  breach of duty, he would  have received\n\nadditional, vested benefits at the  time he received his lump\n\nsum payment from the ESOP.  Plaintiff reaches this conclusion\n\nin stages.  First, he notes  that, under 29 U.S.C.   1109(a),\n\nfiduciaries who breach their  fiduciary duties must make good\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  In  his  brief,  plaintiff cites  Nishimoto  v. Federman-\r                                                                         \nBachrach &amp; Assoc., 903  F.2d 709 (9th Cir. 1990),  as support\r                             \nfor his position that  ERISA standing is frozen in time as of\nthe date of  the initial  filing of the  complaint.   Despite\nplaintiff's highly  suspect manipulation  of the  language of\nNishimoto,  the  case  contradicts,  rather   than  supports,\r                     \nplaintiff's argument.  The  issue in Nishimoto was  whether a\r                                                          \ncourt  could adjudicate  pendent state  claims  following the\ndisposition of the federal claim.   At the time she filed her\ncomplaint, Nishimoto  was a former employee  who was eligible\nto receive vested benefits.  She \"settled\" her ERISA claim by\naccepting a lump sum payment during the course of litigation.\nThe court noted that Nishimoto's \"receipt of all the benefits\nshe was  due under the  plan indicates .  . . that  the ERISA\nclaim might have become subject  to dismissal at that point.\"\nId. at 715.  Thus,  Nishimoto's status at the time of  filing\r               \nwas critical only as to whether the court was deprived of the\npower  to adjudicate the remaining pendent state claims.  See\r                                                                         \nid.  \r               \n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nto the plan any losses resulting from their breach.   In this\n\ncase, therefore, defendants would  have to reimburse the plan\n\nthe difference between the  amount of money paid for  the New\n\nShares of  ADL stock and the true  market value.  In deciding\n\nhow that money should be allocated once returned to the fund,\n\nplaintiff asks the court,  under the equitable powers granted\n\nby 29  U.S.C.    1109(a), to allocate  the funds  to him  and\n\nthose members of  the ESOP  who were \"cashed  out\" after  the\n\ndate of the transaction.   Relying upon Sommers, 883  F.2d at\r                                                           \n\n350, plaintiff  contends that his share  should be calculated\n\nby dividing the  number of  shares he received  when he  left\n\n(47) by  the total  number of  shares (546,520)  and multiply\n\nthat fraction (.00008) by the overpayment.   \n\n          In  Sommers, however,  plan participants  brought a\r                                 \n\nclass  action   suit  to   recover  money  lost   during  the\n\nliquidation of  a retirement trust.   Plaintiffs claimed that\n\ntheir lump sum payments were less than the amount due because\n\nthe  trustees had  sold the  trust stock  for less  than fair\n\nmarket value.  Each claimant had a set number of shares which\n\nwere  undervalued when it  came time to cash  them in.  Thus,\n\nthey were  not paid the  full extent of  their benefits.   We\n\nhave no such claim before us.  \n\n          Unlike  the  claimants  in  Sommers,  plaintiff has\r                                                         \n\nfailed to  show that defendants' alleged  breach of fiduciary\n\nduty  had a  direct and  inevitable effect  on  his benefits.\r                                                               \n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nDefendants borrowed funds from ADL to acquire a set number of\n\nADL New Shares, i.e., 546,520.  Had defendants not overvalued\n\nthe shares, they would  not have borrowed as much  money from\n\nADL.   Instead,  a recalculation  of the  price of  the stock\n\nwould have resulted  only in a smaller  loan, lower principal\n\nand  interest payments to be  paid quarterly by  ADL, and the\n\nsame number of New Shares placed in the suspense account.  It\n\nwould  not have resulted in a similar  loan being made to the\r                      \n\nESOP with any excess  cash to be distributed to  the accounts\n\nof the participants.   The borrowed funds were  not available\n\nfor distribution;  they were  to be used  exclusively to  buy\r                                                                 \n\nstock, or in the alternative, to pay back the loan.6\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.  We acknowledge that because the ESOP note would have been\nfor less money,  the formula by  which the encumbered  shares\nwere  to be  released  to qualified  participants might  have\r                                                                   \naltered the  rate of release of  stock one way or  the other.\r                                                  \nThe  district court was in no position to know this, however,\nsince plaintiff failed to argue this point and further failed\nto  provide it with  the ESOP agreement.   Accordingly, there\nwas no  basis for the court to infer standing from a putative\naccelerated  release  of   stock.  Additionally,  unlike  the\nsituation in Reich  v. Valley  Nat. Bank of  Arizona, 837  F.\r                                                                \nSupp.  1259(S.D.N.Y. 1993),  where  the funding  of the  ESOP\ndrove the company into bankruptcy, no adverse economic effect\nstemming from  the overvaluation  was alleged here,  and thus\nthat issue is not before us.\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \n\n          As we have explained, plaintiff failed to establish\n\nstanding  to sue under ERISA.7  The district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of defendant is therefore\n\n               Affirmed.

Whatever\nmerits  plaintiff's  argument   might  have,  we  note   that\nVartanian did  not involve  a situation,  as here,  where the\r                     \nplaintiffs  could  not  \"establish  that  they   were  former\nemployees  with a  colorable claim  to vested  benefits\" when\nfaced  with a motion for summary judgment.

Plaintiff now appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.  After careful consideration of plaintiff's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arthur D. Little, Inc.  (\"ADL\") is a Cambridge-based international consulting firm.  Plaintiff began working at ADL as a management consultant on June 7, 1981.  In March 1988, ADL's Board of Director's voted to form an ESOP<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, and to propose a \"going-private\" transaction whereby ADL would 1) acquire all outstanding publicly held shares of ADL stock;  2) cancel all existing shares of ADL stock;  3) reissue \"New Shares\";  and 4) sell a portion of the New Shares to the ESOP with financing from ADL (which in turn received bank financing).  Plaintiff objected to the transaction for a variety of reasons, and delivered to the Department of Labor a thirty-two page memorandum detailing his belief that, as part of the going-private transaction, the ESOP Trustees were intending to buy ADL common stock in excess of adequate consideration within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(18).  Plaintiff urged the Department of Labor to seek an injunction enjoining ADL from consummating its plan.  The Department of Labor declined plaintiff's invitation, and on June 14, 1988, the ADL disinterested shareholders approved the proposed transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the ESOP Trustees negotiated a $32.8 million loan from ADL.  The agreement provided that the to-be-purchased ADL stock would act as collateral for the loan, which was to be paid back to ADL over a seven-year period.  The borrowed funds would then be used to purchase 546,520 New Shares of ADL common stock at $60 per share.  At closing, the stock would immediately be deposited into a suspense account within the ESOP to be released over the next seven years, on a pro rata basis, to the individual accounts of qualified employee participants of the ESOP pursuant to the following arrangement.  Each quarter, ADL agreed to make cash contributions to the ESOP in an amount sufficient to defray the principal and interest payments due ADL on the ESOP loan.  The ESOP, in turn, agreed to return the contribution immediately to ADL in repayment of its note.  Meanwhile, a proportionate number of the New Shares held in the suspense account as collateral would be freed and allocated by formula to the individual accounts of participating ADL employees.  In effect, ADL was agreeing to repay the loan it was making to the ESOP to fund the purchase of the New Shares, with the employees ultimately reaping the benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 30, 1988, plaintiff was informed that due to budget cuts, he was to be terminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Plaintiff negotiated an extension of salary and benefits until March 24, 1989, with an \"unpaid leave of absence\" to follow.  On May 12, 1989, plaintiff filed his original complaint, pro se.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Plaintiff then resigned from ADL, effective May 18, 1989.  Approximately one year later, on May 7, 1990, plaintiff elected to receive his total vested distribution from the ESOP in the form of 47 shares of ADL common stock and a check in the amount of $51.49.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Plaintiff subsequently retained an attorney and, on June 10, 1993, filed a motion to amend his original complaint, together with an amended complaint seeking \"recovery on behalf of the ESOP for breach of fiduciary duty for the Trustees' failure to act for the exclusive benefit of the participants and beneficiaries of the ESOP plan.\"   Plaintiff also sought class certification at this time.  The district court granted plaintiff's motion to amend on June 24, 1993.  The defendants then renewed their motion for summary judgment, including further argument directed at the amended complaint.  After accepting additional memoranda and hearing oral argument on defendants' motion, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, citing plaintiff's lack of standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As always, we review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and, like the district court, review the facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.  See e.g., Woods v. Friction, 30 F.3d 255, 259 (1st Cir.1994).  Our review is limited to the record as it stood before the district court at the time of its ruling.  Voutour v. Vitale, 761 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1100, 106 S.Ct. 879, 88 L.Ed.2d 916 (1986).  Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  A material fact is one which has the \"potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law.\"  Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 703 (1st.  Cir.1993).  Thus, the nonmovant bears the burden of placing at least one material fact into dispute once the moving party offers evidence of the absence of a genuine issue.  Darr v. Muratore, 8 F.3d 854, 859 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) \"mandates the entry of summary judgment, ... upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\").  In other words, neither \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation,\" Medina-Munoz v. R.J.

First, plaintiff charges that the district court erred in ruling that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue his ERISA action because he was not a current employee throughout the litigation.  Second, plaintiff contends that the court erred in concluding that he lacked standing because he had failed to present a colorable claim for benefits.  We discuss each of these arguments below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff brought this action pursuant to 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(2), which authorizes a \"participant,\" \"beneficiary\" or \"fiduciary\" to bring a civil action for breach of any fiduciary duty proscribed by 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1109(a).  Because plaintiff is neither a beneficiary nor a fiduciary, our central task is to determine whether plaintiff qualifies as a plan \"participant\" within the meaning of ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA defines the term \"participant\" to include</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>any employee or former employee of an employer, or any member or former member of an employee organization, who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization, or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(7) (emphasis supplied).  In Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 117, 109 S.Ct. 948, 957-58, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989), the Supreme Court interpreted this provision as providing for two distinct categories of ERISA participants:  1) \"employees in, or reasonably expected to be in, currently covered employment;\"  or 2) former employees who have \"a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment\" and/or a \"colorable claim\" to vested benefits.  Id. at 117, 109 S.Ct. at 958 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff maintains that he has standing under either prong.  First, he argues that he was a current employee when he initiated this action and should remain a current employee throughout the litigation for purposes of standing despite his actual termination of employment.  In the alternative, he asserts that he is a former employee with a colorable claim to vested benefits.  We disagree with each of plaintiff's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to plaintiff's argument that he should be considered an employee under Firestone's first prong, we note that the basis for \" '[s]tanding, since it goes to the very power of the court to act, must exist at all stages of the proceeding, and not merely when the action is initiated or during an initial appeal.' \"   Sommers Drug Stores Co. Employee Profit Sharing v. Corrigan, 883 F.2d 345, 348 (5th Cir.1989) (emphasis supplied) (quoting Safir v. Dole, 718 F.2d 475, 481 (D.C.Cir.1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1206, 104 S.Ct. 2389, 81 L.Ed.2d 347 (1984)).  Therefore, although plaintiff may have had standing as a current employee when he brought this action, by the time he filed his amended complaint, he lost this standing on account of having terminated his employment with ADL and having collected all vested benefits then due him from the ESOP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Accordingly, plaintiff cannot be considered a plan participant under Firestone's first prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's argument that he has standing under Firestone's second prong fares no better.  Plaintiff does not contend that he has a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment;  instead, he argues that he has a colorable claim to benefits as a former employee because, \"but for\" defendants breach of duty, he would have received additional, vested benefits at the time he received his lump sum payment from the ESOP.  Plaintiff reaches this conclusion in stages.  First, he notes that, under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1109(a), fiduciaries who breach their fiduciary duties must make good to the plan any losses resulting from their breach.  In this case, therefore, defendants would have to reimburse the plan the difference between the amount of money paid for the New Shares of ADL stock and the true market value.  In deciding how that money should be allocated once returned to the fund, plaintiff asks the court, under the equitable powers granted by 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1109(a), to allocate the funds to him and those members of the ESOP who were \"cashed out\" after the date of the transaction.  Relying upon Sommers, 883 F.2d at 350, plaintiff contends that his share should be calculated by dividing the number of shares he received when he left (47) by the total number of shares (546,520) and multiply that fraction (.00008) by the overpayment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sommers, however, plan participants brought a class action suit to recover money lost during the liquidation of a retirement trust.  Plaintiffs claimed that their lump sum payments were less than the amount due because the trustees had sold the trust stock for less than fair market value.  Each claimant had a set number of shares which were undervalued when it came time to cash them in.  Thus, they were not paid the full extent of their benefits.  We have no such claim before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the claimants in Sommers, plaintiff has failed to show that defendants' alleged breach of fiduciary duty had a direct and inevitable effect on his benefits.  Defendants borrowed funds from ADL to acquire a set number of ADL New Shares, i.e., 546,520.  Had defendants not overvalued the shares, they would not have borrowed as much money from ADL.  Instead, a recalculation of the price of the stock would have resulted only in a smaller loan, lower principal and interest payments to be paid quarterly by ADL, and the same number of New Shares placed in the suspense account.  It would not have resulted in a similar loan being made to the ESOP with any excess cash to be distributed to the accounts of the participants.  The borrowed funds were not available for distribution;  they were to be used exclusively to buy stock, or in the alternative, to pay back the loan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have explained, plaintiff failed to establish standing to sue under ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant is therefore</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Despite plaintiff's highly suspect manipulation of the language of Nishimoto, the case contradicts, rather than supports, plaintiff's argument.  The issue in Nishimoto was whether a court could adjudicate pendent state claims following the disposition of the federal claim.  At the time she filed her complaint, Nishimoto was a former employee who was eligible to receive vested benefits.  She \"settled\" her ERISA claim by accepting a lump sum payment during the course of litigation.  The court noted that Nishimoto's \"receipt of all the benefits she was due under the plan indicates ... that the ERISA claim might have become subject to dismissal at that point.\"  Id. at 715.   Thus, Nishimoto's status at the time of filing was critical only as to whether the court was deprived of the power to adjudicate the remaining pendent state claims.

The district court was in no position to know this, however, since plaintiff failed to argue this point and further failed to provide it with the ESOP agreement.  Accordingly, there was no basis for the court to infer standing from a putative accelerated release of stock.  Additionally, unlike the situation in Reich v. Valley Nat. Bank of Arizona, 837 F.Supp. 1259 (S.D.N.Y.1993), where the funding of the ESOP drove the company into bankruptcy, no adverse economic effect stemming from the overvaluation was alleged here, and thus that issue is not before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff makes a final argument that our recent decision in Vartanian v.

Whatever merits plaintiff's argument might have, we note that Vartanian did not involve a situation, as here, where the plaintiffs could not \"establish that they were former employees with a colorable claim to vested benefits\" when faced with a motion for summary judgment.  See id. at 702-03 n. 4.   Accordingly, Vartanian is inapposite</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Plaintiff now appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.  After careful consideration of plaintiff's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arthur D. Little, Inc.  (\"ADL\") is a Cambridge-based international consulting firm.  Plaintiff began working at ADL as a management consultant on June 7, 1981.  In March 1988, ADL's Board of Director's voted to form an ESOP<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, and to propose a \"going-private\" transaction whereby ADL would 1) acquire all outstanding publicly held shares of ADL stock;  2) cancel all existing shares of ADL stock;  3) reissue \"New Shares\";  and 4) sell a portion of the New Shares to the ESOP with financing from ADL (which in turn received bank financing).  Plaintiff objected to the transaction for a variety of reasons, and delivered to the Department of Labor a thirty-two page memorandum detailing his belief that, as part of the going-private transaction, the ESOP Trustees were intending to buy ADL common stock in excess of adequate consideration within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(18).  Plaintiff urged the Department of Labor to seek an injunction enjoining ADL from consummating its plan.  The Department of Labor declined plaintiff's invitation, and on June 14, 1988, the ADL disinterested shareholders approved the proposed transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the ESOP Trustees negotiated a $32.8 million loan from ADL.  The agreement provided that the to-be-purchased ADL stock would act as collateral for the loan, which was to be paid back to ADL over a seven-year period.  The borrowed funds would then be used to purchase 546,520 New Shares of ADL common stock at $60 per share.  At closing, the stock would immediately be deposited into a suspense account within the ESOP to be released over the next seven years, on a pro rata basis, to the individual accounts of qualified employee participants of the ESOP pursuant to the following arrangement.  Each quarter, ADL agreed to make cash contributions to the ESOP in an amount sufficient to defray the principal and interest payments due ADL on the ESOP loan.  The ESOP, in turn, agreed to return the contribution immediately to ADL in repayment of its note.  Meanwhile, a proportionate number of the New Shares held in the suspense account as collateral would be freed and allocated by formula to the individual accounts of participating ADL employees.  In effect, ADL was agreeing to repay the loan it was making to the ESOP to fund the purchase of the New Shares, with the employees ultimately reaping the benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 30, 1988, plaintiff was informed that due to budget cuts, he was to be terminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Plaintiff negotiated an extension of salary and benefits until March 24, 1989, with an \"unpaid leave of absence\" to follow.  On May 12, 1989, plaintiff filed his original complaint, pro se.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Plaintiff then resigned from ADL, effective May 18, 1989.  Approximately one year later, on May 7, 1990, plaintiff elected to receive his total vested distribution from the ESOP in the form of 47 shares of ADL common stock and a check in the amount of $51.49.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Plaintiff subsequently retained an attorney and, on June 10, 1993, filed a motion to amend his original complaint, together with an amended complaint seeking \"recovery on behalf of the ESOP for breach of fiduciary duty for the Trustees' failure to act for the exclusive benefit of the participants and beneficiaries of the ESOP plan.\"   Plaintiff also sought class certification at this time.  The district court granted plaintiff's motion to amend on June 24, 1993.  The defendants then renewed their motion for summary judgment, including further argument directed at the amended complaint.  After accepting additional memoranda and hearing oral argument on defendants' motion, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, citing plaintiff's lack of standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As always, we review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and, like the district court, review the facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.  See e.g., Woods v.

Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

Therefore, although plaintiff may have had standing as a current employee when he brought this action, by the time he filed his amended complaint, he lost this standing on account of having terminated his employment with ADL and having collected all vested benefits then due him from the ESOP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Accordingly, plaintiff cannot be considered a plan participant under Firestone's first prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's argument that he has standing under Firestone's second prong fares no better.  Plaintiff does not contend that he has a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment;  instead, he argues that he has a colorable claim to benefits as a former employee because, \"but for\" defendants breach of duty, he would have received additional, vested benefits at the time he received his lump sum payment from the ESOP.  Plaintiff reaches this conclusion in stages.  First, he notes that, under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1109(a), fiduciaries who breach their fiduciary duties must make good to the plan any losses resulting from their breach.  In this case, therefore, defendants would have to reimburse the plan the difference between the amount of money paid for the New Shares of ADL stock and the true market value.  In deciding how that money should be allocated once returned to the fund, plaintiff asks the court, under the equitable powers granted by 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1109(a), to allocate the funds to him and those members of the ESOP who were \"cashed out\" after the date of the transaction.  Relying upon <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528221\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sommers,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/528221/the-sommers-drug-stores-company-employee-profit-sharing-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, plaintiff contends that his share should be calculated by dividing the number of shares he received when he left (47) by the total number of shares (546,520) and multiply that fraction (.00008) by the overpayment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sommers, however, plan participants brought a class action suit to recover money lost during the liquidation of a retirement trust.  Plaintiffs claimed that their lump sum payments were less than the amount due because the trustees had sold the trust stock for less than fair market value.  Each claimant had a set number of shares which were undervalued when it came time to cash them in.  Thus, they were not paid the full extent of their benefits.  We have no such claim before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the claimants in Sommers, plaintiff has failed to show that defendants' alleged breach of fiduciary duty had a direct and inevitable effect on his benefits.  Defendants borrowed funds from ADL to acquire a set number of ADL New Shares, i.e., 546,520.  Had defendants not overvalued the shares, they would not have borrowed as much money from ADL.  Instead, a recalculation of the price of the stock would have resulted only in a smaller loan, lower principal and interest payments to be paid quarterly by ADL, and the same number of New Shares placed in the suspense account.  It would not have resulted in a similar loan being made to the ESOP with any excess cash to be distributed to the accounts of the participants.  The borrowed funds were not available for distribution;  they were to be used exclusively to buy stock, or in the alternative, to pay back the loan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have explained, plaintiff failed to establish standing to sue under ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant is therefore</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

The Trustees, in turn, pay the participant the resulting cash proceeds</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In his brief, plaintiff cites Nishimoto v.

Despite plaintiff's highly suspect manipulation of the language of Nishimoto, the case contradicts, rather than supports, plaintiff's argument.  The issue in Nishimoto was whether a court could adjudicate pendent state claims following the disposition of the federal claim.  At the time she filed her complaint, Nishimoto was a former employee who was eligible to receive vested benefits.  She \"settled\" her ERISA claim by accepting a lump sum payment during the course of litigation.  The court noted that Nishimoto's \"receipt of all the benefits she was due under the plan indicates ... that the ERISA claim might have become subject to dismissal at that point.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541811\"><a href=\"/opinion/541811/52-fair-emplpraccas-1729-53-empl-prac-dec-p-39952-12-employee/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 715. </a></span>  Thus, Nishimoto's status at the time of filing was critical only as to whether the court was deprived of the power to adjudicate the remaining pendent state claims.

The district court was in no position to know this, however, since plaintiff failed to argue this point and further failed to provide it with the ESOP agreement.  Accordingly, there was no basis for the court to infer standing from a putative accelerated release of stock.  Additionally, unlike the situation in Reich v. Valley Nat. Bank of Arizona, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span> </span>(S.D.N.Y.1993), where the funding of the ESOP drove the company into bankruptcy, no adverse economic effect stemming from the overvaluation was alleged here, and thus that issue is not before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff makes a final argument that our recent decision in Vartanian v.
