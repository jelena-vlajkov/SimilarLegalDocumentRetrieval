Appellant  Baruwa was convicted  by a\r                                \r\n\nRhode Island federal jury  of eight counts of mail  fraud, in\r\n\nviolation  of 18 U.S.C.   1341.  He challenges his conviction\r\n\non two of the  counts, arguing that the mailings  relied upon\r\n\nby the Government in  support did not meet the  statute's \"in\r\n\nfurtherance of  the scheme\"  requirement, and  therefore were\r\n\ninsufficient to support  his conviction.  We disagree, and so\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n          The evidence  at trial, unchallenged in  any way on\r\n\nappeal,  revealed  that  Baruwa  filed  eight  false personal\r\n\ninjury   claims  against  various   insurance  companies  and\r\n\nbusinesses,  based on a claimed slip  and fall at each of the\r\n\ninsured premises.   For  all  the claims,  the United  States\r\n\nmails  were  used  to   carry  claims-related  materials  and\r\n\ncorrespondence to or from Baruwa.  \r\n\n          The heart  of Baruwa's  argument on appeal  is that\r\n\nthe  two letters  which form  the basis  of Counts  Seven and\r\n\nEight1 of  the indictment were  not mailed in  furtherance of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  letter in  support of  Count Seven  was from  Roy A.\r\nProut,  Investigator for Constitution  State Service Company,\r\nthe claims handler for Woolworth, Inc.  The letter stated, in\r\nessence, that  an investigation was ongoing  to determine the\r\ncircumstances of the accident, and the extent and severity of\r\ninjury.    It advised  Mr.  Baruwa that  his  cooperation was\r\nnecessary,  and that  he  would need  to  provide a  recorded\r\nstatement and documentation of injuries.\r\n     The letter in support of Count Eight was from Michael J.\r\nStack, Special Investigator for  Liberty Mutual.  This letter\r\nidentified  Mr.  Stack  as  the  claim's  investigator,   and\r\nrequested Mr. Baruwa to contact him to discuss the claim.   \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthe scheme to  defraud, as  required by  statute, but  rather\r\n\nwere sent to him  by investigators who regarded his  claim as\r\n\nquestionable.    Each  investigator  testified,  as  to   his\r\n\nrespective  letter,  that it  is sent  only  when a  claim is\r\n\nsuspicious.  These letters,  so  the argument  runs, did  not\r\n\nfurther Baruwa's scheme because they were not sent as part of\r\n\nthe  routine  processing of  his  claim, but  were  sent only\r\n\nbecause his claims were suspect. \r\n\n          There are  two elements to the crime of mail fraud.\r\n\n\"They  are  the  defendant's  participation in  a  scheme  to\r\n\ndefraud and  the use of the mails, either by or caused by the\r\n\n[defendant], in furtherance of the  scheme.\"  U.S. v. Yefsky,\r                                                                        \r\n\n994 F.2d 885, 891 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          For a  mailing to be considered  `in furtherance of\r\n\nthe scheme,'  \"the scheme's  completion or the  prevention of\r\n\nits  detection  must   have  depended  in  some  way  on  the\r\n\nmailings.\"   U.S. v.  Pacheco-Ortiz, 889  F.2d 301,  305 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1989), quoting U.S.  v. Silvano, 812 F.2d 754,  760 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1987)(internal quotation marks omitted.)  The use of the\r\n\nmails need not be  an essential element of the  scheme; \"[i]t\r\n\nis sufficient for the mailing to be `incident to an essential\r\n\npart  of  the  scheme,' ...  or  `a  step  in the  plot....'\"\r\n\nSchmuck  v.  U.S.,  489  U.S. 705,  710-11  (1989)  (citation\r                             \r\n\nomitted.)  \r\n\n          The  relevant  question at  all  times is\r\n          whether  the  mailing   is  part  of  the\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          execution of the  scheme as conceived  by\r\n          the perpetrator at  the time,  regardless\r\n          of  whether  the  mailing later,  through\r\n          hindsight,   may   prove  to   have  been\r\n          counterproductive and return to haunt the\r\n          perpetrator of the fraud.  The mail fraud\r\n          statute  includes  no guarantee  that the\r\n          use  of  the  mails  will be  risk  free.\r\n          Those  who  use  the  mails   to  defraud\r\n          succeed at their peril.  \r\n\nId.  at 715.   Schmuck  involved  a scheme  whereby defendant\r                                  \r\n\nrolled  back  car odometers  and  resold  the resulting  low-\r\n\nmileage  cars to  retail dealers for  ultimate resale  to the\r\n\npublic.  The dealers submitted title application forms to the\r\n\nstate  on behalf of their  customers.  The  Court agreed that\r\n\nthese submissions  satisfied the mailing element  of the mail\r\n\nfraud  offense,  observing  that  \"once the  full  flavor  of\r\n\nSchmuck's scheme is appreciated,\" it became clear that \"[t]he\r\n\nmailing of the title-registration forms was an essential step\r\n\nin the successful passage of title to the retail purchasers.\"\r\n\nId. at 712, 714.              In U.S. v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924\r                                                           \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1987),  we upheld  defendant's conviction  on five\r\n\ncounts  of mail fraud and  rejected the argument that certain\r\n\nmailings  between an  attorney and  the insurance  company he\r\n\nrepresented were not in furtherance of the scheme \"but rather\r\n\nhindered it, because  they contained the  Insurance Company's\r\n\nattorney's  reservations about  the validity  of  the claim.\"\r\n\nId.  at 928.   We noted  first that  we have  given a liberal\r               \r\n\nconstruction  to the language of the mail fraud statute.  Id.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nIn  answer   to  Serino's   specific  argument,  we   said:  \r\n\n          Our response  is that the focus  ought to\r\n          be  concerned  less   with  the   precise\r\n          contents of the particular  mailings than\r\n          with  the role  those mailings  played in\r\n          the execution  of the scheme  to defraud.\r\n          As long as the mailings  are sufficiently\r\n          related  to  the   scheme  so  that   the\r\n          execution of the scheme depended on those\r\n          mailings being sent, the proper  nexus is\r\n          established.\r\n\nId. at 928-29.\r              \r\n\n          More recently, we upheld a mail fraud conviction in\r\n\nan insurance  context against the argument  that an insurer's\r\n\nletter,  acknowledging receipt of a claim for the theft of an\r\n\nautomobile,  was not part of the  scheme to defraud.  We said\r\n\nthat while the acknowledgement  letter itself did not involve\r\n\nany deception,  it \"was `incidental' to  an essential element\r\n\nin the scheme, namely, the criss-cross of mailings that would\r\n\nreasonably  be expected  when false  claims are  submitted to\r\n\ninsurance companies, are processed, and are ultimately  paid,\r\n\nthereby  making the  fraud successful.\"   U.S. v.  Morrow, 39\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  1228, 1237 (1st Cir.  1994), cert. den.,  115 S.Ct 1421\r                                                        \r\n\n(1995);  see also U.S.  v. Contenti, 735  F.2d 628,  631 n. 2\r                                               \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1984) (mailing is incident to an essential part of\r\n\na  scheme where it is `\"a normal concomitant of a transaction\r\n\nthat is essential to the fraudulent scheme,'\" quoting U.S. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nLea, 618 F.2d 426, 431 (7th Cir. 1980)).\r               \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          Our cases, therefore,  reflect that even a  mailing\r\n\nwhich  expresses some doubt about the validity of a claim can\r\n\nsatisfy the mail fraud statute if the mailing is sufficiently\r\n\nrelated to the scheme:  if execution of the scheme depends on\r\n\nthe mailing being sent. Other Circuits have so held.  \r\n\n          In  U.S. v. Draiman, 784 F.2d  248 (7th Cir. 1986),\r                                         \r\n\ndefendant  challenged  the Government's  reliance  on letters\r\n\nfrom  the  insurance  company's  attorney   to  his  business\r\n\nattorney indicating  that the  proofs of loss  and supporting\r\n\ndocumentation   were   not    sufficient,   and    requesting\r\n\nclarification.     \"Draiman   argues  that   these   mailings\r\n\nconflicted with his scheme  rather than furthered it.   If in\r\n\nfact the letters did conflict rather than promote the scheme,\r\n\nthey would not  qualify. ... The distinction  is that Draiman\r\n\nwas continuing  to try to  collect, and these  letters helped\r\n\ngive him another chance.\"  Id. at 253.  U.S.  v.  McClelland,\r                                                                        \r\n\n868 F.2d 704 (5th Cir. 1989) is instructive, too.  There, the\r\n\nindictment  was based in part  on a report  from an insurance\r\n\nadjuster  to the  insurance company's  claim department.   In\r\n\naddition to routine claims  information, the report reflected\r\n\nfacts that would lead the claims department to suspect arson,\r\n\nand to focus suspicion  on the defendant.  The  Fifth Circuit\r\n\nupheld reliance on the report, finding that it:\r\n\n          was not for the sole purpose of defeating\r\n          [defendant's]  claim.  Most  of the facts\r\n          contained in [the]  report are  routinely\r\n          used by  insurers in making  decisions on\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          whether  and  how  much  to   pay  on  an\r\n          insurance  claim.   Consequently,  [this]\r\n          interim  report was  a customary  step in\r\n          processing  an insurance claim.  The jury\r\n          was  entitled  to   conclude  that   this\r\n          mailing furthered [defendant's] scheme to\r\n          collect   on  his   fraudulent  insurance\r\n          claim.\r\n\nId. at 708-09.   \r               \r\n\n          Baruwa's scheme was to claim he had suffered injury\r\n\nat different insured premises.  Appellant's Brief, p. 2.  His\r\n\nobjective was to  collect proceeds from  the insurers of  the\r\n\npremises.  Id.  His claims set in motion a predictable flurry\r                         \r\n\nof paper,  a \"criss-cross of  mailings.\"   That the  mailings\r\n\nwere sent as  a result of the  suspicions of the insurers  is\r\n\nnot decisive here; it is obvious that mailings such as these,\r\n\nseeking information about Baruwa's claims and injuries,  were\r\n\nclearly  incidental, even  critical,  to the  success of  his\r\n\nscheme.    \"Success of  his plan,  were  it to  result, would\r\n\ndepend on  the sending and  receipt of precisely  those claim\r\n\ndocuments  and supporting  documentation  that  were in  fact\r\n\nsent....\"  Serino, 835 F.2d at 929.  Accordingly, we conclude\r                             \r\n\nthat the letters  relied on  in support of  Counts Seven  and\r\n\nEight  of  the  indictment  were sufficient  to  satisfy  the\r\n\nstatute.  Baruwa's conviction is affirmed.\r                                                     \r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n",

Sec. 1341.  He challenges his conviction on two of the counts, arguing that the mailings relied upon by the Government in support did not meet the statute's \"in furtherance of the scheme\" requirement, and therefore were insufficient to support his conviction.  We disagree, and so affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence at trial, unchallenged in any way on appeal, revealed that Baruwa filed eight false personal injury claims against various insurance companies and businesses, based on a claimed slip and fall at each of the insured premises.  For all the claims, the United States mails were used to carry claims-related materials and correspondence to or from Baruwa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The heart of Baruwa's argument on appeal is that the two letters which form the basis of Counts Seven and Eight<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> of the indictment were not mailed in furtherance of the scheme to defraud, as required by statute, but rather were sent to him by investigators who regarded his claim as questionable.  Each investigator testified, as to his respective letter, that it is sent only when a claim is suspicious.  These letters, so the argument runs, did not further Baruwa's scheme because they were not sent as part of the routine processing of his claim, but were sent only because his claims were suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two elements to the crime of mail fraud.  \"They are the defendant's participation in a scheme to defraud and the use of the mails, either by or caused by the [defendant], in furtherance of the scheme.\"  U.S. v.
