Plaintiff-appellant William C.  Duffy\r                                \n\nat one time  was employed  as an engineer  by defendant  AT&amp;T\n\nNetwork Systems,  Inc. (\"AT&amp;T\").   Almost six years  after he\n\nwas allegedly pressured by AT&amp;T personnel to resign from  his\n\nemployment, he brought this  pro se diversity action alleging\r                                               \n\nvarious tort and contract  claims arising from his employment\n\nand resignation.   At  the close  of discovery, the  district\n\ncourt  granted  AT&amp;T's motion  for  summary  judgment on  all\n\nclaims.  \n\n          On appeal  Duffy challenges the  judgment only with\n\nrespect  to the  claims  in  counts  one  and  three  of  the\n\ncomplaint. Applying a plenary standard  of review, as we must\n\non  appeal from  a summary judgment,  we perceive  no genuine\n\nissue  as to any material  fact, and agree  with the district\n\ncourt that  AT&amp;T is entitled to judgment  as a matter of law.\n\nSee Griggs-Ryan v. Smith,  904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st  Cir. 1990)\r                                    \n\n(standard of review); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\r                                          \n\n          In count one, Duffy  pleaded a claim for breach  of\n\nan employment contract based on AT&amp;T's personnel manuals.  He\n\nconceded in  his deposition, however, that  AT&amp;T had retained\n\nthe unilateral right to  modify each of the manuals  given to\n\nhim during the  course of his  employment, did not  negotiate\n\nwith him concerning the terms of the manuals, did not ask for\n\nhis assent to the terms, and that the manuals did not specify\n\nany term of  employment.   We agree with  the district  court\r\r\n\nthat these concessions fatally undermine  Duffy's theory that\n\nthe manuals  embodied  an enforceable  contract  between  the\n\nparties.  See Pearson v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 979\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  254, 256 (1st Cir. 1992), (citing Jackson v. Action for\r                                                                         \n\nBoston Community  Dev., Inc.,  525 N.E.2d 411  (Mass. 1988)).\r                                        \n\nAlthough Duffy argues that his contract claim was not limited\n\nto  the  personnel  manuals,   because  he  had  pleaded  \"an\n\nemployment contract . . .  which included . . . the  terms of\n\nthe AT&amp;T  personnel manual,\" he offered the district court no\n\nfacts from which a reasonable trier  might infer the elements\n\nessential to formation of a contract under any theory.\n\n          As did the district  court, we decline to entertain\n\nDuffy's  argument  that  count  one should  be  construed  to\n\ninclude  a claim for breach of an alleged contract to provide\n\nunemployment  benefits.   This argument  was offered  for the\r              \n\nfirst time  at the  summary judgment  hearing.  The  district\n\ncourt  did not  abuse its  discretion in  rejecting it  as an\n\nuntimely attempt to amend the pleadings.  Arguments not fully\n\ndeveloped in the  lower court  are deemed  waived on  appeal.\n\nRyan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                  \n\n          Lastly, we see  no error in the  dismissal of count\n\nthree  of the  complaint, which attempted  to assert  a civil\n\nclaim for violation of the state's personnel records statute,\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 149,   52C.  The statute does not expressly\n\nprovide a civil  remedy for the specific violation alleged --\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ndenial of access to personnel records -- and Duffy offered no\n\nreasoned support below for judicial creation of the suggested\n\nremedy.  He  now attempts  to expand count  three to  include\n\nother  alleged wrongdoing  of  an uncertain  nature which  he\n\nconstrues as coming within the statute's express civil remedy\n\nprovision.   Again, however, as  this argument was  not fully\n\ndeveloped below, it is deemed waived on appeal.
