On  October 19,\n                                          \n\n1990,  the  defendant-appellee,   Great  American   Insurance\n\nCompany (\"Great American\"), terminated its employment of  the\n\nplaintiff-appellant, Theodore L. LeBlanc, who was then fifty-\n\nnine  years old.  LeBlanc brought this action in the district\n\ncourt  against  his  former  employer  pursuant  to  the  Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act  (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C.    621-\n\n634  (1985 &amp; Supp.  1993), and Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  151B,   4.\n\nThe   district  court  entered   summary  judgment  in  Great\n\nAmerican's favor, and this appeal followed.  We affirm. \n\n                              I.\n\n                         JURISDICTION\n\n          Great American contends that  this court is without\n\njurisdiction over LeBlanc's appeal  from the district court's\n\norder granting summary judgment in its favor.  To follow this\n\nargument,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  the  procedural\n\nhistory of this case.\n\n          The  district  court  rendered its  final  judgment\n\ngranting summary  judgment to  Great American on  November 2,\n\n1992.   On  November  10, LeBlanc  moved for  reconsideration\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  On December 2, 1992, while this\n\nmotion for reconsideration was still pending, LeBlanc filed a\n\nnotice  of appeal from the November 2, 1992, grant of summary\n\njudgment.   Because at the  time LeBlanc filed  his notice of\n\nappeal  the district  court had  not yet  ruled  on LeBlanc's\n\n                             -4-\n\nmotion  for  reconsideration,  we  determined  that  we  were\n\nwithout  jurisdiction to consider  the appeal and accordingly\n\ndismissed  it.   On  December 21,  1992,  the district  court\n\ndenied LeBlanc's motion for reconsideration.  LeBlanc filed a\n\nsecond notice of appeal on December 28.  The second notice of\n\nappeal asked for relief \"from the Order entered  December 21,\n\n1992, denying  Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration  of the\n\ncourt's  previously  entered  order  of   November  2,  1992,\n\ngranting  summary  judgment  in  favor  of   defendant  Great\n\nAmerican Insurance Companies [sic].\"\n\n          Great American argues that LeBlanc's  second notice\n\nof appeal,  because it  only challenges the  district court's\n\ndenial on  December 21, 1992 of LeBlanc's  Rule 59(e) motion,\n\ndoes not confer jurisdiction upon  this court to entertain an\n\nappeal  from the  district  court's judgment  of November  2,\n\n1992, granting summary judgment.  Appellee insists we possess\n\njurisdiction only  to consider the  narrower factors relevant\n\nto  the  district  court's  denial of  LeBlanc's  motion  for\n\nreconsideration.  We disagree.\n\n          It  is true that Fed.  R. App. P.  3(c) states that\n\n\"[t]he notice of appeal shall specify the . . . order or part\n\nthereof   appealed   from.\"     Rule  3(c)'s   \"commands  are\n\njurisdictional  and mandatory.\"   Kotler v.  American Tobacco\n                                                             \n\nCo.,  981  F.2d 7,  10-11 (1st  Cir.  1992) (citing  Smith v.\n                                                          \n\nBarry,     U.S.    , 112 S.  Ct. 678, 682, 116 L. Ed. 2d  678\n     \n\n                             -5-\n\n(1992); Torres v. Oakland  Scavenger Co., 487 U.S.  312, 315-\n                                        \n\n16, 108  S. Ct.  2405, 2407-08,  101 L. Ed.  2d 285  (1988)).\n\nNevertheless, courts  have been admonished  to interpret Rule\n\n3(c) liberally.  Id.; see Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S.  178, 181-\n                                        \n\n82, 83 S. Ct. 227, 228-30, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962).  \n\n          In general,  \"an appeal from  the denial of  a Rule\n\n59(e) motion is  not an appeal from the underlying judgment.\"\n\nMariani-Giron v. Acevedo-Ruiz, 945 F.2d 1, 3  (1st Cir. 1991)\n                             \n\n(citing  Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase  Manhattan Bank Corp., 871\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1,  2-3 (1st  Cir. 1989);  Pagan v.

This circuit has allowed a timely appeal\n\nfrom  the denial  of a timely  Rule 59(e) motion  to serve as\n\nnotice of  an appeal  from the  underlying judgment  in cases\n\nwhere  the appellant's intent to appeal  from the judgment is\n\nclear.   Id.; see Foman, 371 U.S.  at 181-82.  In making this\n                       \n\nassessment, we consider the notice of appeal  \"in the context\n\nof the record as a whole.\"  Kotler, 981 F.2d at 11.\n                                  \n\n          Foman v. Davis involved facts very similar to those\n                        \n\nin this case.  The district court had dismissed the complaint\n\nfor  failure  to state  a claim  upon  which relief  could be\n\ngranted.    The  next  day,  plaintiff  moved  to  vacate the\n\njudgment, pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 59(e), and  also moved\n\nto  amend  the  complaint.    While  the  motions were  still\n\npending, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the district\n\n                             -6-\n\ncourt's dismissal of the  complaint.  Shortly thereafter, the\n\ndistrict court denied the plaintiff's motions.  The plaintiff\n\nthen filed a  second notice of appeal from the  denial of the\n\nmotions.\n\n          Although the  parties in  Foman briefed and  argued\n                                         \n\nthe merits of the district court's dismissal of the complaint\n\nas well  as the  district court's  denial of the  plaintiff's\n\nmotions, the court of appeals,  of its own accord,  dismissed\n\nthe  appeal insofar as it was taken from the district court's\n\ndismissal of the complaint.   The court of appeals  held that\n\nthe  second notice of appeal was \"ineffective to review the .\n\n.  . judgment  dismissing  the complaint  because the  notice\n\nfailed to specify that  the appeal was being taken  from that\n\njudgment as  well as  from the  orders denying  the motions.\"\n\nFoman, 371 U.S. at 180-81.\n     \n\n          In reversing  the  court of  appeals,  the  Supreme\n\nCourt  held that \"[t]he defect in the second notice of appeal\n\ndid  not mislead or prejudice  the respondent.\"   Id. at 181.\n                                                     \n\nAlthough the Court agreed that the  first premature notice of\n\nappeal had had no  effect,1 it ruled that, \"[t]aking  the two\n\nnotices   and  the   appeal  papers   together,  petitioner's\n\nintention to seek review of both the dismissal and the denial\n\n                    \n\n1.  Similarly, the  first notice of  appeal in this  case was\nwithout effect.   See Fed. R.  App. P. 4(a)(4)(iii)  (stating\n                     \nthat a notice  of appeal  filed before the  disposition of  a\nmotion under Rule  59 to  alter or amend  the judgment  shall\nhave no effect).\n\n                             -7-\n\nof  the motions was manifest.\"   Id.  The Court found support\n                                    \n\nfor this  conclusion  from the  fact  that both  parties  had\n\nbriefed and argued the merits of the dismissal on appeal.\n\n          The  Court's decision  in Foman seems  to us  to be\n                                         \n\ndispositive  here.    LeBlanc's  intent to  appeal  from  the\n\ndistrict court's November 2,  1992, grant of summary judgment\n\nwas plain.  The two notices taken together revealed LeBlanc's\n\ndesire to appeal not just from the motion for reconsideration\n\nbut also from the underlying judgment.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n          Great American  is an  all lines insurance  company\n\nwith  its headquarters  in Cincinnati, Ohio.   As  of October\n\n1990, when  Great American dismissed LeBlanc,  Great American\n\nwas divided into four geographical regions: Northeast, South,\n\nMidwest,  and  West.    In  addition  to  these  geographical\n\ndivisions,  Great American  was  organized according  to  the\n\nlines  of  business,   distinguishing  between  personal  and\n\ncommercial lines of insurance.  At the time of his discharge,\n\nLeBlanc was  employed by Great American  Northeast, Inc. (the\n\n\"Northeast Zone\") in its commercial lines division.\n\n          Great American  hired LeBlanc in October  1980 as a\n\nbranch manager  in its  Wheaton, Maryland,  office.   At that\n\ntime, LeBlanc  was forty-nine years  old.  From  1980 through\n\n1988,  LeBlanc worked  for Great  American in  Maryland.   In\n\n                             -8-\n\nJanuary  1989,  Great American  transferred  the fifty-seven-\n\nyear-old LeBlanc, with his consent, to  eastern Massachusetts\n\nto   serve   as   a   commercial   lines   Agency  Operations\n\nRepresentative  (\"AOR\").   The  transfer was  approved by  Al\n\nConte, then-acting president of  the Northeast Zone, who also\n\nagreed to pay for LeBlanc's moving expenses and to give him a\n\nsixteen percent pay raise.\n\n          In his capacity as an AOR, LeBlanc  was expected to\n\nmarket  Great American  commercial  insurance to  independent\n\nagents or  brokers in eastern Massachusetts  and assist those\n\nagents and brokers who  were already selling Great American's\n\ninsurance  products.    When   LeBlanc  started  in   eastern\n\nMassachusetts,  he joined  Charles DeMartino,  then fifty-six\n\nyears  old,  as one  of  two  AORs marketing  Great  American\n\ncommercial lines insurance in eastern Massachusetts.  LeBlanc\n\nand DeMartino worked together in eastern  Massachusetts until\n\nLeBlanc's discharge.\n\n          According  to Great  American's evidence,  which is\n\nnot  contradicted, the  decision to  dismiss LeBlanc  had its\n\ngenesis  in August 1990, when Conte began to prepare a budget\n\nfor  the upcoming year for  the Northeast Zone.   Because the\n\nNortheast  Zone  was experiencing  financial problems  at the\n\ntime,   Thomas  Hayes,  Executive   Vice-President  of  Great\n\nAmerican,  instructed  Conte to  submit  a  leaner budget  to\n\ncorporate headquarters.  Although Conte sought ways to reduce\n\n                             -9-\n\nexpenses  without  dismissing  personnel,  he  concluded,  in\n\nSeptember and  early October 1990, that  personnel cuts would\n\nhave to be made.\n\n          Conte decided, with the approval of Hayes and Human\n\nResources  personnel  in  Cincinnati, to  eliminate  or leave\n\nvacant five  positions in the  Northeast Zone.   Those people\n\ndirectly  affected  by  Conte's  decision  included  LeBlanc,\n\nWilliam  St.  George,   a  forty-seven-year-old   underwriter\n\nworking in  the  Windsor, Connecticut,  headquarters  of  the\n\nNortheast Zone, and  Dwight Bowie, the  thirty-eight-year-old\n\nProfit Center Manager in Hartford, Connecticut.  In addition,\n\ntwo  other  vacant  positions  in  the  Northeast  Zone  were\n\neliminated.   They included the AOR Manager  in the Syracuse,\n\nNew York, office, a position that had already been vacated by\n\nthe  resignation  of  Tim  Johnson, age  twenty-six,  and  an\n\nunderwriting position in Hartford, Connecticut, that had been\n\nvacant for some time.\n\n          On  October  19,   1990,  Great  American  informed\n\nLeBlanc that he was  being dismissed.  LeBlanc was  told that\n\nthe  decision to eliminate  his position was  based on budget\n\nconstraints, and  not because  of his  age or  his individual\n\nperformance.      Immediately   after  LeBlanc's   discharge,\n\nDeMartino,  the remaining AOR  in eastern  Massachusetts, who\n\nwas then fifty-seven, assumed responsibility for four or five\n\nof  the approximately  fifteen insurance agents  whom LeBlanc\n\n                             -10-\n\nhad  serviced.    The   remaining  agents  were  assigned  to\n\nunderwriters  in  Great  American's Lancaster,  Pennsylvania,\n\noffice, which  was responsible for  underwriting insurance in\n\neastern Massachusetts.\n\n          Approximately nine months later,  in July of  1991,\n\nGreat    American    decided    to   transfer    underwriting\n\nresponsibility for eastern  Massachusetts from the  Lancaster\n\noffice  to the Windsor,  Connecticut, office.   At that time,\n\nAnne   Daley,  a  thirty-year-old   AOR  from   the  Windsor,\n\nConnecticut,  office,  began  to  service  agents  in eastern\n\nMassachusetts.  Daley,  who had been hired by  Great American\n\nprior to LeBlanc's discharge, and who had previously serviced\n\nagents in Connecticut and  western Massachusetts, dropped her\n\nConnecticut  agents  to  service  the  eastern  Massachusetts\n\nagents,   but   continued  to   service  agents   in  western\n\nMassachusetts.    From  July  through  September 1991,  Daley\n\nserviced  some  of  LeBlanc's  former  eastern  Massachusetts\n\nagents.   Daley left Great American in September 1991.  Since\n\nthat time, DeMartino  has been  the only  Great American  AOR\n\nservicing agents in eastern Massachusetts.\n\n                             III.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\nA.

Thus,  rejection of  the\n          defendant's   proffered   reasons,   will\n          permit  the trier  of fact  to  infer the\n                \n          ultimate     fact      of     intentional\n          discrimination . . . .\n\n     U.S.     ,  113  S.

Such evidence, coupled with the elements\n                   \n\nof the employee's prima facie case (and, of course, any other\n\nevidence), may (or may not) lead the factfinder to infer that\n\nthe employer has engaged in intentional discrimination.

The Prima Facie Case\n\n          The  district  court  granted  summary  judgment in\n\nGreat American's favor on the initial ground that LeBlanc had\n\nfailed  to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination.\n\nWhile it  is not clear  to us  that the court  erred in  this\n\nregard, we  prefer    because the question  is so close    to\n\nassume  for present  purposes  that LeBlanc  did establish  a\n\nprima facie  case within the  McDonnell Douglas  formulation.\n                                               \n\nThis leads us, infra, to examine the adequacy of the evidence\n                    \n\nof discriminatory animus,  concluding, as we  do, that it  is\n\ninsufficient to create a triable issue.\n\n          There  is no  direct evidence  that Great  American\n\ndischarged LeBlanc because of his age, and the parties  agree\n\nthat LeBlanc satisfies  the first three of  the four elements\n\n                             -20-\n\nof  his   prima  facie  case  under   the  McDonnell  Douglas\n                                                             \n\nparadigm.3     What  is  disputed  is   whether  LeBlanc  has\n\nestablished  the  fourth element  of  his  prima facie  case.\n\nGreat American argues  that, because this  is a reduction  in\n\nforce  case, LeBlanc must demonstrate    and has failed to do\n\nso      that  Great  American  either  failed  to  treat  age\n\nneutrally in making its decision to terminate him or retained\n\nyounger persons in the same position that he held.4\n\n          LeBlanc maintains that Great American did not treat\n\nage neutrally and that  it retained younger employees  in the\n\nsame  position  that he  held  because,  when Great  American\n\ndischarged him in October 1990, it continued to employ thirty\n\nother younger AORs in the Northeast Zone.  Moreover,  LeBlanc\n\nintimates that  Great American failed to  treat age neutrally\n\nbecause two of the three people whom Great  American actually\n\ndischarged  as  part of  its  reduction  in force,  including\n\nLeBlanc,  were members  of  the protected  class, i.e.,  were\n\n                    \n\n3.  At  the time  of  his discharge,  LeBlanc was  fifty-nine\nyears  of age.    This satisfies  the  first element  of  the\nMcDonnell Douglas standard, which, in age cases, requires the\n                 \nplaintiff to be over the age  of forty.  In addition, LeBlanc\nwas  meeting Great  American's job  performance expectations.\nFinally,  LeBlanc  experienced  adverse   employment  action,\nhaving been discharged.\n\n4.  LeBlanc  does not agree that this is a reduction in force\ncase.   He claims  that Great American's  characterization of\nthis  case as such is  merely a pretext  for Great American's\ndiscriminatory  conduct.     Nevertheless,  even  assuming  a\nreduction  in force  occurred, LeBlanc  contends that  he has\nmade out a prima facie case.  \n\n                             -21-\n\nforty or older.  We are not convinced that  the AOR positions\n\nheld by the  thirty other  AORs elsewhere in  the region  may\n\nproperly  be considered  the  \"same\" position  LeBlanc  held.\n\nWhile  we  agree  that  the  other  AOR  position  in eastern\n\nMassachusetts, which continued to be held by DeMartino (a man\n\nalmost identical in age to LeBlanc), was the \"same\" position,\n\nwe  are less clear that  other AOR positions scattered around\n\nthe region    say,  in Syracuse, New York     were the  same.\n\nCf.  Barnes v. GenCorp Inc.,  896 F.2d 1457,  1465 (6th Cir.)\n                           \n\n(retention of  younger people  in other jobs  which plaintiff\n\nwas  qualified to perform not sufficient to establish a prima\n\nfacie case), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 878, 111 S.

We also question whether  a company can\n\nbe said  not to treat age neutrally as a matter of law merely\n\nbecause two of the  three people it discharges pursuant  to a\n\nreduction in force belong  to the protected class.   A sample\n\nof three is a  small number from which to draw  deductions of\n\nthis sort.   Still, we  shall assume, without  deciding, that\n\nthese  two  facts taken  together  would  satisfy the  fourth\n\nelement  of the McDonnell  Douglas test, bearing  in mind the\n                                  \n\nCourt's admonition that  \"[t]he burden of making  out a prima\n\nfacie  case  is `not  onerous.'\"   Mesnick,  950 F.2d  at 823\n                                          \n\n(quoting  Texas Dep't  of Community  Affairs v.

Great American's Justification\n\n                             -22-\n\n     Assuming,  without necessarily finding, that LeBlanc has\n\nestablished a prima facie case of age discrimination, we turn\n\nnext to the second prong of the McDonnell Douglas test.  This\n                                                 \n\ncalls  for determining whether Great American has articulated\n\na   legitimate,   nondiscriminatory   reason  for   LeBlanc's\n\ndismissal.  We hold that it plainly has. \n\n          Great American maintains that  it reduced its force\n\nin  the Northeast Zone in October 1990 because the region was\n\nexperiencing financial  difficulties.  Al  Conte, then-acting\n\npresident of the Northeast Zone,  stated in an affidavit that\n\nthe   financial  difficulties  in  the  Northeast  Zone  were\n\nattributable  to a  downturn  in the  region's economy,  high\n\nfixed expenses, and  state-mandated residual assessments,  or\n\ngovernment  pooling  requirements, levied  against commercial\n\nlines of insurance.5\n\n          Great American asserts  that it discharged  LeBlanc\n\nas part of this economically-driven reduction in  force for a\n\nnumber of interrelated business reasons.  Conte, who actually\n\nmade  the decision  to eliminate  LeBlanc's  position, stated\n\nthat  he  looked  to eliminate  this  Massachusetts  position\n\nbecause Massachusetts  was the least profitable  state in the\n\n                    \n\n5.  These pooling requirements were charges assessed by state\ngovernments against insurance companies  in certain lines  of\ninsurance  intended to  fund otherwise  uninsurable business.\nThese  charges  were  based  upon  each  insurer's  pro  rata\npercentage  of total  premiums written  in  that state  for a\ngiven line of insurance.\n\n                             -23-\n\nNortheast  Zone.    In  addition, eastern  Massachusetts,  an\n\nextremely small  geographic area,  was being serviced  by two\n\nexperienced AORs, LeBlanc and DeMartino.  Conte believed that\n\neastern  Massachusetts  would  be  the least  harmed  of  the\n\nNortheast Zone regions by the  elimination of a full-time AOR\n\nposition.   Finally,  Conte chose  to retain  DeMartino, then\n\nfifty-eight years old (a  year younger than LeBlanc), because\n\nDeMartino had  a  longer tenure  in Massachusetts  and had  a\n\nclaims  adjusting background, not  possessed by LeBlanc, that\n\nprovided Great American with greater versatility in the event\n\nof hurricanes, storms, or floods.\n\n          The explanations for LeBlanc's discharge offered by\n\nConte  fully satisfy  Great American's  burden of  production\n\nunder the second prong of the McDonnell Douglas test.  It has\n                                               \n\npresented,   \"`through   the   introduction   of   admissible\n\nevidence,' reasons for  its actions which, if believed by the\n                                                             \n\ntrier  of  fact,  would   support  a  finding  that  unlawful\n               \n\ndiscrimination was  not the cause of  the employment action.\"\n\nSt.  Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks,      U.S.    , 113 S. Ct. at\n                               \n\n2747  (quoting  Burdine, 450  U.S.  at  254-55) (emphasis  in\n                       \n\noriginal).       Accordingly,   the   presumption    of   age\n\ndiscrimination  raised  by  LeBlanc's  prima facie  case  has\n\nvanished.  Left to be decided is whether the evidence, in its\n\nentirety, would permit a  reasonable factfinder to infer that\n\n                             -24-\n\nGreat American's decision  to terminate LeBlanc was  inspired\n\nby age animus.\n\n     4.   LeBlanc's Evidence of Age Animus\n\n          LeBlanc  points  to  two  types  of  circumstantial\n\nevidence  as supporting  an inference  that  Great American's\n\ndecision to  terminate him  was motivated by  intentional age\n\ndiscrimination.   First,  LeBlanc contends  that the  reasons\n\narticulated  by Great  American  for his  dismissal could  be\n\nfound to be mere pretexts offered to disguise the defendant's\n\nage animus.  Second,  LeBlanc argues that certain statistical\n\nevidence he  presented suffices  to show that  Great American\n\nwas engaging  in a pattern of  discriminatory conduct towards\n\nolder employees.\n\n          a.   Evidence of Pretext\n\n          LeBlanc  submits  that  a  layoff   of  only  three\n\nemployees  out  of  212  salaried, exempt  employees  in  the\n\nNortheast  Zone  cannot  be  characterized  as  a  bona  fide\n\nreduction  in  force.6     Moreover,  he  claims  that  Great\n\nAmerican  did not engage in  a reduction in  force because it\n\nhired ten  new  AORs in  1990  prior to  his dismissal.    We\n\nconclude,  however, that  a reasonable  factfinder could  not\n\ninfer pretext or age discrimination from these circumstances.\n\n                    \n\n6.  Although  LeBlanc  fails  to   spell  out  the   specific\ncharacteristics of a reduction in force as he understands the\nterm, he insists that  a true reduction in force  occurs, for\ninstance, when 1,000 employees  out of an employee population\nof 5,500 are dismissed.\n\n                             -25-\n\n          An employer need not dismiss  any particular number\n\nof employees,  or  terminate a  set  percentage of  the  work\n\nforce,  to institute a reduction in force.  Rather, \"[a] work\n\nforce reduction situation occurs when business considerations\n                                                             \n\ncause an employer  to eliminate one or  more positions within\n                                                             \n\nthe  company.\"   Barnes  v. GenCorp  Inc.,  896 F.2d  at 1465\n                                         \n\n(emphasis added).   According  to Al Conte,  Great American's\n\ncorporate headquarters ordered him  to submit a leaner budget\n\nfor the Northeast Zone  for the upcoming year because  it was\n\nconcerned  about the  region's  financial difficulties.    To\n\ncomply, Conte decided that it would be necessary to eliminate\n\nfive  positions, two  of  which were  unfilled  at the  time.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the fact that Conte laid off  only\n\nthree employees,  including LeBlanc,  as part of  his claimed\n\ninitiative  to trim expenses does not  by itself suggest that\n\nthe  dismissals  were mere  pretexts  rather  than bona  fide\n\nreductions  in force.   Other evidence  would be  needed from\n\nwhich to  conclude that Great American's  stated reasons were\n\nmendacious.\n\n          Nor could a rational factfinder conclude that Great\n\nAmerican's purported reduction in force was a pretext for age\n\ndiscrimination  simply  because  it  hired ten  younger  AORs\n\nelsewhere  in  the  Northeast   Zone  in  the  period  before\n\ndischarging  LeBlanc in  October 1990.   LeBlanc  provides no\n\nevidence  that the hiring of  younger AORs outside of eastern\n\n                             -26-\n\nMassachusetts  was  tied  in  any  way  to  Great  American's\n\ndecision to eliminate the older LeBlanc's position in eastern\n\nMassachusetts;  nothing suggests  they  were hired  to assume\n\nLeBlanc's   responsibilities.     LeBlanc   submits   that  a\n\nreasonable   juror   might   conclude  that   a   company  as\n\nsophisticated as Great American would not legitimately decide\n\nto  engage in a reduction  in force shortly  after adding ten\n\nnew  positions.   But to  reach any  such conclusion  on this\n\nrecord,  a  juror  would  have to  indulge  impermissibly  in\n\nunsupported speculation.   See  Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d  at 8.\n                                            \n\nOne  can  imagine  perfectly  legitimate  considerations  for\n\nincreasing the number  of AORs elsewhere in  the region while\n\ncutting back in eastern  Massachusetts.  It is not  a court's\n\nrole \"to second-guess the business decisions of an employer.\"\n\nPetitti v. New England Tel. &amp;  Tel. Co., 909 F.2d 28, 31 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1990).   \n\n          LeBlanc  also  claims  that  he  was  not dismissed\n\npursuant to a reduction  in force because he was  replaced by\n\nAnne Daley.  It is true that \"[a]n employee is not eliminated\n\nas part  of a work force reduction when he or she is replaced\n\nafter  his  or her  discharge.\"   Barnes,  896 F.2d  at 1457.\n                                        \n\nNonetheless, Daley  did not,  in  fact, replace  LeBlanc.   A\n\ndischarged employee   \"is not replaced  when another employee\n\nis assigned to perform the plaintiff's duties in  addition to\n\nother  duties, or when the  work is redistributed among other\n\n                             -27-\n\nexisting  employees  already performing  related work.\"   Id.\n                                                             \n\nRather, \"[a] person is replaced only when another employee is\n\nhired or reassigned to perform the plaintiff's duties.\"  Id.\n                                                            \n\n          Daley  was not  hired to perform  LeBlanc's duties.\n\nShe  began  working  for   Great  American  in  its  Windsor,\n\nConnecticut, office one month  before LeBlanc was discharged,\n\nand  did not begin to  service agents and  brokers in eastern\n\nMassachusetts  until  July  1991,  approximately  nine months\n\nafter  LeBlanc's  departure.   Prior  to  then, she  serviced\n\nagents only  in Connecticut and western  Massachusetts.  Even\n\nin  July 1991, and thereafter, Daley did not perform anything\n\nlike  all  of  LeBlanc's  former  duties.    Moreover,  while\n\nassigned to some (though not all) of LeBlanc's former  agents\n\nin eastern Massachusetts, she  continued to service agents in\n\nwestern  Massachusetts.     Thus,  at  most,  her   temporary\n\nassignment   included  performing  some  of  LeBlanc's  prior\n\nresponsibilities while  carrying on  duties of her  own never\n\nperformed  by him.    And even  this  partial performance  of\n\nLeBlanc's  duties lasted for only three months.  This did not\n\namount to replacing him.7 \n\n          LeBlanc next  disputes Great American's  claim that\n\nit was experiencing  financial difficulties in the  Northeast\n\nZone and in Massachusetts  in 1990.  LeBlanc opines  that the\n\n                    \n\n7.  Since  September 1991,  when  Daley  resigned from  Great\nAmerican,  Charles DeMartino has been the only AOR in eastern\nMassachusetts.\n\n                             -28-\n\nprimary method for determining  whether a particular state or\n\na branch  office  is  profitable  is  by  comparing  what  is\n\nreferred to  as the total  benchmark figure (\"TBM\")  with the\n\ntotal loss ratio (\"TOT\").  According to LeBlanc, when the TBM\n\nfigure  exceeds the  TOT figure,  it  reflects profitability.\n\nLeBlanc  asserts that  Great American's  Gross Accident  Year\n\nAnalysis  Report (\"GAYAR\")  showed that,  for the  years 1987\n\nthrough 1991, Massachusetts was the only state among the four\n\nlargest producing states in the Northeast  Zone8 consistently\n\nto have a TBM figure that exceeded its TOT figure.    \n\n          The GAYAR,  however, was  only one of  many records\n\nkept   by  Great   American  that   measured   the  company's\n\nprofitability  in the  Northeast Zone  and in  Massachusetts.\n\nThe  Effective Accident  Year Report  for Massachusetts,  for\n\ninstance, revealed that, in 1990, the TOT figure exceeded the\n\nTBM  figure  fifty  to  forty-three.9    This  was  a  strong\n\nindication of unprofitability in Massachusetts.  In addition,\n\nthe profit and loss statements for the various offices in the\n\nNortheast  Zone  revealed  that the  region  was experiencing\n\n                    \n\n8.  The other  three states  were New York,  New Jersey,  and\nConnecticut.\n\n9.  The  difference  between  the  GAYAR  and  the  Effective\nAccident Year Report is that the former measured loss  ratios\non  a  policy  year/accident  year  basis  while  the  latter\nmeasured  loss ratios on a calendar year basis.  According to\nRobert McGuigan, who was  a vice-president for Great American\nat the time of LeBlanc's discharge, executives would evaluate\nthe calendar  year loss ratios, not  the policy year/accident\nyear loss ratios, to assess profitability.\n\n                             -29-\n\nfinancial difficulties in 1990.   For instance, the Lancaster\n\nbranch office,  to  which the  eastern  Massachusetts  region\n\nreported, showed a calendar year underwriting loss in 1990 of\n\napproximately  $3.7  million; the  New  Jersey profit  center\n\nreported a calendar year underwriting loss in 1990 of roughly\n\n$4.5 million;  and the New  England profit center  suffered a\n\ncalendar year underwriting loss in 1990 of approximately $3.8\n\nmillion.   All told,  the Northeast Zone  incurred a calendar\n\nyear underwriting loss in 1990 of $11.8 million.10\n\n          Given  this  evidence   of  substantial   financial\n\ndifficulty,  we   can  find  no  triable   issue  over  Great\n\nAmerican's assertion that unprofitability concerns fueled its\n\ndecision to lay off LeBlanc and the others.  The question for\n\na jury would not be whether Great American's finances, viewed\n\nby one yardstick, might arguably be seen by someone else in a\n\nmore  optimistic light  than  did its  managers, but  whether\n\nthere was  evidence of profitable  performance sufficient  to\n\npermit  a  reasonable jury  to  infer  that Great  American's\n\nproffered pessimistic analysis     given as a reason  for the\n\nlayoffs     was a mere  pretense.  Viewing  all the financial\n\nevidence together, including the GAYAR  data, we think a jury\n\nwould lack any rational basis from this evidence to  conclude\n\n                    \n\n10.  This  loss  appears  to   be  particularly  severe  when\ncompared  to the  $111  thousand calendar  year  underwriting\nprofit that the Northeast Zone realized in 1989.\n\n                             -30-\n\nthat Great  American's assertions of financial  concern, as a\n\nbasis for the discharges, were a sham.\n\n          Finally,  LeBlanc argues  that further  evidence of\n\nthe pretextual  nature of  Great  American's explanation  for\n\nterminating  LeBlanc lies in the  fact that Al  Conte did not\n\nconsult  with Bruce  Rutherford,  the branch  manager of  the\n\nLancaster  office and  the person  to whom  LeBlanc reported,\n\nbefore he made  the final  decision to dismiss  LeBlanc.   In\n\naddition,  LeBlanc  asserts  that  Joseph  Klimas, the  vice-\n\npresident in charge of personnel for  the Northeast Zone, did\n\nnot learn about LeBlanc's  impending dismissal until one week\n\nbefore  it was  officially announced.   Although  Conte might\n\nhave  been  well served  to  consult these  people  before he\n\ndecided to discharge LeBlanc, we  are not persuaded that this\n\nevidence either undermines the justifications  given by Great\n\nAmerican for its  decision to dismiss  LeBlanc or shows  that\n\nGreat American or Conte  was motivated by age animus.   As we\n\nstated in  Mesnick v. General  Electric Co., \"Courts  may not\n                                           \n\nsit as  super personnel departments, assessing the merits  or\n\neven   the   rationality  of   employers'   nondiscriminatory\n\nbusiness decisions.\"   950 F.2d  at 825.   LeBlanc points  to\n\nnothing in the record  to suggest why Conte, who,  in January\n\n1989,  approved  LeBlanc's  transfer,  at   Great  American's\n\nexpense,  to  eastern  Massachusetts  and  his  corresponding\n\nsixteen percent pay raise, would develop an aversion to older\n\n                             -31-\n\npeople less than two  years later, especially where  he chose\n\nto retain DeMartino, the  other AOR in eastern Massachusetts,\n\nwho  was only  a  year younger  than the  fifty-nine-year-old\n\nLeBlanc.  See Lowe v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., 963  F.2d 173,\n                                             \n\n175 (8th Cir. 1992); Proud v.  Stone, 945 F.2d 796, 797  (4th\n                                    \n\nCir. 1991) (\"[I]n cases where the hirer and the firer are the\n\nsame  individual and  the  termination  of employment  occurs\n\nwithin a relatively short time  span following the hiring,  a\n\nstrong  inference  exists  that  discrimination  was   not  a\n\ndetermining  factor  for  the  adverse action  taken  by  the\n\nemployer.\").  We  note that Conte, himself, was  nearly sixty\n\nyears  old  when he  decided  to  terminate LeBlanc  and  the\n\nothers. \n\n          b.   Statistical Evidence\n\n          LeBlanc  offers  statistical   evidence  of   Great\n\nAmerican's employment practices that  he claims would allow a\n\nreasonable  trier  of fact  to  infer  that Great  American's\n\ndecision to terminate him  constituted an act of illegal  age\n\ndiscrimination.      The  district   court,   however,  found\n\notherwise.   It ruled  that, in light of  the totality of the\n\nrecord, LeBlanc's statistical evidence  was insufficient as a\n\nmatter of  law to demonstrate that  Great American wrongfully\n\nconsidered  age in its decision to dismiss LeBlanc.  We agree\n\nwith the district court.\n\n                             -32-\n\n          In   a   disparate    treatment   case   such    as\n\nLeBlanc's,11  the central  focus \"is  less whether  a pattern\n\nof discrimination  existed [at  the company]  and more  how a\n\nparticular  individual was  treated, and  why.\"   Cumpiano v.\n                                                          \n\nBanco Santander P.R.,  902 F.2d 148, 156 (1st Cir. 1990).  As\n                    \n\nsuch,  statistical evidence  of  a  company's general  hiring\n\npatterns,  although relevant,  carries less  probative weight\n\nthan it does  in a  disparate impact case.12   See id.;  Mack\n                                                             \n\nv. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 184 n.3 (1st Cir.\n                            \n\n1989) (questioning how statistics showing a low percentage of\n\nAfrican  Americans and  women  at  A  &amp;  P  would  have  been\n\nadmissible in a disparate treatment  case).  In this context,\n\nstatistical evidence in a disparate treatment case, in and of\n\nitself, rarely  suffices to  rebut an  employer's legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory rationale for  its decision  to dismiss  an\n\nindividual employee.  See  Walther v. Lone Star Gas  Co., 977\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 161, 162 (5th  Cir. 1992).  This is because  a company's\n\noverall employment  statistics will, in at  least many cases,\n\nhave little direct bearing on the  specific intentions of the\n\n                    \n\n11.  A \"disparate treatment\" cause of action accrues \"when an\nemployer  treats  an  employee  less  favorably  than  others\nbecause  of  her  race,  color, religion,  sex,  []  national\norigin,\"  or age.  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d\n                                                   \n148, 156 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n12.  Disparate   impact   actions   arise  \"from   employment\npractices,  often  facially  neutral,  which  (1)  cannot  be\njustified  by  business  necessity  and (2)  in  fact  impose\nharsher   burdens  on   employees   who  share   a  protected\ncharacteristic.\"  Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 156.\n                          \n\n                             -33-\n\nemployer when dismissing a  particular individual.  Gadson v.\n                                                          \n\nConcord Hosp.,  966 F.2d 32, 35 (1st Cir. 1992).  \"Without an\n             \n\nindication  of  a  connection  between  the  statistics,\" the\n\npractices   of  the   employer,  and  the   employee's  case,\n\nstatistics alone are likely to be inadequate to show that the\n\nemployer's   decision   to   discharge   the   employee   was\n\nimpermissibly based on age.  Id.\n                                \n\n          In the instant case, we do not think that LeBlanc's\n\nstatistical evidence  would allow a reasonable  trier of fact\n\nto  infer   that  Great  American  engaged   in  illegal  age\n\ndiscrimination  against LeBlanc.   The  statistics themselves\n\nare  of questionable  import,  and  they  stand  precariously\n\nunsupported    by   other    probative   evidence    of   age\n\ndiscrimination.   There is, moreover, no  evidence whatsoever\n\nto  connect  the  statistics  to  Great  American's  specific\n\ndecision to dismiss LeBlanc.  \n\n          The flaws  in the statistical  evidence itself  are\n\nnotable.   First,  the comparison  of LeBlanc's age  with the\n\ndistribution  of  ages  in  various  groups of  AORs  in  the\n\nNortheast  Zone  from  1989  through 1991  fails  to  provide\n\nimportant information  regarding the pool of  applicants.  We\n\nare  not  told   whether  \"qualified  older  employees   were\n\navailable or  applied for those  jobs.\"  Simpson  v. Midland-\n                                                             \n\nRoss Corp., 823 F.2d 937,  943 (6th Cir. 1987).   Indeed, the\n          \n\nfact that recently hired AORs are younger than LeBlanc is not\n\n                             -34-\n\nnecessarily evidence of discriminatory intent, but may simply\n\nreflect a younger available work force.  \n\n          Second, LeBlanc's statistics  that compare the ages\n\nof  the employees who left Great American for any reason from\n\n1989 through 1991  with the ages of  Great American employees\n\nwho kept  their jobs during  the period  fail to  distinguish\n\nvoluntary  from involuntary departures.  Voluntary departures\n\nobviously have  no bearing on whether  Great American engaged\n\nin age discrimination.  See id. (improper to include \"all who\n                               \n\nleft the company during the relevant  period even though they\n\nmight have  retired . . .  or accepted jobs elsewhere\").   In\n\naddition, of  the twenty-two  people who left  Great American\n\neither  voluntarily  or involuntarily  during  the three-year\n\nperiod, seventeen left in  1991, the year following LeBlanc's\n\ndismissal.  Significantly, the average age of those seventeen\n\npeople  was  actually younger  than  the average  age  of the\n\nemployees  who stayed with  Great American.13   We cannot see\n\nhow  the data  from  1991  demonstrate  any  pattern  of  age\n\ndiscrimination whatsoever.   Accordingly, if we disregard the\n\ndata  from  1991,  LeBlanc's  statistics  are  based  on  the\n\ndeparture of only five employees, including LeBlanc, over two\n\n                    \n\n13.  Even  when the  1990  hires and  the  trainees, who  are\npresumably younger in age  than other employees, are excluded\nfrom  the employee  pool  during the  three-year period,  the\nstatistical comparisons between jobs that were eliminated and\njobs  that  were  not eliminated  in  1991  do  not raise  an\ninference of age discrimination.\n\n                             -35-\n\nyears  from  an average  annual  employee  population in  the\n\nNortheast  Zone of approximately 215 people.  \"[S]uch a small\n\nstatistical sample  carries little  or no probative  force to\n\nshow discrimination.\"   Fallis v.

We\n                      \n\nconclude that LeBlanc's statistical evidence does not provide\n\na sufficient basis for  a reasonable jury to find  that Great\n\nAmerican terminated LeBlanc because of his age.\n\n                             IV.\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n\n          On  the record before us, we  find that LeBlanc has\n\nadduced insufficient evidence for  a reasonable trier of fact\n\nto  infer that  Great  American's decision  to terminate  his\n\nemployment in October 1990  was motivated by age animus.   In\n\nother words, \"[t]he evidence  presented by [LeBlanc],  viewed\n\nin  the  light most  favorable to  him,  [fails] to  create a\n\ngenuine issue of  material fact  as to whether  `but for  his\n\nemployer's motive to discriminate  against him because of his\n\nage, [LeBlanc] would  not have been discharged.'\"   Menard v.\n                                                          \n\nFirst  Sec.

On  October 19,\n                                          \n\n1990,  the  defendant-appellee,   Great  American   Insurance\n\nCompany (\"Great American\"), terminated its employment of  the\n\nplaintiff-appellant, Theodore L. LeBlanc, who was then fifty-\n\nnine  years old.  LeBlanc brought this action in the district\n\ncourt  against  his  former  employer  pursuant  to  the  Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act  (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C.    621-\n\n634  (1985 &amp; Supp.  1993), and Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  151B,   4.\n\nThe   district  court  entered   summary  judgment  in  Great\n\nAmerican's favor, and this appeal followed.  We affirm. \n\n                              I.\n\n                         JURISDICTION\n\n          Great American contends that  this court is without\n\njurisdiction over LeBlanc's appeal  from the district court's\n\norder granting summary judgment in its favor.  To follow this\n\nargument,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  the  procedural\n\nhistory of this case.\n\n          The  district  court  rendered its  final  judgment\n\ngranting summary  judgment to  Great American on  November 2,\n\n1992.   On  November  10, LeBlanc  moved for  reconsideration\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  On December 2, 1992, while this\n\nmotion for reconsideration was still pending, LeBlanc filed a\n\nnotice  of appeal from the November 2, 1992, grant of summary\n\njudgment.   Because at the  time LeBlanc filed  his notice of\n\nappeal  the district  court had  not yet  ruled  on LeBlanc's\n\n                             -4-\n\nmotion  for  reconsideration,  we  determined  that  we  were\n\nwithout  jurisdiction to consider  the appeal and accordingly\n\ndismissed  it.   On  December 21,  1992,  the district  court\n\ndenied LeBlanc's motion for reconsideration.  LeBlanc filed a\n\nsecond notice of appeal on December 28.  The second notice of\n\nappeal asked for relief \"from the Order entered  December 21,\n\n1992, denying  Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration  of the\n\ncourt's  previously  entered  order  of   November  2,  1992,\n\ngranting  summary  judgment  in  favor  of   defendant  Great\n\nAmerican Insurance Companies [sic].\"\n\n          Great American argues that LeBlanc's  second notice\n\nof appeal,  because it  only challenges the  district court's\n\ndenial on  December 21, 1992 of LeBlanc's  Rule 59(e) motion,\n\ndoes not confer jurisdiction upon  this court to entertain an\n\nappeal  from the  district  court's judgment  of November  2,\n\n1992, granting summary judgment.  Appellee insists we possess\n\njurisdiction only  to consider the  narrower factors relevant\n\nto  the  district  court's  denial of  LeBlanc's  motion  for\n\nreconsideration.  We disagree.\n\n          It  is true that Fed.  R. App. P.  3(c) states that\n\n\"[t]he notice of appeal shall specify the . . . order or part\n\nthereof   appealed   from.\"     Rule  3(c)'s   \"commands  are\n\njurisdictional  and mandatory.\"   Kotler v.

LeBlanc's  intent to  appeal  from  the\n\ndistrict court's November 2,  1992, grant of summary judgment\n\nwas plain.  The two notices taken together revealed LeBlanc's\n\ndesire to appeal not just from the motion for reconsideration\n\nbut also from the underlying judgment.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n          Great American  is an  all lines insurance  company\n\nwith  its headquarters  in Cincinnati, Ohio.   As  of October\n\n1990, when  Great American dismissed LeBlanc,  Great American\n\nwas divided into four geographical regions: Northeast, South,\n\nMidwest,  and  West.    In  addition  to  these  geographical\n\ndivisions,  Great American  was  organized according  to  the\n\nlines  of  business,   distinguishing  between  personal  and\n\ncommercial lines of insurance.  At the time of his discharge,\n\nLeBlanc was  employed by Great American  Northeast, Inc. (the\n\n\"Northeast Zone\") in its commercial lines division.\n\n          Great American  hired LeBlanc in October  1980 as a\n\nbranch manager  in its  Wheaton, Maryland,  office.   At that\n\ntime, LeBlanc  was forty-nine years  old.  From  1980 through\n\n1988,  LeBlanc worked  for Great  American in  Maryland.   In\n\n                             -8-\n\nJanuary  1989,  Great American  transferred  the fifty-seven-\n\nyear-old LeBlanc, with his consent, to  eastern Massachusetts\n\nto   serve   as   a   commercial   lines   Agency  Operations\n\nRepresentative  (\"AOR\").   The  transfer was  approved by  Al\n\nConte, then-acting president of  the Northeast Zone, who also\n\nagreed to pay for LeBlanc's moving expenses and to give him a\n\nsixteen percent pay raise.\n\n          In his capacity as an AOR, LeBlanc  was expected to\n\nmarket  Great American  commercial  insurance to  independent\n\nagents or  brokers in eastern Massachusetts  and assist those\n\nagents and brokers who  were already selling Great American's\n\ninsurance  products.    When   LeBlanc  started  in   eastern\n\nMassachusetts,  he joined  Charles DeMartino,  then fifty-six\n\nyears  old,  as one  of  two  AORs marketing  Great  American\n\ncommercial lines insurance in eastern Massachusetts.  LeBlanc\n\nand DeMartino worked together in eastern  Massachusetts until\n\nLeBlanc's discharge.\n\n          According  to Great  American's evidence,  which is\n\nnot  contradicted, the  decision to  dismiss LeBlanc  had its\n\ngenesis  in August 1990, when Conte began to prepare a budget\n\nfor  the upcoming year for  the Northeast Zone.   Because the\n\nNortheast  Zone  was experiencing  financial problems  at the\n\ntime,   Thomas  Hayes,  Executive   Vice-President  of  Great\n\nAmerican,  instructed  Conte to  submit  a  leaner budget  to\n\ncorporate headquarters.  Although Conte sought ways to reduce\n\n                             -9-\n\nexpenses  without  dismissing  personnel,  he  concluded,  in\n\nSeptember and  early October 1990, that  personnel cuts would\n\nhave to be made.\n\n          Conte decided, with the approval of Hayes and Human\n\nResources  personnel  in  Cincinnati, to  eliminate  or leave\n\nvacant five  positions in the  Northeast Zone.   Those people\n\ndirectly  affected  by  Conte's  decision  included  LeBlanc,\n\nWilliam  St.  George,   a  forty-seven-year-old   underwriter\n\nworking in  the  Windsor, Connecticut,  headquarters  of  the\n\nNortheast Zone, and  Dwight Bowie, the  thirty-eight-year-old\n\nProfit Center Manager in Hartford, Connecticut.  In addition,\n\ntwo  other  vacant  positions  in  the  Northeast  Zone  were\n\neliminated.   They included the AOR Manager  in the Syracuse,\n\nNew York, office, a position that had already been vacated by\n\nthe  resignation  of  Tim  Johnson, age  twenty-six,  and  an\n\nunderwriting position in Hartford, Connecticut, that had been\n\nvacant for some time.\n\n          On  October  19,   1990,  Great  American  informed\n\nLeBlanc that he was  being dismissed.  LeBlanc was  told that\n\nthe  decision to eliminate  his position was  based on budget\n\nconstraints, and  not because  of his  age or  his individual\n\nperformance.      Immediately   after  LeBlanc's   discharge,\n\nDeMartino,  the remaining AOR  in eastern  Massachusetts, who\n\nwas then fifty-seven, assumed responsibility for four or five\n\nof  the approximately  fifteen insurance agents  whom LeBlanc\n\n                             -10-\n\nhad  serviced.    The   remaining  agents  were  assigned  to\n\nunderwriters  in  Great  American's Lancaster,  Pennsylvania,\n\noffice, which  was responsible for  underwriting insurance in\n\neastern Massachusetts.\n\n          Approximately nine months later,  in July of  1991,\n\nGreat    American    decided    to   transfer    underwriting\n\nresponsibility for eastern  Massachusetts from the  Lancaster\n\noffice  to the Windsor,  Connecticut, office.   At that time,\n\nAnne   Daley,  a  thirty-year-old   AOR  from   the  Windsor,\n\nConnecticut,  office,  began  to  service  agents  in eastern\n\nMassachusetts.  Daley,  who had been hired by  Great American\n\nprior to LeBlanc's discharge, and who had previously serviced\n\nagents in Connecticut and  western Massachusetts, dropped her\n\nConnecticut  agents  to  service  the  eastern  Massachusetts\n\nagents,   but   continued  to   service  agents   in  western\n\nMassachusetts.    From  July  through  September 1991,  Daley\n\nserviced  some  of  LeBlanc's  former  eastern  Massachusetts\n\nagents.   Daley left Great American in September 1991.  Since\n\nthat time, DeMartino  has been  the only  Great American  AOR\n\nservicing agents in eastern Massachusetts.\n\n                             III.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\nA.

The Prima Facie Case\n\n          The  district  court  granted  summary  judgment in\n\nGreat American's favor on the initial ground that LeBlanc had\n\nfailed  to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination.\n\nWhile it  is not clear  to us  that the court  erred in  this\n\nregard, we  prefer    because the question  is so close    to\n\nassume  for present  purposes  that LeBlanc  did establish  a\n\nprima facie  case within the  McDonnell Douglas  formulation.\n                                               \n\nThis leads us, infra, to examine the adequacy of the evidence\n                    \n\nof discriminatory animus,  concluding, as we  do, that it  is\n\ninsufficient to create a triable issue.\n\n          There  is no  direct evidence  that Great  American\n\ndischarged LeBlanc because of his age, and the parties  agree\n\nthat LeBlanc satisfies  the first three of  the four elements\n\n                             -20-\n\nof  his   prima  facie  case  under   the  McDonnell  Douglas\n                                                             \n\nparadigm.3     What  is  disputed  is   whether  LeBlanc  has\n\nestablished  the  fourth element  of  his  prima facie  case.\n\nGreat American argues  that, because this  is a reduction  in\n\nforce  case, LeBlanc must demonstrate    and has failed to do\n\nso      that  Great  American  either  failed  to  treat  age\n\nneutrally in making its decision to terminate him or retained\n\nyounger persons in the same position that he held.4\n\n          LeBlanc maintains that Great American did not treat\n\nage neutrally and that  it retained younger employees  in the\n\nsame  position  that he  held  because,  when Great  American\n\ndischarged him in October 1990, it continued to employ thirty\n\nother younger AORs in the Northeast Zone.  Moreover,  LeBlanc\n\nintimates that  Great American failed to  treat age neutrally\n\nbecause two of the three people whom Great  American actually\n\ndischarged  as  part of  its  reduction  in force,  including\n\nLeBlanc,  were members  of  the protected  class, i.e.,  were\n\n                    \n\n3.  At  the time  of  his discharge,  LeBlanc was  fifty-nine\nyears  of age.    This satisfies  the  first element  of  the\nMcDonnell Douglas standard, which, in age cases, requires the\n                 \nplaintiff to be over the age  of forty.  In addition, LeBlanc\nwas  meeting Great  American's job  performance expectations.\nFinally,  LeBlanc  experienced  adverse   employment  action,\nhaving been discharged.\n\n4.  LeBlanc  does not agree that this is a reduction in force\ncase.   He claims  that Great American's  characterization of\nthis  case as such is  merely a pretext  for Great American's\ndiscriminatory  conduct.     Nevertheless,  even  assuming  a\nreduction  in force  occurred, LeBlanc  contends that  he has\nmade out a prima facie case.  \n\n                             -21-\n\nforty or older.  We are not convinced that  the AOR positions\n\nheld by the  thirty other  AORs elsewhere in  the region  may\n\nproperly  be considered  the  \"same\" position  LeBlanc  held.\n\nWhile  we  agree  that  the  other  AOR  position  in eastern\n\nMassachusetts, which continued to be held by DeMartino (a man\n\nalmost identical in age to LeBlanc), was the \"same\" position,\n\nwe  are less clear that  other AOR positions scattered around\n\nthe region    say,  in Syracuse, New York     were the  same.\n\nCf.

Great American's Justification\n\n                             -22-\n\n     Assuming,  without necessarily finding, that LeBlanc has\n\nestablished a prima facie case of age discrimination, we turn\n\nnext to the second prong of the McDonnell Douglas test.  This\n                                                 \n\ncalls  for determining whether Great American has articulated\n\na   legitimate,   nondiscriminatory   reason  for   LeBlanc's\n\ndismissal.  We hold that it plainly has. \n\n          Great American maintains that  it reduced its force\n\nin  the Northeast Zone in October 1990 because the region was\n\nexperiencing financial  difficulties.  Al  Conte, then-acting\n\npresident of the Northeast Zone,  stated in an affidavit that\n\nthe   financial  difficulties  in  the  Northeast  Zone  were\n\nattributable  to a  downturn  in the  region's economy,  high\n\nfixed expenses, and  state-mandated residual assessments,  or\n\ngovernment  pooling  requirements, levied  against commercial\n\nlines of insurance.5\n\n          Great American asserts  that it discharged  LeBlanc\n\nas part of this economically-driven reduction in  force for a\n\nnumber of interrelated business reasons.  Conte, who actually\n\nmade  the decision  to eliminate  LeBlanc's  position, stated\n\nthat  he  looked  to eliminate  this  Massachusetts  position\n\nbecause Massachusetts  was the least profitable  state in the\n\n                    \n\n5.  These pooling requirements were charges assessed by state\ngovernments against insurance companies  in certain lines  of\ninsurance  intended to  fund otherwise  uninsurable business.\nThese  charges  were  based  upon  each  insurer's  pro  rata\npercentage  of total  premiums written  in  that state  for a\ngiven line of insurance.\n\n                             -23-\n\nNortheast  Zone.    In  addition, eastern  Massachusetts,  an\n\nextremely small  geographic area,  was being serviced  by two\n\nexperienced AORs, LeBlanc and DeMartino.  Conte believed that\n\neastern  Massachusetts  would  be  the least  harmed  of  the\n\nNortheast Zone regions by the  elimination of a full-time AOR\n\nposition.   Finally,  Conte chose  to retain  DeMartino, then\n\nfifty-eight years old (a  year younger than LeBlanc), because\n\nDeMartino had  a  longer tenure  in Massachusetts  and had  a\n\nclaims  adjusting background, not  possessed by LeBlanc, that\n\nprovided Great American with greater versatility in the event\n\nof hurricanes, storms, or floods.\n\n          The explanations for LeBlanc's discharge offered by\n\nConte  fully satisfy  Great American's  burden of  production\n\nunder the second prong of the McDonnell Douglas test.

Accordingly,   the   presumption    of   age\n\ndiscrimination  raised  by  LeBlanc's  prima facie  case  has\n\nvanished.  Left to be decided is whether the evidence, in its\n\nentirety, would permit a  reasonable factfinder to infer that\n\n                             -24-\n\nGreat American's decision  to terminate LeBlanc was  inspired\n\nby age animus.\n\n     4.   LeBlanc's Evidence of Age Animus\n\n          LeBlanc  points  to  two  types  of  circumstantial\n\nevidence  as supporting  an inference  that  Great American's\n\ndecision to  terminate him  was motivated by  intentional age\n\ndiscrimination.   First,  LeBlanc contends  that the  reasons\n\narticulated  by Great  American  for his  dismissal could  be\n\nfound to be mere pretexts offered to disguise the defendant's\n\nage animus.  Second,  LeBlanc argues that certain statistical\n\nevidence he  presented suffices  to show that  Great American\n\nwas engaging  in a pattern of  discriminatory conduct towards\n\nolder employees.\n\n          a.   Evidence of Pretext\n\n          LeBlanc  submits  that  a  layoff   of  only  three\n\nemployees  out  of  212  salaried, exempt  employees  in  the\n\nNortheast  Zone  cannot  be  characterized  as  a  bona  fide\n\nreduction  in  force.6     Moreover,  he  claims  that  Great\n\nAmerican  did not engage in  a reduction in  force because it\n\nhired ten  new  AORs in  1990  prior to  his dismissal.    We\n\nconclude,  however, that  a reasonable  factfinder could  not\n\ninfer pretext or age discrimination from these circumstances.\n\n                    \n\n6.  Although  LeBlanc  fails  to   spell  out  the   specific\ncharacteristics of a reduction in force as he understands the\nterm, he insists that  a true reduction in force  occurs, for\ninstance, when 1,000 employees  out of an employee population\nof 5,500 are dismissed.\n\n                             -25-\n\n          An employer need not dismiss  any particular number\n\nof employees,  or  terminate a  set  percentage of  the  work\n\nforce,  to institute a reduction in force.  Rather, \"[a] work\n\nforce reduction situation occurs when business considerations\n                                                             \n\ncause an employer  to eliminate one or  more positions within\n                                                             \n\nthe  company.\"   Barnes  v.

According  to Al Conte,  Great American's\n\ncorporate headquarters ordered him  to submit a leaner budget\n\nfor the Northeast Zone  for the upcoming year because  it was\n\nconcerned  about the  region's  financial difficulties.    To\n\ncomply, Conte decided that it would be necessary to eliminate\n\nfive  positions, two  of  which were  unfilled  at the  time.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the fact that Conte laid off  only\n\nthree employees,  including LeBlanc,  as part of  his claimed\n\ninitiative  to trim expenses does not  by itself suggest that\n\nthe  dismissals  were mere  pretexts  rather  than bona  fide\n\nreductions  in force.   Other evidence  would be  needed from\n\nwhich to  conclude that Great American's  stated reasons were\n\nmendacious.\n\n          Nor could a rational factfinder conclude that Great\n\nAmerican's purported reduction in force was a pretext for age\n\ndiscrimination  simply  because  it  hired ten  younger  AORs\n\nelsewhere  in  the  Northeast   Zone  in  the  period  before\n\ndischarging  LeBlanc in  October 1990.   LeBlanc  provides no\n\nevidence  that the hiring of  younger AORs outside of eastern\n\n                             -26-\n\nMassachusetts  was  tied  in  any  way  to  Great  American's\n\ndecision to eliminate the older LeBlanc's position in eastern\n\nMassachusetts;  nothing suggests  they  were hired  to assume\n\nLeBlanc's   responsibilities.     LeBlanc   submits   that  a\n\nreasonable   juror   might   conclude  that   a   company  as\n\nsophisticated as Great American would not legitimately decide\n\nto  engage in a reduction  in force shortly  after adding ten\n\nnew  positions.   But to  reach any  such conclusion  on this\n\nrecord,  a  juror  would  have to  indulge  impermissibly  in\n\nunsupported speculation.

Prior  to  then, she  serviced\n\nagents only  in Connecticut and western  Massachusetts.  Even\n\nin  July 1991, and thereafter, Daley did not perform anything\n\nlike  all  of  LeBlanc's  former  duties.    Moreover,  while\n\nassigned to some (though not all) of LeBlanc's former  agents\n\nin eastern Massachusetts, she  continued to service agents in\n\nwestern  Massachusetts.     Thus,  at  most,  her   temporary\n\nassignment   included  performing  some  of  LeBlanc's  prior\n\nresponsibilities while  carrying on  duties of her  own never\n\nperformed  by him.    And even  this  partial performance  of\n\nLeBlanc's  duties lasted for only three months.  This did not\n\namount to replacing him.7 \n\n          LeBlanc next  disputes Great American's  claim that\n\nit was experiencing  financial difficulties in the  Northeast\n\nZone and in Massachusetts  in 1990.  LeBlanc opines  that the\n\n                    \n\n7.  Since  September 1991,  when  Daley  resigned from  Great\nAmerican,  Charles DeMartino has been the only AOR in eastern\nMassachusetts.\n\n                             -28-\n\nprimary method for determining  whether a particular state or\n\na branch  office  is  profitable  is  by  comparing  what  is\n\nreferred to  as the total  benchmark figure (\"TBM\")  with the\n\ntotal loss ratio (\"TOT\").  According to LeBlanc, when the TBM\n\nfigure  exceeds the  TOT figure,  it  reflects profitability.\n\nLeBlanc  asserts that  Great American's  Gross Accident  Year\n\nAnalysis  Report (\"GAYAR\")  showed that,  for the  years 1987\n\nthrough 1991, Massachusetts was the only state among the four\n\nlargest producing states in the Northeast  Zone8 consistently\n\nto have a TBM figure that exceeded its TOT figure.    \n\n          The GAYAR,  however, was  only one of  many records\n\nkept   by  Great   American  that   measured   the  company's\n\nprofitability  in the  Northeast Zone  and in  Massachusetts.\n\nThe  Effective Accident  Year Report  for Massachusetts,  for\n\ninstance, revealed that, in 1990, the TOT figure exceeded the\n\nTBM  figure  fifty  to  forty-three.9    This  was  a  strong\n\nindication of unprofitability in Massachusetts.  In addition,\n\nthe profit and loss statements for the various offices in the\n\nNortheast  Zone  revealed  that the  region  was experiencing\n\n                    \n\n8.  The other  three states  were New York,  New Jersey,  and\nConnecticut.\n\n9.  The  difference  between  the  GAYAR  and  the  Effective\nAccident Year Report is that the former measured loss  ratios\non  a  policy  year/accident  year  basis  while  the  latter\nmeasured  loss ratios on a calendar year basis.  According to\nRobert McGuigan, who was  a vice-president for Great American\nat the time of LeBlanc's discharge, executives would evaluate\nthe calendar  year loss ratios, not  the policy year/accident\nyear loss ratios, to assess profitability.\n\n                             -29-\n\nfinancial difficulties in 1990.   For instance, the Lancaster\n\nbranch office,  to  which the  eastern  Massachusetts  region\n\nreported, showed a calendar year underwriting loss in 1990 of\n\napproximately  $3.7  million; the  New  Jersey profit  center\n\nreported a calendar year underwriting loss in 1990 of roughly\n\n$4.5 million;  and the New  England profit center  suffered a\n\ncalendar year underwriting loss in 1990 of approximately $3.8\n\nmillion.   All told,  the Northeast Zone  incurred a calendar\n\nyear underwriting loss in 1990 of $11.8 million.10\n\n          Given  this  evidence   of  substantial   financial\n\ndifficulty,  we   can  find  no  triable   issue  over  Great\n\nAmerican's assertion that unprofitability concerns fueled its\n\ndecision to lay off LeBlanc and the others.  The question for\n\na jury would not be whether Great American's finances, viewed\n\nby one yardstick, might arguably be seen by someone else in a\n\nmore  optimistic light  than  did its  managers, but  whether\n\nthere was  evidence of profitable  performance sufficient  to\n\npermit  a  reasonable jury  to  infer  that Great  American's\n\nproffered pessimistic analysis     given as a reason  for the\n\nlayoffs     was a mere  pretense.  Viewing  all the financial\n\nevidence together, including the GAYAR  data, we think a jury\n\nwould lack any rational basis from this evidence to  conclude\n\n                    \n\n10.  This  loss  appears  to   be  particularly  severe  when\ncompared  to the  $111  thousand calendar  year  underwriting\nprofit that the Northeast Zone realized in 1989.\n\n                             -30-\n\nthat Great  American's assertions of financial  concern, as a\n\nbasis for the discharges, were a sham.\n\n          Finally,  LeBlanc argues  that further  evidence of\n\nthe pretextual  nature of  Great  American's explanation  for\n\nterminating  LeBlanc lies in the  fact that Al  Conte did not\n\nconsult  with Bruce  Rutherford,  the branch  manager of  the\n\nLancaster  office and  the person  to whom  LeBlanc reported,\n\nbefore he made  the final  decision to dismiss  LeBlanc.   In\n\naddition,  LeBlanc  asserts  that  Joseph  Klimas, the  vice-\n\npresident in charge of personnel for  the Northeast Zone, did\n\nnot learn about LeBlanc's  impending dismissal until one week\n\nbefore  it was  officially announced.   Although  Conte might\n\nhave  been  well served  to  consult these  people  before he\n\ndecided to discharge LeBlanc, we  are not persuaded that this\n\nevidence either undermines the justifications  given by Great\n\nAmerican for its  decision to dismiss  LeBlanc or shows  that\n\nGreat American or Conte  was motivated by age animus.

The  statistics themselves\n\nare  of questionable  import,  and  they  stand  precariously\n\nunsupported    by   other    probative   evidence    of   age\n\ndiscrimination.   There is, moreover, no  evidence whatsoever\n\nto  connect  the  statistics  to  Great  American's  specific\n\ndecision to dismiss LeBlanc.  \n\n          The flaws  in the statistical  evidence itself  are\n\nnotable.   First,  the comparison  of LeBlanc's age  with the\n\ndistribution  of  ages  in  various  groups of  AORs  in  the\n\nNortheast  Zone  from  1989  through 1991  fails  to  provide\n\nimportant information  regarding the pool of  applicants.

Indeed, the\n          \n\nfact that recently hired AORs are younger than LeBlanc is not\n\n                             -34-\n\nnecessarily evidence of discriminatory intent, but may simply\n\nreflect a younger available work force.  \n\n          Second, LeBlanc's statistics  that compare the ages\n\nof  the employees who left Great American for any reason from\n\n1989 through 1991  with the ages of  Great American employees\n\nwho kept  their jobs during  the period  fail to  distinguish\n\nvoluntary  from involuntary departures.  Voluntary departures\n\nobviously have  no bearing on whether  Great American engaged\n\nin age discrimination.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491507\"><a href=\"/opinion/491507/44-fair-emplpraccas-418-43-empl-prac-dec-p-37234-45-empl-prac/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> (improper to </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">include \"all who\n                               \n\nleft the company during the relevant  period even though they\n\nmight have  retired . . .  or accepted jobs elsewhere\").   In\n\naddition, of  the twenty-two  people who left  Great American\n\neither  voluntarily  or involuntarily  during  the three-year\n\nperiod, seventeen left in  1991, the year following LeBlanc's\n\ndismissal.  Significantly, the average age of those seventeen\n\npeople  was  actually younger  than  the average  age  of the\n\nemployees  who stayed with  Great American.13   We cannot see\n\nhow  the data  from  1991  demonstrate  any  pattern  of  age\n\ndiscrimination whatsoever.   Accordingly, if we disregard the\n\ndata  from  1991,  LeBlanc's  statistics  are  based  on  the\n\ndeparture of only five employees, including LeBlanc, over two\n\n                    \n\n13.  Even  when the  1990  hires and  the  trainees, who  are\npresumably younger in age  than other employees, are excluded\nfrom  the employee  pool  during the  three-year period,  the\nstatistical comparisons between jobs that were eliminated and\njobs  that  were  not eliminated  in  1991  do  not raise  an\ninference of age discrimination.\n\n                             -35-\n\nyears  from  an average  annual  employee  population in  the\n\nNortheast  Zone of approximately 215 people.  \"[S]uch a small\n\nstatistical sample  carries little  or no probative  force to\n\nshow discrimination.\"   Fallis v.
