Plaintiff-appellant   Andrew  Smith\n                     \n\nappeals  the  district court's  direction  of  a verdict  for\n\ndefendant-appellee,    Brian   Hitchcock,    on   appellant's\n\nintentional infliction  of  emotional  distress  claim.    We\n\nsummarily affirm.\n\n          In June 1990, Smith made an unauthorized entry upon\n\nthe property of  Hitchcock, a member of the Marblehead Police\n\nDepartment.   During the entry Smith  destroyed some property\n\nowned  by Hitchcock.   Hitchcock  pursued Smith and,  after a\n\nbrief struggle, apprehended him a short distance away.  Smith\n\ntestified   that,  after  being  apprehended  and  after  all\n\nresistance  had  ceased,  he  was  punched  in  the  face  by\n\nHitchcock five times.  Hitchcock, and other witnesses, denied\n\nthat any punching had occurred.\n\n          Smith asserted  three claims  at trial.   First, he\n\nalleged that his  federal civil rights, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n   1983,  had been  violated by  the  use of  excessive force\n\nduring  the  course of  his arrest.    Second, he  asserted a\n\ncommon law claim of  assault and battery.  Third,  he claimed\n\nthat Hitchcock had intentionally inflicted emotional distress\n\nupon  him.  All claims were predicated on the allegation that\n\nHitchcock had punched Smith after he had been apprehended.  \n\n          At  the close of  Smith's presentation of evidence,\n\nthe court  granted Hitchcock's motion for  a directed verdict\n\non the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n                             -2-\n\nThe jury subsequently  found for Hitchcock  on the other  two\n\nclaims.  Smith appeals only the directed verdict.  \n\n          To recover on a claim for intentional infliction of\n\nemotional  distress under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must\n\nshow \"a  defendant intended to inflict  emotional distress or\n\nknew  or should  have  known that  emotional  distress was  a\n\nlikely  consequence of  his conduct,  . .  . his  conduct was\n\nextreme and outrageous . . . and . . . his conduct caused the\n\nplaintiff severe  emotional distress.\"  Nancy  P. v. D'Amato,\n                                                            \n\n401  Mass. 516,  520, 517  N.E.2d 824,  827 (1988).   Smith's\n\nappeal fails for two reasons.\n\n          First, Smith did not present sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport  a  jury  verdict on  this  claim  since  he did  not\n\nintroduce  any evidence  that  he  suffered severe  emotional\n\ndistress  from the alleged punching.  Second, in light of the\n\njury  charge, the  verdicts  for Hitchcock  on the  excessive\n\nforce  and  assault  and  battery  claims  necessarily   were\n\npredicated on a finding  that no unreasonable force was  used\n\nby Hitchcock during the course of the arrest, in other words,\n\nthat Hitchcock's conduct was not \"so outrageous in character,\n\nand so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds\n\nof decency,  and to  be  regarded as  atrocious, and  utterly\n\nintolerable  in a  civilized community.\"   Foley  v. Polaroid\n                                                             \n\nCorp., 400 Mass. 82,  99, 508 N.E.2d 72, 82  (1987) (defining\n    \n\n\"extreme  and  outrageous\"   conduct)  (quoting   Restatement\n\n                             -3-\n\n(Second)  of Torts   46  comment d (1965)).   These verdicts,\n\ntherefore,  preclude a finding  of intentional  infliction of\n\nemotional distress and render  harmless any error which might\n\nhave occurred in the direction of the verdict for  Hitchcock.\n\nSee  Senra v.  Cunningham, 9  F.3d 168,  174 (1st  Cir. 1993)\n                         \n\n(jury  finding of  no  excessive force  precludes finding  of\n\nmalicious prosecution  and renders error in  directed verdict\n\nharmless); see also Dean v. Worcester, 924 F.2d 364, 369 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1991) (summary judgment required on claim of intentional\n\ninfliction  of  emotional  distress  where  summary  judgment\n\nappropriate  on claims  of  excessive force  and assault  and\n\nbattery).\n\n          Affirmed.
