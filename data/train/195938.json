Petitioner Anthony Simon appeals the denial\r                           \n\nby the  United  States District  Court  for the  District  of\n\nMassachusetts of his  motion to vacate, set  aside or correct\n\nhis sentence, pursuant  to 28 U.S.C.    2255.   We have  read\n\ncarefully  the  record in  this case  and  the briefs  of the\n\nparties.   We  affirm  the  decision of  the  district  court\n\nessentially for the reasons given in its memorandum and order\n\ndated August 25, 1993.  We add only the following.\n\n     Simon  claims that  the  record of  his  change of  plea\n\nhearing indicates  that the  district court violated  Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(c)(1)  because it failed to establish  that Simon\n\nentered his guilty plea with  an understanding of the \"nature\n\nof  the charge[s] to which the plea  [was] entered.\"  Id.  He\r                                                                    \n\nalso  claims  that the  court  failed  to make  a  sufficient\n\ninquiry to  \"satisfy it[self] that  there is a  factual basis\n\nfor the plea.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(f).  \n\n     A failure to ascertain  that Simon understood the charge\n\nto which  he was  pleading guilty  would  constitute a  \"core\n\nviolation\" of Rule 11 and mandate that the plea be set aside.\n\nUnited States  v. Cotal-Crespo,  No. 94-1354, slip  op. at  7\r                                          \n\n(1st Cir. Jan. 30,  1995).  \"[W]e review the  totality of the\n\ncircumstances  surrounding  the  Rule  11  hearing\"  and,  in\n\nparticular, \"the  substance of  what was communicated  by the\n\ntrial court, and what  should reasonably have been understood\r\r\n\nby the defendant, rather than the form of the communication.\"\n\nId.\r              \n\n     Simon pled  guilty to  one count  of possession  of more\n\nthan one hundred grams of heroin in violation of 21  U.S.C.  \n\n841(a)(1) and one count of  engaging in a continuing criminal\n\nenterprise in violation  of 21  U.S.C.   848.   Although  the\n\ncourt asked  Simon whether  he understood  the nature of  the\n\ncharges to which he was pleading guilty,  and Simon responded\n\nin  the affirmative,  the court  neither read the  charges to\n\nSimon nor explained  to him the  specific elements of  either\n\ncount.    However, the prosecutor's statement of the evidence\n\nwhich  would have  been  offered at  trial clearly  described\n\nfacts which set  forth all  the elements of  each offense  to\n\nwhich  Simon  pled guilty  and  the  conduct by  Simon  which\n\nconstituted  each  offense.     Simon   admitted  to   having\n\n\"participated  in the offenses charged  [in the two counts to\n\nwhich he pled guilty]  in the ways indicated in  that summary\n\nof  the evidence.\"    Since no   \"exceptional  circumstances\"\n\nexist which  indicate otherwise, see, e.g.,  United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nRuiz-Del  Valle, 8 F.3d  98, 103-04 (1st  Cir. 1993) (finding\r                           \n\nchange of  plea hearing defective because  charge was neither\n\nread  nor explained  and defendant  during plea  hearing made\r                                    \n\nstatement which should have  put court on notice she  did not\n\nunderstand charge),  the prosector's statement  is sufficient\n\nevidence  that  Simon  understood  the charges  to  which  he\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nentered a plea.  Cotal-Crespo, slip op. at 10.   It is also a\r                                         \n\nsufficient for finding that there was a factual basis for the\n\nplea.  See United States v.  Fountain, 777 F.2d 351, 355 (7th\r                                                 \n\nCir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1029 (1986).\r                                    \n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
