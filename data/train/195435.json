The Secretary  of\n                                         \n\nLabor  (\"the Secretary\")  brought this  retaliatory discharge\n\naction in the  United States District Court  for the District\n\nof   Massachusetts   pursuant  to   Section   11(c)  of   the\n\nOccupational Safety and  Health Act of 1970  (\"the OSH Act\"),\n\n29  U.S.C.   660(c).  The  Secretary's complaint alleged that\n\ndefendant-appellant      Cambridgeport      Air       Systems\n\n(\"Cambridgeport\")  violated  the  OSH  Act in  June  1989  by\n\ndischarging two employees, Peter Richardson and  Shawn Roche,\n\nbecause they had complained  about health and safety problems\n\nat    Cambridgeport's    Salisbury,   Massachusetts    plant.\n\nRichardson had  been employed by  the defendant as  a welder;\n\nRoche was a general shipper-trainee.\n\n          The  claim was tried by the court over five days in\n\nMay 1993.   In a  written opinion, the  district court  found\n\nthat  the  defendant-appellant   had  discharged   Richardson\n\nbecause  of  his protected  activities.    The court  awarded\n\nRichardson  back pay  and  then doubled  this  award, as  the\n\nSecretary had  requested, to   \"cover additional  damage plus\n\nprejudgment  interest.\"     The   total  amount   awarded  to\n\nRichardson was $104,968.\n\n          The court  found that Roche was  not discharged for\n\nhis  own protected activity.  Rather, the court found that he\n\nwas  terminated   because  \"he   was  a  special   friend  of\n\nRichardson's,\"  that  his  discharge  was  \"a  house-cleaning\n\n                             -3-\n\nproposition,\" and that he \"would not have been discharged but\n\nfor his  connection with  Richardson.\"  As  with Richardson's\n\naward, the court awarded  Roche an amount equal to  twice his\n\nlost back pay, a total of $88,552.\n\n          Cambridgeport appeals, and we affirm.  \n\n                              I.\n\n          Cambridgeport does  not  appeal from  the  district\n\ncourt's ruling that Richardson  was terminated because of his\n\nprotected activities.  Rather, Cambridgeport argues that  the\n\ndistrict court erred in  finding that Roche's termination was\n\nretaliatory, and in calculating the back pay damages for both\n\nRichardson  and  Roche.   As  both  determinations depend  on\n\nfindings  of fact,  we may  set them  aside only  if \"clearly\n\nerroneous.\"   Fed. R. Civ.  P. 52.   We are required  to give\n\n\"due  regard\" to the \"opportunity of the trial court to judge\n\nthe  credibility  of  the  witnesses.\"    Id.     Under  this\n                                             \n\ndeferential standard,  we  must  accept  a  district  court's\n\naccount  of the evidence if it is  \"plausible in light of the\n\nrecord  viewed in its  entirety . .  . . Where  there are two\n\npermissible views  of the  evidence, the  factfinder's choice\n\nbetween  them  cannot be  clearly  erroneous.\"   Anderson  v.\n                                                         \n\nBessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985).\n             \n\n                              A.\n\n                             -4-\n\n          Cambridgeport  contends  that Roche  was terminated\n\nfor  valid   work  reasons,   not  in  retaliation   for  his\n\nassociation with Richardson.  Roche admitted at trial that he\n\nhad  made mistakes at work and had been reprimanded.  Roche's\n\nsupervisors  also  testified  that his  work  performance was\n\npoor.  Cambridgeport  contends  that  the  only  evidence  in\n\nsupport of the court's explanation for Roche's discharge came\n\nfrom Roche  himself, whose testimony was  not deemed credible\n\nin other respects by the district court.1 \n\n          It is true that the district court was unwilling to\n\ncredit  Roche's testimony  that he  had joined  Richardson in\n\ncomplaining about  safety and  health matters.   Still, there\n\nwas sufficient  evidence to support the  court's finding that\n\nRoche  was   terminated  because   of  his   connection  with\n\nRichardson.   There  was evidence  that Roche  and Richardson\n\nwere particularly close friends and that management was aware\n\nof  this.  Roche's supervisor  had warned Roche  not to raise\n\nsafety concerns.   In addition, Roche's  termination followed\n\nless  than a week after  Richardson's, at a  time when Roche,\n\naccording to his testimony,  was sufficiently concerned about\n\nhis job security to bring a tape recorder to work.  Moreover,\n\nthe court was unimpressed by Cambridgeport's asserted reasons\n\nfor Roche's discharge.    Cambridgeport's witnesses, it said,\n\n                    \n\n1.  Cambridgeport concedes  that the  OSH Act  would prohibit\nRoche's termination if  in fact he was discharged  because of\nhis relationship with Richardson.  \n\n                             -5-\n\nhad \"greatly exaggerated\" their accounts  of Roche's problems\n\nat work.\n\n          Given its adverse assessment of the credibility  of\n\nCambridgeport's   witnesses,  and   the  close   and  visible\n\nconnection between Richardson and  Roche, the district  court\n\nfelt that  the most likely explanation  for Roche's discharge\n\nwas that Cambridgeport wanted to \"get rid of the smaller fry,\n\nand impress the other employees\" not to associate with health\n\nand  safety activists.  While not the only possible one, this\n\nview  of the evidence was  \"plausible in light  of the record\n\nviewed  in  its  entirety.\"    Anderson,  470  U.S.  at  574.\n                                       \n\nQuestions  of witness  credibility are  particularly  for the\n\ntrier to resolve.  United  States v. Olea, 987 F.2d  874, 876\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir.  1993).  We cannot  say the court clearly  erred in\n\nfinding that  Roche was discharged because  of his connection\n\nwith Richardson.\n\n                              B.\n\n          The parties stipulated that  the period of back pay\n\nat  issue was  from the  June 1989  dates of  discharge until\n\nDecember 12, 1991.  The district court calculated the damages\n\nfor  both employees  based on  the assumption  that, but  for\n\ntheir retaliatory discharges,  they both would have  retained\n\ntheir jobs for this entire period.  Cambridgeport argues that\n\nthis calculation  was clearly erroneous and  not supported by\n\nthe  evidence.    Cambridgeport  insists  that  its  work  is\n\n                             -6-\n\ncyclical, and  that given Richardson's lack  of general sheet\n\nmetal  workers' skills  and Roche's  poor work  history, both\n\nemployees would have been laid off long before December 1991.\n\n          Again,  the district  court's findings  depended in\n\nlarge   part  on   its  determination   that  Cambridgeport's\n\nwitnesses  lacked credibility.   The  district court  did not\n\nbelieve the Cambridgeport witnesses' assertions that the work\n\nfor  which Richardson had been  hired \"fell off,\"  nor did it\n\nbelieve that his work performance was unsatisfactory.  In the\n\ncourt's  view,  the  defendant's  reasons  for  limiting  its\n\nliability  vis-a-vis  Richardson  were  \"likely  trumped up.\"\n\nThere was  evidence that  Richardson's ability and  character\n\nwere, overall, in the words of the court, \"satisfactory,\" and\n\nthat  less than a week after his discharge, the company hired\n\na new employee to do the exact work that Richardson  had been\n\ndoing.  Moreover, there was evidence that Richardson could do\n\nnon-welding work and could have been transferred to such work\n\nif the \"pure welding\" work \"fell off.\"  \n\n          There was  also sufficient  evidence in the  record\n\nfor the  court to disbelieve Cambridgeport's  contention that\n\nRoche  would  have been  laid off  soon  after June  1989 \"in\n\naccord  with  the  cyclical  swings of  employment,  and  not\n\nrehired.\"  Cambridgeport placed an advertisement in the local\n\nnewspaper for \"shop laborers\" on the day Roche was discharged\n\n                             -7-\n\nand subsequently hired workers  in the department where Roche\n\nworked.\n\n          On reading the record as a whole, we cannot say the\n\ncourt's  view of the evidence  was implausible.   It was not,\n\ntherefore,  clear  error  for  the  court  to  calculate  the\n\nemployees' back pay award on the basis of an assumption that,\n\nbut for  their retaliatory  discharges, they both  would have\n\nretained their jobs for the entire stipulated period.  \n\n                             II.\n\n          The Secretary  advanced the view at  trial that the\n\nappropriate  measure of  damages  for both  employees was  an\n\namount equal to twice  their back pay losses.   The Secretary\n\nargued to  the district court  that doubling back  pay losses\n\nwould  not be a penalty, but would serve \"to compensate[] for\n\nthe effects of loss of pay upon the victim[s].\"\n           \n\n          The  court  adopted  the  Secretary's   measure  of\n\ndamages, saying  that \"the conduct of this defendant, both in\n\nand out of court,  is so consistently brash that  [the court]\n\nfeels justified in finding doubling the lost wages award, but\n\nto  serve   to  cover  additional  damage   plus  prejudgment\n\ninterest.\"   The  court later supported  its doubling  of the\n\naward  by  \"calling  for  special support  of  the  statutory\n\npurpose  when  an employer  flaunts it  both  by word  and by\n\nopenly unambiguous conduct.\"\n\n                             -8-\n\n          Cambridgeport  argues  that doubling  the  back pay\n\naward  amounted  to  an  award  of  punitive,  or  exemplary,\n\ndamages, and was  unauthorized by  the OSH Act.   It  insists\n\nthat courts interpreting  the statute have  uniformly limited\n\nrecovery  in  cases of  retaliatory  discharge  to back  pay,\n\nemployment   search   expenses,   and  in   some   instances,\n\nprejudgment   interest.      The   Secretary   contests   the\n\ncharacterization of the award as  exemplary.  He argues  that\n\nthe  court's statement  that  double wages  served \"to  cover\n\nadditional  damage  plus   prejudgment  interest\"  shows   an\n\nintention to grant compensatory  damages, and that the record\n\nsupports the  award on  that basis.   The  Secretary concedes\n\nthat  this is the first reported case in which double damages\n\nhave been awarded under the OSH Act.  But he insists that the\n\ncase  also  represents  the  first  time  the  Secretary  has\n\nactually asked for such damages.\n              \n\n                              A.\n\n          The  question  of whether  the  district court  was\n\nwithin  its authority  to authorize  double back  pay damages\n\nturns on an interpretation  of Section 11(c) of the  OSH Act,\n\n29 U.S.C.    660(c).  This  is a question of  law, subject to\n\nour review de novo.  United States v. Jones, 10 F.3d 901, 904\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          The relevant provision reads:\n\n          Any employee  who believes  that  he has  been\n          discharged or  otherwise discriminated against\n\n                             -9-\n\n          by any person in violation  of this subsection\n          may . . . file a complaint with  the Secretary\n          alleging such discrimination. . . .  If [after\n          appropriate]   investigation,   the  Secretary\n          determines   that   the  provisions   of  this\n          subsection have been violated, he  shall bring\n          an  action  in any  appropriate  United States\n          district court against  such person.   In  any\n          such action the United States  district courts\n          shall  have jurisdiction,  for cause  shown to\n          restrain  violations  .  .  .  and  order  all\n                                                        \n          appropriate   relief  including   rehiring  or\n                              \n          reinstatement  of the  employee to  his former\n          position with back pay.\n\n29  U.S.C.    660(c)(2)  (emphasis  added).   We  must decide\n\nwhether  the district  court's awarding  of damages  equal to\n\ntwice the  employees' lost back pay  was \"appropriate relief\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the statute and  under the facts of the\n\ncase.  \n\n          The Secretary  urges that  we interpret    11(c) in\n\nthe  light of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Sch., 112 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt.  1028, 1032 (1992).  In Franklin, the Supreme Court ruled\n                                    \n\nthat  federal courts  may award  monetary damages  in private\n\nactions  brought  to  enforce   Title  IX  of  the  Education\n\nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C.    1681-1688 (\"Title IX\").  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat 1038.   Congress did  not explicitly  provide for  private\n\nactions  in Title  IX; however,  the right  to  bring private\n\nactions was  earlier  \"implied\" by  the  Court in  Cannon  v.\n                                                         \n\nUniversity of Chicago, 441  U.S. 677 (1979).  Even  absent an\n                     \n\nexpress  right  to  sue, monetary  damages  were  held to  be\n\navailable because  the Court \"presume[s] the  availability of\n\nall  appropriate  remedies   unless  Congress  has  expressly\n\n                             -10-\n\nindicated otherwise.\"   Franklin, 112  S. Ct. at  1032.   The\n                                \n\nCourt  announced \"[t]he general  rule . . . that absent clear\n                                                             \n\ndirection  to the  contrary by  Congress, the  federal courts\n                           \n\nhave  the  power  to  award  any  appropriate  relief  in   a\n\ncognizable  cause of  action  brought pursuant  to a  federal\n\nstatute.\"  Id. at 1035 (emphasis added).\n              \n\n          The instant  case differs from Franklin  in that we\n                                                 \n\nare here  construing Congress's meaning when,  in creating an\n                               \n\nexpress  cause of  action  for  the  Secretary  of  Labor  to\n\ninstitute  on behalf  of an  aggrieved employee,  it licensed\n\ncourts  to \"order all appropriate relief.\"  In Franklin, \"all\n                                                       \n\nappropriate remedies\" were the Court's words, not Congress's.\n\nNonetheless,  the parallel  is unmistakable.   It is  hard to\n\nbelieve that  the Supreme  Court     having presumed  that an\n\nimplied  private  right of  action included  \"all appropriate\n\nremedies\"  or \"any appropriate  relief,\" and having construed\n\nremedies so described to  include \"monetary damages\" and \"any\n\nof   the    procedures   or   actions    normally   available\n\n. . . according to  the exigencies  of the particular  case,\"\n\n112  S.  Ct.  at  1034      would  construe  less  generously\n\nCongress's  similar phrase,  \"all  appropriate  relief.\"   We\n\nthink   Franklin  strongly  suggests  that  \"all  appropriate\n                \n\nrelief\" as  written in    11(c) embraces monetary  damages as\n\nwell as  other relevant  forms of relief  normally available,\n\n                             -11-\n\nCongress  having  provided   no  \"clear  direction\"  to   the\n\ncontrary.  See 112 S. Ct. at 1035.\n              \n\n          Cambridgeport, nonetheless, would have us find here\n\n\"clear  direction to  the contrary\"  because the  phrase \"all\n\nappropriate  relief\" is  succeeded by  the  words, \"including\n\nrehiring  or  reinstatement of  the  employee  to his  former\n\nposition  with back  pay.\"   This,  we  are told,  evinces  a\n\nCongressional  intent  to  limit  relief  to  those  remedies\n\nexpressly  mentioned, or  at least  to the kinds  of remedies\n                                                \n\nmentioned.   Cambridgeport  contends  that given  the express\n\ndelineation of  certain  remedies,  \"[t]here  is  nothing  to\n\nsuggest that  Congress affirmatively intended [] an expansive\n\ninterpretation\"  of    11(c),  and  that  double damages  are\n\ntherefore unauthorized under the OSH Act.\n\n          However, the key language of the OSH Act  is broad.\n\nIt authorizes a court to \"order all appropriate relief.\"  The\n\nfurther   language   including    certain   remedies,    like\n                              \n\nreinstatement,  indicates  the   availability  of  the  named\n\nremedies,  but does  not  purport to  limit \"all  appropriate\n\nrelief\" to those remedies  only.  The mere naming  of certain\n\nincluded remedies neither suggests nor is a \"clear direction\"\n\nthat  other remedies are precluded.  See Franklin, 112 S. Ct.\n                                                 \n\nat 1035; Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v.

Moreover, given the expansive\n                             \n\nlanguage in  Franklin (\"[t]he general rule  . . . that absent\n                     \n\nclear  direction to  the  contrary by  Congress, the  federal\n\ncourts  have the power to  award any appropriate  relief in a\n\ncognizable  cause of  action  brought pursuant  to a  federal\n\nstatute,\"   112 S. Ct.  at 1035), it  is difficult to exclude\n\neven  exemplary   damages   where  otherwise   justified   in\n               \n\nparticular circumstances.

Under the  broad and unequivocal\n\nlanguage  in Franklin,  however, the  absence of  an explicit\n                                             \n\nmention in the OSH Act would not seem enough to take from the\n\ncourts  their \"'\"power to  utilize any  of the  procedures or\n\nactions normally available  . . . according to the exigencies\n\nof  the particular  case.\"'\"   Franklin, 112  S.

Section 10(c) of the NLRA authorizes the\n\nNational Labor Relations Board to  investigate allegations of\n\nunfair labor practices and,  if the allegations are found  to\n\nbe  true,   to  order  \"such   affirmative  action  including\n                                                  \n\nreinstatement  of employees with or without back pay, as will\n\neffectuate  the  policies\"  of the  Act.    29  U.S.C.    160\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          Similarly,   706(g) of  Title VII authorizes courts\n\nhearing  a  complaint   of  discrimination  to  \"order   such\n                                                             \n\naffirmative action as may  be appropriate, which may include,\n                  \n\nbut is not limited to, reinstatement or  hiring of employees,\n\nwith or without back pay .  . . or any other equitable relief\n\nas  the  court  deems  appropriate.\"   42  U.S.C.     2000e-5\n\n(emphasis added).

The\n\npenalties  in the  House  version of  the  OSH Act  had  been\n\ndifferent and stronger than those in the Senate version.

The\n\nconference report says nothing about an intent to broaden the\n\nSenate's remedies.   Nonetheless,  there is a  significant   \n\n                             -19-\n\nand obvious     distinction between  the right  to order  the\n\noffender  \"to  take  such  affirmative action  to  abate  the\n\nviolation  as  the  Secretary  deems  appropriate,  including\n\n. . .\"  and authorizing  a  court \"to  order all  appropriate\n\nrelief, including . . . .\"   The final bill was a  product of\n\ncompromise      the Senate  allowed  the  Secretary to  bring\n\ncauses of action in the district courts; the House gave up on\n\ncriminal penalties.  In  this atmosphere of \"substantial give\n\nand  take,\" see 116 Cong. Rec. 42,200 (1970) (remarks of Rep.\n               \n\nPerkins),  reprinted in  Legislative History  at 1200,  it is\n                                            \n\nhardly obvious,  where different language was  used, that the\n\nconference committee desired merely  to transfer to a federal\n\ncourt the exact same set  of remedies the Senate gave  to the\n\nSecretary  of Labor in its earlier version.  Indeed, it would\n\nseem  inconsistent to assume, on the  one hand, that Congress\n\nintends to incorporate an entire remedial scheme when it uses\n\na term of art in a statute, see, e.g., Richerson, 551 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n927, but to  assume that,  on the other  hand, when  Congress\n\nomits  the term of art and adopts different language, that it\n\ndid so inadvertently.\n\n          Choice of the  terminology \"all appropriate relief\"\n\nsuggests that Congress  might have been  looking more to  the\n\nlanguage of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act\n\nof 1959, which outlines a \"bill of rights\" for union members,\n\n29  U.S.C.   411(a), and  provides that actions for violation\n\n                             -20-\n\nof those rights may be had to recover \"such relief (including\n\ninjunctions) as  may be appropriate.\"   29 U.S.C.    412.

That authority  would be broad enough  to\n\nsupport  an award  of twice  the employees' pay  provided the\n\nfacts and circumstances of this case  justified such an award\n\n                    \n\n4.  Cf.  Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act,  20\n       \nU.S.C.     1401-1485, which  requires participating state and\nlocal  educational    agencies \"to  assure  that  handicapped\nchildren  and  their  parents  or  guardians  are  guaranteed\nprocedural safeguards  with respect to the  provision of free\nappropriate public  education\" to such  handicapped children.\n20  U.S.C.    1415(a). This  procedural framework  offers the\nparents an opportunity  to contest any  decision made by  the\nstate  regarding the  child's identification,  evaluation, or\neducational  placement   through  appropriate  administrative\nprocedures  and, if necessary, in state or federal court.  In\nsuch civil actions, the court \"shall grant such relief as the\ncourt determines is appropriate.\"  20 U.S.C.   1415(e)(2).\n     Courts have split  in determining  whether this  statute\nallows  for punitive damages.

There  was evidence that  both Richardson\n\nand  Roche   incurred  monetary   losses  because   of  their\n\ndischarges  in addition to their lost back pay.  The district\n\ncourt stated that a portion of the award  covered prejudgment\n\ninterest, which, depending on the interest rate chosen by the\n\ncourt, could itself amount to more than 35% of the back wages\n\nowed.\n\n          In   addition,   the  court   concluded   that  the\n\ndefendant's  conduct,  \"both  in  and  out  of  court,  [was]\n\nconsistently  brash,\"  suggesting  a  belief  that  exemplary\n\ndamages were in  order.  The  court found that  Cambridgeport\n\nhad intentionally retaliated against Richardson and had fired\n\nRoche as an example to other employees.  The court also noted\n\nthat  its \"general picture\" of  the defendant was informed by\n\n                             -23-\n\nthe  testimony  of   a  Labor  Department  investigator   who\n\ntestified  that, during the  Secretary's investigation of the\n\nemployees' termination, a  member of Cambridgeport management\n\nhad offered the investigator  a case of wine, possibly  in an\n\nattempt to influence the  investigation.  Moreover, the court\n\nfound that Cambridgeport during  trial had revealed itself as\n\n\"a  tough  outfit\" that  \"more  than  passively observed;  it\n\nsupervised  its witnesses.\"   Given  these findings,  and the\n\nconduct of the defendant as assessed by the court,  the court\n\ndid not exceed  its discretion  in awarding  double back  pay\n\ndamages.\n\n          Affirmed.

The  Secretary's complaint alleged that\n\ndefendant-appellant      Cambridgeport      Air       Systems\n\n(\"Cambridgeport\")  violated  the  OSH  Act in  June  1989  by\n\ndischarging two employees, Peter Richardson and  Shawn Roche,\n\nbecause they had complained  about health and safety problems\n\nat    Cambridgeport's    Salisbury,   Massachusetts    plant.\n\nRichardson had  been employed by  the defendant as  a welder;\n\nRoche was a general shipper-trainee.\n\n          The  claim was tried by the court over five days in\n\nMay 1993.   In a  written opinion, the  district court  found\n\nthat  the  defendant-appellant   had  discharged   Richardson\n\nbecause  of  his protected  activities.    The court  awarded\n\nRichardson  back pay  and  then doubled  this  award, as  the\n\nSecretary had  requested, to   \"cover additional  damage plus\n\nprejudgment  interest.\"     The   total  amount   awarded  to\n\nRichardson was $104,968.\n\n          The court  found that Roche was  not discharged for\n\nhis  own protected activity.  Rather, the court found that he\n\nwas  terminated   because  \"he   was  a  special   friend  of\n\nRichardson's,\"  that  his  discharge  was  \"a  house-cleaning\n\n                             -3-\n\nproposition,\" and that he \"would not have been discharged but\n\nfor his  connection with  Richardson.\"  As  with Richardson's\n\naward, the court awarded  Roche an amount equal to  twice his\n\nlost back pay, a total of $88,552.\n\n          Cambridgeport appeals, and we affirm.  \n\n                              I.\n\n          Cambridgeport does  not  appeal from  the  district\n\ncourt's ruling that Richardson  was terminated because of his\n\nprotected activities.  Rather, Cambridgeport argues that  the\n\ndistrict court erred in  finding that Roche's termination was\n\nretaliatory, and in calculating the back pay damages for both\n\nRichardson  and  Roche.   As  both  determinations depend  on\n\nfindings  of fact,  we may  set them  aside only  if \"clearly\n\nerroneous.\"   Fed. R. Civ.  P. 52.

Roche admitted at trial that he\n\nhad  made mistakes at work and had been reprimanded.  Roche's\n\nsupervisors  also  testified  that his  work  performance was\n\npoor.  Cambridgeport  contends  that  the  only  evidence  in\n\nsupport of the court's explanation for Roche's discharge came\n\nfrom Roche  himself, whose testimony was  not deemed credible\n\nin other respects by the district court.1 \n\n          It is true that the district court was unwilling to\n\ncredit  Roche's testimony  that he  had joined  Richardson in\n\ncomplaining about  safety and  health matters.   Still, there\n\nwas sufficient  evidence to support the  court's finding that\n\nRoche  was   terminated  because   of  his   connection  with\n\nRichardson.   There  was evidence  that Roche  and Richardson\n\nwere particularly close friends and that management was aware\n\nof  this.  Roche's supervisor  had warned Roche  not to raise\n\nsafety concerns.   In addition, Roche's  termination followed\n\nless  than a week after  Richardson's, at a  time when Roche,\n\naccording to his testimony,  was sufficiently concerned about\n\nhis job security to bring a tape recorder to work.  Moreover,\n\nthe court was unimpressed by Cambridgeport's asserted reasons\n\nfor Roche's discharge.    Cambridgeport's witnesses, it said,\n\n                    \n\n1.  Cambridgeport concedes  that the  OSH Act  would prohibit\nRoche's termination if  in fact he was discharged  because of\nhis relationship with Richardson.  \n\n                             -5-\n\nhad \"greatly exaggerated\" their accounts  of Roche's problems\n\nat work.\n\n          Given its adverse assessment of the credibility  of\n\nCambridgeport's   witnesses,  and   the  close   and  visible\n\nconnection between Richardson and  Roche, the district  court\n\nfelt that  the most likely explanation  for Roche's discharge\n\nwas that Cambridgeport wanted to \"get rid of the smaller fry,\n\nand impress the other employees\" not to associate with health\n\nand  safety activists.

We cannot  say the court clearly  erred in\n\nfinding that  Roche was discharged because  of his connection\n\nwith Richardson.\n\n                              B.\n\n          The parties stipulated that  the period of back pay\n\nat  issue was  from the  June 1989  dates of  discharge until\n\nDecember 12, 1991.  The district court calculated the damages\n\nfor  both employees  based on  the assumption  that, but  for\n\ntheir retaliatory discharges,  they both would have  retained\n\ntheir jobs for this entire period.  Cambridgeport argues that\n\nthis calculation  was clearly erroneous and  not supported by\n\nthe  evidence.    Cambridgeport  insists  that  its  work  is\n\n                             -6-\n\ncyclical, and  that given Richardson's lack  of general sheet\n\nmetal  workers' skills  and Roche's  poor work  history, both\n\nemployees would have been laid off long before December 1991.\n\n          Again,  the district  court's findings  depended in\n\nlarge   part  on   its  determination   that  Cambridgeport's\n\nwitnesses  lacked credibility.   The  district court  did not\n\nbelieve the Cambridgeport witnesses' assertions that the work\n\nfor  which Richardson had been  hired \"fell off,\"  nor did it\n\nbelieve that his work performance was unsatisfactory.  In the\n\ncourt's  view,  the  defendant's  reasons  for  limiting  its\n\nliability  vis-a-vis  Richardson  were  \"likely  trumped up.\"\n\nThere was  evidence that  Richardson's ability and  character\n\nwere, overall, in the words of the court, \"satisfactory,\" and\n\nthat  less than a week after his discharge, the company hired\n\na new employee to do the exact work that Richardson  had been\n\ndoing.  Moreover, there was evidence that Richardson could do\n\nnon-welding work and could have been transferred to such work\n\nif the \"pure welding\" work \"fell off.\"  \n\n          There was  also sufficient  evidence in the  record\n\nfor the  court to disbelieve Cambridgeport's  contention that\n\nRoche  would  have been  laid off  soon  after June  1989 \"in\n\naccord  with  the  cyclical  swings of  employment,  and  not\n\nrehired.\"  Cambridgeport placed an advertisement in the local\n\nnewspaper for \"shop laborers\" on the day Roche was discharged\n\n                             -7-\n\nand subsequently hired workers  in the department where Roche\n\nworked.\n\n          On reading the record as a whole, we cannot say the\n\ncourt's  view of the evidence  was implausible.   It was not,\n\ntherefore,  clear  error  for  the  court  to  calculate  the\n\nemployees' back pay award on the basis of an assumption that,\n\nbut for  their retaliatory  discharges, they both  would have\n\nretained their jobs for the entire stipulated period.  \n\n                             II.\n\n          The Secretary  advanced the view at  trial that the\n\nappropriate  measure of  damages  for both  employees was  an\n\namount equal to twice  their back pay losses.   The Secretary\n\nargued to  the district court  that doubling back  pay losses\n\nwould  not be a penalty, but would serve \"to compensate[] for\n\nthe effects of loss of pay upon the victim[s].\"\n           \n\n          The  court  adopted  the  Secretary's   measure  of\n\ndamages, saying  that \"the conduct of this defendant, both in\n\nand out of court,  is so consistently brash that  [the court]\n\nfeels justified in finding doubling the lost wages award, but\n\nto  serve   to  cover  additional  damage   plus  prejudgment\n\ninterest.\"   The  court later supported  its doubling  of the\n\naward  by  \"calling  for  special support  of  the  statutory\n\npurpose  when  an employer  flaunts it  both  by word  and by\n\nopenly unambiguous conduct.\"\n\n                             -8-\n\n          Cambridgeport  argues  that doubling  the  back pay\n\naward  amounted  to  an  award  of  punitive,  or  exemplary,\n\ndamages, and was  unauthorized by  the OSH Act.   It  insists\n\nthat courts interpreting  the statute have  uniformly limited\n\nrecovery  in  cases of  retaliatory  discharge  to back  pay,\n\nemployment   search   expenses,   and  in   some   instances,\n\nprejudgment   interest.      The   Secretary   contests   the\n\ncharacterization of the award as  exemplary.  He argues  that\n\nthe  court's statement  that  double wages  served \"to  cover\n\nadditional  damage  plus   prejudgment  interest\"  shows   an\n\nintention to grant compensatory  damages, and that the record\n\nsupports the  award on  that basis.   The  Secretary concedes\n\nthat  this is the first reported case in which double damages\n\nhave been awarded under the OSH Act.  But he insists that the\n\ncase  also  represents  the  first  time  the  Secretary  has\n\nactually asked for such damages.\n              \n\n                              A.\n\n          The  question  of whether  the  district court  was\n\nwithin  its authority  to authorize  double back  pay damages\n\nturns on an interpretation  of Section 11(c) of the  OSH Act,\n\n29 U.S.C.    660(c).

The\n\nconference report says nothing about an intent to broaden the\n\nSenate's remedies.   Nonetheless,  there is a  significant   \n\n                             -19-\n\nand obvious     distinction between  the right  to order  the\n\noffender  \"to  take  such  affirmative action  to  abate  the\n\nviolation  as  the  Secretary  deems  appropriate,  including\n\n. . .\"  and authorizing  a  court \"to  order all  appropriate\n\nrelief, including . . . .\"   The final bill was a  product of\n\ncompromise      the Senate  allowed  the  Secretary to  bring\n\ncauses of action in the district courts; the House gave up on\n\ncriminal penalties.

There  was evidence that  both Richardson\n\nand  Roche   incurred  monetary   losses  because   of  their\n\ndischarges  in addition to their lost back pay.  The district\n\ncourt stated that a portion of the award  covered prejudgment\n\ninterest, which, depending on the interest rate chosen by the\n\ncourt, could itself amount to more than 35% of the back wages\n\nowed.\n\n          In   addition,   the  court   concluded   that  the\n\ndefendant's  conduct,  \"both  in  and  out  of  court,  [was]\n\nconsistently  brash,\"  suggesting  a  belief  that  exemplary\n\ndamages were in  order.  The  court found that  Cambridgeport\n\nhad intentionally retaliated against Richardson and had fired\n\nRoche as an example to other employees.  The court also noted\n\nthat  its \"general picture\" of  the defendant was informed by\n\n                             -23-\n\nthe  testimony  of   a  Labor  Department  investigator   who\n\ntestified  that, during the  Secretary's investigation of the\n\nemployees' termination, a  member of Cambridgeport management\n\nhad offered the investigator  a case of wine, possibly  in an\n\nattempt to influence the  investigation.  Moreover, the court\n\nfound that Cambridgeport during  trial had revealed itself as\n\n\"a  tough  outfit\" that  \"more  than  passively observed;  it\n\nsupervised  its witnesses.\"   Given  these findings,  and the\n\nconduct of the defendant as assessed by the court,  the court\n\ndid not exceed  its discretion  in awarding  double back  pay\n\ndamages.\n\n          Affirmed.
