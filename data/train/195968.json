Commonwealth v. Genius, (Genius I),\r                                                                       \n\n387  Mass.  695  (1982),  442 N.E.2d  1157;  Commonwealth  v.\r                                                                     \n\nGenius,  (Genius II), 402 Mass. 711  (1988), 524 N.E.2d 1349.\r                               \n\nHe  now appeals  from a  district court  order, backed  by an\n\nextensive opinion, denying  his petition  for habeas  corpus.\n\nThe facts are fully set forth by the Massachusetts Court and,\n\nagain,  by the  district  court.    We  deal  with  only  one\n\ncontention,  that  the  district  court  erred  in  rejecting\n\ndefendant's claim that he  was denied effective assistance of\n\ncounsel in that counsel did not pursue the defense of lack of\n\ncriminal responsibility (insanity).  We reverse.\n\n          Defendant  killed  his  girlfriend  with  ten  stab\n\nwounds.   The  Commonwealth charged  premeditation  and  also\n\nextreme atrocity, both of  which could lead to murder  in the\n\nfirst degree.  Defendant claimed that the victim turned a gun\n\non  him  and  that he  remembered  nothing  else.   A  court-\n\nappointed  psychiatrist,  a  Doctor  Koson,   testified  that\n\ndefendant   was  mentally   deficient,  but   not  criminally\n\nirresponsible.    Defendant's  counsel  accepted this.    The\n\npresent   proceeding  is  based   upon  defendant's  recently\n\nobtained psychiatric  report from  a Doctor Weiss  that would\n\nsupport  an insanity  defense.   The Superior  Court, \"deeply\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nconcerned,\" granted a pro  se motion for new  trial following\n\nGenius I,  but was reversed in  Genius II.   This petition is\r                                                     \n\nthe next step.1\n\n          Turning  to the  merits  of the  original case,  in\n\nDoctor Koson's opinion defendant was  not insane, and did not\n\nhave  a mental  defect,  but his  mentality was  sufficiently\n\ndiminished at the time  as to detract,  if the jury saw  fit,\n\nfrom  the extreme atrocity  that would make  for first degree\n\nmurder in the absence  of proof of premeditation.   Defendant\n\nsays  he  had   nothing  to  lose   by  having  an   insanity\n\nexamination.   Admittedly,  the Commonwealth would  have been\n\nrequired  to pay  for it,  M.G.L. c.  261,   27C(4),  and the\n\nreport  would have  been  privileged and  unavailable to  it.\n\nM.G.L.  c. 233,    20B.   If the  report proved  affirmative,\n\ndefendant was ahead.  If it proved negative, he need  not use\n\nit.\n\n          The  district  court  responded  to  this  with the\n\ngeneralization that preparation  is always in  the discretion\n\nof counsel, who cannot  be faulted for not  going on and  on,\n\nunless there was an indication that there might be a benefit.\n\nBut there  may have been  one.  Cf.  Profitt v. Waldron,  831\r                                                                   \n\nF.2d  1245, (5th  Cir.  1987).   In  Profitt the  court  held\r                                                        \n\ncounsel incompetent for ignoring  the fact that defendant had\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  There  is  no  question   of  failure  to  exhaust  state\nremedies.\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nbeen  in a mental institution.   Here defendant  did not have\n\nthat history, but he  did have something of consequence.   To\n\nmeet  the  fear that  he was  not  competent to  stand trial,\n\ndefendant  had  been sent  to  Bridgewater and  the  fear was\n\nconfirmed  on February  20.    It  was  not  until  May  that\n\ncompetency  was found.  While incompetency  to stand trial is\n\nnot  equivalent to insanity, it  is a serious condition, that\n\nshould have  flagged the  possibility.  Where  insanity would\n\nhave  been a  complete  defense, it  was  inexcusable not  to\n\npursue it.\n\n          Unless, of course,  there was a reason.   In Genius\r                                                                         \n\nI, the court said,\r             \n\n          We  conclude that  this was  a reasonable\n          tactical    choice    considering    that\n          defendant's own expert testified that the\n          defendant  was criminally  responsible on\n          May 29,  1979.  To argue  against his own\n          witness   on   the   issue  of   criminal\n          responsibility  would well  have undercut\n          his expert's credibility on  the Gould[2]\r                                                            \n          issues.  In the circumstances we find  no\n          ineffective  assistance   of  counsel  in\n          counsel's  failure  to   argue  lack   of\n          criminal responsibility.\n\n387 Mass. at  697.  We disagree.  To  forego even exploring a\n\npossible complete defense because  offering it might weaken a\n\npartial one  (reducing  murder one  to murder  two) seems  an\n\nextraordinarily unbalanced choice.   Whether counsel made  it\n\ndeliberately  (as  to  which there  was  no  evidence) or  by\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Commonwealth v.

And  particularly so when  there already was\n\nsome evidence of insanity in the record.

But there may have been one.  Cf. Profitt v. Waldron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496597\"><a href=\"/opinion/496597/gary-leroy-profitt-v-george-r-waldron-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span>, (5th Cir.1987).  In Profitt the court held counsel incompetent for ignoring the fact that defendant had been in a mental institution.  Here defendant did not have that history, but he did have something of consequence.  To meet the fear that he was not competent to stand trial, defendant had been sent to Bridgewater and the fear was confirmed on February 20.  It was not until May that competency was found.  While incompetency to stand trial is not equivalent to insanity, it is a serious condition, that should have flagged the possibility.  Where insanity would have been a complete defense, it was inexcusable not to pursue it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unless, of course, there was a reason.

To argue against his own witness on the issue of criminal responsibility would well have undercut his expert's credibility on the Gould<sup></sup><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a><sup></sup> issues.  In the circumstances we find no ineffective assistance of counsel in counsel's failure to argue lack of criminal responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">387 Mass. at 697, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2056361\"><a href=\"/opinion/2056361/commonwealth-v-genius/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span>.   We disagree.  To forego even exploring a possible complete defense because offering it might weaken a partial one (reducing murder one to murder two) seems an extraordinarily unbalanced choice.  Whether counsel made it deliberately (as to which there was no evidence) or by default, we cannot find it within the most tolerant standard of competence.  And particularly so when there already was some evidence of insanity in the record.
