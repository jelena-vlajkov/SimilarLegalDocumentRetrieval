The sole issue raised by this appeal\r                                \n\nis  whether the district  court erred, on  remand, in denying\n\ndefendant-appellant Clifford K. Tapia an additional one-level\n\nreduction in  his offense level under  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1(b)(1)\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n          On  September  28,  1993,   Tapia  pled  guilty  to\n\npossession  of heroin with  intent to  distribute it,  see 18\r                                                                      \n\nU.S.C.   841(a)(1); being a felon in possession of a firearm,\n\nsee 18 U.S.C.    922(g); and possession of a  firearm with an\r               \n\naltered serial number, see  18 U.S.C.   922(k).   On November\r                                      \n\n24, 1993, the district court sentenced Tapia to a prison term\n\nof  forty-one months.   Tapia  appealed, contending  that the\n\ndistrict court, which granted him a two-level reduction under\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1(a)  for acceptance of responsibility,  erred\n\nin  failing  to   consider  whether  he  is  entitled  to  an\n\nadditional one-level reduction for having  \"timely provid[ed]\n\ncomplete information  to the  government  concerning his  own\n\ninvolvement in the  offense.\"   U.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b)(1).   On\n\nJune  9, 1994, we  vacated Tapia's sentence  and remanded the\n\ncase to the district court so that it could determine whether\n\nTapia  is eligible for the extra reduction.  United States v.\r                                                                      \n\nClifford K. Tapia, No. 93-2306, slip op. at 6  (1st Cir. June\r                             \n\n9, 1994).  \r\r\n\n          Following a hearing  on remand, the district  court\n\ndenied Tapia's request for the additional one-level decrease.\n\nIn support of its  determination, the district court observed\n\nthat \"there is really  nothing in the record to  suggest that\n\nthe  [d]efendant in  fact  gave complete  information to  the\n\n[g]overnment, nothing at all.\"  The court also  observed that\n\nthe government, acting  pursuant to a plea agreement, took no\n\nposition  on the issue.   Under the  circumstances, the court\n\nconcluded that  it was \"virtually impossible for [it] to find\n\nthat   the  [d]efendant   meets   the  requirements   of   [ \n\n3E1.1(b)(1)].\"  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n\n          Contrary  to Tapia's  suggestion, we  do not  think\n\nthat the district court ruled  against him simply because the\n\ngovernment took no position on his eligibility for  the extra\n\nreduction.    The court's  questions  during  the hearing  on\n\nremand indicate that it had serious doubts whether Tapia ever\n\nprovided  complete information  to  the government.   It  was\n\nTapia's burden  to prove  that he  had done  so.  See  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates  v.  Ocasio-Rivera, 991  F.2d  1,  4  (1st Cir.  1993)\r                                     \n\n(observing that the defendant bears the burden of proving his\n\nentitlement  to an acceptance-of-responsibility credit).  The\n\ndistrict   court  ultimately  denied   Tapia  the  additional\n\ndecrease because it found,  based on the record, that  he had\n\nfailed to carry this burden.  \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          We add that the district court's finding adverse to\n\nTapia is  not  clearly  erroneous.    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nMorillo,  8  F.3d  864,  871 (1st  Cir.  1993)  (standard  of\r                   \n\nreview).    Based  on  undisputed  facts  set  forth  in  the\n\nPresentence Investigation Report, it appears that at the time\n\nof his arrest, Tapia resorted to some half-truths and evasion\n\nin order to  minimize his responsibility.  For example, Tapia\n\ntold  arresting officers  that he  was merely  holding heroin\n\nfound  in his apartment for dealers.  When the officers asked\n\nabout an additional one ounce of heroin, Tapia stated that it\n\nhad been  retrieved the day before  by his supplier.   A drug\n\nledger  found in  Tapia's apartment,  however,  reflected the\n\nprofits that could be derived  from the sale of one  ounce of\n\nheroin.      Although  Tapia  was  very  forthcoming  to  the\n\narresting officers  in certain other respects,  we cannot say\n\non this record  that he ever provided complete information to\n\nthe government, much less that he did so in a timely fashion.\n\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                    \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
