In  this  \"slip and  fall\"\n                               \n\ncase, plaintiffs Theresa  and Daniel  Aquilino challenge  the\n\ndistrict   court's  decision   granting  defendant   Harrah's\n\nAtlantic City, Inc.'s (\"Harrah's\") motion to dismiss for lack\n\nof  personal jurisdiction.  Finding no  error in the decision\n\nbelow, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n          Sometime in March  1988, plaintiffs were  overnight\n\nguests at Harrah's  Marina (\"the Hotel\"), a hotel  and casino\n\nin  Atlantic  City,   New  Jersey,  owned  and   operated  by\n\ndefendant.   Every three  or four months  for the  next year,\n\ndefendant  mailed various  marketing brochures  regarding the\n\nHotel to  plaintiffs'  residence  in  Weston,  Massachusetts.\n\nThis   promotional   literature    contained,   inter   alia,\n                                                            \n\ndescriptions   and  photographs   of  Hotel   accommodations,\n\nincluding photographs  of guest  rooms in  \"the Atrium,\"  the\n\nsection of the Hotel where  the injuries in this lawsuit were\n\nallegedly  sustained.1     The  literature   also  emphasized\n\ncertain attributes of the Hotel, including the convenience of\n\nits  gambling facilities  and  the  casino's  late  hours  of\n\noperation.\n\n                    \n\n1.  Defendant's Massachusetts-based solicitation efforts also\nincluded  regular advertisements  in  the  Boston  Globe  and\n                                                        \nmailings to plaintiffs' son, who,  like his parents, had also\npreviously stayed at the Hotel.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          In  March 1989,  after  reviewing this  literature,\n\nplaintiffs made reservations to stay for one night, March 16,\n\n1989, at the Hotel, this time in the Atrium.  Plaintiffs made\n\nthe  reservations over the telephone and charged the expenses\n\nto  Daniel Aquilino's credit card, a  card issued through the\n\nBank of New England in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n          At around 7:30  p.m. on March 16,  1989, plaintiffs\n\narrived at the Hotel.   After having dinner, Daniel  Aquilino\n\nwent to their  room for the  evening, while Theresa  Aquilino\n\nvisited the  casino.   Several  hours  and one  drink  later,\n\nTheresa also retired to the room for the evening.  As she was\n\ndosing off, she  began to feel  uncomfortable and decided  to\n\nretrieve an extra pillow from the closet.  On her way back to\n\nthe bed, she tripped on telephone and/or electrical  cords on\n\nthe floor between the bed and nightstand, sustaining injuries\n\nwhich required medical attention.\n\n          On  March 3, 1992,  plaintiffs filed this diversity\n\naction  in district  court,  alleging claims  for negligence,\n\nbreach of  contract, and  loss of consortium.2   On  June 18,\n\n1992, defendant filed a motion  to dismiss based upon lack of\n\npersonal  jurisdiction,  which  motion   the  district  court\n\n                    \n\n2.  Suit  was  originally brought  against  Harrah's  and its\nparent company, Promus  Companies, Inc.  After  learning that\nPromus was not  a proper party to the  suit, plaintiffs filed\nan amended complaint on May 1, 1992, dropping Promus.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ngranted on February  22, 1993.  After an  unsuccessful motion\n\nto reconsider, plaintiffs filed this appeal.   \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n          In their  appeal, plaintiffs advance  the following\n\narguments:   (1) that  both Massachusetts long-arm  statutes,\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 223   38 and Mass. Gen. L. ch. 223A   3(a),\n\nconfer personal jurisdiction over defendant; and (2) that the\n\ndistrict   court   abused   its   discretion  in   dismissing\n\nplaintiffs'    complaint    without    allowing   discovery.3\n\nUnfortunately for plaintiffs, we have recently rejected these\n\nvery arguments in a  case closely on  point.  See Crocker  v.\n                                                         \n\nHilton Int'l Barbados  Ltd., 976 F.2d 797,  798-801 (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1992) (citing Fournier v. Best W. Treasure Island Resort, 962\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 126, 126-27 (1st Cir.  1992); Marino v. Hyatt Corp., 793\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 427,  428-31 (1st Cir. 1986)).4  As  that case is on all\n\nfours with  this one, it  is controlling.5   Accordingly, for\n\n                    \n\n3.  Plaintiffs  also contend  that the  exercise of  personal\njurisdiction would not offend the Fourteenth Amendment's  Due\nProcess clause.   Because  we find infra,  however, that  the\n                                        \nstate  long-arm statutes fail to confer jurisdiction, we need\nnot reach the merits of their constitutional argument.\n\n4.  Much of plaintiffs' brief is devoted to arguing that  the\nFirst Circuit's interpretation of the Massachusetts  long-arm\nstatutes is patently mistaken.  This panel is, however, bound\nby prior panel decisions  closely on point.   E.g., Fournier,\n                                                            \n962 F.2d at 127.  \n\n5.  Plaintiffs attempt  to distinguish  Crocker, both on  the\n                                               \nissue of Massachusetts long-arm jurisdiction and the issue of\ndiscovery, by pointing out  various factual differences which\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nthe reasons therein  stated, we reject plaintiffs'  appeal as\n\nmeritless.\n\n          Affirmed.  Costs to appellee.\n                                       \n\n                    \n\nthey contend  have legal  significance.   We have  considered\neach of these contentions and find them to be without merit.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n",

After an unsuccessful motion to reconsider, plaintiffs filed this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their appeal, plaintiffs advance the following arguments:  (1) that both Massachusetts long-arm statutes, Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 223 Sec. 38 and Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  223A Sec. 3(a), confer personal jurisdiction over defendant;  and (2) that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing plaintiffs' complaint without allowing discovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Unfortunately for plaintiffs, we have recently rejected these very arguments in a case closely on point.

Because we find infra, however, that the state long-arm statutes fail to confer jurisdiction, we need not reach the merits of their constitutional argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Much of plaintiffs' brief is devoted to arguing that the First Circuit's interpretation of the Massachusetts long-arm statutes is patently mistaken.  This panel is, however, bound by prior panel decisions closely on point.
