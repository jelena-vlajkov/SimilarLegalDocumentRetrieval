On March  16,  1988, the  Board of\r\n\nRegistration in  Medicine for the  Commonwealth of  Massachusetts\r\n\n(\"Massachusetts  Board\")  revoked   Wang's  medical  license  for\r\n\nprofessional misconduct.1   In  light of the  Massachusetts Board\r\n\naction against Wang, the New  Hampshire Board of Registration  in\r\n\nMedicine (\"New  Hampshire Board\" or  \"Board\") issued an  order on\r\n\nJuly  20,  1988, suspending  his  New  Hampshire medical  license\r\n\npursuant to  the  New Hampshire  reciprocal revocation  statute,2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  charges and findings appear in Wang v. Board of Regis-\r                                                                           \r\ntration in Medicine, 537 N.E.2d 1216 (Mass. 1989).\r                             \r\n\n     2The reciprocal  revocation statute, N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.  \r\n329:17-c (1984), in effect at the time provided:\r\n\n     The  board may  summarily deny  a license  to, or  revoke or\r\n     restrict  the license of, any  person who has been subjected\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nand  allowing him  until August 26  to request  an administrative\r\n\nhearing.\r\n\n          Wang  promptly  obtained preliminary  injunctive relief\r\n\nfrom  a New  Hampshire superior  court, enjoining  the suspension\r\n\norder  pending  a revocation  hearing  before  the New  Hampshire\r\n\nBoard.   The Board in turn  withdrew its suspension order and, on\r\n\nAugust 11, 1988, ordered that  Wang show cause why his  New Hamp-\r\n\nshire license  ought not  be revoked  on the  ground that  he had\r\n\nnever informed the  Board of the license  revocation order issued\r\n\nby the Massachusetts  Board.  On October  5, 1988, the  New Hamp-\r\n\nshire Board  decided to investigate Wang's  New Hampshire medical\r\n\npractice.\r\n\n          Pending  investigation by the New Hampshire Board, Wang\r\n\nappealed the Massachusetts Board  license revocation order to the\r\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\").  Contemporaneously,\r\n\nWang sought    and on February 23, 1989, obtained    a second New\r\n\nHampshire superior court order, enjoining the New Hampshire Board\r\n\nfrom pursuing \"any hearing  the result of which might  be revoca-\r\n\ntion of [Wang's] New Hampshire license based on the action of the\r\n\nMassachusetts  Board  . .  .  until such  time  as the  matter in\r\n\nMassachusetts has  been finally adjudicated  in the [SJC].\"   Two\r\n\nmonths later     on reconsideration    the New Hampshire superior\r\n\ncourt vacated  its  injunction for  lack  of jurisdiction.    The\r\n\nfollowing week,  the SJC  upheld the Massachusetts  Board license\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     to disciplinary  action related to  professional conduct  by\r\n     the competent authority of any other jurisdiction.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nrevocation order. \r\n\n          On  May 22,  1989,  counsel was  appointed  by the  New\r\n\nHampshire  Board  to  investigate  Wang's New  Hampshire  medical\r\n\npractice.   The investigation  took over  two years, followed  by\r\n\nhearings commencing in  July and  ending in October,  1991.   The\r\n\nBoard  found that      in and  of  itself     the  unprofessional\r\n\nconduct  which had  prompted  the Massachusetts  Board to  revoke\r\n\nWang's medical license warranted  revocation of his New Hampshire\r\n\nlicense.    Further, the  Board  found  that Wang's  unreasonable\r\n\nwithholding of  information from the Board  during its investiga-\r\n\ntion into  his New  Hampshire medical  practice, and  his failure\r\n\neven  to  demonstrate  an  attempt to  address  the  professional\r\n\ndeficiencies  in his  Massachusetts practice, combined  \"not only\r\n\n[to] justify,  but [to] require reciprocal  license revocation in\r\n\nNew Hampshire.\"  On  March 5, 1992, the Board  issued its written\r\n\ndecision and order revoking Wang's New Hampshire medical license.\r\n\n          Wang  appealed  the  revocation  decision  to  the  New\r\n\nHampshire Supreme Court, claiming deprivations of his due process\r\n\nrights under state and  federal law, including alleged violations\r\n\nof the Board's own rules,  regulations and enabling statutes, and\r\n\nasserting conflicts of interest and unfair prejudice on  the part\r\n\nof Board  members and its counsel.   On August 26,  1992, the New\r\n\nHampshire Supreme Court summarily affirmed the license revocation\r\n\norder, finding  the New  Hampshire Board decision  neither unjust\r\n\nnor unreasonable,  and that  the appeal presented  no substantial\r\n\nquestion of law.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          Meanwhile, on  November 22, 1991, before  the New Hamp-\r\n\nshire  Board's license  revocation  order ever  issued, Wang  had\r\n\ncommenced  the present action against the  Board, its members and\r\n\ncounsel,  in the United States District Court for the District of\r\n\nNew  Hampshire.   The federal  complaint under  42 U.S.C.    1983\r\n\nasserted claims  for monetary relief and for temporary and perma-\r\n\nnent injunctive relief enjoining  further disciplinary action  by\r\n\nthe Board; a  judicial declaration that the Board's  actions were\r\n\nfundamentally unfair and violative of Wang's right to due process\r\n\nof law; and an award of  attorney fees against Board members  and\r\n\nits counsel in their individual capacities.  The federal district\r\n\ncourt stayed  its  proceedings  pending  a decision  by  the  New\r\n\nHampshire Supreme Court.\r\n\n          All  defendants  moved  to dismiss  the  federal action\r\n\nshortly after the New  Hampshire Supreme Court summarily affirmed\r\n\nthe New Hampshire Board's license revocation order.  The district\r\n\ncourt  dismissed the claims for monetary relief against the Board\r\n\nand  its  members,  in  their official  capacities,  on  Eleventh\r\n\nAmendment  immunity  grounds.   Later,  the  claims for  monetary\r\n\nrelief against Board members and its counsel, in their individual\r\n\ncapacities,  were dismissed  on  grounds  of  absolute  immunity.\r\n\nFinally, on  July 12,  1994, the  district court entered  summary\r\n\njudgment on the claims for  injunctive relief against the  Board,\r\n\nfinding that  it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the\r\n\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court decision.  Wang appealed.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          On appeal, Wang contends  that the district court erred\r\n\nin dismissing  his claims for  monetary relief against  the Board\r\n\nand  its members in their  official capacities; in sustaining the\r\n\nabsolute  immunity claims  interposed  by Board  members and  its\r\n\ncounsel,  acting in  their individual  capacities, in  that these\r\n\ndefendants had  exceeded their respective adjudicative and prose-\r\n\ncutorial roles  and  would be  entitled,  at most,  to  qualified\r\n\nimmunity  under New Hampshire law;  and in ruling  that it lacked\r\n\nsubject  matter jurisdiction  to  afford  prospective  injunctive\r\n\nrelief.\r\n\nA.

Martinez  v. California,  444  U.S. 277,  284 n.8\r                                                 \r\n\n(1980).  Wang nonetheless contends that the Board members and its\r\n\ncounsel, in their individual  capacities, were entitled, at most,\r\n\nto \"good faith\" immunity (under  New Hampshire law) from monetary\r\n\nliability under section 1983.  As we discern no material distinc-\r\n\ntion  between  the  quasi-judicial  and  prosecutorial  functions\r\n\nperformed  by these  defendants  in behalf  of the  New Hampshire\r\n\nBoard, and those performed  by their Massachusetts Board counter-\r\n\nparts,  the  district  court order  dismissing  these \"individual\r\n\ncapacity\" claims was entirely  proper.  See Bettencourt v.

State\r\n\nofficials  performing prosecutorial functions  -- including their\r\n\ndecisions to  initiate administrative proceedings aimed  at legal\r\n\nsanctions -- are entitled to absolute immunity as well.

Thus, New Hampshire\r                              \r\n\nBoard counsel, like  the Massachusetts Board professional  staff,\r\n\nsee Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 785, is absolutely immune from suit,\r                         \r\n\nin his individual capacity, based on his participation in partic-\r\n\nular cases before the Board.

Further, the superior  court faulted\r\nthe multiple roles assumed  by Assistant Attorney General Douglas\r\nJones, as Board counsel and prosecutor.  \"Under such circumstanc-\r\nes there could not be even the appearance of fairness,\" the court\r\nsaid.\r\n     On  appeal,  Wang relies  heavily  on  these superior  court\r\nfindings  for his claim that the Board proceedings were devoid of\r\ndue process.  But  the superior court findings are  without legal\r\neffect since  the superior court lacked  subject matter jurisdic-\r\ntion and its findings  were implicitly rejected by the  New Hamp-\r\nshire  Supreme   Court  decision  affirming   the  Board's  final\r\nrevocation order.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nwould be absolutely immune from suit, in their individual capaci-\r\n\nties,  on section  1983 claims  arising out  of their  respective\r\n\njudicial,  quasi-judicial  and/or  prosecutorial functions,  even\r\n\nthough  they acted \"maliciously and  corruptly.\"  Pierson v.

Wang concedes  that the  final license\r\n\nrevocation  order issued by the  New Hampshire Board  was not the\r                                                                       \r\n\nproduct of a summary proceeding.   Considering that almost  three\r\n\nyears  elapsed  between  the  commencement  of  the  disciplinary\r\n\ninvestigation and the entry  of the revocation order,  we believe\r\n\nthe  concession is well  founded.  Moreover,  the Board conducted\r\n\nseveral hearings  at which  Wang and  his attorney  appeared; the\r\n\nproceedings were  transcribed; the  Board issued a  written deci-\r\n\nsion; and Wang was afforded    and utilized to the fullest    the\r\n\nright  to appeal  the  final Board  order  to the  New  Hampshire\r\n\nSupreme Court.   We find  no basis in fact  or law for  the claim\r\n\nthat the procedural safeguards accorded Wang by the New Hampshire\r\n\nBoard differed in any  significant respect from those the  Massa-\r\n\nchusetts Board afforded the  respondent in Bettencourt.

On March 16, 1988, the Board of Registration in Medicine for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (\"Massachusetts Board\") revoked Wang's medical license for professional misconduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In light of the Massachusetts Board action against Wang, the New Hampshire Board of Registration in Medicine (\"New Hampshire Board\" or \"Board\") issued an order on July 20, 1988, suspending his New Hampshire medical license pursuant to the New Hampshire reciprocal revocation statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and allowing him until August 26 to request an administrative hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wang promptly obtained preliminary injunctive relief from a New Hampshire superior court, enjoining the suspension order pending a revocation hearing before the New Hampshire Board.  The Board in turn withdrew its suspension order and, on August 11, 1988, ordered that Wang show cause why his New Hampshire license ought not be revoked on the ground that he had never informed the Board of the license revocation order issued by the Massachusetts Board.  On October 5, 1988, the New Hampshire Board decided to investigate Wang's New Hampshire medical practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pending investigation by the New Hampshire Board, Wang appealed the Massachusetts Board license revocation order to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\").  Contemporaneously, Wang sought--and on February 23, 1989, obtained--a second New Hampshire superior court order, enjoining the New Hampshire Board from pursuing \"any hearing the result of which might be revocation of [Wang's] New Hampshire license based on the action of the Massachusetts Board ... until such time as the matter in Massachusetts has been finally adjudicated in the [SJC].\"  Two months later--on reconsideration--the New Hampshire superior court vacated its injunction for lack of jurisdiction.

The investigation took over two years, followed by hearings commencing in July and ending in October, 1991.  The Board found that--in and of itself--the unprofessional conduct which had prompted the Massachusetts Board to revoke Wang's medical license warranted revocation of his New Hampshire license.  Further, the Board found that Wang's unreasonable withholding of information from the Board during its investigation into his New Hampshire medical practice, and his failure even to demonstrate an attempt to address the professional deficiencies in his Massachusetts practice, combined \"not only [to] justify, but [to] require reciprocal license revocation in New Hampshire.\"   On March 5, 1992, the Board issued its written decision and order revoking Wang's New Hampshire medical license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wang appealed the revocation decision to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, claiming deprivations of his due process rights under state and federal law, including alleged violations of the Board's own rules, regulations and enabling statutes, and asserting conflicts of interest and unfair prejudice on the part of Board members and its counsel.  On August 26, 1992, the New Hampshire Supreme Court summarily affirmed the license revocation order, finding the New Hampshire Board decision neither unjust nor unreasonable, and that the appeal presented no substantial question of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on November 22, 1991, before the New Hampshire Board's license revocation order ever issued, Wang had commenced the present action against the Board, its members and counsel, in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.  The federal complaint under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 asserted claims for monetary relief and for temporary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining further disciplinary action by the Board;  a judicial declaration that the Board's actions were fundamentally unfair and violative of Wang's right to due process of law;  and an award of attorney fees against Board members and its counsel in their individual capacities.  The federal district court stayed its proceedings pending a decision by the New Hampshire Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All defendants moved to dismiss the federal action shortly after the New Hampshire Supreme Court summarily affirmed the New Hampshire Board's license revocation order.  The district court dismissed the claims for monetary relief against the Board and its members, in their official capacities, on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds.  Later, the claims for monetary relief against Board members and its counsel, in their individual capacities, were dismissed on grounds of absolute immunity.  Finally, on July 12, 1994, the district court entered summary judgment on the claims for injunctive relief against the Board, finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the New Hampshire Supreme Court decision.  Wang appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Wang contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claims for monetary relief against the Board and its members in their official capacities;  in sustaining the absolute immunity claims interposed by Board members and its counsel, acting in their individual capacities, in that these defendants had exceeded their respective adjudicative and prosecutorial roles and would be entitled, at most, to qualified immunity under New Hampshire law;  and in ruling that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to afford prospective injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

Rodriguez, 943 F.2d 104, 108 (1st Cir.1991) (citing Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2312, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989)), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1063, 112 S.Ct. 948, 117 L.Ed.2d 117 (1992);  see also Kaimowitz v. Board of Trustees, Univ. of Ill., 951 F.2d 765, 767 (7th Cir.1991) (finding that, as neither the state nor its \"alter ego\" (state university) is a \"person\" for section 1983 purposes, neither is subject to suit under section 1983), we affirm the dismissal of the claims for monetary relief against the Board and its members acting in their official capacities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Board Members and Board Counsel (Individual Capacities)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immunity claims in section 1983 actions are governed by federal law.  Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 284 n. 8, 100 S.Ct. 553, 558 n. 8, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980).  Wang nonetheless contends that the Board members and its counsel, in their individual capacities, were entitled, at most, to \"good faith\" immunity (under New Hampshire law) from monetary liability under section 1983.  As we discern no material distinction between the quasi-judicial and prosecutorial functions performed by these defendants in behalf of the New Hampshire Board, and those performed by their Massachusetts Board counterparts, the district court order dismissing these \"individual capacity\" claims was entirely proper.  See Bettencourt v. Board of Registration in Medicine, 904 F.2d 772, 782-85 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Board members and its professional staff were held absolutely immune from suit in their individual capacities under section 1983, on the ground that these officials serve in quasi-judicial capacities \"functionally comparable\" to those performed by a state court judge.  Id. at 783.   As with the Massachusetts Board, New Hampshire Board members weigh evidence and make factual determinations, N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 329:17(VI), determine sanctions, see id. Sec. 329:17(VII), and issue written decisions in disciplinary actions.  See id. Sec. 329:18(III).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Wang attempts to differentiate between the two administrative tribunals on the ground that the New Hampshire Board assumed an \"inquisitorial or investigative role\" in this case by instigating and prosecuting the charges against him, the attempted distinction is without legal significance.  State officials performing prosecutorial functions--including their decisions to initiate administrative proceedings aimed at legal sanctions--are entitled to absolute immunity as well.  See Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 515, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2915, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978);  see also Horwitz v. Board of Medical Examiners, 822 F.2d 1508, 1515 (10th Cir.)  (describing Colorado medical board officials' adjudicatory and prosecutorial role), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 964, 108 S.Ct. 453, 98 L.Ed.2d 394 (1987).  Thus, New Hampshire Board counsel, like the Massachusetts Board professional staff, see Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 785, is absolutely immune from suit, in his individual capacity, based on his participation in particular cases before the Board.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wang next argues that the New Hampshire Board members and its counsel were imbued with such \"overwhelming malice and bad faith\" that due process was not to be had at their hands.  The allegation of malice and bad faith is founded principally on the New Hampshire superior court decision--preliminarily enjoining further Board action--entered on February 23, 1989, and vacated for lack of subject matter jurisdiction two months later.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming a level of malice and bad faith sufficient to poison the New Hampshire Board proceedings--contrary to the record evidence, as well as the New Hampshire Supreme Court decision--the Board members and its counsel nonetheless would be absolutely immune from suit, in their individual capacities, on section 1983 claims arising out of their respective judicial, quasi-judicial and/or prosecutorial functions, even though they acted \"maliciously and corruptly.\"  Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 554, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1218, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967);  Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 424, 96 S.Ct. 984, 992, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976) (extending absolute immunity under section 1983 to prosecutors acting in quasi-judicial capacity).  Nor does Wang claim that his medical license was revoked by the Board in the \"clear absence of all jurisdiction.\"  Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 357, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (quoting Bradley v. Fisher, 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) 335, 351, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1871));  see also Ricci v. Key Bancshares of Maine, Inc., 768 F.2d 456, 462 (1st Cir.1985) (\"The conduct in question need only be more or less connected to 'the general matters committed by law to [the Board's] control or supervision' and not 'manifestly or palpably beyond [the Board's] authority.' \")  (quoting Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U.S. 483, 498, 16 S.Ct. 631, 637, 40 L.Ed. 780 (1896)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Wang contends that absolute immunity cannot insulate Board members and its counsel from suit, since the challenged disciplinary action was taken pursuant to a New Hampshire reciprocal revocation statute, see N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 329:17-c (1984), unconstitutional on its face.  He reasons that though our decision in Bettencourt might support absolute immunity for medical board members and its counsel, provided their actions were taken under adequate procedural safeguards, Bettencourt does not immunize such officials from suit in their individual capacities for official actions summarily taken under a reciprocal revocation statute simply on the ground that another jurisdiction has revoked the respondent's license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline the invitation to provide an advisory opinion on a claim for which there is no evidentiary support in the appellate record.  See United States Nat'l Bank of Or. v. Independent Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 2178, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993) (\" 'The exercise of judicial power under Art.  III of the Constitution depends on the existence of a case or controversy,' and 'a federal court [lacks] the power to render advisory opinions.' \")  (citations omitted);  State of R.I. v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 705 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 298, 130 L.Ed.2d 211 (1994) (same).  Wang concedes that the final license revocation order issued by the New Hampshire Board was not the product of a summary proceeding.  Considering that almost three years elapsed between the commencement of the disciplinary investigation and the entry of the revocation order, we believe the concession is well founded.  Moreover, the Board conducted several hearings at which Wang and his attorney appeared;  the proceedings were transcribed;  the Board issued a written decision;  and Wang was afforded--and utilized to the fullest--the right to appeal the final Board order to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  We find no basis in fact or law for the claim that the procedural safeguards accorded Wang by the New Hampshire Board differed in any significant respect from those the Massachusetts Board afforded the respondent in Bettencourt.   See 904 F.2d at 783.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Injunctive Relief</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Wang challenges the summary judgment entered against him on the claim for permanent injunctive relief against the Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In particular, he attacks the federal district court ruling that this claim is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the New Hampshire Supreme Court decision disallowing his appeal from the New Hampshire Board's license revocation order and, consequently, that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin the present claim.  See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923);  District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1311-12, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).  Wang argued to the New Hampshire Supreme Court that the procedure by which his medical license was revoked failed to afford him due process of law.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected his claim, and its decision was reviewable only by the United States Supreme Court.  See Feldman, 460 U.S. at 482, 103 S.Ct. at 1314-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wang frivolously argues, nonetheless, that the Rooker- Feldman doctrine does not bar the constitutional claims asserted below in support of his request for permanent injunctive relief against further disciplinary proceedings by the Board, because unlike the plaintiffs in Feldman, there is no other forum available to him.  He is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wang raised the due process claim before the New Hampshire Supreme Court, albeit unsuccessfully, and may not obtain review of its decision in federal district court on any pretext.  Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de P.R., 917 F.2d 620, 628 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[L]ower federal courts have no jurisdiction to hear appeals from state court decisions, even if the state judgment is challenged as unconstitutional.\"), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1029, 112 S.Ct. 865, 116 L.Ed.2d 772 (1992) (emphasis added).  Constitutional claims presented to a United States district court, and found to be \"inextricably intertwined\" with state court proceedings, impermissibly invite the federal district court, \"in essence,\" to review a final state court decision.  Feldman, 460 U.S. at 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. at 1315.   Lower federal courts are without subject matter jurisdiction to sit in direct review of state court decisions.  Id.

Wang, M.D., appeals from a district court judgment dismissing his claims for monetary and equitable relief relating to certain disciplinary proceedings conducted by the New Hampshire Board of Registration in Medicine, which culminated in the revocation of his license to practice medicine in New Hampshire.

On March 16, 1988, the Board of Registration in Medicine for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (\"Massachusetts Board\") revoked Wang's medical license for professional misconduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In light of the Massachusetts Board action against Wang, the New Hampshire Board of Registration in Medicine (\"New Hampshire Board\" or \"Board\") issued an order on July 20, 1988, suspending his New Hampshire medical license pursuant to the New Hampshire reciprocal revocation statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and allowing him until August 26 to request an administrative hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wang promptly obtained preliminary injunctive relief from a New Hampshire superior court, enjoining the suspension order pending a revocation hearing before the New Hampshire Board.  The Board in turn withdrew its suspension order and, on August 11, 1988, ordered that Wang show cause why his New Hampshire license ought not be revoked on the ground that he had never informed the Board of the license revocation order issued by the Massachusetts Board.  On October 5, 1988, the New Hampshire Board decided to investigate Wang's New Hampshire medical practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pending investigation by the New Hampshire Board, Wang appealed the Massachusetts Board license revocation order to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\").  Contemporaneously, Wang sought--and on February 23, 1989, obtained--a second New Hampshire superior court order, enjoining the New Hampshire Board from pursuing \"any hearing the result of which might be revocation of [Wang's] New Hampshire license based on the action of the Massachusetts Board ... until such time as the matter in Massachusetts has been finally adjudicated in the [SJC].\"  Two months later--on reconsideration--the New Hampshire superior court vacated its injunction for lack of jurisdiction.

The investigation took over two years, followed by hearings commencing in July and ending in October, 1991.  The Board found that--in and of itself--the unprofessional conduct which had prompted the Massachusetts Board to revoke Wang's medical license warranted revocation of his New Hampshire license.  Further, the Board found that Wang's unreasonable withholding of information from the Board during its investigation into his New Hampshire medical practice, and his failure even to demonstrate an attempt to address the professional deficiencies in his Massachusetts practice, combined \"not only [to] justify, but [to] require reciprocal license revocation in New Hampshire.\"   On March 5, 1992, the Board issued its written decision and order revoking Wang's New Hampshire medical license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wang appealed the revocation decision to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, claiming deprivations of his due process rights under state and federal law, including alleged violations of the Board's own rules, regulations and enabling statutes, and asserting conflicts of interest and unfair prejudice on the part of Board members and its counsel.  On August 26, 1992, the New Hampshire Supreme Court summarily affirmed the license revocation order, finding the New Hampshire Board decision neither unjust nor unreasonable, and that the appeal presented no substantial question of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on November 22, 1991, before the New Hampshire Board's license revocation order ever issued, Wang had commenced the present action against the Board, its members and counsel, in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.  The federal complaint under 42 U.S.C.

Wang concedes that the final license revocation order issued by the New Hampshire Board was not the product of a summary proceeding.  Considering that almost three years elapsed between the commencement of the disciplinary investigation and the entry of the revocation order, we believe the concession is well founded.  Moreover, the Board conducted several hearings at which Wang and his attorney appeared;  the proceedings were transcribed;  the Board issued a written decision;  and Wang was afforded--and utilized to the fullest--the right to appeal the final Board order to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.
