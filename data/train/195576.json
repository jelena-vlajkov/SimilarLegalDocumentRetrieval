Plaintiffs  Town of  Farmington, its\n                     \n\nBoard of  Selectmen, and Steven S.  Moore, the superintendent\n\nof  Farmington's sewage  treatment plant  (collectively, \"the\n\nTown\") filed this diversity action seeking a declaration that\n\nTudor Insurance Co. (\"Tudor\")  has a duty to defend  the Town\n\nagainst  a suit  brought  by  Cottle Enterprises  (\"Cottle\").\n\nCottle, the developer of a mobile home park frustrated by the\n\nTown's refusal to allow  more than two sewer hook-ups  a year\n\nat the new park, sued the Town in state court seeking damages\n\nbecause  of  the  hook-up  limitation.    A  magistrate-judge\n\nrecommended that the district  court grant Tudor's motion for\n\nsummary judgment, reasoning that  all of Cottle's claims fall\n\nwithin the  \"inversion condemnation exclusion\" clause  of the\n\nmunicipal liability  insurance policy  issued to the  Town by\n\nTudor.   The  district court  adopted the  recommendation and\n\nentered judgment in  favor of Tudor.   This appeal  followed.\n\nBecause our  independent analysis leads us  to the conclusion\n\nthat Tudor is  indeed \"entitled  to judgment as  a matter  of\n\nlaw,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n          The facts underlying this appeal are undisputed and\n\nadequately laid out in the written opinion of the magistrate-\n\njudge, see Town of Farmington v. Tudor Ins. Co., No. 93-0074-\n                                               \n\nB (Jan.  31, 1994).  The parties agree that Maine law governs\n\n                             -2-\n\nthe  interpretation  of the  Town's  insurance  policy.   The\n\nlanguage in dispute is the following:\n\n          [Tudor]  shall  not  be  liable  to  make\n          payment  for Loss in  connection with any\n          claim    made   against    the   Insureds\n          allegedly, based upon or arising out of .\n          . . inverse condemnation . . . .\n\n                             II. \n                             II.\n\n          The  Town's first  argument on  appeal is  that the\n\nmagistrate-judge failed to  follow Maine  law in  determining\n\nthat the  phrase \"inverse  condemnation\" is unambiguous.   We\n\ndisagree.    Maine  law  favors  the  insured  in  construing\n\nambiguities   in  insurance   contracts  and   encourages  an\n\nexpansive view of the  insurer's duty to defend.   See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnion  Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Inhabitants of Topsham, 441 A.2d\n                                                   \n\n1012, 1015 (Me.  1982).  Nonetheless, even  if the boundaries\n\nof \"inverse condemnation\" are  not firmly settled, we believe\n\nthe  phrase has  an  unambiguous core  meaning, namely,  \"[a]\n\ncause  of action against  a government agency  to recover the\n\nvalue  of property  taken  by the  agency,  though no  formal\n\nexercise of the power of eminent  domain has been completed,\"\n\nBlack's  Law  Dictionary  740   (5th  ed.  1979).    Cottle's\n                        \n\n\"confiscatory  taking\"  claim  (Count  I  of  its  complaint)\n\nclearly fits within this category.\n\n          The  Town next  suggests that  the magistrate-judge\n\nincorrectly  determined that  the  other counts  in  Cottle's\n\ncomplaint are  \"based upon or  aris[e] out  of . .  . inverse\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ncondemnation.\"    Once  again, we  cannot  agree.   Like  the\n\nmagistrate-judge,  we  think  that  Baywood  Corp.  v.  Maine\n                                                             \n\nBonding &amp;  Casualty Co., 628  A.2d 1029 (Me.  1993), provides\n                       \n\nthe relevant  framework for  analyzing the merits  of Tudor's\n\nmotion  for summary judgment.1  In that case, Baywood, a real\n\nestate developer,  sought a  declaration that  Maine Bonding,\n\nits  insurer, had a duty to defend  it against a lawsuit by a\n\ncondominium   association   representing   buyers  of   units\n\ndeveloped by  Baywood.  The association  alleged that Baywood\n\nperformed faulty  work in designing  the development's  sewer\n\nsystem,  and sought compensation for the cost of replacing or\n\nupgrading the system.   While Maine Bonding would have  had a\n\nduty  to defend  Baywood  against an  allegation of  property\n\ndamage, the  insurance policy at issue  specifically excluded\n\ncoverage  for claims  seeking  the repair  or replacement  of\n\nfaulty  work.  See id. at 1031.   The court held that because\n                      \n\nthe association's claim was qualitatively different from  the\n\ntype of third  party claim  covered by the  policy at  issue,\n\nMaine Bonding had  no duty to  defend Baywood.   See id.   In\n                                                        \n\nreaching this  conclusion, the  court focused  exclusively on\n\nthe type of harm alleged, attaching no importance to the fact\n\nthat the underlying  complaint charged that Baywood's  faulty\n\n                    \n\n1.  We  note with  dismay  that, although  Baywood was  cited\n                                                  \nprominently by the magistrate-judge,  see Town of Farmington,\n                                                            \nslip op. at 5 n.2,  the Town chose not to mention,  much less\ndistinguish, the case in its brief. \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nwork  amounted to a violation  of various legal  duties.  See\n                                                             \n\nid.  at  1030  (noting   that  the  association  had  alleged\n   \n\n\"fraudulent misrepresentation, breach  of warranty, breach of\n\ncontract,  negligence,  negligent  misrepresentation,  and  a\n\nviolation of the uniform fraudulent transfer act\").\n\n          An analysis of the type of harm alleged in Cottle's\n\ncomplaint leads to a similar conclusion in this case.  Cottle\n\nseeks  compensation for the  diminution in  the value  of his\n\nland caused by the  Town's regulatory actions.  Although  the\n\ncomplaint alleges  that the Town's  regulatory maneuvers  are\n\nviolative  of  a  number  of constitutional  and  common  law\n\nduties, each  count seeks compensation  for the same  type of\n\nharm alleged in  the \"confiscatory taking\"  count.  In  other\n\nwords, Cottle has not alleged  any wrongful conduct that does\n\nnot  \"arise[] out of . . . inverse condemnation.\"  Therefore,\n\nthe inverse  condemnation exclusion clause and  Maine law (as\n\nexpounded in Baywood) combine to preclude the Town's claim.\n                    \n\n                             III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  we affirm the  district\n\ncourt's entry of summary judgment.\n\n          So ordered.\n                    \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n",

See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  In reaching </span>this conclusion, the court focused exclusively on the type of harm alleged, attaching no importance to the fact that the underlying complaint charged that Baywood's faulty work amounted to a violation of various legal duties.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1030 </span>(noting that the association had alleged \"fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of contract, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and a violation of the uniform fraudulent transfer act\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An analysis of the type of harm alleged in Cottle's complaint leads to a similar conclusion in this case.  Cottle seeks compensation for the diminution in the value of his land caused by the Town's regulatory actions.  Although the complaint alleges that the Town's regulatory maneuvers are violative of a number of constitutional and common law duties, each count seeks compensation for the same type of harm alleged in the \"confiscatory taking\" count.  In other words, Cottle has not alleged any wrongful conduct that does not \"arise[ ] out of ... inverse condemnation.\"  Therefore, the inverse condemnation exclusion clause and Maine law (as expounded in Baywood ) combine to preclude the Town's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note with dismay that, although Baywood was cited prominently by the magistrate-judge, see Town of Farmington, slip op. at 5 n.2, the Town chose not to mention, much less distinguish, the case in its brief</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
