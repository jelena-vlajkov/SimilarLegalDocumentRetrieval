Claimant Antonio Rivera Garay filed an\r                                \n\napplication  for  social  security  disability   benefits  on\n\nJanuary  9, 1990, alleging disability  due to a  back and leg\n\ncondition, associated pain, and an anxiety disorder.  After a\n\nhearing,  the Administrative  Law Judge  (ALJ)  conceded that\n\nclaimant  had   a  severe  impairment  or   impairments,  but\n\nconcluded that claimant  was not  disabled at step  4 of  the\n\nsequential evaluation process,  20 C.F.R.    404.1520(e),  on\n\nthe ground  that claimant's impairments did  not preclude his\n\nreturn to his former job as a lottery ticket vendor.  The ALJ\n\nbased  this determination  on the  testimony of  a vocational\n\nexpert  at the  hearing  that an  individual with  claimant's\n\nimpairments, as described by the ALJ, could perform that job.\n\n          After the Appeals Council denied claimant's request\n\nfor review of  the ALJ's decision,  claimant appealed to  the\n\ndistrict  court, which affirmed.   On  appeal to  this court,\n\nclaimant  argues  that   the  Secretary's  decision   is  not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.  We agree, and we direct a\n\nremand  to  the  Secretary   for  the  taking  of  additional\n\nvocational evidence.\n\n                      Background\r                                            \n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          We   review  the   Secretary's  decision   under  a\n\n\"substantial evidence\" standard; we will affirm that decision\n\nif it is supported by \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable\n\nmind  might  accept as  adequate  to  support a  conclusion.\"\n\nRichardson v. Perales, 402  U.S. 389, 401 (1971).   The ALJ's\r                                 \n\ndetermination that  claimant could perform his  past work was\n\nbased  on the  vocational  expert's  answers to  hypothetical\n\nquestions  posed by the ALJ.  We must, therefore, examine the\n\nsoundness of  those questions' premises.  If the premises are\n\nsupported  by substantial  evidence in  the record,  then the\n\nvocational expert's responses constitute substantial evidence\n\nto support the ALJ's vocational determination that claimant's\n\nimpairment  do not preclude his former work.  If the premises\n\nlack record  support, then the vocational  expert's responses\n\nare  not substantial evidence.  \"[I]n  order for a vocational\n\nexpert's answer  to a  hypothetical question to  be relevant,\n\nthe  inputs   into  that  hypothetical   must  correspond  to\n\nconclusions  that  are  supported  by the  outputs  from  the\n\nmedical  authorities.\"   Arocho  v. Secretary  of Health  and\r                                                                         \n\nHuman Services, 670 F.2d 374, 375 (1st Cir. 1982).\r                          \n\n          The ALJ described claimant's  exertional impairment\n\nto the vocational expert as follows:  \n\n        [C]onsidering  the claimant's  age, education\n        and working experience;  considering that  he\n        can alternate positions, can perform fine and\n        gross manipulation,  he can push and  pull up\n        to  25  pounds,  frequently.    That  he  can\n        occasionally lift more than 25  pounds.  That\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n        he  would  be  limited  in the  use  of  foot\n        controls, but that he  could bend, squat,  he\n        could  pull  and  push  the  weight mentioned\n        before.  If this  is the situation, are there\n        jobs in  a significant number  that a  person\n        like the  one we have described  before could\n        do?  \n\nThe vocational expert responded that claimant could return to\n\nhis former job as a lottery ticket vendor.\n\n          The  ALJ  then  added a  hypothetical  directed  to\n\nclaimant's  mental impairment,  asking,  \"And if  we added  a\n\nmental  condition  where  the  memory  seems  preserved,  the\n\nrecent, remote and immediate memory is present, there is good\n\nattention,  concentration,  mental  capacity, good  judgment,\n\ngood introversion.   Would your  opinion vary at  all?\"   The\n\nvocational expert responded that it would not.  \n\n          Finally, the ALJ asked, \"And if we gave credibility\n\nto the claimant's complaints as indicated here today, that he\n\nfeels pain in the leg, that the left leg gets  numb, that the\n\nknee  fails him, that he has to use a cane, that he has chest\n\npains, that he  likes to be alone, that he  hears voices.  If\n\nwe  gave   credibility  to   these  complaints,  would   your\n\nappreciation change at all?\"  The vocational expert responded\n\nthat  claimant  could  not  perform  his  past  job  in  that\n\ncondition.\n\n             Claimant's Exertional Impairment\r                                                         \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          Substantial record evidence  exists to support  the\n\nALJ's  description of claimant's  exertional impairment.  Two\n\nnon-examining  physicians,  Dr.  Fragoso and  Dr.  Hernandez,\n\nreviewed   the  record   and  assessed   claimant's  residual\n\nfunctional capacity.  Both found that claimant could lift and\n\ncarry up to 50 pounds, 25 pounds frequently; could sit, walk,\n\nand stand up to six hours each day; could push  and pull; had\n\nno manipulative limitations; and could climb, balance, stoop,\n\nkneel, crouch and crawl at least occasionally.  These medical\n\nfindings, which  constituted the only  medical assessments of\n\nclaimant's  residual  exertional  capacity  in   the  record,\n\nadequately supported the ALJ's hypothetical.  \n\n          It is true that the weight to be given the residual\n\nfunctional capacity assessments  of non-examining  physicians\n\n\"will vary  with the  circumstances, including the  nature of\n\nthe  illness  and  the  information  provided   the  expert.\"\n\nRodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d\r                                                               \n\n218, 223  (1st Cir. 1981).   Claimant's benefits application,\n\nhowever, was denied at step 4, and at step 4 it is ordinarily\n\nclaimant's burden,  not the Secretary's, to  produce evidence\n\nto  demonstrate that  he cannot  return to  his former  work.\n\nGray v.  Heckler, 760 F.2d 369,  375 (1st Cir. 1985).   Since\r                            \n\nclaimant   was   represented   by   counsel,   there  is   no\n\njustification  here for  a  departure from  that  rule.   See\r                                                                         \n\nCurrier v.  Secretary of  Health, Education and  Welfare, 612\r                                                                    \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nF.2d 594,  598 (1st Cir.  1980).  The  onus was  on claimant,\n\ntherefore,  to  introduce   additional  residual   functional\n\ncapacity assessments  relevant to the  step 4  determination.\n\nClaimant having  failed to do so, the  Secretary was entitled\n\nto rely on the assessments of these non-examining physicians.\n\n              Claimant's Allegations of Pain\r                                                        \n\n          We  also find  no error  in the ALJ's  treatment of\n\nclaimant's  subjective complaints  of  pain.   The exertional\n\naspects of claimant's  pain, associated with  claimant's back\n\nand leg condition, are covered by our above remarks.   It was\n\npartly because  of claimant's \"pain or  discomfort related to\n\nback syndrome\" that the ALJ concluded that claimant faced the\n\nexertional limitations the  ALJ outlined in her  hypothetical\n\nto the vocational expert.\n\n          As for  the  non-exertional aspects  of  claimant's\n\npain, we find that the ALJ conducted the kind of inquiry into\n\nclaimant's allegations of pain required by Avery v. Secretary\r                                                                         \n\nof  Health and Human Services,  797 F.2d 19  (1st Cir. 1986),\r                                         \n\nand  that  the ALJ's  decision  to  discredit allegations  of\n\ndisabling pain  was supported  by substantial evidence.   The\n\nrecord supports,  and claimant has not  challenged, the ALJ's\n\nfindings  that claimant  \"has been  taking medication  on his\n\nown, has  not been  going for  treatment consistently and  he\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nshould complain  to the  treating sources so  that corrective\n\naction  may  be undertaken  such  as  prescribe a  substitute\n\nmedication,  decreasing the  frequency or  the dosage  of the\n\nmedication  or  orienting the  claimant  in  terms of  taking\n\nmedication consistently.\"  The ALJ also permissibly relied on\n\nher  own observations  at  the hearing  that claimant  \"had a\n\ncane, but he did not appear to actually need it for  support.\n\nHe  admitted that such cane was not prescribed by any medical\n\nsource and that he bought it on his own.  He was able to sit,\n\nstand  up  and  exercise  body control  with  no  significant\n\nlimitations.\"  This  evidence adequately supported  the ALJ's\n\nfinding, as reflected in  her hypotheticals to the vocational\n\nexpert, that  claimant did  not suffer from  significant pain\n\nbeyond that which contributed to his exertional limitations. \n\n              Claimant's Mental Impairment\r                                                      \n\n          The  deficiency  in  the Secretary's  determination\n\nconcerns   the   ALJ's  description   of   claimant's  mental\n\nimpairment  in  the  ALJ's  hypothetical  to  the  vocational\n\nexpert.  The  hypothetical merely stated that  claimant had a\n\nmental  condition,  without any  description of  any specific\n\nmental  impairment or  any specific  functional consequences.\n\nThe hypothetical  then went on to  list a number  of areas in\n\nwhich claimant's mental capabilities were found to be normal.\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n As  claimant  argues in  his brief  on appeal,  \"the subject\n\nhypothetical  having to do  with appellant's mental condition\n\nposes no mental impairment at all.\"\n\n          The  medical  evidence does  not  permit claimant's\n\nmental  condition to  be ignored  in this  manner.   Even the\n\npsychological  evaluation most  favorable  to the  Secretary,\n\nthat of Dr. Orlando Maldonado Rodriguez conducted on March 7,\n\n1990,  found a \"mild anxiety  disorder.\"  It  did not discuss\n\nwhat, if  any,  functional limitations  that disorder  posed.\n\nThe two assessments by non-examining agency review physicians\n\nof claimant's  residual  mental  capacity,  provided  by  Dr.\n\nReboredo and Dr. Jeanette  Maldonado, found that claimant had\n\na  severe anxiety-related  disorder which  imposed \"moderate\"\n\nlimitations  in  various  functional  areas,   including  the\n\nfollowing:    maintaining  attention  and  concentration  for\n\nextended periods, performing  within a schedule,  maintaining\n\nregular attendance and punctuality, completing a normal  work\n\nday or week  without interruption from  psychologically based\n\nsymptoms,  performing  at  a   consistent  pace  without   an\n\nunreasonable number  and length of rest  periods, interacting\n\nappropriately with the general public, getting along with co-\n\nworkers  without  distracting them  or  exhibiting behavioral\n\nextremes, and  responding appropriately to changes  in a work\n\nsetting.     Of particular  relevance, given  claimant's past\n\nwork as a  lottery ticket  salesman and the  ALJ's denial  of\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nbenefits on the ground that claimant could still perform that\n\njob,  Dr. Reboredor  wrote  that claimant  \"cannot relate  to\n\npublic . . . on a  steady basis,\" and Dr. Jeanette  Maldonado\n\nexpressed a similar view.\n\n          The  ALJ  herself  specifically  concluded  in  her\n\ndecision  that claimant  has \"some  anxiety related  disorder\n\nalthough it is mild to moderate in nature,\" and that he could\n\nnot \"perform . . . complex tasks with detailed instructions.\"\n\nThe ALJ  failed to address, however, what affect the moderate\n\nlimitations  on, for  example,  dealing with  the public  and\n\ncompleting a normal workday  would have on claimant's ability\n\nto perform his past work as a salesman.  \n\n          Although  we  recognize that  the  medical evidence\n\nsupported the  ALJ's finding of  a \"mild to  moderate\" mental\n\ndisorder,  the hypothetical  presented  to the  ALJ --  which\n\neffectively  described no mental limitation  at all -- was at\n\nodds  with  the  medical  evidence  and  with the  ALJ's  own\n\nfinding.    It may  be that  claimant's  former job  could be\n\nperformed by an individual with claimant's \"mild to moderate\"\n\nmental  impairment.  This court is certainly not qualified to\n\nmake  that  determination nor  is it  clear  why the  ALJ was\n\nentitled  to  do  so  in  the  absence  of  expert vocational\n\ntestimony.  Such was not obtained here and, if  there is some\n\nbasis  on which  the  ALJ was  justified  in disregarding  or\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\ndiscounting the medical evidence  as to mental disorder, that\n\nexplanation is not set forth in the ALJ' decision. \n\n                     Conclusion\r                                           \n\n          For the  reasons stated above, the  judgment of the\n\ndistrict  court is  vacated.   We  remand  this case  to  the\r                                       \n\ndistrict court  with instructions to remand  to the Secretary\n\nfor  further proceedings,  which  may include  the taking  of\n\nadditional  vocational evidence,  not inconsistent  with this\n\nopinion.          \n\n                             -10-\r\r\n",

After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) conceded that claimant had a severe impairment or impairments, but concluded that claimant was not disabled at step 4 of the sequential evaluation process, 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1520(e), on the ground that claimant's impairments did not preclude his return to his former job as a lottery ticket vendor.  The ALJ based this determination on the testimony of a vocational expert at the hearing that an individual with claimant's impairments, as described by the ALJ, could perform that job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Appeals Council denied claimant's request for review of the ALJ's decision, claimant appealed to the district court, which affirmed.

We must, therefore, examine the soundness of those questions' premises.  If the premises are supported by substantial evidence in the record, then the vocational expert's responses constitute substantial evidence to support the ALJ's vocational determination that claimant's impairment do not preclude his former work.  If the premises lack record support, then the vocational expert's responses are not substantial evidence.  \"[I]n order for a vocational expert's answer to a hypothetical question to be relevant, the inputs into that hypothetical must correspond to conclusions that are supported by the outputs from the medical authorities.\"  Arocho v.

Two non-examining physicians, Dr. Fragoso and Dr. Hernandez, reviewed the record and assessed claimant's residual functional capacity.  Both found that claimant could lift and carry up to 50 pounds, 25 pounds frequently;  could sit, walk, and stand up to six hours each day;  could push and pull;  had no manipulative limitations;  and could climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch and crawl at least occasionally.  These medical findings, which constituted the only medical assessments of claimant's residual exertional capacity in the record, adequately supported the ALJ's hypothetical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the weight to be given the residual functional capacity assessments of non-examining physicians \"will vary with the circumstances, including the nature of the illness and the information provided the expert.\"  Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 223 (1st Cir. 1981).  Claimant's benefits application, however, was denied at step 4, and at step 4 it is ordinarily claimant's burden, not the Secretary's, to produce evidence to demonstrate that he cannot return to his former work.  Gray v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 369, 375 (1st Cir. 1985).  Since claimant was represented by counsel, there is no justification here for a departure from that rule.  See Currier v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 612 F.2d 594, 598 (1st Cir. 1980).  The onus was on claimant, therefore, to introduce additional residual functional capacity assessments relevant to the step 4 determination.  Claimant having failed to do so, the Secretary was entitled to rely on the assessments of these non-examining physicians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Claimant's Allegations of Pain</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find no error in the ALJ's treatment of claimant's subjective complaints of pain.  The exertional aspects of claimant's pain, associated with claimant's back and leg condition, are covered by our above remarks.  It was partly because of claimant's \"pain or discomfort related to back syndrome\" that the ALJ concluded that claimant faced the exertional limitations the ALJ outlined in her hypothetical to the vocational expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the non-exertional aspects of claimant's pain, we find that the ALJ conducted the kind of inquiry into claimant's allegations of pain required by Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1986), and that the ALJ's decision to discredit allegations of disabling pain was supported by substantial evidence.  The record supports, and claimant has not challenged, the ALJ's findings that claimant \"has been taking medication on his own, has not been going for treatment consistently and he should complain to the treating sources so that corrective action may be undertaken such as prescribe a substitute medication, decreasing the frequency or the dosage of the medication or orienting the claimant in terms of taking medication consistently.\"  The ALJ also permissibly relied on her own observations at the hearing that claimant \"had a cane, but he did not appear to actually need it for support.  He admitted that such cane was not prescribed by any medical source and that he bought it on his own.  He was able to sit, stand up and exercise body control with no significant limitations.\"  This evidence adequately supported the ALJ's finding, as reflected in her hypotheticals to the vocational expert, that claimant did not suffer from significant pain beyond that which contributed to his exertional limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Claimant's Mental Impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deficiency in the Secretary's determination concerns the ALJ's description of claimant's mental impairment in the ALJ's hypothetical to the vocational expert.  The hypothetical merely stated that claimant had a mental condition, without any description of any specific mental impairment or any specific functional consequences.  The hypothetical then went on to list a number of areas in which claimant's mental capabilities were found to be normal.  As claimant argues in his brief on appeal, \"the subject hypothetical having to do with appellant's mental condition poses no mental impairment at all.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical evidence does not permit claimant's mental condition to be ignored in this manner.  Even the psychological evaluation most favorable to the Secretary, that of Dr. Orlando Maldonado Rodriguez conducted on March 7, 1990, found a \"mild anxiety disorder.\"  It did not discuss what, if any, functional limitations that disorder posed.  The two assessments by non-examining agency review physicians of claimant's residual mental capacity, provided by Dr. Reboredo and Dr. Jeanette Maldonado, found that claimant had a severe anxiety-related disorder which imposed \"moderate\" limitations in various functional areas, including the following:  maintaining attention and concentration for extended periods, performing within a schedule, maintaining regular attendance and punctuality, completing a normal work day or week without interruption from psychologically based symptoms, performing at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods, interacting appropriately with the general public, getting along with co-workers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes, and responding appropriately to changes in a work setting.  Of particular relevance, given claimant's past work as a lottery ticket salesman and the ALJ's denial of benefits on the ground that claimant could still perform that job, Dr. Reboredor wrote that claimant \"cannot relate to public ... on a steady basis,\" and Dr. Jeanette Maldonado expressed a similar view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ herself specifically concluded in her decision that claimant has \"some anxiety related disorder although it is mild to moderate in nature,\" and that he could not \"perform ... complex tasks with detailed instructions.\"  The ALJ failed to address, however, what affect the moderate limitations on, for example, dealing with the public and completing a normal workday would have on claimant's ability to perform his past work as a salesman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we recognize that the medical evidence supported the ALJ's finding of a \"mild to moderate\" mental disorder, the hypothetical presented to the ALJ-which effectively described no mental limitation at all-was at odds with the medical evidence and with the ALJ's own finding.  It may be that claimant's former job could be performed by an individual with claimant's \"mild to moderate\" mental impairment.  This court is certainly not qualified to make that determination nor is it clear why the ALJ was entitled to do so in the absence of expert vocational testimony.  Such was not obtained here and, if there is some basis on which the ALJ was justified in disregarding or discounting the medical evidence as to mental disorder, that explanation is not set forth in the ALJ' decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is vacated.

After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) conceded that claimant had a severe impairment or impairments, but concluded that claimant was not disabled at step 4 of the sequential evaluation process, 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1520(e), on the ground that claimant's impairments did not preclude his return to his former job as a lottery ticket vendor.  The ALJ based this determination on the testimony of a vocational expert at the hearing that an individual with claimant's impairments, as described by the ALJ, could perform that job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Appeals Council denied claimant's request for review of the ALJ's decision, claimant appealed to the district court, which affirmed.  On appeal to this court, claimant argues that the Secretary's decision is not supported by substantial evidence.  We agree, and we direct a remand to the Secretary for the taking of additional vocational evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the Secretary's decision under a \"substantial evidence\" standard;  we will affirm that decision if it is supported by \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"  Richardson v.

The ALJ's determination that claimant could perform his past work was based on the vocational expert's answers to hypothetical questions posed by the ALJ.  We must, therefore, examine the soundness of those questions' premises.  If the premises are supported by substantial evidence in the record, then the vocational expert's responses constitute substantial evidence to support the ALJ's vocational determination that claimant's impairment do not preclude his former work.  If the premises lack record support, then the vocational expert's responses are not substantial evidence.  \"[I]n order for a vocational expert's answer to a hypothetical question to be relevant, the inputs into that hypothetical must correspond to conclusions that are supported by the outputs from the medical authorities.\"  Arocho v.
