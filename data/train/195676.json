Respondent Hospital  San Francisco,  Inc.,\n               \n\nthe operator of a hospital in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, seeks\n\npermission to withdraw recognition from the Unidad Laboral de\n\nEnfermeras(os)   y   Empleados   de   la   Salud--the   union\n\nrepresenting  a unit  of registered  nurses at  the hospital.\n\nBased on  the undisputed evidence,  the motion is  denied for\n\nthe following reasons.1\n\n                              I.\n\n     A  brief recounting  of respondent's  bargaining history\n\nwith  the union is necessary  to place the  instant motion in\n\ncontext.  That history includes, among other proceedings, two\n\ndecisions by the National  Labor Relations Board finding that\n\nrespondent  had  committed  unfair  labor  practices,  and  a\n\ndecision  by this  court adjudicating  it in  contempt.   The\n\nbackground is as follows.  Following respondent's acquisition\n\nof  the   hospital  in   December  1987,  the   union  sought\n\nrecognition  by the new owner.   Although the  union had been\n\nrepresenting  the nurses for some ten years up to that point,\n\nrespondent  refused, claiming  that  it was  not a  successor\n\nemployer and that the nurses were probationary employees.  On\n\nDecember  13, 1988,  an  ALJ rejected  these allegations  and\n\nordered  respondent  to bargain  with  the  union; the  Board\n\nadopted  this order  three months  later.   See 293  NLRB 171\n                                               \n\n                    \n\n1.  Neither side has requested reference to a special master,\nand we agree that disposition of the matter can be reached on\nthe basis of the papers presented.\n\n(\"Hospital   I\").     Respondent  recognized   and  commenced\n              \n\nbargaining with the union in the wake of the ALJ's decision.\n\n     Such rapprochement, however, was short-lived.  In August\n\n1989,  respondent  withdrew recognition  from  the union  and\n\nfiled  a decertification  petition, claiming  that  the union\n\nlacked majority  support among  the nurses.   It subsequently\n\nmade unilateral changes in working conditions and declined to\n\nfurnish  the union  with  requested information.   The  union\n\nagain filed charges, and  an ALJ again found that  respondent\n\nhad committed  unfair labor practices.   This decision, dated\n\nDecember  30, 1991, was adopted  by the Board  in April 1992.\n\nSee  307 NLRB 84 (\"Hospital II\").   Mincing no words, the ALJ\n                              \n\nfound  that respondent  \"never had an  intention to  reach an\n\nagreement  with  the  Union,\"  and that  its  \"withdrawal  of\n\nrecognition  and the filing of the  RN petition were pretexts\n\nand shams, the  real purpose  for which was  the delaying  of\n\ncollective bargaining and ultimately the ousting of the Union\n\nfrom the Respondent's premises.\"   307 NLRB  at 87.  The  ALJ\n\nsimilarly  concluded that  respondent's  questioning  of  the\n\nunion's  majority status  was \"spurious.\"   Id..   Respondent\n                                               \n\nnever sought review of Hospital II in this court.2 \n                                  \n\n     In  the  meantime,  prompted  by this  second  round  of\n\ncharges,  the Board  applied for  summary enforcement  of its\n\n                    \n\n2.  Respondent's  decertification  petition,  meanwhile,  was\ndismissed by the Region because of the pendency of the unfair\nlabor practice charges.\n\n                             -3-\n\norder in Hospital  I.   In February  1991, over  respondent's\n                    \n\nobjection,  this  court enforced  the  Board's  order on  the\n\nground that  there was  \"no reasonable expectation\"  that the\n\nwrong  would not be repeated.   We subsequently  noted, in an\n\norder  denying  reconsideration,  that  the  record contained\n\n\"sufficient  intimations ...  of  continued recalcitrance  by\n\nrespondent  concerning its duty to  bargain\" so as to warrant\n\nenforcement of the order.  \n\n     In   July  1992,   the  Board   filed  a   petition  for\n\nadjudication in civil contempt, alleging that respondent  had\n\nviolated the judgment  by unilaterally implementing  a change\n\nin work  schedule and by  dealing directly with  employees in\n\nconnection therewith.  In a decision dated March 30, 1993, we\n\nfound respondent  in contempt.  While  acknowledging that its\n\nconduct  there  was  \"less   than  flagrant  in  nature,\"  we\n\ndetermined that  a  contempt adjudication  was  warranted  in\n\nlight of the hospital's  \"history of intransigence toward the\n\nunion.\"      The   accompanying  purgation   order   directed\n\nrespondent,  inter alia,  to  recognize and  bargain in  good\n                       \n\nfaith with the union.  It also provided:\n\n     The Hospital shall not be heard to contend that the\n     Union  lacks  the  support  of a  majority  of  the\n     bargaining unit at any time within one year of  the\n     date  of   this  adjudication.     Thereafter,  the\n     Hospital  shall not  withdraw recognition  from the\n     Union without the prior approval of this Court.\n\nFifteen months  later, respondent  filed the  instant request\n\nfor  approval to  withdraw recognition--asserting  once again\n\n                             -4-\n\nthat the  union's majority support was  subject to reasonable\n\nquestion.   In the alternative, based on the same allegation,\n\nit asks that an election be ordered.  The Board has submitted\n\na memorandum opposing both requests. \n\n                             II.\n\n     The  governing standards are not in  dispute.3  In order\n\nto overcome the rebuttable presumption of continuing majority\n\nstatus, respondent must demonstrate  \"either (1) the union in\n\nfact no longer enjoy[s] majority support, or (2) the employer\n\nha[s]  a reasonable  'good faith'  doubt, based  on objective\n\nconsiderations, of  the union's  majority support.\"   NLRB v.\n                                                          \n\nLaVerdiere's Enterprises,  933 F.2d  1045, 1051-52 (1st  Cir.\n                        \n\n1991);  accord, e.g.,  NLRB  v.  Curtin Matheson  Scientific,\n                                                             \n\nInc., 494 U.S. 775, 778 (1990); Bolton-Emerson, Inc. v.

An attempt  to withdraw\n\nrecognition  based on such a  good faith doubt  \"must be both\n\nreasonable  and supported by  sufficient objective criteria.\"\n               \n\nDestileria  Serrales, Inc. v. NLRB, 882 F.2d 19, 21 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1989)  (emphasis in  original); accord,  e.g., Soule  Glass &amp;\n                                                             \n\nGlazing Co. v. NLRB, 652 F.2d 1055, 1110 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                   \n\n     In support of its request, respondent cites a panoply of\n\nfactors   that   are  said   to  demonstrate   both  employee\n\n                    \n\n3.  While the  cited  standards derive  from cases  involving\nunfair labor  practice proceedings,  both parties  agree that\nthey   are   equally   applicable   to   the   instant   case\nnotwithstanding its different procedural posture.  \n\n                             -5-\n\nrepudiation of the union and inactivity  on the union's part.\n\nThese can be summarized  as follows: (1) employee expressions\n\nof discontent  with the  union; (2)  the infrequency  of, and\n\npoor attendance  at, union meetings; (3)  the nurses' failure\n\nto  pay  union dues;  (4)  the  filing by  an  employee of  a\n\ndecertification petition in March 1992; (5) a letter from the\n\nunion president  decrying the  lack of employee  support; (6)\n\nthe  union's  failure to  file  grievances;  (7) its  alleged\n\nfailure  to appoint  a  shop  steward;  (8)  the  absence  of\n\nemployees on the union  bargaining committee; (9) the union's\n\noverall inactivity;  and (10) the high  turnover in employees\n\nsince 1987.\n\n     Before addressing these various factors, we take note of\n\nthree general considerations militating against  allowance of\n\nthe instant motion.  First, little of respondent's supporting\n\nevidence  is of recent vintage:  of the five sworn statements\n\nattached to the  motion, three  were prepared in  1989 and  a\n\nfourth in 1990.4  This is significant.  See, e.g., Manna  Pro\n                                                             \n\nPartners,  L.P. v. NLRB, 986 F.2d 1346, 1353 (10th Cir. 1993)\n                       \n\n(employee sentiments voiced in 1984 \"were too remote in time\"\n\nto support  a reasonable doubt  of majority status  in 1990).\n\nSecond,  the  Board  considered  much  of  such  evidence  in\n\nHospital II in the course  of conducting an inquiry identical\n           \n\n                    \n\n4.  Indeed, the three 1989 affidavits were drafted in support\nof respondent's August 1989 decertification petition.\n\n                             -6-\n\nto  that  involved here--i.e.,  in finding  that respondent's\n\n1989 challenge to the  union's majority status was unfounded.\n\nThis, too, is significant.   Cf. NLRB v. Donna-Lee Sportswear\n                                                             \n\nCo.,  836   F.2d  31,  33-34  (1st   Cir.  1987)  (discussing\n   \n\nprinciples  of  issue  preclusion).     Finally,  as   noted,\n\nrespondent was  engaged in unfair labor  practices throughout\n\nmuch of the relevant period.  Indeed, the ALJ in Hospital  II\n                                                             \n\nspecifically found that \"union defection  [was] easily traced\n\nto  the Respondent's  commission of  unfair practices.\"   307\n\nNLRB  at 87.  An  employer, of course,  cannot assert a good-\n\nfaith doubt  as to  a union's majority  support where  unfair\n\nlabor practices have caused  employee defections.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nMedo Photo Supply Corp. v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 678, 687 (1944).\n                               \n\n     Respondent  thus comes  close  to  having three  strikes\n\nagainst it before even  stepping to the plate.   The specific\n\nfactors  it cites, moreover, do  little to advance its cause.\n\nIndeed,   many  require   little   discussion.     The  union\n\npresident's   letter,  for  example,  is  irrelevant;  it  is\n\napparent from the  context that  he was  there lamenting  the\n\nnurses'  reluctance  to  testify in  the  agency  hearings--a\n\nreluctance that is  explicable in light of  the atmosphere of\n\n\"fear\" described  by the  ALJ.   See  307 NLRB  at  87.   The\n                                    \n\nreference  to  the  union's  failure to  file  grievances  is\n\ndisingenuous;  as the  ALJ  noted, respondent  had taken  the\n\nposition  that  it  would  not  discuss  grievances  until  a\n\n                             -7-\n\nbargaining agreement was reached.  Id. at 86 &amp; nn.  8-9.  The\n                                      \n\nallegation  of  general  union  inactivity  is frivolous;  it\n\nsuffices to  note in  this regard  that respondent  has twice\n\nbeen brought up on charges by the union.  \n\n     The  alleged expressions  of employee  disaffection with\n\nthe union are worthy of little weight.  They are all at least\n\nfive years old, they  were deemed unpersuasive by the  ALJ in\n\nHospital  II, see  id. at  86, and  they fall  well  short of\n                      \n\nreflecting  the views of \"at least 50 percent\" of the nursing\n\nworkforce, LaVerdiere's  Enterprises, 933 F.2d at  1053.5  In\n                                    \n\nturn, the alleged absence  of a shop steward, the  absence of\n\nemployees on the bargaining committee, and the infrequency of\n\n(and  alleged poor  attendance at)  union meetings  were each\n\nconsidered by  the ALJ.6   Moreover,  the union  now explains\n\nthat a steward  was in place for part of  1991 and 1992, that\n\nit   purposefully  excluded  employees  from  the  bargaining\n\ncommittee to prevent reprisals,  and that it has communicated\n\n                    \n\n5.  The  June 1994  affidavit  of  Rivera Quintero--the  only\ncurrent affidavit provided--states generally that  the nurses\n\"totally  disregard\"  the union,  but recounts  no individual\nexpressions  of anti-union  sentiment.   Indeed, the  lack of\nupdated  evidence  in this  regard  is  telling, inasmuch  as\n\"[e]xpression of  employee sentiment  against a union  is the\nmost persuasive evidence supporting an employer's good  faith\ndoubt  of  the union's  lack of  majority  status.\"   NLRB v.\n                                                          \nAlbany Steel, Inc., 17 F.3d 564, 570 (2d Cir. 1994).\n                  \n\n6.  The  Rivera Quintero  affidavit refers  to a  more recent\nmeeting, the date of  which is unspecified, which  is alleged\nto have  gone entirely unattended.   The  lack of  supporting\ndetail, however, leaves it unclear whether such a meeting was\neven held. \n\n                             -8-\n\nwith its  members through mailings and  leaflets, rather than\n\nthrough  meetings  at  the  hospital, for  the  same  reason.\n\nRespondent has offered no rebuttal of these explanations.\n\n     The remaining  three  factors  are  likewise  of  little\n\navail.  The employee's decertification petition, we are told,\n\nwas dismissed by the Region because of the pendency of unfair\n\nlabor practice proceedings.   In Asseo  v. Centro Medico  del\n                                                             \n\nTurabo,  900 F.2d  445 (1st  Cir. 1990),  we held  in similar\n      \n\ncircumstances that  such  a petition  \"do[es] not  constitute\n\nsufficient  objective evidence  to  deny recognition  to  the\n\ncertified  bargaining agent.\"   Id.  at  453.   Moreover, the\n                                   \n\npetition there had  been signed  by 35 of  the 79  employees;\n\nhere,  while   the  petition  contained  a   checked-off  box\n\nindicating it was supported by 30%  or more of the nurses, it\n\nwas only signed by a single employee.\n\n     Regarding the issue of union dues, respondent points out\n\nthat no  nurse  has executed  an authorization  to have  dues\n\ndeducted  from his  or  her  paycheck.    Yet  this  evidence\n\nmanifests no  recent diminution  in employee support  for the\n\nunion.   Compare, e.g., NLRB  v. Albany Steel,  Inc., 17 F.3d\n                                                    \n\n564,  570  (2d  Cir.  1994)  (\"where  the  union  has  sought\n\nfinancial  support from  the  members and  received only  one\n\nreply which was resoundingly negative, it is not unreasonable\n\nfor an  employer to  question the union's  majority status\").\n\nIndeed, respondent acknowledges  that it \"has  never deducted\n                                                    \n\n                             -9-\n\nUnion dues  from the  graduate nurses,\" Vazquez  Affid., Exh.\n\n10A,   8 (emphasis added)--quite possibly for the reason that\n\nan  employer  has no  duty  to  do so  in  the  absence of  a\n\ncollective bargaining  agreement.  See, e.g.,  Robbins Door &amp;\n                                                             \n\nSash Co., 260 NLRB 659 (1982).7 \n        \n\n     Finally,  as   to  the  issue  of   employee  turnover,8\n\nwhatever  weight  this  factor might  ordinarily  possess  is\n\ndiminished  where,  as  here,  the  employer  has  unlawfully\n\navoided its bargaining obligation during most of the relevant\n\nperiod.

Respondent Hospital  San Francisco,  Inc.,\n               \n\nthe operator of a hospital in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, seeks\n\npermission to withdraw recognition from the Unidad Laboral de\n\nEnfermeras(os)   y   Empleados   de   la   Salud--the   union\n\nrepresenting  a unit  of registered  nurses at  the hospital.\n\nBased on  the undisputed evidence,  the motion is  denied for\n\nthe following reasons.1\n\n                              I.\n\n     A  brief recounting  of respondent's  bargaining history\n\nwith  the union is necessary  to place the  instant motion in\n\ncontext.  That history includes, among other proceedings, two\n\ndecisions by the National  Labor Relations Board finding that\n\nrespondent  had  committed  unfair  labor  practices,  and  a\n\ndecision  by this  court adjudicating  it in  contempt.   The\n\nbackground is as follows.  Following respondent's acquisition\n\nof  the   hospital  in   December  1987,  the   union  sought\n\nrecognition  by the new owner.   Although the  union had been\n\nrepresenting  the nurses for some ten years up to that point,\n\nrespondent  refused, claiming  that  it was  not a  successor\n\nemployer and that the nurses were probationary employees.  On\n\nDecember  13, 1988,  an  ALJ rejected  these allegations  and\n\nordered  respondent  to bargain  with  the  union; the  Board\n\nadopted  this order  three months  later.   See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span>\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">                                               \n\n                    \n\n1.  Neither side has requested reference to a special master,\nand we agree that disposition of the matter can be reached on\nthe basis of the papers presented.\n\n(\"Hospital   I\").     Respondent  recognized   and  commenced\n              \n\nbargaining with the union in the wake of the ALJ's decision.\n\n     Such rapprochement, however, was short-lived.  In August\n\n1989,  respondent  withdrew recognition  from  the union  and\n\nfiled  a decertification  petition, claiming  that  the union\n\nlacked majority  support among  the nurses.   It subsequently\n\nmade unilateral changes in working conditions and declined to\n\nfurnish  the union  with  requested information.   The  union\n\nagain filed charges, and  an ALJ again found that  respondent\n\nhad committed  unfair labor practices.   This decision, dated\n\nDecember  30, 1991, was adopted  by the Board  in April 1992.\n\nSee  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(\"Hospital II\").   Mincing no words, the ALJ\n                              \n\nfound  that respondent  \"never had an  intention to  reach an\n\nagreement  with  the  Union,\"  and that  its  \"withdrawal  of\n\nrecognition  and the filing of the  RN petition were pretexts\n\nand shams, the  real purpose  for which was  the delaying  of\n\ncollective bargaining and ultimately the ousting of the Union\n\nfrom the Respondent's </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">premises.\"</span>   <span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span>  at <span class=\"page\">87</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  The  ALJ\n\nsimilarly  concluded that  respondent's  questioning  of  the\n\nunion's  majority status  was \"spurious.\"   Id..   Respondent\n                                               \n\nnever sought review of Hospital II in this court.2 \n                                  \n\n     In  the  meantime,  prompted  by this  second  round  of\n\ncharges,  the Board  applied for  summary enforcement  of its\n\n                    \n\n2.  Respondent's  decertification  petition,  meanwhile,  was\ndismissed by the Region because of the pendency of the unfair\nlabor practice charges.\n\n                             -3-\n\norder in Hospital  I.   In February  1991, over  respondent's\n                    \n\nobjection,  this  court enforced  the  Board's  order on  the\n\nground that  there was  \"no reasonable expectation\"  that the\n\nwrong  would not be repeated.   We subsequently  noted, in an\n\norder  denying  reconsideration,  that  the  record contained\n\n\"sufficient  intimations ...  of  continued recalcitrance  by\n\nrespondent  concerning its duty to  bargain\" so as to warrant\n\nenforcement of the order.  \n\n     In   July  1992,   the  Board   filed  a   petition  for\n\nadjudication in civil contempt, alleging that respondent  had\n\nviolated the judgment  by unilaterally implementing  a change\n\nin work  schedule and by  dealing directly with  employees in\n\nconnection therewith.  In a decision dated March 30, 1993, we\n\nfound respondent  in contempt.  While  acknowledging that its\n\nconduct  there  was  \"less   than  flagrant  in  nature,\"  we\n\ndetermined that  a  contempt adjudication  was  warranted  in\n\nlight of the hospital's  \"history of intransigence toward the\n\nunion.\"      The   accompanying  purgation   order   directed\n\nrespondent,  inter alia,  to  recognize and  bargain in  good\n                       \n\nfaith with the union.  It also provided:\n\n     The Hospital shall not be heard to contend that the\n     Union  lacks  the  support  of a  majority  of  the\n     bargaining unit at any time within one year of  the\n     date  of   this  adjudication.     Thereafter,  the\n     Hospital  shall not  withdraw recognition  from the\n     Union without the prior approval of this Court.\n\nFifteen months  later, respondent  filed the  instant request\n\nfor  approval to  withdraw recognition--asserting  once again\n\n                             -4-\n\nthat the  union's majority support was  subject to reasonable\n\nquestion.   In the alternative, based on the same allegation,\n\nit asks that an election be ordered.

First, little of respondent's supporting\n\nevidence  is of recent vintage:  of the five sworn statements\n\nattached to the  motion, three  were prepared in  1989 and  a\n\nfourth in 1990.4  This is significant.
