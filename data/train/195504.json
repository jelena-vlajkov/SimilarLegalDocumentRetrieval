See 21  U.S.C.   841(a)-\n                                            \n\n(1), 18 U.S.C.   2 (1993).   On appeal, he challenges two eviden-\n\ntiary  rulings and the sufficiency  of the evidence.

United States v.  Hernandez, 995\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 307, 310 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,     U.S.    , 114 S.

On June 11, 1992, Cotto  enlisted Tracy Barnwell and\n\nIsrael  Rodriguez  to  accompany him  to  Puerto  Rico  to obtain\n\ncocaine  which Cotto planned to distribute upon his return to New\n\nYork  City.  While in Puerto  Rico, Cotto delivered to Barnwell a\n\nsuitcase containing two kilograms of cocaine, and told him how to\n\nconceal the cocaine for  the return trip.  Cotto  purchased three\n\none-way airline tickets for the return flight to New York,  as he\n\nhad done for the flight to  Puerto Rico.  After a  drug-detection\n\ndog alerted to Barnwell's suitcase at the airport in Puerto Rico,\n\nCotto consented to a search of his own travel bag which was found\n\nto  contain $1,400 in cash, three airline ticket receipts for the\n\nflight from New York to Puerto Rico, and an electronic scale.  As\n\n                                2\n\na  mere  recitation demonstrates,  there  was  ample evidence  to\n\nestablish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  \n\n          Cotto also challenges  two evidentiary rulings normally\n\nsubject  to review  for abuse  of discretion.   United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nRodriguez Alvarado, 985  F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir.  1993).  First, at\n                  \n\ntrial  a United  States  Customs agent  identified  Cotto in  the\n\ncourtroom but testified that Cotto's appearance had changed since\n\nhis  arrest.  Cotto objected solely on the ground that the testi-\n\nmony  was not  relevant.   Second,  the  government introduced  a\n\nphotospread  from  which  another  witness had  made  a  pretrial\n\nidentification of Barnwell, Rodriguez  and Cotto.  Cotto objected\n\non the ground  that his  unkempt appearance, as  depicted in  the\n\nphotospread  (e.g., unshaven; dressed  in a  T-shirt; pony-tail),\n                  \n\nwould  cause unfair  prejudice.   See  Fed. R.  Evid.  403.   The\n                                     \n\ndistrict  court  ruled  that  the photospread  was  not  unfairly\n\nprejudicial.\n\n          With respect to the  customs agent's in-court identifi-\n\ncation testimony, appellant's burden is daunting.  \"[T]he thresh-\n\nold for relevance is very low under Federal Rule of Evidence 401.\n\nEvidence is  relevant under Rule 401  if it has 'any  tendency to\n\nmake the  existence of any  fact that  is of  consequence to  the\n\ndetermination of  the action more probable or  less probable than\n\nit would  be without the evidence.'\"   United States v.  Nason, 9\n                                                              \n\nF.3d 155,  162 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing  Fed. R. Evid. 401), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied,       U.S.      , 114 S.  Ct. 1331 (1994).   The in-court\n                        \n\n                                3\n\nidentification testimony provided highly  probative corroboration\n\nof other  trial  testimony that  a  government witness  had  seen\n\nCotto, Barnwell, and Rodriguez together  at the airport in Puerto\n                                       \n\nRico,  and  that it  was  Cotto's atypical  appearance  which had\n\nattracted the  witness's attention  to the  trio.   Since Cotto's\n\nphysical appearance was no longer the same at trial, the in-court\n\nidentification testimony was probative  of the material fact that\n\nthe person on trial  was the one previously seen  in the presence\n\nof Rodriguez and  Barnwell at the airport.  Cf.  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nHolmes,  632 F.2d 167, 169  (1st Cir. 1980)  (holding that photo-\n      \n\ngraph  of  defendant taken  at time  of  arrest is  admissible to\n\ndemonstrate changed appearance at time of trial).1\n\n          The Rule  403 challenge can succeed only  if the proba-\n\ntive value of the photospread was substantially outweighed by the\n\ndanger, inter alia,  of \"unfair  prejudice.\"  See  Fed.

R. Evid. 401.\nOn appeal, however,  Cotto attempts  to assert a  claim of  error\nunder Fed.  R. Evid. 403.  As  the latter claim of  error was not\npreserved below, see Fed.  R. Evid. 103(a), we review  for \"plain\n                    \nerror\" only, see  id. 103(d).   United States  v. Castiello,  915\n                                                           \nF.2d 1, 3-4 (1st  Cir. 1990) (failure to assert  proper objection\nat  trial calls for \"plain error\" review), cert. denied, 498 U.S.\n                                                       \n1068 (1991).   Careful review  reveals that  no unfair  prejudice\nresulted  from  the  admission  of  the  in-court  identification\ntestimony.   See Holmes, 632  F.2d at  169.  Thus,  there was  no\n                       \nerror, plain or otherwise.\n\n                                4\n\n1993).2     The  photospread  provided  probative  circumstantial\n\nevidence that Cotto  had been seen  at the hotel  in Puerto  Rico\n\nwhere Rodriguez and Barnwell stayed before the three were arrest-\n\ned at the airport.  Though its admission hampered Cotto's defense\n\nby tying  all three  codefendants together,  there was  no unfair\n                                                                 \n\nprejudice.  See  Onujiogu v.

On June 11, 1992, Cotto enlisted Tracy Barnwell and Israel Rodriguez to accompany him to Puerto Rico to obtain cocaine which Cotto planned to distribute upon his return to New York City.  While in Puerto Rico, Cotto delivered to Barnwell a suitcase containing two kilograms of cocaine, and told him how to conceal the cocaine for the return trip.  Cotto purchased three one-way airline tickets for the return flight to New York, as he had done for the flight to Puerto Rico.  After a drug-detection dog alerted to Barnwell's suitcase at the airport in Puerto Rico, Cotto consented to a search of his own travel bag which was found to contain $1,400 in cash, three airline ticket receipts for the flight from New York to Puerto Rico, and an electronic scale.  As a mere recitation demonstrates, there was ample evidence to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto also challenges two evidentiary rulings normally subject to review for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Rodriguez Alvarado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599287\"><a href=\"/opinion/599287/united-states-v-jorge-l-rodriguez-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1993).  First, at trial a United States Customs agent identified Cotto in the courtroom but testified that Cotto's appearance had changed since his arrest.  Cotto objected solely on the ground that the testimony was not relevant.  Second, the government introduced a photospread from which another witness had made a pretrial identification of Barnwell, Rodriguez and Cotto.  Cotto objected on the ground that his unkempt appearance, as depicted in the photospread (e.g., unshaven;  dressed in a T-shirt;  pony-tail), would cause unfair prejudice.  See Fed.R.Evid. 403.  The district court ruled that the photospread was not unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the customs agent's in-court identification testimony, appellant's burden is daunting.  \"[T]he threshold for relevance is very low under Federal Rule of Evidence 401.  Evidence is relevant under Rule 401 if it has 'any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' \"  United States v. Nason, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195001\"><a href=\"/opinion/195001/united-states-v-nason/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 162 (1st Cir.1993) (citing Fed.R.Evid. 401), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span> </span>(1994).  The in-court identification testimony provided highly probative corroboration of other trial testimony that a government witness had seen Cotto, Barnwell, and Rodriguez together at the airport in Puerto Rico, and that it was Cotto's atypical appearance which had attracted the witness's attention to the trio.  Since Cotto's physical appearance was no longer the same at trial, the in-court identification testimony was probative of the material fact that the person on trial was the one previously seen in the presence of Rodriguez and Barnwell at the airport.  Cf. United States v. Holmes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382756\"><a href=\"/opinion/382756/united-states-v-william-alton-holmes/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 169 (1st Cir.1980) (holding that photograph of defendant taken at time of arrest is admissible to demonstrate changed appearance at time of trial).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rule 403 challenge can succeed only if the probative value of the photospread was substantially outweighed by the danger, inter alia, of \"unfair prejudice.\"   See Fed.R.Evid. 403;  United States v. Carty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607110\"><a href=\"/opinion/607110/united-states-v-ralph-h-carty/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1011 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The photospread provided probative circumstantial evidence that Cotto had been seen at the hotel in Puerto Rico where Rodriguez and Barnwell stayed before the three were arrested at the airport.  Though its admission hampered Cotto's defense by tying all three codefendants together, there was no unfair prejudice.  See Onujiogu v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487236\"><a href=\"/opinion/487236/anne-onujiogu-etc-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1987) (\"The fact that a piece of evidence hurts a party's chances does not mean it should automatically be excluded, [or] there would be precious little left in the way of probative evidence in any case.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there was no reversible error, the judgment of conviction and sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record reflects that the only objection made to this testimony at trial was based exclusively on Fed.R.Evid. 401.  On appeal, however, Cotto attempts to assert a claim of error under Fed.R.Evid. 403.  As the latter claim of error was not preserved below, see Fed.R.Evid. 103(a), we review for \"plain error\" only, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487236\"><a href=\"/opinion/487236/anne-onujiogu-etc-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> 103(d).
