For ten years he worked as a machinist, primarily in HC's\n\nmachine shop at Holbrook,  Massachusetts.  Throughout his employ-\n\nment as a machinist  he consistently earned favorable performance\n\nreviews.   He  was  promoted twice,  receiving commensurate  wage\n\nincreases from $5.28 per  hour as a Machinist Trainee,  to $11.75\n\nper hour as a Machinist B.\n\n          In December  1990,  at  age  fifty-seven,  Woodman  was\n\ntransferred to the \"bowl department\" in Braintree, Massachusetts,\n\nwhere HC manufactures disposable components for medical equipment\n\ndesigned to  facilitate the collection, separation  and cleansing\n\nof blood and blood constituents.   The medical equipment manufac-\n\ntured in the  bowl department is fabricated under  sterile condi-\n\ntions in a controlled-access area known as the \"clean room.\"\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The essential facts are recited in the light most favorable\nto  appellant  Woodman,  the party  resisting  summary  judgment.\nVelez-Gomez  v. SMA Life Assurance Co., 8 F.3d 873, 874 (1st Cir.\r                                                \n1993).\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          On  January  24,  1991,  Woodman  received  a  flawless\n\nperformance  report from  his  bowl  department supervisor,  Mary\n\nLeBlanc.  Not only did he earn the highest possible rating in all\n\nsix review categories, but LeBlanc commented:  \"[Y]our work since\n\njoining bowls has  been exceptional.   You have  made a  positive\n\ncontribution in work and in adapting to change.\"\n\n          Thereafter,  in  late  March  1991,  Mary  LeBlanc  was\n\nsucceeded by  Rick  Lucas as  Woodman's  supervisor in  the  bowl\n\ndepartment.   Lucas  began training  Woodman in  two non-assembly\n\nline tasks    \"material handling\" (i.e., retrieving raw materials\n\nfor  use in the clean  room) and \"bowl  packing\" (i.e., packaging\n\nthe finished product).  The record discloses but  one performance\n\nreview  of Woodman  by Lucas,  in late  July 1991.    Though less\n\nfavorable  than the  LeBlanc report,  the Lucas  report indicated\n\nthat  Woodman was performing at an acceptable level.  Woodman was\n\nrated \"exceptional\" in terms of dependability and \"above average\"\n\nin terms of both customer/supplier relations and quality of work.\n\nIn no category did Woodman receive a rating lower than \"average.\"\n\nLucas added, \"Frank is a highly organized, consistent performer.\"\n\n          John Barr became Vice President of Operations for HC in\n\nmid-September  1991.   Shortly thereafter,  Barr directed  all HC\n\nmanagers to reevaluate their  employees, with particular emphasis\n\non  flexibility (i.e.,  susceptibility to  cross-training and  to\n\nmultiple production-line responsibilities), reliability, partici-\n\npation (i.e., the capacity  to provide suggestions and contribute\n\nto improved operational efficiencies) and quality and quantity of\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nwork product.  The  record on appeal  does not reflect a  perfor-\n\nmance  rating  on Woodman  under  Vice  President Barr's  revised\n\nperformance review procedure in the fall of 1991.   The record is\n\nclear, however,  that many  HC employees did  receive performance\n\nratings  considered unacceptable  by Barr.   The  record evidence\n\nalso discloses that Barr  determined that HC could terminate  its\n\n\"C performers\" without jeopardizing its production, while dramat-\n\nically reducing labor costs. \n\n          Sometime in the fall of  1991, Mary LeBlanc resumed her\n\nsupervisory  role over  Woodman in the  bowl department.   Around\n\nthis same time,  LeBlanc was  privy to at  least one  discussion,\n\namong members of HC's upper management, in which  future employee\n\nterminations were discussed.   Following such  a meeting, and  in\n\nthe  presence  of  Woodman,  LeBlanc  referenced  the  management\n\ndiscussion relating  to future terminations:   \"These damn people\n\n    they want younger people here.   They will be the one[s] that\n\nwill  be  successful here.\"    Woodman's  affidavit attests  that\n\nLeBlanc made similar statements on several occasions.  \n\n          During the time that HC's management was deciding which\n\nemployees were to  be terminated, Mary LeBlanc  submitted a memo-\n\nrandum,  dated  November  15,  1991,  describing  Woodman's  work\n\nperformance as  having been unsatisfactory throughout  the period\n\n\"since  July 1991.\"  The November 15 memorandum made no reference\n\nto the performance review  by Lucas in late  July 1991.   LeBlanc\n\ndescribed Woodman as an \"unmotivated worker\" who \"would prefer to\n\nsit in the Bowl Prep  area and read for extended periods  of time\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nup to several  hours.\"  She noted further  that Woodman was slow,\n\nroutinely  requiring a minimum of thirty minutes to dress for the\n\nsterile  conditions  in the  clean  room,  whereas the  requisite\n\nprocedures  should  take no  longer  than ten  minutes.   LeBlanc\n\nreported that  Woodman possessed  limited skills:   \"Frank cannot\n\nperform 50% of line  operations to standard requirement.   He can\n\nonly be assigned  2 off line  jobs in the  clean room, where  his\n\nperformance will not affect production quantities.\"  Furthermore,\n\nshe  stated, despite  Woodman's  training  on most  assembly-line\n\noperations,  his  inability  to  perform those  operations  in  a\n\nsatisfactory manner had led to  the abandonment of further train-\n\ning  efforts.  LeBlanc concluded:  \"I recommend Frank be relieved\n\nfrom his current duties.\"  \n\n          Five  days  later, in  a  reduction  in force  (\"RIF\"),\n\nthirty-three  HC  employees  were terminated;  twelve,  including\n\nWoodman, were bowl department  employees.  HC presented statisti-\n\ncal evidence  demonstrating that  the ratio of  older to  younger\n\nemployees in  the bowl  department increased slightly  during the\n\nreduction in  force; viz., 41%  over age  40 before the  RIF; 44%\r                                  \n\nafter the RIF.2  \n\n          Woodman  received  written   notice  of  his  immediate\n\ntermination on  November 20,  which advised  that HC had  decided\n\nthat  it could \"eliminate a  group of its  poorest performers and\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     2However,  since the company-wide  data neither  support nor\r                                                \nundermine  the  contention that  the  RIF  had no  discriminatory\nimpact,  additional  information  would  be needed  to  draw  any\npertinent conclusion from these data. \n\n                                5\r\r\n\nstill  meet  the production  plan.\"   Later,  HC reported  to the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Employment  Training that Woodman was\n\ndischarged as part of a reduction in force involving the company-\n\n's \"poorest performers.\"  On March 2, 1993, Woodman initiated the\n\npresent suit in federal  district court, alleging age discrimina-\n\ntion in violation of the ADEA.  \n\n          In due course, the statement attributed to Mary LeBlanc\n\nby the Woodman  affidavit submitted in opposition to  HC's motion\n\nfor  summary  judgment was  excluded  by  the district  court  as\n\ninadmissible \"totem-pole\" (i.e.,  multiple) hearsay,  \"unavailing\r                                         \n\non a motion for summary judgment.\"  The court went on to conclude\n\nthat though Woodman  had made out a prima facie  case of age dis-\n\ncrimination, HC had rebutted  the resulting presumption of unlaw-\n\nful age discrimination by producing enough evidence, if credited,\n\nto  enable a rational trier  of fact to  find a nondiscriminatory\n\nbasis  for  Woodman's  dismissal; viz.,  poor  work  performance.\r                                               \n\nUltimately,  the district court awarded summary judgment to HC on\n\nthe  ground that  Woodman  had not  proffered competent  evidence\n\nsufficient to  generate a trialworthy issue as  to whether imper-\n\nmissible  age-based  discrimination  constituted a  determinative\n\nfactor in the dismissal.  Woodman appealed.\n\n                                II\r                                          II\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \n\n          We examine a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing\r                                                                  \n\nthe  evidence, and  all reasonable  inferences therefrom,  in the\n\nlight  most favorable  to the  party resisting  summary judgment.\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nO'Connor  v.

At  age  fifty-seven, Woodman  was\n\ndischarged as part of a reduction in force, while younger persons\n\nwere retained in the bowl  department.  See Goldman, 985 F.2d  at\r                                                             \n\n1117.  As the district court noted, the only substantial question\n\nwas whether Woodman had met the employer's legitimate job-perfor-\n\nmance expectations.  Woodman cleared this hurdle with his proffer\n\nof substantial wage  increases and ten years  of positive perfor-\n\nmance reviews, blemished by  but one negative performance evalua-\n\ntion five  days prior  to  the reduction  in force.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \n\nWoods,  30 F.3d at 261 (history  of largely favorable performance\r               \n\nreviews and extensive experience in industry adequate to generate\n\nat  least a genuine  issue as to  plaintiff-employee's ability to\n\nmeet  legitimate  job expectations);  Keisling,  19  F.3d at  760\r                                                        \n\n(similar).

Id.  \r                                \n\n          First,  Woodman attacked the  final performance evalua-\n\ntion by Mary LeBlanc on November 15, 1991    five days before the\n\nreduction in  force     by contrasting the  laudatory performance\n\nreview of January 24,  1991, with the  final review    less  than\n\nnine months later    in which LeBlanc's assessment plummeted from\n\nhigh praise to a  recommendation that Woodman be relieved  of his\n\ncurrent duties.   The Woodman affidavit itself attested  to facts\n\n                                12\r\r\n\ndirectly contradicting several key  assertions made by LeBlanc in\n\nher final work  performance evaluation.  He  also tendered state-\n\nments from a former supervisor  in the machine shop and a  former\n\ngroup leader  in  the  bowl department,  attesting  to  the  high\n\nquality of his work.   Second, and most importantly,  the Woodman\n\naffidavit asserted  that Mary LeBlanc had stated in his presence,\n\nfollowing  a  meeting with  upper  management  shortly before  HC\n\nimplemented its reduction in  force:  \"These damn people     they\n\nwant younger people  here.  They will be the  one[s] that will be\n\nsuccessful here.\"  \n\n          Under  the summary judgment  analysis required once the\n\nMcDonnell  Douglas  framework dropped  out  of  the picture,  see\r                                                                           \n\nHicks, 113 S.

Thus,  Woodman's  evidence,  including  the\n\nvicarious admission made  through LeBlanc     if credited by  the\n\nfactfinder    would be  adequate not only to permit  a reasonable\r                                                             \n\ninference  that  HC's  articulated  justification  for  Woodman's\n\ndismissal was a mere  pretext for intentional age discrimination,\n\nbut also to generate a grave \"suspicion  of mendacity\" respecting\n\nthe  highly unfavorable  performance rating  made in  the LeBlanc\n\nmemorandum five days  prior to Woodman's  dismissal.

Thus, the\n\ncircumstantial  evidence  proffered  in  the   Woodman  affidavit\n\nprovided  a  plainly sufficient  foundation,  see  Fed. R.  Evid.\r                                                           \n\n103(a)(2), for finding both that LeBlanc was directly involved in\n\nthe reduction in force and  that the excluded statement concerned\n\nmatters within the scope of her employment.  Indeed, any contrary\n\nsuggestion  is belied by HC's  firm reliance on LeBlanc's adverse\n\nperformance  evaluation as  the principal  justification  for its\n\ndecision  to  terminate  Woodman.   Finally,  the  circumstantial\n\nevidence  proffered in  the  Woodman affidavit  attests, and  the\n\nexcluded statement itself reflects,  that LeBlanc purported to be\n\ncommunicating to  Woodman information acquired at  the HC manage-\n\nment meeting.\n\n          We conclude  that  though  the  Woodman  affidavit  may\r                                                                           \n\nreflect that  LeBlanc's description  of HC management's  attitude\n\ntoward older workers  was predicated on  more than one  statement\n\nmade at the management meeting in LeBlanc's  presence, her state-\n\nment  to Woodman  was not  hearsay, even  though offered  for its\n\ntruth.

For ten years he worked as a machinist, primarily in HC's machine shop at Holbrook, Massachusetts.  Throughout his employment as a machinist he consistently earned favorable performance reviews.  He was promoted twice, receiving commensurate wage increases from $5.28 per hour as a Machinist Trainee, to $11.75 per hour as a Machinist B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1990, at age fifty-seven, Woodman was transferred to the \"bowl department\" in Braintree, Massachusetts, where HC manufactures disposable components for medical equipment designed to facilitate the collection, separation and cleansing of blood and blood constituents.  The medical equipment manufactured in the bowl department is fabricated under sterile conditions in a controlled-access area known as the \"clean room.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 1991, Woodman received a flawless performance report from his bowl department supervisor, Mary LeBlanc.  Not only did he earn the highest possible rating in all six review categories, but LeBlanc commented:  \"[Y]our work since joining bowls has been exceptional.  You have made a positive contribution in work and in adapting to change.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in late March 1991, Mary LeBlanc was succeeded by Rick Lucas as Woodman's supervisor in the bowl department.  Lucas began training Woodman in two non-assembly line tasks--\"material handling\" (i.e., retrieving raw materials for use in the clean room) and \"bowl packing\" (i.e., packaging the finished product).  The record discloses but one performance review of Woodman by Lucas, in late July 1991.  Though less favorable than the LeBlanc report, the Lucas report indicated that Woodman was performing at an acceptable level.  Woodman was rated \"exceptional\" in terms of dependability and \"above average\" in terms of both customer/supplier relations and quality of work.  In no category did Woodman receive a rating lower than \"average.\"   Lucas added, \"Frank is a highly organized, consistent performer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Barr became Vice President of Operations for HC in mid-September 1991.  Shortly thereafter, Barr directed all HC managers to reevaluate their employees, with particular emphasis on flexibility (i.e., susceptibility to cross-training and to multiple production-line responsibilities), reliability, participation (i.e., the capacity to provide suggestions and contribute to improved operational efficiencies) and quality and quantity of work product.  The record on appeal does not reflect a performance rating on Woodman under Vice President Barr's revised performance review procedure in the fall of 1991.  The record is clear, however, that many HC employees did receive performance ratings considered unacceptable by Barr.  The record evidence also discloses that Barr determined that HC could terminate its \"C performers\" without jeopardizing its production, while dramatically reducing labor costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in the fall of 1991, Mary LeBlanc resumed her supervisory role over Woodman in the bowl department.  Around this same time, LeBlanc was privy to at least one discussion, among members of HC's upper management, in which future employee terminations were discussed.  Following such a meeting, and in the presence of Woodman, LeBlanc referenced the management discussion relating to future terminations:  \"These damn people--they want younger people here.  They will be the one[s] that will be successful here.\"   Woodman's affidavit attests that LeBlanc made similar statements on several occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the time that HC's management was deciding which employees were to be terminated, Mary LeBlanc submitted a memorandum, dated November 15, 1991, describing Woodman's work performance as having been unsatisfactory throughout the period \"since July 1991.\"   The November 15 memorandum made no reference to the performance review by Lucas in late July 1991.  LeBlanc described Woodman as an \"unmotivated worker\" who \"would prefer to sit in the Bowl Prep area and read for extended periods of time up to several hours.\"   She noted further that Woodman was slow, routinely requiring a minimum of thirty minutes to dress for the sterile conditions in the clean room, whereas the requisite procedures should take no longer than ten minutes.  LeBlanc reported that Woodman possessed limited skills:  \"Frank cannot perform 50% of line operations to standard requirement.  He can only be assigned 2 off line jobs in the clean room, where his performance will not affect production quantities.\"   Furthermore, she stated, despite Woodman's training on most assembly-line operations, his inability to perform those operations in a satisfactory manner had led to the abandonment of further training efforts.  LeBlanc concluded:  \"I recommend Frank be relieved from his current duties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days later, in a reduction in force (\"RIF\"), thirty-three HC employees were terminated;  twelve, including Woodman, were bowl department employees.  HC presented statistical evidence demonstrating that the ratio of older to younger employees in the bowl department increased slightly during the reduction in force;  viz., 41% over age 40 before the RIF;  44% after the RIF.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodman received written notice of his immediate termination on November 20, which advised that HC had decided that it could \"eliminate a group of its poorest performers and still meet the production plan.\"   Later, HC reported to the Massachusetts Department of Employment Training that Woodman was discharged as part of a reduction in force involving the company's \"poorest performers.\"   On March 2, 1993, Woodman initiated the present suit in federal district court, alleging age discrimination in violation of the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the statement attributed to Mary LeBlanc by the Woodman affidavit submitted in opposition to HC's motion for summary judgment was excluded by the district court as inadmissible \"totem-pole\" (i.e., multiple) hearsay, \"unavailing on a motion for summary judgment.\"   The court went on to conclude that though Woodman had made out a prima facie case of age discrimination, HC had rebutted the resulting presumption of unlawful age discrimination by producing enough evidence, if credited, to enable a rational trier of fact to find a nondiscriminatory basis for Woodman's dismissal;  viz., poor work performance.  Ultimately, the district court awarded summary judgment to HC on the ground that Woodman had not proffered competent evidence sufficient to generate a trialworthy issue as to whether impermissible age-based discrimination constituted a determinative factor in the dismissal.  Woodman appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the evidence, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party resisting summary judgment.

Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir.1993);  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842.   The required prima facie showing is not especially burdensome, see Greenberg v. Union Camp Corp., 48 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.1995);  Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., 40 F.3d 11, 15 n. 4 (1st Cir.1994), and once established, gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the employer engaged in intentional age-based discrimination.  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117 (citing Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254, 101 S.Ct. at 1094).   As Justice Scalia stated in Hicks, the rebuttable presumption ultimately results in \"a required conclusion [viz., unlawful discrimination] in the absence of explanation.\"  Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2747 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second stage in the burden-shifting praxis, the defendant-employer must produce sufficient competent evidence, \"taken as true,\" to permit a rational factfinder to conclude that there was a \"nondiscriminatory reason,\" id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2748 (emphasis in original), for the challenged employment action, thereby displacing the legal presumption of intentional discrimination generated by the plaintiff-employee's prima facie case.  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117.   Since neither credibility issues nor other factual matters in genuine dispute are to be resolved under it, \"the McDonnell Douglas framework ... is no longer relevant\" once the defendant-employer has met its burden of production at the second stage.  Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749.   The attendant legal presumption of intentional discrimination having served its purpose--that of \"forcing the defendant to come forward with some response\"--it \"drops out of the picture.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, the defendant-employer's motion for summary judgment cannot succeed if the plaintiff-employee, with whom the ultimate burden of persuasion remains throughout, Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 478 (1st Cir.1993), has proffered sufficient admissible evidence, if believed, to prove by a preponderance of the evidence each essential element in a prima facie case and that the employer's justification for the challenged employment action was merely a pretext for impermissible age discrimination.  Id. at 479.   The plaintiff-employee may rely upon the same evidence to establish both pretext and discrimination, provided it is adequate to enable a rational factfinder reasonably to infer that intentional age-based discrimination was a determinative factor in the adverse employment action.  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117-18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the elements of a sufficient prima facie case combine with the factfinder's belief that the ostensible basis for dismissing the employee was pretextual, \"particularly if ... accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity,\" the factfinder is permitted to infer the intentional age-based discrimination required to enable the plaintiff-employee to prevail on the merits.  Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749 (\"The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\")  (emphasis added);  Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255, 260 n. 3 (1st Cir.1994).  We conclude that Woodman made out just such a case in the district court, thereby precluding summary judgment for HC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Woodman's Prima Facie Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly concluded that Woodman had established a prima facie case of impermissible age-based discrimination in employment.  At age fifty-seven, Woodman was discharged as part of a reduction in force, while younger persons were retained in the bowl department.  See Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117.   As the district court noted, the only substantial question was whether Woodman had met the employer's legitimate job-performance expectations.  Woodman cleared this hurdle with his proffer of substantial wage increases and ten years of positive performance reviews, blemished by but one negative performance evaluation five days prior to the reduction in force.  See, e.g., Woods, 30 F.3d at 261 (history of largely favorable performance reviews and extensive experience in industry adequate to generate at least a genuine issue as to plaintiff-employee's ability to meet legitimate job expectations);  Keisling, 19 F.3d at 760 (similar).  It then became incumbent upon HC to rebut the resulting legal presumption that the determining factor in its decision to discharge Woodman was impermissible age-based discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. HC's Rebuttal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second stage in the McDonnell Douglas analysis, the district court concluded--again correctly--that HC had rebutted the legal presumption of intentional age discrimination with evidence relating to Woodman's work performance since joining the bowl department.  See Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2748 (\"By producing evidence (whether ultimately persuasive or not) of nondiscriminatory reasons, [defendants] sustained their burden of production....\").  Crediting the competent evidence adduced by HC, see id., Woodman's performance in the machine shop may have been very good, but he never mastered the tasks required in the bowl department.  Thus, the presumption of unlawful age discrimination vanished from the case.  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749;  Vega, 3 F.3d at 479.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to avoid summary judgment at that point it was essential that Woodman proffer sufficient competent evidence to generate a trialworthy issue on the ultimate question whether intentional age-based discrimination was a determinative factor in his dismissal.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Woodman attacked the final performance evaluation by Mary LeBlanc on November 15, 1991--five days before the reduction in force--by contrasting the laudatory performance review of January 24, 1991, with the final review--less than nine months later--in which LeBlanc's assessment plummeted from high praise to a recommendation that Woodman be relieved of his current duties.  The Woodman affidavit itself attested to facts directly contradicting several key assertions made by LeBlanc in her final work performance evaluation.  He also tendered statements from a former supervisor in the machine shop and a former group leader in the bowl department, attesting to the high quality of his work.  Second, and most importantly, the Woodman affidavit asserted that Mary LeBlanc had stated in his presence, following a meeting with upper management shortly before HC implemented its reduction in force:  \"These damn people--they want younger people here.  They will be the one[s] that will be successful here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the summary judgment analysis required once the McDonnell Douglas framework dropped out of the picture, see Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749, the district court was required to consider whether Woodman presented sufficient competent, i.e., admissible, evidence, see Murphy v. Timberlane Regional Sch. Dist., 22 F.3d 1186, 1196 (1st Cir.)  (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 484, 130 L.Ed.2d 396 (1994), to warrant a trial on the ultimate question whether unlawful age-based discrimination was a determinative factor in his dismissal by HC.  It was at this juncture that the district court excluded the linchpin in Woodman's opposition to summary judgment--the vicarious admission that Woodman attributed to LeBlanc--as inadmissible \"totem-pole\" hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Woodman's Demonstration of Pretext</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The twofold thrust implicit in the evidentiary proffers made by Woodman was that the November 15, 1991, LeBlanc memorandum severely denigrating his work performance was a pretext for unlawful age-based discrimination on the part of HC, as indicated not only by Woodman's own work-performance evidence but by the vicarious HC admission, through LeBlanc, that new management disfavored older employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factfinding inquiry into pretext focuses on \"whether the employer believed its stated reason to be credible.\"  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1118 (quoting Mesnick v. General Electric Co., 950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir.1991)) (emphasis added).  Thus, Woodman's evidence, including the vicarious admission made through LeBlanc--if credited by the factfinder--would be adequate not only to permit a reasonable inference that HC's articulated justification for Woodman's dismissal was a mere pretext for intentional age discrimination, but also to generate a grave \"suspicion of mendacity\" respecting the highly unfavorable performance rating made in the LeBlanc memorandum five days prior to Woodman's dismissal.  See Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Consequently, the putative vicarious admission by HC, through LeBlanc, is crucial to our de novo determination whether HC was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.  See Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) The Vicarious Admission</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, HC argues that the excluded statement does not come within Evidence Rule 801(d)(2)(D) because LeBlanc was only a \"first-line\" supervisor, with no authority to make termination decisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  However that may be, Rule 801(d)(2)(D) does not contemplate--as HC seems to suppose--that the statement be shown to have been made by the employee at the instance of her employer, compare Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(C) with Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D), but only that the declarant's statement concern matters within the scope of her agency or employment.  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).  See, e.g., Union Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 793 F.2d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.1986);  Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1262 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects that LeBlanc was acting within the scope of her employment in (i) attending the HC management meeting, (ii) assessing the performance of bowl department employees under her supervision (including Woodman), and (iii) in recommending that Woodman be relieved from his duties.  Thus, the circumstantial evidence proffered in the Woodman affidavit provided a plainly sufficient foundation, see Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2), for finding both that LeBlanc was directly involved in the reduction in force and that the excluded statement concerned matters within the scope of her employment.  Indeed, any contrary suggestion is belied by HC's firm reliance on LeBlanc's adverse performance evaluation as the principal justification for its decision to terminate Woodman.  Finally, the circumstantial evidence proffered in the Woodman affidavit attests, and the excluded statement itself reflects, that LeBlanc purported to be communicating to Woodman information acquired at the HC management meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that though the Woodman affidavit may reflect that LeBlanc's description of HC management's attitude toward older workers was predicated on more than one statement made at the management meeting in LeBlanc's presence, her statement to Woodman was not hearsay, even though offered for its truth.  See Hybert v. Hearst Corp., 900 F.2d 1050, 1053 (7th Cir.1990) (finding no error where trial court, in ADEA action, admitted into evidence the statement--made by manager to subordinate--that \"it's a concern of some of the guys in New York that some of our people in their sixties are going to be replaced\");  see also Brookover v. Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hosp., 893 F.2d 411, 417-18 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that nurses' statements that bed restraints should have been used on patient were made within scope of nurses' employment);  Union Mut. Life Ins. Co., 793 F.2d at 8-9 (holding that statement by lower level accountant, charged with preparing billings relating to employer's leases, concerned matter within scope of accountant's employment, in circumstances where information upon which proffered statement was based was located in file in accountant's possession within the scope of employment).  Accordingly, the evidentiary ruling constituted an abuse of discretion, as it was based upon a misapplication of Rule 801(d)(2)(D) and resulted in a denial of Woodman's right to trial on the ADEA claim.  See Siegal v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., 921 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational factfinder could conclude that the erroneously excluded non-hearsay statement attributed to Mary LeBlanc provided cogent evidence probative not only of pretext and impermissible age-based discrimination on the part of HC, see Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117-18 (plaintiff-employee may rely on same evidence to prove both pretext and discrimination), but also of the untruthfulness of the LeBlanc performance review immediately preceding Woodman's dismissal.  See Hicks, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749.   We express no view whatever on these credibility issues, of course, except to note that at summary judgment such questions were to be resolved in favor of Woodman.  See Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 877.   HC was not entitled to summary judgment, given the competent evidentiary proffer that its articulated reason for discharging Woodman was an untruthful pretext for intentional age-based discrimination.  See Hicks, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2749.   Consequently, the district court judgment must be vacated and the ADEA claim must be remanded for factfinding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is vacated.

See Healy v. New York Life Ins. Co., 860 F.2d 1209, 1217 (3d Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1098, 109 S.Ct. 2449, 104 L.Ed.2d 1004 (1989) (disparate treatment claim);  see also Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 454, 102 S.Ct. 2525, 2534, 73 L.Ed.2d 130 (1982) (\"[A] nondiscriminatory 'bottom line' and an employer's good-faith efforts to achieve a nondiscriminatory work force, might in some cases assist an employer in rebutting the inference that particular action had been intentionally discriminatory.\").  But by itself, rarely will an employer's statistical evidence relating to company-wide workforce composition provide a conclusive defense against a disparate treatment discrimination claim at summary judgment where the employee has established a prima facie case and pretext accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity.  See Healy, 860 F.2d at 1218 (expressing skepticism concerning conclusiveness of employer's uncontested data showing no change in workforce composition, both department-wide and company-wide, after reduction in force);  see also Furnco Constr.

For ten years he worked as a machinist, primarily in HC's machine shop at Holbrook, Massachusetts.  Throughout his employment as a machinist he consistently earned favorable performance reviews.  He was promoted twice, receiving commensurate wage increases from $5.28 per hour as a Machinist Trainee, to $11.75 per hour as a Machinist B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1990, at age fifty-seven, Woodman was transferred to the \"bowl department\" in Braintree, Massachusetts, where HC manufactures disposable components for medical equipment designed to facilitate the collection, separation and cleansing of blood and blood constituents.  The medical equipment manufactured in the bowl department is fabricated under sterile conditions in a controlled-access area known as the \"clean room.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 1991, Woodman received a flawless performance report from his bowl department supervisor, Mary LeBlanc.  Not only did he earn the highest possible rating in all six review categories, but LeBlanc commented:  \"[Y]our work since joining bowls has been exceptional.  You have made a positive contribution in work and in adapting to change.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in late March 1991, Mary LeBlanc was succeeded by Rick Lucas as Woodman's supervisor in the bowl department.  Lucas began training Woodman in two non-assembly line tasks--\"material handling\" (i.e., retrieving raw materials for use in the clean room) and \"bowl packing\" (i.e., packaging the finished product).  The record discloses but one performance review of Woodman by Lucas, in late July 1991.  Though less favorable than the LeBlanc report, the Lucas report indicated that Woodman was performing at an acceptable level.  Woodman was rated \"exceptional\" in terms of dependability and \"above average\" in terms of both customer/supplier relations and quality of work.  In no category did Woodman receive a rating lower than \"average.\"   Lucas added, \"Frank is a highly organized, consistent performer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Barr became Vice President of Operations for HC in mid-September 1991.  Shortly thereafter, Barr directed all HC managers to reevaluate their employees, with particular emphasis on flexibility (i.e., susceptibility to cross-training and to multiple production-line responsibilities), reliability, participation (i.e., the capacity to provide suggestions and contribute to improved operational efficiencies) and quality and quantity of work product.  The record on appeal does not reflect a performance rating on Woodman under Vice President Barr's revised performance review procedure in the fall of 1991.  The record is clear, however, that many HC employees did receive performance ratings considered unacceptable by Barr.  The record evidence also discloses that Barr determined that HC could terminate its \"C performers\" without jeopardizing its production, while dramatically reducing labor costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in the fall of 1991, Mary LeBlanc resumed her supervisory role over Woodman in the bowl department.  Around this same time, LeBlanc was privy to at least one discussion, among members of HC's upper management, in which future employee terminations were discussed.  Following such a meeting, and in the presence of Woodman, LeBlanc referenced the management discussion relating to future terminations:  \"These damn people--they want younger people here.  They will be the one[s] that will be successful here.\"   Woodman's affidavit attests that LeBlanc made similar statements on several occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the time that HC's management was deciding which employees were to be terminated, Mary LeBlanc submitted a memorandum, dated November 15, 1991, describing Woodman's work performance as having been unsatisfactory throughout the period \"since July 1991.\"   The November 15 memorandum made no reference to the performance review by Lucas in late July 1991.  LeBlanc described Woodman as an \"unmotivated worker\" who \"would prefer to sit in the Bowl Prep area and read for extended periods of time up to several hours.\"   She noted further that Woodman was slow, routinely requiring a minimum of thirty minutes to dress for the sterile conditions in the clean room, whereas the requisite procedures should take no longer than ten minutes.  LeBlanc reported that Woodman possessed limited skills:  \"Frank cannot perform 50% of line operations to standard requirement.  He can only be assigned 2 off line jobs in the clean room, where his performance will not affect production quantities.\"   Furthermore, she stated, despite Woodman's training on most assembly-line operations, his inability to perform those operations in a satisfactory manner had led to the abandonment of further training efforts.  LeBlanc concluded:  \"I recommend Frank be relieved from his current duties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days later, in a reduction in force (\"RIF\"), thirty-three HC employees were terminated;  twelve, including Woodman, were bowl department employees.  HC presented statistical evidence demonstrating that the ratio of older to younger employees in the bowl department increased slightly during the reduction in force;  viz., 41% over age 40 before the RIF;  44% after the RIF.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodman received written notice of his immediate termination on November 20, which advised that HC had decided that it could \"eliminate a group of its poorest performers and still meet the production plan.\"   Later, HC reported to the Massachusetts Department of Employment Training that Woodman was discharged as part of a reduction in force involving the company's \"poorest performers.\"   On March 2, 1993, Woodman initiated the present suit in federal district court, alleging age discrimination in violation of the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the statement attributed to Mary LeBlanc by the Woodman affidavit submitted in opposition to HC's motion for summary judgment was excluded by the district court as inadmissible \"totem-pole\" (i.e., multiple) hearsay, \"unavailing on a motion for summary judgment.\"   The court went on to conclude that though Woodman had made out a prima facie case of age discrimination, HC had rebutted the resulting presumption of unlawful age discrimination by producing enough evidence, if credited, to enable a rational trier of fact to find a nondiscriminatory basis for Woodman's dismissal;  viz., poor work performance.  Ultimately, the district court awarded summary judgment to HC on the ground that Woodman had not proffered competent evidence sufficient to generate a trialworthy issue as to whether impermissible age-based discrimination constituted a determinative factor in the dismissal.  Woodman appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the evidence, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party resisting summary judgment.

As the district court noted, the only substantial question was whether Woodman had met the employer's legitimate job-performance expectations.

The Woodman affidavit itself attested to facts directly contradicting several key assertions made by LeBlanc in her final work performance evaluation.  He also tendered statements from a former supervisor in the machine shop and a former group leader in the bowl department, attesting to the high quality of his work.  Second, and most importantly, the Woodman affidavit asserted that Mary LeBlanc had stated in his presence, following a meeting with upper management shortly before HC implemented its reduction in force:  \"These damn people--they want younger people here.

Thus, Woodman's evidence, including the vicarious admission made through LeBlanc--if credited by the factfinder--would be adequate not only to permit a reasonable inference that HC's articulated justification for Woodman's dismissal was a mere pretext for intentional age discrimination, but also to generate a grave \"suspicion of mendacity\" respecting the highly unfavorable performance rating made in the LeBlanc memorandum five days prior to Woodman's dismissal.

Thus, the circumstantial evidence proffered in the Woodman affidavit provided a plainly sufficient foundation, see Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2), for finding both that LeBlanc was directly involved in the reduction in force and that the excluded statement concerned matters within the scope of her employment.  Indeed, any contrary suggestion is belied by HC's firm reliance on LeBlanc's adverse performance evaluation as the principal justification for its decision to terminate Woodman.  Finally, the circumstantial evidence proffered in the Woodman affidavit attests, and the excluded statement itself reflects, that LeBlanc purported to be communicating to Woodman information acquired at the HC management meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that though the Woodman affidavit may reflect that LeBlanc's description of HC management's attitude toward older workers was predicated on more than one statement made at the management meeting in LeBlanc's presence, her statement to Woodman was not hearsay, even though offered for its truth.

HC was not entitled to summary judgment, given the competent evidentiary proffer that its articulated reason for discharging Woodman was an untruthful pretext for intentional age-based discrimination.
