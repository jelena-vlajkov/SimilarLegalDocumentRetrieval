In light  of the  government's concession\n                \n\nthat the weight of \"liquid LSD\" should have been recalculated\n\nin accordance with the 1993 amendment to U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c),\n\nthe amended sentence is hereby vacated and the case  remanded\n\nfor resentencing.  See Loc. R.  27.1.  The parties cannot  by\n                      \n\nagreement  create error where none exists  but we agree that,\n\nat least on the surface, the commentary arguably contemplates\n\nsome adjustment where liquid LSD is involved.\n\n     The government requests that we take this opportunity to\n\nset forth  the proper methodology for  calculating the weight\n\nof liquid LSD  under the sentencing guidelines.   For several\n\nreasons, we think such a step would be premature.  The matter\n\nwas never presented to the district court (due in part to the\n\ndifferent position advanced by  the government below) and has\n\nnot been fully  addressed in this  court (due in part  to the\n\nintervening motion to withdraw submitted by defense counsel).\n\nAt  least at  first glance,  several contrasting  methods for\n\nresolving  the issue  appear  plausible.   See, e.g.,  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.  Jordan, 842  F.

Depending on\n\nthe findings  reached by  the district  court on  remand, the\n\npossible sentencing  ranges or sentences may  each fall short\n\nof  the  applicable  five-year  mandatory  minimum--rendering\n\n                    \n\n1.

And defendant will have\n\nnew  counsel on  remand.   For  these  reasons, we  think  it\n\npreferable to have  the district court address  the matter in\n\nthe first instance, on the basis of all arguments the parties\n\ndeem pertinent. \n\n     The  motion  of  defendant's   counsel  to  withdraw  is\n\nallowed.   The motion for appointment  of replacement counsel\n\nis denied  without prejudice;  defendant is directed  to file\n\nsuch a motion  with the  district court.   As defendant  will\n\nsoon  have been  incarcerated  for five  years--the mandatory\n\nminimum--we urge the district  court to address these matters\n\nas promptly as possible. \n\n     The amended  sentence is  vacated and the  case remanded\n                                                             \n\nfor  resentencing.
