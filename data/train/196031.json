Plaintiff appeals the  dismissal of\r                                \n\nthe  complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief\n\ncan  be granted.  The case grows out of plaintiff's discharge\n\nfrom  the United  States Postal  Service.   He unsuccessfully\n\nchallenged his  discharge before the Merit Systems Protection\n\nBoard and  appealed to  the Federal Circuit,  which affirmed.\n\nThe  Supreme  Court  denied   his  petition  for  certiorari.\n\nPlaintiff  now attempts  to  assert tort  claims for  damages\n\nbased on the same alleged violations of his Fourth Amendment,\n\nprivacy and due process  rights which he argued  before those\n\ntribunals.   See generally Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents\r                                                                         \n\nof  the  Fed.

Even  assuming   a\n\nconstitutional issue, however, the complaint does not present\n\na proper  case for a Bivens or state tort remedy.  The CSRA's\r                                       \n\ncomprehensive  scheme is  designed to  provide the  exclusive\n\nremedy for most government employee  complaints of prohibited\n\npersonnel practices.

The  exclusivity of the  remedy generally bars  both\r\r\n\nBivens  claims as well as state  law claims for damages.
