This  appeal requires us  to\r                                            \r\n\ndecide whether the procedural due process requirements of Goss v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975), applied to and, if so, were correctly\r               \r\n\napplied to a high school student before his suspension.\r\n\n       Appellant,  a senior  at  Winchester High  School, brought\r\n\nsuit  under both  federal and  state statutes  and constitutional\r\n\nprovisions against  the school  principal, the superintendent  of\r\n\nschools,  and the  school committee,  seeking injunctive  relief,\r\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages,  and attorney's fees and costs\r\n\nfor his ten-day suspension from school and exclusion from various\r\n\nextracurricular activities.  \r\n\n     At  the conclusion of a  five-day bench trial,  in which the\r\n\nevidence  and argument  focused solely  on whether  appellant had\r\n\nbeen afforded procedural due  process, the district court granted\r\n\njudgment  as a matter of law for the school committee members and\r\n\nfound that the process  given appellant was adequate.   Appellant\r\n\nappeals from these dispositions  but has not furnished us  with a\r\n\ntranscript of the trial proceedings.  We affirm.\r\n\n     The  case revolves  about a  nine-page document  bearing, in\r\n\nlarge capital  letters, the scatological title,  \"The Shit List.\"\r\n\nApart  from a cover page and a concluding page containing general\r\n\nremarks of a boorish  nature, the document zeroed in on  some 140\r\n\nnamed students,1 each name being followed by one or more lines of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  The district court referred to the list as containing\r\n\"the first name and the first initial of the last name\" of\r\nstudents.  The list appearing in the record as an exhibit\r\ncontains the initial of the given name and the full surname of\r\neach student.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ncrude descriptions  of character and/or behavior.   The freshmen,\r\n\nfewer  than a  dozen, were  treated to  insulting comments  about\r\n\ntheir  appearance or  social  conduct.   But  the sophomores  and\r\n\njuniors,  more than  thirty in  each group,  and more  than sixty\r\n\nseniors  were  characterized by  epithets  that  were not  merely\r\n\ninsulting as to appearance,  but suggestive, often explicitly so,\r\n\nof sexual capacity, proclivity, and promiscuity.\r\n\n     The sequence of events  leading to appellant's suspension is\r\n\nthe following.   On September  18, 1994, a  Sunday, some  fifteen\r\n\nstudents  were gathered in the home of  one of them when the list\r\n\nwas  created by someone still unknown.  On Thursday appellant and\r\n\ntwo  other boys made copies of  the list and put  them in a trash\r\n\nbarrel.  They were delivered to the school soon after.   After it\r\n\nwas  discovered  by  a  faculty member  the  next  day, Principal\r\n\nRitchie announced to  the school  that the list  was harmful  and\r\n\ndegrading, and urged  students to provide  information as to  the\r\n\nperpetrators.   On the following Monday,  September 26, appellant\r\n\nand  two  others   came  to  Ritchie's  office   and  denied  any\r\n\ninvolvement.\r\n\n     The  next  day  they  came  back  and  said  that  they  had\r\n\nphotocopied the  list but denied  knowing the contents  and that,\r\n\nsince the photocopying  was outside of school premises, they were\r\n\nnot  subject to school  discipline.  The  principal disagreed and\r\n\nsaid  that  they  would  probably face  suspension.    Meanwhile,\r\n\nPrincipal  Ritchie met with other students and compiled a list of\r\n\nfifteen students who were  said to be present at  the creation of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthe list.   On Thursday, September  29, a letter was  sent to the\r\n\nfifteen, announcing a  meeting the  next day for  them and  their\r\n\nparents.  \r\n\n     At the September 30 meeting, Principal Ritchie said that the\r\n\nlist was a violation of  the school's rules, as set forth  in the\r\n\nschool  handbook, against  harassment and  obscenity.   After the\r\n\nmeeting,  Ritchie met with appellant  and his mother  and said he\r\n\nwas indefinitely suspended.  He did not specify the length of the\r\n\nsuspension, but said that  information would soon be forthcoming.\r\n\nIn a letter requested by the principal and received the following\r\n\nMonday,  October 3,  appellant  wrote apologizing  for this  \"bad\r\n\nmistake\" and saying:\r\n\n          My involvement in the list is such; I had the list\r\n     copied  with 2 other boys and we then proceeded to take\r\n     the list put it in a trash bag and put it in the barrel\r\n     at Gin [Ginn Field] where it was to be picked up.\r\n\n     Two days later, Ritchie met with the school's \"Crisis Team,\"\r\n\nconsisting of  twelve staff  members, and then  wrote appellant's\r\n\nmother, specifying  \"the consequences for your son, Christopher's\r\n\nparticipation  in  the  chain  of   events  leading  up  to   the\r\n\ndistribution of the 'Shit List' at Winchester High School.\"  They\r\n\nwere  suspension  for ten  days,  and exclusion  from  any school\r\n\nsocial events and interscholastic athletics.  \r\n\n     Principal  Ritchie identified  the  following parts  of  the\r\n\nStudent Handbook  as being violated: (1) the  cover, which called\r\n\nfor  an  end to  name calling,  harassment,  \"put downs;\"  (2) an\r\n\nopening  statement proscribing  \"harassment of  any kind;\"  (3) a\r\n\nsection proscribing violent behavior,  vandalism, or violation of\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nstudents' civil  rights on  school premises or  at school-related\r\n\nevents,  carrying  the  sanction   of  indefinite  suspension  or\r\n\nexpulsion; and (4) a section barring abusive or  obscene language\r\n\nor materials.   Possible  reinstatement to athletic  programs (in\r\n\nappellant's  case,  lacrosse)  and  removal of  the  letter  from\r\n\nappellant's file was to depend on steps \"to repair the damage\" to\r\n\nindividuals and the school.\r\n\n     In a subsequent, undated  letter to the principal, appellant\r\n\ncomplained of his  \"excessive punishment\" and added  to his prior\r\n\nstatement that he thought \"it was the Underground Newspaper.\"\r\n\n     Appeals  to  the  superintendent  and later  to  the  school\r\n\ncommittee, in  which presentations were made  by both appellant's\r\n\nattorney and the principal, were unsuccessful.\r\n\n                            Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n     We  must  first  face a  threshold  question:   whether  the\r\n\nsanction imposed  on  appellant was  an  expulsion or  a  ten-day\r\n\nsuspension.  Appellant's brief assumes throughout that it was the\r\n\nformer,  citing the  fact that  Principal Ritchie  initially told\r\n\nappellant  and his  mother  than he  was indefinitely  suspended.\r\n\nAppellant then cites  Jones v.  Fitchburg, 211 Mass.  66, 68,  97\r                                                   \r\n\nN.E.  612, 613  (1912), for  the proposition  that  a suspension,\r\n\n\"intended to operate[] for an indefinite period, . . . in  effect\r\n\namount[s]  to  a permanent  exclusion. .  .  .\"   Accordingly, he\r\n\ninvokes the  authorities that  specify a considerable  panoply of\r\n\nrights,  including the  assistance of  counsel  and the  right to\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nexamine  witnesses at  a hearing.   See,  e.g., Dixon  v. Alabama\r                                                                           \r\n\nState Bd. of Educ., 294 F.2d 150, 159 (5th Cir. 1961).\r                            \r\n\n     Unfortunately  for  appellant, the  mere  repetition  of the\r\n\nexpulsion label  is of no  avail.  As  the district court  found,\r\n\nPrincipal Ritchie, after informing  appellant and his mother that\r\n\nhe was  indefinitely suspended, told them that they would receive\r\n\nthe information  as to the length  of the suspension  in the mail\r\n\n\"shortly thereafter.\"  Five days later, after conferring with the\r\n\n\"Crisis  Team,\" he sent his  letter of October  5, containing the\r\n\ndetails of  the ten-day suspension.  Appellant  cannot attack the\r\n\nbasis  of the district court's finding that he was suspended, for\r\n\nhe  has not furnished  us with a  transcript. Real v.  Hogan, 828\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 58, 60  (1st Cir.  1987) (\"If [the  existing record]  proves\r\n\ninconclusive, it is the appellant  who must bear the brunt of  an\r\n\ninsufficient record on appeal.\")  In any event, however, we would\r\n\nbe unlikely to find \"clear error\" in the finding.   Cf. Roland M.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Concord School Committee, 910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                     \r\n\n     We  are,  therefore,  dealing  with the  kind  of  temporary\r\n\nsuspension at issue  in Goss v.  Lopez.  In  that case the  Court\r                                                \r\n\nsuccinctly  summarized the three  procedural prerequisites: \"that\r\n\nthe  student be  given  oral or  written  notice of  the  charges\r\n\nagainst  him  and,  if he  denies  them,  an  explanation of  the\r\n\nevidence the authorities have and  an opportunity to present  his\r\n\nside of the story.\"  419 U.S. at 581.   The Court added, \"In  the\r\n\ngreat majority of cases the disciplinarian may informally discuss\r\n\nthe  alleged misconduct  with the  student  minutes after  it has\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\noccurred.\"  Id. at 582.  In order for the student \"to explain his\r                         \r\n\nversion of the  facts at  this discussion, [he  should] first  be\r\n\ntold  what he  is accused  of  doing and  what the  basis of  the\r\n\naccusation  is.\"   Id.   \"Requiring  that  there be  at  least an\r                                \r\n\ninformal  give-and-take between student  and disciplinarian,\" the\r\n\nCourt concluded, would at least give the student \"the opportunity\r\n\nto  characterize his  conduct and  put it  in  what he  deems the\r\n\nproper context.\" Id. at 584.\r                              \r\n\n     It  is clear,  first  of all,  that  appellant had  adequate\r\n\nnotice.    The  principal  warned  him  several  days  before the\r\n\nsuspension  took  effect that  the  conduct  he had  acknowledged\r\n\nlikely would result in his suspension.  The principal's letter of\r\n\nOctober 5,  elaborating  on  and specifying  the  bases  for  the\r\n\nsuspension,  referred to  the High  School Handbook,  which every\r\n\nstudent  was obliged to read  and understand.   Its cover, as the\r\n\nletter   noted,  briefly  but  clearly  identified  name-calling,\r\n\nharassment,  and  \"put downs\"  as actions  to  be resisted.   The\r\n\nprincipal also referred to the \"Opening Remarks\" of the Handbook,\r\n\nprohibiting \"harassment of any  kind.\"  This introductory section\r\n\ndefined \"harassment\" as \"conduct,  behavior, or comments that are\r\n\npersonally offensive, degrading, or  threatening to others,\"  and\r\n\ngave such examples as \"sexually suggestive remarks, . . . and the\r\n\ndisplay  or circulation  of  written materials  .  . .  that  are\r\n\ndegrading to any individual. . . .\"\r\n\n     Thirdly,  the  principal  cited  to  a   regulation  barring\r\n\nfighting,  violent behavior,  or  \"violation of  other  students'\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ncivil rights\"  on school premises, the violation  of which called\r\n\nfor an  indefinite suspension and possibly  expulsion.  Appellant\r\n\nchallenges the relevance of  this regulation to the facts  of his\r\n\ncase.    He also  argues  that more  formal  procedures regarding\r\n\nnotice, counsel, and presentation of witnesses are required under\r\n\nthis regulation.   This would seem  to be true but  it is obvious\r\n\nfrom  the sanction  imposed,  a temporary  suspension, that  this\r\n\nregulation was not a ground for decision.\r\n\n     The principal's fourth basis  for punishment was regulations\r\n\nbarring  the use of either obscene materials or language that was\r\n\n\"abusive,\" \"obscene,\" \"profane,\" or \"vulgar.\" \r\n\n     Apart from the attack noted above to the third ground listed\r\n\nby  the principal, appellant makes only two arguments.  The first\r\n\nis that a passage  in \"Opening Remarks\" urges sensitivity  to the\r\n\nfeelings of others and prompt communication between a student who\r\n\nfeels aggrieved  and an  offender so that  objectionable behavior\r\n\nmay be brought to an end quickly.  To read this as preempting any\r\n\nmore severe treatment  of what has been  \"strictly prohibited\" is\r\n\nnot  only  to treat  the  Opening Remarks  section  as internally\r\n\ninconsistent  but also  to  ignore other  parts  of the  Handbook\r\n\ndetailing a  twelve point \"Range of  Consequences\" for violations\r\n\nof the student  disciplinary code that extend from verbal warning\r\n\nto  expulsion.   Appellant's second thrust is against the charges\r\n\nof  abusive or obscene language.   His brief  makes the assertion\r\n\nthat \"Notwithstanding  that Ritchie found no  evidence to support\r\n\nthe  foregoing,  Ritchie  cites  this  regulation  without   ever\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nexplaining to Donovan  how it was violated.\"   This, in the light\r\n\nof \"The Shit List\" itself,  defies rational justification even in\r\n\nthe context of strenuous advocacy. \r\n\n     By  the same token, there can be no rational question raised\r\n\nas  to  the basis  for the  suspension.   Indeed,  appellant knew\r\n\nprecisely what  the basis was -- the preparation and distribution\r\n\nof the list; he  acknowledged his part in making  photocopies and\r\n\nmerely asserts  that he did not know the contents.  This leads us\r\n\nto the third requirement of Goss v. Lopez, an opportunity for the\r                                                   \r\n\nstudent to have presented his version of the facts.\r\n\n     We conclude  from the  record that  appellant had,  and took\r\n\nadvantage of, multiple opportunities to present his view  of what\r\n\noccurred.  On September  26, he and two others met with Principal\r\n\nRitchie  and denied any involvement.   On September  27, they had\r\n\nanother meeting  and admitted  photocopying, but no  knowledge of\r\n\ncontents.   They also advanced  their defense that  their act did\r\n\nnot  take place on school  property.  On  September 30, appellant\r\n\nand his  mother met  separately with  Principal Ritchie,  after a\r\n\nlarger meeting, and  had the opportunity to add to  what had been\r\n\nsaid.\r\n\n     We  add  these  observations.    At  no  time has  appellant\r\n\nindicated  the presence of any evidence other than his own say-so\r\n\nthat  could shed light on  his defense of  ignorance of contents.\r\n\nMoreover,  as  we  reflect  on the  giant-sized  capital  letters\r\n\nspelling  out  the  title  of the  list  on  the  cover,  and the\r\n\nfollowing  listing names  with,  generally, a  salacious one-line\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ncommentary,  we  can  be  skeptical  of  the  likelihood  of  one\r\n\nremaining oblivious to content  after feeding into and retrieving\r\n\nfrom  the  copying  machine  multiple copies  of  this  nine-page\r\n\ndocument.   Given the nature  of the defense,  the nature of  the\r\n\nevidence, the lack of any trial transcript, and the opportunities\r\n\ngiven appellant  to explain and support his position, we conclude\r\n\nthat  the  disciplinarian  was  entitled to  make  a  credibility\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n     We take note of an argument briefly advanced by appellant --\r\n\nthat, because  of the bar to interscholastic  athletics and other\r\n\nschool  activities,  in addition  to  a  ten-day suspension,  the\r\n\npunishment falls outside of  Goss and required a higher  level of\r                                           \r\n\nprocedural  formalities.  We are  not unmindful of  the impact of\r\n\nsanctions other than suspension  and expulsion.  As the  Court in\r\n\nGoss  recognized,  there  may be  \"unusual  situations,  although\r              \r\n\ninvolving only  a short  suspension, [where] something  more than\r\n\nthe  rudimentary procedures will  be required.\" 419  U.S. at 584.\r\n\nBut  the mere  fact that  other sanctions  are  added to  a short\r\n\nsuspension does not trigger  a requirement for a more  formal set\r\n\nof procedures.  In Goss itself one of the plaintiffs had not only\r                                 \r\n\nbeen  suspended, but had been transferred  to another school. Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 569  n.4.  What must  remain the focus is  whether the student\r\n\nwas  given  the  opportunity  to  present  his  version  of  what\r\n\noccurred.  In this case appellant has never suggested any respect\r\n\nin which he was denied this opportunity.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n     We add one final  word.  We  have said that appellant  bears\r\n\nany  risk stemming  from an  inadequate record.   Our  reading of\r\n\nappellees'  Proposed Findings  of Facts  below suggests  that the\r\n\nabsence of a record may have deprived us of evidence that is more\r\n\nadverse than helpful to appellant.   In any event, on this record\r\n\nwe conclude that he received all of the process that was due.\r\n\n     We make  short shrift of two  other arguments.   One is that\r\n\nMass. Gen.  L. ch. 71,   84 prohibits the suspension of a student\r\n\nfor \"marriage, pregnancy, parenthood or  for conduct which is not\r\n\nconnected with any school-sponsored activities. . . .\"  While the\r\n\ncontext suggests that  the statute is dealing  with matters other\r\n\nthan actions taken with  and aimed toward other students,  we are\r\n\nentirely satisfied  with  the  district  court's  reasoning  that\r\n\nappellant's   \"admitted   off-premises   conduct   led   to   the\r\n\ndistribution of the list on school premises.\"  As for appellant's\r\n\nobjection  to  the  judgment  dismissing the  claim  against  the\r\n\nmembers  of the school committee, our due process holding renders\r\n\nfurther statement unnecessary.\r\n\n     We do not, however, deem this  such a frivolous appeal as to\r\n\ngrant appellees' motion for attorney's fees.\r\n\n     AFFIRMED.\r                       \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n",

Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975), applied to and, if so, were correctly applied to a high school student before his suspension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, a senior at Winchester High School, brought suit under both federal and state statutes and constitutional provisions against the school principal, the superintendent of schools, and the school committee, seeking injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees and costs for his ten-day suspension from school and exclusion from various extracurricular activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of a five-day bench trial, in which the evidence and argument focused solely on whether appellant had been afforded procedural due process, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law for the school committee members and found that the process given appellant was adequate.  Appellant appeals from these dispositions but has not furnished us with a transcript of the trial proceedings.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case revolves about a nine-page document bearing, in large capital letters, the scatological title, \"The Shit List.\"   Apart from a cover page and a concluding page containing general remarks of a boorish nature, the document zeroed in on some 140 named students,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> each name being followed by one or more lines of crude descriptions of character and/or behavior.  The freshmen, fewer than a dozen, were treated to insulting comments about their appearance or social conduct.  But the sophomores and juniors, more than thirty in each group, and more than sixty seniors were characterized by epithets that were not merely insulting as to appearance, but suggestive, often explicitly so, of sexual capacity, proclivity, and promiscuity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sequence of events leading to appellant's suspension is the following.  On September 18, 1994, a Sunday, some fifteen students were gathered in the home of one of them when the list was created by someone still unknown.  On Thursday appellant and two other boys made copies of the list and put them in a trash barrel.  They were delivered to the school soon after.  After it was discovered by a faculty member the next day, Principal Ritchie announced to the school that the list was harmful and degrading, and urged students to provide information as to the perpetrators.  On the following Monday, September 26, appellant and two others came to Ritchie's office and denied any involvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day they came back and said that they had photocopied the list but denied knowing the contents and that, since the photocopying was outside of school premises, they were not subject to school discipline.  The principal disagreed and said that they would probably face suspension.  Meanwhile, Principal Ritchie met with other students and compiled a list of fifteen students who were said to be present at the creation of the list.  On Thursday, September 29, a letter was sent to the fifteen, announcing a meeting the next day for them and their parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the September 30 meeting, Principal Ritchie said that the list was a violation of the school's rules, as set forth in the school handbook, against harassment and obscenity.  After the meeting, Ritchie met with appellant and his mother and said he was indefinitely suspended.  He did not specify the length of the suspension, but said that information would soon be forthcoming.  In a letter requested by the principal and received the following Monday, October 3, appellant wrote apologizing for this \"bad mistake\" and saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My involvement in the list is such;  I had the list copied with 2 other boys and we then proceeded to take the list put it in a trash bag and put it in the barrel at Gin [Ginn Field] where it was to be picked up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days later, Ritchie met with the school's \"Crisis Team,\" consisting of twelve staff members, and then wrote appellant's mother, specifying \"the consequences for your son, Christopher's participation in the chain of events leading up to the distribution of the 'Shit List' at Winchester High School.\"   They were suspension for ten days, and exclusion from any school social events and interscholastic athletics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Principal Ritchie identified the following parts of the Student Handbook as being violated:  (1) the cover, which called for an end to name calling, harassment, \"put downs;\"  (2) an opening statement proscribing \"harassment of any kind;\"  (3) a section proscribing violent behavior, vandalism, or violation of students' civil rights on school premises or at school-related events, carrying the sanction of indefinite suspension or expulsion;  and (4) a section barring abusive or obscene language or materials.  Possible reinstatement to athletic programs (in appellant's case, lacrosse) and removal of the letter from appellant's file was to depend on steps \"to repair the damage\" to individuals and the school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a subsequent, undated letter to the principal, appellant complained of his \"excessive punishment\" and added to his prior statement that he thought \"it was the Underground Newspaper.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeals to the superintendent and later to the school committee, in which presentations were made by both appellant's attorney and the principal, were unsuccessful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must first face a threshold question:  whether the sanction imposed on appellant was an expulsion or a ten-day suspension. Appellant's brief assumes throughout that it was the former, citing the fact that Principal Ritchie initially told appellant and his mother than he was indefinitely suspended.  Appellant then cites Jones v. Fitchburg, 211 Mass. 66, 68, 97 N.E. 612, 613 (1912), for the proposition that a suspension, \"intended to operate[ ] for an indefinite period, ... in effect amount[s] to a permanent exclusion....\"  Accordingly, he invokes the authorities that specify a considerable panoply of rights, including the assistance of counsel and the right to examine witnesses at a hearing.  See, e.g., Dixon v. Alabama State Bd. of Educ., 294 F.2d 150, 159 (5th Cir.1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for appellant, the mere repetition of the expulsion label is of no avail.  As the district court found, Principal Ritchie, after informing appellant and his mother that he was indefinitely suspended, told them that they would receive the information as to the length of the suspension in the mail \"shortly thereafter.\"   Five days later, after conferring with the \"Crisis Team,\" he sent his letter of October 5, containing the details of the ten-day suspension.  Appellant cannot attack the basis of the district court's finding that he was suspended, for he has not furnished us with a transcript.  Real v. Hogan, 828 F.2d 58, 60 (1st Cir.1987) (\"If [the existing record] proves inconclusive, it is the appellant who must bear the brunt of an insufficient record on appeal.\")   In any event, however, we would be unlikely to find \"clear error\" in the finding.  Cf. Roland M. v. Concord School Committee, 910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are, therefore, dealing with the kind of temporary suspension at issue in Goss v. Lopez.   In that case the Court succinctly summarized the three procedural prerequisites:  \"that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\"  419 U.S. at 581, 95 S.Ct. at 740.   The Court added, \"In the great majority of cases the disciplinarian may informally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred.\"  Id. at 582, 95 S.Ct. at 740.   In order for the student \"to explain his version of the facts at this discussion, [he should] first be told what he is accused of doing and what the basis of the accusation is.\"  Id.  \"Requiring that there be at least an informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian,\" the Court concluded, would at least give the student \"the opportunity to characterize his conduct and put it in what he deems the proper context.\"  Id. at 584, 95 S.Ct. at 741.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear, first of all, that appellant had adequate notice.  The principal warned him several days before the suspension took effect that the conduct he had acknowledged likely would result in his suspension.  The principal's letter of October 5, elaborating on and specifying the bases for the suspension, referred to the High School Handbook, which every student was obliged to read and understand.  Its cover, as the letter noted, briefly but clearly identified name-calling, harassment, and \"put downs\" as actions to be resisted.  The principal also referred to the \"Opening Remarks\" of the Handbook, prohibiting \"harassment of any kind.\"   This introductory section defined \"harassment\" as \"conduct, behavior, or comments that are personally offensive, degrading, or threatening to others,\" and gave such examples as \"sexually suggestive remarks, ... and the display or circulation of written materials ... that are degrading to any individual....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirdly, the principal cited to a regulation barring fighting, violent behavior, or \"violation of other students' civil rights\" on school premises, the violation of which called for an indefinite suspension and possibly expulsion.  Appellant challenges the relevance of this regulation to the facts of his case.  He also argues that more formal procedures regarding notice, counsel, and presentation of witnesses are required under this regulation.  This would seem to be true but it is obvious from the sanction imposed, a temporary suspension, that this regulation was not a ground for decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal's fourth basis for punishment was regulations barring the use of either obscene materials or language that was \"abusive,\" \"obscene,\" \"profane,\" or \"vulgar.\"Apart from the attack noted above to the third ground listed by the principal, appellant makes only two arguments.  The first is that a passage in \"Opening Remarks\" urges sensitivity to the feelings of others and prompt communication between a student who feels aggrieved and an offender so that objectionable behavior may be brought to an end quickly.  To read this as preempting any more severe treatment of what has been \"strictly prohibited\" is not only to treat the Opening Remarks section as internally inconsistent but also to ignore other parts of the Handbook detailing a twelve point \"Range of Consequences\" for violations of the student disciplinary code that extend from verbal warning to expulsion.  Appellant's second thrust is against the charges of abusive or obscene language.  His brief makes the assertion that \"Notwithstanding that Ritchie found no evidence to support the foregoing, Ritchie cites this regulation without ever explaining to Donovan how it was violated.\"   This, in the light of \"The Shit List\" itself, defies rational justification even in the context of strenuous advocacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, there can be no rational question raised as to the basis for the suspension.  Indeed, appellant knew precisely what the basis was--the preparation and distribution of the list;  he acknowledged his part in making photocopies and merely asserts that he did not know the contents.  This leads us to the third requirement of Goss v. Lopez, an opportunity for the student to have presented his version of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude from the record that appellant had, and took advantage of, multiple opportunities to present his view of what occurred.  On September 26, he and two others met with Principal Ritchie and denied any involvement.  On September 27, they had another meeting and admitted photocopying, but no knowledge of contents.  They also advanced their defense that their act did not take place on school property.  On September 30, appellant and his mother met separately with Principal Ritchie, after a larger meeting, and had the opportunity to add to what had been said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add these observations.  At no time has appellant indicated the presence of any evidence other than his own say-so that could shed light on his defense of ignorance of contents.  Moreover, as we reflect on the giant-sized capital letters spelling out the title of the list on the cover, and the following listing names with, generally, a salacious one-line commentary, we can be skeptical of the likelihood of one remaining oblivious to content after feeding into and retrieving from the copying machine multiple copies of this nine-page document.  Given the nature of the defense, the nature of the evidence, the lack of any trial transcript, and the opportunities given appellant to explain and support his position, we conclude that the disciplinarian was entitled to make a credibility judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take note of an argument briefly advanced by appellant--that, because of the bar to interscholastic athletics and other school activities, in addition to a ten-day suspension, the punishment falls outside of Goss and required a higher level of procedural formalities.  We are not unmindful of the impact of sanctions other than suspension and expulsion.  As the Court in Goss recognized, there may be \"unusual situations, although involving only a short suspension, [where] something more than the rudimentary procedures will be required.\"  419 U.S. at 584, 95 S.Ct. at 741.   But the mere fact that other sanctions are added to a short suspension does not trigger a requirement for a more formal set of procedures.  In Goss itself one of the plaintiffs had not only been suspended, but had been transferred to another school.  Id. at 569 n. 4, 95 S.Ct. at 733 n. 4.   What must remain the focus is whether the student was given the opportunity to present his version of what occurred.  In this case appellant has never suggested any respect in which he was denied this opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add one final word.  We have said that appellant bears any risk stemming from an inadequate record.  Our reading of appellees' Proposed Findings of Facts below suggests that the absence of a record may have deprived us of evidence that is more adverse than helpful to appellant.  In any event, on this record we conclude that he received all of the process that was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make short shrift of two other arguments.  One is that Mass.Gen.L. ch. 71, Sec. 84 prohibits the suspension of a student for \"marriage, pregnancy, parenthood or for conduct which is not connected with any school-sponsored activities....\"  While the context suggests that the statute is dealing with matters other than actions taken with and aimed toward other students, we are entirely satisfied with the district court's reasoning that appellant's \"admitted off-premises conduct led to the distribution of the list on school premises.\"   As for appellant's objection to the judgment dismissing the claim against the members of the school committee, our due process holding renders further statement unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not, however, deem this such a frivolous appeal as to grant appellees' motion for attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court referred to the list as containing \"the first name and the first initial of the last name\" of students.  The list appearing in the record as an exhibit contains the initial of the given name and the full surname of each student</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Appellant's brief assumes throughout that it was the former, citing the fact that Principal Ritchie initially told appellant and his mother than he was indefinitely suspended.  Appellant then cites Jones v. Fitchburg, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></span>, 68, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></span>, 613 (1912), for the proposition that a suspension, \"intended to operate[ ] for an indefinite period, ... in effect amount[s] to a permanent exclusion....\"  Accordingly, he invokes the authorities that specify a considerable panoply of rights, including the assistance of counsel and the right to examine witnesses at a hearing.  See, e.g., Dixon v. Alabama State Bd. of Educ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"254928\"><a href=\"/opinion/254928/st-john-dixon-v-alabama-state-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span>, 159 (5th Cir.1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for appellant, the mere repetition of the expulsion label is of no avail.  As the district court found, Principal Ritchie, after informing appellant and his mother that he was indefinitely suspended, told them that they would receive the information as to the length of the suspension in the mail \"shortly thereafter.\"   Five days later, after conferring with the \"Crisis Team,\" he sent his letter of October 5, containing the details of the ten-day suspension.  Appellant cannot attack the basis of the district court's finding that he was suspended, for he has not furnished us with a transcript.  Real v. Hogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493886\"><a href=\"/opinion/493886/john-real-v-william-t-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.1987) (\"If [the existing record] proves inconclusive, it is the appellant who must bear the brunt of an insufficient record on appeal.\")   In any event, however, we would be unlikely to find \"clear error\" in the finding.  Cf. Roland M. v. Concord School Committee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546213\"><a href=\"/opinion/546213/roland-m-and-miriam-m-v-the-concord-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span>, 990 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are, therefore, dealing with the kind of temporary suspension at issue in Goss v. Lopez.   In that case the Court succinctly summarized the three procedural prerequisites:  \"that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">story.\"</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 95 S.Ct. at 740.   The Court added, \"In the great majority of cases the disciplinarian may informally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 582, </a></span>95 S.Ct. at 740.   In order for the student \"to explain his version of the facts at this discussion, [he should] first be told what he is accused of doing and what the basis of the accusation is.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  \"Requiring that </a></span>there be at least an informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian,\" the Court concluded, would at least give the student \"the opportunity to characterize his conduct and put it in what he deems the proper context.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 584, </a></span>95 S.Ct. at 741.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear, first of all, that appellant had adequate notice.  The principal warned him several days before the suspension took effect that the conduct he had acknowledged likely would result in his suspension.  The principal's letter of October 5, elaborating on and specifying the bases for the suspension, referred to the High School Handbook, which every student was obliged to read and understand.  Its cover, as the letter noted, briefly but clearly identified name-calling, harassment, and \"put downs\" as actions to be resisted.  The principal also referred to the \"Opening Remarks\" of the Handbook, prohibiting \"harassment of any kind.\"   This introductory section defined \"harassment\" as \"conduct, behavior, or comments that are personally offensive, degrading, or threatening to others,\" and gave such examples as \"sexually suggestive remarks, ... and the display or circulation of written materials ... that are degrading to any individual....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirdly, the principal cited to a regulation barring fighting, violent behavior, or \"violation of other students' civil rights\" on school premises, the violation of which called for an indefinite suspension and possibly expulsion.  Appellant challenges the relevance of this regulation to the facts of his case.  He also argues that more formal procedures regarding notice, counsel, and presentation of witnesses are required under this regulation.  This would seem to be true but it is obvious from the sanction imposed, a temporary suspension, that this regulation was not a ground for decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal's fourth basis for punishment was regulations barring the use of either obscene materials or language that was \"abusive,\" \"obscene,\" \"profane,\" or \"vulgar.\"Apart from the attack noted above to the third ground listed by the principal, appellant makes only two arguments.  The first is that a passage in \"Opening Remarks\" urges sensitivity to the feelings of others and prompt communication between a student who feels aggrieved and an offender so that objectionable behavior may be brought to an end quickly.  To read this as preempting any more severe treatment of what has been \"strictly prohibited\" is not only to treat the Opening Remarks section as internally inconsistent but also to ignore other parts of the Handbook detailing a twelve point \"Range of Consequences\" for violations of the student disciplinary code that extend from verbal warning to expulsion.  Appellant's second thrust is against the charges of abusive or obscene language.  His brief makes the assertion that \"Notwithstanding that Ritchie found no evidence to support the foregoing, Ritchie cites this regulation without ever explaining to Donovan how it was violated.\"   This, in the light of \"The Shit List\" itself, defies rational justification even in the context of strenuous advocacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, there can be no rational question raised as to the basis for the suspension.  Indeed, appellant knew precisely what the basis was--the preparation and distribution of the list;  he acknowledged his part in making photocopies and merely asserts that he did not know the contents.  This leads us to the third requirement of Goss v. Lopez, an opportunity for the student to have presented his version of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude from the record that appellant had, and took advantage of, multiple opportunities to present his view of what occurred.  On September 26, he and two others met with Principal Ritchie and denied any involvement.  On September 27, they had another meeting and admitted photocopying, but no knowledge of contents.  They also advanced their defense that their act did not take place on school property.  On September 30, appellant and his mother met separately with Principal Ritchie, after a larger meeting, and had the opportunity to add to what had been said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add these observations.  At no time has appellant indicated the presence of any evidence other than his own say-so that could shed light on his defense of ignorance of contents.  Moreover, as we reflect on the giant-sized capital letters spelling out the title of the list on the cover, and the following listing names with, generally, a salacious one-line commentary, we can be skeptical of the likelihood of one remaining oblivious to content after feeding into and retrieving from the copying machine multiple copies of this nine-page document.  Given the nature of the defense, the nature of the evidence, the lack of any trial transcript, and the opportunities given appellant to explain and support his position, we conclude that the disciplinarian was entitled to make a credibility judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take note of an argument briefly advanced by appellant--that, because of the bar to interscholastic athletics and other school activities, in addition to a ten-day suspension, the punishment falls outside of Goss and required a higher level of procedural formalities.  We are not unmindful of the impact of sanctions other than suspension and expulsion.  As the Court in Goss recognized, there may be \"unusual situations, although involving only a short suspension, [where] something more than the rudimentary procedures will be required.\"  419 U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">584,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span>.   But the mere fact that other sanctions are added to a short suspension does not trigger a requirement for a more formal set of procedures.  In Goss itself one of the plaintiffs had not only been suspended, but had been transferred to another school.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 569 </a></span>n. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">4,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">733</span> </a></span>n. 4.   What must remain the focus is whether the student was given the opportunity to present his version of what occurred.  In this case appellant has never suggested any respect in which he was denied this opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add one final word.  We have said that appellant bears any risk stemming from an inadequate record.  Our reading of appellees' Proposed Findings of Facts below suggests that the absence of a record may have deprived us of evidence that is more adverse than helpful to appellant.  In any event, on this record we conclude that he received all of the process that was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make short shrift of two other arguments.  One is that Mass.Gen.L. ch. 71, Sec. 84 prohibits the suspension of a student for \"marriage, pregnancy, parenthood or for conduct which is not connected with any school-sponsored activities....\"  While the context suggests that the statute is dealing with matters other than actions taken with and aimed toward other students, we are entirely satisfied with the district court's reasoning that appellant's \"admitted off-premises conduct led to the distribution of the list on school premises.\"   As for appellant's objection to the judgment dismissing the claim against the members of the school committee, our due process holding renders further statement unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not, however, deem this such a frivolous appeal as to grant appellees' motion for attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court referred to the list as containing \"the first name and the first initial of the last name\" of students.  The list appearing in the record as an exhibit contains the initial of the given name and the full surname of each student</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
