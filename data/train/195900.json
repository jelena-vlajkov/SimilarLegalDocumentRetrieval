(Echo) ran out of fuel, lost engine power,\n\nand crashed into  Casco Bay  off the Maine  coast, killing  three\n\npassengers.    The  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (the  FAA)\n\ncharged the pilot and Echo with violating several aviation safety\n\nregulations   and   issued  emergency   orders   revoking  Echo's\n\ncertificate  to operate as an  air carrier, a  sanction upheld by\n\nthe  National  Transportation Safety  Board  (the  Board).   Echo\n\npetitions for review.  We affirm.\n\n                          I. Background\r                                                 \n\nA.   Facts\r                    \n\n     Echo is a Maine  corporation established in 1985 by  John G.\n\nRafter, Jr.  to provide commercial flight  services by helicopter\n\nin  the Portland area.   Rafter is Echo's  president, director of\n\noperations, director of maintenance,  and chief pilot.   In 1993,\n\nRafter founded another  company, Airmed  Skycare, Inc.  (Airmed),\n\nwhich was  devoted  exclusively to  emergency medical  services.1\n\nAirmed  owned its  own helicopter for  air ambulance  flights and\n\nemployed flight nurses  and paramedics.  It  contracted with Echo\n\nto  supply the  pilots for  its  flights.   In  the afternoon  of\n\nNovember  19, 1993, Airmed received a call requesting that a burn\n\nvictim be flown from Ellsworth, Maine to  Portland for treatment.\n\nWith Rafter  as pilot,  and flying  under  Echo's certificate  to\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     1   Rafter  was   also   Airmed's  president   and  majority\nshareholder.\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\noperate  as an air carrier, the helicopter took off from Portland\n\nto Ellsworth.\n\n     The weather conditions at  the time of takeoff were,  in the\n\nwords  of  Echo, \"marginal,\"  because  of  fog  and  light  rain.\n\nNevertheless,  Rafter concluded  that  the flight  could be  made\n\nsafely under  Visual Flight Rules  (VFR), and he  took off.   The\n\ntrip to Ellsworth was successful.  The medical team picked up the\n\nburn  victim,  and  the   helicopter  began  its  return  flight.\n\nApproximately fifty miles northeast of Portland, however, weather\n\nconditions deteriorated.   The helicopter, then  travelling at an\n\naltitude of  approximately 800  feet, entered the  clouds; Rafter\n\nwas  no longer  able  to navigate  visually.   He  requested  and\n\nreceived Instrument Flight Rules  (IFR) handling from air traffic\n\ncontrol at the Brunswick Naval Air Station,  which instructed him\n\nto climb  above the clouds  to 3,000 feet.   Rafter climbed  to a\n\nhigher  altitude and  proceeded to  navigate by  the helicopter's\n\ninstruments.\n\n     It is  clear that,  under normal conditions,  neither Rafter\n\nnor  the helicopter  was authorized  to operate  under IFR.   The\n\noperations  specifications  on  Echo's  air  carrier  certificate\n\nauthorized  Echo  to  operate  on  \"VFR  only.\"     Further,  the\n\nhelicopter did  not contain  all the  equipment required for  IFR\n\noperation.  Finally, Rafter did  not have the recent  operational\n\nexperience  necessary for  IFR operation.   Echo  maintains that,\n\nbecause of the emergency  situation caused by weather conditions,\n\noperation under IFR was justified pursuant to 14 C.F.R.   91.3(b)\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n(\"In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot\n\nin  command may deviate from any rule  to the extent necessary to\n\nmeet that  emergency.\").  Rafter  did not  declare an  emergency,\n\nhowever,  or advise air traffic that he, Echo, and the helicopter\n\nwere all  unauthorized  to operate  under IFR,  conduct he  later\n\nascribed to \"pilot ego.\"  \n\n     Not  having   been  advised   otherwise,  the  air   traffic\n\ncontroller  treated  the  flight  as  normal  IFR  traffic.    At\n\napproximately  8:15 p.m.,  after tracking  the flight  for thirty\n\nminutes, Brunswick Naval  Air Station passed  it off to  Portland\n\nApproach  Control.    Meanwhile,  at the  higher  elevation,  the\n\nhelicopter  was  encountering  strong headwinds  and  turbulence,\n\ncausing slower progress to  Portland than Rafter had anticipated.\n\nAir traffic  in  Portland noticed  that  the helicopter  was  not\n\nmaintaining its  assigned course or altitude,  which Rafter later\n\nattributed to the demands of piloting under IFR and in turbulence\n\nwhen  the helicopter was not properly equipped for IFR operation.\n\nSix or seven minutes  after contacting Portland Approach Control,\n\nRafter  noticed that  he was  running low  on fuel.   He  advised\n\nPortland air  traffic and requested a  direct instrument approach\n\nto runway 29.  Air traffic gave him top  priority, but it was too\n\nlate.  Rafter  soon reported  a loss  of fuel  pressure, and  the\n\nengine  lost power.   About  eight miles  north of  Portland, the\n\nhelicopter crashed into Casco  Bay.  The burn patient,  paramedic\n\nand nurse all died.  Rafter survived the crash.\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n     This  was  not the  first  time Echo  had  violated aviation\n\nsafety regulations.   In 1987,  Echo was found  to have  employed\n\nunqualified pilots, operated a helicopter with a litter  that had\n\nnot  been inspected  and approved,  and flown  over water  with a\n\nhelicopter  that was not equipped with pop-out floats.  For these\n\nbreaches,  Echo's  operating certificate  was  suspended for  270\n\ndays, 255 days of which were waived pending one year of operation\n\nwithout violations.\n\nB.   Procedural History\r                                 \n\n     After the crash, the FAA accused Echo and Rafter of numerous\n\nregulatory violations  and  issued emergency  orders  immediately\n\nrevoking  Rafter's  pilot  certificate  and  Echo's  air  carrier\n\ncertificate.     A   full  evidentiary   hearing  ensued.     The\n\nAdministrative  Law   Judge  (ALJ)   upheld  revocation  of   the\n\ncertificates, accepting certain of  the allegations of wrongdoing\n\nbut  rejecting others.2  Echo  and Rafter appealed  to the Board.\n\nThe Board reduced the  revocation of Rafter's pilot's certificate\n\nto a  180-day suspension, principally based  on its determination\n\nthat  Rafter could  not be  faulted for  his initial  decision to\n\naccept  the flight  despite  the weather  conditions.   Based  on\n\nRafter's  misconduct in  his  capacity as  the  manager of  Echo,\n\nhowever, the Board  upheld the revocation  of Echo's air  carrier\n\ncertificate.\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     2  Most notably, the ALJ rejected the allegation that Rafter\ncommenced the flight with insufficient fuel.\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n     In particular,  the Board  found that the  emergency weather\n\nconditions that  developed did not excuse  the various regulatory\n\nviolations caused by  the helicopter's sustained operation  under\n\nIFR.   The Board acknowledged  that a pilot  may deviate from any\n\nregulation to respond to an in-flight emergency, but \"only to the\n\nextent  required to meet that  emergency.\"  14  C.F.R.   91.3(b).\n\nIt found  that, once Rafter was  no longer able  to operate under\n\nVFR, he should have  asked air traffic for assistance  in landing\n\nas soon as possible.  Instead, without advising air traffic of an\n\nemergency,  or  that  he,  his  aircraft,  and  his  company were\n\nunauthorized  to  fly  under  IFR,  he  obtained  IFR  clearance,\n\naccepted a higher altitude, and proceeded to fly  toward Portland\n\nfor another thirty minutes.   The Board found that Rafter, in his\n\ncapacity  as the manager  of Echo, had  thus displayed  a lack of\n\ndisposition to comply with safety regulations:\n\n     [A] serious operational misjudgment that may be excusable as\n     an   aberrant   occurrence   for   an   individual   becomes\n     indefensible when that pilot is, also, the person in control\n     of  a  carrier's  operations,   for  an  air  carrier  whose\n     management does  not  adhere unflinchingly  to all  relevant\n     operational  standards  does  not  meet  its  obligation  to\n     provide  the highest degree of  safety.  We  think that when\n     respondent Rafter,  with full knowledge that  neither he nor\n     his  aircraft should be operating under IFR, surreptitiously\n     chose to disregard,  contrary to numerous requirements,  his\n     company's operations specifications and manual by proceeding\n     with a  flight he  should have ended,  he demonstrated  that\n     respondent  Echo lacks  the compliance  disposition expected\n     and demanded of an air carrier.\n\nEcho now challenges this order.\n\n                          II. Discussion\r                                                  \n\n     Initially, we  note that Board decisions  are given generous\n\ndeference  on review:  they must  be affirmed  unless \"arbitrary,\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ncapricious,  an   abuse  of  discretion,  or   otherwise  not  in\n\naccordance with law.\"   5  U.S.C.   706(2)(A);  Hite v.  National\r                                                                           \n\nTransp. Safety Bd., 991 F.2d  17, 20 (1st Cir. 1993).   Moreover,\r                            \n\n\"`the  strong policy concern for  public safety requires that the\n\nBoard   be  given  a   wide  range  of   discretion  in  imposing\n\nsanctions.'\"  Hite, 991  F.2d at 20 (quoting Johnson  v. National\r                                                                           \n\nTransp. Safety Bd., 979 F.2d 618, 622 (7th Cir. 1992).\r                            \n\n     Echo claims that the Board abused its discretion by revoking\n\nits  certificate  rather than  issuing  a  lesser sanction.    It\n\ngrounds  this  assertion  upon  the premise  that  revocation  is\n\nallowed only when  an air carrier engages  in repeated, flagrant,\n\nor deliberate regulatory violations.\n\n     We disagree.   At the relevant time, the statutory authority\n\nto  revoke an air  carrier certificate was  found at  49 U.S.C.  \n\n1429(a), which provided simply  that if, after investigation, the\n\nSecretary  of  Transportation  \"determines  that  safety  in  air\n\ncommerce or air transportation  and the public interest requires,\n\n[he]  may issue an  order . . .  revoking . .  . [an] air carrier\n\noperating  certificate.\"3   As  guidelines for  implementing this\n\nbroad discretion, an FAA order states:\n\n     Revocation  of  a certificate  is  used  as a  remedial\n     measure,   when  the   certificate  holder   lacks  the\n     necessary  qualifications . . .  .  [It] is appropriate\n     whenever the certificate holder's  conduct demonstrates\n     a  lack  of  the   care,  judgment  and  responsibility\n     required of the holder of such a certificate.  \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     3  The  statute  was  revised in  1994  without  substantive\nchange.  It now appears at 49 U.S.C.   44709(b).\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nCompliance and Enforcement Program, FAA Order No. 2150.3A   206.b\r                                            \n\n(Feb.  21, 1992).  This standard has governed Board decisions for\n\nsome  time.   E.g.,  Administrator v.  Guy  Am. Airways,  Inc., 4\r                                                                        \n\nN.T.S.B. 888, 892 (1983) (\"Revocation is reserved for those cases\n\nin which  putative conduct, whether  safety-related or otherwise,\n\ndemonstrates that  a certificate  holder no longer  possesses the\n\nrequisite  qualifications,  in  terms   of  care,  judgment   and\n\nresponsibility, necessary  for  continued certification.\").    We\n\nrecognized this standard in Hite, 991 F.2d at 20.\r                                          \n\n     Echo  points to language in  a different section  of the FAA\n\norder  and certain  caselaw  as support  for  its assertion  that\n\nrevocation is appropriate only upon a finding of a pervasive lack\n\nof qualifications manifested by deliberate, repeated, or flagrant\n\nregulatory  violations.    The  language it  notes,  however,  is\n\nnothing  but a list of certain instances when revocation might be\n\nappropriate;4  the standard itself is as set out above.  Further,\n                    \r                              \n\n     4 Echo points to   206.b(4) of the FAA order, which states:\n\n     In cases  involving businesses, revocation should  be sought\n     whenever   there   is  a   demonstration   of   a  lack   of\n     qualifications.   Revocation would probably  be appropriate,\n     for example,  in  cases  involving  deliberate  or  flagrant\n     violations or the falsification of records.  Revocation also\n     would  probably  be  appropriate   in  cases  in  which  the\n     certificate  holder  has  committed  the  same   or  similar\n     violations  in the  recent  past, or  where the  certificate\n     holder no longer  has, or  does not obtain  in a  reasonable\n     time, the personnel or equipment to conduct its operation in\n     accordance with the [Act] or [federal aviation regulations].\n\nWe  agree  with the  Sixth  Circuit's  observation, made  in  the\ncontext  of  a challenge  to  an air  carrier's  suspension, that\nlisting several instances warranting  a particular sanction \"does\nnot imply  that other circumstances never  warrant\" the sanction.\nConnaire, Inc. v.  Secretary, United States Dep't of Transp., 887\r                                                                      \n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthe  cases it cites  do not support  the existence of  the higher\n\nstandard.   For example, Carey v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 275 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n518,  522 (1st Cir.  1960), held  that conduct  even on  a single\n\nflight may justify  revocation of an airman's certificate.  Other\n\ncited  cases,  while  involving  egregious  misconduct,  do   not\n\nestablish that  such misconduct is a  prerequisite to revocation.\n\nE.g.,  Administrator v.  Mikesell,  N.T.S.B.  Order  No.  EA-2788\r                                           \n\n(1988).\n\n     Echo's other arguments  are equally unavailing.   It sees an\n\nabuse of discretion in the Board's finding that Rafter's  conduct\n\nduring the  flight was relevant  to his qualifications  to manage\n\nthe operations of  the company.  For support, it  points to a few\n\ndecisions involving operational  misconduct by managers  who also\n\nhad  airman's  certificates,  which   held  that,  based  on  the\n\nparticular facts,  sanctions should  relate to the  company's air\n\ncarrier certificate only.  E.g., Administrator v. Diaz-Saldana, 1\r                                                                        \n\nN.T.S.B.   1599   (1972)   (inappropriate   to   suspend  airline\n\npresident's  airman certificate for  authorizing company's use of\n\nan  unairworthy aircraft;  since he  had not  piloted any  of the\n\nrelevant flights, sanction should fall on company alone).\n\n     Here,  however, Rafter was pilot of  a particular flight and\n\nsimultaneously Echo's president, director of operations, director\n\nof maintenance, and chief pilot.  Assume that a flight facing the\n\nsame  emergency  weather  conditions  radioed in  to  Rafter  for\n\nguidance,  and  that Rafter,  on the  ground,  told the  pilot to\n                    \r                              \n\nF.2d 723, 727 (6th Cir. 1989).\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nrequest IFR  handling without  advising air traffic  control that\n\nthe aircraft,  the pilot,  and the  company were  each prohibited\n\nfrom  flying under IFR.  Assume further that Rafter, knowing that\n\nIFR  was forbidden  for these  reasons, ordered  that  the flight\n\ncontinue  under  IFR  for a  full  thirty  minutes.   Under  such\n\ncircumstances, it would hardly  be an abuse of discretion  if the\n\nBoard were to conclude that  Echo showed a lack of  the requisite\n\n\"care,  judgment  and  responsibility  necessary   for  continued\n\ncertification.\"  So too we find no abuse of discretion  here, for\n\nRafter is  not excused from his managerial  misconduct because he\n\nwas piloting the flight at the time.\n\n     Affirmed.\r                        \n\n                               -10-\r\r\n",

(Echo) ran out of fuel, lost engine power, and crashed into Casco Bay off the Maine coast, killing three passengers.  The Federal Aviation Administration (the FAA) charged the pilot and Echo with violating several aviation safety regulations and issued emergency orders revoking Echo's certificate to operate as an air carrier, a sanction upheld by the National Transportation Safety Board (the Board).  Echo petitions for review.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <p>A. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echo is a Maine corporation established in 1985 by John G. Rafter, Jr. to provide commercial flight services by helicopter in the Portland area.  Rafter is Echo's president, director of operations, director of maintenance, and chief pilot.  In 1993, Rafter founded another company, Airmed Skycare, Inc.  (Airmed), which was devoted exclusively to emergency medical services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Airmed owned its own helicopter for air ambulance flights and employed flight nurses and paramedics.  It contracted with Echo to supply the pilots for its flights.  In the afternoon of November 19, 1993, Airmed received a call requesting that a burn victim be flown from Ellsworth, Maine to Portland for treatment.  With Rafter as pilot, and flying under Echo's certificate to operate as an air carrier, the helicopter took off from Portland to Ellsworth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The weather conditions at the time of takeoff were, in the words of Echo, \"marginal,\" because of fog and light rain.  Nevertheless, Rafter concluded that the flight could be made safely under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), and he took off.  The trip to Ellsworth was successful.  The medical team picked up the burn victim, and the helicopter began its return flight.  Approximately fifty miles northeast of Portland, however, weather conditions deteriorated.  The helicopter, then travelling at an altitude of approximately 800 feet, entered the clouds;  Rafter was no longer able to navigate visually.  He requested and received Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) handling from air traffic control at the Brunswick Naval Air Station, which instructed him to climb above the clouds to 3,000 feet.  Rafter climbed to a higher altitude and proceeded to navigate by the helicopter's instruments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that, under normal conditions, neither Rafter nor the helicopter was authorized to operate under IFR.  The operations specifications on Echo's air carrier certificate authorized Echo to operate on \"VFR only.\"   Further, the helicopter did not contain all the equipment required for IFR operation.  Finally, Rafter did not have the recent operational experience necessary for IFR operation.  Echo maintains that, because of the emergency situation caused by weather conditions, operation under IFR was justified pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Sec. 91.3(b) (\"In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule to the extent necessary to meet that emergency.\").  Rafter did not declare an emergency, however, or advise air traffic that he, Echo, and the helicopter were all unauthorized to operate under IFR, conduct he later ascribed to \"pilot ego.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not having been advised otherwise, the air traffic controller treated the flight as normal IFR traffic.  At approximately 8:15 p.m., after tracking the flight for thirty minutes, Brunswick Naval Air Station passed it off to Portland Approach Control.  Meanwhile, at the higher elevation, the helicopter was encountering strong headwinds and turbulence, causing slower progress to Portland than Rafter had anticipated.  Air traffic in Portland noticed that the helicopter was not maintaining its assigned course or altitude, which Rafter later attributed to the demands of piloting under IFR and in turbulence when the helicopter was not properly equipped for IFR operation.  Six or seven minutes after contacting Portland Approach Control, Rafter noticed that he was running low on fuel.  He advised Portland air traffic and requested a direct instrument approach to runway 29.  Air traffic gave him top priority, but it was too late.  Rafter soon reported a loss of fuel pressure, and the engine lost power.  About eight miles north of Portland, the helicopter crashed into Casco Bay.  The burn patient, paramedic and nurse all died.  Rafter survived the crash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was not the first time Echo had violated aviation safety regulations.  In 1987, Echo was found to have employed unqualified pilots, operated a helicopter with a litter that had not been inspected and approved, and flown over water with a helicopter that was not equipped with pop-out floats.  For these breaches, Echo's operating certificate was suspended for 270 days, 255 days of which were waived pending one year of operation without violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the crash, the FAA accused Echo and Rafter of numerous regulatory violations and issued emergency orders immediately revoking Rafter's pilot certificate and Echo's air carrier certificate.  A full evidentiary hearing ensued.  The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) upheld revocation of the certificates, accepting certain of the allegations of wrongdoing but rejecting others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Echo and Rafter appealed to the Board.  The Board reduced the revocation of Rafter's pilot's certificate to a 180-day suspension, principally based on its determination that Rafter could not be faulted for his initial decision to accept the flight despite the weather conditions.  Based on Rafter's misconduct in his capacity as the manager of Echo, however, the Board upheld the revocation of Echo's air carrier certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In particular, the Board found that the emergency weather conditions that developed did not excuse the various regulatory violations caused by the helicopter's sustained operation under IFR.  The Board acknowledged that a pilot may deviate from any regulation to respond to an in-flight emergency, but \"only to the extent required to meet that emergency.\"  14 C.F.R. Sec. 91.3(b).  It found that, once Rafter was no longer able to operate under VFR, he should have asked air traffic for assistance in landing as soon as possible.  Instead, without advising air traffic of an emergency, or that he, his aircraft, and his company were unauthorized to fly under IFR, he obtained IFR clearance, accepted a higher altitude, and proceeded to fly toward Portland for another thirty minutes.  The Board found that Rafter, in his capacity as the manager of Echo, had thus displayed a lack of disposition to comply with safety regulations:[A] serious operational misjudgment that may be excusable as an aberrant occurrence for an individual becomes indefensible when that pilot is, also, the person in control of a carrier's operations, for an air carrier whose management does not adhere unflinchingly to all relevant operational standards does not meet its obligation to provide the highest degree of safety.  We think that when respondent Rafter, with full knowledge that neither he nor his aircraft should be operating under IFR, surreptitiously chose to disregard, contrary to numerous requirements, his company's operations specifications and manual by proceeding with a flight he should have ended, he demonstrated that respondent Echo lacks the compliance disposition expected and demanded of an air carrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echo now challenges this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, we note that Board decisions are given generous deference on review:  they must be affirmed unless \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"  5 U.S.C. Sec. 706(2)(A);  Hite v. National Transp. Safety Bd., 991 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir.1993).  Moreover, \" 'the strong policy concern for public safety requires that the Board be given a wide range of discretion in imposing sanctions.' \"  Hite, 991 F.2d at 20 (quoting Johnson v. National Transp. Safety Bd., 979 F.2d 618, 622 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echo claims that the Board abused its discretion by revoking its certificate rather than issuing a lesser sanction.  It grounds this assertion upon the premise that revocation is allowed only when an air carrier engages in repeated, flagrant, or deliberate regulatory violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  At the relevant time, the statutory authority to revoke an air carrier certificate was found at 49 U.S.C.App. Sec. 1429(a), which provided simply that if, after investigation, the Secretary of Transportation \"determines that safety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest requires, [he] may issue an order ... revoking ... [an] air carrier operating certificate.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As guidelines for implementing this broad discretion, an FAA order states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Revocation of a certificate is used as a remedial measure, when the certificate holder lacks the necessary qualifications....  [It] is appropriate whenever the certificate holder's conduct demonstrates a lack of the care, judgment and responsibility required of the holder of such a certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compliance and Enforcement Program, FAA Order No. 2150.3A p 206.b (Feb. 21, 1992).  This standard has governed Board decisions for some time.  E.g., Administrator v. Guy Am.  Airways, Inc., 4 N.T.S.B. 888, 892 (1983) (\"Revocation is reserved for those cases in which putative conduct, whether safety-related or otherwise, demonstrates that a certificate holder no longer possesses the requisite qualifications, in terms of care, judgment and responsibility, necessary for continued certification.\").  We recognized this standard in Hite, 991 F.2d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echo points to language in a different section of the FAA order and certain caselaw as support for its assertion that revocation is appropriate only upon a finding of a pervasive lack of qualifications manifested by deliberate, repeated, or flagrant regulatory violations.  The language it notes, however, is nothing but a list of certain instances when revocation might be appropriate;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  the standard itself is as set out above.  Further, the cases it cites do not support the existence of the higher standard.  For example, Carey v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 275 F.2d 518, 522 (1st Cir.1960), held that conduct even on a single flight may justify revocation of an airman's certificate.  Other cited cases, while involving egregious misconduct, do not establish that such misconduct is a prerequisite to revocation.  E.g., Administrator v. Mikesell, N.T.S.B. Order No. EA-2788 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echo's other arguments are equally unavailing.  It sees an abuse of discretion in the Board's finding that Rafter's conduct during the flight was relevant to his qualifications to manage the operations of the company.  For support, it points to a few decisions involving operational misconduct by managers who also had airman's certificates, which held that, based on the particular facts, sanctions should relate to the company's air carrier certificate only.  E.g., Administrator v. Diaz-Saldana, 1 N.T.S.B. 1599 (1972) (inappropriate to suspend airline president's airman certificate for authorizing company's use of an unairworthy aircraft;  since he had not piloted any of the relevant flights, sanction should fall on company alone).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Rafter was pilot of a particular flight and simultaneously Echo's president, director of operations, director of maintenance, and chief pilot.  Assume that a flight facing the same emergency weather conditions radioed in to Rafter for guidance, and that Rafter, on the ground, told the pilot to request IFR handling without advising air traffic control that the aircraft, the pilot, and the company were each prohibited from flying under IFR.  Assume further that Rafter, knowing that IFR was forbidden for these reasons, ordered that the flight continue under IFR for a full thirty minutes.  Under such circumstances, it would hardly be an abuse of discretion if the Board were to conclude that Echo showed a lack of the requisite \"care, judgment and responsibility necessary for continued certification.\"   So too we find no abuse of discretion here, for Rafter is not excused from his managerial misconduct because he was piloting the flight at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rafter was also Airmed's president and majority shareholder</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Most notably, the ALJ rejected the allegation that Rafter commenced the flight with insufficient fuel</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The statute was revised in 1994 without substantive change.  It now appears at 49 U.S.C. Sec. 44709(b)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Echo points to p 206.b(4) of the FAA order, which states:</p>\n        <p>In cases involving businesses, revocation should be sought whenever there is a demonstration of a lack of qualifications.  Revocation would probably be appropriate, for example, in cases involving deliberate or flagrant violations or the falsification of records.  Revocation also would probably be appropriate in cases in which the certificate holder has committed the same or similar violations in the recent past, or where the certificate holder no longer has, or does not obtain in a reasonable time, the personnel or equipment to conduct its operation in accordance with the [Act] or [federal aviation regulations].</p>\n        <p>We agree with the Sixth Circuit's observation, made in the context of a challenge to an air carrier's suspension, that listing several instances warranting a particular sanction \"does not imply that other circumstances never warrant\" the sanction.

Airways, Inc., 4 N.T.S.B. 888, 892 (1983) (\"Revocation is reserved for those cases in which putative conduct, whether safety-related or otherwise, demonstrates that a certificate holder no longer possesses the requisite qualifications, in terms of care, judgment and responsibility, necessary for continued certification.\").  We recognized this standard in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604819\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hite,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/604819/thomas-d-hite-v-national-transportation-safety-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echo points to language in a different section of the FAA order and certain caselaw as support for its assertion that revocation is appropriate only upon a finding of a pervasive lack of qualifications manifested by deliberate, repeated, or flagrant regulatory violations.  The language it notes, however, is nothing but a list of certain instances when revocation might be appropriate;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  the standard itself is as set out above.  Further, the cases it cites do not support the existence of the higher standard.  For example, Carey v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"250291\"><a href=\"/opinion/250291/william-peter-carey-v-civil-aeronautics-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 522 (1st Cir.1960), held that conduct even on a single flight may justify revocation of an airman's certificate.  Other cited cases, while involving egregious misconduct, do not establish that such misconduct is a prerequisite to revocation.  E.g., Administrator v. Mikesell, N.T.S.B. Order No. EA-2788 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echo's other arguments are equally unavailing.  It sees an abuse of discretion in the Board's finding that Rafter's conduct during the flight was relevant to his qualifications to manage the operations of the company.  For support, it points to a few decisions involving operational misconduct by managers who also had airman's certificates, which held that, based on the particular facts, sanctions should relate to the company's air carrier certificate only.  E.g., Administrator v. Diaz-Saldana, 1 N.T.S.B. 1599 (1972) (inappropriate to suspend airline president's airman certificate for authorizing company's use of an unairworthy aircraft;  since he had not piloted any of the relevant flights, sanction should fall on company alone).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Rafter was pilot of a particular flight and simultaneously Echo's president, director of operations, director of maintenance, and chief pilot.  Assume that a flight facing the same emergency weather conditions radioed in to Rafter for guidance, and that Rafter, on the ground, told the pilot to request IFR handling without advising air traffic control that the aircraft, the pilot, and the company were each prohibited from flying under IFR.  Assume further that Rafter, knowing that IFR was forbidden for these reasons, ordered that the flight continue under IFR for a full thirty minutes.  Under such circumstances, it would hardly be an abuse of discretion if the Board were to conclude that Echo showed a lack of the requisite \"care, judgment and responsibility necessary for continued certification.\"   So too we find no abuse of discretion here, for Rafter is not excused from his managerial misconduct because he was piloting the flight at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rafter was also Airmed's president and majority shareholder</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Most notably, the ALJ rejected the allegation that Rafter commenced the flight with insufficient fuel</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The statute was revised in 1994 without substantive change.

Revocation would probably be appropriate, for example, in cases involving deliberate or flagrant violations or the falsification of records.  Revocation also would probably be appropriate in cases in which the certificate holder has committed the same or similar violations in the recent past, or where the certificate holder no longer has, or does not obtain in a reasonable time, the personnel or equipment to conduct its operation in accordance with the [Act] or [federal aviation regulations].</p>\n        <p>We agree with the Sixth Circuit's observation, made in the context of a challenge to an air carrier's suspension, that listing several instances warranting a particular sanction \"does not imply that other circumstances never warrant\" the sanction.
