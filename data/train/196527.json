Stat. Ann.   397-A:14(I) (West\r\n\nSupp.  1994) (\"Simple Interest Statute\" or \"SIS\").  In a thought-\r\n\nful and comprehensive opinion, the district  court ruled that the\r\n\nSimple  Interest Statute,  as applied  to a  residential mortgage\r\n\nloan permitting  negative amortization,  is preempted  by section\r\n\n501(a)(1).  \r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          On January  15, 1988, Dime  Real Estate Services  - New\r\n\nHampshire,  Inc.  (\"Dime  Real  Estate NH\")  made  a  thirty-year\r\n\nadjustable rate loan to Timothy Ray and Thomas F. Richards in the\r\n\napproximate amount  of $111,000, secured  by a first  mortgage on\r\n\ntheir  residence in Milford, New Hampshire.  Dime Real Estate NH,\r\n\nincorporated  in New  York and  licensed to  extend loans  in New\r\n\nHampshire, is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Dime Savings Bank  of\r\n\nNew  York,  FSB (\"Dime  Savings\"), a  federally-chartered savings\r\n\ninstitution  also incorporated in New York.  The Ray and Richards\r\n\nnote, which  contained a provision  permitting negative amortiza-\r\n\ntion, was assigned to Dime Savings the day it was made.\r\n\n          The  interest rate was fixed at 7.75% for the first six\r\n\nmonths, adjustable monthly thereafter at a margin of 3% above the\r\n\n\"monthly median  cost  of  funds\" ratio,  as  determined  by  the\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nFederal  Home Loan  Bank  Board  (\"FHLBB\"),  and rounded  to  the\r\n\nnearest one-eighth  of one percentage  point.  The  interest rate\r\n\nwas capped, by agreement, at 9.75% for the second six months, and\r\n\n13.875% thereafter.  The  note afforded protection from unantici-\r\n\npated variable interest rate increases by permitting the borrower\r\n\nto pay either the total principal and interest due for the month,\r                       \r\n\nor a lower \"minimum required  payment amount.\"  In the  event the\r                    \r\n\nborrower elected  to make  the lower \"minimum  required payment,\"\r\n\nhowever, the  interest remaining unpaid  for that month  would be\r\n\nadded onto  the loan principal, resulting  in \"negative amortiza-\r\n\ntion,\" and the interest  due the following month would  be calcu-\r\n\nlated on the basis of the higher adjusted loan principal.  \r\n\n          On October  31, 1990,  Ray and Richards  conveyed their\r\n\nMilford  residence,  subject to  the  Dime  Savings mortgage,  to\r\n\nappellants Robert and Jennifer Grunbeck, who occupied it as their\r\n\nprincipal residence.  After the Grunbecks  ceased payments on the\r\n\nmortgage in 1993,  Dime Savings  instituted foreclosure  proceed-\r\n\nings.   The  Grunbecks responded  with an  Ex Parte  Petition for\r\n\nInjunctive Relief  in New Hampshire state  court, claiming, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia,  that  the  negative  amortization  provision  \"compounded\"\r              \r\n\ninterest and, therefore, violated  the Simple Interest  Statute.1\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The Simple Interest Statute provides:\r\n\n          Any first mortgage  home loan made  under the\r\n          provisions  of  this chapter  [Chapter 397-A:\r\n          Licensing  of  Nondepository  First  Mortgage\r\n          Bankers and  Brokers  of Title  35 Banks  and\r\n          Banking;  Loan  Associations; Credit  Unions]\r\n          shall provide for the computation of interest\r\n          on a simple interest basis.  \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nDime Savings promptly removed the case to federal district court,\r\n\nsee  28 U.S.C.     1441,  1446; see  also id.     1332 (diversity\r                                                       \r\n\njurisdiction),  then  moved to  dismiss  on  the ground,  amongst\r\n\nothers,2  that  section 501(a)(1)  of  the  Monetary Control  Act\r\n\npreempts the Simple Interest Statute.

For present\r                       \r\n\npurposes, therefore,  we accept the allegation  that the negative\r\n\namortization provision in the loan agreement \"compounds\" interest\r\n\nand thus  contravenes the Simple Interest  Statute.

The  district court\r\nbypassed these  claims, and dismissed on the Monetary Control Act\r\npreemption ground.  Grunbeck v. Dime  Sav.

In particular, we  bypass the \"standing\"  claim because\r\nthe undeveloped  record does  not enable its  reliable determina-\r\ntion.  \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nwe  turn to consider whether  the statute, so  construed, is pre-\r\n\nempted by section 501(a)(1).3  \r\n\nB.

Supp. at 297-98,  the parties focus\r                              \r\n\ntheir preemption  analyses primarily on the  phrase \"limiting the\r\n\nrate or amount of interest.\" \r\n\n          As  Dime  Savings views  the  matter,  the SIS  plainly\r\n\n\"limits\" the \"rate or  amount of interest\" received in  the sense\r\n\nthat  more interest would be paid by the borrower were \"compound-\r                    \r\n\ning\" not banned under  the SIS; and the SIS  effectively \"limits\"\r\n\nthe \"amount\" of interest the lender can recover in the sense that\r\n\nthe lender could earn  more interest were it permitted  to charge\r\n\ninterest at the same \"rate\" calculated on a compound basis.\r                                                                    \r\n\n          These arguments  rest on the implicit  premise that the\r\n\n\"amount\"  of interest the lender  may charge is  \"limited\" by the\r\n\nSIS.  On  the contrary, the SIS imposes no  restriction on either\r\n\nthe  \"rate\" or  the  \"amount\" of  interest  the borrower  may  be\r\n\ncharged,  but merely  requires that any  interest rate  or amount\r                                                 \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The Grunbecks do not dispute that the Dime Savings mortgage\r\nloan  meets the three criteria set out in   s (A)-(C).  Grunbeck,\r                                                                          \r\n848 F.

Thus, nothing in the SIS prevents a lender from contract-\r\n\ning  for whatever  simple  interest rate  will exact  an interest\r                                   \r\n\nreturn  equal  to or  greater than  whatever  rate and  amount of\r\n\ninterest  would  be recoverable  through  compounding.   The  SIS\r\n\nleaves  entirely to  the parties  the rate  and amount  of simple\r\n\ninterest to be exacted. \r\n\n          The  Dime Savings interpretation  blurs the distinction\r\n\nbetween the terms  \"rate\" and  \"amount\" of interest,  as used  in\r\n\nsection  501(a)(1).   It  assumes  that the  central  question   \r                                           \r\n\nwhether  the SIS limits  the \"rate\" of  interest    is  to be re-\r                                                             \r                                 \r\n\nsolved through  reference  to  the  effect the  SIS  ban  against\r                                                    \r\n\ncharging interest  on interest  might have  upon the \"amount\"  of\r\n\ninterest  the lender may be  able to command  in the marketplace.\r                                                                          \r\n\nNot only does this assumption implicitly acknowledge that the SIS\r\n\nitself imposes no statutory  limit on the simple  interest \"rate\"\r                                            \r\n\nlenders  may charge, but it  alters the fundamental  focus of the\r\n\npreemption debate by inquiring whether the SIS might make it more\r\n\ndifficult for lenders to command    in a better-informed  market-\r\n\nplace (i.e., wherein a  \"simple interest\" calculation is mandato-\r\n\nry)    either the rate or amount of interest otherwise obtainable\r\n\nby \"compounding.\"5  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5As  the district  court  observed, \"without  being able  to\r\ncharge interest  on interest, many lenders would not allow poten-\r\ntial  borrowers to  defer accrued  interest.\"   Grunbeck, 848  F.\r                                                                  \r\nSupp.  at 299.  In other words,  many lenders might choose not to\r                                                                    \r\ncompensate by increasing the simple interest rate, and  might not\r\npermit  borrowers to defer interest payments on which no interest\r                \r\ncould be  charged.  Although unimpeachable,  these considerations\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n          No  less  importantly,  the  shift  in  analytic  focus\r\n\nattending the  Dime Savings'  assumption undermines  the required\r\n\n\"plain  language\"  interpretation,  see  Morales v.  Trans  World\r                                                                           \r\n\nAirlines, Inc., 504  U.S. 374, 383-84  (1992), by extirpating    \r                        \r\n\nfrom the pivotal section 501(a) clause:   \"expressly limiting the\r\n\nrate or amount of  interest\"    the important modifier  \"express-\r\n\nly.\"   Thus, the preemption  inquiry urged by  Dime Savings would\r\n\nfocus not on whether the \"express\" language of the SIS \"limit[s]\"\r\n\nthe rate  or amount of interest which  the lender may charge, but\r\n\non broad-gauged assessments concerning  the likely impact the SIS\r                                                                   \r\n\nban on  compounding would have  on home-mortgage lenders  and the\r\n\nindustry at large. \r\n\n          When engaged in  the task of  statutory interpretation,\r\n\n\"[c]ourts . . . should . . . attempt to give meaning to each word\r\n\nand  phrase.\"  See United  States v.

Thus, in our view the district court mistakenly\r\n\ninquired  whether the SIS ban against charging interest on inter-\r\n\nest  could affect the amount of interest lenders might command in\r                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nare inapposite to the present discussion.\r\n     First,  were a  lender to  opt not  to permit  deferments of\r\ninterest payments, it nonetheless would receive both the rate and\r\namount of simple interest  for which it contracted on  all monies\r\nloaned.   Second, in any  such transaction  it could not  be said\r\nthat  the SIS, either directly  or effectively, limited the legal\r                       \r\nrate or amount of interest chargeable by the lender.  To be sure,\r\nlenders who chose not to offset the SIS ban by raising the simple\r\ninterest rate,  or chose  not  to permit  deferments of  interest\r\npayments, would realize less total interest income as a result of\r\ntheir lending  decision.  But  as the  State noted in  its amicus\r\nmemorandum  below, \"[t]o  the  extent that  this requirement  may\r\naffect the total amount  of interest potentially realizable under\r\nthe Dime [Savings]  loan, such  effect is incidental  to the  re-\r\nquirement and cannot be viewed as an 'express' usury ceiling.\"  \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nthe marketplace,  thereby not  only eliding the  term \"expressly\"\r\n\nbut overlooking the term \"limiting\" however defined.6\r\n\n          Moreover,  the language  Congress  employed in  section\r\n\n501(a)(1)    \"expressly  limiting the rate or amount of interest\"\r\n\n   contrasts  sharply with  the preemption language  in companion\r\n\nsection 521  of the Monetary  Control Act, whereby  Congress pre-\r\n\nempted all state legislation \"with respect  to interest rates\" in\r                                                        \r\n\norder  to protect  federally insured  State-chartered banks  from\r\n\nState  regulation of credit card  transactions.

The court  observed that \"Dime [Savings] essentially\r\nconstrues 'limiting' as an adjective meaning 'serving to restrict\r\nor restrain.' .  . .

Moreover, assuming  it may  affect loan\r                    \r\n\ndemand,  a ban  against  charging interest  on interest  does not\r\n\nartificially  disrupt the  availability of home  mortgage credit.\r                               \r\n\nSee  supra at pps. 12-15.   Finally, given  the commercial reali-\r                    \r\n\nties,  it is reasonably clear  that the SIS  ban against charging\r\n\ninterest on  interest not  only affords important  protections to\r\n\nhomebuyers  but  does so  without  \"expressly  limiting\" interest\r\n\nrates.\r\n\n          b.

Finally, even\r                                           \r\n\nassuming the  FHLBB interpretation  were apposite to  the present\r\n\ndiscussion, in the respect that the Michigan provision with which\r\n\nit  dealt  imposed a  ban on  compounding,  there is  no explicit\r\n\nindication that either agency considered the significant consumer\r\n\nprotections, see supra  at 15, afforded by state  bans    such as\r                                \r\n\nthe SIS    against  charging interest on interest.  For these and\r\n\nother  reasons discussed at  length in this  opinion, we conclude\r\n\nthat  the agency  interpretation  relied on  by  Dime Savings  is\r\n\nunpersuasive and entitled to no deference in the present context.\r\n\n          c.

We\r\ndo not resolve the  Dime Savings' Parity Act preemption  claim as\r\napplied to the present  loan, however, since it has  not yet been\r\nconsidered by the district court. \r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\ninterest-rate  ceilings  were  depressing home-mortgage  interest\r                                 \r\n\nrates to below-market levels, thereby artificially disrupting the\r                               \r\n\navailability of funds  for both traditional fixed-rate  mortgages\r\n\nand \"alternative  mortgage  transactions.\"   The  latter  concern\r\n\nprompted Congress to preempt  only state laws \"expressly limiting\r\n\nthe rate or amount of interest.\"  Thus, section  501(a)(1) of the\r\n\nMonetary Control Act was not aimed at preempting State laws, such\r\n\nas the  SIS, which  prohibit \"alternative  mortgage transactions\"\r\n\npermitting negative amortization whereby  interest may be charged\r\n\non deferred interest. \r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          We hold that the New Hampshire Simple Interest Statute,\r\n\nas applied to the Dime Savings loan, is not preempted  by section\r\n\n501(a)(1) of the  Monetary Control Act.   Consequently, we remand\r\n\nto permit  the district court  to consider  the remaining  issues\r\n\nrelating to the  petition to enjoin  foreclosure on the  Grunbeck\r\n\nresidence. \r\n\n          The judgment  is vacated and  the case is  remanded for\r                    The judgment  is vacated and  the case is  remanded for\r                                                                           \r\n\nfurther  proceedings consistent  with  this opinion.

Stat. Ann.   397-A:14(I) (West\r\n\nSupp.  1994) (\"Simple Interest Statute\" or \"SIS\").  In a thought-\r\n\nful and comprehensive opinion, the district  court ruled that the\r\n\nSimple  Interest Statute,  as applied  to a  residential mortgage\r\n\nloan permitting  negative amortization,  is preempted  by section\r\n\n501(a)(1).  \r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          On January  15, 1988, Dime  Real Estate Services  - New\r\n\nHampshire,  Inc.  (\"Dime  Real  Estate NH\")  made  a  thirty-year\r\n\nadjustable rate loan to Timothy Ray and Thomas F. Richards in the\r\n\napproximate amount  of $111,000, secured  by a first  mortgage on\r\n\ntheir  residence in Milford, New Hampshire.  Dime Real Estate NH,\r\n\nincorporated  in New  York and  licensed to  extend loans  in New\r\n\nHampshire, is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Dime Savings Bank  of\r\n\nNew  York,  FSB (\"Dime  Savings\"), a  federally-chartered savings\r\n\ninstitution  also incorporated in New York.  The Ray and Richards\r\n\nnote, which  contained a provision  permitting negative amortiza-\r\n\ntion, was assigned to Dime Savings the day it was made.\r\n\n          The  interest rate was fixed at 7.75% for the first six\r\n\nmonths, adjustable monthly thereafter at a margin of 3% above the\r\n\n\"monthly median  cost  of  funds\" ratio,  as  determined  by  the\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nFederal  Home Loan  Bank  Board  (\"FHLBB\"),  and rounded  to  the\r\n\nnearest one-eighth  of one percentage  point.  The  interest rate\r\n\nwas capped, by agreement, at 9.75% for the second six months, and\r\n\n13.875% thereafter.  The  note afforded protection from unantici-\r\n\npated variable interest rate increases by permitting the borrower\r\n\nto pay either the total principal and interest due for the month,\r                       \r\n\nor a lower \"minimum required  payment amount.\"  In the  event the\r                    \r\n\nborrower elected  to make  the lower \"minimum  required payment,\"\r\n\nhowever, the  interest remaining unpaid  for that month  would be\r\n\nadded onto  the loan principal, resulting  in \"negative amortiza-\r\n\ntion,\" and the interest  due the following month would  be calcu-\r\n\nlated on the basis of the higher adjusted loan principal.  \r\n\n          On October  31, 1990,  Ray and Richards  conveyed their\r\n\nMilford  residence,  subject to  the  Dime  Savings mortgage,  to\r\n\nappellants Robert and Jennifer Grunbeck, who occupied it as their\r\n\nprincipal residence.  After the Grunbecks  ceased payments on the\r\n\nmortgage in 1993,  Dime Savings  instituted foreclosure  proceed-\r\n\nings.   The  Grunbecks responded  with an  Ex Parte  Petition for\r\n\nInjunctive Relief  in New Hampshire state  court, claiming, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia,  that  the  negative  amortization  provision  \"compounded\"\r              \r\n\ninterest and, therefore, violated  the Simple Interest  Statute.1\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The Simple Interest Statute provides:\r\n\n          Any first mortgage  home loan made  under the\r\n          provisions  of  this chapter  [Chapter 397-A:\r\n          Licensing  of  Nondepository  First  Mortgage\r\n          Bankers and  Brokers  of Title  35 Banks  and\r\n          Banking;  Loan  Associations; Credit  Unions]\r\n          shall provide for the computation of interest\r\n          on a simple interest basis.  \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nDime Savings promptly removed the case to federal district court,\r\n\nsee  28 U.S.C.     1441,  1446; see  also </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>     1332 (diversity\r</span><pre class=\"inline\">                                                       \r\n\njurisdiction),  then  moved to  dismiss  on  the ground,  amongst\r\n\nothers,2  that  section 501(a)(1)  of  the  Monetary Control  Act\r\n\npreempts the Simple Interest Statute.

Thus, in our view the district court mistakenly\r\n\ninquired  whether the SIS ban against charging interest on inter-\r\n\nest  could affect the amount of interest lenders might command in\r                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nare inapposite to the present discussion.\r\n     First,  were a  lender to  opt not  to permit  deferments of\r\ninterest payments, it nonetheless would receive both the rate and\r\namount of simple interest  for which it contracted on  all monies\r\nloaned.

Consequently, we remand\r\n\nto permit  the district court  to consider  the remaining  issues\r\n\nrelating to the  petition to enjoin  foreclosure on the  Grunbeck\r\n\nresidence. \r\n\n          The judgment  is vacated and  the case is  remanded for\r                    The judgment  is vacated and  the case is  remanded for\r                                                                           \r\n\nfurther  proceedings consistent  with  this opinion.   Costs  are\r          further  proceedings consistent  with  this opinion.
