This  42 U.S.C.\n                                         \n\n  1983 action  was  commenced  on  June  27,  1991,  and  was\n\ndismissed as out of time.  We affirm.\n\n          Defendant,   mayor   of   Carolina,  Puerto   Rico,\n\ndetermined  that a  large number  of municipal  employees had\n\nbeen hired  as career employees  by procedures  that did  not\n\ncomply  with the Puerto Rico  Personnel statute.   On May 23,\n\n1989  he wrote  each  one a  basically  form letter  to  that\n\neffect, but  stating that recipient employee  could request a\n\nhearing in 15 days to seek to show error  in the records.  If\n\na  hearing  was   not  requested,  or  if  the   hearing  was\n\nunsuccessful, the employee would  be discharged, but would be\n\ngiven  provisional employment  during which  he or  she could\n\nappeal,  or apply  for new  employment.   The present  twelve\n\nplaintiffs   obtained   hearings,   but  were   unsuccessful.\n\nThereafter, during the summer of 1989, each received a letter\n\nfrom  defendant mayor notifying him  or her of  that fact and\n\nstating that severance \"shall be effective\" one week from the\n\ndate of the letter.  They were told they could  apply for new\n\nemployment,  but  none did.    Plaintiffs  were continued  as\n\nprovisionals  until July  23, 1990,  at which  time all  were\n\ntotally  terminated.   They  sue  for  their loss  of  career\n\nemployment.\n\n          On  defendants'  motion  for summary  judgment  the\n\ncourt  held that  the May  23, 1989  letters  were sufficient\n\n                             -2-\n\nnotification of discharge  to start the  one year statute  of\n\nlimitations, rejecting  plaintiffs' claim of July,  1990.  We\n\nconcur  in   the  judgment,   but  do  so   without  reaching\n\nplaintiffs'  contention that  the May letters  were ambiguous\n\nand  not to  be read  as definite.   Even  were that  so, the\n\nletters  sent in the summer of  1989 were unmistakably clear,\n\nand were nearly two years before suit.\n\n          Plaintiffs' sole  answer is that the  court did not\n\nrely  on   the  1989  summer  letters.    This  neglects  the\n\nelementary principle that if  a court's result is  correct it\n\nmust  be affirmed even though the court gave a wrong reason.1\n\nBrown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 459 (1953).  Persisting in this\n              \n\nerror, plaintiffs refused to  include the summer letters, and\n\nthe  pretrial order  that  admitted their  receipt, in  their\n\nappendix,  even though  the  court ordered  them  to do  so.2\n\nInstead,  in their  brief, plaintiffs  brazenly refer  to the\n\nJuly  23, 1990 letters as \"a second series of letters\" rather\n\nthan as the third.\n\n                    \n\n1.  We doubt that the court erred as  to the very lengthy May\nletters, but need not pursue analysis.\n\n2.  Defendants, as well as having to supplement the appendix,\nhave  had  to bring  four  motions.   Plaintiffs  continually\nfailed  to  file  their  brief, and  failed  to  make  proper\nservice,  or  to  comply  with  an  order  to  explain  their\ninsufficient  appendix.     The  court  referred  defendants'\nrequest  for sanctions to  the sitting panel,  and so advised\nplaintiffs.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          This appeal is worse than  frivolous, and counsel's\n\nconduct calls for sanctions against him  personally, pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. App. P. 38,  as damages and for vexatious conduct,\n\nin the amount of $2,500, payable to defendants, and not to be\n\nwaived.\n\n          Affirmed, with double costs.\n                                     \n\n                             -4-\n",
