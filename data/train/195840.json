Appellant Musheer Hasan appeals  from\r                                \n\nthe  dismissal by the district  court of his  complaint.  The\n\ncourt dismissed  the action  as frivolous  under 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1915(d).   Upon  a review of  the record  and the  briefs and\n\nfilings  of the  parties, we  agree with  the court  that the\n\naction lacked \"an  arguable basis\"  in law.   See Neitzke  v.\r                                                                     \n\nWilliams,  490 U.S.  319,  325  (1989).    In  so  doing,  we\r                    \n\nemphasize that appellee  Red &amp;  White Cab Co.,  as a  private\n\nentity, cannot be sued for alleged  constitutional violations\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.    1983.  See Jackson v.  Metropolitan Edison\r                                                                         \n\nCo., 419  U.S. 345, 350 (1974) (the fact  that a business may\r               \n\nbe  subject to  state regulation  is not  enough to  turn its\n\nactions  into  those of  the state  for  purposes of  a civil\n\nrights suit).\n\n          Further, under the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n\na person such as appellant may  not assert a cause of  action\n\nfor damages.  The  Act specifies that the remedies  set forth\n\nin  42  U.S.C.     2000a-3(a)  are  the  ones  available  for\n\nviolations of  the Act.   See  42 U.S.C.    12188(a)(1).   In\r                                         \n\nturn,    2000a-3(a)  provides for  an action  for \"preventive\n\nrelief,\"  including  requests  for injunctions  or  temporary\n\nrestraining  orders.  Damages are not a remedy under   2000a-\n\n3(a).  Newman v.

See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n715, 726 (1966).\n\n          Based on  the foregoing, we affirm  the judgment of\r                                                        \n\nthe district court.
