This is  an  appeal under\n                                   \n\nBatson  v. Kentucky, 476 U.S.  79 (1986), from  the trial court's\n                   \n\nallowance  of a  prosecutor's peremptory  challenge to  a Spanish\n\nsurnamed  juror.  Finding that  it was not  clearly erroneous for\n\nthe trial court to  reject appellant's claim that the  strike was\n\nracially motivated, we affirm the judgment of conviction.\n\n     During  jury selection  in  a  drug  conspiracy  prosecution\n\nagainst appellant and several  co-defendants, all bearing Spanish\n\nsurnames, one of  the first twelve  names drawn was that  of Ruth\n\nSantiago.    At  sidebar  the  court  questioned  several  of the\n\nprospective jurors and excused three.   Then the government moved\n\nto strike Ms. Santiago.  The following colloquy took place.\n\n     MR. LIBBY:     The government would strike No. 40, Juror \n                    No. 3.\n\n     MR. BROWN:     Your Honor, note my  objection to that.  This\n                    woman is the only  Spanish surnamed person on\n                    this jury list.\n\n     THE COURT:     Perhaps  Mr.  Libby  would explain  why  he's\n                    challenging that juror.\n\n     MR. LIBBY:     Has nothing  to  do with  her  surname,  your\n                    Honor.   We note that in  discussion with co-\n                    counsel,  she's  a  receptionist   at  Boston\n                    Housing Authority.\n\n     THE COURT:     Therefore?\n\n     MR. LIBBY:     Therefore, we believe that if she's in the \n                    inner city, she may have, who knows, more \n                    contact with seeing drugs in BHA operated \n                    apartments.  Who knows how that cuts?  It has\n                    nothing to do with the basis of her surname.\n\n     MR. GILLESPIE: Join in the objection.\n\n     MR. GEDIMAN:   I would like to join in the objection.\n\n     MR. KERNER:    Outrageous, your Honor.\n\n                               -2-\n\n     MR. GEDIMAN:   Outrageous.  The reasoning makes no sense.\n\n     MR. BROWN:     Case  law is  very clear,  as you  know, your\n                    Honor.\n\n     MR. LIBBY:     Can you give us a second?\n\n     [Pause.]\n\n     MR. LIBBY:     Your   Honor,   government's  objection   has\n                    nothing to  do with her surname,  we stand on\n                    the strike.\n\n     THE COURT:     I understand.  The defendants have any?\n\n     MR. BROWN:     Just a few, your Honor.\n\n     Jury selection  then continued,  the  government making  one\n\nother peremptory challenge and  one of appellant's  co-defendants\n\nmaking several.   After  making the defendants'  final collective\n\nperemptory challenge, co-defendant's counsel asked for additional\n\nchallenges \"[i]n  light of the government's  outrageous strike of\n\nthe only Hispanic surname[d] person of the jury.\"  The court gave\n\none  additional   challenge,  saying,  \"[n]ot   because  of   any\n\noutrageousness, but general sense of fairness.\"  Finally,  a jury\n\nof  twelve  and two  alternates  was  chosen,  and,  without  any\n\nobjection, sworn.\n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\n     A  three  part test  is  used to  evaluate  equal protection\n\nchallenges to  a prosecutor's  exercise of peremptory  strikes of\n\npotential jurors.   Batson, 476  U.S. at 96-98.   Initially,  the\n                          \n\nburden is upon the defendant  to make a prima facie  showing that\n\nthe prosecutor has struck a potential  juror because of race.  At\n\nthe second stage, once a prima  facie case has been made out, the\n\nburden  shifts to  the  prosecutor to  articulate a  race-neutral\n\n                               -3-\n\nexplanation  for   the  strike.    Finally,   if  the  prosecutor\n\narticulates  a race-neutral  reason, the  trial court  is charged\n\nwith deciding  whether the defendant  has carried  his burden  of\n\nproving that the strike constituted purposeful  discrimination on\n\nthe basis of race.  See Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358-\n                                             \n\n59 (1991) (citing Batson).    We  pass,   without  analysis,  the\n                        \n\nquestion  whether  appellant had  made a  prima facie  showing of\n\nintentional  discrimination, inasmuch  as the  prosecutor offered\n\nhis  explanation  and  the  trial   court,  by  its  comment,  \"I\n\nunderstand,\"  and  its   upholding  of  the  challenged   strike,\n\neffectively  \"ruled  on  the  ultimate  question  of  intentional\n\ndiscrimination.\"  Hernandez,  500 U.S. at 359.   Whether or not a\n                           \n\nprima facie showing of discrimination was made is therefore moot.\n\n     The next step of  the inquiry is whether the  prosecutor met\n\nhis burden  of articulating a race-neutral basis for striking Ms.\n\nSantiago.   In this context, an explanation may be \"race neutral\"\n\neven though  it does  not produce uniform  results across  racial\n\nlines.  See  id. at 362 (\"[D]isparate  impact . .  . will not  be\n                \n\nconclusive in the preliminary  race-neutrality step of the Batson\n                                                                 \n\ninquiry.\").   Rather, an explanation is race neutral simply if it\n\nis\n\n     based on something  other than the  race of the  juror.\n     At  this step of the  inquiry, the issue  is the facial\n     validity  of the  prosecutor's explanation.   Unless  a\n     discriminatory intent is  inherent in the  prosecutor's\n     explanation,  the  reason offered  will be  deemed race\n     neutral.\n\nId.  at 360.  Here,  the prosecutor's stated  reason for striking\n   \n\nMs. Santiago was  that her  employment as a  receptionist at  the\n\n                               -4-\n\nBoston Housing Authority in the \"inner city\" may have exposed her\n\nto drugs.  Regardless  of whether one accepts  that this was  the\n\nprosecutor's true  motive, on its  face this explanation  is race\n\nneutral.  First, it  is based on \"something other\"  than the race\n\nof the  juror.   Second,  racially discriminatory  intent is  not\n\ninherent  in striking a potential juror, in a drug trial, because\n\nof suspicion of possible exposure to drugs during employment at a\n\ncity  housing authority.    Said differently,  this same  concern\n\nmight  motivate exercise  of  a peremptory  challenge  to a  non-\n\nHispanic potential juror as well.1  \n\n     We  note that  this  explanation certainly  might have  been\n                                                      \n\noffered  as pretext  to  cover the  prosecutor's  true intent  to\n\nstrike Ms.  Santiago because  she was  Hispanic.  Indeed,  \"inner\n\ncity exposure to drugs\" is quite susceptible to impermissible use\n\nas proxy  for the  race-based exercise of  peremptory challenges.\n\nBut, at the  second stage of the Batson inquiry,  we believe that\n                                       \n\nthis explanation  falls within the Supreme  Court's definition of\n\nbeing  race neutral.   The  fact that,  if this  explanation were\n\napplied  generally, it  may serve  to exclude  a disproportionate\n\nnumber  of  minority  jurors,  is used  only  \"as  circumstantial\n\nevidence of discriminatory intent at the third stage and not as a\n\n                    \n\n     1    Appellant claims that  the prosecutor's explanation was\nfacially   pretextual,  laying   particular  emphasis   upon  the\nprosecutor's reference  to Ms. Santiago's residence  as being \"in\nthe inner city.\"  On appeal, he now identifies for the first time\ntwo other jurors without Spanish surnames with jobs or residences\nat inner city  locations.   But appellant's focus  on inner  city\nliving skips  over the prosecutor's stated  apprehension that the\nchallenged  juror, because of her job as a receptionist, may have\nhad \"more contact with seeing drugs in BHA operated apartments.\"\n\n                               -5-\n\ncontrolling  legal factor  in  the  second.\"   United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nUwaezhoke, 995 F.2d 388, 393 (3d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.\n                                                         \n\nCt. 920 (1994). \n\n     At  the third stage, once the defendant's burden to make out\n\na  prima facie case and  the prosecutor's burden  to articulate a\n\nrace- neutral explanation for the strike have been met, it is for\n\nthe  trial court to decide  the ultimate question  of whether the\n\ndefendant has proved  that the prosecutor's strike was,  in fact,\n\nmotivated by race.  Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 359; Batson,  476 U.S.\n                                                      \n\nat 98.   In other words,  the trial court must  choose whether to\n\nbelieve the prosecutor's race-neutral explanation or to find that\n\nthe explanation  was pretext to  cover race-based motives.   This\n\ndetermination turns upon  an assessment of the credibility of the\n\nprosecutor's  explanation, the  \"best evidence\"  of  which \"often\n\nwill  be  the  demeanor   of  the  attorney  who  exercises   the\n\nchallenge.\"   Hernandez, 500 U.S.  at 365.   Since \"evaluation of\n                       \n\nthe  prosecutor's   state  of   mind  based  upon   demeanor  and\n\ncredibility lies `peculiarly within the trial judge's province,'\"\n\nid.  (quoting Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 428 (1985)), \"the\n                                \n\ntrial court's  decision on  the ultimate issue  of discriminatory\n\nintent  represents a finding of  fact of the  sort accorded great\n\ndeference  on appeal.\"   Id.  at 364.   We  would reverse  such a\n                            \n\nfinding only if it is clearly erroneous.  Id. at 369.\n                                             \n\n     Here, appellant's  co-defendant raised the  Batson challenge\n                                                       \n\nand the trial  court elicited  from the  prosecutor his  facially\n\nrace-neutral  explanation  for the  strike.    Several other  co-\n\n                               -6-\n\ndefendants, including  appellant, then  joined in  the objection.\n\nAfter  conferring,  government  prosecutors  reiterated  that the\n\nstrike was  not race based,  and, apparently  confident that  the\n\nexplanation already given was  sufficient, stated that they would\n\n\"stand  on the  strike.\"   The  court  responded by  stating,  \"I\n\nunderstand,\" and proceeded to  ask defendants if they elected  to\n\nexercise any of their remaining peremptory challenges.  \n\n     In  effect,   therefore,   the  court   denied   defendants'\n\nchallenge,   presumably   crediting   the  prosecution's   stated\n\nexplanation  and finding  that the  strike was  not impermissibly\n\nmotivated.  The district judge, who may  have been aware of major\n\nareas of  drug activity in the  Boston area, and who  was able to\n\nassess the  prosecutor's demeanor  at the moment  the explanation\n\nwas  given, evidently believed  that the  stated reason  had some\n\nbasis in fact.  We cannot say that the prosecutor's stated reason\n\nwas  so illogical that it failed, as  a matter of law, to support\n\nthe trial judge's finding.   As in Hernandez, \"[t]he  trial court\n                                            \n\ndid not commit  clear error  in choosing to  believe the  reasons\n\ngiven by the prosecutor.\"  Hernandez, 350 U.S. at 372.\n                                    \n\n     Although we uphold the  judgment in this case, as  a general\n\nmatter  district  courts should  articulate  the  bases of  their\n\nfactual findings  related to Batson challenges  more clearly than\n                                   \n\noccurred here.  Specifically, especially in the face of continued\n\ndisagreement by  defense counsel,  a district court  should state\n\nwhether  it finds the proffered reason for a challenged strike to\n\nbe  facially race neutral or inherently discriminatory and why it\n\n                               -7-\n\nchooses to credit or discredit the given explanation.  Indicating\n\nthese  findings  on  the  record has  several  salutary  effects.\n\nFirst,  it fosters  confidence in  the administration  of justice\n\nwithout  racial animus.  Second,  it eases appellate  review of a\n\ntrial court's Batson ruling.   Most importantly, it ensures  that\n                    \n\nthe  trial   court  has  indeed  made   the  crucial  credibility\n\ndetermination that is afforded such great respect on appeal.  \n\n     The fact that no  such express findings were made  here does\n\nnot convince us to reverse.  We  note that this is the first time\n\nour Circuit has announced the desirability of express Batson fact\n                                                            \n\nfindings.  Moreover, after  the court allowed Ms. Santiago  to be\n\nstruck without  making express fact  findings, just as  in United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Pulgarin, 955 F.2d 1, 1  (1st Cir. 1992), \"[t]here was\n                   \n\nno  further comment from defense counsel by way of elaboration of\n\nhis  thought, objection,  dissatisfaction  with the  prosecutor's\n\nexplanation,  or  request for  examination.\"   At that  point, if\n\ndefense  counsel felt that the trial court had failed to actually\n\nassess the prosecutor's credibility or  had made a precipitous or\n\nerroneous  judgment, it  should have pointed  this out.   Counsel\n\ncould   have  explained   why  the  prosecutor's   rationale  was\n                             \n\n\"outrageous,\"  \"made  no  sense,\"  and  did  not  deserve  to  be\n\ncredited.    The  prosecutor   then  could  have  elaborated  his\n\nreasons2 and the court presumably  would have expressly made  the\n\n                    \n\n     2    Indeed, in  oral argument before us  the prosecutor did\nelaborate on the  reason for  his association  of BHA  apartments\nwith  possible exposure  to drugs:  The United  States Attorney's\nOffice had,  in the  prior year,  been  engaged in  a major  drug\nprosecution  against  more  than   fifty  defendants  accused  of\n\n                               -8-\n\nabove  two findings.  Since defendant failed to pursue the matter\n\nfurther  at voir dire, upsetting the judgment  for lack of a more\n\ndetailed explanation by the  trial court in this case  would make\n\nlittle sense.    \n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\ncarrying  on their  organized  operations out  of Boston  Housing\nAuthority apartments.   Ostensibly,  if defense counsel  had more\nextensively argued that the  proffered reason was pretextual, the\nprosecutor  might have informed the  trial judge of  this fact as\nwell.\n\n                               -9-\n",

Batson, 476 U.S. at 96-98, 106 S.Ct. at 1722-24.   Initially, the burden is upon the defendant to make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has struck a potential juror because of race.  At the second stage, once a prima facie case has been made out, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for the strike.  Finally, if the prosecutor articulates a race-neutral reason, the trial court is charged with deciding whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving that the strike constituted purposeful discrimination on the basis of race.  See Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358-59, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1865-66, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (citing Batson ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pass, without analysis, the question whether appellant had made a prima facie showing of intentional discrimination, inasmuch as the prosecutor offered his explanation and the trial court, by its comment, \"I understand,\" and its upholding of the challenged strike, effectively \"ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination.\"  Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 359, 111 S.Ct. at 1866.   Whether or not a prima facie showing of discrimination was made is therefore moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step of the inquiry is whether the prosecutor met his burden of articulating a race-neutral basis for striking Ms. Santiago.  In this context, an explanation may be \"race neutral\" even though it does not produce uniform results across racial lines.  See id. at 362, 111 S.Ct. at 1867 (\"[D]isparate impact ... will not be conclusive in the preliminary race-neutrality step of the Batson inquiry.\").  Rather, an explanation is race neutral simply if it is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>based on something other than the race of the juror.  At this step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor's explanation.  Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor's explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 360, 111 S.Ct. at 1866.   Here, the prosecutor's stated reason for striking Ms. Santiago was that her employment as a receptionist at the Boston Housing Authority in the \"inner city\" may have exposed her to drugs.  Regardless of whether one accepts that this was the prosecutor's true motive, on its face this explanation is race neutral.  First, it is based on \"something other\" than the race of the juror.  Second, racially discriminatory intent is not inherent in striking a potential juror, in a drug trial, because of suspicion of possible exposure to drugs during employment at a city housing authority.  Said differently, this same concern might motivate exercise of a peremptory challenge to a non-Hispanic potential juror as well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that this explanation certainly might have been offered as pretext to cover the prosecutor's true intent to strike Ms. Santiago because she was Hispanic.  Indeed, \"inner city exposure to drugs\" is quite susceptible to impermissible use as proxy for the race-based exercise of peremptory challenges.  But, at the second stage of the Batson inquiry, we believe that this explanation falls within the Supreme Court's definition of being race neutral.  The fact that, if this explanation were applied generally, it may serve to exclude a disproportionate number of minority jurors, is used only \"as circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent at the third stage and not as a controlling legal factor in the second.\"  United States v. Uwaezhoke, 995 F.2d 388, 393 (3d Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 920, 127 L.Ed.2d 214 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the third stage, once the defendant's burden to make out a prima facie case and the prosecutor's burden to articulate a race-neutral explanation for the strike have been met, it is for the trial court to decide the ultimate question of whether the defendant has proved that the prosecutor's strike was, in fact, motivated by race.  Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 359, 111 S.Ct. at 1866;  Batson, 476 U.S. at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1723-24.   In other words, the trial court must choose whether to believe the prosecutor's race-neutral explanation or to find that the explanation was pretext to cover race-based motives.  This determination turns upon an assessment of the credibility of the prosecutor's explanation, the \"best evidence\" of which \"often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.\"  Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 365, 111 S.Ct. at 1869.   Since \"evaluation of the prosecutor's state of mind based upon demeanor and credibility lies 'peculiarly within the trial judge's province,' \" id.  (quoting Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 428, 105 S.Ct. 844, 854, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985)), \"the trial court's decision on the ultimate issue of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact of the sort accorded great deference on appeal.\"  Id. at 364, 111 S.Ct. at 1868.   We would reverse such a finding only if it is clearly erroneous.  Id. at 369, 111 S.Ct. at 1871.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, appellant's co-defendant raised the Batson challenge and the trial court elicited from the prosecutor his facially race-neutral explanation for the strike.  Several other co-defendants, including appellant, then joined in the objection.  After conferring, government prosecutors reiterated that the strike was not race based, and, apparently confident that the explanation already given was sufficient, stated that they would \"stand on the strike.\"   The court responded by stating, \"I understand,\" and proceeded to ask defendants if they elected to exercise any of their remaining peremptory challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In effect, therefore, the court denied defendants' challenge, presumably crediting the prosecution's stated explanation and finding that the strike was not impermissibly motivated.  The district judge, who may have been aware of major areas of drug activity in the Boston area, and who was able to assess the prosecutor's demeanor at the moment the explanation was given, evidently believed that the stated reason had some basis in fact.  We cannot say that the prosecutor's stated reason was so illogical that it failed, as a matter of law, to support the trial judge's finding.  As in Hernandez, \"[t]he trial court did not commit clear error in choosing to believe the reasons given by the prosecutor.\"  Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 372, 111 S.Ct. at 1873.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we uphold the judgment in this case, as a general matter district courts should articulate the bases of their factual findings related to Batson challenges more clearly than occurred here.  Specifically, especially in the face of continued disagreement by defense counsel, a district court should state whether it finds the proffered reason for a challenged strike to be facially race neutral or inherently discriminatory and why it chooses to credit or discredit the given explanation.  Indicating these findings on the record has several salutary effects.  First, it fosters confidence in the administration of justice without racial animus.  Second, it eases appellate review of a trial court's Batson ruling.  Most importantly, it ensures that the trial court has indeed made the crucial credibility determination that is afforded such great respect on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that no such express findings were made here does not convince us to reverse.  We note that this is the first time our Circuit has announced the desirability of express Batson fact findings.  Moreover, after the court allowed Ms. Santiago to be struck without making express fact findings, just as in United States v. Pulgarin, 955 F.2d 1, 1 (1st Cir.1992), \"[t]here was no further comment from defense counsel by way of elaboration of his thought, objection, dissatisfaction with the prosecutor's explanation, or request for examination.\"   At that point, if defense counsel felt that the trial court had failed to actually assess the prosecutor's credibility or had made a precipitous or erroneous judgment, it should have pointed this out.  Counsel could have explained why the prosecutor's rationale was \"outrageous,\" \"made no sense,\" and did not deserve to be credited.  The prosecutor then could have elaborated his reasons<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the court presumably would have expressly made the above two findings.  Since defendant failed to pursue the matter further at voir dire, upsetting the judgment for lack of a more detailed explanation by the trial court in this case would make little sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellant claims that the prosecutor's explanation was facially pretextual, laying particular emphasis upon the prosecutor's reference to Ms. Santiago's residence as being \"in the inner city.\"   On appeal, he now identifies for the first time two other jurors without Spanish surnames with jobs or residences at inner city locations.  But appellant's focus on inner city living skips over the prosecutor's stated apprehension that the challenged juror, because of her job as a receptionist, may have had \"more contact with seeing drugs in BHA operated apartments.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Indeed, in oral argument before us the prosecutor did elaborate on the reason for his association of BHA apartments with possible exposure to drugs:  The United States Attorney's Office had, in the prior year, been engaged in a major drug prosecution against more than fifty defendants accused of carrying on their organized operations out of Boston Housing Authority apartments.  Ostensibly, if defense counsel had more extensively argued that the proffered reason was pretextual, the prosecutor might have informed the trial judge of this fact as well</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Said differently, this same concern might motivate exercise of a peremptory challenge to a non-Hispanic potential juror as well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that this explanation certainly might have been offered as pretext to cover the prosecutor's true intent to strike Ms. Santiago because she was Hispanic.  Indeed, \"inner city exposure to drugs\" is quite susceptible to impermissible use as proxy for the race-based exercise of peremptory challenges.  But, at the second stage of the Batson inquiry, we believe that this explanation falls within the Supreme Court's definition of being race neutral.  The fact that, if this explanation were applied generally, it may serve to exclude a disproportionate number of minority jurors, is used only \"as circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent at the third stage and not as a controlling legal factor in the second.\"  United States v.

In other words, the trial court must choose whether to believe the prosecutor's race-neutral explanation or to find that the explanation was pretext to cover race-based motives.  This determination turns upon an assessment of the credibility of the prosecutor's explanation, the \"best evidence\" of which \"often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112601\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hernandez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112601/hernandez-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. at 1869.

Several other co-defendants, including appellant, then joined in the objection.  After conferring, government prosecutors reiterated that the strike was not race based, and, apparently confident that the explanation already given was sufficient, stated that they would \"stand on the strike.\"   The court responded by stating, \"I understand,\" and proceeded to ask defendants if they elected to exercise any of their remaining peremptory challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In effect, therefore, the court denied defendants' challenge, presumably crediting the prosecution's stated explanation and finding that the strike was not impermissibly motivated.  The district judge, who may have been aware of major areas of drug activity in the Boston area, and who was able to assess the prosecutor's demeanor at the moment the explanation was given, evidently believed that the stated reason had some basis in fact.  We cannot say that the prosecutor's stated reason was so illogical that it failed, as a matter of law, to support the trial judge's finding.  As in Hernandez, \"[t]he trial court did not commit clear error in choosing to believe the reasons given by the prosecutor.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112601\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hernandez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112601/hernandez-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 111 S.Ct. at 1873.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we uphold the judgment in this case, as a general matter district courts should articulate the bases of their factual findings related to Batson challenges more clearly than occurred here.  Specifically, especially in the face of continued disagreement by defense counsel, a district court should state whether it finds the proffered reason for a challenged strike to be facially race neutral or inherently discriminatory and why it chooses to credit or discredit the given explanation.  Indicating these findings on the record has several salutary effects.  First, it fosters confidence in the administration of justice without racial animus.  Second, it eases appellate review of a trial court's Batson ruling.  Most importantly, it ensures that the trial court has indeed made the crucial credibility determination that is afforded such great respect on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that no such express findings were made here does not convince us to reverse.  We note that this is the first time our Circuit has announced the desirability of express Batson fact findings.  Moreover, after the court allowed Ms. Santiago to be struck without making express fact findings, just as in United States v. Pulgarin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576726\"><a href=\"/opinion/576726/united-states-v-hernan-pulgarin/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 1 (1st Cir.1992), \"[t]here was no further comment from defense counsel by way of elaboration of his thought, objection, dissatisfaction with the prosecutor's explanation, or request for examination.\"   At that point, if defense counsel felt that the trial court had failed to actually assess the prosecutor's credibility or had made a precipitous or erroneous judgment, it should have pointed this out.  Counsel could have explained why the prosecutor's rationale was \"outrageous,\" \"made no sense,\" and did not deserve to be credited.  The prosecutor then could have elaborated his reasons<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the court presumably would have expressly made the above two findings.  Since defendant failed to pursue the matter further at voir dire, upsetting the judgment for lack of a more detailed explanation by the trial court in this case would make little sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellant claims that the prosecutor's explanation was facially pretextual, laying particular emphasis upon the prosecutor's reference to Ms. Santiago's residence as being \"in the inner city.\"   On appeal, he now identifies for the first time two other jurors without Spanish surnames with jobs or residences at inner city locations.  But appellant's focus on inner city living skips over the prosecutor's stated apprehension that the challenged juror, because of her job as a receptionist, may have had \"more contact with seeing drugs in BHA operated apartments.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Indeed, in oral argument before us the prosecutor did elaborate on the reason for his association of BHA apartments with possible exposure to drugs:  The United States Attorney's Office had, in the prior year, been engaged in a major drug prosecution against more than fifty defendants accused of carrying on their organized operations out of Boston Housing Authority apartments.  Ostensibly, if defense counsel had more extensively argued that the proffered reason was pretextual, the prosecutor might have informed the trial judge of this fact as well</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
