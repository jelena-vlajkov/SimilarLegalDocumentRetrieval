Appellant Southeast Transport  Corporation\n               \n\nappeals  a judgment by  the United States  District Court for\n\nthe District  of Massachusetts in  the amount of  $15,000 for\n\nappellee  Geraldine  Fox and  in  the amount  of  $20,000 for\n\nappellee  Melinda St.  John, and  the award  to appellees  of\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees.  We summarily affirm.\n\n                              I\n\n     Fox  and  St.  John  were hired  by  appellant  as truck\n\ndrivers in June 1988.  They were both terminated on August 11\n\nof the same year.   In 1989, appellees brought  suit alleging\n\nthat appellant had discriminated against each \"based upon her\n\nsex in the terms and conditions of her employment by creating\n\na  hostile,  offensive  and   abusive  work  environment  and\n\nterminating her employment\" in violation of 42 U.S.C.   2000e\n\nand Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B.   In July 1991, the court entered\n\na  default judgment  against defendant,  pursuant to  Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P.  55(a).   The  court  then conducted  an  evidentiary\n\nhearing  to determine  the  amount  to  be  awarded  to  each\n\nappellee in damages.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2).  \n\n     Plaintiffs  sought  damages  for  emotional  distress on\n\ntheir  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  151B claim.   They  also requested\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees.   Each of the appellees testified\n\nat the hearing, as did two witnesses for the  defendant.  The\n\ncourt detailed  its findings and conclusions  in a memorandum\n\nand order dated December 9, 1993.  \n\n                             -2-\n\n     On appeal, appellant  asserts two assignments of  error.\n\nFirst,  appellant claims that  certain testimony  received by\n\nthe court at the evidentiary  hearing should have been barred\n\nas hearsay, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence,  which\n\nappellant contends apply to hearings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.  55(b).    Second,   appellant  contends  that  there  was\n\ninsufficient  evidence  presented  to sustain  the  award  of\n\ndamages to each appellee.\n\n                              II\n\n     Once   the  default   judgment   had  entered,   it  was\n\nestablished, as alleged in  the complaint, that the appellant\n\nhad discriminated  against the  appellees both by  creating a\n\nhostile work environment and  by terminating their employment\n\nbecause they were women.   See Riehle v. Margolies,  279 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n218, 225 (1929).  Therefore, the only issue to be  decided at\n\nthe  Rule 55(b)(2) hearing was the amount of damages to which\n\nappellees were  entitled as  a result of  appellant's illegal\n\nconduct.   See Jones v.  Winnepesaukee Realty, 990  F.2d 1, 4\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).    In its memorandum  and order, the  court,\n\nas  required, stated  its findings  of fact  and conclusions.\n\nSee Brown v.  Kenron Aluminum  &amp; Glass Corp.,  477 F.2d  526,\n                                           \n\n530-31 (8th  Cir. 1973); Foxtrap, Inc. v.  Foxtrap, Inc., 671\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 636,  638 n.1 (D.C.  Cir. 1982).   The court  found that\n\nappellees were credible witnesses.   It also concluded, based\n\nin part on  its assessment of credibility, that the appellees\n\n                             -3-\n\nhad  suffered \"significant  emotional  distress\"  because  of\n\nspecific illegal  conduct  by the  appellant and,  therefore,\n\nwere entitled to  damages under Mass. Gen. L. ch.  151B.  See\n                                                             \n\nBuckley  Nursing Home,  Inc. v. Massachusetts  Comm'n Against\n                                                             \n\nDiscrimination, 20 Mass.

See Cumpiano  v.

Furthermore, in light\n\nof the  court's findings and given that damages for emotional\n\ndistress  are  \"not easily  computed  and, therefore,  .  . .\n\nextremely fact-sensitive,\" we find  no abuse of discretion in\n\nthe court's assessment of  damages in this case.   Jones, 990\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 5  (upholding an award  for emotional  damages based\n\nmainly   on  defendant's  statement   of  damages  and  sworn\n\ntestimony).\n\n                             -4-\n\n     Finally, we  find no evidence, and  appellant has called\n\nour attention to  none, which would indicate that  the court,\n\nin  its  factual  findings  and  conclusions,  explicitly  or\n\nimplicitly relied  on any  of  the statements  alleged to  be\n\nhearsay.   Therefore, even if we were to assume arguendo both\n                                                        \n\nthat  the Federal  Rules of  Evidence apply  to a  hearing to\n\ndetermine  damages  and  that  the  testimony  challenged  by\n\nappellant  was  inadmissible   hearsay,  any  error  in   the\n\nadmission which  may have occurred was harmless.

It also concluded, based in part on its assessment of credibility, that the appellees had suffered \"significant emotional distress\" because of specific illegal conduct by the appellant and, therefore, were entitled to damages under Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  151B. See Buckley Nursing Home, Inc. v.  Massachusetts Comm'n Against Discrimination, 20 Mass.

See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir. 1990) (an appellate court \"ought not to upset findings of fact or conclusions drawn therefrom unless, on the whole of the record, [the appellate judges] form a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made\").  Furthermore, in light of the court's findings and given that damages for emotional distress are \"not easily computed and, therefore, ... extremely fact-sensitive,\" we find no abuse of discretion in the court's assessment of damages in this case.   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603794\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Jones,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/603794/catherine-m-jones-v-winnepesaukee-realty/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">5</span> </a></span>(upholding an award for emotional damages based mainly on defendant's statement of damages and sworn testimony).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we find no evidence, and appellant has called our attention to none, which would indicate that the court, in its factual findings and conclusions, explicitly or implicitly relied on any of the statements alleged to be hearsay.  Therefore, even if we were to assume arguendo both that the Federal Rules of Evidence apply to a hearing to determine damages and that the testimony challenged by appellant was inadmissible hearsay, any error in the admission which may have occurred was harmless.
