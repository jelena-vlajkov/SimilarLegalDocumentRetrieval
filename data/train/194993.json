Petitioner seeks review of the May 6,\n                     \n\n1993 order of the Board  of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying\n\npetitioner's motion to reopen deportation proceedings so that\n\npetitioner   might  apply   for  discretionary   relief  from\n\ndeportation.   We  summarily  affirm the  May 6,  1993 order,\n\ngrant  the INS's  motion to  dissolve the  automatic  stay of\n\ndeportation, and  deny petitioner's motion to  hold appellate\n\nproceedings in abeyance.\n\n                              I\n\n     Petitioner  was  ordered  deported  after  he failed  to\n\nappear  at  a  deportation hearing  or  present  any defense.\n\nPetitioner promptly  appealed to the BIA and  moved to reopen\n\nthe deportation  proceedings so  that petitioner might  apply\n\nfor discretionary  relief  from  deportation.    Petitioner's\n\nmotion to reopen,  filed by his first counsel, indicated that\n\npetitioner had not received notice of the deportation hearing\n\nbecause  INS correspondence  had been  sent to an  address at\n\nwhich petitioner \"was not residing at the time of delivery.\"\n\n     The BIA dismissed  the appeal and denied reopening.   In\n\nso doing, it  pointed out that petitioner's  motion to reopen\n\nhad  not  been  accompanied  by  affidavits  and  evidentiary\n\nmaterial  as required  by  8  C.F.R.    3.8(a)  and that  the\n\naddress petitioner had stated in his notice of appeal was the\n\nvery address to which INS correspondence had been sent.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     Petitioner, represented  by new counsel,  promptly moved\n\nto  reopen  once again,  this  time  filing affidavits.    He\n\nclaimed he had never told  his first counsel that he did  not\n\nlive  at the  address to  which INS  correspondence had  been\n\nsent;   he  simply  had  not  received   any  notice  of  the\n\ndeportation hearing.  Petitioner's mother stated by affidavit\n\nthat she had the only key to the residence's mailbox and she,\n\ntoo,  had not  received notice  of  the deportation  hearing.\n\nPetitioner argued he  should not be  penalized for his  first\n\ncounsel's failings.\n\n     Concluding  that petitioner  had  not complied  with the\n\nrequirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I &amp; N Dec. 637\n                                          \n\n(BIA  1988),  for  seeking  reopening based  on  a  claim  of\n\nineffective   assistance   of   counsel,   the   BIA   denied\n\npetitioner's motion to reopen.  Petitioner now seeks judicial\n\nreview of that decision.\n\n                              II\n\n     In Matter of Lozada, 19 I &amp; N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), where\n                        \n\nan  appeal  from  a  deportation  order  had  been  summarily\n\ndismissed because no brief had  been filed, the BIA announced\n\na  \"high standard\"  for motions  seeking  reopening based  on\n\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel:\n\n     A  motion  based   upon  a  claim  of   ineffective\n     assistance  of counsel  should be  supported  by an\n     affidavit  of  the allegedly  aggrieved  respondent\n     attesting  to  the  relevant facts.    In  the case\n     before   us,  that   affidavit  should   include  a\n     statement that  sets forth in detail  the agreement\n\n                             -3-\n\n     that  was entered  into  with  former counsel  with\n     respect to the  actions to be  taken on appeal  and\n     what  counsel did  or  did  not  represent  to  the\n     respondent  in this  regard.   Furthermore,  before\n     allegations  of  ineffective assistance  of  former\n     counsel are presented to  the Board, former counsel\n     must be informed of the allegations and allowed the\n     opportunity to  respond.   Any subsequent  response\n     from counsel,  or report  of  counsel's failure  or\n     refusal to respond,  should be  submitted with  the\n     motion.   Finally,  if it  is  asserted that  prior\n     counsel's handling of the case involved a violation\n     of  ethical or  legal responsibilities,  the motion\n     should reflect  whether a complaint  has been filed\n     with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding\n     such representation, and if not, why not.\n\n          The high standard announced here is  necessary\n     if we  are  to  have  a  basis  for  assessing  the\n     substantial  number  of  claims   of    ineffective\n     assistance of  counsel that come  before the Board.\n     Where  essential  information  is  lacking,  it  is\n     impossible to evaluate the substance of such claim.\n     In the instant  case, for  example, the  respondent\n     has not alleged, let alone established, that former\n     counsel ever agreed to prepare a  brief on appeal .\n     . ..  The requirement that disciplinary authorities\n     be notified of breaches of professional conduct not\n     only   serves   to   deter   meritless  claims   of\n     ineffective representation but  also highlights the\n     standards which should be expected of attorneys who\n     represent persons in immigration proceedings . . ..\n\n     The  BIA  concluded  petitioner had  not  complied  with\n\nLozada as petitioner had not detailed his agreement  with his\n      \n\nfirst counsel, had  not shown whether  he had notified  first\n\ncounsel of  his charges, and  had failed to state  whether he\n\nhad filed a disciplinary complaint.\n\n     The   BIA  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in  denying\n\npetitioner's motion to reopen.  First, petitioner's affidavit\n\nwas very  sketchy in  describing his  arrangement with  first\n\ncounsel.   Petitioner stated that within a  week of receiving\n\n                             -4-\n\nan order to show cause why he should not be deported,  he had\n\ncontacted counsel, whom, petitioner claimed \"had already been\n\npaid  for this  case\"; counsel  had  said not  to worry;  and\n\npetitioner  \"was under  the  impression\" that  counsel  would\n\nenter an appearance.  After  receiving a copy of the decision\n\nordering deportation, petitioner had again contacted counsel.\n\nCounsel had again  told petitioner not to worry  and that \"he\n\nwould get  me my United States citizenship.\" One of counsel's\n\nemployees then helped petitioner file a notice of appeal, and\n\npetitioner paid the employee $620.  \n\n     The BIA  could reasonably conclude  that petitioner  had\n\nnot  sufficiently  detailed   his  agreement  with   counsel.\n\nPetitioner  asserted that  counsel had  been  paid for  \"this\n\ncase,\"  yet petitioner was  only \"under the  impression\" that\n\ncounsel  would  file  an appearance.    Petitioner  failed to\n\ndetail what counsel actually agreed to do with respect to the\n\ndeportation proceedings. \n\n     Second, petitioner  failed timely  to show  that he  had\n\nnotified first counsel of his  allegations against him.  In a\n\nsupplement to  his motion  to reopen,  petitioner claimed  to\n\nhave  notified counsel  by letter and  purported to  attach a\n\ncopy  of the letter,  but failed to  do so.   Even though the\n\nBIA's  May 6,  1993 order  put  petitioner on  notice of  the\n\nletter's omission,  petitioner  apparently did  not submit  a\n\ncopy until  over three  months later with  the filing  of his\n\n                             -5-\n\nthird  motion to reopen.   Such piecemeal  presentation, with\n\nits potential for  an unwarrantable delay of  deportation, is\n\nwhat Lozada's \"high standard\" is aimed at preventing.\n             \n\n     Third,  petitioner refused to state whether he had filed\n\ndisciplinary proceedings  against his  counsel.   He  claimed\n\nthat   \"Supreme  Court   Rule   No.   4221,   regarding   the\n\nconfidentiality of  Disciplinary Complaints\" barred  him from\n\nsaying whether  a complaint had  been filed.   Petitioner did\n\nnot attach a copy of the rule from which the BIA could make a\n\ndetermination   whether   petitioner's   interpretation   was\n\nwarranted.1 \n\n     In  view of  the motion's  deficiencies,  the BIA  acted\n\nwithin its discretion in denying reopening.\n\n                             III\n\n     Petitioner asks  that we  hold appellate  proceedings in\n\nabeyance until the  BIA acts on a third  motion for reopening\n\npetitioner  filed through  a third  counsel  in August  1993.\n\nBecause  of     1105a's  automatic  stay,  holding  appellate\n\nproceedings  in  abeyance  would  be  tantamount  to  staying\n\ndeportation  pending  determination   of  petitioner's  third\n\nmotion to reopen. After reviewing the motion and the relevant\n\n                    \n\n1.  Petitioner has apparently abandoned his interpretation of\nthe Rhode Island rule, for in his third  motion to reopen, he\nindicates  he filed a complaint against first counsel in late\nJuly,  almost  two months  after  the BIA  denied  the second\nmotion  to  reopen.    The  disciplinary  complaint  is  very\nsketchy.\n\n                             -6-\n\nconsiderations, see  Berroteran-Melendez v. I.N.S.,  955 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1251,  1255 (9th  Cir.  1992), we  decline  to stay  judicial\n\nproceedings.    We note that petitioner has  requested a stay\n\nof deportation  from the BIA, and we think  the BIA is in the\n\nbest position to assess whether such relief is warranted.\n\n     The May 6,  1993 order denying reopening is affirmed and\n\nthe I.N.S.'s motion to lift the automatic stay is granted. \n\n                             -7-\n",

He  claimed\n\nthat   \"Supreme  Court   Rule   No.   4221,   regarding   the\n\nconfidentiality of  Disciplinary Complaints\" barred  him from\n\nsaying whether  a complaint had  been filed.   Petitioner did\n\nnot attach a copy of the rule from which the BIA could make a\n\ndetermination   whether   petitioner's   interpretation   was\n\nwarranted.1 \n\n     In  view of  the motion's  deficiencies,  the BIA  acted\n\nwithin its discretion in denying reopening.\n\n                             III\n\n     Petitioner asks  that we  hold appellate  proceedings in\n\nabeyance until the  BIA acts on a third  motion for reopening\n\npetitioner  filed through  a third  counsel  in August  1993.\n\nBecause  of     1105a's  automatic  stay,  holding  appellate\n\nproceedings  in  abeyance  would  be  tantamount  to  staying\n\ndeportation  pending  determination   of  petitioner's  third\n\nmotion to reopen. After reviewing the motion and the relevant\n\n                    \n\n1.  Petitioner has apparently abandoned his interpretation of\nthe Rhode Island rule, for in his third  motion to reopen, he\nindicates  he filed a complaint against first counsel in late\nJuly,  almost  two months  after  the BIA  denied  the second\nmotion  to  reopen.    The  disciplinary  complaint  is  very\nsketchy.\n\n                             -6-\n\nconsiderations, see  Berroteran-Melendez v.
