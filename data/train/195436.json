This appeal asks us\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                      \n\nto determine  whether the  district court failed  to consider\n\nsubsection (b)(1)  of U.S.S.G.   3E1.1  in denying defendant-\n\nappellant,  Clifford Tapia, an additional one-level reduction\n\nin  his offense  level  for  acceptance  of  responsibility.1\n\nBecause it is likely that the court never  considered Tapia's\n\neligibility for  the extra reduction under    3E1.1(b)(1), we\n\nvacate his sentence and remand so that the district court can\n\napply that guideline.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          In February 1993 a grand jury returned a four-count\n\nindictment that charged Tapia  with possession of heroin with\n\n(1)  intent  to  distribute  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.   \n\n841(a)(1); (2) possession of a firearm during and in relation\n\nto  a  drug trafficking  crime in  violation  of 18  U.S.C.  \n\n924(c);  (3)  being a  felon in  possession  of a  firearm in\n\nviolation  of 18  U.S.C.    922(g); and  (4) possession  of a\n\nfirearm  with  an altered  serial number  in violation  of 18\n\nU.S.C.   922(k).   Tapia informed the government that  he was\n\nwilling to plead guilty to the first, third and fourth counts\n\n                    \n\n1.  The November  1993 edition  of the guidelines  applied in\nthis  case.  See United States v. Quinones, No. 93-1601, slip\n                                          \nop. at  2 n.1 (1st Cir.  May 20, 1994) (absent  ex post facto\nconsiderations  guidelines in  effect at  time of  sentencing\ncontrol).    All  Sentencing  Guidelines  references  in this\nopinion are to that edition.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nin consideration for the dismissal of count two, the   924(c)\n\ncount,  which carried a  mandatory minimum jail  term of five\n\nyears.   The government  declined to accept  this conditional\n\nplea, and Tapia proceeded to trial on all four counts.\n\n          Trial  commenced on  September  27, 1993.   On  the\n\nsecond day  of trial, after  the government  had rested,  the\n\nparties entered into a plea agreement whereby Tapia agreed to\n\nplead guilty to counts one, three and four, in return for the\n\ngovernment's  dismissal of count two, the   924(c) count.  On\n\nNovember 23, 1993,  the district court  sentenced Tapia to  a\n\nprison term of forty-one months.2  This appeal ensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Tapia  contends that  the district  court erred  in\n\nfailing to  grant him  an additional one-level  reduction for\n\nacceptance of  responsibility.   Tapia  received a  two-level\n\nreduction under U.S.S.G.   3E1.1(a),  but claims he was  also\n\nentitled  to  an  additional  reduction of  one  level  under\n\nU.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b), which  requires the extra  reduction if\n\nthe   defendant   either   \"(1)   timely   provides  complete\n                                                             \n\ninformation to the government  concerning his own involvement\n                                                             \n\nin  the offense;  or (2) timely  notifies authorities  of his\n                    \n\n                    \n\n2.  The  district court calculated  an adjusted offense level\nof 18 and criminal history category of III.  This  produced a\nguideline  sentencing  range  of  thirty-three  to  forty-one\nmonths.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nintention to enter a  plea of guilty, thereby  permitting the\n\ngovernment to  avoid preparing  for trial and  permitting the\n\ncourt  to allocate  its  resources efficiently.\"    (Emphasis\n\nadded.)  The thrust of Tapia's argument on appeal is that the\n\ndistrict court  denied him the additional one-level deduction\n\nwithout ever considering subsection (b)(1).3\n\n          The  issue  of  whether a  defendant  has  accepted\n\nresponsibility   is  \"fact-dominated.\"     United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nMorillo,  8 F.3d 864, 871  (1st Cir. 1994);  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nDonovan, 996 F.2d  1343, 1346  (1st Cir. 1993).   It  follows\n       \n\nthat  we  generally review  a  district  court's decision  to\n\nwithhold a  three-level reduction  under   3E1.1(b)  only for\n\nclear error.   Morillo, 8 F.3d  at 871; Donovan,  996 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n1346.    Where, however,  as is  the  case here,  an improper\n\napplication of  the Guidelines is alleged,  no such deference\n\nis warranted.  United States v. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301, 307 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir.  1994).  The question  is not whether  Tapia satisfied  \n\n3E1.1(b)(1)'s  strictures,  but  whether the  district  court\n\naddressed the issue at all.\n\n          The government  contends  that the  district  court\n\n\"expressly  address[ed]\"  the     3E1.1(b)(1)  question  \"and\n\nimplicitly   found  the  Defendant's  cooperation  less  than\n\ncomplete.\"   This  characterization of  the district  court's\n\n                    \n\n3.  Tapia recognizes that he  is ineligible for the reduction\nunder   3E1.1(b)(2).\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nruling  is both  logically inconsistent  and contrary  to the\n\nrecord.  It is clear that, despite defense counsel's explicit\n\nrequest that  the district court consider    3E1.1(b)(1), the\n\ncourt  focussed solely on the timing of Tapia's plea, i.e.,  \n                                                          \n\n3E1.1(b)(2), in declining to  award the additional  one-level\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility:\n\n          It  seems  to  me  that  the  significant\n          language  of this  guideline is  the word\n          \"timely\"  and  that  it  must be  a  rare\n          circumstance   indeed    that   where   a\n          Defendant pleads, not admits,  but pleads\n          to  a charge  after trial  has commenced,\n          indicates that the trial was required for\n          purposes    of   bargaining    with   the\n          government with respect to another charge\n          to  which  he did  not  plead ultimately,\n          that could  hardly be  said to be  timely\n          under any circumstances.\n\nTranscript of  Sentencing Hearing at 11-12.  In denying Tapia\n\nthe additional one-level reduction, the court never made even\n\na veiled reference  to the timeliness or the  completeness of\n\nthe information provided by Tapia to the government, which is\n\nthe  express  subject  of     3E1.1(b)(1).    The  government\n\nessentially  asks us  to play  the role  of mind  readers and\n\ndivine  something in  the  district court's  remarks that  is\n\nsimply not there.  We decline to do so.\n\n          It   seems  probable  that   the  district  court's\n\noversight   stemmed  from   a  similar   deficiency   in  the\n\npresentence  investigation report  (PSI).    The initial  PSI\n\nrecommended  a   two-level   reduction  for   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility and  found that  Tapia was  not entitled  to a\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nthree-level  reduction  because he  did not  enter a  plea of\n\nguilty at a sufficiently  early point in the process  so that\n\nthe government  could avoid  preparing for  a trial,  and the\n\ncourt could  schedule its calendar efficiently.   Tapia filed\n\nan objection to the  report claiming that he was  entitled to\n\nthe  extra  reduction  because,   inter  alia,  \"he  provided\n                                             \n\ncomplete  information to  the government  concerning his  own\n\ninvolvement  in  the  offense.\"    An  addendum  to  the  PSI\n\nresponded that  Tapia was not entitled to the extra one-level\n\nreduction  because he did not  enter a guilty  plea until the\n\nsecond day of trial, and therefore did \"not allow[] the court\n\nto  use its  resources efficiently.\"   The  PSI's failure  to\n\naddress Tapia's    3E1.1(b)(1)  argument was repeated  by the\n\nsentencing judge.\n\n          Because  the  district  court  failed  to  consider\n\nTapia's eligibility for an extra one-level reduction pursuant\n\nto U.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b)(1), Tapia's  sentence cannot  stand.4\n\nWe  therefore vacate the sentence and remand the case so that\n                                                             \n\nthe district court may consider whether Tapia is eligible for\n                                                             \n\nthe additional reduction of one level under   3E1.1(b)(1).\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n4.  We express no opinion  as to the merits of  Tapia's claim\nthat  he is  entitled to  the additional  one-level reduction\navailable under that guideline.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n",

May 20, 1994) (absent  ex post facto\nconsiderations  guidelines in  effect at  time of  sentencing\ncontrol).    All  Sentencing  Guidelines  references  in this\nopinion are to that edition.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nin consideration for the dismissal of count two, the   924(c)\n\ncount,  which carried a  mandatory minimum jail  term of five\n\nyears.   The government  declined to accept  this conditional\n\nplea, and Tapia proceeded to trial on all four counts.\n\n          Trial  commenced on  September  27, 1993.   On  the\n\nsecond day  of trial, after  the government  had rested,  the\n\nparties entered into a plea agreement whereby Tapia agreed to\n\nplead guilty to counts one, three and four, in return for the\n\ngovernment's  dismissal of count two, the   924(c) count.  On\n\nNovember 23, 1993,  the district court  sentenced Tapia to  a\n\nprison term of forty-one months.2  This appeal ensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Tapia  contends that  the district  court erred  in\n\nfailing to  grant him  an additional one-level  reduction for\n\nacceptance of  responsibility.   Tapia  received a  two-level\n\nreduction under U.S.S.G.   3E1.1(a),  but claims he was  also\n\nentitled  to  an  additional  reduction of  one  level  under\n\nU.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b), which  requires the extra  reduction if\n\nthe   defendant   either   \"(1)   timely   provides  complete\n                                                             \n\ninformation to the government  concerning his own involvement\n                                                             \n\nin  the offense;  or (2) timely  notifies authorities  of his\n                    \n\n                    \n\n2.  The  district court calculated  an adjusted offense level\nof 18 and criminal history category of III.  This  produced a\nguideline  sentencing  range  of  thirty-three  to  forty-one\nmonths.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nintention to enter a  plea of guilty, thereby  permitting the\n\ngovernment to  avoid preparing  for trial and  permitting the\n\ncourt  to allocate  its  resources efficiently.\"    (Emphasis\n\nadded.)  The thrust of Tapia's argument on appeal is that the\n\ndistrict court  denied him the additional one-level deduction\n\nwithout ever considering subsection (b)(1).3\n\n          The  issue  of  whether a  defendant  has  accepted\n\nresponsibility   is  \"fact-dominated.\"     United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nMorillo,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871  (1st Cir. 1994);  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nDonovan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610557\"><a href=\"/opinion/610557/united-states-v-richard-j-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1346  (1st Cir. 1993).   It  follows\n       \n\nthat  we  generally review  a  district  court's decision  to\n\nwithhold a  three-level reduction  under   3E1.1(b)  only for\n\nclear error.   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morillo,</span> <span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  at <span class=\"page\">871</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610557\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Donovan,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/610557/united-states-v-richard-j-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at\n                                               \n\n<span class=\"page\">1346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.    Where, however,  as is  the  case here,  an improper\n\napplication of  the Guidelines is alleged,  no such deference\n\nis warranted.  United States v.

The question  is not whether  Tapia satisfied  \n\n3E1.1(b)(1)'s  strictures,  but  whether the  district  court\n\naddressed the issue at all.\n\n          The government  contends  that the  district  court\n\n\"expressly  address[ed]\"  the     3E1.1(b)(1)  question  \"and\n\nimplicitly   found  the  Defendant's  cooperation  less  than\n\ncomplete.\"   This  characterization of  the district  court's\n\n                    \n\n3.  Tapia recognizes that he  is ineligible for the reduction\nunder   3E1.1(b)(2).\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nruling  is both  logically inconsistent  and contrary  to the\n\nrecord.  It is clear that, despite defense counsel's explicit\n\nrequest that  the district court consider    3E1.1(b)(1), the\n\ncourt  focussed solely on the timing of Tapia's plea, i.e.,  \n                                                          \n\n3E1.1(b)(2), in declining to  award the additional  one-level\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility:\n\n          It  seems  to  me  that  the  significant\n          language  of this  guideline is  the word\n          \"timely\"  and  that  it  must be  a  rare\n          circumstance   indeed    that   where   a\n          Defendant pleads, not admits,  but pleads\n          to  a charge  after trial  has commenced,\n          indicates that the trial was required for\n          purposes    of   bargaining    with   the\n          government with respect to another charge\n          to  which  he did  not  plead ultimately,\n          that could  hardly be  said to be  timely\n          under any circumstances.\n\nTranscript of  Sentencing Hearing at 11-12.  In denying Tapia\n\nthe additional one-level reduction, the court never made even\n\na veiled reference  to the timeliness or the  completeness of\n\nthe information provided by Tapia to the government, which is\n\nthe  express  subject  of     3E1.1(b)(1).    The  government\n\nessentially  asks us  to play  the role  of mind  readers and\n\ndivine  something in  the  district court's  remarks that  is\n\nsimply not there.  We decline to do so.\n\n          It   seems  probable  that   the  district  court's\n\noversight   stemmed  from   a  similar   deficiency   in  the\n\npresentence  investigation report  (PSI).    The initial  PSI\n\nrecommended  a   two-level   reduction  for   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility and  found that  Tapia was  not entitled  to a\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nthree-level  reduction  because he  did not  enter a  plea of\n\nguilty at a sufficiently  early point in the process  so that\n\nthe government  could avoid  preparing for  a trial,  and the\n\ncourt could  schedule its calendar efficiently.   Tapia filed\n\nan objection to the  report claiming that he was  entitled to\n\nthe  extra  reduction  because,   inter  alia,  \"he  provided\n                                             \n\ncomplete  information to  the government  concerning his  own\n\ninvolvement  in  the  offense.\"    An  addendum  to  the  PSI\n\nresponded that  Tapia was not entitled to the extra one-level\n\nreduction  because he did not  enter a guilty  plea until the\n\nsecond day of trial, and therefore did \"not allow[] the court\n\nto  use its  resources efficiently.\"   The  PSI's failure  to\n\naddress Tapia's    3E1.1(b)(1)  argument was repeated  by the\n\nsentencing judge.\n\n          Because  the  district  court  failed  to  consider\n\nTapia's eligibility for an extra one-level reduction pursuant\n\nto U.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b)(1), Tapia's  sentence cannot  stand.4\n\nWe  therefore vacate the sentence and remand the case so that\n                                                             \n\nthe district court may consider whether Tapia is eligible for\n                                                             \n\nthe additional reduction of one level under   3E1.1(b)(1).\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n4.  We express no opinion  as to the merits of  Tapia's claim\nthat  he is  entitled to  the additional  one-level reduction\navailable under that guideline.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n</pre>",
