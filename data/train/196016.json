Pro  se petitioner  Robert Beauchamp\r                                            \n\nseeks a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial by\n\nthe  district  court  of  his  petition  for  habeas  corpus,\n\npursuant  to  28 U.S.C.     2254.   In  order to  justify the\n\nissuance of  a certificate of probable  cause, Beauchamp must\n\n\"make  a 'substantial  showing  of the  denial  of a  federal\n\nright.'\"    Barefoot v.  Estelle,  463 U.S.  880,  893 (1983)\r                                            \n\n(quoting Stewart v.  Beto, 454  F.2d 268, 270  n.2 (5th  Cir.\r                                     \n\n1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 925 (1972)).  We have carefully\r                               \n\nreviewed the record, Beauchamp's memorandum, and the  opinion\n\nof the  district  court.   We  conclude that  petitioner  has\n\nfailed to make  a substantial  showing that he  was denied  a\n\nfederal right.\n\n          First,  Beauchamp  claims  he was  entitled  to  an\n\nevidentiary hearing on his claim that he was denied effective\n\nassistance  of counsel  because his  trial counsel  failed to\n\ninterview or call as  witnesses two men who had  indicated to\n\npolice  that they  had heard  the victim say  negative things\n\nabout Beauchamp.  At trial, Beauchamp argued that he slew the\n\nvictim  in  self-defense.     Under  Massachusetts  law,  the\n\nadequacy of a claim of  self-defense rests on a determination\n\nof the mental state and the  actions of the defendant \"at the\n\ntime of the  alleged assault.\"  Commonwealth  v. Baseler, 419\r                                                                    \n\nMass. 500, 503 &amp; n.3, 645 N.E.2d 1179 &amp; n.3 (1995).  However,\n\n\"evidence  of  a  victim's  threats  of  violence  against  a\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndefendant\"  is admissible  for showing  a defendant  acted in\n\nself-defense.   Commonwealth v.  Fontes, 396 Mass.  733, 735,\r                                                   \n\n488 N.E.2d 760, 762 (1986).\n\n          While  the  statements of  the  potential witnesses\n\nindicate they were aware  of some hostility between Beauchamp\n\nand the  victim, their  statements concern events  too remote\n\nfrom the time of the slaying to shed any light on Beauchamp's\n\nmental state or action at the time of the killing.  Moreover,\n\nneither statement contains anything which could  be construed\n\nas a \"threat of violence\" against Beauchamp.  Since Beauchamp\n\nhas  not shown \"a  reasonable probability that,  [but for his\n\ncounsel's failure to call these  as witnesses], the result of\n\nthe proceeding would have  been different,\" Beauchamp has not\n\nmade a  substantial showing  that he  was denied  his federal\n\nright  to effective  assistance  of counsel.   See  Scarpa v.\r                                                                      \n\nDubois,  38  F.3d 1,  8  (1st Cir.  1994)  (habeas petitioner\r                  \n\nalleging ineffective  counsel in  state court must  show both\n\nthat counsel's performance  was below professional  norms and\n\nthat  petitioner  suffered  prejudice  as  result  of  error)\n\n(quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984)),\r                                             \n\ncert. denied,  115 S.Ct.  940 (1995).   Moreover,  since this\r                        \n\nclaim  could adequately  be  resolved  on  the basis  of  the\n\nrecord, Beauchamp was not  entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\non it.  See Perron  v. Perrin,  742 F.2d 669,  672 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \n\n1984).\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Beauchamp  also  asserts  that  his  constitutional\n\nrights   were  violated  because   coercion  by  the  Central\n\nIntelligence Agency prevented him from presenting a  truthful\n\naccount of the  killing at his  trial.  We have  reviewed the\n\nrecord carefully, including Beauchamp's numerous submissions.\n\nLike the  Massachusetts Superior  Court, we  find Beauchamp's\n\ntale to consist of  \"transparent implausibilities.\"  Order on\n\nDefendant's  Motion in Aid  of Discovery;   see Machibroda v.\r                                                                      \n\nUnited States,  368 U.S. 487, 495 (1962) (in reviewing habeas\r                         \n\npetitions,  courts are  not  stripped of  \"all discretion  to\n\nexercise their  common sense\"). The district  court was under\n\nno  obligation  to  accord  an evidentiary  hearing  to  such\n\n\"inherently incredible\"  allegations.  Neron v.  Tierney, 841\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  1197, 1202 n.6 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,  488 U.S. 832\r                                                          \n\n(1988).\n\n          Finally, we are barred from considering Beauchamp's\n\nclaim that the trial court improperly instructed  the jury by\n\nplacing the burden of  proving self-defense on the defendant.\n\nThe  Massachusetts courts  found  these  claims  procedurally\n\nbarred  because they were  not raised during  the pendency of\n\nBeauchamp's second  motion for a  new trial.1   Beauchamp has\n\nnot shown  that his failure  to raise  this issue was  due to\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Since Beauchamp  had no  right to  counsel in  this post-\nconviction   proceeding,  he   cannot   claim   he   received\nconstitutionally  ineffective  assistance  of counsel  during\nthis  proceeding.   Coleman v.  Thompson,  501 U.S.  722, 752\r                                                    \n(1991).\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nsome factor external to  his defense.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span> </span>(1995).  Moreover, since this claim could adequately be resolved on the basis of the record, Beauchamp was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on it.  See Perron v. Perrin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"440436\"><a href=\"/opinion/440436/donald-b-perron-v-everett-i-perrin-jr-warden-new-hampshire-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span>, 672 (1st Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beauchamp also asserts that his constitutional rights were violated because coercion by the Central Intelligence Agency prevented him from presenting a truthful account of the killing at his trial.  We have reviewed the record carefully, including Beauchamp's numerous submissions.  Like the Massachusetts Superior Court, we find Beauchamp's tale to consist of \"transparent implausibilities.\"  Order on Defendant's Motion in Aid of Discovery;  see Machibroda v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106335\"><a href=\"/opinion/106335/machibroda-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 495 (1962) (in reviewing habeas petitions, courts are not stripped of \"all discretion to exercise their common sense\").  The district court was under no obligation to accord an evidentiary hearing to such \"inherently incredible\" allegations.  Neron v.

The Massachusetts courts found these claims procedurally barred because they were not raised during the pendency of Beauchamp's second motion for a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Beauchamp has not shown that his failure to raise this issue was due to some factor external to his defense.  See Murray v. Carrier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111727\"><a href=\"/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 488 (1986) (to establish adequate cause for his procedural default, petitioner must show it was caused by \"some objective factor external to the defense\").  Nor has he brought forth credible evidence that he is \"actually innocent\" of the charge for which he is incarcerated.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111727\"><a href=\"/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 496 </a></span>(federal court may review habeas petition despite procedural default in state court where it is probable that violation led to conviction of one \"actually innocent\" of the crime).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for a certificate of probable cause is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Since Beauchamp had no right to counsel in this post- conviction proceeding, he cannot claim he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel during this proceeding.
