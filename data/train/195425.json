Guido Impemba appeals from a district court\n               \n\norder denying his motion  to vacate a pair of  criminal fines\n\nimposed  nearly ten years ago.  For the following reasons, we\n\nsummarily affirm under Loc. R. 27.1.  \n\n                              I.\n\n     In 1983 and 1984, Impemba participated in a wide-ranging\n\nscheme  to   transport  approximately  twenty-five   tons  of\n\nmarijuana  from  Colombia  to   Maine  aboard  the  freighter\n\n\"Adina.\"    He  was later  convicted  on  two  counts of  (1)\n\nconspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute and\n\n(2) conspiracy to import  marijuana.  At sentencing,  held on\n\nDecember 20,  1984,1 Impemba received  a fifteen-year  prison\n\nterm  and  a  $50,000  committed  fine  on  Count  I,  and  a\n\nconcurrent  five-year prison  term and  a  concurrent $15,000\n\ncommitted fine on  Count II.  This  court thereafter affirmed\n\nhis conviction (along with those of six of his codefendants).\n\nSee  United States v. Cresta,  825 F.2d 538  (1st Cir. 1987),\n                            \n\ncert. denied, 486 U.S. 1042 (1988).\n            \n\n     In  March  1993, Impemba  filed  the  instant motion  to\n\nvacate  his  fines  in  Maine  district   court.    He  there\n\ncomplained that the  sentencing court had  imposed the  fines\n\nwithout considering his financial status.  He further alleged\n\nthat he had been  indigent in 1984 and  had remained so  ever\n\nsince--with  the  result  that,  because of  the  \"committed\"\n\nnature  of   the  fines,   he   was  faced   with   \"extended\n\nimprisonment\" due solely  to his indigency,  in violation  of\n\nconstitutional  guarantees.    The  district  judge summarily\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  government's brief  contains mistaken  references to\n1985 as the year of sentencing. \n\ndenied this motion  shortly after  its filing.   Five  months\n\nlater, in an  independent action in the judicial  district in\n\nwhich he  was incarcerated, Impemba obtained  relief from the\n\n\"committed\"  nature of  his  fines.   Based  on his  oath  of\n\nindigency, a magistrate-judge sitting in the Western District\n\nof Wisconsin relieved him \"from payment of the committed fine\n\nas a condition of his release from prison.\"  This order  made\n\nclear, however,  that Impemba  remained obligated to  pay the\n\nfines and  that the government could pursue civil remedies to\n\nobtain payment.   While this  action has mooted  part of  his\n\nmotion to vacate,  Impemba on appeal continues to  pursue his\n\nchallenge to the validity of the fines themselves.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Impemba  has  not  explained,  and  the  government  has\n\nproperly  questioned,   the  jurisdictional  basis   for  his\n\nrequested  relief.2  For example, to the extent his motion is\n\nviewed  as one to correct sentence under former Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 35(a), it was untimely.   As he is contending not that the\n\nsentence was \"illegal,\" but rather that it was \"imposed in an\n\nillegal manner,\" any  such motion was subject to  the 120-day\n\nfiling period specified in Rule 35(b).  Alternatively, to the\n\nextent his motion  is viewed  as a habeas  petition under  28\n\nU.S.C.    2255,  Impemba arguably  lacked standing  to pursue\n\n                    \n\n2.  Impemba's brief  contains no statement of  subject matter\nand appellate jurisdiction,  in violation of Fed. R.  App. P.\n28(a)(2). \n\n                             -4-\n\nsuch relief prior to expiration of his \"noncontingent\" prison\n\nterm  and/or  exhaustion  of  his   administrative  remedies.\n\nUnited States v. Levy, 897 F.2d 596, 598 (1st Cir. 1990).  In\n                     \n\nany event, any such request would now be moot in light of the\n\nWisconsin court's action.  Finally,  to the extent his motion\n\nis viewed as a request for remission under former 18 U.S.C.  \n\n3573,  the action was plainly  unauthorized.  As explained in\n\nUnited  States v. Linker, 920 F.2d 1,  1-2 (7th Cir. 1990), a\n                        \n\nversion  of  this  statute  permitting a  defendant  to  seek\n\nremission  of a fine was  in existence for  only six weeks in\n\n1987.  A  newer version,  which took effect  on December  12,\n\n1987 and which applies to all fines \"irrespective of the date\n\nof imposition,\"  permits such  relief only upon  \"petition of\n\nthe Government.\"\n\n     Yet  we need  not  resolve these  matters  (nor need  we\n\naddress  the government's  related  contention  that  Impemba\n\nwaived  the issue by failing  to raise it  on direct appeal),\n\ninasmuch as  the motion  to vacate  is  obviously lacking  in\n\nmerit.   Impemba principally relies on a former version of 18\n\nU.S.C.   3565(a)(1) which provided as follows: \n\n     If  the  court  finds  by a  preponderance  of  the\n                                                        \n     information  relied upon in  imposing sentence that\n                                                        \n     the defendant has the present ability to pay a fine\n                                                        \n     or  penalty, the  judgment may  direct imprisonment\n                                                        \n     until the fine or penalty is paid, and the issue of\n                                      \n     execution on  the judgment shall not  discharge the\n     defendant from imprisonment until the amount of the\n     judgment is paid.\n\n                             -5-\n\n(Emphasis  added.)   The  crux of  his  argument is  that the\n\nsentencing   court  lacked  any   information  to  support  a\n\nconclusion that he had the \"present ability\" to pay the fines\n\nin  question.   This contention fails  for the  simple reason\n\nthat  the underscored  language  did not  apply to  Impemba's\n\ncase.   Added by the  Criminal Fine Enforcement  Act of 1984,\n\nPub.  L. No.  98-596,    2(2), 98  Stat. 3134,  this language\n\napplied only to \"offenses committed after December 31, 1984.\"\n\nId.    10, 98 Stat. 3138.   The version of    3565(a)(1) that\n   \n\ngoverned  Impemba's  case   contained  no  requirement   that\n\nimposition of a committed  fine be dependent on a  finding of\n\n\"present ability\" to pay.3\n\n     Under  the law  applicable  to  Impemba, therefore,  the\n\nsentencing  court  was  under   no  statutory  obligation  to\n\nconsider ability  to pay.   Indeed, before the  Criminal Fine\n\nEnforcement  Act (and  thereafter the  Sentencing Guidelines)\n\n                    \n\n3.  This earlier version read simply as follows:\n\n     Where the  judgment directs imprisonment  until the\n     fine  or  penalty imposed  is  paid,  the issue  of\n     execution on the  judgment shall not discharge  the\n     defendant from imprisonment until the amount of the\n     judgment is paid.\n\n     Impemba  makes  reference  to  two  other  statutes that\nspecify  various factors  (including ability  to pay)  that a\ncourt  must consider  in imposing a  fine.  See  18 U.S.C.   \n                                               \n3622(a), 3572(a).   As  he acknowledges, however,  neither of\nthese  applied to his case.  Section 3622 was applicable only\nto offenses committed  after December 31,  1984.  See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \nUnited States v. Wilfred Amer. Educ. Corp., 953 F.2d 717, 719\n                                          \nn.1 (1st Cir. 1992).  Section 3572 took effect on November 1,\n1987. \n\n                             -6-\n\ntook effect, a  sentencing court  had virtually  unreviewable\n\ndiscretion  in  imposing  a  sentence  within  the  statutory\n\nmaximum.   See, e.g.,  United States  v. Dominguez,  951 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n412, 416  (1st  Cir.  1991)  (summarily  rejecting  allegedly\n\nindigent defendant's challenge to pre-Guidelines fine), cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied, 112 S. Ct. 1960 (1992).  A \"narrow exception\" to this\n      \n\nrule permitted the overturning of a sentence \"where the facts\n\nindicate that  the court  below adopted a  rigid, mechanistic\n\napproach to sentencing, and failed to consider the individual\n\nmitigating circumstances  of each defendant.\"   United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Jimenez-Rivera,  842  F.2d  545, 548  (1st  Cir.),  cert.\n                                                             \n\ndenied,  487  U.S. 1223  (1988).   Yet  the sentence  here is\n      \n\nimmune from any such challenge.  The district court  properly\n\nconsidered the individual circumstances presented--observing,\n\nfor  example,   that  Impemba  was  \"one   of  the  principal\n\nrepresentatives   of   the  group   anticipating   profit  in\n\nsubstantial  amounts,\" and  later rejecting  the government's\n\nrecommendation that  consecutive sentences  be  imposed.   We\n\nalso note  that Impemba  himself was largely  responsible for\n\nthe absence of precise financial  information--having refused\n\n(apparently  on  advice of  counsel)  to  submit a  financial\n\nstatement to the probation department in the belief that such\n\nrequest was an invasion of privacy. \n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -7-\n",

He further alleged\n\nthat he had been  indigent in 1984 and  had remained so  ever\n\nsince--with  the  result  that,  because of  the  \"committed\"\n\nnature  of   the  fines,   he   was  faced   with   \"extended\n\nimprisonment\" due solely  to his indigency,  in violation  of\n\nconstitutional  guarantees.    The  district  judge summarily\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  government's brief  contains mistaken  references to\n1985 as the year of sentencing. \n\ndenied this motion  shortly after  its filing.   Five  months\n\nlater, in an  independent action in the judicial  district in\n\nwhich he  was incarcerated, Impemba obtained  relief from the\n\n\"committed\"  nature of  his  fines.   Based  on his  oath  of\n\nindigency, a magistrate-judge sitting in the Western District\n\nof Wisconsin relieved him \"from payment of the committed fine\n\nas a condition of his release from prison.\"  This order  made\n\nclear, however,  that Impemba  remained obligated to  pay the\n\nfines and  that the government could pursue civil remedies to\n\nobtain payment.   While this  action has mooted  part of  his\n\nmotion to vacate,  Impemba on appeal continues to  pursue his\n\nchallenge to the validity of the fines themselves.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Impemba  has  not  explained,  and  the  government  has\n\nproperly  questioned,   the  jurisdictional  basis   for  his\n\nrequested  relief.2  For example, to the extent his motion is\n\nviewed  as one to correct sentence under former Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 35(a), it was untimely.   As he is contending not that the\n\nsentence was \"illegal,\" but rather that it was \"imposed in an\n\nillegal manner,\" any  such motion was subject to  the 120-day\n\nfiling period specified in Rule 35(b).  Alternatively, to the\n\nextent his motion  is viewed  as a habeas  petition under  28\n\nU.S.C.    2255,  Impemba arguably  lacked standing  to pursue\n\n                    \n\n2.  Impemba's brief  contains no statement of  subject matter\nand appellate jurisdiction,  in violation of Fed. R.  App. P.\n28(a)(2). \n\n                             -4-\n\nsuch relief prior to expiration of his \"noncontingent\" prison\n\nterm  and/or  exhaustion  of  his   administrative  remedies.\n\nUnited States v.

In\n                     \n\nany event, any such request would now be moot in light of the\n\nWisconsin court's action.  Finally,  to the extent his motion\n\nis viewed as a request for remission under former 18 U.S.C.  \n\n3573,  the action was plainly  unauthorized.  As explained in\n\nUnited  States v. Linker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552268\"><a href=\"/opinion/552268/united-states-v-dennis-w-linker/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1-2 (7th Cir. 1990), a\n                        \n\nversion  of  this  statute  permitting a  defendant  to  seek\n\nremission  of a fine was  in existence for  only six weeks in\n\n1987.  A  newer version,  which took effect  on December  12,\n\n1987 and which applies to all fines \"irrespective of the date\n\nof imposition,\"  permits such  relief only upon  \"petition of\n\nthe Government.\"\n\n     Yet  we need  not  resolve these  matters  (nor need  we\n\naddress  the government's  related  contention  that  Impemba\n\nwaived  the issue by failing  to raise it  on direct appeal),\n\ninasmuch as  the motion  to vacate  is  obviously lacking  in\n\nmerit.   Impemba principally relies on a former version of 18\n\nU.S.C.   3565(a)(1) which provided as follows: \n\n     If  the  court  finds  by a  preponderance  of  the\n                                                        \n     information  relied upon in  imposing sentence that\n                                                        \n     the defendant has the present ability to pay a fine\n                                                        \n     or  penalty, the  judgment may  direct imprisonment\n                                                        \n     until the fine or penalty is paid, and the issue of\n                                      \n     execution on  the judgment shall not  discharge the\n     defendant from imprisonment until the amount of the\n     judgment is paid.\n\n                             -5-\n\n(Emphasis  added.)   The  crux of  his  argument is  that the\n\nsentencing   court  lacked  any   information  to  support  a\n\nconclusion that he had the \"present ability\" to pay the fines\n\nin  question.   This contention fails  for the  simple reason\n\nthat  the underscored  language  did not  apply to  Impemba's\n\ncase.   Added by the  Criminal Fine Enforcement  Act of 1984,\n\nPub.  L. No.  98-596,    2(2), 98  Stat. 3134,  this language\n\napplied only to \"offenses committed after December 31, 1984.\"\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552268\"><a href=\"/opinion/552268/united-states-v-dennis-w-linker/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>    10, 98 </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">Stat. 3138.   The version of    3565(a)(1) that\n   \n\ngoverned  Impemba's  case   contained  no  requirement   that\n\nimposition of a committed  fine be dependent on a  finding of\n\n\"present ability\" to pay.3\n\n     Under  the law  applicable  to  Impemba, therefore,  the\n\nsentencing  court  was  under   no  statutory  obligation  to\n\nconsider ability  to pay.   Indeed, before the  Criminal Fine\n\nEnforcement  Act (and  thereafter the  Sentencing Guidelines)\n\n                    \n\n3.  This earlier version read simply as follows:\n\n     Where the  judgment directs imprisonment  until the\n     fine  or  penalty imposed  is  paid,  the issue  of\n     execution on the  judgment shall not discharge  the\n     defendant from imprisonment until the amount of the\n     judgment is paid.\n\n     Impemba  makes  reference  to  two  other  statutes that\nspecify  various factors  (including ability  to pay)  that a\ncourt  must consider  in imposing a  fine.

Section 3622 was applicable only\nto offenses committed  after December 31,  1984.  See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \nUnited States v. Wilfred Amer. Educ.
