Nowd faults  the district\r\n\ncourt  ruling in  two respects.   First,  he contends  that Lewis\r                                                                           \r\n\nmisconstrued the ADEA attorney fee  provision.  Second, he argues\r\n\nthat the Lewis reasoning  does not extend to the  dissimilar EAJA\r                        \r\n\nattorney fee provision.1 \r\n\nA.   The ADEA\r          A.   The ADEA\r                       \r\n\n          Congress  enacted  the ADEA  in  1967  to enable  legal\r\n\nrecourse   by  private   sector   employees   subjected  to   age\r\n\ndiscrimination in  the workplace, see Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1We review the challenged statutory interpretations de novo.\r                                                                          \r\nSee Riva v. Commonwealth  of Mass., 61 F.3d 1003,  1007 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n1995).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n575, 577-81 (1978),  by providing that  \"the court[s] shall  have\r\n\njurisdiction  to grant such legal  or equitable relief  as may be\r                                                                           \r\n\nappropriate to  effectuate the purposes of  [the ADEA], including\r                     \r\n\nwithout limitation judgments compelling employment, reinstatement\r\n\nor  promotion.\" 29 U.S.C.   626(b) (emphasis added); see also id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n   626(c)(1) (\"Any person aggrieved  may bring a  civil action in\r\n\nany court  . .  .  for such  legal or  equitable  relief as  will\r                                                                           \r\n\neffectuate  the purposes  of  this  chapter.\") (emphasis  added).\r                                                     \r\n\nADEA   626(b) expressly incorporated particular provisions of the\r\n\nFair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), including FLSA   216(b)  which\r\n\nstates that \"[t]he court . . . shall, in addition to any judgment\r                                              \r\n\nawarded  to  the  plaintiff  or plaintiffs,  allow  a  reasonable\r\n\nattorney's fee to be paid by the defendant.\"  29  U.S.C.   216(b)\r\n\n(emphasis added).  \r\n\n          It was not  until 1974,  see id.    633a, that  certain\r                                                    \r\n\nfederal government employees became  entitled to protection under\r\n\nthe ADEA.  Lewis, 953  F.2d at 1281.  Moreover, Congress  did not\r                          \r\n\nexplicitly extend the  FLSA attorney fee provision,  viz., FLSA  \r\n\n216(b), to public sector  employees, as it had done  earlier with\r\n\nrespect to  private sector employees.   Id.   Finally, subsection\r                                                    \r\n\n633a(f) flatly states  that any  ADEA claim brought  by a  public\r\n\nsector employee under new section 633a is neither affected by nor\r\n\nsubject  to \"any provision  of . .  . [the ADEA],  other than the\r\n\nprovisions  of section  631(b) of  this title [pertaining  to age\r\n\nlimits] and the provisions of this section [633a].\"   29 U.S.C.  \r\n\n633a(f); see also Lewis, 953 F.2d at 1281.  \r                                 \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          Nowd  nonetheless  argues   that  subsection   633a(c),\r\n\nauthorizing \"such  legal or  equitable relief as  will effectuate\r\n\nthe purposes of [the ADEA],\"  should be read to empower an  award\r\n\nof attorney fees against the United States.  We do not agree.  \r\n\n     For  one  thing,  the  explicit  restriction  set  forth  in\r\n\nsubsection  633a(f)  at the  time  that  section 633a  (including\r\n\nsubsection 633a(c))  was enacted,  plainly provides that  section\r\n\n633a is a self-contained provision applicable exclusively to ADEA\r\n\nclaims against public sector employers.  Lewis, 953 F.2d at 1281-\r                                                        \r\n\n82;  see Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U.S. 156, 160-61 (1981) (holding\r                                     \r\n\nthat  federal employees  do  not have  the  right to  jury  trial\r\n\navailable  to private sector ADEA claimants).   Second, under the\r\n\nso-called  \"American Rule,\" parties in litigation ordinarily bear\r\n\ntheir own attorney fees.  See BTZ, Inc. v. Great Northern Nekoosa\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp.,  47  F.3d 463,  465 (1st  Cir.  1995); Committee  on Civic\r                                                                           \r\n\nRights of the  Friends of Newburyport  Waterfront v.

Third, the availability vel non of attorney fees under\r                                                    \r\n\nsection  633a  directly  implicates  the  doctrine  of  sovereign\r\n\nimmunity.  See United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754,  761 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1994) (citing  Ruckelshaus  v.

Lehman,  453 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\nat 160-61 (limiting right to jury trial under ADEA).  \r\n\n          The   generalized   language   in  subsection   633a(c)\r\n\n(authorizing \"such  legal or equitable relief  as will effectuate\r\n\nthe purposes of  [the ADEA]\") is insufficient to  overcome either\r\n\nthe  American Rule  or  sovereign immunity.    Whatever else  the\r\n\nCongress may  have intended  to  accomplish by  its enactment  of\r\n\nsubsection 633a(c), it made no  express reference to attorney fee\r                                                 \r\n\nawards  against  the  United  States.    Furthermore,  the  broad\r\n\nlanguage in subsection  633a(c) relied  on by Nowd     \"legal  or\r\n\nequitable  relief\"      cannot  be deemed  an  express  statutory\r\n\nauthorization of  attorney fee  awards against the  United States\r\n\nwithout  ignoring  Congress'  explicit incorporation  of  FLSA   \r\n\n216(b)  which specifically  provided for  attorney fee  awards in\r\n\nprivate  sector  cases,  notwithstanding  the  presence   of  the\r                                                                           \r\n\nidentical  phrase \"legal or equitable relief\" in ADEA   626(b) at\r                           \r\n\nthe time FLSA   216(b) was incorporated.  \r\n\n          Were  we to  construe  the phrase  \"legal or  equitable\r\n\nrelief\" as  encompassing attorney  fee awards against  the United\r\n\nStates, Congress'  explicit incorporation  of FLSA    216(b) into\r\n\nthe  private  sector ADEA  scheme would  be  reduced to  an empty\r\n\nexercise  and no effect  would be given to  ADEA   633a(f), which\r\n\nexpressly confines  the  federal-employee ADEA  claims  procedure\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nwithin a self-contained scheme and defines the remedial limits of\r\n\nfederal government  liability under  the ADEA.   See  Lehman, 453\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 168; see also  Rodriguez v.

Accordingly,  we affirm the  district court ruling  that\r\n\nthe ADEA  itself does not  authorize attorney fee  awards against\r\n\nthe United States. \r\n\nB.  The EAJA\r          B.

Thus, EAJA  \r                                           \r\n\n2412(b) permits an attorney  fee award against the United  States\r\n\nwhere a private litigant would  be amenable to a fee award  under\r\n\nthe  statute establishing the  particular cause of  action.  Id.;\r                                                                          \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nsee  also H.R.  Rep. No.  1418,  96th Cong.,  2d Sess.  8 (1980),\r                   \r\n\nreprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N 4984, 4987.  \r                      \r\n\n          As  noted above,  see  supra p.  3, the  ADEA expressly\r                                                \r\n\nimports various remedial provisions from the FLSA, including FLSA\r\n\n   216(b), which permits  attorney fee awards  in actions against\r\n\nprivate sector employers.  See 29 U.S.C.   626(b).  Consequently,\r                                        \r\n\na prevailing ADEA claimant  is entitled to a  reasonable attorney\r\n\nfee  award  against  a private  sector  employer.    Thus, it  is\r                                        \r\n\nentirely  consistent  with the  EAJA's  purpose  that the  United\r\n\nStates,  qua  employer, assume  responsibility  on  a \"completely\r                      \r\n\nequal  footing\"  with  private  sector  employers  in  regard  to\r\n\nattorney fee  awards under  the ADEA.   See H.R.  Rep. No.  1418,\r                                                     \r\n\nreprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 4987 (citing Natural Resources\r                                                                           \r\n\nDefense  Council  v.  E.P.A.,  484 F.2d  1331  (1st  Cir. 1973)).\r                                      \r\n\nFurther,  in keeping with the  proviso to EAJA    2412(b), ADEA  \r\n\n633a(c) cannot be said    by its silence, cf. supra  Section A   \r                                                             \r\n\nto \"expressly prohibit[]\" attorney  fee awards against the United\r\n\nStates.  See 29 U.S.C.   633a(c).  We therefore conclude that the\r                      \r\n\nEAJA   empowers  the   district   courts,  in   their  reasonable\r\n\ndiscretion, to award prevailing  ADEA claimants attorney fees and\r\n\nexpenses against the United States.  \r\n\nC.   The Nowd Application\r          C.   The Nowd Application\r                                   \r\n\n          The United States nonetheless contends that Nowd is not\r\n\nentitled  to an attorney fee award under  the EAJA, since the fee\r\n\napplication  is  deficient.   See, e.g.,  Grendel's Den,  Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLarkin, 749  F.2d  945, 952  (1st  Cir. 1984)  (noting  potential\r                \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nadverse   consequences   of   counsel's   failure   to   maintain\r\n\ncontemporaneous  time records).  As the district court has yet to\r\n\ndecide whether to exercise its discretion in this case, it should\r\n\nbe afforded an  opportunity to consider  the Nowd application  in\r\n\nthe first instance.  See Foster  v. Mydas Assocs., Inc., 943 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n139,  144-45 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (noting that determination  of fee\r\n\naward  by  appellate court  in first  instance would  usurp trial\r\n\ncourt  function); see also Grendel's  Den, Inc., 749  F.2d at 952\r                                                         \r\n\n(noting  that absence  of contemporaneous  time records  does not\r\n\ninvariably result  in total disallowance of  fee application, but\r                                                  \r\n\ninstead may  warrant only a \"substantial  reduction\").  Moreover,\r\n\nit  appears that  Nowd did  not have  an adequate  opportunity to\r\n\nrespond to the contention that the fee application was deficient.\r\n\nThe  record reveals that  the district  court disallowed  the fee\r\n\napplication,  on other  grounds,  two days  after the  government\r                                                    \r\n\nfirst opposed it as deficient in form.   As Nowd  should be given\r\n\nan opportunity  to  respond, or  amend  the fee  application,  we\r\n\nremand to  the district court for  further proceedings consistent\r\n\nwith this opinion.  \r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          In sum, we  hold that the ADEA, 29 U.S.C.    633a, does\r\n\nnot  mandate an award of  attorney fees and  expenses against the\r\n\nUnited  States  for the  benefit  of a  prevailing  public sector\r\n\nemployee, but  that the  EAJA, 28  U.S.C.    2412(b), nonetheless\r\n\npermits  a  discretionary award  of  attorney  fees and  expenses\r\n\nagainst  the United States for  the benefit of  a prevailing ADEA\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nclaimant.\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court\r                    For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court\r                                                                           \r\n\norder  and remand  for further  proceedings consistent  with this\r          order  and remand  for further  proceedings consistent  with this\r                                                                           \r\n\nopinion.  \r          opinion.  \r                 \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n",

Moreover,\r\n\nit  appears that  Nowd did  not have  an adequate  opportunity to\r\n\nrespond to the contention that the fee application was deficient.\r\n\nThe  record reveals that  the district  court disallowed  the fee\r\n\napplication,  on other  grounds,  two days  after the  government\r                                                    \r\n\nfirst opposed it as deficient in form.   As Nowd  should be given\r\n\nan opportunity  to  respond, or  amend  the fee  application,  we\r\n\nremand to  the district court for  further proceedings consistent\r\n\nwith this opinion.  \r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          In sum, we  hold that the ADEA, 29 U.S.C.    633a, does\r\n\nnot  mandate an award of  attorney fees and  expenses against the\r\n\nUnited  States  for the  benefit  of a  prevailing  public sector\r\n\nemployee, but  that the  EAJA, 28  U.S.C.    2412(b), nonetheless\r\n\npermits  a  discretionary award  of  attorney  fees and  expenses\r\n\nagainst  the United States for  the benefit of  a prevailing ADEA\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nclaimant.\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court\r                    For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court\r                                                                           \r\n\norder  and remand  for further  proceedings consistent  with this\r          order  and remand  for further  proceedings consistent  with this\r                                                                           \r\n\nopinion.  \r          opinion.  \r                 \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n</pre>",
