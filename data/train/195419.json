David Mazzone, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n                                                       \n\n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n                 Torruella, Selya and Boudin,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n                                     \n\n                                         \n\nThomas Figueroa on brief pro se.\n               \nDonald  K.  Stern,  United  States  Attorney,  and  Dina   Michael\n                                                                  \nChaitowitz, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n      \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.   Thomas Figueroa  appeals pro  se from  the\n               \n\ndenial of  his motion under 28  U.S.C.   2255  to vacate, set\n\naside, or correct his sentence.  Following his conviction for\n\nconspiracy and  attempt to possess with  intent to distribute\n\n500 or  more grams of  cocaine, petitioner received  a prison\n\nterm of  97  months.    This court  thereafter  affirmed  his\n\nconviction and his  sentence.  United States v. Figueroa, 976\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1446 (1st  Cir. 1992),  cert. denied,  113 S.  Ct. 1346\n                                          \n\n(1993).   Petitioner now raises three issues, two relating to\n\nhis sentence and a third involving his underlying conviction.\n\n     He first  contends that  the  district court  improperly\n\ncalculated  the   quantity  of  cocaine  for   which  he  was\n\nresponsible  for purposes  of sentencing.   We  rejected this\n\nidentical contention  on direct  appeal, see id.  at 1460-61,\n                                                \n\nand so  will not revisit the issue  here.  See, e.g., Barrett\n                                                             \n\nv.  United States, 965 F.2d  1184, 1190 n.11  (1st Cir. 1992)\n                 \n\n(issues decided on direct appeal  will not be reviewed  again\n\nby way of   2255 motion).  \n\n     Petitioner's  second claim involves the determination as\n\nto  his role in  the offense.  The  court reduced his offense\n\nlevel by  two levels  on the  ground  that he  was a  \"minor\"\n\nparticipant  under  U.S.S.G.     3B1.2(b).    Petitioner  now\n\nasserts that the court was  clearly erroneous in declining to\n\nimpose a four-level reduction  under   3B1.2(a) for \"minimal\"\n\nparticipation,   or  alternatively   that  his   counsel  was\n\nineffective in failing to seek such a reduction.  He contends\n\nin  this regard that  his alcoholism was  so disabling during\n\nthe relevant  period that he  was incapable of  anything more\n\nthan  tangential  involvement  in  the conspiracy.    To  the\n\ncontrary,  the  evidence  of  petitioner's  participation--as\n\nrevealed especially  in two recorded  telephone conversations\n\nhe  had  with  the  government  informant  and  as  otherwise\n\ndescribed in our earlier opinion--demonstrates  that his role\n\nwas  more considerable than he  suggests.  We  also note that\n\ncounsel  did, in  fact, initially  propose that  a four-level\n\nreduction be  applied.  We find no clear error on the part of\n\nthe  court, and  no substandard  performance on  the part  of\n\ncounsel.\n\n     Petitioner's  final argument  is difficult  to decipher.\n\nTo   the   extent   he   is   alleging   \"sentencing   factor\n\nmanipulation,\" see,  e.g., United States v.  Brewster, 1 F.3d\n                                                     \n\n51, 55 (1st  Cir. 1993),  as the district  court assumed,  we\n\nreject  such claim  for  the reasons  recited  in the  recent\n\nappeal of a codefendant.   See Figueroa v. United  States, 19\n                                                         \n\nF.3d 7, No. 93-2028, slip op. at 3-4 (1st Cir. 1994) (table).\n\nTo  the extent  he  is alleging  governmental entrapment  (or\n\nineffective assistance for failure to pursue such a defense),\n\nit  suffices  to note  that  the  record utterly  belies  any\n\nsuggestion   of   \"government   inducement\"   or   \"lack   of\n\npredisposition.\"  United  States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468\n                                           \n\n                             -3-\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (citing Jacobson v. United States, 112 S. Ct.\n                                                 \n\n1535  (1992)).   Indeed,  the two  recorded conversations  by\n\nthemselves  demonstrate that  petitioner  was anything  but a\n\nreluctant participant.   To  the  extent he  is arguing  that\n\ncounsel improperly  dissuaded him from testifying, we observe\n\nthat petitioner  personally disclaimed any interest  in doing\n\nso in response to inquiries from the court.

And\n\nto the extent  he is seeking to vacate his  conviction due to\n\nnewly discovered evidence, we reject the claim on the grounds\n\nthat it was not advanced  below and is in any  event entirely\n\nconclusory.\n\n     Finally,   as  each   of   petitioner's  claims   (where\n\npossessing the requisite factual specificity) was  subject to\n\nrefutation on the basis of the existing record, the court was\n\njustified in dismissing the petition without a hearing.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g.,  United States v.
