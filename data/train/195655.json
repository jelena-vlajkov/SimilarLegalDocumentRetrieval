Appellants  Charles\n                                         \n\nFlynn, William Kenney, and  Gary Neal were found guilty by a jury\n\non a number of criminal  charges stemming from a series of  armed\n\nrobberies that took place in New Hampshire.  Appellants challenge\n\ntheir convictions on the basis  of various pre-trial, trial,  and\n\npost-trial rulings issued by the court as well as statements made\n\nby the Government.  We affirm on all but two of the issues raised\n\nby Appellants.\n\n          The first  of these issues involves  various Jencks Act\n\nrequests  made by  Appellant  Flynn.   We  find that  the  record\n\nindicates the district judge may  have applied an erroneous legal\n\nstandard  in ruling  that  various materials  did not  qualify as\n\nstatements  under the Jencks Act.  Accordingly, we will remand to\n\nthe  district  court  for  an evidentiary  hearing  to  determine\n\nwhether statements  demanded by Appellant Flynn  should have been\n\ndisclosed under the Jencks Act and,  if so, whether nondisclosure\n\nconstituted harmless error.  We also remand to the district court\n\non  the  issue  of  the  order  of  restitution  entered  against\n\nAppellant  Neal with  instructions  that  a  hearing be  held  to\n\ndetermine whether the full amount  of monetary losses suffered by\n\nFirst New  Hampshire Bank was  caused by  the conduct  underlying\n\nNeal's convictions.  \n\n          At this  point  in the  proceedings, we  choose not  to\n\nvacate the court's Jencks Act rulings or the order of restitution\n\nbut  instead remand to the district court for the limited purpose\n\nof  making supplemental findings with regard to these two issues.\n\n                               -3-\n\nIn  the interim, we will retain appellate jurisdiction so that we\n\nmay   review  the   court's  augmented   record  and   subsequent\n\ndeterminations.\n\n                        FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n                                          \n\n          Appellants  were tried by a jury in the District of New\n\nHampshire during the months of October and November of 1992.  The\n\nevidence  presented and  believed by  the jury  demonstrated that\n\nAppellants were involved, in  varying capacities, in carrying out\n\nfive armed robberies over a  five-month period beginning with the\n\narmed robbery of a supermarket and ending in armed robbery of the\n\nFirst New Hampshire Bank (\"First  N.H.\").1  Appellants were tried\n\n                    \n\n1  Appellants were initially indicted for committing seven crimes\nwhich included:\n\n          (1) the  armed  robbery  of the  Demoulas\n              Market   Basket,  a   supermarket  in\n              Portsmouth,  New Hampshire,  on April\n              13, 1991;\n\n          (2) the armed  robbery of an  employee of\n              the Abercrombie  and Finch restaurant\n              as she was attempting to make a night\n              deposit  of $4800 at  a Fleet Bank in\n              North   Hampton,  New   Hampshire  on\n              May 19, 1991; the jury rendered a not\n              guilty  verdict  on counts  involving\n              this robbery;\n\n          (3) the armed robbery of an employee of a\n              retail  store  called the  Dress Barn\n              while she was  attempting to  deposit\n              $763  into the  night deposit  box at\n              the    First    National   Bank    of\n              Portsmouth, New Hampshire on  June 7,\n              1991;\n\n          (4) the armed robbery  on June 30,  1991,\n              of an employee of  Phantom Fireworks,\n              Inc.  in   Seabrook,  New  Hampshire;\n              counts  involving  this robbery  were\n\n                               -4-\n\non a thirty-two-count indictment charging them as follows:\n\n            Counts  1 and 2  charged Appellants Flynn\n                           \n            and   Kenney   with  violations   of  the\n            Racketeer    Influenced    and    Corrupt\n            Organizations  Act, 18  U.S.C.    1962(c)\n            and (d), with each of the seven robberies\n            alleged as predicate acts;\n\n            Count 3 charged all three Appellants with\n                   \n            conspiracy  to  commit  robbery of  First\n            N.H. in violation of 18  U.S.C.   371 and\n            18 U.S.C.   2113(a) and (d);\n\n            Counts  4 and  5 alleged  that Appellants\n                            \n            Flynn  and  Kenney  committed  armed  and\n            unarmed  bank robbery  of First  N.H., in\n            violation of 18 U.S.C.   2113(d)  and (a)\n            and 18 U.S.C.   2;\n\n            Counts  6 through 15,  17, and 18 alleged\n                                             \n            conspiracy and interference with commerce\n            by threats  or violence, in  violation of\n            the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C.   1951, with one\n            or more counts  corresponding to each  of\n            the seven robberies.  Flynn  was named in\n            all counts;  Kenney was named in counts 8\n            through 18;\n\n            Counts 16  and 20 through  25 charged the\n                                         \n            use and carriage  of firearms during  and\n            in  relation to  crimes  of violence,  in\n            violation of 18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1), with\n\n                    \n\n              dismissed by the court;\n\n          (5) the armed robbery  on August 3, 1991,\n              of the home of James Fitzpatrick, the\n              owner of a  chain of stores known  as\n              Lighthouse Markets, Inc., in Hampton,\n              New Hampshire;\n\n          (6) the armed robbery on August 17, 1991,\n              of  the  person of  James Fitzpatrick\n              after  he  made his  night  rounds to\n              collect  receipts  at  each   of  his\n              stores; and\n\n          (7) the armed  robbery of the  First N.H.\n              in   Stratham,   New   Hampshire   on\n              September 9, 1991.\n\n                               -5-\n\n            each  count corresponding  to one  of the\n            seven robberies.  Flynn was named  in all\n            counts and Kenney was named in all counts\n            except Count 20;\n\n            Counts  19  and  26  through  29  charged\n                                            \n            possession  of a  firearm by  a convicted\n            felon,   in   violation   of  18   U.S.C.\n              922(g).   Flynn was named  in Count  19\n            only; Kenney was named in Count 26 only;\n\n            Count 30  charged  Appellant Neal  as  an\n                    \n            accessory after the fact, in violation of\n            18 U.S.C.   3;\n\n            Count 31 charged money laundering against\n                    \n            Appellants Neal and  Flynn, in  violation\n            of  18 U.S.C.    1956 and 18  U.S.C.   2;\n            and\n\n            Count 32 charged criminal forfeiture of a\n                    \n            1987 Nissan automobile  against Neal  and\n            Flynn, in  violation of 18  U.S.C.    981\n            and 1956.\n\nGovernment's Consolidated Brief at 3-6.\n\n          Appellants were initially charged with three  other co-\n\nconspirators, Bruce Raineri, Brian Raineri, and Richard Ferguson.\n\nThese three  men pled guilty  and cooperated  to varying  extents\n\nwith  the  Government.   Several  other  alleged co-conspirators,\n\nincluding  Arthur  Cosgro  and Thomas  McQueeney,  also  provided\n\nevidence against Appellants.    \n\n          The  evidence presented during the thirty-one-day trial\n\nis  sufficient  to justify  the  following  conclusions of  fact.\n\nAppellant  Charles Flynn,  a/k/a  \"Chuckie,\" was  the leader  and\n\norganizer of  the group  of  co-conspirators.   Flynn scoped  out\n\nrobbery  locations, devised  the plans,  and recruited  others to\n\ncommit  or  assist  in  the  crimes.    Appellant William  Kenney\n\nparticipated  as  the gunman  and  shared  in  proceeds  of  four\n\n                               -6-\n\nrobberies planned by Flynn,  excluding the Market Basket robbery.\n\nKenney also assisted Flynn in \n\n                               -7-\n\nsurveilling armored  cars that serviced various  stores and banks\n\nwhich were prospective robbery sites.  Appellant Gary Neal played\n\na  more limited role in the overall conspiracy (this is reflected\n\nby the  fact that he was  indicted on only four  counts and found\n\nguilty  on two  counts  limited  to  the  bank  robbery).2    The\n\nevidence demonstrated  that Neal  provided his  home  to the  co-\n\nconspirators where they planned the bank  robbery and took refuge\n\nafter  they  committed  the  crime.   Immediately  following  the\n\nrobbery, Neal carried  a box from  the getaway car into  his home\n\ncontaining the gun used in the bank robbery along with the stolen\n\nproceeds.  He also  used proceeds from the robbery to  purchase a\n\ncar  in his name that was  used by Flynn and  Kenney to travel to\n\nArizona and then to  California in order to  escape the scene  of\n\nthe crime.  On their  trip, Flynn and Kenney disposed of  clothes\n\nused in the crime and stored the gun used in all five crimes in a\n\ngarage  belonging  to   Patricia  Ferguson,  a   co-conspirator's\n\nrelative.\n\n          On defendants'  motions at  the close of  the evidence,\n\nthe court dismissed RICO  Counts 1 and 2, finding  the Government\n\nfailed to demonstrate  a sufficient continuity of  offenses.  The\n\ncourt also dismissed  Counts 12,  13, and 23,  all involving  the\n\nPhantom Fireworks robbery.   The jury then rendered its verdicts,\n\nfinding Flynn guilty on all remaining charges  against him except\n                                                                 \n\nCounts 8, 9, and  21, involving the night  deposit robbery of  an\n\n                    \n\n2  The  four counts  include conspiracy to  commit bank  robbery,\naccessory after the  fact to bank robbery, money  laundering, and\ncriminal forfeiture.  \n\n                               -8-\n\nemployee  of Abercrombie  and Finch restaurant.   The  jury found\n\nKenney  guilty on all remaining counts against him except for the\n                                                         \n\ncounts involving the Abercrombie and Finch robbery and found Neal\n\nguilty of being an accessory after the fact and money laundering,\n\nas  alleged  in Counts  30 and  31, but  not  guilty on  count 3,\n\nalleging conspiracy to rob First N.H.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellants raise a litany of challenges against various\n\nrulings issued by the district court judge and statements made by\n\nthe Government throughout the proceedings.  The Court finds merit\n\nin Appellant  Flynn's argument that  both the Government  and the\n\ndistrict judge were operating under an improper legal standard in\n\ndetermining what statements qualified  as Jencks Act material and\n\nshould  have been  disclosed to  the defense  during trial.   The\n\nCourt also  finds merit  in Appellant  Neal's  argument that  the\n\ncourt erred in ordering  $266,500 in restitution against  him for\n\nhis role  in the First  N.H. robbery.   These  arguments will  be\n\ntreated first.  The Court finds no merit in Appellants' remaining\n\nclaims which  will be discussed, in  turn, in the order  of joint\n\nchallenges raised  by Appellants  followed  by challenges  raised\n\nindividually by Flynn, Kenney, and Neal.\n\n                  I.  LEGAL STANDARD USED BY THE\n                                                \n             COURT AND GOVERNMENT IN DETERMINING WHAT\n                                                     \n         EVIDENCE SHOULD BE DISCLOSED TO APPELLANT FLYNN\n                                                        \n\n                         A.  Brady Claims\n                                         \n\n          Appellant  Flynn has  framed  much of  his argument  on\n\nappeal in  terms of a  Brady violation.   Brady v. Maryland,  373\n                                                           \n\n                               -9-\n\nU.S.  83  (1963)(holding  that   a  prosecutor's  suppression  of\n\nevidence favorable to  and requested by a  defendant violates due\n\nprocess  where   the  evidence  is   material  to  guilt   or  to\n\npunishment).    Appellant  points  to statements  in  the  record\n\nindicating that  the Government attorney  harbored an erroneously\n\nnarrow view  of what materials  were exculpatory and  should have\n\nbeen  disclosed to the defense pursuant to Brady and its progeny.\n                                                \n\nFlynn acknowledges that the  Government provided certain disputed\n\nmaterials to  the trial court for in  camera review.  However, he\n                                            \n\nargues that the Government's erroneous view of what qualified  as\n\nBrady,  as  a  threshold  matter, most  likely  resulted  in  the\n     \n\nwithholding of  many other exculpatory materials  from the court.\n\nHe requests this Court  to unseal the documents that  were turned\n\nover,  remand the case for further hearing in the district court,\n\nand order that the  Government disclose all other Brady  material\n                                                       \n\nin its possession. \n\n          A careful  and thorough  review of the  record supports\n\nAppellant's assertion that  the Government attorney misunderstood\n\nthe reach of  Brady.3   However, in virtually  every instance  of\n                   \n\n                    \n\n3  In one  example of this misunderstanding,  Appellant's counsel\ninquired  whether  any Brady  material  existed  with respect  to\nRichard  Ferguson,  a  co-conspirator  who  cooperated  with  the\nGovernment.  The Government attorney replied:\n\n            First  of all,  it's not  Brady material.\n            If   it's   anything,  it's   impeachment\n            material, if it is even that.  \n\nTr.   (October 19,  1992)  at 115.   In  a  second incident,  the\nGovernment attorney stated that:\n\n            Prior  inconsistent  statements  are  not\n\n                               -10-\n\ndispute  pointed  out  by   Appellant  and  the  Government,  the\n\nGovernment attorney  indicated on  the record that  all materials\n                                                       \n\nrelated to the witness in question were being  turned over to the\n\ndistrict judge  for review.4   Appellant  makes no argument  that\n\n                    \n\n            Brady.   I'll be  happy at some  point to\n            give   Mr.  Wilson   a   lesson  in   the\n            difference between  Brady and impeachment\n            material, but there  is a difference  all\n            the  way up to  the United States Supreme\n            Court.\n\nTr.  (October 20, 1992) at 77.\n\n   These   statements   reflect   a   misunderstanding   on   the\nGovernment's  part  of the  Brady rule.    The Supreme  Court has\n                                 \nclearly  stated that  impeachment  evidence may  well qualify  as\nBrady  material.   United  States v.  Bagley,  473 U.S.  667, 676\n                                            \n(1985); Giglio v. United  States, 405 U.S.  150, 154 (1972).   As\n                                \nthe Court explained in Giglio:\n                             \n\n            When the 'reliability  of a given witness\n            may well  be  determinative of  guilt  or\n            innocence,'  nondisclosure  of   evidence\n            affecting credibility  falls within th[e]\n            general rule [of Brady].\n\nGiglio, 405 U.S. at 154.\n      \n\n   The significance of the Government's failure to appreciate the\nnature of exculpatory evidence under Brady is demonstrated by its\nevaluation of materials related to the witness James Fitzpatrick,\nwho was  testifying about a robbery  of his home.   Tr.  (October\n28, 1992) at 115.  The court reviewed  these materials, which the\nGovernment had  claimed did not  fall under Brady,  and disclosed\nthem to the defense because it found that the materials contained\nexculpatory evidence.  Id. at 121.  The defense  was  able to use\n                          \nthe  materials  quite  effectively  in  the cross-examination  of\nFitzpatrick.  Id. at 123-24 and 126-44.\n                 \n\n4  All materials  were supplied for the court's  review regarding\nBrady or  Jencks Act  requests  with respect  to witnesses  Laura\n     \nMacPherson, Tr.

The  Act further  requires the\n\ndefendant  to make a motion for production.  18 U.S.C.   3500(b).\n\nSubsection  (e)  defines  \"statements\"  subject  to  the  Act  as\n\nfollows:\n\n          (1)  a  written  statement made  by said\n               witness  and  signed  or  otherwise\n               adopted or approved by him;\n          (2)  a     stenographic,     mechanical,\n               electrical, or  other recording, or\n               a transcription thereof, which is a\n               substantially  verbatim recital  of\n               an  oral  statement  made  by  said\n               witness         and        recorded\n               contemporaneously  with the  making\n               of such oral statement; or\n          (3)  a   statement,  however   taken  or\n               recorded,   or    a   transcription\n               thereof,  if  any,  made   by  said\n               witness to a grand jury.       \n\n18 U.S.C.   3500(e).  \n\n          At issue  in  this case  is  the reach  of  subsections\n\n(e)(1) and  (e)(2) which first came into dispute on the third day\n\nof trial.   18  U.S.C.     3500 (e)(1) and  (e)(2).   Appellant's\n\ncounsel was conducting  cross-examination of Laura  MacPherson, a\n\nteller  for  First  N.H.  who  had  witnessed  the bank  robbery.\n\nMacPherson  testified  that while  she  was  being questioned  by\n\npolice  at the scene  of the crime,  an officer was  taking notes\n\nbased  on what she was  saying.  Appellant's  counsel then called\n\nfor  a  sidebar requesting  that the  Government turn  over these\n\nnotes pursuant to the Jencks Act:\n\n                               -13-\n\n            Court:   It  isn't [Jencks]  unless she's\n            seen it and adopted it.  \n\n            Counsel:   But if  18  3500 controls  [18\n            U.S.C.   3500], as I read it, a statement\n            that  is  taken  down  by   anybody,  she\n            doesn't  have to  adopt  it.   If it's  a\n            written statement taken  down by a person\n            dealing  with  the   subject  matter   in\n            question,  I'm entitled  to  it.   And  I\n            refer to 18 3500(e)(2).    \n\n            Government:      As   I  understand   the\n            application  of  the  cited   rule  under\n            Jencks,  what  counsel  is  referring  to\n            under (e)(2) is a mechanical recording or\n            a  transcription of  a recording  of some\n            kind,  either  stenographic,  mechanical,\n            electrical,   or   other   recording   or\n            transcription of that recording; that is,\n            a transcript.  There is no  such material\n            as  the statement is defined under Jencks\n            as I read the statute in that rule.    \n\n            Court:   That was my understanding of the\n            interpretation of the  statute, sir,  and\n            there  are  none  of  those  stenographic\n            recordings [or] transcriptions.  \n\nTr. (October 8, 1992) at 118, 121-22.\n\n          While   the   Government   attorney  mentioned   \"other\n\nrecording,\"  it is clear from a reading of the entire interchange\n\nthat the  court and Government attorney  disagreed with counsel's\n\nargument  that subsection  (e)(2) of  the Jencks  Act encompasses\n\noral  statements  made  by witnesses  that  are  written down  by\n\ngovernment agents as  they are taking notes on  the conversation,\n\nso long  as such statements are  substantially verbatim accounts.\n\nFurther, the trial record is replete with statements by the court\n\nindicating  that  it  viewed  subsections (e)(1)  and  (e)(2)  as\n\nlimited to statements  that are  either adopted by  a witness  or\n\n                               -14-\n\nrecorded through stenographic or some kind of mechanical means.5\n\n          This legal basis, cited  as the ground for many  of the\n\ncourt's Jencks Act rulings, is erroneous.  Since 1959, the United\n\nStates  Supreme Court has held  that the phrase \"other recording\"\n\nin subsection  (e)(2)  \"was meant  to  encompass more  than  mere\n\nautomatic reproductions  of oral statements.\"   Palermo v. United\n                                                                 \n\nStates,  360  U.S.  343,  352  (1959);  18  U.S.C.    3500(e)(2).\n      \n\nFollowing  the Supreme Court's  lead, this Court  has stated that\n\n\"[a] longhand writing  which the court found  fairly followed the\n\nwitness' words, subject  to minor, inconsequential errors\"  would\n\nfall within (e)(2).

It  is clear\n            from    the   continuous    congressional\n            emphasis   on   'substantially   verbatim\n            recital,'   and   'continuous,  narrative\n            statements, made by the  witness recorded\n            verbatim,  or  nearly so . . .'  that the\n            legislation was designed to eliminate the\n            danger       of      distortion       and\n            misrepresentation  inherent  in a  report\n            which  merely  selects  portions,  albeit\n            accurately, from a lengthy  oral recital.\n            Quoting out of context is one of the most\n            frequent    and    powerful   modes    of\n            misquotation.    We  think it  consistent\n            with this legislative  history, and  with\n            the  generally  restrictive terms  of the\n            statutory  provision,   to  require  that\n            summaries  of  an  oral  statement  which\n            evidence    substantial    selection   of\n            material,  or  which were  prepared after\n            the interview without the aid of complete\n            notes,  and hence  rest on the  memory of\n            the  agent,  are   not  to  be  produced.\n            Neither, of course, are  statements which\n            contain  the  agent's interpretations  or\n            impressions.\n\nPalermo, 360 U.S. at 352-53.\n       \n\n                               -16-\n\n          In United  States v.

We rejected the argument on\n\ntwo grounds: first because  Appellant failed to make a  motion on\n\nthe  basis of  that subsection  to the  court below  and, second,\n\nthere was no testimony in the  record to indicate that \"the agent\n\n[had been] recording  the exact words  of the witness.\"   Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n954.   In this case, however, Appellant's counsel elicited from a\n\nnumber  of witnesses  that agents  had been  taking notes  as the\n\nwitnesses   were   making   statements;  at   sidebars,   counsel\n\nspecifically  cited  (e)(2) as  the  basis  for  his  Jencks  Act\n\nmotions; and he registered, on the record,  his disagreement with\n\nthe court's and the Government's interpretation of the statute.\n\n          Appellant clearly raised this  issue to the court below\n\nand on  appeal.  After  examining the  record, we  find that  the\n\ndistrict  judge  likely ruled  against  a  number of  Appellant's\n\nJencks Act requests on  an erroneous legal ground.7   Rather than\n\n                    \n\n7   In all honesty, this Court has not always been as clear as it\nshould  have been  in  pointing out  the distinctions  between 18\nU.S.C.    3500 (e)(1) and (e)(2).  In United States v. Sep lveda,\n                                                                \n15 F.3d 1161, 1179 (1st Cir. 1993),  this Court indicated that to\nbe  discoverable  under  the  Jencks Act,  a  statement  must  be\n\"substantially  a  verbatim  account\" and  \"signed  or  otherwise\n                                         \nverified  by the  witness himself.\"   The statements  in question\nsatisfied neither requirement.  It is clear from a reading of the\nauthorities  cited  in  Sep lveda,   however,  that  this   Court\n                                 \ninterprets  the Jencks Act as requiring either a showing that the\n                                              \nstatement  is a  substantially  verbatim account  or that  it was\n                                                    \nadopted  by the witness.

He\n\nargues  that the district  court erred,  as a  matter of  law, by\n\nordering  him to pay full restitution of First N.H.'s losses from\n\nthe  robbery when those losses were not fully attributable to his\n\noffenses  of  being  an  accessory   after  the  fact  and  money\n\nlaundering.   We review this claim  of legal error de  novo.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v.

In an order  dated February 22,  1993, the district\n\n                    \n\n9   18  U.S.C.    3664(a)  directs  the  court  to  consider  the\nfollowing factors:\n\n             . . . the amount  of the loss  sustained\n            by any victim as a result of the offense,\n            the financial resources of the defendant,\n            the financial needs  and earning  ability\n            of  the  defendant  and  the  defendant's\n            dependents, and such other factors as the\n            court deems appropriate.\n\n                               -20-\n\ncourt summarily  dismissed Neal's argument that he  should not be\n\nrequired  to  make restitution  in  an  amount greater  than  the\n\nproceeds that  he personally obtained  from the  robbery.   Order\n\n(Docket No. 302) at 3-4.  While the court was correct in its view\n\nthat  the  VWPA  does  not require  restitutionary  awards  to be\n\nlimited to the amount obtained by the defendant, the record gives\n\nno  indication  of  whether  the court  calculated,  pursuant  to\n\nHughey, the  portion of  First N.H.'s losses  that were  actually\n                                                                 \n\ncaused by  the specific  criminal conduct  forming the  basis for\n                                                                 \n\nNeal's convictions.  \n                  \n\n          The VWPA,  itself, does not  require the court  to make\n\nexplicit findings  to justify restitutionary awards.   This Court\n\nhas held \"that a district judge need not make open-court findings\n\non the statutory factors when issuing a restitution order so long\n\nas  the record  on appeal  reveals that  the judge  made implicit\n\nfindings  or otherwise  adequately evinced  his consideration  of\n\nthose  factors.\"   Savoie,  985 F.2d  at  618.   The record  here\n                         \n\nindicates that the court  ordered the same restitutionary amounts\n\nof $266,500  against Appellants  Neal,  Kenney, and  Flynn.   The\n\nrecord also indicates  that in connection with  the bank robbery,\n\nKenney  and Flynn were convicted of conspiracy to rob First N.H.,\n\nconspiracy and interference with  commerce by threats or violence\n\nin  violation of the  Hobbs Act, and  the use of  firearms during\n\ncrimes  of violence.  Kenney was also convicted for possession of\n\na  firearm by a convicted  felon in committing  the bank robbery,\n\nand  Flynn was convicted of money laundering.  In comparison with\n\n                               -21-\n\nFlynn  and Kenney, Neal was convicted of being an accessory after\n\nthe fact  and money laundering.   Given these  factors indicating\n\nthe  disparate nature of Neal's criminal conduct, there is not an\n\nadequate basis in  the record to  determine whether the  district\n\njudge found that the full amount of losses suffered by First N.H.\n                                                                 \n\nwas  \"caused by  the specific  conduct that  [was] the  basis of\"\n\nNeal's convictions.  Hughey, 495 U.S. at 413.\n                           \n\n          Such  a determination  was required  in this  case even\n\nthough Congress amended certain provisions of the VWPA soon after\n\nthe Hughey  decision as  part of the  Crime Control Act  of 1990.\n          \n\nSee Pub. L.  No. 101-647,    2509, 104  Stat. 4789, 4863  (1990).\n   \n\nOne of  the amended subsections,  codified at  18 U.S.C.  section\n\n3663(a)(2), expanded  the definition of \"victim\"  for purposes of\n\nrestitution, providing in pertinent part that: \n\n            a victim  of an offense that  involves as\n                                                     \n            an element  a scheme, a  conspiracy, or a\n                      \n            pattern  of  criminal activity  means any\n            person directly harmed by the defendant's\n            criminal conduct  in  the course  of  the\n            scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\n\n18 U.S.C. section 3663(a)(2)(emphasis added).  This broadening of\n\nthe definition  of \"victim\" appears  to apply to  cases involving\n\nmail fraud,  racketeering, or  other federal crimes  that require\n\nproof  of a scheme,  conspiracy, or pattern  of criminal conduct.\n\nThis Court faced such a case in U.S. v. Cronin, 990 F.2d 663 (1st\n                                              \n\nCir. 1993)  and  decided  that  where  defendants  had  committed\n\nvarious  mail  fraud  offenses  prior  to  enactment  of  section\n                                         \n\n3663(a)(2), restitution should be  limited to the amounts alleged\n\nin the specific counts  on which each defendant was  found guilty\n\n                               -22-\n\nand not awarded  for the full amount of  losses stemming from the\n\nmail fraud scheme of which each defendant was a part.  \n\n          While  the bank  robbery alleged  in the  indictment in\n\nthis  case occurred  subsequent to  the VWPA  amendments, section\n                                  \n\n3663(a)(2) does  not appear  to support the  restitutionary award\n\nentered against  Appellant Neal.   Neal  was  convicted of  money\n\nlaundering and  of being an accessory after the fact.  Neither of\n\nthese  offenses involves proof of a scheme, conspiracy or pattern\n\nof criminal  activity as an element.   See 18 U.S.C. section 1956\n                                          \n\n(laundering  of monetary  instruments)  and 18  U.S.C. section  3\n\n(accessory after the fact).    \n\n          Accordingly, we remand the case with instructions  that\n\nthe court hold a  hearing to determine whether the full amount of\n\ndamages  suffered by First  N.H. are attributable  to the conduct\n\nunderlying Appellant's  convictions.10   We leave  the dimensions\n\nof  the hearing,  as well  as the  necessity vel  non for  taking\n                                                     \n\nadditional  evidence, in  the  sound discretion  of the  district\n\ncourt.   Similar  to  the limited  remand  that we  ordered  with\n\nrespect to Appellant Flynn's Jencks Act challenge, see pp.  16-17\n                                                      \n\n                    \n\n10  We do not mean to suggest that on remand there is no possible\nbasis  for holding Neal accountable for the full amount of losses\nsuffered by First N.H.   We are only suggesting that  the record,\nas  it  stands,   does  not  indicate  whether,   and  upon  what\nevidentiary  basis,  the trial  judge  determined  that the  full\namount of losses are attributable to Neal's criminal conduct.  If\non  remand, for  example, evidence  is presented  indicating that\nNeal played  a significant role  in helping the  other defendants\nescape  and that  but for  his actions,  there was  a substantial\nlikelihood that the full proceeds would have been  recovered, the\ncourt  could well be  within its statutory  authority in imposing\nthe full $266,500 in restitution.\n\n                               -23-\n\nsupra, we will retain appellate jurisdiction and order the  court\n     \n\nto  report its findings  to us within  ninety (90) days.   If the\n\ncourt determines  that the full  amount of  First N.H.'s  damages\n\nwere caused by Appellant's criminal conduct, it should supplement\n\nthe record with these findings.   If the court concludes that the\n\nfull restitutionary  award is not supported by facts presented at\n\nthe evidentiary hearing, it  should vacate the award and  enter a\n\nnew  restitutionary  order based  upon  a  determination of  that\n\namount of damages suffered by First N.H. which is attributable to\n\nthe conduct underlying Appellant's convictions.\n\n                      III.

This Court is satisfied that the instructions\n\nrendered in this  case fully satisfy  constitutional requirements\n\nand   comply  with   Olmstead.12     The  judge   reiterated  the\n                             \n\n                    \n\n12   In addition  to the instructions listed  in n.11, supra, the\n                                                            \ncourt further instructed the jury as follows:\n\n            Moreover,  the law  never imposes  upon a\n            defendant   the   burden   or   duty   of\n            testifying or producing any  evidence, so\n            a  reasonable  doubt may  arise  not only\n            from the evidence  produced but also from\n            a lack of evidence.   The government must\n            prove  beyond  a reasonable  doubt  as to\n            each defendant every essential element of\n            the offense with which that  defendant is\n            charged.  Each defendant has the right to\n            rely upon the  failure of the prosecution\n            to   establish   such  proof,   and  each\n            defendant  may  also  rely upon  evidence\n            brought   out  on   cross-examination  of\n            witnesses presented by the prosecution.\n\nThe court then concluded its instructions as follows:\n\n            To  sum up  then,  you should  treat each\n            charge   made   with   respect  to   each\n            defendant separately and give to  each of\n            such   charges   the  same   careful  and\n            thorough consideration you would  wish to\n            have  given  to  each  of  you  were  you\n            charged  with the  offenses set  forth in\n            this indictment.  As I have indicated  to\n            you, the burden in each instance which is\n            placed  upon the  government is  to prove\n            each element  of the offenses  with which\n            each  defendant  is   charged  beyond   a\n            reasonable  doubt, and  in the  event the\n            government fails to sustain its burden of\n            proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to any\n            essential element of any  offense charged\n\n                               -25-\n\ngovernment's burden of  proof a number  of times; explained  that\n\nthe  government must  satisfy this  burden with  respect to  each\n\nelement  of the offense with which each defendant is charged; and\n\ntold  the   jurors  to  consider  the   evidence  separately  and\n\nimpartially  against each defendant.

When read\n                                                     \n\nin context, the phrase  \"by medium of admissible evidence\"  would\n\nbe  interpreted by a reasonable juror to mean that the government\n\nmust satisfy its burden of proof through admissible evidence.13\n                                        \n\n                    \n\n            against each defendant, it has  failed in\n            its burden of proof as  to each defendant\n            and    that    defendant    is   to    be\n            acquitted. . . .  So,  if any  reasonable\n            doubt  remains in  your minds  as to  the\n            guilt  of  any defendant  after impartial\n            consideration of all of the evidence with\n            respect  to  such defendant,  it  is your\n            duty to  find that defendant  not guilty.\n            You  should analyze what  the evidence in\n            the  case  shows  with  respect  to  each\n            element of each  offense charged  against\n            each defendant and determine the issue as\n            to whether the  government has  sustained\n            its  burden of proof with respect to each\n            such element.  \n\n13    The  first  definition   of  \"medium\"  found  in  Webster's\ndictionary is  \"something  in a  middle  position\" or  \"a  middle\ncondition  or  degree.\"   The second  definition  is \"a  means of\neffecting  or   conveying  something.\"     Webster's   Ninth  New\n                                                                 \nCollegiate Dictionary (1987).\n                     \n\n   Appellants  argue that  the  trial  court's  instructions  led\njurors to  interpret  \"medium\"  along  the  lines  of  the  first\ndefinition.   We note that  during the Rule  30 sidebar regarding\nobjections to  the instructions, Appellants did  not request that\nthe district court clarify  the sense in  which it used the  word\n\"medium.\"  In  addition, we  find that a  reasonable juror  would\nhave  interpreted  \"medium\"   in  accordance   with  the   second\ndefinition where  the judge used  \"beyond a reasonable  doubt\" in\nthe  same  sentence  and  made  clear that  the  latter  standard\nrepresented the Government's burden of proof:\n\n            this  presumption  of  innocence  can  be\n\n                               -26-\n\n          Appellants ask  the Court to reconsider  its holding in\n\nOlmstead  in  light  of  recent Supreme  Court  decisions.    The\n        \n\nopinions  cited  by Appellants,  however,  do  nothing more  than\n\nprovide support  for Olmstead.   The  cases all involve  judicial\n                             \n\nattempts to  define reasonable doubt and  recognize that attempts\n\nto  imbue  the  phrase with  exact  definition  are  fraught with\n\npitfalls.    See,  e.g., Victor  v.  Nebraska,  114  S. Ct.  1239\n                                             \n\n(1994)(holding  that instructions,  taken as  a whole,  correctly\n\nconveyed  the concept of reasonable doubt despite the use of such\n\nterms as  \"moral evidence\", \"moral certainty,\"   and \"substantial\n\ndoubt\"); Sullivan  v. Louisiana,  113 S. Ct.  2078 (1993)(holding\n                               \n\nthat a constitutionally deficient instruction defining reasonable\n\ndoubt  cannot be harmless error); Cage v.

Ct.  at 1248,  Justice\n                                \n\nO'Connor noted that  the court did  not condone the  use of  such\n\nterms as \"moral certainty\" in defining reasonable doubt  but went\n\non to find  that the instructions placed  the terms in a  context\n\n                    \n\n            overcome  only  when  the government,  by\n            medium of  admissible evidence, satisfies\n            its  burden  of  convincing   the  jurors\n            beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of\n            each defendant as to every element of the\n            offense  with  which  that defendant  has\n            been charged.   \n\n                               -27-\n\ncorrectly conveying the quantum of proof necessary for a  finding\n\nof guilt.  She also noted that:\n\n            [T]he   Constitution  neither   prohibits\n            trial  courts  from  defining  reasonable\n            doubt  nor requires  them to  do so  as a\n            matter  of   course  (citation  omitted).\n            Indeed,  so long  as the  court instructs\n            the   jury  on  the  necessity  that  the\n            defendant's  guilt  be  proven  beyond  a\n            reasonable doubt, (citation omitted), the\n            Constitution  does  not require  that any\n            particular  form  of  words  be  used  in\n            advising  the  jury  of the  government's\n            burden of proof (citation omitted).\n\nVictor, 114 S. Ct. at 1243.\n      \n\n          Because we find that nothing in the Supreme Court cases\n\ncited  by  Appellants brings  into  question the  holding  in the\n\nOlmstead case, we affirm the district court's instructions.\n        \n\n      B.  Sufficiency of Evidence Supporting Guilty Verdicts\n                                                            \n  of Flynn and Kenney on Counts Involving the Dress Barn Robbery\n                                                                \n\n          Appellants Flynn  and Kenney challenge  the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence  supporting their guilty  verdicts on Counts  10,\n\n11, and 22, involving the robbery of a Dress  Barn employee while\n\nshe attempted to  deposit about  $763 into a  night deposit  box.\n\nCounts  10 and  11 alleged  that Flynn  and Kenney  conspired and\n\ninterfered with commerce by threats or violence in committing the\n\nDress  Barn  robbery in  violation of  the  Hobbs Act,  18 U.S.C.\n\n  1951.  Count  22 involved  the use  and carriage  of a  firearm\n\nduring and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.   924(c)(1).\n\n          In reviewing a  sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim,  the\n\nCourt  must view  the facts  in the light  most favorable  to the\n\n                               -28-\n\nGovernment, deferring  to the jury's verdict if  the evidence can\n\nsupport  varying  interpretations,  at  least  one  of  which  is\n\nconsistent with the defendant's guilt.  United States  v. Browne,\n                                                                \n\n891 F.2d  389, 393 (1st  Cir. 1989).  Viewed  in this light,  the\n\nevidence must  be of such  a quantum  that a reasonable  trier of\n\nfact  could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but the evidence\n           \n\nneed not compel such a finding.  Id.\n                                    \n\n          As  the basis  for  their  challenge, Appellants  point\n\nprimarily to inconsistencies  in identification testimony between\n\nthe bank  employee and co-conspirator Thomas McQueeny.   The bank\n\nemployee testified that the robber  was wearing a white styrofoam\n\nwoodworker's mask that stood  out from his  face and that he  was\n\nwearing a Patagonia jacket  and a pair of  jeans.  McQueeney,  on\n\nthe  other  hand,  indicated  that  Kenney  was wearing  a  white\n\npainter's mask made of cloth and a blue runner's suit.14\n\n          Viewed in  the light most favorable  to the Government,\n\nthe identification testimony supports the  jury's guilty verdict.\n\n                    \n\n14   The remaining evidence consisted of  additional testimony by\nMcQueeny  who stated that  he and Flynn  watched Kenney  try on a\nwhite  cloth painter's  mask  and that,  at  Flynn's request,  he\ndropped Kenney off near  First National Bank on the  night of the\nrobbery carrying a  bag with the mask,  the gun, and  the gloves.\nHe also testified about an argument the next morning during which\nFlynn  scolded  Kenney for  robbing women  with  only $600.   The\nemployee was unable to identify Kenney but was able to testify to\nhis  approximate  height and  age.   She  also testified  that he\ncarried a  handgun similar to the semi-automatic  admitted by the\nGovernment as Exhibit 42 and that the stolen proceeds belonged to\na business involved in interstate commerce.  Co-conspirator Brian\nRaineri testified, indicating that  he had discussions with Flynn\non  how to  rob  night depositories,  and co-conspirator  Richard\nFerguson testified that Kenney later admitted to robbing a couple\nof night depositories.\n\n                               -29-\n\nMcQueeney  indicated  that he  dropped  Kenney off  with  a white\n\npainter's  mask and  a gun  near the  scene of  the  robbery; the\n\nemployee  testified  that  her  assailant  was  wearing  a  white\n\ncarpenter's mask and carrying a gun similar to Government Exhibit\n\n42.   McQueeney also supplied evidence  of conspiracy, testifying\n\nthat  Flynn  watched  as  Kenney  tried  on  the  mask,  directed\n\nMcQueeney to drop Kenney off near First National Bank, and argued\n\nwith Kenney the  following morning for targeting women  with only\n\n$600.  Kenney  later admitted to co-conspirator  Ferguson that he\n\nrobbed  some  night depositories.    While the  evidence  may not\n\ncompel  guilty verdicts,  this  Court  finds  that  it  is  of  a\n      \n\nsufficient quantum  that a reasonable  trier of  fact could  find\n                  \n\nAppellants  guilty  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  on  the  counts\n\ninvolving the  Dress  Barn robbery.    Hence, the  Court  affirms\n\nFlynn's and Kenney's convictions on Counts 10, 11, and 22.  \n\n         C.

P. 14 provides in relevant part:\n\n            If  it  appears that  a defendant  or the\n            government is prejudiced by a  joinder of\n            offenses   or   of   defendants   in   an\n            indictment  or  information  or  by  such\n            joinder for trial together, the court may\n            order an election  of separate trials  of\n\n                               -30-\n\nproper but  became prejudicial when the  district court dismissed\n\nthe RICO counts at the close of the Government's case for failure\n\nto  establish a pattern of racketeering  activity.  Assuming that\n\ninitial joinder was  proper under  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 8(b),16  the\n\ndistrict  court has  considerable  latitude in  treating  motions\n\nbased on prejudicial joinder  under Rule 14, and \"its  resolution\n\nof  severance  questions will  be  overturned only  if  that wide\n\ndiscretion is  plainly abused.\"   United States  v.

Id;  Natanel, 938 F.2d at 308 (citing United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Porter, 764  F.2d 1,  12 (1st Cir. 1985)).   Appellants  argue\n         \n\nthat prejudice  resulted because the jury was  exposed to certain\n\nevidence that would otherwise have been inadmissible against them\n\nwithout the RICO counts.  They specifically point to testimony by\n\nofficials  of the New Hampshire State Police who observed them on\n\nnumerous occasions  surveilling armored trucks in preparation for\n\nthe  First N.H.  robbery.   Appellants argue that  this testimony\n\nwould not have been admitted but for the RICO counts  and that it\n\nprejudiced the  jury in considering the  remaining counts against\n\nthem.  The admissibility  of the surveillance testimony, however,\n\nwas not limited to the RICO  counts, as Appellants argue, but was\n\nrelevant  to  Counts 3,  4,  5, 16,  17,  18,  and 19,  involving\n\nconspiracy to commit bank robbery and other bank robbery charges.\n\nAppellants also  give no clear indication,  other than conclusory\n\nstatements, of  how this  surveillance testimony was  so material\n\nand  significant as to make a prejudicial finding likely on other\n\nunrelated counts. \n\n          Appellants  make a  more general  \"spillover\" argument,\n\n                               -32-\n\nasserting that  evidence admitted at trial relating  to the whole\n\nseries  of robberies linked by the RICO counts made it impossible\n\nfor  the  jury  to  consider  each  defendant  and  each  offense\n\nseparately.  \"There is  always some prejudice in any  trial where\n\nmore than one offense or offender are tried together --  but such\n\n'garden variety'  prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice.\"\n\nUnited  States  v.

See  nn. 11 &amp; 12\n                                                    \n\nsupra.

The Court  also notes that\n                   \n\nevidence at trial was presented in a compartmentalized fashion to\n\nassist the jury in distinguishing  between the various crimes and\n\ndefendants;  i.e., the  first fifteen days  of trial  covered the\n                 \n\nFirst  N.H. robbery  while successive  days treated  each of  the\n\nother predicate acts in turn.\n\n          Finding no  abuse of discretion, the  Court affirms the\n\n                    \n\n17  The  jury found Appellants not guilty on Counts  8, 9 and 21,\ninvolving the night deposit robbery of a restaurant employee, but\nguilty on counts involving the five remaining robberies.

Machor,\n                                                                \n\n879 F.2d 945, 952  (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493  U.S. 1081,\n                                                \n\n1094 (1990).\n\n          The  record indicates  that Flynn first  requested, and\n\nwas granted, the right to seek retained counsel  on May 28, 1992,\n\nafter  withdrawing his motion to represent himself pro se.  Flynn\n                                                         \n\nfailed to  retain counsel in  the time  allotted and on  June 18,\n\nappeared  before  a   magistrate  judge  in  a  hearing   on  the\n\nGovernment's motion  to have  counsel appointed  for him.   Flynn\n\ntold  the magistrate  that  he  still  desired to  seek  retained\n\ncounsel and mentioned  the names  of two possible  lawyers.   The\n\nmagistrate  granted the  Government's  motion  and  appointed  as\n\nFlynn's  counsel  Attorney  Lawrence   Gillis,  who  entered  his\n\nappearance on July 6, 1992.   This action by the court in no  way\n\ninterfered  with  Flynn's  continued  efforts to  retain  outside\n\ncounsel.\n\n          On  September  1,  1992,  the  district  court  granted\n\n                               -34-\n\nFlynn's motion for continuance of trial, giving him one deadline,\n\nwhich lapsed, and extending it again until September 18 to enable\n\nFlynn  to  retain  private  counsel.18    Five  days   after  the\n\ndeadline,  on September 23, Attorney  Barry Wilson filed a motion\n\nto  enter his appearance as Flynn's counsel and, on September 25,\n\nfiled a motion to  continue the October trial date  until January\n\nof 1993, to  give him time  to prepare for  trial.  The  district\n\ncourt denied the  September 25 motion as well as  a motion, filed\n\non  the first  day of  trial, to  reconsider its  ruling, finding\n\nthat: \n\n            Flynn's maneuvers with respect to counsel\n            are such  as to  equate with a  waiver of\n            his  right  to choose  counsel. . . . The\n            court fully  understands the difficulties\n            imposed on Attorney Gillis by Mr. Flynn's\n            refusal  to date  to cooperate  with him,\n            but it behooves Mr. Flynn to now sit down\n            with  his appointed counsel and to assist\n            him in the presentation of his defenses. \n\nSeptember  28,  1992,  Order  (Docket  No. 187) at  3-4.    Trial\n\ncontinued as scheduled, beginning on October 5, 1992, except that\n                                                                 \n\nAttorney Gillis withdrew and Attorney Wilson took over as Flynn's\n\nretained counsel.\n\n          The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to\n\nassistance of  counsel, which includes  the right  to counsel  of\n\none's choice.   United States v.  Hallock, 941  F.2d 36, 44  (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1991).  While the right to effective assistance is absolute,\n\n                    \n\n18   Flynn's motion  was based  on an  affidavit filed  by Gillis\nalleging  a  total breakdown  in  communication  with his  client\nbecause  Flynn  refused to  cooperate  with  him  in preparing  a\ndefense.\n\n                               -35-\n\nthis  Court has long  held that a  defendant's right to  choose a\n\nparticular counsel  must  be weighed  against  administration-of-\n\njustice  concerns and \"cannot be  insisted upon in  a manner that\n\nwill obstruct  reasonable and  orderly court procedure.\"   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Poulack, 556 F.2d 83,  86 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 434\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 986  (1977); see also  Hallock, 941 F.2d at  44; Machor, 879\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  952; Tuitt  v.  Fair, 822  F.2d  166 (1st  Cir.),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 484 U.S. 945 (1987). \n      \n\n          In light  of these  factors, this  Court does  not find\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion in denying  Flynn's\n\nmotion for continuance.  In essence, Flynn had nearly four months\n\nto secure  private counsel -- from May 28,  1992, until September\n\n18,  1992.   The trial date  was continued  for one  month at his\n\nbehest;  yet he continually failed  to meet deadlines  set by the\n\ncourt.  Given these  circumstances, the Court affirms the  denial\n\nof Flynn's belated  September 25 motion  for continuance and  his\n\nlater motion to reconsider.19  \n\n           B.  The Court's Admission of Bank Employee's\n                                                       \n          Testimony and Its Denial of Appellant's Motion\n                                                        \n         for Judgment of Acquittal on Bank Robbery Counts\n                                                         \n\n          Appellant argues  that  the district  court  improperly\n\nadmitted  the  testimony of  bank  employee  Debbie Haskins,  who\n\ntestified with  respect to First N.H.'s  federally insured status\n\nand  its  involvement in  interstate  commerce.   Appellant  also\n\nchallenges the  sufficiency of  the evidence  in  support of  the\n\n                    \n\n19    The  Court notes  that  while  Flynn's  belated motion  for\ncontinuance  was  denied,  Attorney  Wilson  still  conducted his\nrepresentation at trial.\n\n                               -36-\n\njury's guilty verdicts on the bank robbery counts.\n\n          Appellant  first argues that  Haskins' testimony should\n\nnot  have been admitted because she  lacked personal knowledge of\n\nthe bank's FDIC  status or its involvement in interstate commerce\n\nas required  by Fed. R. Evid.  602 (witness may not  testify to a\n\nmatter without evidence that  she had \"personal knowledge of  the\n\nmatter\").   In  particular,  Appellant argues  that Haskins,  who\n\nworked  as an insurance compliance specialist for First N.H., did\n\nnot commence her employment  until a month after the  robbery, so\n\nher testimony was based on records that she was exposed to in the\n\ncourse of her later employment and not on knowledge formed at the\n\ntime of the robbery.\n\n          Evidence is inadmissible under Rule 602 \"only if in the\n\nproper exercise of the trial court's discretion it finds that the\n\nwitness could  not have actually perceived or observed that which\n\nhe testified to.\"  Hallquist v. Local 276, Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters\n                                                                 \n\nUnion, 843 F.2d 18,  24 (1st Cir. 1988).  Personal  knowledge can\n     \n\ninclude \"inferences and opinions, so long as they are grounded in\n\npersonal observation and experience.\"  United States v. Doe,  960\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  221, 223 (1st Cir. 1992).   Haskins testified  that her job\n\nbrought  her into  contact with  records,  including certificates\n\nprovided  by the  FDIC, which  indicated that  the  Stratham, New\n\nHampshire branch  of First  N.H. was federally  insured, although\n\nshe  had not  personally seen  such a  certificate posted  at the\n\nbranch on the date of the robbery.  She also  testified that bank\n\nrecords  to which she was  exposed indicated that  the branch had\n\n                               -37-\n\ncustomers  in  Vermont  and  Massachusetts  and  a  correspondent\n\nbanking  account in  Massachusetts.   This Court  finds that  the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Haskins'\n\ntestimony because it was limited to information that she actually\n\nperceived or  observed as an insurance  compliance specialist and\n\ndid   not   attest   to   circumstances   beyond   her   personal\n\nknowledge.20 \n\n          Appellant also  argues that the guilty  verdicts on the\n\nbank  robbery counts were not  supported by a  sufficiency of the\n\nevidence with respect  to the elements  of FDIC insurance  status\n\nand  involvement in  interstate  commerce.21   As the  Government\n\npoints out,  Appellant moved for  judgment of acquittal  on these\n\ncounts on the basis  of other arguments and  did not argue  below\n\nthat  dismissal should  be  granted on  the above-cited  grounds.\n\nConsequently, Appellant has waived this argument on appeal unless\n\nthe bank  robbery convictions  are \"clearly and  grossly unjust.\"\n\nUnited  States  v. L pez,  709 F.2d  742,  746 (1st  Cir.), cert.\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n20  Appellant's argument that  Haskins' knowledge was not  formed\non the basis of information that she possessed on the date of the\nrobbery  may have diminished the value of her testimony, but such\nan argument  does not  implicate  Rule 602.   \"'The  extent of  a\nwitness' knowledge of  matters about which  he offers to  testify\ngoes  to  the  weight  rather  than  the  admissibility   of  the\ntestimony.'\"   Hallquist,  843 F.2d  at  24 (quoting  Nielson  v.\n                                                                 \nArmstrong Rubber Co., 570 F.2d 272, 277 (8th Cir. 1978)).\n                    \n\n21   Proof  beyond a  reasonable doubt  that the  Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation insured  the deposits of  First N.H. is  an\nessential element of the  crimes alleged in Counts  3, 4, and  5,\nregarding the robbery  of First  N.H. in violation  of 18  U.S.C.\n  2113.   Proof beyond a  reasonable doubt that  robbery of First\nN.H.  had some  effect  on interstate  commerce  is an  essential\nelement of the Hobbs Act violations alleged in Counts 16, 17, and\n18.  18 U.S.C.   1951.\n\n                               -38-\n\ndenied, 464 U.S. 861 (1983).\n      \n\n          Even   under  the  less   rigorous  standard  governing\n\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence  claims,  however,   we  affirm   the\n\nconvictions.  The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nthe  Government, could have  persuaded a  rational trier  of fact\n\nbeyond a  reasonable doubt that  First N.H. was  FDIC-insured and\n\ninvolved in  interstate commerce.22  Hence,  the district court's\n\ndenial of Flynn's motion for acquittal on the bank robbery counts\n\nis affirmed.\n\n        C.  The Court's Denial of Motion to Sever Count 19\n                                                          \n        Charging Possession of Firearm by Convicted Felon\n                                                         \n\n          Appellant challenges the district court's denial of his\n\nmotion to  sever Count 19 as an abuse of discretion, arguing that\n\nthe  inclusion of  his  prior felony  history  resulted in  clear\n\nprejudice  and  denied him  a fair  trial.   Appellant  moved for\n\nseverance under Fed. R. Crim P. 14, which provides, in part, that\n\nif  it  appears  a defendant  may  be  prejudiced  by joinder  of\n\noffenses,  the court may \"order an election of separate trials of\n\ncounts, grant a severance of defendants or provide whatever other\n\n                    \n\n22  In addition to Haskins'  testimony, the Government introduced\ninto  evidence  a  certified copy  of  the  records  of the  FDIC\nestablishing  that  after  a  diligent  search  of  the  agency's\nrecords,  no evidence  was found  to indicate  that  First N.H.'s\ninsured  status was ever terminated on  or before the date of the\nSeptember  9,   1991,  robbery.    Further,   Haskins'  testimony\nregarding First  N.H.'s interstate accounts was  augmented by the\ntestimony of  another bank employee,  Anita Ramsdell, who  was in\ncharge  of   opening  new   accounts,  teller  supervision,   and\nmaintenance of the bank  vault.  According to Ramsdell,  the bank\nsold vault money to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and on the\nmorning of the  robbery, the  vault contained a  large amount  of\nmoney that was about to be shipped there.\n\n                               -39-\n\nrelief  justice  requires . . . . \"    Trial  courts are  granted\n\ndiscretion  under  Rule 14  to  take whatever  steps  are  deemed\n\nnecessary  to  minimize  prejudice;  \"[s]everance   is  only  one\n\nremedy -- and   certainly  the  most  extreme -- in  the  federal\n\ncourts'  remedial arsenal.\"   United States v.  Daniels, 770 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1111, 1120 (D.C. Cir. 1985).\n\n          Here  the record  indicates that  in ruling  on Flynn's\n\nmotion  on the first day  of trial, the  court declined severance\n\nbut  decided  not  to  disclose  the  details  of  Flynn's  prior\n\nconviction(s) in reading Count  19 to the jury.   Flynn's counsel\n\nlater indicated that  he would  stipulate to his  client being  a\n\nconvicted  felon and stipulate that the  court could instruct the\n\njury in that regard.  In its final instructions to  the jury, the\n\ncourt  indicated that the parties  had stipulated to  the fact of\n\nthe  prior conviction(s),  without  detailing the  nature of  the\n\ncriminal acts at issue in them. The Court finds that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to sever Count\n\n19 and  in opting  instead to  limit the jury's  exposure to  the\n\ndetails of Flynn's prior criminal history.\n\n     D.  Statements Made During Prosecutor's Closing Argument\n                                                             \n\n          Appellant asserts  that the Government  prosecutor made\n\nimproper  comments  during  his  closing  argument  in  which  he\n\nallegedly  injected his  personal opinion  and referred  to facts\n\noutside  the  record  regarding  the truthfulness  of  Government\n\nwitnesses.   This Court  has long held that  a prosecutor may not\n\nplace the prestige of  the government behind a witness  by making\n\n                               -40-\n\npersonal assurances  about the witness' credibility  nor indicate\n\nthat  facts not before the jury support the testimony. See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States  v. Martin, 815  F.2d 818, 821-22  (1st Cir. 1987),\n                        \n\ncert. denied, 484  U.S. 825  (1987); United States  v. Rosa,  705\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  1375,  1379-80  (1st  Cir. 1983).    Appellant specifically\n\npoints  to the  following  comments to  support  his argument  of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct:\n\n            Comment 1:   Much  comment has  been made\n                     \n            about deals.   It would seem to me that a\n            17-year stretch in prison isn't much of a\n            deal.\n\n            Comment 2:  Believe me.  Richard Ferguson\n                      \n            remembers what  he  remembers.   So  does\n            Arthur Cosgro.  So does Tom McQueeny.  So\n            does Brian Raineri.   So do all the other\n            witnesses  in the  case.   Sometimes they\n            don't match with  each other.   Sometimes\n            they don't match with other people at the\n            offenses.    And  that's  fine.   They're\n            telling  what they remember.  These guys,\n            as somebody said,  are not great abstract\n            thinkers.   I think  we can all  agree to\n            that . . . . Which is  it? . . . . Do  we\n            know?  No, we don't know.  We  can choose\n            to believe which of those  is accurate or\n            who remembers better.\n\n            Comment 3:  These people believe, rightly\n                      \n            or wrongly that they might have had  some\n            criminal exposure.   Even if they  did, I\n            think we can all agree  its substantially\n            less than the individuals who are charged\n            with the crimes in this indictment.\n\n          Comment  2  was  not  the  subject  of  contemporaneous\n\nobjection and will  be treated  first.  Absent  plain error,  the\n\nfailure  to  object during  the prosecutor's  argument forecloses\n\nappellate review.   United States v.  Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n849,  854  (1st  Cir. 1993)(stating  that   plain-error  standard\n\n                               -41-\n\nrequires  reversal  of a  conviction  only if  a  \"miscarriage of\n                                             \n\njustice would otherwise result\").  This Court does not find plain\n\nerror.  Other than the phrase, \"Believe me,\"  which appears to be\n\nan expression of personal  opinion only if read out  of the total\n\ncontext, the  prosecutor's comment does not  improperly vouch for\n\nthe  credibility of  Government  witnesses.   The comment  merely\n\npoints out that the witnesses, telling the story as they remember\n\nit,  have generated a number of inconsistencies in the record and\n\nthat it is up to jury to resolve these issues.23\n\n          The Court  finds likewise  that comment 1  falls within\n\npermissible boundaries.   When  read in  context, the  phrase \"it\n\nseems  to  me\"  does not  amount  to  improper  vouching for  the\n\ncredibility  of  a  Government  witness because  the  comment  is\n\nlimited to the terms  of the plea agreement.  \"It is not error to\n\ninform a  jury of  the contents  of a plea  agreement, nor  is it\n\nimproper  for  the government  to  call attention  to  a witness'\n\nmotivation for testifying.\"   United States v. Dockray,  943 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n152, 156  (1st Cir. 1991).24   Especially here, where  the record\n\n                    \n\n23  Even if a contemporaneous objection had  been made, comment 2\nstill does  not rise to error sufficient  to warrant a new trial.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Rodr guez-Estrada,  877 F.2d 153 (1st\n                                             \nCir. 1989)(where prosecutor explicitly  assured jury that witness\nwould   tell  truth,   error  not   reversible  because   it  was\ncounterbalanced by other statements  of prosecutor telling jurors\nthere was conflicting evidence on  issues testified to by witness\nand reminded jury that they  should determine issues of  demeanor\nand credibility).\n\n24  Appellant suggests that  this comment misrepresented the plea\nagreement  of Arthur  Cosgro, who  testified that  the Government\npromised  to recommend  eight  years at  sentencing.   This Court\nagrees\nwith the Government, however,  that the comment actually referred\n\n                               -42-\n\nindicates  that  defense counsel  focused  much  of their  cross-\n\nexamination and closing arguments on  the benefits to be bestowed\n\non cooperating co-conspirators,  the comment  that \"a  seventeen-\n\nyear  stretch in prison isn't much of  a deal\" does not amount to\n\nprosecutorial misconduct.  See Martin,  815 F.2d at 822  (finding\n                                     \n\nno prosecutorial misconduct where  prosecutor told jury that each\n\nof  the  Government  witnesses  expects  to go  to  jail;  \"[t]he\n\nGovernment is  going to  recommend substantial jail,  the maximum\n\npenalty is  five years, and even with  good time off, five years,\n\nfour  years  in a  Federal Penitentiary,  that's  no walk  in the\n\npark\").\n\n          Appellant  argues   that  in  making   comment  3,  the\n\nprosecutor  improperly  interjected  his  personal  opinion  that\n\nAppellant was guilty and asserted that all  other trial witnesses\n\nagreed   with   the   Government's   assessment.      Appellant's\n\ninterpretation  of comment 3 is far-fetched.  The most this Court\n\ncan glean from the  comment is that (1) the  Government witnesses\n\nwere  motivated  to testify,  at least  in  part, because  of the\n\nprospect of  criminal prosecution and that  (2) their involvement\n\nin the conspiracy, as disclosed by their testimony, when compared\n\nwith the  conduct alleged  against defendants in  the indictment,\n\nindicated that  the witnesses were less  culpable than defendants\n\nin the overall conspiracy.  This comment  is proper argumentation\n\nbased on  the evidence  before the  jury and  does not amount  to\n\n                    \n\nto the plea agreement of Richard Ferguson, who testified that the\nprosecution would recommend seventeen years.\n\n                               -43-\n\nimproper vouching for the credibility of witnesses or a  personal\n\nopinion as to the guilt of the defendants.\n\n          Finding  no evidence  of  prosecutorial misconduct,  we\n\nneed not reach the issue of whether the comments in question were\n\nlikely  to have prejudiced  Appellant by altering  the outcome of\n\nthe  case.

CHALLENGES RAISED SEPARATELY BY KENNEY\n                                                      \n\n           A.  The Court's Denial of Motion to Dismiss\n                                                      \n        Indictment Under Interstate Agreement on Detainers\n                                                          \n\n          Appellant Kenney argues that  the district court  erred\n\nin  refusing  to  dismiss  his indictment  under  the  Interstate\n\nAgreement on Detainers Act,    2, Art. IV, 18 U.S.C.  App. (\"IAD\"\n\nor  \"Act\").   The  IAD  establishes  procedures for  transfer  of\n\nprisoners  incarcerated  in  one  jurisdiction  to the  temporary\n\ncustody  of  another  jurisdiction  where  criminal  charges  are\n\npending.  It\n\nsets  time  limits for  trying  prisoners  transferred under  its\n\nprovisions, with the purpose  of encouraging the \"expeditious and\n\norderly disposition\" of outstanding charges. IAD, Art. I.  \n\n          Kenney  argues  that the  indictment  should  have been\n\ndismissed based on the following violations of the IAD:\n\n            Violation of Art.  IV(a), which  provides\n                                    \n            for a thirty-day period \"after receipt by\n            the  appropriate  authorities before  the\n            request   [for   temporary  custody]   be\n            honored, within which period the Governor\n            of the sending  State may disapprove  the\n            request   for    temporary   custody   or\n            availability, either upon his  own motion\n            or upon motion of the prisoner\";\n\n                               -44-\n\n            Violation of Art. IV(d),  which indicates\n                                   \n            that the Act does not deprive a  prisoner\n            of any  right to contest the  legality of\n            his extradition to the receiving state;\n\n            Violation of Art.  IV(c), which  provides\n                                    \n            that \"trial shall be commenced within one\n            hundred and twenty days of the arrival of\n            the prisoner in the receiving  State, but\n            for good  cause shown in open  court, the\n            prisoner  or  his counsel  being present,\n            the  court  having  jurisdiction  of  the\n            matter   may   grant  any   necessary  or\n            reasonable continuance.\"\n\nKenney  failed to raise  Articles IV(a) and IV(d)  as a basis for\n\nhis motion to dismiss below; hence, he has waived those arguments\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim P.  12(b) and 12(f).  We have considered\n\nwhether these  claims constitute  plain error and  have concluded\n\nthat they do not.\n\n          Kenney did raise  Art. IV(c) on several  occasions as a\n\nbasis for  objecting to  motions  for continuances  filed by  co-\n\ndefendants and ultimately in a  motion to dismiss his indictment,\n\narguing that the  court failed to try him within  120 days of his\n\nappearance  in the  jurisdiction of  New Hampshire.    Kenney was\n\nbrought to  the District  of New  Hampshire on  May 7, 1992,  and\n\ntrial, pursuant  to a strict application of the 120-day deadline,\n\nshould have commenced on September 8, 1992.25  \n\n          In  denying  Kenney's  motion  to  dismiss,  the  judge\n\nindicated  that continuing  the  trial until  October  5 did  not\n\nviolate the  120-day provision because the clock  had been tolled\n\nfor twenty-eight  days, from  August 4  through August  31, 1992,\n\n                    \n\n25  September 5, 1992,  was exactly 120 days, but that  date fell\non a holiday weekend.\n\n                               -45-\n\nwhile  the magistrate  judge resolved  pretrial motions  filed by\n\nKenney.  The  judge also  ruled that delays  attributable to  the\n\ndisposition of motions  filed by other co-defendants  constituted\n\n\"good  cause\" under  the  IAD and  were  also excluded  from  the\n\ncomputation.\n\n          This Court has recently  suggested that delay caused by\n\na court's resolution of  pending co-defendant motions may qualify\n                                                         \n\nas excludible time under  Article IV(c) of the IAD  which states,\n\n\"for  good cause  shown in  open court . . . the  court . . . may\n\ngrant any necessary or reasonable continuance.\"  Whiting v. U.S.,\n                                                                \n\nNo. 92-1182, slip op. at 29-30 (1st Cir. July 6, 1994).  However,\n\nthe facts of  this case allow us to affirm  the court's denial of\n\nKenney's motion to dismiss on a narrower ground; i.e., that delay\n                                                     \n\nattributable  to   the  disposition  of  motions   filed  by  the\n\ndefendant, himself, is excludible from the 120-day computation.\n\n          Art. VI(a) of the  IAD provides that the  120-day clock\n\n\"shall be  tolled whenever and  for as  long as  the prisoner  is\n\nunable to  stand trial.\"   This  Court has  generally interpreted\n\nthis provision to allow for tolling during the time that it takes\n\nfor the  court to resolve matters raised  by the defendant who is\n\nclaiming rights under the IAD.  Whiting, No. 92-1182, slip op. at\n                                       \n\n27-28;  United States v. Walker, 924 F.2d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1991),\n                               \n\nUnited  States v. Taylor,  861 F.2d 316,  321-22 (1st Cir. 1988).\n                        \n\nWe have held out the possibility, however, that where a defendant\n\ntimely advises the court  that he or she is  claiming protections\n\nunder the  IAD and the court takes more time than is necessary to\n                  \n\n                               -46-\n\nresolve the defendant's pretrial motions, then the delay may  not\n\nbe fully excluded from the 120-day clock.\n\n          In this case, Kenney first informed the court on June 5\n\nthat he refused to waive any rights under the IAD  in response to\n\na Government  motion relating  to bail.   On  August 4,  he filed\n\nseven  pretrial motions but did not  refer to his reliance on the\n\nIAD  to  notify the  magistrate that  an expedited  decision was,\n\nperhaps, warranted.  The Government submitted responses on August\n\n14, and the magistrate ruled on the motions on August 31.  Kenney\n\ninformed the court that  he was specifically relying on  the 120-\n\nday trial provision on  September 1, when he filed  objections to\n\nmotions by co-defendants seeking a continuance of the trial date.\n\n          In these  circumstances, the Court finds  that a 28-day\n\ndelay in  resolving defendant's own motions  was not unreasonable\n\nand that after excluding this delay, trial was properly commenced\n\nwithin  the  120-day  deadline.26   Accordingly,  we  affirm  the\n\ndistrict  court's  denial  of  Kenney's  motion  to  dismiss  his\n\nindictment.  \n\nB.  The Court's Admission into Evidence of Semi-Automatic Handgun\n                                                                 \n\n          Appellant Kenney challenges the court's  admission into\n\nevidence of  Government exhibit 42, a  .32 caliber semi-automatic\n\nhandgun.  Specifically, Kenney  argues that the Government failed\n\nto  introduce sufficient evidence that  (1) the gun  had not been\n\n                    \n\n26  According to  this Court's calculations, the  120-day period,\nexcluding the twenty-eight-day delay occasioned by defendant, ran\non October  3, 1992, which  was a Saturday.   Trial was  properly\ncommenced on the first day of the business week, October 5, 1992.\n\n                               -47-\n\naltered subsequent to the  crime and (2)  the gun was the  actual\n\ngun used  in the crimes  in question.   We need  not belabor  the\n\npoint because we find that  the district court did not abuse  its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the handgun.\n\n          Federal  Rule of  Evidence  901(a) requires  the  trial\n\ncourt to  determine if there  is a \"reasonable  probability\" that\n\nthe evidence is what it is purported to be.   Evidence before the\n\ncourt indicated  that the  gun had  been stored  in a  garage for\n\nthirteen  days.   Even though the  garage was  used as  a storage\n\nfacility by  several people, testimony at trial  indicated that a\n\nco-conspirator's relative  retrieved  the handgun  from the  same\n\nplace that it had been left by Kenney and Flynn.  Considering the\n\nnature    of   the   handgun,   circumstances   surrounding   its\n\npreservation,  and  the  scant likelihood  of  intermeddlers, the\n\njudge properly determined that  it was in substantially the  same\n\ncondition.\n\n          The  trial court also  did not abuse  its discretion in\n\ndetermining  that there  was  a reasonable  probability that  the\n\nhandgun  was the  same  gun used  in the  robberies.   Three  co-\n\nconspirators  identified  the  handgun,  and  a  co-conspirator's\n\nrelative identified the case  in which the handgun was  found and\n\ntestified that she  heard Flynn tell Kenney  to hide the case  in\n\nthe garage.  In addition, testimony by witnesses to the robberies\n\ndescribed a gun matching the Government's exhibit.\n\n                               -48-\n\n        VI.  SEPARATE CHALLENGES RAISED BY APPELLANT NEAL\n                                                         \n\n      A.  Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Guilty Verdict \n                                                            \n on Counts Alleging Accessory After The Fact and Money Laundering\n                                                                 \n\n          Appellant  Neal  challenges  the  sufficiency   of  the\n\nevidence  in support of the  jury's guilty verdicts  on Counts 30\n\nand 31.27   This Court  finds that  the evidence,  viewed in  the\n\nlight  most  favorable  to  the  Government,  together  with  all\n\nlegitimate inferences,  was of such  a quantum that  a reasonable\n                                              \n\ntrier of fact could find Neal guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on\n\nboth counts.28  United  States v. Browne, 891 F.2d  389, 393 (1st\n                                        \n\n                    \n\n27  Count 30,  alleging accessory after the fact in  violation of\ntitle 18 U.S.C.    3, requires  proof beyond  a reasonable  doubt\nthat a defendant (1)  knew an offense had been  committed against\nthe  United  States; and  (2)  \"receives,  relieves, comforts  or\nassists   the  offender  in  order   to  hinder  or  prevent  his\napprehension, trial or punishment . . . .\" \n\n   Count 31,  alleging money laundering in violation  of title 18\nU.S.C.    1956(a)(1)(B)(i), requires  proof  beyond a  reasonable\ndoubt that a defendant knew that:\n\n            the  property  involved  in  a  financial\n            transaction  represents  the proceeds  of\n            some  form  of  unlawful  activity  [and]\n            conducts  such  a  financial  transaction\n            which  in fact  involves the  proceeds of\n            specified unlawful activity, knowing that\n            the transaction  is designed in  whole or\n            in  part,  to  conceal  or  disguise  the\n            nature,  the  location,  the source,  the\n            ownership, or the control of the proceeds\n            of specified unlawful activity . . . .\n\n28  The evidence consisted, in part, of testimony indicating that\nNeal  was at his  home on several  occasions when co-conspirators\nmet  to discuss the bank  robbery and to  make final preparations\nfor  committing the  crime.   The co-conspirators took  refuge in\nNeal's home  immediately following the robbery  with a reasonable\ninference from the  testimony being that  Neal opened his  cellar\ndoor to  let them in.  Neal  followed Flynn's instructions to \"go\nout and get the box of money\"  out of the car, with the box  also\ncontaining the gun used in the  robbery.  Tr. (October 14,  1992)\n\n                               -49-\n\nCir. 1989).  \n\n                 B.  Court's Denial of Motion for\n                                                 \n            Downward Adjustment of Base Offense Level\n                                                     \n\n          Neal  challenges  the  district court's  denial  of his\n\nmotion  for  a downward  adjustment  of  his Base  Offense  Level\n\npursuant  to  section  3B1.2(a)  of  the  Sentencing  Guidelines.\n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.2(a).  That section of the Guidelines provides for\n\na  four-level  reduction  where   the  court  determines  that  a\n\ndefendant was a minimal  participant in the offense for  which he\n\nwas  convicted and is intended to cover only those defendants who\n\nare  clearly the least culpable of those involved in the criminal\n\nconduct  of the group.  See  U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(a), comment nn. 1 &amp;\n                           \n\n2.   Absent a  mistake of law,  a district court's  finding as to\n\nwhether  a defendant was a  minor or minimal  participant will be\n\nreversed only if clearly  erroneous.  United States v.  Brum, 948\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 817 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Here,  the   court's  determination  was   not  clearly\n\nerroneous and we affirm.   Neal mistakenly refers to  the overall\n\nconspiracy  encompassing  five  robberies as  the  benchmark  for\n\narguing that he played a minimal role.  But section 3B1.2 focuses\n\non  the role  of a  defendant with respect  to the  offense(s) of\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\nat 40.  Neal was given  between $2000-$5000 as his split from the\nproceeds  of  the  robbery.    Flynn  later  furnished  him  with\nadditional  money from the robbery to pay off hundreds of dollars\nin parking tickets  and to purchase a car in his  name to be used\nby  Flynn  and  Kenney to  drive  to  Arizona  and eventually  to\nCalifornia.  A friend of Neal's testified that he told her he had\nwon the money  used to purchase  the car by  betting on  football\ngames and had purchased  the car with the intention  of letting a\nfriend use it for a week or so.\n\n                               -50-\n\nwhich  he was  convicted.   Here,  Neal  was convicted  of  money\n                        \n\nlaundering and being  an accessory  after the fact.   He was  the\n\nonly  defendant indicted and convicted  on the count  of being an\n\naccessory  after the fact and  was indicted and convicted jointly\n\nwith Flynn on the money laundering  count.  The facts support the\n\ncourt's  determination that Neal did not play a minimal role with\n\nrespect to the conduct alleged in either count.\n\n                         VII.  CONCLUSION\n                                         \n\n          Accordingly,  the Court  affirms  the district  court's\n\nrulings on all issues raised on appeal except the issue raised by\n                                             \n\nAppellant Flynn  regarding the court's denial  of various motions\n\nfor production of witness statements under the Jencks Act and the\n\nissue raised  by Appellant  Neal regarding  the court's order  of\n\nrestitution against  him.  We will  retain appellate jurisdiction\n\nto  enable  us to  review the  augmented  record and  the court's\n\nsubsequent  determinations  on  the Jencks  Act  and  restitution\n\nclaims.\n\n          With respect to Appellant Flynn's challenge,  we remand\n\nthe  case  for  an   evidentiary  hearing  to  determine  whether\n\nstatements  were improperly  withheld  from him  during trial  in\n\nviolation  of the Jencks Act and, if so, whether nondisclosure of\n\nsuch  statements constituted  harmless  error.   With respect  to\n\nAppellant  Neal's challenge, we remand the case so that the court\n\nmay determine  whether the  full amount  of  damages suffered  by\n\nFirst  N.H.  was  caused   by  the  criminal  conduct  underlying\n\nAppellant's  convictions  for  money  laundering  and  being   an\n\n                               -51-\n\naccessory after the fact.   The court should report  its findings\n\nand  determinations back to us within ninety  (90) days.  We will\n\nretain appellate jurisdiction for the time being.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n                          \n\n                               -52-\n\n           APPENDIX I:  LISTING OF JENCKS ACT RULINGS \n                                                     \n                   TO BE RECONSIDERED ON REMAND\n                                               \n\n          Below find  examples where the court  indicated that it\n\nwas denying  Jencks Act requests on the  ground that there was no\n\nshowing  that the  witness had  seen and  adopted the  statements\n\npursuant to 18  U.S.C.   3500 (e)(1).   The court failed to  make\n\nthe  further inquiry,  pursuant to  18 U.S.C.    3500 (e)(2),  of\n\nwhether  the notes  or  interview reports  of government  agents,\n\nrequested    by   counsel,   contained   statements   that   were\n\nsubstantially verbatim recitals  of a witness'  prior statements.\n\nRulings  made pursuant  to  this erroneous  standard include  the\n\nfollowing:  \n\n(1)  After  the Government  conducted direct  examination on\n     Anita Ramsdell,  a teller  at  First N.H.,  Appellant's\n     counsel requested all  Jencks material on the  witness.\n     The court indicated:\n\n          I   looked  at   it  and   it's  not   Jencks\n          material. . . . But I can't really rule on it\n          at  this point  until somebody  asks her  the\n          question if she's ever seen it.\n\n     Tr.   (October  9, 1992)  at 6.    Cross-examination by\n     Appellant's  counsel indicated that  an FBI  agent took\n     notes for a half hour  to forty-five minutes while  the\n     witness was  being questioned  by a detective  from the\n     Stratham  police department  but she  further testified\n     that  she never saw  the notes.   Id. at 34-37.   It is\n                                          \n     presumably on this  basis, that witness Anita  Ramsdell\n     never  saw or adopted the notes,  that the court denied\n     counsel's Jencks request.  \n\n(2)  While   Appellant's   counsel  was   conducting  cross-\n     examination upon Richard Ferguson, a co-conspirator who\n     pled  guilty  and   cooperated  with  the   Government,\n     Ferguson   testified  that   he  met   with  Government\n     attorneys Patrick  Walsh and  Robert Veiga and  someone\n     from the FBI  on at least  two different occasions  and\n     that Walsh  was probably  taking notes.   Counsel asked\n     for a sidebar:\n\n                               -53-\n\n          Counsel:   There  are  four to  six hours  of\n          statements that someone took  notes on. . . .\n          I  would  suggest  that there  must  be  some\n          Jencks material . . . .\n\n          Court:    So  far  I can't  agree  with  you,\n          counsel, but your objection is noted.\n\n     Tr. (October 14, 1992) at 140.\n\n     On further cross-examination  of Ferguson, he testified\n     that  Government  attorney  Walsh  went over  the  same\n     things  with  him in  the  second  interview that  were\n     covered in  the first  interview.  Counsel  again asked\n     for  a  sidebar requesting  that  the  court order  the\n     Government  to  turn  over  materials  from  the  first\n     interview based on the  witness' testimony that he went\n     over these materials with the Government attorney:\n\n          Government:  Your Honor,  it is not.  I  mean\n          all he  said so far is  that -- as I remember\n          his  testimony -- is  that he  went  over the\n          same things in each interview.\n\n          Court:   That is  my  understanding, but  the\n          objection of the defense is noted.\n\n          Counsel:     Your   Honor,  wait   a  minute.\n          Unfortunately I must admit I don't understand\n          what's  going on  here,  but I  am trying  to\n          figure it out.   Am I  to understand that  at\n          some point  is work product  being interposed\n          here  for the basis of why we are not getting\n          these materials? \n          . . . .\n          Counsel:   The reason  is that you  have been\n          given  documents which you have reviewed, and\n          within those  documents somehow he  has never\n          adopted  them,  so that's  why  we don't  get\n          them?\n\n          Court:  The  record before me is that  he has\n          never adopted those documents.\n           . . . . \n          Court:   If I  am wrong  I will  be reversed.\n          Your objection is noted.\n          . . . .\n          Counsel:   I want the record  to reflect that\n          in my  opinion what I now  understand is that\n          this  is a  very clever  manipulation of  the\n          rules by the United States Government in  the\n          District  of  New  Hampshire  to  avoid  ever\n\n                               -54-\n\n          giving Jencks material, because what we do is\n          if we never ask the witness to adopt it, that\n          if there is no  steno present, we can clearly\n          say there is not Jencks material . . . .\n\n     Tr.  (October 14, 1992) at 152-53.\n\n(3)  The  court  denied  production of  Jencks  material  on\n     witness  Linda Sherouse  who worked  at the  Dress Barn\n     retail store and was victim of a night deposit robbery.\n     When Sherouse was testifying on direct examination with\n     respect to  the gun used  by the robber,  counsel asked\n     for a side bar:\n\n          Counsel:   Now  I'd  like to  know where  her\n          Jencks  material is.  Where's her statements?\n          Where's  a description  of this?   Where's  a\n          prior statement  of this  or  why hasn't  she\n          been shown this?\n\n          Government:  She gave a statement at the time\n          of  the  incident to  the  local authorities,\n          which was Hampton  Police Department I guess.\n          But there  has been  no Jencks  material with\n          respect to that.\n          . . . .\n          Court:  Why don't  you give him the statement\n          she made to the Hampton cops.\n\n          Government:   She  hasn't  reviewed it.   She\n          hasn't reviewed it.  It's not Jencks.\n\n          Court:  Can I review it?\n\n          Government:  Sure, certainly.\n          . . . .\n          Court:  For the  record, I have reviewed them\n          and I  don't think  there's either  Jencks or\n          Brady material in them.\n\n     Tr.  (October 27, 1992 -- Afternoon session) at 86-88.\n\n(4)  Other  examples  where  the  court  may  have  used  an\n     erroneous  legal  ground  in  denying  Jencks  requests\n     include  a  request  for  Jencks  material  on  Douglas\n     Scamman.   Scamman  is  a dairy  farmer who  identified\n     Appellant  Flynn in court as one of several men whom he\n     observed on  various occasions  loitering near a  field\n     that was allegedly used  by the armed robbers  to reach\n     and  escape from First N.H.  Counsel asked the court to\n     order  production  of  Jencks  or  Brady  material with\n     respect  to statements  made by  Scamman that  might be\n\n                               -55-\n\n     included in a report  filed by a Sergeant Forbes.   The\n     court denied  the request.   Tr. (October 19,  1992) at\n     171-73.  \n\n     The  court  also  denied   a  Jencks  Act  request  for\n     statements made  by  co-conspirator Arthur  Cosgro  who\n     cooperated with the Government.  Counsel indicated that\n     he had been given no materials that would shed light on\n     testimony  by  Cosgro  with  respect  to  a  particular\n     conversation that he had with Appellant Flynn.  Counsel\n     questioned  whether the  basis of the  statement should\n     have been  disclosed in  his Jencks  Act request.   Tr.\n     (October 20, 1992) at 73-77.\n\n     The  court   denied  Jencks   Act  requests   on  prior\n     statements contained in reports of interviews with  co-\n     conspirators Thomas  McQueeney and Brian  Raineri, both\n     of whom cooperated with the Government.   It is unclear\n     whether  an erroneous  legal ground  was used  in these\n     denials.    Tr.  (October  28,  1992)  at  20  and  Tr.\n     (November 3, 1992) at 219-20.\n\n                               -56-\n",

Appellants  Charles\n                                         \n\nFlynn, William Kenney, and  Gary Neal were found guilty by a jury\n\non a number of criminal  charges stemming from a series of  armed\n\nrobberies that took place in New Hampshire.  Appellants challenge\n\ntheir convictions on the basis  of various pre-trial, trial,  and\n\npost-trial rulings issued by the court as well as statements made\n\nby the Government.  We affirm on all but two of the issues raised\n\nby Appellants.\n\n          The first  of these issues involves  various Jencks Act\n\nrequests  made by  Appellant  Flynn.   We  find that  the  record\n\nindicates the district judge may  have applied an erroneous legal\n\nstandard  in ruling  that  various materials  did not  qualify as\n\nstatements  under the Jencks Act.  Accordingly, we will remand to\n\nthe  district  court  for  an evidentiary  hearing  to  determine\n\nwhether statements  demanded by Appellant Flynn  should have been\n\ndisclosed under the Jencks Act and,  if so, whether nondisclosure\n\nconstituted harmless error.  We also remand to the district court\n\non  the  issue  of  the  order  of  restitution  entered  against\n\nAppellant  Neal with  instructions  that  a  hearing be  held  to\n\ndetermine whether the full amount  of monetary losses suffered by\n\nFirst New  Hampshire Bank was  caused by  the conduct  underlying\n\nNeal's convictions.  \n\n          At this  point  in the  proceedings, we  choose not  to\n\nvacate the court's Jencks Act rulings or the order of restitution\n\nbut  instead remand to the district court for the limited purpose\n\nof  making supplemental findings with regard to these two issues.\n\n                               -3-\n\nIn  the interim, we will retain appellate jurisdiction so that we\n\nmay   review  the   court's  augmented   record  and   subsequent\n\ndeterminations.\n\n                        FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n                                          \n\n          Appellants  were tried by a jury in the District of New\n\nHampshire during the months of October and November of 1992.

Several  other  alleged co-conspirators,\n\nincluding  Arthur  Cosgro  and Thomas  McQueeney,  also  provided\n\nevidence against Appellants.    \n\n          The  evidence presented during the thirty-one-day trial\n\nis  sufficient  to justify  the  following  conclusions of  fact.\n\nAppellant  Charles Flynn,  a/k/a  \"Chuckie,\" was  the leader  and\n\norganizer of  the group  of  co-conspirators.   Flynn scoped  out\n\nrobbery  locations, devised  the plans,  and recruited  others to\n\ncommit  or  assist  in  the  crimes.    Appellant William  Kenney\n\nparticipated  as  the gunman  and  shared  in  proceeds  of  four\n\n                               -6-\n\nrobberies planned by Flynn,  excluding the Market Basket robbery.\n\nKenney also assisted Flynn in \n\n                               -7-\n\nsurveilling armored  cars that serviced various  stores and banks\n\nwhich were prospective robbery sites.  Appellant Gary Neal played\n\na  more limited role in the overall conspiracy (this is reflected\n\nby the  fact that he was  indicted on only four  counts and found\n\nguilty  on two  counts  limited  to  the  bank  robbery).2    The\n\nevidence demonstrated  that Neal  provided his  home  to the  co-\n\nconspirators where they planned the bank  robbery and took refuge\n\nafter  they  committed  the  crime.   Immediately  following  the\n\nrobbery, Neal carried  a box from  the getaway car into  his home\n\ncontaining the gun used in the bank robbery along with the stolen\n\nproceeds.  He also  used proceeds from the robbery to  purchase a\n\ncar  in his name that was  used by Flynn and  Kenney to travel to\n\nArizona and then to  California in order to  escape the scene  of\n\nthe crime.  On their  trip, Flynn and Kenney disposed of  clothes\n\nused in the crime and stored the gun used in all five crimes in a\n\ngarage  belonging  to   Patricia  Ferguson,  a   co-conspirator's\n\nrelative.\n\n          On defendants'  motions at  the close of  the evidence,\n\nthe court dismissed RICO  Counts 1 and 2, finding  the Government\n\nfailed to demonstrate  a sufficient continuity of  offenses.  The\n\ncourt also dismissed  Counts 12,  13, and 23,  all involving  the\n\nPhantom Fireworks robbery.   The jury then rendered its verdicts,\n\nfinding Flynn guilty on all remaining charges  against him except\n                                                                 \n\nCounts 8, 9, and  21, involving the night  deposit robbery of  an\n\n                    \n\n2  The  four counts  include conspiracy to  commit bank  robbery,\naccessory after the  fact to bank robbery, money  laundering, and\ncriminal forfeiture.  \n\n                               -8-\n\nemployee  of Abercrombie  and Finch restaurant.   The  jury found\n\nKenney  guilty on all remaining counts against him except for the\n                                                         \n\ncounts involving the Abercrombie and Finch robbery and found Neal\n\nguilty of being an accessory after the fact and money laundering,\n\nas  alleged  in Counts  30 and  31, but  not  guilty on  count 3,\n\nalleging conspiracy to rob First N.H.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellants raise a litany of challenges against various\n\nrulings issued by the district court judge and statements made by\n\nthe Government throughout the proceedings.  The Court finds merit\n\nin Appellant  Flynn's argument that  both the Government  and the\n\ndistrict judge were operating under an improper legal standard in\n\ndetermining what statements qualified  as Jencks Act material and\n\nshould  have been  disclosed to  the defense  during trial.   The\n\nCourt also  finds merit  in Appellant  Neal's  argument that  the\n\ncourt erred in ordering  $266,500 in restitution against  him for\n\nhis role  in the First  N.H. robbery.   These  arguments will  be\n\ntreated first.  The Court finds no merit in Appellants' remaining\n\nclaims which  will be discussed, in  turn, in the order  of joint\n\nchallenges raised  by Appellants  followed  by challenges  raised\n\nindividually by Flynn, Kenney, and Neal.\n\n                  I.

Brady Claims\n                                         \n\n          Appellant  Flynn has  framed  much of  his argument  on\n\nappeal in  terms of a  Brady violation.   Brady v. Maryland,  373\n                                                           \n\n                               -9-\n\nU.S.  83  (1963)(holding  that   a  prosecutor's  suppression  of\n\nevidence favorable to  and requested by a  defendant violates due\n\nprocess  where   the  evidence  is   material  to  guilt   or  to\n\npunishment).    Appellant  points  to statements  in  the  record\n\nindicating that  the Government attorney  harbored an erroneously\n\nnarrow view  of what materials  were exculpatory and  should have\n\nbeen  disclosed to the defense pursuant to Brady and its progeny.\n                                                \n\nFlynn acknowledges that the  Government provided certain disputed\n\nmaterials to  the trial court for in  camera review.  However, he\n                                            \n\nargues that the Government's erroneous view of what qualified  as\n\nBrady,  as  a  threshold  matter, most  likely  resulted  in  the\n     \n\nwithholding of  many other exculpatory materials  from the court.\n\nHe requests this Court  to unseal the documents that  were turned\n\nover,  remand the case for further hearing in the district court,\n\nand order that the  Government disclose all other Brady  material\n                                                       \n\nin its possession. \n\n          A careful  and thorough  review of the  record supports\n\nAppellant's assertion that  the Government attorney misunderstood\n\nthe reach of  Brady.3   However, in virtually  every instance  of\n                   \n\n                    \n\n3  In one  example of this misunderstanding,  Appellant's counsel\ninquired  whether  any Brady  material  existed  with respect  to\nRichard  Ferguson,  a  co-conspirator  who  cooperated  with  the\nGovernment.  The Government attorney replied:\n\n            First  of all,  it's not  Brady material.\n            If   it's   anything,  it's   impeachment\n            material, if it is even that.  \n\nTr.   (October 19,  1992)  at 115.   In  a  second incident,  the\nGovernment attorney stated that:\n\n            Prior  inconsistent  statements  are  not\n\n                               -10-\n\ndispute  pointed  out  by   Appellant  and  the  Government,  the\n\nGovernment attorney  indicated on  the record that  all materials\n                                                       \n\nrelated to the witness in question were being  turned over to the\n\ndistrict judge  for review.4   Appellant  makes no argument  that\n\n                    \n\n            Brady.   I'll be  happy at some  point to\n            give   Mr.  Wilson   a   lesson  in   the\n            difference between  Brady and impeachment\n            material, but there  is a difference  all\n            the  way up to  the United States Supreme\n            Court.\n\nTr.  (October 20, 1992) at 77.\n\n   These   statements   reflect   a   misunderstanding   on   the\nGovernment's  part  of the  Brady rule.    The Supreme  Court has\n                                 \nclearly  stated that  impeachment  evidence may  well qualify  as\nBrady  material.   United  States v.

The  Act further  requires the\n\ndefendant  to make a motion for production.  18 U.S.C.   3500(b).\n\nSubsection  (e)  defines  \"statements\"  subject  to  the  Act  as\n\nfollows:\n\n          (1)  a  written  statement made  by said\n               witness  and  signed  or  otherwise\n               adopted or approved by him;\n          (2)  a     stenographic,     mechanical,\n               electrical, or  other recording, or\n               a transcription thereof, which is a\n               substantially  verbatim recital  of\n               an  oral  statement  made  by  said\n               witness         and        recorded\n               contemporaneously  with the  making\n               of such oral statement; or\n          (3)  a   statement,  however   taken  or\n               recorded,   or    a   transcription\n               thereof,  if  any,  made   by  said\n               witness to a grand jury.       \n\n18 U.S.C.   3500(e).  \n\n          At issue  in  this case  is  the reach  of  subsections\n\n(e)(1) and  (e)(2) which first came into dispute on the third day\n\nof trial.   18  U.S.C.     3500 (e)(1) and  (e)(2).   Appellant's\n\ncounsel was conducting  cross-examination of Laura  MacPherson, a\n\nteller  for  First  N.H.  who  had  witnessed  the bank  robbery.\n\nMacPherson  testified  that while  she  was  being questioned  by\n\npolice  at the scene  of the crime,  an officer was  taking notes\n\nbased  on what she was  saying.  Appellant's  counsel then called\n\nfor  a  sidebar requesting  that the  Government turn  over these\n\nnotes pursuant to the Jencks Act:\n\n                               -13-\n\n            Court:   It  isn't [Jencks]  unless she's\n            seen it and adopted it.  \n\n            Counsel:   But if  18  3500 controls  [18\n            U.S.C.   3500], as I read it, a statement\n            that  is  taken  down  by   anybody,  she\n            doesn't  have to  adopt  it.   If it's  a\n            written statement taken  down by a person\n            dealing  with  the   subject  matter   in\n            question,  I'm entitled  to  it.   And  I\n            refer to 18 3500(e)(2).    \n\n            Government:      As   I  understand   the\n            application  of  the  cited   rule  under\n            Jencks,  what  counsel  is  referring  to\n            under (e)(2) is a mechanical recording or\n            a  transcription of  a recording  of some\n            kind,  either  stenographic,  mechanical,\n            electrical,   or   other   recording   or\n            transcription of that recording; that is,\n            a transcript.  There is no  such material\n            as  the statement is defined under Jencks\n            as I read the statute in that rule.    \n\n            Court:   That was my understanding of the\n            interpretation of the  statute, sir,  and\n            there  are  none  of  those  stenographic\n            recordings [or] transcriptions.  \n\nTr. (October 8, 1992) at 118, 121-22.\n\n          While   the   Government   attorney  mentioned   \"other\n\nrecording,\"  it is clear from a reading of the entire interchange\n\nthat the  court and Government attorney  disagreed with counsel's\n\nargument  that subsection  (e)(2) of  the Jencks  Act encompasses\n\noral  statements  made  by witnesses  that  are  written down  by\n\ngovernment agents as  they are taking notes on  the conversation,\n\nso long  as such statements are  substantially verbatim accounts.\n\nFurther, the trial record is replete with statements by the court\n\nindicating  that  it  viewed  subsections (e)(1)  and  (e)(2)  as\n\nlimited to statements  that are  either adopted by  a witness  or\n\n                               -14-\n\nrecorded through stenographic or some kind of mechanical means.5\n\n          This legal basis, cited  as the ground for many  of the\n\ncourt's Jencks Act rulings, is erroneous.  Since 1959, the United\n\nStates  Supreme Court has held  that the phrase \"other recording\"\n\nin subsection  (e)(2)  \"was meant  to  encompass more  than  mere\n\nautomatic reproductions  of oral statements.\"   Palermo v.

We note that  during the Rule  30 sidebar regarding\nobjections to  the instructions, Appellants did  not request that\nthe district court clarify  the sense in  which it used the  word\n\"medium.\"  In  addition, we  find that a  reasonable juror  would\nhave  interpreted  \"medium\"   in  accordance   with  the   second\ndefinition where  the judge used  \"beyond a reasonable  doubt\" in\nthe  same  sentence  and  made  clear that  the  latter  standard\nrepresented the Government's burden of proof:\n\n            this  presumption  of  innocence  can  be\n\n                               -26-\n\n          Appellants ask  the Court to reconsider  its holding in\n\nOlmstead  in  light  of  recent Supreme  Court  decisions.

The  cases all involve  judicial\n                             \n\nattempts to  define reasonable doubt and  recognize that attempts\n\nto  imbue  the  phrase with  exact  definition  are  fraught with\n\npitfalls.

The bank\n\nemployee testified that the robber  was wearing a white styrofoam\n\nwoodworker's mask that stood  out from his  face and that he  was\n\nwearing a Patagonia jacket  and a pair of  jeans.  McQueeney,  on\n\nthe  other  hand,  indicated  that  Kenney  was wearing  a  white\n\npainter's mask made of cloth and a blue runner's suit.14\n\n          Viewed in  the light most favorable  to the Government,\n\nthe identification testimony supports the  jury's guilty verdict.\n\n                    \n\n14   The remaining evidence consisted of  additional testimony by\nMcQueeny  who stated that  he and Flynn  watched Kenney  try on a\nwhite  cloth painter's  mask  and that,  at  Flynn's request,  he\ndropped Kenney off near  First National Bank on the  night of the\nrobbery carrying a  bag with the mask,  the gun, and  the gloves.\nHe also testified about an argument the next morning during which\nFlynn  scolded  Kenney for  robbing women  with  only $600.   The\nemployee was unable to identify Kenney but was able to testify to\nhis  approximate  height and  age.   She  also testified  that he\ncarried a  handgun similar to the semi-automatic  admitted by the\nGovernment as Exhibit 42 and that the stolen proceeds belonged to\na business involved in interstate commerce.  Co-conspirator Brian\nRaineri testified, indicating that  he had discussions with Flynn\non  how to  rob  night depositories,  and co-conspirator  Richard\nFerguson testified that Kenney later admitted to robbing a couple\nof night depositories.\n\n                               -29-\n\nMcQueeney  indicated  that he  dropped  Kenney off  with  a white\n\npainter's  mask and  a gun  near the  scene of  the  robbery; the\n\nemployee  testified  that  her  assailant  was  wearing  a  white\n\ncarpenter's mask and carrying a gun similar to Government Exhibit\n\n42.   McQueeney also supplied evidence  of conspiracy, testifying\n\nthat  Flynn  watched  as  Kenney  tried  on  the  mask,  directed\n\nMcQueeney to drop Kenney off near First National Bank, and argued\n\nwith Kenney the  following morning for targeting women  with only\n\n$600.  Kenney  later admitted to co-conspirator  Ferguson that he\n\nrobbed  some  night depositories.    While the  evidence  may not\n\ncompel  guilty verdicts,  this  Court  finds  that  it  is  of  a\n      \n\nsufficient quantum  that a reasonable  trier of  fact could  find\n                  \n\nAppellants  guilty  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  on  the  counts\n\ninvolving the  Dress  Barn robbery.

Appellants  argue\n         \n\nthat prejudice  resulted because the jury was  exposed to certain\n\nevidence that would otherwise have been inadmissible against them\n\nwithout the RICO counts.  They specifically point to testimony by\n\nofficials  of the New Hampshire State Police who observed them on\n\nnumerous occasions  surveilling armored trucks in preparation for\n\nthe  First N.H.  robbery.

In essence, Flynn had nearly four months\n\nto secure  private counsel -- from May 28,  1992, until September\n\n18,  1992.   The trial date  was continued  for one  month at his\n\nbehest;  yet he continually failed  to meet deadlines  set by the\n\ncourt.  Given these  circumstances, the Court affirms the  denial\n\nof Flynn's belated  September 25 motion  for continuance and  his\n\nlater motion to reconsider.19  \n\n           B.

R. Evid.  602 (witness may not  testify to a\n\nmatter without evidence that  she had \"personal knowledge of  the\n\nmatter\").   In  particular,  Appellant argues  that Haskins,  who\n\nworked  as an insurance compliance specialist for First N.H., did\n\nnot commence her employment  until a month after the  robbery, so\n\nher testimony was based on records that she was exposed to in the\n\ncourse of her later employment and not on knowledge formed at the\n\ntime of the robbery.\n\n          Evidence is inadmissible under Rule 602 \"only if in the\n\nproper exercise of the trial court's discretion it finds that the\n\nwitness could  not have actually perceived or observed that which\n\nhe testified to.\"  Hallquist v.

Flynn's counsel\n\nlater indicated that  he would  stipulate to his  client being  a\n\nconvicted  felon and stipulate that the  court could instruct the\n\njury in that regard.  In its final instructions to  the jury, the\n\ncourt  indicated that the parties  had stipulated to  the fact of\n\nthe  prior conviction(s),  without  detailing the  nature of  the\n\ncriminal acts at issue in them. The Court finds that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to sever Count\n\n19 and  in opting  instead to  limit the jury's  exposure to  the\n\ndetails of Flynn's prior criminal history.\n\n     D.  Statements Made During Prosecutor's Closing Argument\n                                                             \n\n          Appellant asserts  that the Government  prosecutor made\n\nimproper  comments  during  his  closing  argument  in  which  he\n\nallegedly  injected his  personal opinion  and referred  to facts\n\noutside  the  record  regarding  the truthfulness  of  Government\n\nwitnesses.   This Court  has long held that  a prosecutor may not\n\nplace the prestige of  the government behind a witness  by making\n\n                               -40-\n\npersonal assurances  about the witness' credibility  nor indicate\n\nthat  facts not before the jury support the testimony.

Appellant specifically\n\npoints  to the  following  comments to  support  his argument  of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct:\n\n            Comment 1:   Much  comment has  been made\n                     \n            about deals.   It would seem to me that a\n            17-year stretch in prison isn't much of a\n            deal.\n\n            Comment 2:  Believe me.  Richard Ferguson\n                      \n            remembers what  he  remembers.   So  does\n            Arthur Cosgro.  So does Tom McQueeny.  So\n            does Brian Raineri.   So do all the other\n            witnesses  in the  case.   Sometimes they\n            don't match with  each other.   Sometimes\n            they don't match with other people at the\n            offenses.    And  that's  fine.   They're\n            telling  what they remember.  These guys,\n            as somebody said,  are not great abstract\n            thinkers.   I think  we can all  agree to\n            that . . . . Which is  it? . . . . Do  we\n            know?  No, we don't know.  We  can choose\n            to believe which of those  is accurate or\n            who remembers better.\n\n            Comment 3:  These people believe, rightly\n                      \n            or wrongly that they might have had  some\n            criminal exposure.   Even if they  did, I\n            think we can all agree  its substantially\n            less than the individuals who are charged\n            with the crimes in this indictment.\n\n          Comment  2  was  not  the  subject  of  contemporaneous\n\nobjection and will  be treated  first.  Absent  plain error,  the\n\nfailure  to  object during  the prosecutor's  argument forecloses\n\nappellate review.   United States v.

This Court does not find plain\n\nerror.  Other than the phrase, \"Believe me,\"  which appears to be\n\nan expression of personal  opinion only if read out  of the total\n\ncontext, the  prosecutor's comment does not  improperly vouch for\n\nthe  credibility of  Government  witnesses.

When  read in  context, the  phrase \"it\n\nseems  to  me\"  does not  amount  to  improper  vouching for  the\n\ncredibility  of  a  Government  witness because  the  comment  is\n\nlimited to the terms  of the plea agreement.  \"It is not error to\n\ninform a  jury of  the contents  of a plea  agreement, nor  is it\n\nimproper  for  the government  to  call attention  to  a witness'\n\nmotivation for testifying.\"   United States v.

Appellant's\n\ninterpretation  of comment 3 is far-fetched.  The most this Court\n\ncan glean from the  comment is that (1) the  Government witnesses\n\nwere  motivated  to testify,  at least  in  part, because  of the\n\nprospect of  criminal prosecution and that  (2) their involvement\n\nin the conspiracy, as disclosed by their testimony, when compared\n\nwith the  conduct alleged  against defendants in  the indictment,\n\nindicated that  the witnesses were less  culpable than defendants\n\nin the overall conspiracy.

IV, 18 U.S.C.  App. (\"IAD\"\n\nor  \"Act\").   The  IAD  establishes  procedures for  transfer  of\n\nprisoners  incarcerated  in  one  jurisdiction  to the  temporary\n\ncustody  of  another  jurisdiction  where  criminal  charges  are\n\npending.  It\n\nsets  time  limits for  trying  prisoners  transferred under  its\n\nprovisions, with the purpose  of encouraging the \"expeditious and\n\norderly disposition\" of outstanding charges. IAD, Art. I.  \n\n          Kenney  argues  that the  indictment  should  have been\n\ndismissed based on the following violations of the IAD:\n\n            Violation of Art.  IV(a), which  provides\n                                    \n            for a thirty-day period \"after receipt by\n            the  appropriate  authorities before  the\n            request   [for   temporary  custody]   be\n            honored, within which period the Governor\n            of the sending  State may disapprove  the\n            request   for    temporary   custody   or\n            availability, either upon his  own motion\n            or upon motion of the prisoner\";\n\n                               -44-\n\n            Violation of Art. IV(d),  which indicates\n                                   \n            that the Act does not deprive a  prisoner\n            of any  right to contest the  legality of\n            his extradition to the receiving state;\n\n            Violation of Art.  IV(c), which  provides\n                                    \n            that \"trial shall be commenced within one\n            hundred and twenty days of the arrival of\n            the prisoner in the receiving  State, but\n            for good  cause shown in open  court, the\n            prisoner  or  his counsel  being present,\n            the  court  having  jurisdiction  of  the\n            matter   may   grant  any   necessary  or\n            reasonable continuance.\"\n\nKenney  failed to raise  Articles IV(a) and IV(d)  as a basis for\n\nhis motion to dismiss below; hence, he has waived those arguments\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim P.  12(b) and 12(f).  We have considered\n\nwhether these  claims constitute  plain error and  have concluded\n\nthat they do not.\n\n          Kenney did raise  Art. IV(c) on several  occasions as a\n\nbasis for  objecting to  motions  for continuances  filed by  co-\n\ndefendants and ultimately in a  motion to dismiss his indictment,\n\narguing that the  court failed to try him within  120 days of his\n\nappearance  in the  jurisdiction of  New Hampshire.    Kenney was\n\nbrought to  the District  of New  Hampshire on  May 7, 1992,  and\n\ntrial, pursuant  to a strict application of the 120-day deadline,\n\nshould have commenced on September 8, 1992.25  \n\n          In  denying  Kenney's  motion  to  dismiss,  the  judge\n\nindicated  that continuing  the  trial until  October  5 did  not\n\nviolate the  120-day provision because the clock  had been tolled\n\nfor twenty-eight  days, from  August 4  through August  31, 1992,\n\n                    \n\n25  September 5, 1992,  was exactly 120 days, but that  date fell\non a holiday weekend.\n\n                               -45-\n\nwhile  the magistrate  judge resolved  pretrial motions  filed by\n\nKenney.  The  judge also  ruled that delays  attributable to  the\n\ndisposition of motions  filed by other co-defendants  constituted\n\n\"good  cause\" under  the  IAD and  were  also excluded  from  the\n\ncomputation.\n\n          This Court has recently  suggested that delay caused by\n\na court's resolution of  pending co-defendant motions may qualify\n                                                         \n\nas excludible time under  Article IV(c) of the IAD  which states,\n\n\"for  good cause  shown in  open court . . . the  court . . . may\n\ngrant any necessary or reasonable continuance.\"  Whiting v.

However,\n\nthe facts of  this case allow us to affirm  the court's denial of\n\nKenney's motion to dismiss on a narrower ground; i.e., that delay\n                                                     \n\nattributable  to   the  disposition  of  motions   filed  by  the\n\ndefendant, himself, is excludible from the 120-day computation.\n\n          Art. VI(a) of the  IAD provides that the  120-day clock\n\n\"shall be  tolled whenever and  for as  long as  the prisoner  is\n\nunable to  stand trial.\"   This  Court has  generally interpreted\n\nthis provision to allow for tolling during the time that it takes\n\nfor the  court to resolve matters raised  by the defendant who is\n\nclaiming rights under the IAD.

On  August 4,  he filed\n\nseven  pretrial motions but did not  refer to his reliance on the\n\nIAD  to  notify the  magistrate that  an expedited  decision was,\n\nperhaps, warranted.  The Government submitted responses on August\n\n14, and the magistrate ruled on the motions on August 31.  Kenney\n\ninformed the court that  he was specifically relying on  the 120-\n\nday trial provision on  September 1, when he filed  objections to\n\nmotions by co-defendants seeking a continuance of the trial date.\n\n          In these  circumstances, the Court finds  that a 28-day\n\ndelay in  resolving defendant's own motions  was not unreasonable\n\nand that after excluding this delay, trial was properly commenced\n\nwithin  the  120-day  deadline.26   Accordingly,  we  affirm  the\n\ndistrict  court's  denial  of  Kenney's  motion  to  dismiss  his\n\nindictment.  \n\nB.  The Court's Admission into Evidence of Semi-Automatic Handgun\n                                                                 \n\n          Appellant Kenney challenges the court's  admission into\n\nevidence of  Government exhibit 42, a  .32 caliber semi-automatic\n\nhandgun.  Specifically, Kenney  argues that the Government failed\n\nto  introduce sufficient evidence that  (1) the gun  had not been\n\n                    \n\n26  According to  this Court's calculations, the  120-day period,\nexcluding the twenty-eight-day delay occasioned by defendant, ran\non October  3, 1992, which  was a Saturday.   Trial was  properly\ncommenced on the first day of the business week, October 5, 1992.\n\n                               -47-\n\naltered subsequent to the  crime and (2)  the gun was the  actual\n\ngun used  in the crimes  in question.   We need  not belabor  the\n\npoint because we find that  the district court did not abuse  its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the handgun.\n\n          Federal  Rule of  Evidence  901(a) requires  the  trial\n\ncourt to  determine if there  is a \"reasonable  probability\" that\n\nthe evidence is what it is purported to be.   Evidence before the\n\ncourt indicated  that the  gun had  been stored  in a  garage for\n\nthirteen  days.   Even though the  garage was  used as  a storage\n\nfacility by  several people, testimony at trial  indicated that a\n\nco-conspirator's relative  retrieved  the handgun  from the  same\n\nplace that it had been left by Kenney and Flynn.  Considering the\n\nnature    of   the   handgun,   circumstances   surrounding   its\n\npreservation,  and  the  scant likelihood  of  intermeddlers, the\n\njudge properly determined that  it was in substantially the  same\n\ncondition.\n\n          The  trial court also  did not abuse  its discretion in\n\ndetermining  that there  was  a reasonable  probability that  the\n\nhandgun  was the  same  gun used  in the  robberies.

The co-conspirators took  refuge in\nNeal's home  immediately following the robbery  with a reasonable\ninference from the  testimony being that  Neal opened his  cellar\ndoor to  let them in.  Neal  followed Flynn's instructions to \"go\nout and get the box of money\"  out of the car, with the box  also\ncontaining the gun used in the  robbery.  Tr.

That section of the Guidelines provides for\n\na  four-level  reduction  where   the  court  determines  that  a\n\ndefendant was a minimal  participant in the offense for  which he\n\nwas  convicted and is intended to cover only those defendants who\n\nare  clearly the least culpable of those involved in the criminal\n\nconduct  of the group.

Brum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571450\"><a href=\"/opinion/571450/united-states-v-beverly-brum/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Here,  the   court's  determination  was   not  clearly\n\nerroneous and we affirm.   Neal mistakenly refers to  the overall\n\nconspiracy  encompassing  five  robberies as  the  benchmark  for\n\narguing that he played a minimal role.  But section 3B1.2 focuses\n\non  the role  of a  defendant with respect  to the  offense(s) of\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\nat 40.  Neal was given  between $2000-$5000 as his split from the\nproceeds  of  the  robbery.    Flynn  later  furnished  him  with\nadditional  money from the robbery to pay off hundreds of dollars\nin parking tickets  and to purchase a car in his  name to be used\nby  Flynn  and  Kenney to  drive  to  Arizona  and eventually  to\nCalifornia.  A friend of Neal's testified that he told her he had\nwon the money  used to purchase  the car by  betting on  football\ngames and had purchased  the car with the intention  of letting a\nfriend use it for a week or so.\n\n                               -50-\n\nwhich  he was  convicted.   Here,  Neal  was convicted  of  money\n                        \n\nlaundering and being  an accessory  after the fact.   He was  the\n\nonly  defendant indicted and convicted  on the count  of being an\n\naccessory  after the fact and  was indicted and convicted jointly\n\nwith Flynn on the money laundering  count.  The facts support the\n\ncourt's  determination that Neal did not play a minimal role with\n\nrespect to the conduct alleged in either count.\n\n                         VII.  CONCLUSION\n                                         \n\n          Accordingly,  the Court  affirms  the district  court's\n\nrulings on all issues raised on appeal except the issue raised by\n                                             \n\nAppellant Flynn  regarding the court's denial  of various motions\n\nfor production of witness statements under the Jencks Act and the\n\nissue raised  by Appellant  Neal regarding  the court's order  of\n\nrestitution against  him.  We will  retain appellate jurisdiction\n\nto  enable  us to  review the  augmented  record and  the court's\n\nsubsequent  determinations  on  the Jencks  Act  and  restitution\n\nclaims.\n\n          With respect to Appellant Flynn's challenge,  we remand\n\nthe  case  for  an   evidentiary  hearing  to  determine  whether\n\nstatements  were improperly  withheld  from him  during trial  in\n\nviolation  of the Jencks Act and, if so, whether nondisclosure of\n\nsuch  statements constituted  harmless  error.   With respect  to\n\nAppellant  Neal's challenge, we remand the case so that the court\n\nmay determine  whether the  full amount  of  damages suffered  by\n\nFirst  N.H.  was  caused   by  the  criminal  conduct  underlying\n\nAppellant's  convictions  for  money  laundering  and  being   an\n\n                               -51-\n\naccessory after the fact.   The court should report  its findings\n\nand  determinations back to us within ninety  (90) days.  We will\n\nretain appellate jurisdiction for the time being.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n                          \n\n                               -52-\n\n           APPENDIX I:  LISTING OF JENCKS ACT RULINGS \n                                                     \n                   TO BE RECONSIDERED ON REMAND\n                                               \n\n          Below find  examples where the court  indicated that it\n\nwas denying  Jencks Act requests on the  ground that there was no\n\nshowing  that the  witness had  seen and  adopted the  statements\n\npursuant to 18  U.S.C.   3500 (e)(1).   The court failed to  make\n\nthe  further inquiry,  pursuant to  18 U.S.C.    3500 (e)(2),  of\n\nwhether  the notes  or  interview reports  of government  agents,\n\nrequested    by   counsel,   contained   statements   that   were\n\nsubstantially verbatim recitals  of a witness'  prior statements.\n\nRulings  made pursuant  to  this erroneous  standard include  the\n\nfollowing:  \n\n(1)  After  the Government  conducted direct  examination on\n     Anita Ramsdell,  a teller  at  First N.H.,  Appellant's\n     counsel requested all  Jencks material on the  witness.\n     The court indicated:\n\n          I   looked  at   it  and   it's  not   Jencks\n          material. . . . But I can't really rule on it\n          at  this point  until somebody  asks her  the\n          question if she's ever seen it.\n\n     Tr.   (October  9, 1992)  at 6.    Cross-examination by\n     Appellant's  counsel indicated that  an FBI  agent took\n     notes for a half hour  to forty-five minutes while  the\n     witness was  being questioned  by a detective  from the\n     Stratham  police department  but she  further testified\n     that  she never saw  the notes.   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571450\"><a href=\"/opinion/571450/united-states-v-beverly-brum/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 34-37. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  It is\n                                          \n     presumably on this  basis, that witness Anita  Ramsdell\n     never  saw or adopted the notes,  that the court denied\n     counsel's Jencks request.  \n\n(2)  While   Appellant's   counsel  was   conducting  cross-\n     examination upon Richard Ferguson, a co-conspirator who\n     pled  guilty  and   cooperated  with  the   Government,\n     Ferguson   testified  that   he  met   with  Government\n     attorneys Patrick  Walsh and  Robert Veiga and  someone\n     from the FBI  on at least  two different occasions  and\n     that Walsh  was probably  taking notes.   Counsel asked\n     for a sidebar:\n\n                               -53-\n\n          Counsel:   There  are  four to  six hours  of\n          statements that someone took  notes on. . . .\n          I  would  suggest  that there  must  be  some\n          Jencks material . . . .\n\n          Court:    So  far  I can't  agree  with  you,\n          counsel, but your objection is noted.\n\n     Tr. (October 14, 1992) at 140.\n\n     On further cross-examination  of Ferguson, he testified\n     that  Government  attorney  Walsh  went over  the  same\n     things  with  him in  the  second  interview that  were\n     covered in  the first  interview.  Counsel  again asked\n     for  a  sidebar requesting  that  the  court order  the\n     Government  to  turn  over  materials  from  the  first\n     interview based on the  witness' testimony that he went\n     over these materials with the Government attorney:\n\n          Government:  Your Honor,  it is not.  I  mean\n          all he  said so far is  that -- as I remember\n          his  testimony -- is  that he  went  over the\n          same things in each interview.\n\n          Court:   That is  my  understanding, but  the\n          objection of the defense is noted.\n\n          Counsel:     Your   Honor,  wait   a  minute.\n          Unfortunately I must admit I don't understand\n          what's  going on  here,  but I  am trying  to\n          figure it out.   Am I  to understand that  at\n          some point  is work product  being interposed\n          here  for the basis of why we are not getting\n          these materials? \n          . . . .\n          Counsel:   The reason  is that you  have been\n          given  documents which you have reviewed, and\n          within those  documents somehow he  has never\n          adopted  them,  so that's  why  we don't  get\n          them?\n\n          Court:  The  record before me is that  he has\n          never adopted those documents.\n           . . . . \n          Court:   If I  am wrong  I will  be reversed.\n          Your objection is noted.\n          . . . .\n          Counsel:   I want the record  to reflect that\n          in my  opinion what I now  understand is that\n          this  is a  very clever  manipulation of  the\n          rules by the United States Government in  the\n          District  of  New  Hampshire  to  avoid  ever\n\n                               -54-\n\n          giving Jencks material, because what we do is\n          if we never ask the witness to adopt it, that\n          if there is no  steno present, we can clearly\n          say there is not Jencks material . . . .\n\n     Tr.  (October 14, 1992) at 152-53.\n\n(3)  The  court  denied  production of  Jencks  material  on\n     witness  Linda Sherouse  who worked  at the  Dress Barn\n     retail store and was victim of a night deposit robbery.\n     When Sherouse was testifying on direct examination with\n     respect to  the gun used  by the robber,  counsel asked\n     for a side bar:\n\n          Counsel:   Now  I'd  like to  know where  her\n          Jencks  material is.  Where's her statements?\n          Where's  a description  of this?   Where's  a\n          prior statement  of this  or  why hasn't  she\n          been shown this?\n\n          Government:  She gave a statement at the time\n          of  the  incident to  the  local authorities,\n          which was Hampton  Police Department I guess.\n          But there  has been  no Jencks  material with\n          respect to that.\n          . . . .\n          Court:  Why don't  you give him the statement\n          she made to the Hampton cops.\n\n          Government:   She  hasn't  reviewed it.   She\n          hasn't reviewed it.  It's not Jencks.\n\n          Court:  Can I review it?\n\n          Government:  Sure, certainly.\n          . . . .\n          Court:  For the  record, I have reviewed them\n          and I  don't think  there's either  Jencks or\n          Brady material in them.\n\n     Tr.  (October 27, 1992 -- Afternoon session) at 86-88.\n\n(4)  Other  examples  where  the  court  may  have  used  an\n     erroneous  legal  ground  in  denying  Jencks  requests\n     include  a  request  for  Jencks  material  on  Douglas\n     Scamman.   Scamman  is  a dairy  farmer who  identified\n     Appellant  Flynn in court as one of several men whom he\n     observed on  various occasions  loitering near a  field\n     that was allegedly used  by the armed robbers  to reach\n     and  escape from First N.H.  Counsel asked the court to\n     order  production  of  Jencks  or  Brady  material with\n     respect  to statements  made by  Scamman that  might be\n\n                               -55-\n\n     included in a report  filed by a Sergeant Forbes.   The\n     court denied  the request.   Tr. (October 19,  1992) at\n     171-73.  \n\n     The  court  also  denied   a  Jencks  Act  request  for\n     statements made  by  co-conspirator Arthur  Cosgro  who\n     cooperated with the Government.  Counsel indicated that\n     he had been given no materials that would shed light on\n     testimony  by  Cosgro  with  respect  to  a  particular\n     conversation that he had with Appellant Flynn.  Counsel\n     questioned  whether the  basis of the  statement should\n     have been  disclosed in  his Jencks  Act request.   Tr.\n     (October 20, 1992) at 73-77.\n\n     The  court   denied  Jencks   Act  requests   on  prior\n     statements contained in reports of interviews with  co-\n     conspirators Thomas  McQueeney and Brian  Raineri, both\n     of whom cooperated with the Government.   It is unclear\n     whether  an erroneous  legal ground  was used  in these\n     denials.    Tr.
