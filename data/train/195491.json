FACTS\n                                     \n\n     On July 17, 1993,  Appellant Mae Linh Pelkey pled  guilty in\n\nUnited  States  District Court  in Concord,  New Hampshire,  to a\n\ncriminal information  charging three  counts  of mail  fraud,  18\n\nU.S.C.   1341, and one count of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C.   1343.  \n\nPelkey defrauded a  number of her  friends, business  associates,\n\nand former customers out  of more than $500,000.   The fraudulent\n\ntransactions involved real estate, investments, and the sale of a\n\nJaguar automobile.    \n\n     The Presentence Report recommended an adjusted total offense\n\nlevel for  Pelkey of 16.1   The trial  court adopted most  of the\n\nfindings and  recommendations of  the  Presentence Report,2  with\n\n                    \n1The  recommended total adjusted offense  level of 16 included: a\nbase offense level of six for fraud, U.S.S.G.   2F1.1; plus  nine\nlevels for the  loss involved  in the offense  of conviction  and\nrelevant   conduct,  totalling  between  $350,000  and  $500,000,\nU.S.S.G.    2F1.1(b)(1);  plus a  two-level enhancement  for more\nthan one  victim, U.S.S.G.     2F1.1(b)(2)(B); plus  a  two-level\nenhancement for  vulnerable victim, U.S.S.G.    3A1.1; less three\nlevels for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G.   3E1.1(a)  and\n(b).\n\n2The court disagreed with the report in two respects.  First, the\ncourt  found the total amount of loss was $576,290.40 rather than\n$364,264.47.  The effect of this determination on the  adjustment\n\n                               -2-\n\nthe resulting sentencing  range of 24 to 30 months.  U.S.S.G. Ch.\n\n5, Pt. A (sentencing table).  In addition, the Presentence Report\n\nnoted that the psychological injury of the victims may be grounds\n\nfor upward adjustment under U.S.S.G.   5K2.3.  The Government, in\n\nturn,  requested  an  upward  departure  based  on  the  \"extreme\n\npsychological injury\" suffered by Pelkey's victims.  \n\n     The  sentencing  transcript  reveals  the  district  court's\n\nstruggle  over whether and how much to depart from the Guidelines\n\nin this case.   In an effort to quantify the  \"real value\" of the\n\nloss suffered by  the victims, the court relied on  the table set\n\nforth at section 2F1.1 of the Guidelines.  Finding the real value\n\nof  the loss  to  these victims  closer  to $10,000,000  than  to\n\n$500,000,  the approximate  monetary loss  used to  determine the\n\nbase  offense level, the court concluded that an upward departure\n\nof five  levels, from level 17  to level 22, was  warranted.  The\n\ncourt then imposed a sentence of 43 months of imprisonment, to be\n\nserved  concurrently with  the unexpired  term of  Pelkey's state\n\nsentence on related fraud charges, and restitution. \n\n                    \nfor the specific offense characteristics was that the  adjustment\nwould be plus ten rather than plus nine, thus raising Pelkey to a\ntotal  adjusted offense level of 17.   Next, the court found that\nthe sentences  described in the  criminal history section  of the\nPresentence Report,  giving rise to the  state court convictions,\nwere  sentences  for  conduct  that  was  \"part  of  the  instant\noffense.\"   As  a  result, the  court  found that  Pelkey  should\nreceive no criminal history points, changing her criminal history\ncategory  from II  to  I.   The Court  notes,  however, that  the\nrecalculation  of Pelkey's  offense characteristics  and criminal\nhistory  category did not  change the sentencing  range from that\nrecommended in the Presentence Report. \n\n                               -3-\n\n                          II. DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\n     Pelkey contends  that the  trial  court's application  of  a\n\nfive-level upward  adjustment  in  the  base  offense  level  was\n\nexcessive and unreasonable.  Specifically, Pelkey argues that  it\n\nwas error  for the  court to  assess the real  value of  the harm\n\nexperienced  by the victims at a factor twenty times greater than\n\ntheir actual  monetary  losses.    Although  Pelkey  admits  that\n\nconsideration of the victims' psychological injury is permissible\n\nunder U.S.S.G.   5K2.3, she argues that the alleged injury to the\n\nvictims  in  this  case is  not  serious  enough  to support  the\n\napplication of  that section.   The Government responds  that the\n\ncourt principally found  support for  the departure  in the  fact\n\nthat  the guideline sentence did  not fully account  for the harm\n\ndone to the victims because of their loss of retirement funds and\n\nsome of the victims'  inability to recapture the loss  because of\n\ntheir ages.  In  the alternative, the Government argues  that the\n\ncourt  found sufficient facts to support  a departure pursuant to\n\nsection 5K2.3 for extreme psychological injury.     \n\n     The district court offered two reasons that section  2F1.1's\n\nloss table  did not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness\n\nof   the  conduct:  1)  for  some  of  the  victims,  the  losses\n\nrepresented \"all or  partially all of their  life savings. .  . .\n\nand the ability of these victims to  recover from the losses they\n\nsuffered is quite limited\"; and 2) several victims have  suffered\n\n                               -4-\n\n\"extreme psychological  injury as  a  result of  the  defendant's\n\nconduct.\"3  Supplemental Findings of Fact and  Conclusions of Law\n\n                    \n3The district court explained its reasons for departure both from\nthe  bench  and  in written  Supplemental  Findings  of Fact  and\nConclusions of Law.   We quote these findings and  conclusions at\nlength in order to show a complete understanding of the basis for\nthe district court's decision.  \n\n     I  have departed  upwards in  sentencing the  defendant\n     from a level 17 to a level 22 because I have determined\n     that aggravating circumstances exist in this case of  a\n     kind  and   degree  not  taken  into   account  by  the\n     Sentencing Commission.   As  a  result of  this  upward\n     departure, I have sentenced the defendant to 43 months.\n     I have departed upwards for the following reasons:\n\n          (a)  Application Note 10 to Section 2F1.1  of\n          the Sentencing Guidelines provides that \"[i]n\n          cases  in which  the  loss  determined  under\n          subsection (b)(1) does  not fully capture the\n          harmfulness and seriousness  of the  conduct,\n          an  upward departure  may  be warranted.\"   I\n          have  relied  upon  this note  in  making  an\n          upward departure.\n\n          (b)  The primary reason  why the loss in this\n          case  does not represent  the seriousness and\n          harmfulness  of  the  defendant's conduct  is\n          that the  losses suffered by  several of  the\n          victims  represented all or  partially all of\n          their  life savings.    Further,  in  several\n          cases,  the victims  were elderly  or nearing\n          retirement  and the ability  of these victims\n          to  recover from the  losses they suffered is\n          quite limited.   Thus,  the losses  here will\n          require several  of the victims  to live  out\n          their    lives    under   severe    financial\n          constraints  that  they  would not  otherwise\n          have had  to suffer if the  defendant had not\n          engaged in her criminal  conduct.  Given  the\n          defendant's close friendship with  several of\n          these  elderly victims,  it is  reasonable to\n          conclude  that she  was  or should  have been\n          aware  that  her   course  of  conduct  would\n          deprive these victims of all or most of their\n          retirement savings.   This is a factor  which\n\n                               -5-\n\nat  4 and  5.    This  Court  reviews  sentencing  departures  by\n\nexamining: (1) whether the reasons  the court gave for  departing\n\nare of the  sort that might permit a  departure in an appropriate\n\ncase;  (2)  whether  the record  supports  the  finding of  facts\n\ndemonstrating  the existence  of such  reasons; and  (3) whether,\n\ngiven the reasons, the degree of departure is reasonable.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.  Rivera, 994  F.2d 942,  950  (1st Cir.  1993); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Diaz-Villafane,  874  F.2d 43,  49  (1st Cir.),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 493  U.S. 862 (1989).  In Rivera, we refined the standard\n                                        \n\nof  review for departures under  the first prong, finding plenary\n\nreview  appropriate  to determine  whether the  allegedly special\n\n                    \n          the  Guidelines  could   not  possibly   have\n          considered  in  measuring  the offense  level\n          that  should be  assigned to  the defendant's\n          conduct.\n\n          (c)  A secondary reason for the departure  is\n          that  there  is  evidence  reflected  in  the\n          Presentence Report that several  victims have\n          suffered  extreme  psychological injury  as a\n          result of the defendant's conduct.  Moreover,\n          given  the  defendant's  exploitation of  her\n          close friendship with several of the victims,\n          it is reasonable  to assume that  she was  or\n          should have been aware of the risk of extreme\n          psychological injury that  could result  from\n          her  conduct.    While  it  could  be debated\n          whether  the psychological  injuries suffered\n          by the  victims in this case are so severe as\n          to qualify for departure under   5K2.3 of the\n          Guidelines,  I  find  that the  psychological\n          injuries suffered here,  in combination  with\n          the  other  reasons  I  have  expressed,  are\n          serious   enough   to   warrant   an   upward\n          departure.\n\nSupplemental Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 4-5. \n\n                               -6-\n\ncircumstances underlying the  departure \"are of a 'kind' that the\n\nSentencing Guidelines, in principle,  permit the sentencing court\n                                   \n\nto consider.\"   Rivera, 994 F.2d at 951.   Plenary review is also\n                      \n\napplied to interpretations of Guideline language.   Id.  However,\n                                                       \n\nwe review  the  district court's  determination  that a  case  is\n\nunusual, and therefore worthy of departure, \"with full  awareness\n\nof, and respect for,  the trier's superior 'feel' for  the case.\"\n\nId. at 952 (quoting  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 50).   Similarly\n                                   \n\ndeferential  is our review of  the second and  third prongs, that\n\nis, the sentencing court's findings of fact and the direction and\n\ndegree of departure, respectively.  Id. at 950.  \n                                       \n\n     The  sentencing   judge  is  not  required   to  ignore  the\n\nconsequences  of a  fraud scheme  outside the  immediate monetary\n\nloss.  If  the evidence  shows that the  defendant's offense  was\n\nmore serious than contemplated by the applicable guidelines,  the\n\njudge  can  depart  upward.    See  18  U.S.C.    3553(b)(general\n                                  \n\nprinciple); U.S.S.G.    2F1.1, comment (n.10).   Application Note\n\n10  provides a nonexclusive list of  circumstances where the loss\n\ndetermined in  section 2F1.1(b)(1)  does  not fully  capture  the\n\nharmfulness of the conduct and, thus, departure may be warranted.\n\n     In this  case, we begin by  noting that the amount  of money\n\nand  the number  of victims  had already  been factored  into the\n\ncalculation of Pelkey's base offense level under the  Guidelines.\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(1)  and (b)(2)(B).  In  addition, the special\n\nvulnerability  resulting from  the age of  the victims  and their\n\n                               -7-\n\nrelationship with the Defendant had also been taken into account.\n\nU.S.S.G.      3A1.1.   Accordingly,  if we  are to  avoid double-\n\ncounting in this case, the departure  can be valid only if it was\n\nproperly based  on the  victims'  resulting financial  strain  or\n\npsychological harm.  We will deal with each issue in turn.\n\n                  A. Financial Strain of Victims\n                                                \n\n     The  principal  reason  given  by  the  district  court  for\n\ndeparture was the  victims' limited ability  to recover from  the\n\nloss of accumulated  savings and the  resulting financial  stress\n\nassociated with the  loss of life savings.  This presents for our\n\ndetermination the issue of  whether these facts are  unusual and,\n\ntherefore, worthy of departure.  Accordingly, we will \"accept the\n\nfindings  of fact of the  district court unless  they are clearly\n\nerroneous\" and  will \"give due deference to  the district court's\n\napplication  of  the  guidelines to  the  facts.\"    18 U.S.C.   \n\n3742(e).  \n\n     Robert  and  Kim  Atma's  financial  loss represented  their\n\naccumulated life savings of more than 20 years.  Already retired,\n\nKatherine Meuse and  Julie Laskey, now  without their  retirement\n\nsavings, are forced to live on social security and to borrow from\n\nfriends and relatives.  In addition, Ms. Meuse has been forced to\n\nforego  physical  examinations  and   medication  for  her  heart\n\nproblem.    Pelkey's  scheme  left  Robert  LeClair  \"financially\n\n                               -8-\n\ndepleted.\"   Mr. LeClair was forced to  go back to work full time\n\nat age 60, his automobile has been repossessed, and he was forced\n\nto take out a home equity loan.    \n\n     The  nonexclusive  list  of  grounds   for  departure  under\n\nApplication Note 10 of section 2F1.1 does not include the reasons\n\ngiven by the district court for departure.  The failure to have a\n\nsecure financial future does not, without more, rise to the level\n\nof seriousness contemplated  by the other  grounds for  departure\n\nsuggested  in the  application  note.4   The bases  for departure\n\nprovided in Application Note 10 all suggest unusual repercussions\n\nbeyond  the loss of financial  capacity and the  general sense of\n\nbetrayal   normally  associated   with   fraud  involving   false\n\npretenses.     We acknowledge that there is a distinction between\n\ndefrauding a 40-year-old of her life savings and defrauding a 60-\n\n                    \n4Examples  of  fraud  of a  more  serious  caliber  given in  the\nApplication Note are:\n\n     (a)  the primary objective of the fraud was non-\n     monetary;\n\n     (b)   false  statements were  made for  the  purpose of\n          facilitating some other crime;\n\n     (c)  the offense caused physical or psychological harm;\n\n     (d)  the offense endangered national security or \n     military readiness;\n\n     (e)   the  offense caused  a loss  of confidence  in an\n          important institution.\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1, comment (n.10).\n\n                               -9-\n\nyear-old of her savings;  that is, the 40-year-old is  capable of\n\nrecouping  at least some of  the loss, while  the 60-year-old may\n\nhave little or no opportunity to recover from the financial loss.\n\nThis  distinction  is,  at  least  partially,  reflected  in  the\n\nenhancement for  vulnerable victims  and, in any  case, does  not\n\nwarrant a five-level departure.  Therefore, the upward  departure\n\nin  this case must be vacated.    On remand, if the court were to\n\nmake  specific findings that some  of the victims  were unable to\n\nprovide for their welfare  or that the facts present  a situation\n\nequal to the  serious caliber  of the other  basis suggested  for\n\ndeparture in Application Note 10, departure may be appropriate.5\n\n                B. Psychological Injury to Victims\n                                                  \n\n     The district  court  also gave  as  a secondary  reason  for\n\ndeparture  the victims  psychological injuries.    \"[P]hysical or\n\npsychological harm\" to the victim is specifically mentioned under\n\nApplication Note 10(c)  as a  possible basis for  departure.   An\n\nupward departure grounded on psychological  injury is appropriate\n\nonly when the  injury is  \"much more serious  than that  normally\n\nresulting from commission of the offense,\" U.S.S.G.    5K2.3, and\n\n                    \n5The  Court notes that Application Note 10 has since been amended\nto  provide  that departure  may be  appropriate if  \"the offense\ninvolved  the knowing endangerment of the solvency of one or more\nvictims.\"   U.S.S.G   2F1.1, comment (n.10(f))(1993).  This seems\nto address the type of harm the court was attempting to quantify.\nA departure based on these grounds requires  a court to find that\na defendant  knowingly pushed  a  victim into  extreme  financial\n                      \nhardship.  \n\n                               -10-\n\nonly when there is a \"substantial impairment of the intellectual,\n\npsychological, emotional, or behavioral  functioning of a victim,\n\nwhen the impairment is likely to be of an extended or  continuous\n\nduration, and when the impairment manifests itself by physical or\n\npsychological symptoms or by changes in behavior patterns.\"  Id.;\n                                                                \n\nUnited  States  v.   Astorri,  923  F.2d  1052,   1059  (3d  Cir.\n                            \n\n1991)(court  upheld  two-level departure  for  psychological harm\n\nwhere  evidence showed  that a  victim suffered  from high  blood\n\npressure and was under a doctor's care as a result of defendant's\n\nactions).\n\n   The  evidence, in this  case, of  psychological injury  to the\n\nvictims was, at best, meager.   All of the victims expressed  the\n\nfeeling  that they  had  lost trust  in  their ability  to  judge\n\nothers.   In  addition, the  record reveals  that the  Atmas, who\n\nconsidered themselves \"best friends\" of Pelkey for over 22 years,\n\nsuffered a sense of severe shock after learning of the fraudulent\n\nreal  estate  scheme.6   Ms. Meuse  and  Ms. Laskey,  friends and\n\nformer clients  of Pelkey, told  the probation officer  that they\n\nexperienced pain, frustration, and depression over  the knowledge\n\nthat  they will  not  live their  senior  years without  fear  of\n\nfinancial burden.  Sean Tracey told the Probation Officer that he\n\n                    \n6Robert Atma's  victim impact  statement also  references \"mental\nanguish   and   heartache\"   resulting   from   the   unexplained\ngeographical  separation  from  his  wife.    Assuming  that  the\nseparation  is attributable  to Pelkey's conduct,  these feelings\nare not serious enough to establish a psychic injury.\n\n                               -11-\n\nsuffered lingering feelings of distrust for others as a result of\n\nthe  offense.  The  victim experiencing  the most  severe psychic\n\nharm  appears  to  be  Mr.  LeClair,  Pelkey's  former   business\n\nassociate.  Mr. LeClair  disclosed to the probation  officer that\n\nhe was in an \"emotionally drained state,\" experiencing moments of\n\nextreme  despair  and  thoughts  of   suicide.    No  medical  or\n\npsychological records were offered and there is no evidence  that\n\ntreatment was received by any of the victims.   \n\n     This evidence is altogether insufficient to permit departure\n\nfor psychological injury.  We do  not think that feelings of lack\n\nof trust, frustration, shock, and depression suffered by Pelkey's\n\nvictims are so far beyond the  heartland of fraud offenses as  to\n\nconstitute psychological harm  within the meaning  of the  Policy\n\nStatement in   5K2.3 or Application Note 10(c) to   2F1.1; United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

Some  degree of consequential  trust\n\nand reliance by the victim  is to be expected in the  majority of\n\nfraud  cases involving false pretenses, and  the presence of such\n\nreliance  will  not generally  justify  departure.   In  sum, the\n\ninjuries  these people suffered were  no worse than  that of many\n        \n\nfraud victims.       \n\n     The  sentence  is  vacated  and  the case  is  remanded  for\n\nresentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\n                               -12-\n",

FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 1993, Appellant Mae Linh Pelkey pled guilty in United States District Court in Concord, New Hampshire, to a criminal information charging three counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, and one count of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343.  Pelkey defrauded a number of her friends, business associates, and former customers out of more than $500,000.  The fraudulent transactions involved real estate, investments, and the sale of a Jaguar automobile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Presentence Report recommended an adjusted total offense level for Pelkey of 16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The trial court adopted most of the findings and recommendations of the Presentence Report,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with the resulting sentencing range of 24 to 30 months.  U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).  In addition, the Presentence Report noted that the psychological injury of the victims may be grounds for upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.3.  The Government, in turn, requested an upward departure based on the \"extreme psychological injury\" suffered by Pelkey's victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing transcript reveals the district court's struggle over whether and how much to depart from the Guidelines in this case.  In an effort to quantify the \"real value\" of the loss suffered by the victims, the court relied on the table set forth at section 2F1.1 of the Guidelines.  Finding the real value of the loss to these victims closer to $10,000,000 than to $500,000, the approximate monetary loss used to determine the base offense level, the court concluded that an upward departure of five levels, from level 17 to level 22, was warranted.  The court then imposed a sentence of 43 months of imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the unexpired term of Pelkey's state sentence on related fraud charges, and restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pelkey contends that the trial court's application of a five-level upward adjustment in the base offense level was excessive and unreasonable.  Specifically, Pelkey argues that it was error for the court to assess the real value of the harm experienced by the victims at a factor twenty times greater than their actual monetary losses.  Although Pelkey admits that consideration of the victims' psychological injury is permissible under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.3, she argues that the alleged injury to the victims in this case is not serious enough to support the application of that section.  The Government responds that the court principally found support for the departure in the fact that the guideline sentence did not fully account for the harm done to the victims because of their loss of retirement funds and some of the victims' inability to recapture the loss because of their ages.  In the alternative, the Government argues that the court found sufficient facts to support a departure pursuant to section 5K2.3 for extreme psychological injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court offered two reasons that section 2F1.1's loss table did not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct:  1) for some of the victims, the losses represented \"all or partially all of their life savings.... and the ability of these victims to recover from the losses they suffered is quite limited\";  and 2) several victims have suffered \"extreme psychological injury as a result of the defendant's conduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Supplemental Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 4 and 5.  This Court reviews sentencing departures by examining:  (1) whether the reasons the court gave for departing are of the sort that might permit a departure in an appropriate case;  (2) whether the record supports the finding of facts demonstrating the existence of such reasons;  and (3) whether, given the reasons, the degree of departure is reasonable.  United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 950 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989).  In Rivera, we refined the standard of review for departures under the first prong, finding plenary review appropriate to determine whether the allegedly special circumstances underlying the departure \"are of a 'kind' that the Sentencing Guidelines, in principle, permit the sentencing court to consider.\"  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 951.   Plenary review is also applied to interpretations of Guideline language.  Id.  However, we review the district court's determination that a case is unusual, and therefore worthy of departure, \"with full awareness of, and respect for, the trier's superior 'feel' for the case.\"  Id. at 952 (quoting Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 50).   Similarly deferential is our review of the second and third prongs, that is, the sentencing court's findings of fact and the direction and degree of departure, respectively.  Id., 994 F.2d at 950.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge is not required to ignore the consequences of a fraud scheme outside the immediate monetary loss.  If the evidence shows that the defendant's offense was more serious than contemplated by the applicable guidelines, the judge can depart upward.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b) (general principle);  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment (n. 10).  Application Note 10 provides a nonexclusive list of circumstances where the loss determined in section 2F1.1(b)(1) does not fully capture the harmfulness of the conduct and, thus, departure may be warranted.  In this case, we begin by noting that the amount of money and the number of victims had already been factored into the calculation of Pelkey's base offense level under the Guidelines.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1) and (b)(2)(B).  In addition, the special vulnerability resulting from the age of the victims and their relationship with the Defendant had also been taken into account.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3A1.1.  Accordingly, if we are to avoid double-counting in this case, the departure can be valid only if it was properly based on the victims' resulting financial strain or psychological harm.  We will deal with each issue in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Financial Strain of Victims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal reason given by the district court for departure was the victims' limited ability to recover from the loss of accumulated savings and the resulting financial stress associated with the loss of life savings.  This presents for our determination the issue of whether these facts are unusual and, therefore, worthy of departure.  Accordingly, we will \"accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous\" and will \"give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert and Kim Atma's financial loss represented their accumulated life savings of more than 20 years.  Already retired, Katherine Meuse and Julie Laskey, now without their retirement savings, are forced to live on social security and to borrow from friends and relatives.  In addition, Ms. Meuse has been forced to forego physical examinations and medication for her heart problem.  Pelkey's scheme left Robert LeClair \"financially depleted.\"   Mr. LeClair was forced to go back to work full time at age 60, his automobile has been repossessed, and he was forced to take out a home equity loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nonexclusive list of grounds for departure under Application Note 10 of section 2F1.1 does not include the reasons given by the district court for departure.  The failure to have a secure financial future does not, without more, rise to the level of seriousness contemplated by the other grounds for departure suggested in the application note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The bases for departure provided in Application Note 10 all suggest unusual repercussions beyond the loss of financial capacity and the general sense of betrayal normally associated with fraud involving false pretenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that there is a distinction between defrauding a 40-year-old of her life savings and defrauding a 60-year-old of her savings;  that is, the 40-year-old is capable of recouping at least some of the loss, while the 60-year-old may have little or no opportunity to recover from the financial loss.  This distinction is, at least partially, reflected in the enhancement for vulnerable victims and, in any case, does not warrant a five-level departure.  Therefore, the upward departure in this case must be vacated.  On remand, if the court were to make specific findings that some of the victims were unable to provide for their welfare or that the facts present a situation equal to the serious caliber of the other basis suggested for departure in Application Note 10, departure may be appropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Psychological Injury to Victims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also gave as a secondary reason for departure the victims' psychological injuries.  \"[P]hysical or psychological harm\" to the victim is specifically mentioned under Application Note 10(c) as a possible basis for departure.  An upward departure grounded on psychological injury is appropriate only when the injury is \"much more serious than that normally resulting from commission of the offense,\" U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.3, and only when there is a \"substantial impairment of the intellectual, psychological, emotional, or behavioral functioning of a victim, when the impairment is likely to be of an extended or continuous duration, and when the impairment manifests itself by physical or psychological symptoms or by changes in behavior patterns.\"   Id.; United States v. Astorri, 923 F.2d 1052, 1059 (3d Cir.1991) (court upheld two-level departure for psychological harm where evidence showed that a victim suffered from high blood pressure and was under a doctor's care as a result of defendant's actions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, in this case, of psychological injury to the victims was, at best, meager.  All of the victims expressed the feeling that they had lost trust in their ability to judge others.  In addition, the record reveals that the Atmas, who considered themselves \"best friends\" of Pelkey for over 22 years, suffered a sense of severe shock after learning of the fraudulent real estate scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Ms. Meuse and Ms. Laskey, friends and former clients of Pelkey, told the probation officer that they experienced pain, frustration, and depression over the knowledge that they will not live their senior years without fear of financial burden.  Sean Tracey told the Probation Officer that he suffered lingering feelings of distrust for others as a result of the offense.  The victim experiencing the most severe psychic harm appears to be Mr. LeClair, Pelkey's former business associate.  Mr. LeClair disclosed to the probation officer that he was in an \"emotionally drained state,\" experiencing moments of extreme despair and thoughts of suicide.  No medical or psychological records were offered and there is no evidence that treatment was received by any of the victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence is altogether insufficient to permit departure for psychological injury.  We do not think that feelings of lack of trust, frustration, shock, and depression suffered by Pelkey's victims are so far beyond the heartland of fraud offenses as to constitute psychological harm within the meaning of the Policy Statement in Sec. 5K2.3 or Application Note 10(c) to Sec. 2F1.1;  United States v. Lara, 975 F.2d 1120, 1128 (5th Cir.1992) (finding inadequate proof of harm).  Some degree of consequential trust and reliance by the victim is to be expected in the majority of fraud cases involving false pretenses, and the presence of such reliance will not generally justify departure.  In sum, the injuries these people suffered were no worse than that of many fraud victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The recommended total adjusted offense level of 16 included:  a base offense level of six for fraud, U.S.S.G.

Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1);  plus a two-level enhancement for more than one victim, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2)(B);  plus a two-level enhancement for vulnerable victim, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3A1.1;  less three levels for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a) and (b)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court disagreed with the report in two respects.  First, the court found the total amount of loss was $576,290.40 rather than $364,264.47.  The effect of this determination on the adjustment for the specific offense characteristics was that the adjustment would be plus ten rather than plus nine, thus raising Pelkey to a total adjusted offense level of 17.  Next, the court found that the sentences described in the criminal history section of the Presentence Report, giving rise to the state court convictions, were sentences for conduct that was \"part of the instant offense.\"   As a result, the court found that Pelkey should receive no criminal history points, changing her criminal history category from II to I.  The Court notes, however, that the recalculation of Pelkey's offense characteristics and criminal history category did not change the sentencing range from that recommended in the Presentence Report</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court explained its reasons for departure both from the bench and in written Supplemental Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  We quote these findings and conclusions at length in order to show a complete understanding of the basis for the district court's decision</p>\n        <p>I have departed upwards in sentencing the defendant from a level 17 to a level 22 because I have determined that aggravating circumstances exist in this case of a kind and degree not taken into account by the Sentencing Commission.  As a result of this upward departure, I have sentenced the defendant to 43 months.  I have departed upwards for the following reasons:</p>\n        <p>(a) Application Note 10 to Section 2F1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that \"[i]n cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted.\"   I have relied upon this note in making an upward departure.</p>\n        <p>(b) The primary reason why the loss in this case does not represent the seriousness and harmfulness of the defendant's conduct is that the losses suffered by several of the victims represented all or partially all of their life savings.  Further, in several cases, the victims were elderly or nearing retirement and the ability of these victims to recover from the losses they suffered is quite limited.  Thus, the losses here will require several of the victims to live out their lives under severe financial constraints that they would not otherwise have had to suffer if the defendant had not engaged in her criminal conduct.  Given the defendant's close friendship with several of these elderly victims, it is reasonable to conclude that she was or should have been aware that her course of conduct would deprive these victims of all or most of their retirement savings.  This is a factor which the Guidelines could not possibly have considered in measuring the offense level that should be assigned to the defendant's conduct.</p>\n        <p>(c) A secondary reason for the departure is that there is evidence reflected in the Presentence Report that several victims have suffered extreme psychological injury as a result of the defendant's conduct.  Moreover, given the defendant's exploitation of her close friendship with several of the victims, it is reasonable to assume that she was or should have been aware of the risk of extreme psychological injury that could result from her conduct.  While it could be debated whether the psychological injuries suffered by the victims in this case are so severe as to qualify for departure under Sec. 5K2.3 of the Guidelines, I find that the psychological injuries suffered here, in combination with the other reasons I have expressed, are serious enough to warrant an upward departure.</p>\n        <p>Supplemental Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 4-5.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Examples of fraud of a more serious caliber given in the Application Note are:</p>\n        <p>(a) the primary objective of the fraud was non-monetary;</p>\n        <p>(b) false statements were made for the purpose of facilitating some other crime;</p>\n        <p>(c) the offense caused physical or psychological harm;</p>\n        <p>(d) the offense endangered national security or military readiness;</p>\n        <p>(e) the offense caused a loss of confidence in an important institution.</p>\n        <p>U.S.S.G.

Sec. 2F1.1, comment (n. 10(f)) (1993).  This seems to address the type of harm the court was attempting to quantify.

After considering Defendant's argument, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 1993, Appellant Mae Linh Pelkey pled guilty in United States District Court in Concord, New Hampshire, to a criminal information charging three counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, and one count of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343.  Pelkey defrauded a number of her friends, business associates, and former customers out of more than $500,000.  The fraudulent transactions involved real estate, investments, and the sale of a Jaguar automobile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Presentence Report recommended an adjusted total offense level for Pelkey of 16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The trial court adopted most of the findings and recommendations of the Presentence Report,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with the resulting sentencing range of 24 to 30 months.  U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).  In addition, the Presentence Report noted that the psychological injury of the victims may be grounds for upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.3.  The Government, in turn, requested an upward departure based on the \"extreme psychological injury\" suffered by Pelkey's victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing transcript reveals the district court's struggle over whether and how much to depart from the Guidelines in this case.  In an effort to quantify the \"real value\" of the loss suffered by the victims, the court relied on the table set forth at section 2F1.1 of the Guidelines.  Finding the real value of the loss to these victims closer to $10,000,000 than to $500,000, the approximate monetary loss used to determine the base offense level, the court concluded that an upward departure of five levels, from level 17 to level 22, was warranted.  The court then imposed a sentence of 43 months of imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the unexpired term of Pelkey's state sentence on related fraud charges, and restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pelkey contends that the trial court's application of a five-level upward adjustment in the base offense level was excessive and unreasonable.  Specifically, Pelkey argues that it was error for the court to assess the real value of the harm experienced by the victims at a factor twenty times greater than their actual monetary losses.  Although Pelkey admits that consideration of the victims' psychological injury is permissible under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.3, she argues that the alleged injury to the victims in this case is not serious enough to support the application of that section.  The Government responds that the court principally found support for the departure in the fact that the guideline sentence did not fully account for the harm done to the victims because of their loss of retirement funds and some of the victims' inability to recapture the loss because of their ages.  In the alternative, the Government argues that the court found sufficient facts to support a departure pursuant to section 5K2.3 for extreme psychological injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court offered two reasons that section 2F1.1's loss table did not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct:  1) for some of the victims, the losses represented \"all or partially all of their life savings.... and the ability of these victims to recover from the losses they suffered is quite limited\";  and 2) several victims have suffered \"extreme psychological injury as a result of the defendant's conduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Supplemental Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 4 and 5.  This Court reviews sentencing departures by examining:  (1) whether the reasons the court gave for departing are of the sort that might permit a departure in an appropriate case;  (2) whether the record supports the finding of facts demonstrating the existence of such reasons;  and (3) whether, given the reasons, the degree of departure is reasonable.

In Rivera, we refined the standard of review for departures under the first prong, finding plenary review appropriate to determine whether the allegedly special circumstances underlying the departure \"are of a 'kind' that the Sentencing Guidelines, in principle, permit the sentencing court to consider.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">951</span></a></span>.

Similarly deferential is our review of the second and third prongs, that is, the sentencing court's findings of fact and the direction and degree of departure, respectively.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> 994 F.2d </a></span>at 950.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing judge is not required to ignore the consequences of a fraud scheme outside the immediate monetary loss.  If the evidence shows that the defendant's offense was more serious than contemplated by the applicable guidelines, the judge can depart upward.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b) (general principle);  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment (n. 10).  Application Note 10 provides a nonexclusive list of circumstances where the loss determined in section 2F1.1(b)(1) does not fully capture the harmfulness of the conduct and, thus, departure may be warranted.  In this case, we begin by noting that the amount of money and the number of victims had already been factored into the calculation of Pelkey's base offense level under the Guidelines.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1) and (b)(2)(B).  In addition, the special vulnerability resulting from the age of the victims and their relationship with the Defendant had also been taken into account.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3A1.1.  Accordingly, if we are to avoid double-counting in this case, the departure can be valid only if it was properly based on the victims' resulting financial strain or psychological harm.  We will deal with each issue in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Financial Strain of Victims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal reason given by the district court for departure was the victims' limited ability to recover from the loss of accumulated savings and the resulting financial stress associated with the loss of life savings.  This presents for our determination the issue of whether these facts are unusual and, therefore, worthy of departure.  Accordingly, we will \"accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous\" and will \"give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert and Kim Atma's financial loss represented their accumulated life savings of more than 20 years.  Already retired, Katherine Meuse and Julie Laskey, now without their retirement savings, are forced to live on social security and to borrow from friends and relatives.  In addition, Ms. Meuse has been forced to forego physical examinations and medication for her heart problem.  Pelkey's scheme left Robert LeClair \"financially depleted.\"   Mr. LeClair was forced to go back to work full time at age 60, his automobile has been repossessed, and he was forced to take out a home equity loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nonexclusive list of grounds for departure under Application Note 10 of section 2F1.1 does not include the reasons given by the district court for departure.  The failure to have a secure financial future does not, without more, rise to the level of seriousness contemplated by the other grounds for departure suggested in the application note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The bases for departure provided in Application Note 10 all suggest unusual repercussions beyond the loss of financial capacity and the general sense of betrayal normally associated with fraud involving false pretenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that there is a distinction between defrauding a 40-year-old of her life savings and defrauding a 60-year-old of her savings;  that is, the 40-year-old is capable of recouping at least some of the loss, while the 60-year-old may have little or no opportunity to recover from the financial loss.  This distinction is, at least partially, reflected in the enhancement for vulnerable victims and, in any case, does not warrant a five-level departure.  Therefore, the upward departure in this case must be vacated.  On remand, if the court were to make specific findings that some of the victims were unable to provide for their welfare or that the facts present a situation equal to the serious caliber of the other basis suggested for departure in Application Note 10, departure may be appropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Psychological Injury to Victims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also gave as a secondary reason for departure the victims' psychological injuries.  \"[P]hysical or psychological harm\" to the victim is specifically mentioned under Application Note 10(c) as a possible basis for departure.  An upward departure grounded on psychological injury is appropriate only when the injury is \"much more serious than that normally resulting from commission of the offense,\" U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.3, and only when there is a \"substantial impairment of the intellectual, psychological, emotional, or behavioral functioning of a victim, when the impairment is likely to be of an extended or continuous duration, and when the impairment manifests itself by physical or psychological symptoms or by changes in behavior patterns.\"   Id.; United States v. Astorri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554903\"><a href=\"/opinion/554903/united-states-v-dennis-l-astorri/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span></a></span>, 1059 (3d Cir.1991) (court upheld two-level departure for psychological harm where evidence showed that a victim suffered from high blood pressure and was under a doctor's care as a result of defendant's actions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, in this case, of psychological injury to the victims was, at best, meager.  All of the victims expressed the feeling that they had lost trust in their ability to judge others.  In addition, the record reveals that the Atmas, who considered themselves \"best friends\" of Pelkey for over 22 years, suffered a sense of severe shock after learning of the fraudulent real estate scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Ms. Meuse and Ms. Laskey, friends and former clients of Pelkey, told the probation officer that they experienced pain, frustration, and depression over the knowledge that they will not live their senior years without fear of financial burden.  Sean Tracey told the Probation Officer that he suffered lingering feelings of distrust for others as a result of the offense.  The victim experiencing the most severe psychic harm appears to be Mr. LeClair, Pelkey's former business associate.  Mr. LeClair disclosed to the probation officer that he was in an \"emotionally drained state,\" experiencing moments of extreme despair and thoughts of suicide.  No medical or psychological records were offered and there is no evidence that treatment was received by any of the victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence is altogether insufficient to permit departure for psychological injury.  We do not think that feelings of lack of trust, frustration, shock, and depression suffered by Pelkey's victims are so far beyond the heartland of fraud offenses as to constitute psychological harm within the meaning of the Policy Statement in Sec. 5K2.3 or Application Note 10(c) to Sec. 2F1.1;  United States v. Lara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591154\"><a href=\"/opinion/591154/united-states-v-yolanda-c-lara/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></a></span>, 1128 (5th Cir.1992) (finding inadequate proof of harm).  Some degree of consequential trust and reliance by the victim is to be expected in the majority of fraud cases involving false pretenses, and the presence of such reliance will not generally justify departure.  In sum, the injuries these people suffered were no worse than that of many fraud victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The recommended total adjusted offense level of 16 included:  a base offense level of six for fraud, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1;  plus nine levels for the loss involved in the offense of conviction and relevant conduct, totalling between $350,000 and $500,000, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1);  plus a two-level enhancement for more than one victim, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2)(B);  plus a two-level enhancement for vulnerable victim, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3A1.1;  less three levels for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a) and (b)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court disagreed with the report in two respects.  First, the court found the total amount of loss was $576,290.40 rather than $364,264.47.  The effect of this determination on the adjustment for the specific offense characteristics was that the adjustment would be plus ten rather than plus nine, thus raising Pelkey to a total adjusted offense level of 17.  Next, the court found that the sentences described in the criminal history section of the Presentence Report, giving rise to the state court convictions, were sentences for conduct that was \"part of the instant offense.\"   As a result, the court found that Pelkey should receive no criminal history points, changing her criminal history category from II to I.  The Court notes, however, that the recalculation of Pelkey's offense characteristics and criminal history category did not change the sentencing range from that recommended in the Presentence Report</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court explained its reasons for departure both from the bench and in written Supplemental Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  We quote these findings and conclusions at length in order to show a complete understanding of the basis for the district court's decision</p>\n        <p>I have departed upwards in sentencing the defendant from a level 17 to a level 22 because I have determined that aggravating circumstances exist in this case of a kind and degree not taken into account by the Sentencing Commission.  As a result of this upward departure, I have sentenced the defendant to 43 months.  I have departed upwards for the following reasons:</p>\n        <p>(a) Application Note 10 to Section 2F1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that \"[i]n cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted.\"   I have relied upon this note in making an upward departure.</p>\n        <p>(b) The primary reason why the loss in this case does not represent the seriousness and harmfulness of the defendant's conduct is that the losses suffered by several of the victims represented all or partially all of their life savings.  Further, in several cases, the victims were elderly or nearing retirement and the ability of these victims to recover from the losses they suffered is quite limited.  Thus, the losses here will require several of the victims to live out their lives under severe financial constraints that they would not otherwise have had to suffer if the defendant had not engaged in her criminal conduct.  Given the defendant's close friendship with several of these elderly victims, it is reasonable to conclude that she was or should have been aware that her course of conduct would deprive these victims of all or most of their retirement savings.  This is a factor which the Guidelines could not possibly have considered in measuring the offense level that should be assigned to the defendant's conduct.</p>\n        <p>(c) A secondary reason for the departure is that there is evidence reflected in the Presentence Report that several victims have suffered extreme psychological injury as a result of the defendant's conduct.  Moreover, given the defendant's exploitation of her close friendship with several of the victims, it is reasonable to assume that she was or should have been aware of the risk of extreme psychological injury that could result from her conduct.  While it could be debated whether the psychological injuries suffered by the victims in this case are so severe as to qualify for departure under Sec. 5K2.3 of the Guidelines, I find that the psychological injuries suffered here, in combination with the other reasons I have expressed, are serious enough to warrant an upward departure.</p>\n        <p>Supplemental Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 4-5.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Examples of fraud of a more serious caliber given in the Application Note are:</p>\n        <p>(a) the primary objective of the fraud was non-monetary;</p>\n        <p>(b) false statements were made for the purpose of facilitating some other crime;</p>\n        <p>(c) the offense caused physical or psychological harm;</p>\n        <p>(d) the offense endangered national security or military readiness;</p>\n        <p>(e) the offense caused a loss of confidence in an important institution.</p>\n        <p>U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment (n. 10).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The Court notes that Application Note 10 has since been amended to provide that departure may be appropriate if \"the offense involved the knowing endangerment of the solvency of one or more victims.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment (n. 10(f)) (1993).  This seems to address the type of harm the court was attempting to quantify.  A departure based on these grounds requires a court to find that a defendant knowingly pushed a victim into extreme financial hardship</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Robert Atma's victim impact statement also references \"mental anguish and heartache\" resulting from the unexplained geographical separation from his wife.
