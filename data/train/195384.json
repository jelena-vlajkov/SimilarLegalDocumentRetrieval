Ciolino,  Attorney,  Office  of\n                                          \nImmigration Litigation, Department of Justice,  on Respondent's Motion\nto Lift Stay of Deportation.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.  We grant the government's motion, lift\n                    \n\nthe stay  of deportation, and summarily  dismiss the petition\n\nfor review for three reasons.\n\n          1.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) was  not\n\nrequired  to  believe  petitioner's late  proffered  claim of\n\ninability  to prepare for, or  proceed at, the  June 11, 1991\n\nhearing  because   of  an  earlier  heart   attack.    First,\n\npetitioner, a college graduate, indicated at the hearing only\n\nthat   his  heart   attack   had  delayed   his  mailing   of\n\ndocumentation  \"a  little.\"    Neither  in  response  to  the\n\nImmigration  and  Naturalization   Service's  argument   that\n\npetitioner had adequate time to  prepare and should be denied\n\na continuance nor in his administrative appeal did petitioner\n\nclaim  physical  distress  or  inability  to  concentrate  or\n\nprepare.  While petitioner now claims that he did not mention\n\nproblems related to  his health because he did not appreciate\n\ntheir  relevance, the BIA  was not  required to  believe that\n\nexplanation.   Second, the medical reports  did not establish\n\nthat   petitioner's  heart   condition  precluded   him  from\n\ncontacting a  lawyer, preparing for the  hearing, or thinking\n\nclearly during  the hearing.   Indeed,  according to  his own\n\naccount, petitioner  had been active in  the months following\n\nthe attack contacting every lawyer  on the list and obtaining\n\ndocuments.   Having  implicitly discounted  petitioner's late\n\nclaim of  severe  disability,  the BIA  did  not  exceed  its\n\nauthority  in refusing  to excuse  claimant's lack  of candor\n\nduring the June  11 hearing, in concluding petitioner  had an\n\nadequate  opportunity  to  obtain  counsel,  or  in   denying\n\npetitioner's motion for reconsideration.\n\n          2.    Petitioner  contends  the  Immigration  Judge\n\n(I.J.) should have inquired  further into petitioner's health\n\nand expressly considered the cardiac condition in determining\n\nwhether to grant discretionary relief.  Regardless whether or\n\nnot  the I.J.'s  inquiries were  adequate, the BIA  has since\n\nexpressly  considered  petitioner's  medical   condition  and\n\nconcluded  that adverse  factors (e.g.,  petitioner's serious\n                                      \n\ntrafficking  conviction  and  lack of  remorse)  outweigh any\n\ndemonstrated  equities.   The  BIA's  determination was  well\n\nwithin its broad range of discretion.\n\n          3.  Petitioner failed to argue below that  8 C.F.R.\n\n  242.1(c) was violated and therefore may not raise the issue\n\nnow.  See Cabral de Faria v. INS, 13 F.3d 422 (1st Cir. 1993)\n                                \n\n(issues not raised before the Board may not be raised for the\n\nfirst time upon judicial review).\n\n          The  petition  for  judicial  review  is  summarily\n\ndenied and this court's February  1, 1994 stay of deportation\n\nis vacated.  Loc. R. 27.1.\n\n                             -3-\n",
