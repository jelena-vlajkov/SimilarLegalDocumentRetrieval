In moving for a  continuance one month\r\n\nafter  he  had  entered an  appearance,  petitioner's counsel\r\n\nmerely asserted  that he \"suspect[ed] that  a post-conviction\r\n\napplication would be based on the failure to give Immigration\r\n\nwarnings.\"  He did  not explain the basis for  his suspicion.\r\n\nFor  example, he did not indicate whether he had reviewed the\r\n\nstate  court papers,  conferred with  trial counsel,  or even\r\n\ntalked  with petitioner  to determine whether  petitioner had\r\n\nbeen aware of the possibility  of deportation when he entered\r\n\nhis nolo  contendere plea.  We need not now decide under what\r\n\ncircumstances, if  any, an  immigration judge should  grant a\r\n\ncontinuance in order to  allow a convicted alien to  pursue a\r\n\ncollateral attack on his conviction.  We simply conclude that\r\n\nin view  of counsel's  meager showing, the  immigration judge\r\n\ndid not abuse his discretion in denying a continuance in this\r\n\ncase.\r\n\n     The petition  for judicial  review is  summarily denied.\r\n\nLoc.
