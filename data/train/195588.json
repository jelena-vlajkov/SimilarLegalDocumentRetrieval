Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                     \n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                                          \n                Selya and Cyr, Circuit Judges.\n                                             \n\n                                        \n\nErico Davias on briefs pro se.\n            \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per Curiam.  The judgments are affirmed in both of these\n               \n\nconsolidated  appeals.  In  No. 93-2279,  plaintiff complains\n\nthat  one or more employees  in the prison  mailroom opened a\n\npiece  of correspondence  sent to  him from  federal district\n\ncourt.  Incorporated into his amended complaint is a response\n\nto a  grievance filed by  plaintiff in  connection with  this\n\nincident, in  which the  warden explained  that the mail  had\n\nbeen opened  by  mistake.   Based  on this  explanation,  the\n\nmagistrate-judge  found  that  plaintiff was  complaining  of\n\nsimple  negligence on  the  part of  defendant--a finding  to\n\nwhich  plaintiff has not objected.   It is  well settled that\n\nsuch  an allegation fails to state  a claim under 42 U.S.C.  \n\n1983.   See,  e.g., Daniels  v. Williams,  474 U.S.  327, 328\n                                        \n\n(1986) (\"the Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a\n\nnegligent act  of an official  causing unintended loss  of or\n         \n\ninjury   to  life,  liberty,   or  property\")   (emphasis  in\n\noriginal); Germany v. Vance, 868 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1989).\n                           \n\n     In  No.  93-2290,  plaintiff challenges  the  procedures\n\nsurrounding his extradition from  Louisiana to New  Hampshire\n\nin   June   1991.     The   district   court  (adopting   the\n\nrecommendations  of the  magistrate-judge)  dismissed on  res\n\njudicata  grounds,  finding  that  plaintiff  had  brought  a\n\nsimilar challenge in  a separate state-court suit.   From the\n\nrecord  before us, we are unable to confirm that judgment has\n\nissued  in that  proceeding.   This is  unimportant, however,\n\n                             -3-\n\ninasmuch  as  plaintiff's allegations  here are  identical to\n\nthose  advanced in  an earlier  federal  action that  was the\n\nsubject of our decision  in Davias v. New Hampshire,  No. 93-\n                                                   \n\n1405 (1st Cir. Dec. 15, 1993) (per curiam).  Dismissal of the\n\ninstant  action  on res  judicata  grounds  was thus  plainly\n\nwarranted--if not  on the  basis of plaintiff's  state suit--\n\nthen on the basis of his earlier federal proceeding.  \n\n     The judgments are affirmed.\n                                \n\n                             -4-\n",
