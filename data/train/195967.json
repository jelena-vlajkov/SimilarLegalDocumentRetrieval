This is an appeal  by pro se debtor-\r                                \n\nappellant Gaudet  from a district court  intermediate appeal,\n\nGaudet  v.  Boyajian, No.  92-0616B  (D.R.I.  May 16,  1994),\r                                \n\naffirming a bankruptcy  court order requiring  Gaudet to  pay\n\ntrustee-appellee Boyajian  $28,000 in  fees  and costs  as  a\n\nsanction \"for the  legal services attributable  to [Gaudet's]\n\nfrivolous  litigation during  the course  of  this bankruptcy\n\ncase.\"   In re Gaudet, 144 B.R. 223, 224 (Bankr.D.R.I. 1992).\r                                 \n\nThe district court, concluding that the bankruptcy court  was\n\nauthorized to assess the fee sanction, affirmed the order and\n\nGaudet appeals.\n\n     Trustee-appellee  Boyajian moves  to dismiss  the appeal\n\ncontending  that this court is without appellate jurisdiction\n\nto  review the  judgment  affirming  the  bankruptcy  court's\n\norder.   We agree, but find the notice of appeal timely as to\n\nthe denial  of Gaudet's  post-judgment motion,  which remains\n\nopen to review.\n\n     A brief recitation of the pertinent facts is in order:\n\n1.   On  May 16, 1994, after  hearing on April  28, 1994, the\n\ndistrict court entered  an order and  judgment affirming  the\n\nbankruptcy court's order.\n\n2.   On June 2, 1994, Gaudet  filed a motion entitled \"Notice\n\nand  Motion  to  Extend  Time.\"    The  motion  requested  an\n\nextension of time in which to file a  motion for rehearing of\n\nthe  May 16,  1994,  order.   Specifically, Gaudet  sought to\n\ndelay the filing  of the intended  rehearing motion until  15\n\ndays  after  the  receipt  of  the  April 28,  1994,  hearing\n\ntranscript  which, he  asserted, was  needed to  complete the\n\nproposed motion.\r\r\n\n3.   On June 20,  1994, the district  court entered a  margin\n\norder summarily denying the Notice and Motion to Extend Time.\n\n4.   On  July  19,  1994--sixty-four  days  after  entry   of\n\njudgment  and thirty  days after the  denial of  the motion--\n\nGaudet filed a  notice of  appeal \"from the  [June 20,  1994]\n\norder denying his motion . . . of June 2, 1994.\"\n\n5.   On August 2, 1994, Gaudet filed a statement of issues on\n\nappeal challenging the bankruptcy court's authority to impose\n\nan attorney  fee  sanction for  Gaudet's  overall  litigation\n\nconduct, including actions in the appellate courts.\n\n     As  a threshold matter, although the notice of appeal on\n\nits face  shows an appeal  from the denial of  the Notice and\n\nMotion to Extend, it is obvious--from the statement of issues\n\nand other filings in this court--that Gaudet seeks to revisit\n\nthe district court judgment affirming  the bankruptcy court's\n\norder.  It  is undisputed that the notice of appeal was filed\n\nmore than thirty days after entry of  that judgment.  Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 4(a)(1).  That a  notice of appeal be timely filed is\n\n\"mandatory and jurisdictional.\"   Browder v. Director,  Dep't\r                                                                         \n\nof  Corrections, 434 U.S. 257, 264 (1978).  However, a motion\r                           \n\nto  alter or amend judgment  under Fed. R.  Civ. P. 59(e), if\n\nserved within ten days of judgment, postpones the period  for\n\nappealing the judgment until the district court's disposes of\n\nthe motion.  Rule 4(a)(4)(C).\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     The  question arises  whether the  Notice and  Motion to\n\nExtend could be construed as  a Rule 59(e) motion.   We think\n\nnot.  Although the motion was  served on May 31, 1994, within\n\nthe ten-day period, and was ostensibly timely for Rule  59(e)\n\npurposes,  Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a); Rivera v. M/T Fossarina, 840\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  152,  154 (1st  Cir. 1988)  (the  date of  service, not\n\nfiling, controls),  there are otherwise none  of the earmarks\n\nof  a  cognizable  motion for  Rule  59(e)  relief.   It  was\n\ndesigned  as motion  to  extend time  to  file a  motion  for\n\nrehearing, but the time to file a Rule 59(e) motion cannot be\n\nextended.   Id. n.3.   It  was unaccompanied  by any  kind of\r                           \n\nstatement  indicating   why  the  ruling  below  was  legally\n\nincorrect, and, thus, failed utterly to comply with the basic\n\nrequirements  of Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 7(b)(1)  that grounds  for\n\nmotion  relief be stated with particularity.   See Sierra On-\r                                                                         \n\nLine, Inc.  v. Phoenix  Software, Inc.,  739 F.2d 1415,  1420\r                                                  \n\n(9th Cir. 1984).   In short, under the most  charitable view,\n\nGaudet's Notice and Motion to Extend cannot, in substance, be\n\ntreated as a Rule 59(e) motion and is ineffective to preserve\n\nany  Rule 59(e) rights.   See Perez-Perez  v. Popular Leasing\r                                                                         \n\nRental, Inc., 993  F.2d 281, 283 (1st  Cir. 1993) (substance,\r                        \n\nnot  nomenclature, determines character of motion); Feinstein\r                                                                         \n\nv. Moses, 951  F.2d 16,  20 (1st Cir.  1991) (order  allowing\r                    \n\nmotion  to  enlarge  did  not implicate  Rule  59(e)  tolling\n\nbecause motion failed to apprise court of grounds for seeking\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nreconsideration).  As a consequence, the 30-day appeal period\n\nwas not extended and the  notice of appeal is late as  to the\n\njudgment,  precluding its  review in  this court.1   See  Air\r                                                                         \n\nLine Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, 26 F.3d  220,\r                                                          \n\n224 (1st Cir. 1994) (non-conforming Rule 59(e) motions do not\n\nresurrect an expired right to appeal the merits of underlying\n\njudgment); Rivera, 840 F.2d at 156. \r                             \n\n     While our  jurisdiction over an appeal  from judgment is\n\nforeclosed, the notice of  appeal is timely as to  the denial\n\nof  the  Notice  and Motion  to  Extend  Time.   Nonetheless,\n\npresuming  that   Gaudet  sought  more  time   to  press  for\n\nreconsideration of  the underlying judgment under Rule 59(e),\n\n\"it is well  established that district  courts lack power  to\n\nenlarge the time  for filing post-judgment motions  for a new\n\ntrial or motions to alter or amend judgment.\"  Feinstein, 951\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d at 19  &amp; n.3.  Since the district court lacked authority\n\nto extend the  time for  Gaudet to  file such  a motion,  its\n\nsummary denial was entirely proper.  Id. at 21.  \r                                                    \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Nor could the Notice and Motion to Extend Time, which did\nnot designate the rule relied upon, conceivably be treated as\na  motion under Fed. R. App.  P. 4(a)(5) to extend the 30-day\nappeal  period because  of excusable  neglect or  good cause.\nGaudet's  casual filing  offered no legitimate  or compelling\nreason whatsoever, much less developed  argument, for failing\nto file  a timely  notice of  appeal from  judgment.   In any\nevent,  as Gaudet's  notice  of appeal  was ultimately  filed\nsixty-four days after judgment,  Rule 4(a)(5), which enlarges\nthe appeal period to  no more than sixty days,  would provide\nno relief.    \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     Even  if  the  Notice  and  Motion to  Extend  Time  was\n\ngenerously construed  as a  request for relief  from judgment\n\nunder Fed.  R. Civ. P. 60(b),  given the history of  the case\n\nand the  failure to  identify any facially  sufficient ground\n\nfor such a  motion, there was no  abuse of discretion  in its\n\ndenial.   The extraordinary relief afforded  by Rule 60(b) is\n\navailable  only in  exceptional  circumstances,  clearly  not\n\npresent here.   See id. at 21 n.5; United States v. One Urban\r                                                                         \n\nLot, 882 F.2d 582, 585 (1st Cir. 1989).\r               \n\n     Appellee also  seeks sanctions  from this court  for the\n\nfiling  of this untimely appeal.  However, the appeal was not\n\nuntimely  in all respects.   We trust that  appellant is well\n\naware  that   frivolous  filings   will  not   be  tolerated.\n\nAppellee's motion for sanctions is denied.  \n\n     In  sum, insofar  as  Gaudet is  contesting the  May 16,\n\n1994, judgment affirming the  September 2, 1993, decision and\n\norder  of the bankruptcy  court, the appeal  is dismissed for\n\nlack of  appellate jurisdiction.   To the extent  that Gaudet\n\ncontests  the  June 20,  1994, order  denying his  Notice and\n\nMotion to Extend Time, that order is affirmed.\n\n     It is so ordered.\r                                 \n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

Boyajian, No. 92-0616B (D.R.I. May 16, 1994), affirming a bankruptcy court order requiring Gaudet to pay trustee-appellee Boyajian $28,000 in fees and costs as a sanction \"for the legal services attributable to [Gaudet's] frivolous litigation during the course of this bankruptcy case.\"  In re Gaudet, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1521095\"><a href=\"/opinion/1521095/in-re-gaudet/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 224 (Bankr.D.R.I. 1992).  The district court, concluding that the bankruptcy court was authorized to assess the fee sanction, affirmed the order and Gaudet appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trustee-appellee Boyajian moves to dismiss the appeal contending that this court is without appellate jurisdiction to review the judgment affirming the bankruptcy court's order.  We agree, but find the notice of appeal timely as to the denial of Gaudet's post-judgment motion, which remains open to review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A brief recitation of the pertinent facts is in order:  1. On May 16, 1994, after hearing on April 28, 1994, the district court entered an order and judgment affirming the bankruptcy court's order. 2. On June 2, 1994, Gaudet filed a motion entitled \"Notice and Motion to Extend Time.\"  The motion requested an extension of time in which to file a motion for rehearing of the May 16, 1994, order.  Specifically, Gaudet sought to delay the filing of the intended rehearing motion until 15 days after the receipt of the April 28, 1994, hearing transcript which, he asserted, was needed to complete the proposed motion. 3. On June 20, 1994, the district court entered a margin order summarily denying the Notice and Motion to Extend Time. 4. On July 19, 1994-sixty-four days after entry of judgment and thirty days after the denial of the motion-Gaudet filed a notice of appeal \"from the [June 20, 1994] order denying his motion ... of June 2, 1994.\" 5. On August 2, 1994, Gaudet filed a statement of issues on appeal challenging the bankruptcy court's authority to impose an attorney fee sanction for Gaudet's overall litigation conduct, including actions in the appellate courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, although the notice of appeal on its face shows an appeal from the denial of the Notice and Motion to Extend, it is obvious-from the statement of issues and other filings in this court-that Gaudet seeks to revisit the district court judgment affirming the bankruptcy court's order.  It is undisputed that the notice of appeal was filed more than thirty days after entry of that judgment.  Fed. R. App.  P. 4(a)(1).  That a notice of appeal be timely filed is \"mandatory and jurisdictional.\"  Browder v. Director, Dep't of Corrections, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109761\"><a href=\"/opinion/109761/browder-v-director-dept-of-corrections-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 264 (1978).  However, a motion to alter or amend judgment under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 59(e), if served within ten days of judgment, postpones the period for appealing the judgment until the district court's disposes of the motion.  Rule 4(a)(4)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question arises whether the Notice and Motion to Extend could be construed as a Rule 59(e) motion.  We think not.  Although the motion was served on May 31, 1994, within the ten-day period, and was ostensibly timely for Rule 59(e) purposes, Fed.  R. Civ. P. 6(a);  Rivera v. M/T Fossarina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502258\"><a href=\"/opinion/502258/jose-rivera-v-mt-fossarina/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir. 1988) (the date of service, not filing, controls), there are otherwise none of the earmarks of a cognizable motion for Rule 59(e) relief.  It was designed as motion to extend time to file a motion for rehearing, but the time to file a Rule 59(e) motion cannot be extended.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502258\"><a href=\"/opinion/502258/jose-rivera-v-mt-fossarina/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> n.3.  It </a></span>was unaccompanied by any kind of statement indicating why the ruling below was legally incorrect, and, thus, failed utterly to comply with the basic requirements of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1) that grounds for motion relief be stated with particularity.  See Sierra On-Line, Inc. v. Phoenix Software, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439156\"><a href=\"/opinion/439156/sierra-on-line-inc-v-phoenix-software-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1415</span></a></span>, 1420 (9th Cir. 1984).  In short, under the most charitable view, Gaudet's Notice and Motion to Extend cannot, in substance, be treated as a Rule 59(e) motion and is ineffective to preserve any Rule 59(e) rights.  See Perez-Perez v. Popular Leasing Rental, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606663\"><a href=\"/opinion/606663/agustina-perez-perez-v-popular-leasing-rental-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 283 (1st Cir. 1993) (substance, not nomenclature, determines character of motion);  Feinstein v. Moses, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573153\"><a href=\"/opinion/573153/frederick-feinstein-v-morris-and-joyce-moses-dba-sun-cal-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir. 1991) (order allowing motion to enlarge did not implicate Rule 59(e) tolling because motion failed to apprise court of grounds for seeking reconsideration).  As a consequence, the 30-day appeal period was not extended and the notice of appeal is late as to the judgment, precluding its review in this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672031\"><a href=\"/opinion/672031/air-line-pilots-association-v-precision-valley-aviation-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir. 1994) (non-conforming Rule 59(e) motions do not resurrect an expired right to appeal the merits of underlying judgment);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502258\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/502258/jose-rivera-v-mt-fossarina/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While our jurisdiction over an appeal from judgment is foreclosed, the notice of appeal is timely as to the denial of the Notice and Motion to Extend Time.  Nonetheless, presuming that Gaudet sought more time to press for reconsideration of the underlying judgment under Rule 59(e), \"it is well established that district courts lack power to enlarge the time for filing post-judgment motions for a new trial or motions to alter or amend judgment.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573153\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Feinstein,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/573153/frederick-feinstein-v-morris-and-joyce-moses-dba-sun-cal-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">19</span> </a></span>&amp; n.3.  Since the district court lacked authority to extend the time for Gaudet to file such a motion, its summary denial was entirely proper.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573153\"><a href=\"/opinion/573153/frederick-feinstein-v-morris-and-joyce-moses-dba-sun-cal-products/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 21.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Notice and Motion to Extend Time was generously construed as a request for relief from judgment under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 60(b), given the history of the case and the failure to identify any facially sufficient ground for such a motion, there was no abuse of discretion in its denial.  The extraordinary relief afforded by Rule 60(b) is available only in exceptional circumstances, clearly not present here.
