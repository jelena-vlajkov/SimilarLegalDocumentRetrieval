On  September  2,  1992,   Richard\r                                 \r\n\nMcEachern, a  Maine state  prisoner, filed a  pro se  federal\r                                                                \r\n\ncivil rights action against Donald Allen, Commissioner of the\r\n\nMaine Department of Corrections, and Martin Magnusson, Warden\r\n\nof the Maine  State Prison.1  The  parties eventually reached\r                                       1\r\n\nan  out-of-court settlement  agreement under  which McEachern\r\n\nagreed  to  dismiss the  pending  lawsuit in  exchange  for a\r\n\ntransfer to a prison  in New Jersey.2  At the time, McEachern\r                                                2\r\n\nwas  housed at  Maine's  highest security  prison, the  Maine\r\n\nCorrectional Institution  in Warren (MCI-Warren).   On  March\r\n\n25, 1994, the  parties filed a stipulation of  dismissal with\r\n\nprejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(ii).\r\n\n          Following   the   dismissal,  McEachern   was  duly\r\n\ntransferred to a  New Jersey  prison.  On  February 3,  1995,\r\n\nhowever, McEachern  filed a motion and  affidavit pursuant to\r\n\nFed.  R. Civ. P. 60(b)  to void the  settlement agreement and\r\n\nreinstate  his lawsuit on the ground that he had been coerced\r\n\ninto  settling  his  case  by  the  \"inhumane  and  punitive\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1As amended, the complaint also names Deputy Warden Arthur\r               1\r\nKiskila as a defendant.\r\n\n   2The agreement  also provided that McEachern could request\r               2\r\nthe Maine Department  of Corrections  to provide  him with  a\r\nPine Tree Legal Assistance attorney should he need  access to\r\nMaine legal  materials in connection with  any future actions\r\nin Maine courts.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nenvironment at MCI-Warren.3  The motion  was denied, and this\r                                      3\r\n\nappeal followed.\r\n\n          McEachern argues that his Rule 60(b) motion  should\r\n\nhave  been allowed because it  was filed within  one year and\r\n\nset  forth  extraordinary  circumstances   warranting  relief\r\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.  60(b)(6).  We disagree.  A party\r\n\nseeking relief under any  provision of Rule 60(b) must  do so\r\n\nwithin  a \"reasonable  time.\"4   Fed. R.  Civ. P.  60(b); see\r                                         4                               \r\n\nalso  Planet Corp. v. Sullivan,  702 F.2d 123,  126 (7th Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1983)  (explaining that  what  constitutes a  reasonable time\r\n\ndepends  on the facts of each case, taking into consideration\r\n\nthe interest in finality, the reason for delay, the practical\r\n\nability to  learn earlier  of  the grounds  relied upon,  and\r\n\nprejudice to other parties).   McEachern failed to adequately\r\n\nexplain why, after being transferred to New Jersey, he waited\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   3McEachern  also alleged,  as  an  additional  ground  for\r               3\r\nreopening  the  dismissed  suit,  that  defendants failed  to\r\ncomply with their agreement  to provide him with a  Pine Tree\r\nLegal  Assistance attorney.   McEachern  does not  renew this\r\nargument on appeal, and we deem the issue waived.  \r\n\n   4Since McEachern filed his  motion within one year, we  do\r               4\r\nnot  need  to  decide  which   provision  of  Rule  60(b)  is\r\napplicable.   We note, however, that to the extent the motion\r\nis grounded  on alleged misconduct  of an  adverse party,  it\r\nproperly should have been brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n60(b)(3).  \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nover  ten months  before seeking  relief based  on coercion.5\r                                                                        5\r\n\nWe think this delay was unreasonable.\r\n\n          We add that  McEachern did not claim  that the ill-\r\n\ntreatment he allegedly received at MCI-Warren was directed at\r\n\nforcing him to settle his  lawsuit.  Moreover, the conditions\r\n\nof confinement  he described in  meaningful detail--including\r\n\nthe  number of hours spent  in his cell,  the restrictions on\r\n\nactivities, the requirement that he wear prison clothing, the\r\n\nprohibition on  contact visits, and  the lack of  a canteen--\r\n\nfall within  constitutional limits.   Cf. Rhodes  v. Chapman,\r                                                                        \r\n\n452 U.S.  337, 347 (1981) (observing  that restrictive, harsh\r\n\nconditions are  part of  the penalty that  criminal offenders\r\n\npay  for   their  offense   against  society).     Under  the\r\n\ncircumstances,  we cannot  say  that the  district court  was\r\n\nrequired to hold a  hearing or that it abused  its discretion\r\n\nin denying the requested relief.  See Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1, 3  (1st  Cir. 1995)  (stating that  district courts  enjoy\r\n\nbroad discretion  in deciding motions under Rule 60(b) and we\r\n\nreview such ruling only for abuse of that discretion).\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   5Although McEachern  vaguely alludes, in his affidavit, to\r               5\r\n\"lingering  psychological damage\"  allegedly  caused  by  his\r\ntreatment at  MCI-Warren, his  affidavit reveals that  he had\r\nbeen  actively litigating other matters since his transfer to\r\nNew Jersey.   \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n",
