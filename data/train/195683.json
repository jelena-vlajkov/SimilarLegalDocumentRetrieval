We have  carefully reviewed  the parties'\n                \n\nbriefs  and the  record  on appeal.    We conclude  that  the\n\ndistrict  court  correctly  dismissed the  bankruptcy  appeal\n\nessentially  for the  reasons  stated in  the district  court\n\nmemorandum and  order, In re  Malmart Mortgage Co.,  166 B.R.\n                                                  \n\n499  (D. Mass.  1994).   We  add  that the  district  court's\n\nfailure to  address in more particular  detail the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's order denying appellants' motion for recusal is of no\n\nmoment  since appellants' complaint  was completely  based on\n\ntheir   unhappiness  and  disagreement  with  the  bankruptcy\n\ncourt's  rulings.   \"[J]udicial  rulings  alone almost  never\n\nconstitute  valid basis  for  a bias  or partiality  motion.\"\n\nLiteky v.
