Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\nStahl, Circuit Judge,\r\nCampbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   John E.

Plaintiffs-appellants Rafael Arzuaga\r\nPerello and Beatriz de los Reyes appeal from the district\r\ncourt's dismissal of their complaint for lack of subject matter\r\njurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).  They concede\r\nthat the affidavit submitted by defendant-appellee Shell Co.\r\n(Puerto Rico) Limited (\"Shell\") supports the district court's\r\nruling that diversity of citizenship between the parties is\r\nlacking.  Appellants argue, however, that the district court\r\nabused its discretion by not granting them additional time to\r\nconduct discovery so that they could disprove the factual\r\nallegations contained in the Shell affidavit.\r\n           \"It is well settled that the trial judge has broad\r\ndiscretion in ruling on pre-trial management matters and we\r\nreview the district court's denial of discovery for abuse of\r\nits considerable discretion.  'We will intervene in such\r\nmatters only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that\r\nis, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong\r\nand resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.'\"\r\nAyala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 91 (1st\r\nCir. 1996) (citations omitted).\r\n           When faced with a 12(b)(1) motion, a district court\r\n\"may allow discovery to be completed on the issue and a further\r\nhearing to be held before ruling on the motion.\" 5A Charles\r\nAlan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \r\n1350 (2d ed. 1990).  \"Where the defendant has challenged the\r\nplaintiff's  assertion of  federal  jurisdiction  under  Rule \r\n                             -2- \r\n12(b)(1), the court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to\r\npresent facts in support of his jurisdictional contention.\"\r\nBerrios v. Department of Army, 884 F.2d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\n           Here, the district court gave appellants such an\r\nopportunity by granting their request for a thirty-day\r\nextension of time to oppose the motion to dismiss.  Despite the\r\nextra time, appellants failed even to identify a theory under\r\nwhich the Shell affidavit could be attacked.  Compare Madj-Pourv. Georgiana Community Hosp., Inc., 724 F.2d 901, 903 (11th\r\nCir. 1984)(reversing and remanding Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal\r\nwhere \"[p]laintiff's counsel alleged that discovery would show\r\nthat the two defendants are actually one entity operating out\r\nof the state of Indiana\"). Appellants have failed to make \"a\r\nclear showing of manifest injustice.\" Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at\r\n91.  There was no abuse of the district court's broad\r\ndiscretion over discovery matters.\r\n           The district court's Opinion and Order dated May 26,\r\n1998, granting appellee's motion to dismiss is affirmed.\r\n",
