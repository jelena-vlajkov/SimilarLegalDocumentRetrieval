ROBERTS,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n                  KEVIN E. ROBERTS, ET AL.,\r\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n        [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\nStahl, Circuit Judge,\r\nCampbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Elaine Whitfield Sharp, Daniel S. Sharp and Whitfield, Sharp &amp; Sharp on brief for appellant.\r\n\nFebruary 9, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon de novo review of the record, and\r\nconsideration of appellant's brief, we conclude that the\r\nsummary judgments for defendants Duffy, Gilleo, and Henderson\r\nshould not be set aside.  We reach this conclusion essentially\r\nfor the reasons given in the magistrate judge's Report and\r\nRecommendation dated February 27, 1998, and in the district\r\ncourt's Memorandum and Order dated May 12, 1998.  We add only\r\none comment.  \r\n           Any procedural irregularity in entering judgment for\r\ndefendant Gilleo was harmless, because, in connection with the\r\nDorsey defendants' motion for summary judgment, appellant had\r\nample opportunity and motivation to litigate the question of\r\ndefendant Gilleo's role.  See Berkovitz v. Home Box Office,\r\nInc., 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996); Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v.\r\nDiaz-Martinez, 878 F.2d 1555, 1561 (1st Cir. 1989).  The\r\nfindings and conclusions on that subject in the magistrate\r\njudge's Report and Recommendation effectively disposed of the\r\nclaims against defendant Gilleo.  Appellant failed to object to\r\nany aspect of that Report and Recommendation, and judgment was\r\nentered accordingly.  See United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761,\r\n766 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996).  Even were we inclined to consider\r\nappellant's belated and forfeited arguments now, in any event,\r\nthose arguments do not persuade us that any viable claims\r\nremained.\r\n\n                              -2-\r\n           As appellant has appealed from the judgments for\r\ndefendants Duffy, Gilleo, and Henderson only, the motion of the\r\nDorsey defendants is denied as moot.\r\n           Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
