This troublesome appeal involves\r                                      \r\n\na determination of benefits  due following the termination of\r\n\na  pension  plan.    On May  18,  1983,  Trimount  Bituminous\r\n\nProducts  Co. (\"Trimount\")  purchased Lynn  Sand &amp;  Stone Co.\r\n\n(\"Lynn\").   At the time of the purchase, Lynn had in place an\r\n\nemployer-sponsored, defined-benefit  pension plan.   The plan\r\n\nwas subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\r\n\n1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C.   1001 et seq.\r                                                    \r\n\n     At  the time of the  purchase, in May  1983, James Cooke\r\n\nwas president and treasurer of Lynn and also a trustee of the\r\n\nplan.  Shortly thereafter, Cooke was terminated as an officer\r\n\nunder circumstances not entirely to  his credit, see Cooke v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nLynn Sand &amp; Stone Co., 640 N.E.2d 786 (Mass. 1994), and later\r                                 \r\n\nin the year Lynn replaced the  trustees of the plan and voted\r\n\nto terminate  it.  Article XIV of  the plan permitted Lynn to\r\n\namend or terminate the plan at any time.\r\n\n     The  proposed termination  required  a clearance  by the\r\n\nPension  Benefit Guaranty  Corporation (\"PBGC\"),  the federal\r\n\nagency that insures ERISA-covered pension plans and regulates\r\n\nterminations.   See  29  U.S.C.    1341.   When  an  employer\r                               \r\n\nvoluntarily  terminates  a  single-employer,  defined-benefit\r\n\npension plan, all  accrued benefits  vest automatically,  and\r\n\nthe employer  must  distribute benefits  in  accordance  with\r\n\nERISA's allocation  schedule.  29  U.S.C.    1344(a).   Funds\r\n\nleft  over  may  revert  to  the  employer  if  the  plan  so\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nspecifies, 29  U.S.C.   1344(d),  as the Lynn plan  did.  The\r\n\npresent litigation  presents the question how  much Cooke was\r\n\nentitled to receive on termination of the plan.\r\n\n     In 1983 Cooke--who was then 53 years of age--had accrued\r\n\na monthly retirement benefit of $1,856.93, starting at age 65\r\n\nand continuing  for ten years  or until his  death, whichever\r\n\ncame  first.   The  plan  permitted  the  trustees  to  offer\r\n\nbeneficiaries  an option,  in  lieu of  monthly payments,  of\r\n\nreceiving a lump sum  distribution of equal value.   Choosing\r\n\nto  offer this option to Cooke, the trustees had to determine\r\n\nthe   present  value   of  the  promised   monthly  payments.\r\n\nMortality  assumptions aside,  this required  selection  of a\r\n\n\"discount\"  rate--effectively  an  assumed interest  rate--to\r\n\ncompute  a present lump sum  equal to the  stream of promised\r\n\nfuture  payments.     See  Robert  Anthony   &amp;  James  Reece,\r                                     \r\n\nAccounting Principles 199-203 (1983).\r                                 \r\n\n     The trustees  retained an actuarial  firm which  advised\r\n\nthat, if the trustees  chose to offer lump sum  payments, the\r\n\nappropriate choice  of rates  was between the  PBGC-specified\r\n\ninterest rate of  9.5 percent1 or a somewhat  higher interest\r\n\nrate  of  11 to  11.5  percent,  reflecting the  figure  that\r\n\ncertain insurance companies  would employ  if Lynn  purchased\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The 9.5 percent figure appeared  in a PBGC schedule for\r\ncalculating lump-sum values of  annuities as of a  given plan\r\ntermination  date.   See  29 C.F.R.     2619, App.  B (1986),\r                                    \r\nsetting forth a 9.5 percent rate for plans terminated between\r\nSeptember 1, 1983 and February 1, 1984. \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nannuities instead of  providing lump  sums.   The higher  the\r\n\nrate selected, the  smaller will  be the lump  sum needed  to\r\n\nequal the future stream of payments.  Ultimately, the actuary\r\n\nrecommended the  9.5 percent figure, stating  later that this\r\n\nwas the actuary's best judgment as to the proper rate as well\r\n\nas the rate then commonly used on termination of a plan under\r\n\nERISA.\r\n\n     The use of the  9.5 percent figure equated to a lump sum\r\n\npayment for Cooke of  $58,987.98.  Cooke's attorneys disputed\r\n\nthis computation,  urging (based  on certain language  in the\r\n\nplan yet  to be described)  that a  6 percent rate  should be\r\n\nused; on this premise,  Cooke would have obtained a  lump sum\r\n\nof  $96,892.42.    The trustees  maintained  their  position.\r\n\nUltimately,  the  PBGC issued  a  notice  in September  1984,\r\n\nfinding  that the assets of  the plan would  be sufficient to\r\n\ncover  all guaranteed benefits  and rejecting without comment\r\n\nCooke's objections as to the rate selected.\r\n\n     On  June 14,  1985,  Cooke  filed  a  complaint  in  the\r\n\ndistrict court, contending inter alia that the use of the 9.5\r                                                 \r\n\npercent interest rate violated  the plan and therefore ERISA.\r\n\nCross-motions  for  summary  judgment  were  filed,  and  the\r\n\ndistrict court issued an initial  non-dispositive decision in\r\n\nJuly 1986, relying in part on the trustees' interpretation of\r\n\nthe plan.  See  Cooke v. Lynn Sand &amp; Stone  Co., 673 F. Supp.\r                                                           \r\n\n14 (D. Mass  1986).   Delay then ensued  because the  Supreme\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nCourt granted review in another case  to determine the weight\r\n\nto  be given  under ERISA  to  a trustee's  interpretation of\r\n\ndisputed  terms in a pension  plan.  Firestone  Tire &amp; Rubber\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101 (1989).\r                        \r\n\n     After   Firestone,  the  present   case  was  eventually\r                                  \r\n\ntransferred  to a different district judge.   In the decision\r\n\nnow  before  us,  the   district  court  decided  that  under\r\n\nFirestone  the  trustees' interpretation  was entitled  to no\r                     \r\n\nweight; and based on the court's own reading of the plan, the\r\n\ncourt granted summary judgment  in favor of Cooke.   Cooke v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nLynn Sand  &amp; Stone  Co., 875  F. Supp.  880 (D.  Mass. 1994).\r                                   \r\n\nDefendants in the district court--Lynn, Trimount and the plan\r\n\ntrustees  (collectively  \"Lynn\")--have now  appealed, arguing\r\n\nthat their interpretation deserves weight and is in any event\r\n\ncorrect.       Cooke's  main  argument  in  favor  of  the  6\r\n\npercent rate, adopted  by the district  court, was that  this\r\n\nrate was mandated by  the plan and was not  inconsistent with\r\n\nPBGC regulations.   The plan states in article  I,   22, that\r\n\n\"[f]or  purposes  of   establishing  actuarial   equivalence,\r\n\npresent value  shall be determined by  discounting all future\r\n\npayments for interest and mortality on the basis specified in\r\n\nthe [plan's] Adoption Agreement.\"  Section 1.09 of the plan's\r\n\nadoption agreement, a boilerplate form with checked boxes and\r\n\ninserted  figures, provides  that  in establishing  actuarial\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nequivalence  the  figure  of 6  percent  should  be used  for\r\n\n\"[p]re-retirement interest.\"\r\n\n     In  response,  Lynn  has   argued  that  the  6  percent\r\n\nprovision  applies where a lump sum is paid under the ongoing\r\n\nplan but does not apply to termination payments.  Lynn points\r\n\nto article  XIV,   2, of  the plan, which states  that in the\r\n\nevent of termination, the trustee must \"allocate the [plan's]\r\n\nassets\"  in accordance with 29  U.S.C.   1344.   Section 1344\r\n\nprovides a  mandatory priority schedule for  plan payments on\r\n\ntermination.  Incident to  this and other sections  of ERISA,\r\n\nthe  PBGC has  established regulations  that address  in some\r\n\ndetail the determination of  the interest rate to be  used in\r\n\nlump sum computations when a plan is terminated.\r\n\n     The key  regulation, 29  C.F.R.   2619.26,  is concerned\r\n\nwith the valuing of a lump sum paid in lieu of normal monthly\r\n\nretirement benefits  where a plan's assets  are sufficient to\r\n\ncover all  of its  statutory obligations under  section 1344.\r\n\nThe  regulation  requires the  use  of \"reasonable  actuarial\r\n\nassumptions  as to  interest and  mortality\"; it  directs the\r\n\nplan administrator  to specify  the assumptions  when seeking\r\n\ntermination clearance from the PBGC; it makes the assumptions\r\n\nsubject to PBGC  review and to  re-evaluation of benefits  if\r\n\nthe assumptions  are found unreasonable  by the PBGC;  and it\r\n\nsets forth four \"interest  assumptions\" that are \"among those\r\n\nthat will normally be considered reasonable\":\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     (i)   The rate by the plan for determining lump sum\r\n     amounts  prior to  the date  of termination.   This\r\n     rate may  appear in  the plan documents  or may  be\r\n     inferred from recent plan practice.\r\n     (ii)    The  rate  used   by  the  insurer  in  the\r\n     qualifying  bid under which  the plan administrator\r\n     will purchase  annuities not  being paid as  a lump\r\n     sum. . . .\r\n     (iii)    The interest  rate  used  for the  minimum\r\n     funding standard account pursuant to section 302 of\r\n     the Act and section  412(b) of the Internal Revenue\r\n     Code.\r\n     (iv)     The  PBGC  interest  rate   for  immediate\r\n     annuities in effect on the valuation date set forth\r\n     in Appendix B to this part.\r\n\n     Based  on  this  language,  Lynn argues  that  the  plan\r\n\ntrustees were  entitled to  select any reasonable  rate, that\r\n\nthe 9.5 percent PBGC rate actually adopted is one of the four\r\n\n\"normally . . . considered reasonable\" under  the regulation,\r\n\nand that  the evidence of the actuary hired by Lynn shows the\r\n\n9.5  percent figure was certainly reasonable here.  As to the\r\n\nplan  and adoption agreement, Lynn argues  that the 6 percent\r\n\nprovision  does not apply to  terminations or, if intended to\r\n\napply, is overridden by the regulation.\r\n\n     We start  with the  regulation because, if  so intended,\r\n\nthere is little  doubt that it  would override contrary  plan\r\n\nprovisions.   See 29 U.S.C.   1341(a); 29 C.F.R.   2619.3(a).\r                             \r\n\nGiven the wording  of the regulation and  its likely purpose,\r\n\nwe agree that section  2619.26 would override any contractual\r\n\nprovision   providing  for   a   rate  that   proved  to   be\r\n\n\"unreasonable\" under the regulation.  But the  reasonableness\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nor unreasonableness of the 6 percent figure cannot readily be\r\n\ndetermined on the present state of the record.\r\n\n     Although  the  district  court  deemed  the  6   percent\r\n\ninterest rate reasonable, apparently  because it was the rate\r\n\nspecified  in the plan, the regulation does no more than make\r\n\nthe  plan  rate  used   prior  to  termination  presumptively\r\n\nreasonable.  Further, it  appears from the record that  the 6\r\n\npercent interest rate would generate a lump sum sufficient to\r\n\nbuy  two  annuities,  each  separately  providing  Cooke  the\r                    \r\n\npromised  monthly payments.   Thus,  it is  at least  open to\r\n\nquestion whether  the 6  percent figure is  reasonable.   The\r\n\nrecord does show that the  9.5 percent figure is reasonable--\r\n\nindeed,  arguably generous  to Cooke--but  there can  be more\r\n\nthan one reasonable rate.\r\n\n     If we  assume arguendo that  6 percent  is a  reasonable\r                                                             \r\n\nrate and that the  plan intended it to apply  on termination,\r                                                                        \r\n\nwe see no reason why the plan  could not require the trustees\r\n\nto use  that rate.  It  is true that the  regulation might be\r\n\nread  to reserve  the  choice of  a  reasonable rate  to  the\r\n\ntrustees on  termination, regardless  of what the  plan says.\r\n\nBut the  regulation's language does not  compel that reading,\r\n\nand Lynn  does not show that  such a reading would  serve any\r\n\npurpose; after all, the PBGC can reject a plan-specified rate\r\n\nif the PBGC finds the rate unreasonable.  \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     We turn therefore  to the  contractual question  whether\r\n\nthe  plan should  be read  to require  use  of the  6 percent\r\n\nfigure not only in calculating lump sums paid during the life\r\n\nof the plan  but also lump  sums paid upon termination.   The\r\n\ndistrict  judge who  first  dealt with  the  case deemed  the\r\n\nplan's language ambiguous on this issue,  673 F. Supp. at 22,\r\n\nand  we  share that  judgment.   This  led the  same district\r\n\njudge, as  the  law then  stood  before Firestone,  to  adopt\r                                                             \r\n\nLynn's interpretation  of  the agreement  as  a  \"reasonable\"\r\n\ninterpretation proffered  by the plan trustees,  subject to a\r\n\npossible claim of bad faith.  Id.\r                                             \r\n\n     This solution to plan ambiguities may be a sensible one,\r\n\nespecially because  plan trustees typically (as  here) retain\r\n\nthe power to alter plan provisions by express amendment.  But\r\n\nthe Supreme  Court in Firestone concluded  that the trustees'\r                                           \r\n\nreading of plan language may be given weight only if the plan\r\n\nso provided in  fairly explicit  terms.  Lynn  does point  to\r\n\nsome plan  language marginally helpful to  its position, but,\r\n\non  balance, we agree with  the district judge  who took over\r\n\nthe  case after  Firestone that  the  plan language  does not\r                                      \r\n\nsatisfy Firestone.   See  Rodriguez-Abreu v.  Chase Manhattan\r                                                                         \r\n\nBank, N.A., 986 F.2d 580, 583-84 (1st Cir. 1983).\r                      \r\n\n     Thus, in resolving the  merits we give no weight  to the\r\n\ntrustees' interpretation and review the plan language de novo\r                                                                         \r\n\nand as presenting  an issue of law, Rodriguez-Abreu, 986 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nat 583, no one  having suggested that there is  any extrinsic\r\n\nevidence  that  reveals  the  actual  intent  of  the  plan's\r\n\ndrafters.    See  Restatement  (Second),  Contracts    212(2)\r                                                               \r\n\n(1979).   The  difficulty is  that the  plan language  can be\r\n\nplausibly read either way.   Nor is this surprising  since in\r\n\nall  likelihood the  plan drafters,  in completing  what were\r\n\nlargely boilerplate  provisions, never had occasion  to think\r\n\nabout the variation we confront in this case.\r\n\n     On  the  one  hand, the  plan  specifies  the  6 percent\r\n\nfigure,  surely  with ongoing  plan  operations  in mind  but\r\n\nwithout specifically excluding a lump sum paid on termination\r\n\nof  the plan.  On the  other hand, termination is the subject\r\n\nof a  separate article;  the  article refers  to a  statutory\r\n\nprovision; and  an associated regulation provides  that those\r\n\nterminating  the plan shall select a reasonable rate.  So far\r\n\nas  bare language goes, the choice between the Cooke and Lynn\r\n\nreadings  is practically a coin  flip; and the  usual saws of\r\n\ninterpretation--such as \"the specific controls the general\"--\r\n\ncould be invoked by either side. \r\n\n     Thus, another perspective must be sought.  One might ask\r\n\nhow the plan drafters would have resolved the problem if they\r\n\nhad  focused upon it, see  Prudential Ins. Co.  of America v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGray  Mfg.

On this  basis Lynn's\r                             \r\n\ninterpretation is  superior.   Plan termination is  a drastic\r\n\nand unique event; and for  that occasion the PBGC  regulation\r\n\nprovides   a  detailed  regime  for  selecting  a  reasonable\r\n\ninterest  rate.   A  reading of  the  plan that  leaves  that\r\n\nsubject   solely  to   the  regulation   is  straightforward,\r\n\nworkable,  and far less likely to result in a tension between\r\n\nthe plan and the regulation.  \r\n\n     Further, it is hard to see how substantial injustice can\r\n\nbe  done to the beneficiary  if the trustees  are confined to\r\n\nchoosing  a \"reasonable rate.\"   By contrast, insistence on a\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nfixed rate can easily  produce anomalies such as  the alleged\r\n\ndouble  recovery that  might be  available  to Cooke  in this\r\n\ncase;  and,  as  Lynn points  out,  it  could  easily be  the\r\n\nbeneficiary who  suffered from a very small  lump sum payment\r\n\nif  the  plan's  contract  rate  happened  to  be  too  high.\r\n\nFinally,  letting the  PBGC regulation  govern increases  the\r\n\nlikelihood that the trustees will afford a lump sum option to\r\n\nthe employee in the first place.2  \r\n\n     One might  argue that  any ambiguity  in  an ERISA  plan\r\n\nshould  be resolved in favor  of the beneficiary.   We take a\r\n\nmore  agnostic view of the statute.  Beneficiaries come first\r\n\non  the priority list but only  to the extent of the benefits\r\n\ndue them;  and the statute expressly permits  the employer to\r\n\nreclaim  the  surplus, if  the plan  so  permits (as  it does\r\n\nhere).   29 U.S.C.     1344(d).   Such plans  should be  read\r\n\nfairly, but not  automatically to maximize  the award to  the\r\n\nbeneficiary.   Foltz v.

Or,  a plan could explicitly provide\r\n\nthat  a  specified   interest  rate  is   to  be  used   upon\r                   \r\n\ntermination, or--conversely--that the trustees on termination\r\n\nmay select any  reasonable rate.  Any  plan that faces up  to\r                          \r\n\nthe problem can avoid the ambiguity encountered here.\r\n\n     We  have considered whether there is a need for trial on\r\n\nthe question whether the  trustees in this instance acted  in\r\n\nbad  faith,  as originally  alleged by  Cooke.   The district\r\n\ncourt did not find it necessary  to pass on this issue which,\r\n\nwere  a ruling on it subject  to appeal, would be reviewed de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo.  After examining the summary judgment filings, we think\r                \r\n\nthat Cooke's papers  do not generate a  trial-worthy issue on\r\n\nthe charge of bad  faith.  Accordingly, we conclude  that the\r\n\ngrant  of  summary judgment  in favor  of  Cooke must  be set\r\n\naside, and that Lynn  is entitled to summary judgment  in its\r\n\nfavor.\r\n\n     The  judgment is  reversed  and the  case remanded  with\r                                                                   \r\n\ndirections to enter summary judgment in favor of Lynn.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n",

On May  18,  1983,  Trimount  Bituminous\r\n\nProducts  Co. (\"Trimount\")  purchased Lynn  Sand &amp;  Stone Co.\r\n\n(\"Lynn\").   At the time of the purchase, Lynn had in place an\r\n\nemployer-sponsored, defined-benefit  pension plan.   The plan\r\n\nwas subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\r\n\n1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C.   1001 et seq.\r                                                    \r\n\n     At  the time of the  purchase, in May  1983, James Cooke\r\n\nwas president and treasurer of Lynn and also a trustee of the\r\n\nplan.  Shortly thereafter, Cooke was terminated as an officer\r\n\nunder circumstances not entirely to  his credit, see Cooke v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nLynn Sand &amp; Stone Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(Mass. 1994), and later\r                                 \r\n\nin the year Lynn replaced the  trustees of the plan and voted\r\n\nto terminate  it.  Article XIV of  the plan permitted Lynn to\r\n\namend or terminate the plan at any time.\r\n\n     The  proposed termination  required  a clearance  by the\r\n\nPension  Benefit Guaranty  Corporation (\"PBGC\"),  the federal\r\n\nagency that insures ERISA-covered pension plans and regulates\r\n\nterminations.

The\r\n\npresent litigation  presents the question how  much Cooke was\r\n\nentitled to receive on termination of the plan.\r\n\n     In 1983 Cooke--who was then 53 years of age--had accrued\r\n\na monthly retirement benefit of $1,856.93, starting at age 65\r\n\nand continuing  for ten years  or until his  death, whichever\r\n\ncame  first.   The  plan  permitted  the  trustees  to  offer\r\n\nbeneficiaries  an option,  in  lieu of  monthly payments,  of\r\n\nreceiving a lump sum  distribution of equal value.   Choosing\r\n\nto  offer this option to Cooke, the trustees had to determine\r\n\nthe   present  value   of  the  promised   monthly  payments.\r\n\nMortality  assumptions aside,  this required  selection  of a\r\n\n\"discount\"  rate--effectively  an  assumed interest  rate--to\r\n\ncompute  a present lump sum  equal to the  stream of promised\r\n\nfuture  payments.     See  Robert  Anthony   &amp;  James  Reece,\r                                     \r\n\nAccounting Principles 199-203 (1983).\r                                 \r\n\n     The trustees  retained an actuarial  firm which  advised\r\n\nthat, if the trustees  chose to offer lump sum  payments, the\r\n\nappropriate choice  of rates  was between the  PBGC-specified\r\n\ninterest rate of  9.5 percent1 or a somewhat  higher interest\r\n\nrate  of  11 to  11.5  percent,  reflecting the  figure  that\r\n\ncertain insurance companies  would employ  if Lynn  purchased\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The 9.5 percent figure appeared  in a PBGC schedule for\r\ncalculating lump-sum values of  annuities as of a  given plan\r\ntermination  date.   See  29 C.F.R.     2619, App.  B (1986),\r                                    \r\nsetting forth a 9.5 percent rate for plans terminated between\r\nSeptember 1, 1983 and February 1, 1984. \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nannuities instead of  providing lump  sums.   The higher  the\r\n\nrate selected, the  smaller will  be the lump  sum needed  to\r\n\nequal the future stream of payments.  Ultimately, the actuary\r\n\nrecommended the  9.5 percent figure, stating  later that this\r\n\nwas the actuary's best judgment as to the proper rate as well\r\n\nas the rate then commonly used on termination of a plan under\r\n\nERISA.\r\n\n     The use of the  9.5 percent figure equated to a lump sum\r\n\npayment for Cooke of  $58,987.98.  Cooke's attorneys disputed\r\n\nthis computation,  urging (based  on certain language  in the\r\n\nplan yet  to be described)  that a  6 percent rate  should be\r\n\nused; on this premise,  Cooke would have obtained a  lump sum\r\n\nof  $96,892.42.    The trustees  maintained  their  position.\r\n\nUltimately,  the  PBGC issued  a  notice  in September  1984,\r\n\nfinding  that the assets of  the plan would  be sufficient to\r\n\ncover  all guaranteed benefits  and rejecting without comment\r\n\nCooke's objections as to the rate selected.\r\n\n     On  June 14,  1985,  Cooke  filed  a  complaint  in  the\r\n\ndistrict court, contending inter alia that the use of the 9.5\r                                                 \r\n\npercent interest rate violated  the plan and therefore ERISA.\r\n\nCross-motions  for  summary  judgment  were  filed,  and  the\r\n\ndistrict court issued an initial  non-dispositive decision in\r\n\nJuly 1986, relying in part on the trustees' interpretation of\r\n\nthe plan.

Mass. 1994).\r                                   \r\n\nDefendants in the district court--Lynn, Trimount and the plan\r\n\ntrustees  (collectively  \"Lynn\")--have now  appealed, arguing\r\n\nthat their interpretation deserves weight and is in any event\r\n\ncorrect.       Cooke's  main  argument  in  favor  of  the  6\r\n\npercent rate, adopted  by the district  court, was that  this\r\n\nrate was mandated by  the plan and was not  inconsistent with\r\n\nPBGC regulations.   The plan states in article  I,   22, that\r\n\n\"[f]or  purposes  of   establishing  actuarial   equivalence,\r\n\npresent value  shall be determined by  discounting all future\r\n\npayments for interest and mortality on the basis specified in\r\n\nthe [plan's] Adoption Agreement.\"  Section 1.09 of the plan's\r\n\nadoption agreement, a boilerplate form with checked boxes and\r\n\ninserted  figures, provides  that  in establishing  actuarial\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nequivalence  the  figure  of 6  percent  should  be used  for\r\n\n\"[p]re-retirement interest.\"\r\n\n     In  response,  Lynn  has   argued  that  the  6  percent\r\n\nprovision  applies where a lump sum is paid under the ongoing\r\n\nplan but does not apply to termination payments.  Lynn points\r\n\nto article  XIV,   2, of  the plan, which states  that in the\r\n\nevent of termination, the trustee must \"allocate the [plan's]\r\n\nassets\"  in accordance with 29  U.S.C.   1344.   Section 1344\r\n\nprovides a  mandatory priority schedule for  plan payments on\r\n\ntermination.  Incident to  this and other sections  of ERISA,\r\n\nthe  PBGC has  established regulations  that address  in some\r\n\ndetail the determination of  the interest rate to be  used in\r\n\nlump sum computations when a plan is terminated.\r\n\n     The key  regulation, 29  C.F.R.   2619.26,  is concerned\r\n\nwith the valuing of a lump sum paid in lieu of normal monthly\r\n\nretirement benefits  where a plan's assets  are sufficient to\r\n\ncover all  of its  statutory obligations under  section 1344.\r\n\nThe  regulation  requires the  use  of \"reasonable  actuarial\r\n\nassumptions  as to  interest and  mortality\"; it  directs the\r\n\nplan administrator  to specify  the assumptions  when seeking\r\n\ntermination clearance from the PBGC; it makes the assumptions\r\n\nsubject to PBGC  review and to  re-evaluation of benefits  if\r\n\nthe assumptions  are found unreasonable  by the PBGC;  and it\r\n\nsets forth four \"interest  assumptions\" that are \"among those\r\n\nthat will normally be considered reasonable\":\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     (i)   The rate by the plan for determining lump sum\r\n     amounts  prior to  the date  of termination.   This\r\n     rate may  appear in  the plan documents  or may  be\r\n     inferred from recent plan practice.\r\n     (ii)    The  rate  used   by  the  insurer  in  the\r\n     qualifying  bid under which  the plan administrator\r\n     will purchase  annuities not  being paid as  a lump\r\n     sum. . . .\r\n     (iii)    The interest  rate  used  for the  minimum\r\n     funding standard account pursuant to section 302 of\r\n     the Act and section  412(b) of the Internal Revenue\r\n     Code.\r\n     (iv)     The  PBGC  interest  rate   for  immediate\r\n     annuities in effect on the valuation date set forth\r\n     in Appendix B to this part.\r\n\n     Based  on  this  language,  Lynn argues  that  the  plan\r\n\ntrustees were  entitled to  select any reasonable  rate, that\r\n\nthe 9.5 percent PBGC rate actually adopted is one of the four\r\n\n\"normally . . . considered reasonable\" under  the regulation,\r\n\nand that  the evidence of the actuary hired by Lynn shows the\r\n\n9.5  percent figure was certainly reasonable here.  As to the\r\n\nplan  and adoption agreement, Lynn argues  that the 6 percent\r\n\nprovision  does not apply to  terminations or, if intended to\r\n\napply, is overridden by the regulation.\r\n\n     We start  with the  regulation because, if  so intended,\r\n\nthere is little  doubt that it  would override contrary  plan\r\n\nprovisions.   See 29 U.S.C.   1341(a); 29 C.F.R.   2619.3(a).\r                             \r\n\nGiven the wording  of the regulation and  its likely purpose,\r\n\nwe agree that section  2619.26 would override any contractual\r\n\nprovision   providing  for   a   rate  that   proved  to   be\r\n\n\"unreasonable\" under the regulation.  But the  reasonableness\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nor unreasonableness of the 6 percent figure cannot readily be\r\n\ndetermined on the present state of the record.\r\n\n     Although  the  district  court  deemed  the  6   percent\r\n\ninterest rate reasonable, apparently  because it was the rate\r\n\nspecified  in the plan, the regulation does no more than make\r\n\nthe  plan  rate  used   prior  to  termination  presumptively\r\n\nreasonable.  Further, it  appears from the record that  the 6\r\n\npercent interest rate would generate a lump sum sufficient to\r\n\nbuy  two  annuities,  each  separately  providing  Cooke  the\r                    \r\n\npromised  monthly payments.   Thus,  it is  at least  open to\r\n\nquestion whether  the 6  percent figure is  reasonable.   The\r\n\nrecord does show that the  9.5 percent figure is reasonable--\r\n\nindeed,  arguably generous  to Cooke--but  there can  be more\r\n\nthan one reasonable rate.\r\n\n     If we  assume arguendo that  6 percent  is a  reasonable\r                                                             \r\n\nrate and that the  plan intended it to apply  on termination,\r                                                                        \r\n\nwe see no reason why the plan  could not require the trustees\r\n\nto use  that rate.  It  is true that the  regulation might be\r\n\nread  to reserve  the  choice of  a  reasonable rate  to  the\r\n\ntrustees on  termination, regardless  of what the  plan says.\r\n\nBut the  regulation's language does not  compel that reading,\r\n\nand Lynn  does not show that  such a reading would  serve any\r\n\npurpose; after all, the PBGC can reject a plan-specified rate\r\n\nif the PBGC finds the rate unreasonable.  \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     We turn therefore  to the  contractual question  whether\r\n\nthe  plan should  be read  to require  use  of the  6 percent\r\n\nfigure not only in calculating lump sums paid during the life\r\n\nof the plan  but also lump  sums paid upon termination.

Lynn  does point  to\r\n\nsome plan  language marginally helpful to  its position, but,\r\n\non  balance, we agree with  the district judge  who took over\r\n\nthe  case after  Firestone that  the  plan language  does not\r                                      \r\n\nsatisfy Firestone.

The  difficulty is  that the  plan language  can be\r\n\nplausibly read either way.   Nor is this surprising  since in\r\n\nall  likelihood the  plan drafters,  in completing  what were\r\n\nlargely boilerplate  provisions, never had occasion  to think\r\n\nabout the variation we confront in this case.\r\n\n     On  the  one  hand, the  plan  specifies  the  6 percent\r\n\nfigure,  surely  with ongoing  plan  operations  in mind  but\r\n\nwithout specifically excluding a lump sum paid on termination\r\n\nof  the plan.  On the  other hand, termination is the subject\r\n\nof a  separate article;  the  article refers  to a  statutory\r\n\nprovision; and  an associated regulation provides  that those\r\n\nterminating  the plan shall select a reasonable rate.  So far\r\n\nas  bare language goes, the choice between the Cooke and Lynn\r\n\nreadings  is practically a coin  flip; and the  usual saws of\r\n\ninterpretation--such as \"the specific controls the general\"--\r\n\ncould be invoked by either side. \r\n\n     Thus, another perspective must be sought.

On this  basis Lynn's\r                             \r\n\ninterpretation is  superior.   Plan termination is  a drastic\r\n\nand unique event; and for  that occasion the PBGC  regulation\r\n\nprovides   a  detailed  regime  for  selecting  a  reasonable\r\n\ninterest  rate.   A  reading of  the  plan that  leaves  that\r\n\nsubject   solely  to   the  regulation   is  straightforward,\r\n\nworkable,  and far less likely to result in a tension between\r\n\nthe plan and the regulation.  \r\n\n     Further, it is hard to see how substantial injustice can\r\n\nbe  done to the beneficiary  if the trustees  are confined to\r\n\nchoosing  a \"reasonable rate.\"   By contrast, insistence on a\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nfixed rate can easily  produce anomalies such as  the alleged\r\n\ndouble  recovery that  might be  available  to Cooke  in this\r\n\ncase;  and,  as  Lynn points  out,  it  could  easily be  the\r\n\nbeneficiary who  suffered from a very small  lump sum payment\r\n\nif  the  plan's  contract  rate  happened  to  be  too  high.\r\n\nFinally,  letting the  PBGC regulation  govern increases  the\r\n\nlikelihood that the trustees will afford a lump sum option to\r\n\nthe employee in the first place.2  \r\n\n     One might  argue that  any ambiguity  in  an ERISA  plan\r\n\nshould  be resolved in favor  of the beneficiary.   We take a\r\n\nmore  agnostic view of the statute.  Beneficiaries come first\r\n\non  the priority list but only  to the extent of the benefits\r\n\ndue them;  and the statute expressly permits  the employer to\r\n\nreclaim  the  surplus, if  the plan  so  permits (as  it does\r\n\nhere).   29 U.S.C.     1344(d).   Such plans  should be  read\r\n\nfairly, but not  automatically to maximize  the award to  the\r\n\nbeneficiary.   Foltz v.

It  could easily  be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Of  course, a  fixed figure  might be desirable  in the\r\ncontext of an ongoing plan, simply  for the sake of speed and\r\ncertainty; but in that context, there  is no PBGC requirement\r\nthat the specified figure be reasonable and no  potential for\r\nconflict between the  plan and the regulation where  the plan\r\nfigure is arguably unreasonable.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nresolved  under  a plan  that  explicitly  gave the  trustees\r\n\nauthority  to  interpret  in  terms  that   meet  Firestone's\r                                                                       \r\n\ndelegation requirement.  Or,  a plan could explicitly provide\r\n\nthat  a  specified   interest  rate  is   to  be  used   upon\r                   \r\n\ntermination, or--conversely--that the trustees on termination\r\n\nmay select any  reasonable rate.  Any  plan that faces up  to\r                          \r\n\nthe problem can avoid the ambiguity encountered here.\r\n\n     We  have considered whether there is a need for trial on\r\n\nthe question whether the  trustees in this instance acted  in\r\n\nbad  faith,  as originally  alleged by  Cooke.   The district\r\n\ncourt did not find it necessary  to pass on this issue which,\r\n\nwere  a ruling on it subject  to appeal, would be reviewed de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo.  After examining the summary judgment filings, we think\r                \r\n\nthat Cooke's papers  do not generate a  trial-worthy issue on\r\n\nthe charge of bad  faith.  Accordingly, we conclude  that the\r\n\ngrant  of  summary judgment  in favor  of  Cooke must  be set\r\n\naside, and that Lynn  is entitled to summary judgment  in its\r\n\nfavor.\r\n\n     The  judgment is  reversed  and the  case remanded  with\r                                                                   \r\n\ndirections to enter summary judgment in favor of Lynn.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n</pre>",
