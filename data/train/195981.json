The  Interstate\n\nCommerce Commission (\"ICC\") granted the exemption.  Berkshire\n\nScenic Railway  Museum,  Inc. (\"Berkshire\"),  which owns  and\n\noperates  a  museum in  a  historic railroad  station  on the\n\nCanaan  Secondary  Branch  in  Lenox,  Massachusetts  (\"Lenox\n\nstation\"), petitioned  the ICC to declare  the exemption void\n\nab  initio,  contending  that  it  was  based  on  false  and\r                      \n\nmisleading information.  The  ICC denied Berkshire's petition\n\nand Berkshire now seeks our review of the ICC's decision.  We\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n          The background to this dispute involves the history\n\nof Berkshire,  details of the Housatonic-B&amp;M transaction, and\n\nintricacies of ICC acquisition-approval regulations.  A brief\n\ndiscussion follows.  \n\n          Pursuant to a series of annual agreements with B&amp;M,\n\nBerkshire operated a scenic railway line on a portion of B&amp;M-\n\nowned track between  the Massachusetts-Connecticut border and\n\nPittsfield,   Massachusetts.      Berkshire,   a   non-profit\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\norganization,  used the  revenue from  the scenic  railway to\n\nfund  the  renovation of  the  Lenox  station.1   The  scenic\n\nrailway  operated for  six  years, from  1984 through  1989.2\n\nFrom  1984-1988,  Berkshire's   trains  operated  from   Lee,\n\nMassachusetts to Great Barrington,  Massachusetts.  In  1989,\n\nBerkshire  used the Lenox station as the locus for the scenic\n\nrailway.  \n\n          Meanwhile,  B&amp;M allowed  the track  to deteriorate.\n\nSensing  opportunity,  Housatonic   sought  to  extend  their\n\nalready  existing freight-line operations along the B&amp;M-owned\n\ntrack   in  Massachusetts.    Negotiations  between  B&amp;M  and\n\nHousatonic led  to agreement and, in  November 1990, pursuant\n\nto  49 U.S.C.   10505, Housatonic filed a petition seeking an\n\nexemption from  the ICC's certification requirements  for the\n\nacquisition and operation of the rail line.3\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Constructed  in 1902, the Lenox  station was added to the\nNational Register of Historic Places (\"National Register\") in\n1989.\n\n2.  The  record  suggests  that by  1989,  the  B&amp;M-Berkshire\nrelationship had deteriorated  significantly.  B&amp;M  chose not\nto renew its agreement with Berkshire.\n\n3.  Noncarriers seeking  to acquire  a rail line  must secure\nregulatory approval from the  ICC.  Housatonic Track Company,\nInc.,  was  a noncarrier  for  purposes  of the  regulations.\nPursuant   to  49  U.S.C.     10901,  the  ICC  may  issue  a\ncertificate    of    public   convenience    and   necessity.\nAlternatively, 49 U.S.C.   10505 authorizes exemptions from  \n10901's  formal  certification  process if  the  exemption is\nneeded to  advance \"rail transportation policy.\"   Under this\nauthority, the  ICC has  exempted so-called  \"acquisition and\noperation\" applications, such as Housatonic's, from the full-\nblown certification process.  See generally Pittsburgh &amp; Lake\r                                                                         \n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          As   part   of   the  exemption-approval   process,\n\nHousatonic   advised   the   Massachusetts   State   Historic\n\nPreservation Officer  (\"SHPO\") that they  intended to acquire\n\nand operate  the line  as  a freight  operation.   Housatonic\n\nrequested the SHPO to advise the ICC of any objections to the\n\ntransaction.  In their letter to the SHPO,  Housatonic stated\n\nthat \"the property  to be  acquired is now  used for  freight\n\nrailroad  service and will  continue to  be used  for freight\n\nrailroad  service.   No change  of use  is contemplated.   No\n\nbuildings  whatsoever  are  located  on the  property  to  be\n\nacquired.\"  In  fact, a  small portion of  the Lenox  station\n\nencroaches  on the  railroad right-of-way.   At  the time  of\n\ntheir letter to the SHPO, however, Housatonic did not know of\n\nthe encroachment.  \n\n          On December 17, 1990, the SHPO wrote a no-objection\n\nletter to the ICC.  The  SHPO noted that there were  historic\n\nstructures  or  multiple  historic  districts  and properties\n\neither  listed  or  eligible  for  listing  on  the  National\n\nRegister  adjacent  to or  within  the proposed  route.   She\n\nnonetheless concluded that \"this  project will have no effect\n\non    the    significant    architectural   and    historical\n\ncharacteristics   of   these    [historic   properties    and\n\ndistricts].\"  The SHPO did not specifically mention the Lenox\n\n                    \r                                \n\nErie R.R. v.

Berkshire   did  not  comment   to  the  ICC   on\n\nHousatonic's exemption petition.\n\n          In  an  order  dated  December 21,  1990,  the  ICC\n\ndismissed    Housatonic's    exemption   petition,    instead\n\ndetermining  that   they  qualified  for  a  so-called  class\n\nexemption.4     Thus,  the  ICC  authorized   the  Housatonic\n\nacquisition.5   The ICC  decision did not  explicitly address\n\nhistoric preservation.  \n\n          Prior  to the  acquisition, Housatonic  had assured\n\nBerkshire that Berkshire could  operate the scenic railway on\n\nthe  tracks.   Subsequent  to the  acquisition, however,  the\n\nparties were unable to reach  an agreement.  Berkshire claims\n\nthat  without  revenue from  the  scenic  railway, it  cannot\n\ncontinue to renovate the Lenox  station or educate the public\n\nabout railroading, thus frustrating its mission.  Following\n\nthe failure in negotiations,  Berkshire petitioned the ICC to\n\nrevoke Housatonic's exemption, arguing that the ICC had acted\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  Under      10505,   the   ICC   has  exempted   so-called\n\"acquisition  and operation\"  applications, as a  class, from\nthe full-blown certification process.   See Pittsburgh &amp; Lake\r                                                                         \nErie R.R., 491 U.S. at 499-500.\r                     \n\n5.  Regulations appearing  at 49  C.F.R.   1150.32  set forth\nthe procedure by which the ICC grants   10505 acquisition and\noperation exemptions.   First, an applicant  files a verified\nnotice of  exemption.   The exemption then  becomes effective\nseven  days after filing and will be published in the Federal\nRegister within 30 days  after filing.  An exemption  will be\nvoid ab initio  if the applicant's  notice contains false  or\r                          \nmisleading information.   49 C.F.R.    1150.32 (a)-(c).   Any\nperson  opposing  the transaction  must  file  a petition  to\nrevoke.  49 U.S.C.   10505(d).\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\non   the   basis  of   false  and   misleading  information.6\n\nBerkshire  also asserted that  the ICC had  failed to perform\n\nadequate historic preservation  and environmental  assessment\n\nanalyses.   Finally,  it  argued  that  the ICC  should  have\n\nconditioned any  exemption on the requirement that Housatonic\n\nallow  Berkshire to  operate  the scenic  railway.   After an\n\nextended  review,  the   ICC  denied  Berkshire's   petition.\n\nBerkshire then sought review by this court.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n          In this proceeding,  Berkshire makes two  principal\n\narguments:  (1)  Housatonic's allegedly false  and misleading\n\nstatements to the SHPO should  render their exemption void ab\r                                                                         \n\ninitio;  and  (2)  the  ICC's  failure  to  conduct  adequate\r                  \n\nhistoric  preservation and environmental  reviews requires it\n\nto  conduct  new  reviews.    We  find  no  merit  in  either\n\ncontention.    After  reciting  the standard  of  review,  we\n\ndiscuss each argument in turn.\n\nA.  Standard of Review\r                                  \n\n          We  accord broad  deference  to  ICC  decisions  to\n\nexempt transactions from  the ICA.   We will  uphold the  ICC\n\ndecision unless  it was  \"arbitrary, capricious, an  abuse of\n\ndiscretion, or  otherwise not  in  accordance with  law.\"   5\n\nU.S.C.    706(2)(A); see also  CMC Real Estate  Corp. v.

We\r                                                                    \n\ndo not agree.  \n\n          As noted above, see  supra note 5, under applicable\r                                                \n\nICC regulations, an exemption is void ab initio if the notice\r                                                           \n\nof exemption  contains false or misleading  information.  The\n\nICC  has  interpreted the  regulation  to  require that  such\n\ninformation  concern  a \"material\"  part of  the transaction.\n\nMendocino Coast Ry., Inc., 1988 WL 224486, at *3 (I.C.C. July\r                                     \n\n14,  1988).   A statement  is material  if, for  example, the\n\ntransaction   would  not  have  otherwise  qualified  for  an\n\nexemption.    Sagamore Nat'l  Corp.,  1994 WL  487580,  at *2\r                                               \n\n(I.C.C. Sept. 9, 1994).    \n\n          Berkshire      contends      that      Housatonic's\n\nrepresentations  to  the   SHPO  contained  three  false   or\n\nmisleading  statements.7    The  substance  of   the  alleged\n\n                    \r                                \n\n7.  For purposes of this appeal, we assume but do not decide,\nthat \"false  or misleading information\" provided  to the SHPO\nrather than contained  in the notice  of exemption itself  is\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nmisrepresentations, derived from  Housatonic's letter  quoted\n\nabove, are:   (1) no buildings are located on the property to\n\nbe   acquired;  (2)  no  change   in  use  of   the  line  is\n\ncontemplated; and  (3) the property is now  and will continue\n\nto  be used for freight service.  Berkshire argues that these\n\nstatements misrepresented the facts because:  (1) in light of\n\nits  encroachment onto  the railway  right-of-way, the  Lenox\n\nstation  is, in fact,  located on the  acquired property; and\n\n(2) Housatonic did not  disclose that they would subsequently\n\nrefuse to allow Berkshire to operate the scenic railway.    \n\n            In lieu  of  the ICC's  materiality  requirement,\n\nBerkshire advocates a literal reading of the regulation:  any\r                                                                         \n\nfalse or  misleading information should lead  to an exemption\n\nbeing  void  ab  initio.    However,  we  accord  substantial\r                                   \n\ndeference   to   an  agency's   interpretation  of   its  own\n\nregulations, see,  e.g., Reich v. Simpson,  Gumpertz &amp; Heger,\r                                                                         \n\nInc., 3 F.3d  1, 2  (1st Cir.  1993), and  Berkshire has  not\r                \n\npersuaded us that, on  these facts, that deference should  be\n\ndisplaced.   Accordingly, we see no reason to depart from the\n\nICC's materiality  requirement.  Moreover, the  ICC had ample\n\nbasis to conclude that Housatonic's statements fall far short\n\nof the materiality requirement.  With specific regard to  the\n\nstation-encroachment  issue, the ICC  found that Housatonic's\n\nrepresentations   were   \"immaterial  misstatements.\"     Had\n\n                    \r                                \n\nsufficient to render the exemption void ab initio.  \r                                                             \n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nHousatonic represented  the facts as they  actually were, the\n\ntransaction would have still  qualified for a class exemption\n\nbecause  historic  preservation  is  simply  not  a  material\n\nelement of  an \"acquisition  and operation\" transaction.   We\n\nalso note that, as a practical matter, there is nothing about\n\nthe acquisition itself that could have adversely affected the\n\nportion of the  station on the right-of-way.  Housatonic only\n\nproposed to operate  railroad freight  service, presumably  a\n\nfamiliar  activity on  the tracks  for most of  the station's\n\nnearly ninety-year existence. \n\n          Berkshire's  second  contention --  that Housatonic\n\ndid not disclose that they would subsequently refuse to allow\n\nBerkshire to operate the  scenic railway -- rests on  an even\n\nshakier footing.   Not  only is  an agreement  with Berkshire\n\nimmaterial  to a class exemption, but there is nothing in the\n\nICA  requiring  Housatonic  to  allow Berkshire  to  use  the\n\ntracks. \n\n          In short,  because we find that  Housatonic did not\n\nproffer \"false  or misleading information\" within the meaning\n\nof  that  phrase  as  interpreted by  the  ICC,  Housatonic's\n\nexemption is not  void ab  initio under 49  C.F.R.    1150.32\r                                             \n\n(c).\n\nC.  The ICC's Historic Preservation and Environmental Reviews\r                                                                         \n\n          Berkshire  next  argues  that  the  ICC  failed  to\n\nconduct  necessary  historic  preservation and  environmental\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nreviews.   On review, we think the record provides a rational\n\nbasis for the ICC's disposition.\n\n          Section 106  of the National  Historic Preservation\n\nAct requires that a federal licensing agency shall, prior  to\n\nthe issuance of a  license, \"take into account the  effect of\n\nthe undertaking  on any district, site,  building, structure,\n\nor  object that is included  in or eligible  for inclusion in\n\nthe  National  Register.\"    11 U.S.C.     470f.   Applicable\n\nregulations,  appearing  at  36  C.F.R.    800.9,  set  forth\n\nvarious  \"adverse effect\"  criteria to  be considered  by the\n\nfederal   entity.8     Berkshire  argues   that  Housatonic's\n\nacquisition  is inconsistent  with  two such  criteria:   (1)\n\n\"[i]solation  of  the  property  from or  alteration  of  the\n\ncharacter  of  the  property's setting  when  that  character\n\ncontributes to the property's qualification  for the National\n\nRegister\"; and (2)  \"[n]eglect of a property resulting in its\n\ndeterioration or destruction.\"  36  C.F.R.   800.9(b)(2) &amp;   \n\n800.9(b)(4).    Berkshire reasons  that,  because  it may  no\n\nlonger operate the scenic railway, the  Lenox station is both\n\n\"functionally isolated\" (Berkshire's phrase) from its setting\n\nas well as deprived of revenues for the station's renovation,\n\nthus leading to its \"deterioration.\"   Accordingly, Berkshire\n\n                    \r                                \n\n8.  If an adverse effect exists, then  the federal agency, in\nconsultation with  state officials, must \"seek  ways to avoid\nor reduce the effects\"  on historic properties.  36  C.F.R.  \n800.5(e).  \n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nargues, the petition  should be  remanded for  a full  review\n\nunder  Section 106.  Berkshire also argues that any exemption\n\nshould  be conditioned  on  Housatonic's agreement  to  allow\n\nBerkshire to use the line.\n\n          Even  in a charitable  light, Berkshire's arguments\n\nstrain credulity.  As  to Berkshire's first contention, there\n\nis  no  basis   for  a  claim  of  isolation,  functional  or\n\notherwise.   At least three factors  support this conclusion.\n\nFirst,  as  noted  above,  largely  because  of  an  apparent\n\nbreakdown  in  the  B&amp;M-Berkshire  relationship,  the  scenic\n\nrailway had  not operated for more  than a year prior  to the\n\nHousatonic acquisition.   At  most, therefore, the  effect of\n\nthe Housatonic transaction on the then-non-functioning scenic\n\nrailway was to perpetuate the status quo.  In other words, we\n\nfind  no basis to conclude that  the Housatonic exemption led\n\nto the \"isolation\" Berkshire claims has resulted.  Second, as\n\nthe ICC notes, the  SHPO issued a no-effect letter,  in which\n\nneither Lenox station nor  the scenic railway were discussed.\n\nThird,  we think that Berkshire's  claim of \"isolation  . . .\n\nfrom the property's setting\"  is facially implausible in view\n\nof  the  fact that  the historic  property  in question  -- a\n\nrailway  station  -- abuts  and, indeed,  actually encroaches\n\nupon an active railroad right-of-way.\n\n          Berkshire's  \"deterioration\" argument  is similarly\n\nunavailing.   Whatever \"deterioration\" might have flowed from\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nthe  cessation of the scenic railway was not an effect caused\n\nby  Housatonic's  exemption.    As noted  above,  the  scenic\n\nrailway  had  ceased  operating  well  before  the Housatonic\n\nacquisition.    Moreover, as  the  ICC  notes, a  substantial\n\nquestion exists  as to whether  it has jurisdiction  to grant\n\nthe  relief  Berkshire seeks  --  that  is, conditioning  any\n\nexemption  on Berkshire's right to use the track.  Because we\n\nfind  that the exemption gives rise to no adverse effects, we\n\nneed not reach the jurisdictional issue.\n\n          Finally, Berkshire argues that the ICC should  have\n\nrequired an  environmental assessment  of the effects  of the\n\nacquisition.   Again, we do  not agree.   Under then-existing\n\nregulations,   the  ICC   did   not   require   environmental\n\nassessments when  there was  \"only a  change in  ownership or\n\nsimilar   changes;   such  as   issuance  of   securities  or\n\nreorganization,  but  not  involving  a  change   in  carrier\n\noperations.\"  49  C.F.R.     1105.6(c)(2) (1990).    The  ICC\n\nreasoned that because no operational changes were involved in\n\nthe Housatonic transaction, an  assessment was not  required.\n\nBerkshire,   however,   points   to   another   then-existing\n\nregulation under which an assessment would normally have been\n\nrequired   when  the   proposed   transaction   involved   an\n\n\"abandonment,   acquisition,  or  operation   of  a  line  of\n\nrailroad.\"    49 C.F.R.     1105.6(b)(1)  (1990).   Berkshire\n\nargues that, by its terms, the former   1105.6(c)(2) does not\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\napply  to an  acquisition  and  operation  of  a  line  by  a\n\ndifferent entity and, in any event, the former   1105.6(b)(1)\n\ndirectly applies.  In its denial of Berkshire's petition, the\n\nICC  indicated that  the former  regulation applied.   Before\n\nthis  court, the  ICC concedes  that either  regulation could\n\napply to  the transaction.   Inasmuch as the  transaction did\n\nnot involve a  significant change in operations on the track,\n\nwe  conclude  the  ICC did  have  a  rational  basis for  not\n\nrequiring an environmental assessment.\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n          For the  foregoing  reasons, the  decision  of  the\n\nInterstate Commerce Commission is\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed.\r                              \n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n",

(jointly, \"Housatonic\"), sought an exemption from the Interstate Commerce Act (\"ICA\") to permit their acquisition and operation of a rail line in Massachusetts and Connecticut, known as the Canaan Secondary Branch, then owned by the Boston and Maine Corporation (\"B &amp; M\").  The Interstate Commerce Commission (\"ICC\") granted the exemption.  Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum, Inc.  (\"Berkshire\"), which owns and operates a museum in a historic railroad station on the Canaan Secondary Branch in Lenox, Massachusetts (\"Lenox station\"), petitioned the ICC to declare the exemption void ab initio, contending that it was based on false and misleading information.  The ICC denied Berkshire's petition and Berkshire now seeks our review of the ICC's decision.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background to this dispute involves the history of Berkshire, details of the Housatonic-B &amp; M transaction, and intricacies of ICC acquisition-approval regulations.  A brief discussion follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to a series of annual agreements with B &amp; M, Berkshire operated a scenic railway line on a portion of B &amp; M-owned track between the Massachusetts-Connecticut border and Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Berkshire, a non-profit organization, used the revenue from the scenic railway to fund the renovation of the Lenox station.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The scenic railway operated for six years, from 1984 through 1989.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  From 1984-1988, Berkshire's trains operated from Lee, Massachusetts to Great Barrington, Massachusetts.  In 1989, Berkshire used the Lenox station as the locus for the scenic railway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, B &amp; M allowed the track to deteriorate.  Sensing opportunity, Housatonic sought to extend their already existing freight-line operations along the B &amp; M-owned track in Massachusetts.  Negotiations between B &amp; M and Housatonic led to agreement and, in November 1990, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec. 10505, Housatonic filed a petition seeking an exemption from the ICC's certification requirements for the acquisition and operation of the rail line.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the exemption-approval process, Housatonic advised the Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Officer (\"SHPO\") that they intended to acquire and operate the line as a freight operation.  Housatonic requested the SHPO to advise the ICC of any objections to the transaction.  In their letter to the SHPO, Housatonic stated that \"the property to be acquired is now used for freight railroad service and will continue to be used for freight railroad service.  No change of use is contemplated.  No buildings whatsoever are located on the property to be acquired.\"   In fact, a small portion of the Lenox station encroaches on the railroad right-of-way.  At the time of their letter to the SHPO, however, Housatonic did not know of the encroachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1990, the SHPO wrote a no-objection letter to the ICC.  The SHPO noted that there were historic structures or multiple historic districts and properties either listed or eligible for listing on the National Register adjacent to or within the proposed route.  She nonetheless concluded that \"this project will have no effect on the significant architectural and historical characteristics of these [historic properties and districts].\"  The SHPO did not specifically mention the Lenox station.  Berkshire did not comment to the ICC on Housatonic's exemption petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an order dated December 21, 1990, the ICC dismissed Housatonic's exemption petition, instead determining that they qualified for a so-called class exemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, the ICC authorized the Housatonic acquisition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The ICC decision did not explicitly address historic preservation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the acquisition, Housatonic had assured Berkshire that Berkshire could operate the scenic railway on the tracks.  Subsequent to the acquisition, however, the parties were unable to reach an agreement.  Berkshire claims that without revenue from the scenic railway, it cannot continue to renovate the Lenox station or educate the public about railroading, thus frustrating its mission.  Following the failure in negotiations, Berkshire petitioned the ICC to revoke Housatonic's exemption, arguing that the ICC had acted on the basis of false and misleading information.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Berkshire also asserted that the ICC had failed to perform adequate historic preservation and environmental assessment analyses.  Finally, it argued that the ICC should have conditioned any exemption on the requirement that Housatonic allow Berkshire to operate the scenic railway.  After an extended review, the ICC denied Berkshire's petition.  Berkshire then sought review by this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this proceeding, Berkshire makes two principal arguments:  (1) Housatonic's allegedly false and misleading statements to the SHPO should render their exemption void ab initio;  and (2) the ICC's failure to conduct adequate historic preservation and environmental reviews requires it to conduct new reviews.  We find no merit in either contention.  After reciting the standard of review, we discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accord broad deference to ICC decisions to exempt transactions from the ICA.  We will uphold the ICC decision unless it was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"  5 U.S.C. Sec. 706(2)(A);  see also CMC Real Estate Corp. v. ICC, 807 F.2d 1025, 1030 (D.C.Cir.1986);  Simmons v. ICC, 697 F.2d 326, 342 (D.C.Cir.1982).  Under this standard, our review of the ICC's action is to determine whether a \"rational basis\" for the agency's decision lies in the facts on the record.  See, e.g., Simmons, 697 F.2d at 342;  National Tour Brokers Ass'n v. ICC, 671 F.2d 528, 532 (D.C.Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>B.

We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, see supra note 5, under applicable ICC regulations, an exemption is void ab initio if the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information.  The ICC has interpreted the regulation to require that such information concern a \"material\" part of the transaction.  Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc., 1988 WL 224486, at * 3 (I.C.C. July 14, 1988).  A statement is material if, for example, the transaction would not have otherwise qualified for an exemption.  Sagamore Nat'l Corp., 1994 WL 487580, at * 2 (I.C.C. Sept. 9, 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berkshire contends that Housatonic's representations to the SHPO contained three false or misleading statements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The substance of the alleged misrepresentations, derived from Housatonic's letter quoted above, are:  (1) no buildings are located on the property to be acquired;  (2) no change in use of the line is contemplated;  and (3) the property is now and will continue to be used for freight service.  Berkshire argues that these statements misrepresented the facts because:  (1) in light of its encroachment onto the railway right-of-way, the Lenox station is, in fact, located on the acquired property;  and (2) Housatonic did not disclose that they would subsequently refuse to allow Berkshire to operate the scenic railway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In lieu of the ICC's materiality requirement, Berkshire advocates a literal reading of the regulation:  any false or misleading information should lead to an exemption being void ab initio.   However, we accord substantial deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, see, e.g., Reich v. Simpson, Gumpertz &amp; Heger, Inc., 3 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1993), and Berkshire has not persuaded us that, on these facts, that deference should be displaced.  Accordingly, we see no reason to depart from the ICC's materiality requirement.  Moreover, the ICC had ample basis to conclude that Housatonic's statements fall far short of the materiality requirement.  With specific regard to the station-encroachment issue, the ICC found that Housatonic's representations were \"immaterial misstatements.\"   Had Housatonic represented the facts as they actually were, the transaction would have still qualified for a class exemption because historic preservation is simply not a material element of an \"acquisition and operation\" transaction.  We also note that, as a practical matter, there is nothing about the acquisition itself that could have adversely affected the portion of the station on the right-of-way.  Housatonic only proposed to operate railroad freight service, presumably a familiar activity on the tracks for most of the station's nearly ninety-year existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berkshire's second contention--that Housatonic did not disclose that they would subsequently refuse to allow Berkshire to operate the scenic railway--rests on an even shakier footing.  Not only is an agreement with Berkshire immaterial to a class exemption, but there is nothing in the ICA requiring Housatonic to allow Berkshire to use the tracks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, because we find that Housatonic did not proffer \"false or misleading information\" within the meaning of that phrase as interpreted by the ICC, Housatonic's exemption is not void ab initio under 49 C.F.R. Sec. 1150.32(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>C.

Sec. 470f.  Applicable regulations, appearing at 36 C.F.R. Sec. 800.9, set forth various \"adverse effect\" criteria to be considered by the federal entity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Berkshire argues that Housatonic's acquisition is inconsistent with two such criteria:  (1) \"[i]solation of the property from or alteration of the character of the property's setting when that character contributes to the property's qualification for the National Register\";  and (2) \"[n]eglect of a property resulting in its deterioration or destruction.\"  36 C.F.R. Sec. 800.9(b)(2) &amp; Sec. 800.9(b)(4).  Berkshire reasons that, because it may no longer operate the scenic railway, the Lenox station is both \"functionally isolated\" (Berkshire's phrase) from its setting as well as deprived of revenues for the station's renovation, thus leading to its \"deterioration.\"   Accordingly, Berkshire argues, the petition should be remanded for a full review under Section 106.  Berkshire also argues that any exemption should be conditioned on Housatonic's agreement to allow Berkshire to use the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in a charitable light, Berkshire's arguments strain credulity.  As to Berkshire's first contention, there is no basis for a claim of isolation, functional or otherwise.  At least three factors support this conclusion.  First, as noted above, largely because of an apparent breakdown in the B &amp; M-Berkshire relationship, the scenic railway had not operated for more than a year prior to the Housatonic acquisition.  At most, therefore, the effect of the Housatonic transaction on the then-non-functioning scenic railway was to perpetuate the status quo.  In other words, we find no basis to conclude that the Housatonic exemption led to the \"isolation\" Berkshire claims has resulted.  Second, as the ICC notes, the SHPO issued a no-effect letter, in which neither Lenox station nor the scenic railway were discussed.  Third, we think that Berkshire's claim of \"isolation ... from the property's setting\" is facially implausible in view of the fact that the historic property in question--a railway station--abuts and, indeed, actually encroaches upon an active railroad right-of-way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berkshire's \"deterioration\" argument is similarly unavailing.  Whatever \"deterioration\" might have flowed from the cessation of the scenic railway was not an effect caused by Housatonic's exemption.  As noted above, the scenic railway had ceased operating well before the Housatonic acquisition.  Moreover, as the ICC notes, a substantial question exists as to whether it has jurisdiction to grant the relief Berkshire seeks--that is, conditioning any exemption on Berkshire's right to use the track.  Because we find that the exemption gives rise to no adverse effects, we need not reach the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Berkshire argues that the ICC should have required an environmental assessment of the effects of the acquisition.  Again, we do not agree.  Under then-existing regulations, the ICC did not require environmental assessments when there was \"only a change in ownership or similar changes;  such an issuance of securities or reorganization, but not involving a change in carrier operations.\"  49 C.F.R. Sec. 1105.6(c)(2) (1990).  The ICC reasoned that because no operational changes were involved in the Housatonic transaction, an assessment was not required.  Berkshire, however, points to another then-existing regulation under which an assessment would normally have been required when the proposed transaction involved an \"abandonment, acquisition, or operation of a line of railroad.\"  49 C.F.R. Sec. 1105.6(b)(1) (1990).  Berkshire argues that, by its terms, the former Sec. 1105.6(c)(2) does not apply to an acquisition and operation of a line by a different entity and, in any event, the former Sec. 1105.6(b)(1) directly applies.  In its denial of Berkshire's petition, the ICC indicated that the former regulation applied.  Before this court, the ICC concedes that either regulation could apply to the transaction.  Inasmuch as the transaction did not involve a significant change in operations on the track, we conclude the ICC did have a rational basis for not requiring an environmental assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Constructed in 1902, the Lenox station was added to the National Register of Historic Places (\"National Register\") in 1989</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record suggests that by 1989, the B &amp; M-Berkshire relationship had deteriorated significantly.

(jointly, \"Housatonic\"), sought an exemption from the Interstate Commerce Act (\"ICA\") to permit their acquisition and operation of a rail line in Massachusetts and Connecticut, known as the Canaan Secondary Branch, then owned by the Boston and Maine Corporation (\"B &amp; M\").  The Interstate Commerce Commission (\"ICC\") granted the exemption.  Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum, Inc.  (\"Berkshire\"), which owns and operates a museum in a historic railroad station on the Canaan Secondary Branch in Lenox, Massachusetts (\"Lenox station\"), petitioned the ICC to declare the exemption void ab initio, contending that it was based on false and misleading information.  The ICC denied Berkshire's petition and Berkshire now seeks our review of the ICC's decision.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background to this dispute involves the history of Berkshire, details of the Housatonic-B &amp; M transaction, and intricacies of ICC acquisition-approval regulations.  A brief discussion follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to a series of annual agreements with B &amp; M, Berkshire operated a scenic railway line on a portion of B &amp; M-owned track between the Massachusetts-Connecticut border and Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Berkshire, a non-profit organization, used the revenue from the scenic railway to fund the renovation of the Lenox station.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The scenic railway operated for six years, from 1984 through 1989.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  From 1984-1988, Berkshire's trains operated from Lee, Massachusetts to Great Barrington, Massachusetts.  In 1989, Berkshire used the Lenox station as the locus for the scenic railway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, B &amp; M allowed the track to deteriorate.  Sensing opportunity, Housatonic sought to extend their already existing freight-line operations along the B &amp; M-owned track in Massachusetts.  Negotiations between B &amp; M and Housatonic led to agreement and, in November 1990, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec. 10505, Housatonic filed a petition seeking an exemption from the ICC's certification requirements for the acquisition and operation of the rail line.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the exemption-approval process, Housatonic advised the Massachusetts State Historic Preservation Officer (\"SHPO\") that they intended to acquire and operate the line as a freight operation.  Housatonic requested the SHPO to advise the ICC of any objections to the transaction.  In their letter to the SHPO, Housatonic stated that \"the property to be acquired is now used for freight railroad service and will continue to be used for freight railroad service.  No change of use is contemplated.  No buildings whatsoever are located on the property to be acquired.\"   In fact, a small portion of the Lenox station encroaches on the railroad right-of-way.  At the time of their letter to the SHPO, however, Housatonic did not know of the encroachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1990, the SHPO wrote a no-objection letter to the ICC.  The SHPO noted that there were historic structures or multiple historic districts and properties either listed or eligible for listing on the National Register adjacent to or within the proposed route.  She nonetheless concluded that \"this project will have no effect on the significant architectural and historical characteristics of these [historic properties and districts].\"  The SHPO did not specifically mention the Lenox station.  Berkshire did not comment to the ICC on Housatonic's exemption petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an order dated December 21, 1990, the ICC dismissed Housatonic's exemption petition, instead determining that they qualified for a so-called class exemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, the ICC authorized the Housatonic acquisition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The ICC decision did not explicitly address historic preservation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the acquisition, Housatonic had assured Berkshire that Berkshire could operate the scenic railway on the tracks.  Subsequent to the acquisition, however, the parties were unable to reach an agreement.  Berkshire claims that without revenue from the scenic railway, it cannot continue to renovate the Lenox station or educate the public about railroading, thus frustrating its mission.  Following the failure in negotiations, Berkshire petitioned the ICC to revoke Housatonic's exemption, arguing that the ICC had acted on the basis of false and misleading information.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Berkshire also asserted that the ICC had failed to perform adequate historic preservation and environmental assessment analyses.  Finally, it argued that the ICC should have conditioned any exemption on the requirement that Housatonic allow Berkshire to operate the scenic railway.  After an extended review, the ICC denied Berkshire's petition.  Berkshire then sought review by this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this proceeding, Berkshire makes two principal arguments:  (1) Housatonic's allegedly false and misleading statements to the SHPO should render their exemption void ab initio;  and (2) the ICC's failure to conduct adequate historic preservation and environmental reviews requires it to conduct new reviews.  We find no merit in either contention.  After reciting the standard of review, we discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

The ICC has interpreted the regulation to require that such information concern a \"material\" part of the transaction.  Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">224486</span></span>, at * 3 (I.C.C.

Sept. 9, 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berkshire contends that Housatonic's representations to the SHPO contained three false or misleading statements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The substance of the alleged misrepresentations, derived from Housatonic's letter quoted above, are:  (1) no buildings are located on the property to be acquired;  (2) no change in use of the line is contemplated;  and (3) the property is now and will continue to be used for freight service.  Berkshire argues that these statements misrepresented the facts because:  (1) in light of its encroachment onto the railway right-of-way, the Lenox station is, in fact, located on the acquired property;  and (2) Housatonic did not disclose that they would subsequently refuse to allow Berkshire to operate the scenic railway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In lieu of the ICC's materiality requirement, Berkshire advocates a literal reading of the regulation:  any false or misleading information should lead to an exemption being void ab initio.   However, we accord substantial deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, see, e.g., Reich v. Simpson, Gumpertz &amp; Heger, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628627\"><a href=\"/opinion/628627/robert-b-reich-secretary-of-labor-v-simpson-gumpertz-heger-inc-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1993), and Berkshire has not persuaded us that, on these facts, that deference should be displaced.  Accordingly, we see no reason to depart from the ICC's materiality requirement.  Moreover, the ICC had ample basis to conclude that Housatonic's statements fall far short of the materiality requirement.  With specific regard to the station-encroachment issue, the ICC found that Housatonic's representations were \"immaterial misstatements.\"   Had Housatonic represented the facts as they actually were, the transaction would have still qualified for a class exemption because historic preservation is simply not a material element of an \"acquisition and operation\" transaction.  We also note that, as a practical matter, there is nothing about the acquisition itself that could have adversely affected the portion of the station on the right-of-way.  Housatonic only proposed to operate railroad freight service, presumably a familiar activity on the tracks for most of the station's nearly ninety-year existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berkshire's second contention--that Housatonic did not disclose that they would subsequently refuse to allow Berkshire to operate the scenic railway--rests on an even shakier footing.  Not only is an agreement with Berkshire immaterial to a class exemption, but there is nothing in the ICA requiring Housatonic to allow Berkshire to use the tracks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, because we find that Housatonic did not proffer \"false or misleading information\" within the meaning of that phrase as interpreted by the ICC, Housatonic's exemption is not void ab initio under 49 C.F.R. Sec. 1150.32(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>C.

On review, we think the record provides a rational basis for the ICC's disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires that a federal licensing agency shall, prior to the issuance of a license, \"take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register.\"  16 U.S.C. Sec. 470f.  Applicable regulations, appearing at 36 C.F.R. Sec. 800.9, set forth various \"adverse effect\" criteria to be considered by the federal entity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Berkshire argues that Housatonic's acquisition is inconsistent with two such criteria:  (1) \"[i]solation of the property from or alteration of the character of the property's setting when that character contributes to the property's qualification for the National Register\";  and (2) \"[n]eglect of a property resulting in its deterioration or destruction.\"  36 C.F.R. Sec. 800.9(b)(2) &amp; Sec. 800.9(b)(4).  Berkshire reasons that, because it may no longer operate the scenic railway, the Lenox station is both \"functionally isolated\" (Berkshire's phrase) from its setting as well as deprived of revenues for the station's renovation, thus leading to its \"deterioration.\"   Accordingly, Berkshire argues, the petition should be remanded for a full review under Section 106.  Berkshire also argues that any exemption should be conditioned on Housatonic's agreement to allow Berkshire to use the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in a charitable light, Berkshire's arguments strain credulity.  As to Berkshire's first contention, there is no basis for a claim of isolation, functional or otherwise.  At least three factors support this conclusion.  First, as noted above, largely because of an apparent breakdown in the B &amp; M-Berkshire relationship, the scenic railway had not operated for more than a year prior to the Housatonic acquisition.  At most, therefore, the effect of the Housatonic transaction on the then-non-functioning scenic railway was to perpetuate the status quo.  In other words, we find no basis to conclude that the Housatonic exemption led to the \"isolation\" Berkshire claims has resulted.  Second, as the ICC notes, the SHPO issued a no-effect letter, in which neither Lenox station nor the scenic railway were discussed.  Third, we think that Berkshire's claim of \"isolation ... from the property's setting\" is facially implausible in view of the fact that the historic property in question--a railway station--abuts and, indeed, actually encroaches upon an active railroad right-of-way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berkshire's \"deterioration\" argument is similarly unavailing.  Whatever \"deterioration\" might have flowed from the cessation of the scenic railway was not an effect caused by Housatonic's exemption.  As noted above, the scenic railway had ceased operating well before the Housatonic acquisition.  Moreover, as the ICC notes, a substantial question exists as to whether it has jurisdiction to grant the relief Berkshire seeks--that is, conditioning any exemption on Berkshire's right to use the track.  Because we find that the exemption gives rise to no adverse effects, we need not reach the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Berkshire argues that the ICC should have required an environmental assessment of the effects of the acquisition.  Again, we do not agree.  Under then-existing regulations, the ICC did not require environmental assessments when there was \"only a change in ownership or similar changes;  such an issuance of securities or reorganization, but not involving a change in carrier operations.\"  49 C.F.R. Sec. 1105.6(c)(2) (1990).  The ICC reasoned that because no operational changes were involved in the Housatonic transaction, an assessment was not required.  Berkshire, however, points to another then-existing regulation under which an assessment would normally have been required when the proposed transaction involved an \"abandonment, acquisition, or operation of a line of railroad.\"  49 C.F.R. Sec. 1105.6(b)(1) (1990).  Berkshire argues that, by its terms, the former Sec. 1105.6(c)(2) does not apply to an acquisition and operation of a line by a different entity and, in any event, the former Sec. 1105.6(b)(1) directly applies.  In its denial of Berkshire's petition, the ICC indicated that the former regulation applied.  Before this court, the ICC concedes that either regulation could apply to the transaction.  Inasmuch as the transaction did not involve a significant change in operations on the track, we conclude the ICC did have a rational basis for not requiring an environmental assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Constructed in 1902, the Lenox station was added to the National Register of Historic Places (\"National Register\") in 1989</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record suggests that by 1989, the B &amp; M-Berkshire relationship had deteriorated significantly.

Housatonic Track Company, Inc., was a noncarrier for purposes of the regulations.  Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec. 10901, the ICC may issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity.  Alternatively, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 10505 authorizes exemptions from Sec. 10901's formal certification process if the exemption is needed to advance \"rail transportation policy.\"   Under this authority, the ICC has exempted so-called \"acquisition and operation\" applications, such as Housatonic's, from the full-blown certification process.
