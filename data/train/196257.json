Appellant,  Robert  M.  Desmond, filed  a\r                            \r\n\nnotice  of appeal which bore the district court docket number\r\n\nof  McCullough v. Desmond et al., 90-cv-11788.  Any appeal in\r                                            \r\n\nthat  case is  untimely.

Desmond, 94-cv-12216.   In  particular, Desmond  seeks to\r                       \r\n\nappeal the judgment,  which entered on December 30, 1994, and\r\n\nthe denial  of  his motion  to  vacate that  judgment,  which\r\n\nentered  on February 1, 1995.

As his notice of appeal did not bear the docket number\r\n\nof  94-cv-12216, however, it was not entered in that case and\r\n\nit is now too late to file a timely notice  of appeal in that\r\n\ncase.\r\n\n     Assuming without  deciding  that the  notice  of  appeal\r\n\nerroneously filed in docket number 90-cv-11788 may be treated\r\n\nas having  been timely filed in docket number 94-cv-12216, we\r\n\nwould,  in any event, affirm.   Desmond was  on timely notice\r\n\nthat  McCullough  had filed  a  motion  for  judgment on  the\r\n\npleadings.  Yet, he  did not notify either McCullough  or the\r\n\ndistrict court that he allegedly had not received his copy of\r\n\nthat motion  and supporting memorandum until  his receipt one\r\n\nmonth  later  of  the  order  granting  McCullough's  motion.\r\n\nFurther, he  has never  proffered any  grounds to oppose  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nentry  of  judgment  on  the  pleadings  that  would  warrant\r\n\nvacating that judgment.\r\n\n     There was no  abuse of discretion in  denying the motion\r\n\nto vacate the judgment and the order of the district court is\r\n\naffirmed.\r                     \r\n\n     Appellee's  motion for  just  damages  and double  costs\r\n\npursuant to Fed.
