Appellant  Blue Cross  Blue  Shield  of\n                     \n\nMassachusetts, Inc.  (the \"Company\")  in 1991 had  promulgated an\n\nOrganizational  Change  Policy (the  \"Policy\") pursuant  to which\n\nemployees were to receive severance benefits when their positions\n\nwere  eliminated  under  defined  circumstances.   In  1992,  the\n\nCompany  entered  into   an  information  systems   and  services\n\noutsourcing  agreement  with   Electronic  Data  Services,   Inc.\n\n(\"EDS\").   Pursuant to that agreement appellees who had performed\n\ninformation services work as Company employees became employed by\n\nEDS.  They claimed severance benefits under the Policy above.\n\n          We  agree with the  district court's determination that\n\nthe Company's  Policy excluded  only internal transfers  from its\n                                             \n\nseverance  benefit  provisions.    Appellant  concedes  that  the\n\n\"transfers\" at issue were not  internal transfers.  The  Policy's\n\nunambiguous language provided for severance benefits to employees\n\nterminated from their  positions at  the Company,  even if  those\n\nsame   employees   obtained   immediate   employment   elsewhere.\n\nAccordingly,  appellees are  entitled to  the benefits  for which\n\nthey sued; there was no need  for the court to consider extrinsic\n\nevidence to ascertain the parties' intent.\n\n          Appellant's reliance on our recent decision in Allen v.\n                                                              \n\nAdage, Inc., 967 F.2d  695 (1st Cir. 1992), is misplaced.   Allen\n                                                                 \n\nheld that in  the absence of ambiguity, the  language of the plan\n\ndetermines employee  eligibility for benefits.   See id.  at 701;\n                                                        \n\nBellino  v. Schlumberger  Technologies, 944  F.2d 26,  29-30 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir.  1991).  It did not hold that outsourcing agreements such as\n\n                              - 2 -\n\nthe  one  at  bar  shall  never  entitle  employees  to severance\n\nbenefits.  See Allen,  967 F.2d at 700-01;  Bellino, 944 F.2d  at\n                                                   \n\n30.\n\n          The  Company's remaining arguments concern the district\n\ncourt's measure of damages.  The Policy itself defined the proper\n\nmeasure  of damages,  thus  such payments  are  not punitive  and\n\nneither  offset  nor  integration  is required.    Had  appellant\n\nintended severance payments to be offset by money or benefits its\n\nformer employees  earned elsewhere, it  need merely have  said as\n\nmuch in the Policy.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                              - 3 -\n",
