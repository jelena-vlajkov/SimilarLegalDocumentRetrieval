Barbour v.\r                                                                    \r\n\nDynamics Research Corp., 63 F.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                   \r\n\n          Prudential hired Lehman in late 1974 to work as a\r\n\nbrokerage manager for the Greater New York Brokerage Agency. \r\n\nIn 1978, Lehman was relocated and promoted to agency manager\r\n\nof the brokerage agency in Boston, Massachusetts.  In 1986,\r\n\nPrudential expanded the territory of the agency run by\r\n\nLehman, making him director of its New England Brokerage\r\n\nAgency which included all of New England except Fairfield\r\n\nCounty in Connecticut.  Even after the expansion, the New\r\n\nEngland agency was relatively small; nevertheless, it\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nperformed very well under Lehman's direction.  In 1988,\r\n\nPrudential created Pru Select, a separate sales division of\r\n\nPrudential's life insurance business, to supervise the twelve\r\n\nregional brokerage agencies.  Ira Kleinman was appointed\r\n\nPresident of Pru Select, and he hired Roger Dunker as Pru\r\n\nSelect's Senior Vice President.  Dunker, along with Lehman's\r\n\nprior supervisors, gave Lehman glowing performance reviews.\r\n\n          Effective January 1, 1990, Pru Select revised its\r\n\npension plan by changing the commencement year for\r\n\ncalculating average eligible earnings from 1979 to 1983,\r\n\nbenefitting more senior employees, and by providing a 50%\r\n\nannuity to widows without charge to the employee, benefitting\r\n\nLehman whose wife is fifteen years younger than he.  Lehman\r\n\nprojected the additional cost to Prudential of his pension,\r\n\nin light of the above modifications, to be $500,000.\r\n\n          Also at that time, Pru Select overhauled and\r\n\nstreamlined its brokerage agencies.  It consolidated its\r\n\ntwelve regions and directors into five regions and seven\r\n\ndirectors.  In December of 1990, Dunker told Lehman that as\r\n\nof April 1, 1991, his New England office was going to be\r\n\nconsolidated with the entire New York territory and part of\r\n\nthe New Jersey territory.  Lehman was to assume the duties\r\n\nand compensation scheme of a brokerage manager and report to\r\n\nthe co-managing directors in the newly created Northeast\r\n\nregion: Robert Kiley, the pre-consolidation director of the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nNew York office, and the newly hired David Dietz.  According\r\n\nto Lehman, his income potential as brokerage manager could be\r\n\nless than 25% of what it had been as a director.  Lehman was\r\n\ninstructed to formulate his own unit of brokers in New\r\n\nEngland from whom he could solicit business.  However, he did\r\n\nnot feel that this was possible, and after several meetings\r\n\nin which he attempted to define his new unit, he wrote to\r\n\nDunker stating that the reassignment of his responsibilities\r\n\nconstituted involuntary termination motivated by age\r\n\ndiscrimination.  Lehman then accepted an early retirement\r\n\npackage.\r\n\n          Before the merger, Lehman, aged 61, directed the\r\n\nNew England office, and Kiley, aged 57, directed the New York\r\n\noffice.  After consolidation of the two offices into the new\r\n\nNortheast region, the latter was headed jointly by Kiley and\r\n\nthe 42-year-old Dietz.  According to Lehman, the post-\r\n\nconsolidation directors had the same responsibilities as the\r\n\npre-consolidation directors, but instead of being\r\n\ngeographically separated, their responsibilities were now\r\n\nmore specialized.  The overall results of the various\r                               \r\n\nregional consolidations were that four of the twelve pre-\r\n\nconsolidation directors, aged 63, 57, 57, and 42, were\r\n\nappointed to director positions.  One of the pre-\r\n\nconsolidation directors, aged 62, retired.  The remaining\r\n\nseven pre-consolidation directors, aged 61 (Lehman), 47, 45,\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n45, 45, 41, and 37, were demoted to brokerage managers.  The\r\n\nthree newly appointed directors were aged 42, 42, and 40.  \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          This court reviews the district court's grant of\r\n\nsummary judgment de novo.

Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973)).  The first\r                                  \r\n\nstage consists of ascertaining whether the plaintiff has made\r\n\nout a prima facie case of discrimination.  If so, the burden\r\n\nshifts to the employer to provide a legitimate,\r\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.  In the\r\n\nthird stage, the plaintiff must establish either that the\r\n\nemployer's reason was a pretext or that the actual reason for\r\n\nthe adverse employment decision was discrimination.2  Blare\r                                                                       \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          It shall be an unlawful practice: . . .\r\n          1B.

Gen. L. ch. 151B,   4.\r\n\n2.  In this third stage, the burden on the plaintiff is less\r\nunder Massachusetts law than it is under federal law.  To\r\nsurvive summary judgment under federal law, the plaintiff is\r\nrequired to show that the employer's reason was pretextual\r\nand that the actual reason for the adverse employment\r\ndecision was discrimination.  Under Massachusetts law,\r\nshowing that an employer's proffered reason for an adverse\r\nemployment action is merely pretextual is sufficient by\r\nitself to survive summary judgment.

Lehman argues that this is a termination case rather\r\nthan a promotion case, and, therefore, he should only be\r\nrequired to show that he was performing his job in a\r\nsatisfactory manner and then was replaced by a younger person\r\nwith similar qualifications.  However, the facts of this case\r\nare more akin to a promotion case than to a termination case. \r\nLehman contends that Prudential should have hired him for the\r\nnewly created co-managing director position of the Northeast\r\nregion.  The elimination of Lehman's position as director of\r\nthe New England region in the consolidation did not entitle\r\nhim to the newly created co-managing director position.  As\r\nthe district court found, the two positions were not\r\nidentical.  The Northeast territory, including New York, New\r\nJersey, and most of New England, was much larger than\r\nLehman's New England territory.  Moreover, the duties of the\r\nco-managing directors were more specialized than the duties\r\nof the pre-consolidation directors had been. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981).

The district court found that Lehman failed to\r\n\npresent evidence showing that he was qualified for the\r\n\nco-managing director position and that the individual who was\r\n\nhired had qualifications similar to his.  The court held,\r\n\ntherefore, that Lehman had not presented a prima facie case\r\n\nagainst Prudential.  Since we find plaintiff did not meet his\r\n\nburden, in the context of summary judgment, of establishing\r\n\npretext, we need not tarry over the prima facie case issue. \r\n\nSee Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1993) (a court of appeals may affirm \"on any independently\r\n\nsufficient ground made manifest by the record\").\r\n\n          Even assuming a prima facie case was made, the\r\n\nburden shifted to Prudential to provide a legitimate business\r\n\nreason for its hiring decision.5  As the district court\r\n\nfound, Prudential's stated business reason for not hiring\r\n\nLehman as co-managing director was legitimate and non-\r\n\ndiscriminatory; it was also sufficiently supported in the\r\n\nrecord to satisfy the requirements of Massachusetts law.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWoods v.

See id. at 261.  Kleinman and Dunker\r                                          \r\n\nbelieved that Dietz would best add the qualities required for\r\n\nthe Northeast co-managing director position alongside of\r\n\nKiley.  In support of Prudential's asserted reason was a\r\n\nconsiderable body of evidence indicating that Dietz could\r\n\nreasonably be regarded as better suited to that position than\r\n\nLehman: (1) Dietz had greater experience in the supervision\r\n\nof national marketing efforts; (2) Dietz had greater\r\n\nexperience in managing large insurance organizations; (3)\r\n\nDietz had greater recognition as a leader in the life\r\n\ninsurance industry; and (4) Dietz got along better with the\r\n\nother co-managing director, Kiley.  Prudential, therefore,\r\n\nmet its second stage burden.\r\n\n          In the third stage, the burden returned to Lehman\r\n\nto produce evidence sufficient to support a jury verdict that\r\n\nit was more likely than not that (1) Prudential did not offer\r\n\nLehman the position he desired because of his age; or (2)\r                                                                 \r\n\nPrudential's reason for not offering Lehman that position was\r\n\na \"pretext.\"  See Blare, 646 N.E.2d at 118.  \"'[E]vidence\r                                   \r\n\nwhich may be relevant to the plaintiff's showing of pretext\r\n\nmay include application of a certain criterion to employees\r\n\n[not within the protected category]; the employer's general\r\n\npractice and policies concerning employment of [those within\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nthe protected category]; and the employer's treatment of the\r\n\nplaintiff during [his] employment.'\"  Id.

As already described, Dietz had\r\n\nimportant qualifications of his own that could reasonably\r\n\nlead to the belief that he was superior to Lehman for this\r\n\njob.  The position of co-managing director of the large,\r\n\nreorganized Northeast region involved different\r\n\nresponsibilities and could reasonably be thought to require a\r\n\ndifferent blend of talents than those required for solo\r\n\nmanagement of the smaller New England office.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  To demonstrate that the New England agency was successful\r\nunder his leadership, Lehman reports that (1) since 1986 the\r\nNew England agency was consistently in the top 40% of all\r\nagencies; (2) the agency had very good policy persistency and\r\nvery low expenses; (3) he had hired and trained six brokerage\r\nmanagers in New England; and (4) he had solicited work from\r\nbrokerage general agencies.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          It is undisputed that several of the pre-\r\n\nconsolidation directors were promoted and several were not,\r\n\nand their relative ages and performance records do not\r\n\nsuggest that those decisions were aged-based.  The average\r\n\nage of pre-consolidation directors appointed to be post-\r\n\nconsolidation directors was older than the average age of\r\n\nthose pre-consolidation directors, including Lehman, who were\r\n\nnot appointed.7  Lehman was treated the same as the other\r\n\nsix directors, all under 50, who were not promoted.  We\r\n\nrefuse to second guess Prudential's hiring decision for a\r\n\nmanagement position of this nature absent clearer evidence of\r\n\nirrationality.

The average age of the\r\nseven post-consolidation directors was 49 years, while the\r\naverage age of the seven pre-consolidation directors not\r\npromoted was 46 years.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          In addition to attempting to show Prudential's\r\n\nreason pretextual, Lehman provided what he considers indirect\r\n\nevidence of age discrimination.  Lehman pointed to a\r\n\nstatement made during the May 1990 Directors' Meeting, while\r\n\nKleinman was explaining changes in the expense formula used\r\n\nto calculate agency profitability.  Kleinman stated that the\r\n\nprevious expense component representing benefits was 31% of\r\n\nall compensation paid to employees and added that using 31%\r\n\n\"was a gift\" because of \"the age of some of the Directors.\" \r\n\nContrary to Lehman's allegations, this statement does not\r\n\nshow animus based on age, but rather merely states that the\r\n\nformula that had been employed was favorable to older\r\n\ndirectors and points out that the use of actual costs under\r\n\nthe modified method might result in higher assessments.  This\r\n\nstatement -- which did not mention Lehman, and in no way\r\n\nindicated that older directors were lacking in competence --\r\n\nprovides insufficient basis for an inference that Prudential\r\n\ndid not offer Lehman the position he wanted because of his\r\n\nage.8  Isolated, ambiguous remarks are insufficient, by\r\n\nthemselves, to prove discriminatory intent.  See Gagne v.\r                                                                  \r\n\nNorthwestern Nat'l Ins.

Dr.\r\n\nLienberger discussed the need to adapt products and marketing\r\n\nto demographic changes in the marketplace. One of several\r\n\nslides shown by Dr. Lienberger depicted the \"Organizational\r\n\nMan\" of the \"Ozzie and Harriet\" generation as being\r\n\npessimistic, being cautious, being oriented to bureaucracies,\r\n\nand having a 30-year career plan; in contrast, the \"New\r\n\nManager\" of the \"Kuzak &amp; Gracie of L.A. Law\" generation was\r\n\ndepicted as risk taking, optimistic, well educated and\r\n\nhardworking.  Dunker, who had attended Dr. Lienberger's\r\n\npresentation, decided to include a videotape of the\r\n\npresentation and photostats of the slides as part of a\r\n\ndiscussion in the November 1990 Directors' Meeting.  Due to\r\n\ntime constraints, the videotape was not shown; nonetheless,\r\n\nthe directors, including Lehman, received a copy of the\r\n\nphotostats.  Lehman argued that the comparisons made on the\r\n\n\"Organizational Man\" photostat indicated an age-stereotyped\r\n\nmentality.  However, we think it too long a stretch to\r\n\ninterpret a photostat generated by a marketing consultant in\r\n\nan entirely different context as indicating that Prudential\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nwas biased when placing its older brokerage employees.  There\r\n\nis no evidence in the record before us that the photostat and\r\n\nits context had any relation to the decision of whom to hire\r\n\nas co-managing brokerage directors.  We conclude that\r\n\nLehman's evidence, taken at its best, was insufficient to\r\n\nshow that, in not appointing Lehman to the co-managing\r\n\ndirector position, Prudential was motivated by age\r\n\ndiscrimination or that its asserted reason for not appointing\r\n\nhim was pretextual.\r\n\n             Pension Discrimination Claim (ERISA)\r                         Pension Discrimination Claim (ERISA)\r\n\n          Lehman's second claim against Prudential was for\r\n\nunlawful pension discrimination in violation of section 510\r\n\nof ERISA.  29 U.S.C.   1140.9  Lehman alleged that\r\n\nPrudential hired a younger person for the co-managing\r\n\ndirector position to avoid the high cost of funding his\r\n\npension.

In the first stage, Lehman must set\r\n\nforth a prima facie case by demonstrating that: (1) he had\r\n\nthe opportunity to attain rights under an ERISA benefit plan;\r\n\n(2) he was qualified for the position at issue; and (3) he\r\n\nwas subjected to adverse action under circumstances that give\r\n\nrise to an inference of discrimination.

ERISA provides no relief if the\r                  \r\n\nloss of an employee's benefits was incidental to, and not the\r\n\nreason for, the adverse employment action.  Were this not so,\r\n\nevery discharged employee who had been a member of a benefit\r\n\nplan would have a potential cause of action against his or\r\n\nher former employer under ERISA.

To demonstrate that\r                           \r\n\nPrudential acted with the specific intention of interfering\r\n\nwith Lehman's ERISA benefits, Lehman must show \"(1) that\r\n\n[Prudential's] articulated reason for its employment actions\r\n\nwas a pretext; and (2) that the true reason was to interfere\r                              \r\n\nwith [Lehman's] receipt of benefits.\"  Barbour, 63 F.3d at 39\r                                                          \r\n\n(emphasis added).  On this record, we find no genuine issue\r\n\nof fact either that Prudential was motivated by a\r\n\ndiscriminatory purpose or that Prudential's reason for not\r\n\nhiring Lehman co-managing director was not credible. \r\n\n          Effective January 1, 1990, Prudential made\r\n\nadjustments to its company-wide pension plan which Lehman\r\n\nestimates increased Prudential's cost of funding his pension\r\n\nby about $500,000 over time.  Lehman contends that Prudential\r\n\nwas aware of the high cost of his benefits10 and refused to\r\n\noffer him the co-managing director position in an effort to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  Lehman points out that Prudential discovered an \"expense\r\ngap\" when it was first required to calculate age-related\r\ncosts for certain pension plans.  \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nreduce this cost (pension benefit obligations being lesser\r\n\nfor younger people).  Lehman again points to Kleinman's\r\n\nstatement that benefits actually cost more than they had been\r\n\nestimating because of \"the age of some of the Directors.\"   \r\n\n          Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n\nLehman, we find nothing that would cause a reasonable fact-\r\n\nfinder to doubt Prudential's explanation for its hiring\r\n\ndecision.  Prudential's mere awareness of the high cost of\r\n\npension obligations combined with the single isolated\r\n\nambiguous remark by Kleinman were insufficient, by\r\n\nthemselves, to establish Prudential's discriminatory intent. \r\n\nLehman did not contradict deposition testimony that\r\n\nPrudential's benefit costs were calculated on a company-wide\r\n\nbasis, and that Pru Select's top management, who made the\r\n\nhiring decision, received no individual employee calculation\r\n\nof pension costs.  Nor did Lehman contradict deposition\r\n\ntestimony that Prudential did not have knowledge of his\r\n\nwife's age, knowledge that would be necessary to compute his\r\n\npension obligation.  No material connection appears between\r\n\nthe cost of funding Lehman's pension and Prudential's\r\n\ndecision to hire Dietz rather than Lehman.  We are satisfied\r\n\nthat the record would not support a finding that Prudential\r\n\ndid not hire Lehman as co-managing director because of the\r\n\ncost of funding his pension.  \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nAffirmed.

In 1986,\r\n\nPrudential expanded the territory of the agency run by\r\n\nLehman, making him director of its New England Brokerage\r\n\nAgency which included all of New England except Fairfield\r\n\nCounty in Connecticut.  Even after the expansion, the New\r\n\nEngland agency was relatively small; nevertheless, it\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nperformed very well under Lehman's direction.  In 1988,\r\n\nPrudential created Pru Select, a separate sales division of\r\n\nPrudential's life insurance business, to supervise the twelve\r\n\nregional brokerage agencies.  Ira Kleinman was appointed\r\n\nPresident of Pru Select, and he hired Roger Dunker as Pru\r\n\nSelect's Senior Vice President.  Dunker, along with Lehman's\r\n\nprior supervisors, gave Lehman glowing performance reviews.\r\n\n          Effective January 1, 1990, Pru Select revised its\r\n\npension plan by changing the commencement year for\r\n\ncalculating average eligible earnings from 1979 to 1983,\r\n\nbenefitting more senior employees, and by providing a 50%\r\n\nannuity to widows without charge to the employee, benefitting\r\n\nLehman whose wife is fifteen years younger than he.  Lehman\r\n\nprojected the additional cost to Prudential of his pension,\r\n\nin light of the above modifications, to be $500,000.\r\n\n          Also at that time, Pru Select overhauled and\r\n\nstreamlined its brokerage agencies.  It consolidated its\r\n\ntwelve regions and directors into five regions and seven\r\n\ndirectors.  In December of 1990, Dunker told Lehman that as\r\n\nof April 1, 1991, his New England office was going to be\r\n\nconsolidated with the entire New York territory and part of\r\n\nthe New Jersey territory.  Lehman was to assume the duties\r\n\nand compensation scheme of a brokerage manager and report to\r\n\nthe co-managing directors in the newly created Northeast\r\n\nregion: Robert Kiley, the pre-consolidation director of the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nNew York office, and the newly hired David Dietz.  According\r\n\nto Lehman, his income potential as brokerage manager could be\r\n\nless than 25% of what it had been as a director.  Lehman was\r\n\ninstructed to formulate his own unit of brokers in New\r\n\nEngland from whom he could solicit business.  However, he did\r\n\nnot feel that this was possible, and after several meetings\r\n\nin which he attempted to define his new unit, he wrote to\r\n\nDunker stating that the reassignment of his responsibilities\r\n\nconstituted involuntary termination motivated by age\r\n\ndiscrimination.  Lehman then accepted an early retirement\r\n\npackage.\r\n\n          Before the merger, Lehman, aged 61, directed the\r\n\nNew England office, and Kiley, aged 57, directed the New York\r\n\noffice.  After consolidation of the two offices into the new\r\n\nNortheast region, the latter was headed jointly by Kiley and\r\n\nthe 42-year-old Dietz.  According to Lehman, the post-\r\n\nconsolidation directors had the same responsibilities as the\r\n\npre-consolidation directors, but instead of being\r\n\ngeographically separated, their responsibilities were now\r\n\nmore specialized.  The overall results of the various\r                               \r\n\nregional consolidations were that four of the twelve pre-\r\n\nconsolidation directors, aged 63, 57, 57, and 42, were\r\n\nappointed to director positions.  One of the pre-\r\n\nconsolidation directors, aged 62, retired.  The remaining\r\n\nseven pre-consolidation directors, aged 61 (Lehman), 47, 45,\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n45, 45, 41, and 37, were demoted to brokerage managers.  The\r\n\nthree newly appointed directors were aged 42, 42, and 40.  \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          This court reviews the district court's grant of\r\n\nsummary judgment de novo.

The first\r                                  \r\n\nstage consists of ascertaining whether the plaintiff has made\r\n\nout a prima facie case of discrimination.  If so, the burden\r\n\nshifts to the employer to provide a legitimate,\r\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.  In the\r\n\nthird stage, the plaintiff must establish either that the\r\n\nemployer's reason was a pretext or that the actual reason for\r\n\nthe adverse employment decision was discrimination.2  Blare\r                                                                       \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          It shall be an unlawful practice: . . .\r\n          1B.

To\r\nsurvive summary judgment under federal law, the plaintiff is\r\nrequired to show that the employer's reason was pretextual\r\nand that the actual reason for the adverse employment\r\ndecision was discrimination.  Under Massachusetts law,\r\nshowing that an employer's proffered reason for an adverse\r\nemployment action is merely pretextual is sufficient by\r\nitself to survive summary judgment.

Lehman argues that this is a termination case rather\r\nthan a promotion case, and, therefore, he should only be\r\nrequired to show that he was performing his job in a\r\nsatisfactory manner and then was replaced by a younger person\r\nwith similar qualifications.  However, the facts of this case\r\nare more akin to a promotion case than to a termination case. \r\nLehman contends that Prudential should have hired him for the\r\nnewly created co-managing director position of the Northeast\r\nregion.  The elimination of Lehman's position as director of\r\nthe New England region in the consolidation did not entitle\r\nhim to the newly created co-managing director position.  As\r\nthe district court found, the two positions were not\r\nidentical.  The Northeast territory, including New York, New\r\nJersey, and most of New England, was much larger than\r\nLehman's New England territory.  Moreover, the duties of the\r\nco-managing directors were more specialized than the duties\r\nof the pre-consolidation directors had been. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253 (1981).

As already described, Dietz had\r\n\nimportant qualifications of his own that could reasonably\r\n\nlead to the belief that he was superior to Lehman for this\r\n\njob.  The position of co-managing director of the large,\r\n\nreorganized Northeast region involved different\r\n\nresponsibilities and could reasonably be thought to require a\r\n\ndifferent blend of talents than those required for solo\r\n\nmanagement of the smaller New England office.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  To demonstrate that the New England agency was successful\r\nunder his leadership, Lehman reports that (1) since 1986 the\r\nNew England agency was consistently in the top 40% of all\r\nagencies; (2) the agency had very good policy persistency and\r\nvery low expenses; (3) he had hired and trained six brokerage\r\nmanagers in New England; and (4) he had solicited work from\r\nbrokerage general agencies.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          It is undisputed that several of the pre-\r\n\nconsolidation directors were promoted and several were not,\r\n\nand their relative ages and performance records do not\r\n\nsuggest that those decisions were aged-based.  The average\r\n\nage of pre-consolidation directors appointed to be post-\r\n\nconsolidation directors was older than the average age of\r\n\nthose pre-consolidation directors, including Lehman, who were\r\n\nnot appointed.7  Lehman was treated the same as the other\r\n\nsix directors, all under 50, who were not promoted.  We\r\n\nrefuse to second guess Prudential's hiring decision for a\r\n\nmanagement position of this nature absent clearer evidence of\r\n\nirrationality.

Lehman pointed to a\r\n\nstatement made during the May 1990 Directors' Meeting, while\r\n\nKleinman was explaining changes in the expense formula used\r\n\nto calculate agency profitability.  Kleinman stated that the\r\n\nprevious expense component representing benefits was 31% of\r\n\nall compensation paid to employees and added that using 31%\r\n\n\"was a gift\" because of \"the age of some of the Directors.\" \r\n\nContrary to Lehman's allegations, this statement does not\r\n\nshow animus based on age, but rather merely states that the\r\n\nformula that had been employed was favorable to older\r\n\ndirectors and points out that the use of actual costs under\r\n\nthe modified method might result in higher assessments.  This\r\n\nstatement -- which did not mention Lehman, and in no way\r\n\nindicated that older directors were lacking in competence --\r\n\nprovides insufficient basis for an inference that Prudential\r\n\ndid not offer Lehman the position he wanted because of his\r\n\nage.8  Isolated, ambiguous remarks are insufficient, by\r\n\nthemselves, to prove discriminatory intent.

Dr.\r\n\nLienberger discussed the need to adapt products and marketing\r\n\nto demographic changes in the marketplace. One of several\r\n\nslides shown by Dr. Lienberger depicted the \"Organizational\r\n\nMan\" of the \"Ozzie and Harriet\" generation as being\r\n\npessimistic, being cautious, being oriented to bureaucracies,\r\n\nand having a 30-year career plan; in contrast, the \"New\r\n\nManager\" of the \"Kuzak &amp; Gracie of L.A. Law\" generation was\r\n\ndepicted as risk taking, optimistic, well educated and\r\n\nhardworking.  Dunker, who had attended Dr. Lienberger's\r\n\npresentation, decided to include a videotape of the\r\n\npresentation and photostats of the slides as part of a\r\n\ndiscussion in the November 1990 Directors' Meeting.  Due to\r\n\ntime constraints, the videotape was not shown; nonetheless,\r\n\nthe directors, including Lehman, received a copy of the\r\n\nphotostats.  Lehman argued that the comparisons made on the\r\n\n\"Organizational Man\" photostat indicated an age-stereotyped\r\n\nmentality.  However, we think it too long a stretch to\r\n\ninterpret a photostat generated by a marketing consultant in\r\n\nan entirely different context as indicating that Prudential\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nwas biased when placing its older brokerage employees.  There\r\n\nis no evidence in the record before us that the photostat and\r\n\nits context had any relation to the decision of whom to hire\r\n\nas co-managing brokerage directors.  We conclude that\r\n\nLehman's evidence, taken at its best, was insufficient to\r\n\nshow that, in not appointing Lehman to the co-managing\r\n\ndirector position, Prudential was motivated by age\r\n\ndiscrimination or that its asserted reason for not appointing\r\n\nhim was pretextual.\r\n\n             Pension Discrimination Claim (ERISA)\r                         Pension Discrimination Claim (ERISA)\r\n\n          Lehman's second claim against Prudential was for\r\n\nunlawful pension discrimination in violation of section 510\r\n\nof ERISA.  29 U.S.C.   1140.9  Lehman alleged that\r\n\nPrudential hired a younger person for the co-managing\r\n\ndirector position to avoid the high cost of funding his\r\n\npension.

To demonstrate that\r                           \r\n\nPrudential acted with the specific intention of interfering\r\n\nwith Lehman's ERISA benefits, Lehman must show \"(1) that\r\n\n[Prudential's] articulated reason for its employment actions\r\n\nwas a pretext; and (2) that the true reason was to interfere\r                              \r\n\nwith [Lehman's] receipt of benefits.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196245\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Barbour,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196245/barbour-v-dynamics-research/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">39</span>\r</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">                                                          \r\n\n(emphasis added).  On this record, we find no genuine issue\r\n\nof fact either that Prudential was motivated by a\r\n\ndiscriminatory purpose or that Prudential's reason for not\r\n\nhiring Lehman co-managing director was not credible. \r\n\n          Effective January 1, 1990, Prudential made\r\n\nadjustments to its company-wide pension plan which Lehman\r\n\nestimates increased Prudential's cost of funding his pension\r\n\nby about $500,000 over time.  Lehman contends that Prudential\r\n\nwas aware of the high cost of his benefits10 and refused to\r\n\noffer him the co-managing director position in an effort to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  Lehman points out that Prudential discovered an \"expense\r\ngap\" when it was first required to calculate age-related\r\ncosts for certain pension plans.  \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nreduce this cost (pension benefit obligations being lesser\r\n\nfor younger people).  Lehman again points to Kleinman's\r\n\nstatement that benefits actually cost more than they had been\r\n\nestimating because of \"the age of some of the Directors.\"   \r\n\n          Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n\nLehman, we find nothing that would cause a reasonable fact-\r\n\nfinder to doubt Prudential's explanation for its hiring\r\n\ndecision.  Prudential's mere awareness of the high cost of\r\n\npension obligations combined with the single isolated\r\n\nambiguous remark by Kleinman were insufficient, by\r\n\nthemselves, to establish Prudential's discriminatory intent. \r\n\nLehman did not contradict deposition testimony that\r\n\nPrudential's benefit costs were calculated on a company-wide\r\n\nbasis, and that Pru Select's top management, who made the\r\n\nhiring decision, received no individual employee calculation\r\n\nof pension costs.  Nor did Lehman contradict deposition\r\n\ntestimony that Prudential did not have knowledge of his\r\n\nwife's age, knowledge that would be necessary to compute his\r\n\npension obligation.  No material connection appears between\r\n\nthe cost of funding Lehman's pension and Prudential's\r\n\ndecision to hire Dietz rather than Lehman.  We are satisfied\r\n\nthat the record would not support a finding that Prudential\r\n\ndid not hire Lehman as co-managing director because of the\r\n\ncost of funding his pension.  \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nAffirmed.
