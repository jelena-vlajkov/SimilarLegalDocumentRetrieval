Gerald  Hoyt Humphrey  appeals  his\r                                 \r\n\nsentencing  as an  armed career  criminal  under 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n924(e), claiming  that he  did not  have the  requisite three\r\n\nconvictions for crimes committed on \"occasions different from\r\n\none  another.\"   The  district  court  found that  Humphrey's\r\n\ncrimes  of armed  robbery,  on the  one  hand, and  attempted\r\n\nmurder and kidnapping,  on the other,  had been committed  on\r\n\ndifferent occasions, so that his convictions for those crimes\r\n\nqualified   as  two  of   the  required   three  convictions.\r\n\n(Humphrey also  had a previous  conviction for manslaughter.)\r\n\nAs  the district court  found, those crimes  are different in\r\n\nnature and were committed on  different days and at different\r\n\nlocations.  We add  as well that they were  committed against\r\n\ndifferent victims.  Under the circumstances, it is clear that\r\n\nthe district court did  not err in sentencing Humphrey  as an\r\n\narmed  career  criminal.
