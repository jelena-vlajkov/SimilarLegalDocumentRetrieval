Relying on  our recent opinion  in Puerto Rico\n                                                                 \n\nSun Oil Co.  v. United  States EPA,  8 F.3d 73  (1st Cir.  1993),\n                                  \n\nCaribbean contends that EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously by\n\nincorporating a water  quality certification issued by  the Envi-\n\nronmental Quality Board of the Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico (EQB)\n\nwhich was still undergoing review by the EQB.  Finding no  error,\n\nwe deny the petition for review.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          We had occasion, in Puerto  Rico Sun Oil, to survey the\n                                                  \n\nregulatory framework controlling the present appeal:  \n\n               The  Clean Water Act,  33 U.S.C.   1251,\n          et seq.,  prohibits the  discharge into  pro-\n                 \n          tected waters of any pollutant by any person,\n          id.   1311(a), unless  a discharge permit has\n             \n          been  secured from  EPA.   Id.    1342.   The\n                                        \n          permitting regime is  a hybrid  one in  which\n          both  EPA and  the  counterpart state  agency\n          play a  role.   The precise  role depends  on\n          whether  EPA  has  delegated  permit  issuing\n          authority  to the state;  but no such delega-\n          tion is present here.  Puerto Rico is treated\n          as  a state for  purposes of the  Clean Water\n          Act, id.    1362(3), and its local  agency is\n                  \n          the Environmental Quality Board.\n\n                                2\n\n               To obtain  a permit, the  applicant must\n          satisfy a variety of substantive requirements\n          under the Clean  Water Act but,  in addition,\n          no EPA permit  can issue unless the  state in\n          which the  discharge will occur gives its own\n          approval (called  \"certification\") or  waives\n          its right to do so.   33 U.S.C.   1341(a)(1).\n          Further, the  state certification  may impose\n          discharge  limitations  or  requirements more\n          stringent  than  federal  law  requires,  and\n          those more stringent obligations are incorpo-\n          rated  into the federal permit as a matter of\n          course.  See generally United States v. Mara-\n                                                       \n          thon Development Corp., 867  F.2d 96, 99 (1st\n                                \n          Cir. 1989) (describing state role).\n\nId. at 74-75.\n   \n\n          Petitioner  Caribbean  discharges  a  large  volume  of\n\nprocess and storm  water from its Bayamon,  Puerto Rico, refining\n\nfacility into Las Lajas Creek, a protected waterway designated by\n\nEQB as  a drinking  water source.   Caribbean has  been regulated\n\nunder the Clean  Water Act National Pollution  Discharge Elimina-\n\ntion System (NPDES) at its  Bayamon operation since it was issued\n\na  five-year permit in  1983.   The present  controversy surfaced\n\nduring the NPDES renewal process, which proceeded as follows:\n\n     10/27/88  Caribbean files NPDES renewal\n     10/27/88\n               application with EPA.\n\n     11/10/88  EPA requests EQB certification. \n     11/10/88\n\n     02/01/89  EQB issues draft certification,\n     02/01/89\n               instructing EPA that it \"shall be\n               incorporated into [Caribbean's]\n               NPDES permit.\"\n\n     04/07/89  Caribbean submits comments to EQB\n     04/07/89\n               on draft certification, contending\n               that its pollutant concentration\n               standards are unreasonable,\n               impractical, and unfeasible.\n\n                                3\n\n     05/10/89  EQB issues (substantially\n     05/10/89            \n               unmodified) final certification.\n                                              \n\n     06/30/89  Caribbean requests EQB \n     06/30/89\n               reconsideration of certification\n               issued 5/10/89.\n\n     08/07/89  EPA issues draft NPDES to Caribbean\n     08/07/89\n               incorporating the 5/10/89 final\n               certification.\n\n     09/06/89  EPA receives comments on draft\n     09/06/89\n               NPDES from Caribbean. \n\n     10/13/89  EQB notifies EPA that it is\n     10/13/89                             \n               reviewing the 5/10/89 certification\n                                                  \n               and requests that EPA delay is-\n               suance of final NPDES pending re-\n               view. \n\n     09/28/90  EPA issues final NPDES, incorpora-\n     09/28/90\n               ting 5/10/89 certification.\n\n          At the time the final NPDES was issued on September 28,\n\n1990, EPA considered  the May 10, 1989  certification appropriate\n\nfor  incorporation into  the final  NPDES  because EQB  had never\n\nstayed its certification and it therefore remained in effect as a\n\nmatter of  law.  Now, more than five  years later, EQB has yet to\n\nact on  Caribbean's request  for reconsideration  of the  \"final\"\n\ncertification issued May 10, 1989. \n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Caribbean attempts to  rest its challenge to  the final\n\nNPDES on the coattails of Puerto Rico Sun Oil, by posing the same\n                                             \n\ngeneric question involved there:  Is it  arbitrary and capricious\n\n                                4\n\nfor EPA to incorporate a water quality certification into a final\n\nNPDES  while the certification ostensibly is undergoing review by\n\nthe local agency?  In Puerto Rico Sun Oil, we held that there was\n                                         \n\nno procedural  bar to the  incorporation of an  EQB certification\n             \n\nwhich had  not been  stayed until after  the final  NPDES issued.\n\nId. at 77.  In a similar  vein, we perceive no serious procedural\n   \n\nobstacle in the  present case.1   We went on  to hold,  neverthe-\n\nless, that in the circumstances presented in Puerto Rico Sun Oil,\n                                                                \n\nEPA's decision \"made  no sense,\"  and amounted  to arbitrary  and\n\ncapricious agency action  absent explanation.  Id.   By contrast,\n                                                  \n\nhowever,  here the  only colorable  rationality  claim raised  by\n\nCaribbean rests on a far less substantial basis.  \n\n          \"The  scope  of   review  under   the  'arbitrary   and\n\ncapricious' standard is  narrow and a court is  not to substitute\n\nits judgment for  that of the agency.\" Motor  Vehicle Mfrs.

Agency\n                                \n\nactions are not to be set  aside as arbitrary and capricious, see\n                                                                 \n\nAdministrative Procedure Act,  5 U.S.C.   706(2)(a),  unless they\n\n                    \n\n     1Caribbean  raises two  lackluster  procedural claims  which\nwarrant but brief consideration.  First, a request from the local\ncertifying agency that  EPA delay issuance  of its NPDES  pending\nreconsideration  of the  local agency  certification  is not  the\nequivalent of  a formal stay  suspending the legal effect  of the\ncertification,  such as  EPA issued  in the  Puerto Rico  Sun Oil\n                                                                 \nproceedings,  see Puerto Rico  Sun Oil,  8 F.3d  at 80.   Second,\n                                      \nsince  the original certification  was never stayed,  EPA was not\nobliged to resort  to the procedures in 40  C.F.R.   122.44(d)(3)\nto compel EQB  either to issue a new certification within 60 days\nor waive certification. See Puerto Rico Sun Oil, 8 F.3d at 80.\n                                               \n\n                                5\n\nlack  a rational  basis.   See, e.g.,  Rhode Island  Higher Educ.\n                                                                 \n\nAssistance Auth. v.  Department of Educ., 929 F.2d  844, 855 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1991).   Like other executive  agencies acting within  their\n\nrespective  bailiwicks,  EPA  is  due  substantial  deference  in\n\ninterpreting and implementing the Clean  Water Act -- \"so long as\n\n[its] decisions do not collide directly with substantive statuto-\n\nry  commands  and  so  long as  procedural  corners  are squarely\n\nturned.\" Puerto Rico Sun Oil, 8 F.3d at 77; see generally Chevron\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.A. v. Natural  Resources Defense Council,  467 U.S. 837,  843\n                                            \n\n(1984).   We  therefore inquire  whether,  in the  vernacular  of\n\nPuerto Rico Sun Oil, the challenged EPA action    its issuance of\n                   \n\na  final NPDES notwithstanding  EQB's request that  EPA forestall\n\nits  processes in anticipation  of further action  on Caribbean's\n\nrequest for review of the EQB certification    makes sense. \n\n          First,  surface  appearances   aside,  several  factors\n\nplainly reflect  that this case is  not of a  feather with Puerto\n                                                                 \n\nRico Sun Oil.  Not least  important is the fact that EPA  delayed\n            \n\nits issuance of  the Caribbean NPDES  for almost a year  at EQB's\n                                                       \n\nrequest; whereas in Puerto Rico  Sun Oil EPA incorporated the EQB\n                                        \n\ncertification   within   two  weeks   after  learning   that  the\n                                   \n\ncertification was  being reconsidered by EQB.   Thus, whereas the\n\ntiming of  the EPA  action in  Puerto Rico  Sun Oil  lent to  the\n                                                   \n\nimpression that an  administrative trap had been  hastily snapped\n\nshut, there is nothing in the present record to indicate that the\n\n                                6\n\neleven and one-half  month period EPA afforded EQB  to review its\n\ncertification was either unreasonable or arbitrary. \n\n          Second,  the  significance  of the  timing  of  the EPA\n\naction  in Puerto  Rico Sun  Oil was  magnified by  a substantive\n                                \n\nClean Water Act monitoring issue not implicated in these proceed-\n\nings.  As a consequence  of EPA's precipitous action, the permit-\n\ntee  in Puerto Rico  Sun Oil was  left to cope  with a monitoring\n                            \n\nmethodology unequivocally  disavowed by EQB.2  We found that this\n\nwhipsaw  certification procedure \"made no sense.\" Puerto Rico Sun\n                                                                 \n\nOil, 8 F.3d at 77.3  \n   \n\n                    \n\n     2The late 1980s witnessed an abortive effort by EQB to alter\nits  water quality  monitoring methodology.   For many  years EQB\nWater Quality  Standards had used  a \"mixing zone\"  method, which\ncalls for pollutant concentrations to be measured in the protect-\ned waters  into which the  permitted discharge occurs.   In 1989,\nhowever, EQB  issued a draft  document that  adopted an  \"end-of-\npipe\"  (or effluent)  approach, whereby  pollutant concentrations\nare measured  at the discharge  source, prior to dilution  in the\nreceiving waters.  Although this  draft document was withdrawn in\n1990, the  permittee in  Puerto Rico Sun  Oil had  been certified\n                                             \nduring the  brief reign of the new  \"effluent monitoring\" policy,\nand this  (presumably more  exacting) monitoring methodology  had\nbeen written into the certification EQB provided EPA.\n\n     3\"EQB  had used a mixing  zone analysis in  the past and was\nproposing  to do so in the future . .  . .  Yet just as [Sun Oil]\nmoved  to  correct the  EQB  certification, EPA  moved  even more\nswiftly to adopt a final permit based on the EQB certificate that\nomitted  a mixing zone analysis.\" Puerto  Rico Sun Oil, 8 F.3d at\n                                                      \n76.  \n     In sharp contrast, no such ambivalent EQB monitoring method-\nology  was at work in this case.   Effluent monitoring, see supra\n                                                                 \nnote 2, was  the pre-1990 baseline  for Caribbean, which,  unlike\nthe permittee in Puerto Rico Sun Oil, discharges into a designat-\n                                    \ned drinking water  source.  This much  is clear from the  face of\nthe 1983 permit: \"Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring\nrequirements set out  above shall be taken  at the outfall .  . .\nprior   to  discharge  to   Las  Lajas  Creek.\"     Additionally,\n\n                                7\n\n          Third, at no time did EQB stay its Caribbean certifica-\n\ntion.  In Puerto Rico Sun Oil, however, EQB issued a formal stay,\n                             \n\nalbeit after EPA had issued its NPDES incorporating the  certifi-\n\ncation.   Although this court held that the  ex post EQB stay was\n                                                    \n\nineffective, as a matter of  procedure under the Clean Water Act,\n\nid.  at 80  (\"We agree  with EPA  that the  [post-NPDES issuance]\n   \n\ndecision of  EQB to  re-characterize its  certification order  as\n\nnon-final cannot affect the procedural validity of EPA's decision\n\nto grant the permit.\"), the fact remains that EQB, by staying the\n\ncertification in  Puerto Rico Sun  Oil, took far more  timely and\n                                      \n\ndefinitive action than was ever  taken during the eleven and one-\n\nhalf  months (not  to mention  the ensuing  four years)  that EPA\n\nawaited EQB's promised review of the Caribbean certification.  \n\n          Finally, moving beyond the precedential shadow  cast by\n\nPuerto Rico  Sun Oil, Caribbean  has not identified (nor  can we)\n                    \n\nany other  potential manifestation  of  arbitrary and  capricious\n\nagency conduct on EPA's part.

In sum, there is no evidence that the EQB certifi-\ncation  issued  to Caribbean  was the  product of  a bureaucratic\nsnafu such as infected the  permitting process in Puerto Rico Sun\n                                                                 \nOil, 8  F.3d at  76 (noting that  EQB's certification  \"must have\n   \nappeared  a  probable  candidate for  administrative  or judicial\nrevision\"  as it incorporated effluent standards that had already\nbeen abandoned).\n\n                                8\n\naccommodation  of Caribbean's legitimate interests.

We decline to visit on EPA\n\n                    \n\n     4We need  not address  the complex issue  as to  whether any\nsuch changes  to Caribbean's NPDES  would run afoul of  the Clean\nWater Act \"anti-backsliding\" provisions.

See 33 U.S.C.   1342(o)(2) (prescribing five exceptions\n             \nto section 1342(o)).\n\n                                9\n\nthe  responsibility for  unexplained,  if not  inexplicable,  EQB\n\ndelays in undertaking or completing its promised reconsideration,\n\nnor to compromise in the meantime the important public  interests\n\nserved by the Clean Water Act. \n\n          The petition for review is denied.  \n                                     denied\n                                           \n\n                                10\n",

We  therefore inquire  whether,  in the  vernacular  of\n\nPuerto Rico Sun Oil, the challenged EPA action    its issuance of\n                   \n\na  final NPDES notwithstanding  EQB's request that  EPA forestall\n\nits  processes in anticipation  of further action  on Caribbean's\n\nrequest for review of the EQB certification    makes sense. \n\n          First,  surface  appearances   aside,  several  factors\n\nplainly reflect  that this case is  not of a  feather with Puerto\n                                                                 \n\nRico Sun Oil.  Not least  important is the fact that EPA  delayed\n            \n\nits issuance of  the Caribbean NPDES  for almost a year  at EQB's\n                                                       \n\nrequest; whereas in Puerto Rico  Sun Oil EPA incorporated the EQB\n                                        \n\ncertification   within   two  weeks   after  learning   that  the\n                                   \n\ncertification was  being reconsidered by EQB.   Thus, whereas the\n\ntiming of  the EPA  action in  Puerto Rico  Sun Oil  lent to  the\n                                                   \n\nimpression that an  administrative trap had been  hastily snapped\n\nshut, there is nothing in the present record to indicate that the\n\n                                6\n\neleven and one-half  month period EPA afforded EQB  to review its\n\ncertification was either unreasonable or arbitrary. \n\n          Second,  the  significance  of the  timing  of  the EPA\n\naction  in Puerto  Rico Sun  Oil was  magnified by  a substantive\n                                \n\nClean Water Act monitoring issue not implicated in these proceed-\n\nings.

For many  years EQB\nWater Quality  Standards had used  a \"mixing zone\"  method, which\ncalls for pollutant concentrations to be measured in the protect-\ned waters  into which the  permitted discharge occurs.   In 1989,\nhowever, EQB  issued a draft  document that  adopted an  \"end-of-\npipe\"  (or effluent)  approach, whereby  pollutant concentrations\nare measured  at the discharge  source, prior to dilution  in the\nreceiving waters.  Although this  draft document was withdrawn in\n1990, the  permittee in  Puerto Rico Sun  Oil had  been certified\n                                             \nduring the  brief reign of the new  \"effluent monitoring\" policy,\nand this  (presumably more  exacting) monitoring methodology  had\nbeen written into the certification EQB provided EPA.\n\n     3\"EQB  had used a mixing  zone analysis in  the past and was\nproposing  to do so in the future . .  . .

This much  is clear from the  face of\nthe 1983 permit: \"Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring\nrequirements set out  above shall be taken  at the outfall .  . .\nprior   to  discharge  to   Las  Lajas  Creek.\"     Additionally,\n\n                                7\n\n          Third, at no time did EQB stay its Caribbean certifica-\n\ntion.  In Puerto Rico Sun Oil, however, EQB issued a formal stay,\n                             \n\nalbeit after EPA had issued its NPDES incorporating the  certifi-\n\ncation.   Although this court held that the  ex post EQB stay was\n                                                    \n\nineffective, as a matter of  procedure under the Clean Water Act,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>  at 80 </span><pre class=\"inline\"> (\"We agree  with EPA  that the  [post-NPDES issuance]\n   \n\ndecision of  EQB to  re-characterize its  certification order  as\n\nnon-final cannot affect the procedural validity of EPA's decision\n\nto grant the permit.\"), the fact remains that EQB, by staying the\n\ncertification in  Puerto Rico Sun  Oil, took far more  timely and\n                                      \n\ndefinitive action than was ever  taken during the eleven and one-\n\nhalf  months (not  to mention  the ensuing  four years)  that EPA\n\nawaited EQB's promised review of the Caribbean certification.  \n\n          Finally, moving beyond the precedential shadow  cast by\n\nPuerto Rico  Sun Oil, Caribbean  has not identified (nor  can we)\n                    \n\nany other  potential manifestation  of  arbitrary and  capricious\n\nagency conduct on EPA's part.
