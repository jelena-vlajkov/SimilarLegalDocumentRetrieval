In  this   long-standing  class  action\r                            \r\n\ninvolving  prison conditions in Rhode Island, plaintiff Keith\r\n\nWerner  (a non-named  member of  the class)  appeals  from an\r\n\norder  denying his motion  to be  excluded from  a settlement\r\n\nagreement recently  adopted by the district court.  The class\r\n\nwas  certified back  in 1976  as one  under Fed.  R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n23(b)(2).    As  plaintiff  himself  concedes,  there  is  no\r\n\nautomatic  right to opt-out of  a Rule 23(b)(2)  class.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., Ticor  Title Ins. Co. v.  Brown, 114 S.

Even if the district court had discretion to permit\r\n\na  class  member  to  opt-out  in  this  context, see,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nCrawford v. Honig, 37 F.3d 485,  487 n.2 (9th Cir. 1994), the\r                             \r\n\nrefusal to  do so cannot be  deemed error in a  case, such as\r\n\nthis,  where only  equitable  relief has  been  sought.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nPalmigiano v. Garrahy,  443 F. Supp.  956, 959 (D.R.I.  1977)\r                                 \r\n\n(\"No  damages are sought in this action.\").  And the concerns\r\n\nunderlying plaintiff's  request prove misplaced in any event.\r\n\nWe decline to consider  the various constitutional challenges\r\n\nadvanced  on appeal to the absence of an opt-out procedure in\r\n\nRule 23(b)(2) proceedings,  inasmuch as  plaintiff failed  to\r\n\nraise  them below.   For  the same  reason, we  disregard his\r\n\nargument  that  the class  should  have  been decertified  or\r\n\nrestructured at some point in the past.\r\n\n     Assuming arguendo that plaintiff  has standing to  raise\r                                  \r\n\nthe issue, we also reject his perfunctory suggestion that the\r\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in adopting the  decree.\r\n\nHaving reviewed the agreement in full, we find its provisions\r\r\n\nto be \"fair, adequate,  and reasonable.\"  Durrett  v.
