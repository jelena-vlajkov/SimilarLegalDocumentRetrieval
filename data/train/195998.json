Appellant Alvaro Rojo-Alvarez appeals\r                                 \n\nfrom  the denial of his  motion to vacate  his sentence filed\n\nunder  28 U.S.C.   2255.   The motion  essentially raises two\n\ngrounds for relief:   (1) government undercover agents posing\n\nas buyers  engaged in  \"sentence entrapment\" in  violation of\n\nappellant's due process rights  by requesting a larger amount\n\nof  drugs  (30 kilograms  of  cocaine)  than appellant  could\n\nproduce; and (2)  counsel provided ineffective assistance  by\n\nnot  raising  this  issue at  the  sentencing  hearing.   The\n\ndistrict court  summarily dismissed  the motion on  the basis\n\nthat the  drug quantity  question had been  presented to  the\n\ndistrict court  at sentencing and  rejected by this  court on\n\ndirect appeal.   See United States v.  Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d\r                                                               \n\n959 (1st Cir. 1991).  The district court also determined that\n\ncounsel had  argued the entrapment defense  at the sentencing\n\nhearing.  We affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n          1.  Sentencing Factor Manipulation.1\r                                                        \n\n          Appellant argues  that he only had  the capacity to\n\ndeliver  9 kilograms  of cocaine,  the amount  the conspiracy\n\nactually produced for the  fictitious buyers.  The government\n\nused  the 30-kilogram  figure, appellant  maintains, only  to\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Because the phrase  \"sentence entrapment\" is  misleading,\nthis circuit uses the  term \"sentencing factor manipulation.\"\nUnited  States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 55 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993)\r                                      \n(latter   phrase  correctly  puts  emphasis  on  governmental\nconduct rather than on a defendant's predisposition to commit\nthe crime \"but for\" the government's inducement).\r\r\n\nraise his base offense level and, hence, his sentence.  There\n\nis no support in the record for this contention.  It is plain\n\nfrom the  uncontradicted trial testimony  that appellant  was\n\nnot  only  aware, from  the  beginning,  that the  conspiracy\n\ninvolved  30 kilograms  of  cocaine but  also  was an  active\n\nparticipant in the negotiations for this amount.\n\n               When, as  now, an offense-level\n               enhancement   results  from   a\n               matter  that  formed  part  and\n               parcel    of    the    original\n               negotiations      between     a\n               government   agent    and   his\n               target,   and   the    criminal\n               venture proceeds on that basis,\n               a  claim  of sentencing  factor\n               manipulation will not lie.\n\nUnited States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir. 1993).  As\r                                     \n\na  result  of  this   finding,  appellant's  claim  that  the\n\ngovernment's  conduct violated due process necessarily fails.\n\nSee United States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1272-73 (1st Cir.\r                                       \n\n1990) (conduct  must be so  shocking as to  be \"fundamentally\n\nunfair\" to amount to a violation of a defendant's due process\n\nrights).\n\n          Finally, to  the  extent that  appellant simply  is\n\nchallenging the finding,  for sentencing guideline  purposes,\n\nthat his  offense  involved 30  kilograms of  cocaine, he  is\n\nforeclosed  from  raising  this issue  in  a     2255 motion.\n\nFirst,  we   rejected  this  claim  on   direct  appeal  from\n\nappellant's conviction.  Rojo-Alvarez,  944 F.2d at 965, 971.\r                                                 \n\n\"Issues  disposed of on a  prior appeal will  not be reviewed\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nagain by way of a 2255 motion.\"  Tracey v.

Second, alleged  errors in  the application  of the\n\nguidelines to the facts generally are not cognizable under   \n\n2255.  Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 773-74 (1st Cir.\r                                          \n\n1994).\n\n          2.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.\r                                                           \n\n          Appellant claims that his attorney  failed to raise\n\nthe issue of sentencing factor manipulation.  However, as the\n\ndistrict  court noted,  counsel  specifically argued  at  the\n\nsentencing hearing  that  government  agents  should  not  be\n\nallowed  to choose a large  amount of drugs  when a defendant\n\nsuch  as appellant cannot produce  that amount.   Thus, it is\n\nplain  that  counsel's  conduct  was  more  than  objectively\n\nreasonable.    See Strickland  v.  Washington,  466 U.S.  668\r                                                         \n\n(1984).  In  any event, because we decide that this issue has\n\nno merit, appellant cannot demonstrate prejudice.
