This  case is an example of  the adage\r                                \r\n\nthat  haste makes  waste.   Angel Luis  Figueroa (\"Figueroa\")\r\n\nbrought  a suit  under  42 U.S.C.     1983 against  the  Drug\r\n\nEnforcement  Administration  (DEA)  and  two  of its  special\r\n\nagents,  alleging  that the  individual  defendants knowingly\r\n\nrelied  on false  information  in affidavits  used to  obtain\r\n\nforfeitures of  funds belonging to Figueroa.  In granting IFP\r\n\nstatus to  Figueroa, the  district court noted  that although\r\n\nthe  action was brought pursuant to section 1983, \"it must be\r\n\nconstrued  as  a  Bivens-type  action   .  .  .  because  the\r\n\ndefendants are federal, not  state, agents\" (citing to Bivens\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971)).\r                                       \r\n\n          The government  then  moved  for  judgment  on  the\r\n\npleadings or for summary judgment, urging as its first ground\r\n\nfor  dismissal that the DEA  agents were not  alleged to have\r\n\nacted under state law so that  no claim had been stated.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court  allowed  the  motion  for  judgment  on  the\r\n\npleadings, noting in the  margin order that \"  1983  does not\r\n\napply to D.E.A. Agents\" and  citing precedent to that effect.\r\n\nA motion for leave to amend, admittedly not mentioning Bivens\r                                                                         \r\n\nbut referring  to the jurisdictional statute  for asserting a\r\n\nBivens  claim,  was  denied.    On  appeal  by Figueroa,  the\r                  \r\n\ngovernment offers other defenses.\r\r\n\n          There  is no way to  avoid a remand.   The district\r\n\ncourt may well  have been misled by the  government's motion;\r\n\nbut having told Figueroa that his claim would be construed as\r\n\na Bivens action, the district court could not then dismiss on\r                    \r\n\nthe  ground that Figueroa had called it a section 1983 action\r\n\nin  the complaint.   If  the district  court wanted  a formal\r\n\namendment, it could  have insisted on  that, but an  outright\r\n\ndismissal in this situation without  leave to amend will  not\r\n\nwash.\r\n\n          The  government  appears  to  be  correct  that the\r\n\naction  against the DEA itself  is a suit  against the United\r\n\nStates, no waiver  of sovereign immunity has  been shown, and\r\n\naccordingly  the dismissal as to  it can be  affirmed on that\r\n\nground.  But despite the government's claims to the contrary,\r\n\nsovereign immunity  does not appear  to shield the  agents in\r\n\ntheir personal  capacities, see, e.g., Butz  v. Economou, 438\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  478, 501 (1978)  (Bivens actions  would be  \"drained of\r                                          \r\n\nmeaning  if  federal  officials  were  entitled  to  absolute\r\n\nimmunity for their constitutional  transgressions\") (internal\r\n\nquotation omitted), nor is  it likely that qualified immunity\r\n\nwould  do so if the  agents were engaged  in fraud or knowing\r\n\nfalsehood,  see, e.g.,  Malley v. Briggs,  475 U.S.  335, 341\r                                                    \r\n\n(1986)  (qualified  immunity  does  not  protect  \"those  who\r\n\nknowingly violate the law\").  Of course, we have no reason to\r\n\nthink  that they were so  engaged -- Figueroa's complaint and\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nsparse subsequent filings are utterly devoid of detail -- but\r\n\nthe complaint's  allegations must  be taken as  true for  the\r\n\nlimited purpose of this appeal.\r\n\n          The  government's  remaining alternative  ground is\r\n\nres  judicata,  based on  Figueroa's  failure  to pursue  his\r\n\npresent objections in the forfeiture proceedings.  If we were\r\n\ndealing  with clear law and clear facts we would give serious\r\n\nattention  to this issue  in order possibly  to avoid further\r\n\nproceedings in a busy district court.  But we know relatively\r\n\nlittle  about the  details  of the  forfeiture proceeding  or\r\n\nFigueroa's  role in it, and in rem forfeitures are a peculiar\r\n\nlegal  animal   whose  res  judicata  implications  are  more\r\n\ndifficult  to  determine  without   a  better  record.    See\r                                                                         \r\n\ngenerally Restatement (Second) of Judgments    22, 30 (1982).\r                     \r\n\n          Accordingly, we  affirm the judgment  in dismissing\r                                             \r\n\nthe  complaint against the DEA and vacate the dismissal as to\r                                                     \r\n\nthe named  agents in  their individual capacities  and remand\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe  case against  them  to the  district  court for  further\r\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\n          It is so ordered.\r                                      \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",

In his pro se complaint, plaintiff alleged that the defendants knowingly relied on false information in order to effect the seizure and subsequent forfeiture of various bank accounts held in his name.  The district court granted the government's motion under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(c) for judgment on the pleadings, finding that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983-the statutory authority cited by plaintiff-was inapplicable to federal officials not operating under color of state law.  Plaintiff's subsequent motion for reconsideration was summarily denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several aspects of this disposition prove problematic.  For one thing, the government's Rule 12(c) motion was premature.  The rule expressly provides that such relief can be sought only \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed.\"  Pleadings, of course, include an answer to the complaint.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 7(a).  Yet the defendants never filed an answer below.  See, e.g., 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1367, at 513 (\"defendant may not move under Rule 12(c) until after he has answered\").  In addition, the fact that the action was dismissed solely because of plaintiff's misplaced reliance on section 1983 is puzzling.  For in an earlier order granting IFP status, the district court had stated:  \"Although plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, it must be construed as a Bivens-type action, brought under the general federal question jurisdiction of the court, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, because the defendants are federal, not state, agents.\"  Order of July 2, 1992 (footnote omitted).  Given this pronouncement, plaintiff might justifiably have concluded that this deficiency in his complaint had been cured.  Furthermore, in his motion for reconsideration, plaintiff made specific reference to section 1331.  This can reasonably be construed as a request to amend his complaint to advance a Bivens cause of action.  Even though plaintiff was entitled to amend his complaint at that juncture as a matter of course, see Fed.  R. Civ. P. 15(a), the district court summarily denied the motion without examining the viability of any putative Bivens claim.  We therefore conclude that, both in granting the government's Rule 12(c) motion and in denying plaintiff's motion for reconsideration without leave to amend, the court abused its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the judgment is nonetheless sustainable inasmuch as any amendment to the complaint would obviously be futile.  We are unwilling to hazard such a prediction.  In particular, given the paucity of factual development to date, we are unable to conclude that plaintiff could make out no viable constitutional claim.  See generally D. Smith, Prosecution and Defense of Forfeiture Cases &#167; 10.05 (1993) (discussing applicability of Fourth Amendment in forfeiture context).  In light of plaintiff's assertion that the defendants deliberately relied on false information, we cannot say that the question of qualified immunity is necessarily foreclosed.   See, e.g., Schwob v. Catterson, 948 F.2d 1402, 1421-22 (3d Cir. 1991) (finding that issue of DEA agents' qualified immunity must await supplementation of the record).  Similarly, in part because an administrative forfeiture was apparently also involved here, we cannot rule out the possibility that the DEA's absolute immunity might be sidestepped in some fashion.   See, e.g., Sarit v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 987 F.2d 10, 17 (1st Cir. 1993) (discussing waiver of sovereign immunity under Administrative Procedures Act);   Onwubiko v. United States, 969 F.2d 1392, 1398-99 (2d Cir. 1992) (discussing jurisdiction under Tucker Act).  Finally, without even knowing the basis for plaintiff's August 1991 motion for relief from judgment in the forfeiture action, we are not prepared to conclude that his claim here-whatever form it may take-is barred on the ground of claim preclusion.   See, e.g., Wood v. Several Unknown Metrop.  Police Officers, 835 F.2d 340, 343-45 (D.C.
