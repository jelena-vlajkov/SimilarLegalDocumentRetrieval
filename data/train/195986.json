On  December  6, 1993,  appellant  Stanley\r                           \n\nLabovitz  pleaded guilty  to  thirteen  counts of  bankruptcy\n\nfraud.    Approximately  eleven  weeks  later,  still  before\n\nsentencing, appellant moved to withdraw his plea pursuant  to\n\nFed.  R.  Crim. P.  32(d).   The  district court  denied this\n\nmotion  and  subsequently  imposed  sentence.    This  appeal\n\nfollowed.  For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n     During the 1980's, appellant  was an attorney practicing\n\nbankruptcy and debt-collection law.   Appellant also invested\n\nin  real  estate, and  he  owned or  controlled  various real\n\nestate   entities   including  Hartwell   Realty  Corporation\n\n(\"Hartwell\"), 316 Main Street, Inc. (\"316 Main\"), and S.S.L.,\n\nInc. (\"S.S.L.\").   On April  27, 1993, a  federal grand  jury\n\nreturned  an indictment charging  appellant with twenty-three\n\ncounts  of bankruptcy  fraud.   See  18  U.S.C.    152.    In\r                                               \n\nparticular, the indictment charged appellant with engaging in\n\na scheme  to  defraud  by  filing  bankruptcy  petitions  for\n\nHartwell,  316  Main,  S.S.L.,  and  himself  personally, and\n\nthereafter   transferring   and  concealing   assets.     The\n\nindictment also charged him  with providing materially  false\n\ninformation in connection with these petitions.  \n\n     On  December  3, 1993,  appellant  entered  into a  plea\n\nagreement with the government under  which he agreed to plead\n\nguilty  to counts 1, 3, 7-8, 10, and 16-23 of the indictment.\n\nThe change of plea hearing was held on December 6,  1993.  At\n\nthe hearing,  the  prosecutor  summarized  the  evidence  the\n\ngovernment would have presented at trial.  The district court\r\r\n\naccepted  the change of plea  and set a  date for sentencing.\n\nOn  February 24, 1994,  appellant filed a  motion to withdraw\n\nhis guilty plea.  In his motion, he primarily argued that the\n\ndistrict  court's plea  colloquy  failed to  comply with  the\n\nrequirements of Fed.  R. Crim. P. 11.  Following a hearing on\n\nMarch 25, 1994, the district court orally denied  this motion\n\non  the grounds that  there is no  \"fair and just  reason\" to\n\nallow the withdrawal.\n\n       A  sentencing hearing was  conducted, and sentence was\n\nimposed, on June 16, 1994.  In the course of the hearing, the\n\ndistrict court made specific findings that the amount of loss\n\nwas $137,217.00 on Count 1; $34,356.67 on Count 7; $26,758.26\n\non Count 20, $5,206.89  on Count 21; and $25,000.00  on Count\n\n22.   As  a result,  the district  court, acting  pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1, adjusted  appellant's base offense level of\n\n6 upward by 8 levels to reflect a loss of between $200,000.00\n\nand  $350,000.00.1    The   court  imposed  a  fifteen  month\n\nsentence of  imprisonment, the  bottom end of  the applicable\n\nguideline range, followed by  a period of supervised release.\n\nThe court also ordered restitution of $231,573.67.    \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The  court then made a two level increase to reflect more\nthan minimal planning and a two level downward adjustment for\nacceptance of responsibility, to  reach a total offense level\nof 14.  Based on appellant's criminal history category I, his\nsentencing range was fifteen to twenty-one months.\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nA.   THE DENIAL OF  APPELLANT'S MOTION  TO WITHDRAW  HIS\n     GUILTY PLEA.\n\n     A district  court \"may  permit\" a defendant  to withdraw\n\nhis guilty plea prior  to sentencing for any \"fair  and just\"\n\nreason.   United States v. Daniels, 821 F.2d 76, 78 (1st Cir.\r                                              \n\n1987); Fed. R. Crim.  P. 32(d).  We have  recently reiterated\n\nthat:\n\n     There   are   several   factors  to   consider   in\n     determining  whether  a  defendant  has   met  this\n     burden, the  most significant  of which is  whether\n     the  plea was  knowing,  voluntary and  intelligent\n     within the meaning  of Rule 11.   The other factors\n     include:   1)  the  force and  plausibility of  the\n     proffered reason; 2) the  timing of the request; 3)\n     whether  the  defendant  has  asserted   his  legal\n     innocence; and 4) whether the parties had reached a\n     plea agreement.  \n\nUnited  States v. Cotal-Crespo, 1995 WL 27378 at *1 (1st Cir.\r                                          \n\nJan.  30, 1995)  (citations omitted).   We  will reverse  the\n\ndistrict court only for  an error of law or  for demonstrable\n\nabuse of  discretion.   Id.  at *3.   We  do  not think  that\r                                       \n\nreversal is warranted here.2\n\n     Appellant  argues  that  the  district  court  erred  in\n\nrequiring him to  provide a  \"strong\" rather  than \"fair  and\n\njust\" reason for withdrawal, and that it unfairly held him to\n\nthis  higher standard because he was an attorney.  We find no\n\nerror.   Appellant had  argued  below, inter  alia, that  the\r                                                              \n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  Arguably, an outright violation  of Rule 11 might require\nthe court to allow the withdrawal of a guilty plea unless the\nviolation was found  to be  harmless.  See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \nRaineri, 42 F.3d 36,  41 (1st Cir. 1994).   Here, however, we\r                   \nfind no violation of Rule 11 at all.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndistrict  court  failed  to  adequately inform  him  of,  and\n\ndetermine that he understood, the nature of the charges.  See\r                                                                         \n\nFed. R. Crim.  P. 11(c).  The district court  was entitled to\n\nconsider   appellant's   background  and   sophistication  in\n\ndetermining  whether  these core  concerns  of  Rule 11  were\n\nsatisfied.   See United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1245\r                                                    \n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (\"The manner in which the charge is explained\n\nand the method for determining  the defendant's understanding\n\nnecessarily  vary  from  case  to  case  depending  upon  the\n\ncapacity of the defendant and the attendant circumstances.\").\n\nThe  court's ruling on the motion to withdraw leaves no doubt\n\nthat  it  evaluated  the   motion  under  the  correct  legal\n\nstandard, and that it  denied the motion because it  found no\n\n\"fair and just\" reason for withdrawal.\n\n     Appellant also  argues that he should  have been allowed\n\nto withdraw  his guilty  plea because there  was insufficient\n\nfactual  basis  for it.   See  Fed. R.  Crim.  P. 11(f).   In\r                                         \n\nsupport of this argument,  he draws our attention to  various\n\nstatements  he made at the change of plea hearing which could\n\nbe  construed as denials  by him  that he  had the  intent to\n\ndefraud.   See United States v. Grant, 971 F.2d 799, 802 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir.  1992) (discussing  elements of  bankruptcy fraud).   In\n\naddition,  appellant cites to  various documents, appended to\n\nhis brief,  which he  suggests demonstrates his  innocence of\n\nthe crimes charged in counts 1 and 20.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n     It is well-settled  that the  prosecutor's statement  of\n\nfacts  on the record can satisfy the requirement of a factual\n\nbasis for  the plea.   See, e.g.,  United States v.  Ray, 828\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  399, 405-06 (7th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 964\r                                                           \n\n(1988).  This statement of  facts need not be uncontroverted.\n\nA  court may accept a  plea even when  the defendant protests\n\nhis innocence if there is a strong evidence in the record  of\n\nthe defendant's actual guilt.  North Carolina  v. Alford, 400\r                                                                    \n\nU.S. 25, 37 (1970); United States v. Walsh, 7 F.3d 1064, 1066\r                                                      \n\n(1st  Cir.  1993).     Similarly,  when  the  district  court\n\nestablishes  a sufficient factual  basis for the  plea at the\n\nRule  11 hearing,  the  guilty plea  may  stand even  if  the\n\ndefendant  later claims  innocence and  challenges the  plea.\n\nSee United States v. Keiswetter, 860 F.2d 992, 998 (10th Cir.\r                                           \n\n1988)  (Moore, J.,  dissenting); United  States v.  Owen, 858\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 1514, 1516-17 &amp; n.2 (11th Cir. 1988). \n\n     In the  instant case, the  prosecutor's proffer provided\n\nample factual basis for  accepting the guilty plea.   In this\n\nproffer,  the   prosecutor  detailed  a  lengthy  pattern  of\n\nomissions,   material   misstatements,   and   transfers   of\n\nbankruptcy  estate property  by appellant.   Given  the sheer\n\nnumber of  \"mistakes,\" the size of the  assets concealed, and\n\nappellant's  many years  of experience  practicing bankruptcy\n\nlaw,  we  think the  judge was  entitled  to conclude  that a\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nsubstantial  basis existed  for  believing  that  appellant's\n\nactions were knowing and fraudulent.3\n\n     The  documents that  appellant  cites do  not alter  our\n\nconclusion.     Count  1,  which  relates   to  the  Hartwell\n\nbankruptcy,  charged  appellant  with  failing   to  disclose\n\napproximately  $350,000.00 in  loans owing  to Hartwell  from\n\nappellant and his business  partner.  Appellant contends that\n\nthere can be no fraudulent intent since the final decision to\n\ntreat the  $350,000.00 as  a loan  to  officers (rather  than\n\ncompensation) was  not made until November  1991, roughly ten\n\nmonths  after  he  filed  Hartwell's   bankruptcy  petition.4\n\nHowever, appellant  should have  disclosed the asset  even if\n\nits status at the time  of filing was uncertain.   See United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Cherek, 734 F.2d 1248, 1254 (7th Cir. 1984) (\"It is\r                            \n\na reasonable reading of 18 U.S.C.   152 to conclude  that the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  We  add that  the district  judge made  a finding  on the\nrecord  that defendant's plea  of guilty is  \"supported by an\nindependent  basis  in  fact\"  for  each  of  the  \"essential\nelements\" of the offense charged.   We do not think that  the\njudge's   question  about  the  requisite  mental  state  for\nbankruptcy fraud,  asked at  a later proceeding,  warrants an\ninference that he was confused about this element and did not\nfulfill his duty under Rule 11(f).\n\n4.  In support  of this claim, appellant  draws our attention\nto two affidavits of Curtis Feldman, accountant for Hartwell.\nAlthough these affidavits are outside the record, we consider\nthe information  they contain because it was proffered to the\ndistrict court  at sentencing.   We  note, however,  that the\nremaining documents appellant cites in connection  with count\n1--Hartwell's   bankruptcy  petition   and  amendment--cannot\ninform our decision because  they are not part of  the record\non direct appeal.  See Fed. R. App. P. 10(a).\r                                  \n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nstatute  requires a  bankrupt  to disclose  the existence  of\n\nassets whose immediate status is uncertain.\"),  cert. denied,\r                                                                        \n\n471 U.S. 1014  (1985).  Moreover, appellant  did not disclose\n\nthe  asset  even  after  November 1991,  and  the  indictment\n\ncharged him  with a \"continuing failure\"  to disclose through\n\nOctober 1992.   Under  the circumstances, the  district court\n\ncould reasonably conclude that he was guilty.\n\n     Count   20,  which   relates  to   appellant's  personal\n\nbankruptcy,   charged   him    with   failing   to   disclose\n\napproximately  $25,000 worth  of  Keystone Fund  money market\n\nshares  which  he owned.    Appellant  contends that  various\n\ndocuments,  submitted to  the district  court  at sentencing,\n\nprove  his  lack  of  fraudulent  intent.    These  documents\n\nindicate  that in  February  1986,  appellant requested  that\n\nthese shares  be  transferred  to  his wife.    However,  the\n\ngovernment proffered evidence that appellant received monthly\n\nstatement and interest payments  from Keystone, mailed to his\n\nlaw  office,  both before  and  after  filing his  bankruptcy\n\npetition in May 1992.   Under the circumstances, there  was a\n\nstrong basis for concluding  that appellant knew the transfer\n\nhad not occurred and intended to conceal the asset.  The fact\n\nthat appellant  reported the asset to  the bankruptcy trustee\n\nin February  1993, two months  prior to his  indictment, does\n\nnot  alter our conclusion.   There is evidence  in the record\n\nwhich  suggests  that  he knew  by  then  that  he was  under\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ncriminal  investigation in connection with several bankruptcy\n\nfilings.\n\n     Finally,  having  determined that  appellant's principal\n\npoints are without merit, we consider the traditional factors\n\nrelevant  to the  review of  a change  of plea request.   The\n\nrecord reveals that appellant understood the substance of the\n\ncharges  against him, and suggests  that he made a calculated\n\ndecision that it was  in his interest to  plead guilty.   The\n\nplea  was  part  of  a  quid  pro  quo  negotiated  with  the\r                                                  \n\ngovernment.  See United  States v. Pellerito, 878  F.2d 1535,\r                                                        \n\n1541  (1st  Cir.  1989).   A  defendant  is  not entitled  to\n\nwithdraw  his  guilty  plea   simply  because  he  asserts  a\n\nsubjective  belief in  his innocence.   See United  States v.\r                                                                      \n\nRamos, 810 F.2d 308, 312 (1st Cir. 1987).  Given the totality\r                 \n\nof the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused\n\nits  discretion  in finding  no  \"fair and  just  reason\" for\n\nretraction.\n\n B.  INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\n\n     Ordinarily, we  do not address ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel  arguments  on  direct  appeal.    This  case  is  no\n\nexception.     Appellant  argues   that  trial   counsel  was\n\nineffective because he pressured him into pleading guilty and\n\nmisinformed him that it was too late to change his mind after\n\nsigning  the  plea  agreement.   These  charges  depend  upon\n\nevidentiary matters which are best considered by the district\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ncourt in  the first instance.   See United States  v. Mala, 7\r                                                                      \n\nF.3d  1058,  1063  (1st   Cir.  1993)  (holding  that  absent\n\nextraordinary circumstances, fact  specific claims  asserting\n\nineffective assistance  of  counsel  are  not  cognizable  on\n\ndirect  appeal),  cert.  denied,  114  S.  Ct.  1839  (1994).\r                                           \n\nAccordingly,  appellant's claim  of inadequate  assistance is\n\nnot properly before us.\n\nC.   SENTENCING.\n\n     1.  The District Court's Loss Calculation.\n\n     Appellant  argues  that  the  district  court  erred  in\n\ndetermining  the amount  of loss.   He  does not  contest the\n\ndistrict court's loss determination  of $34,456.67 for  count\n\n7.   However, he  contends  that there  was  no loss  at  all\n\ninvolved in counts  1, 20, 21, and 22.   Based on appellant's\n\nown calculation, the district  court should have adjusted the\n\nbase offense level  upward by 4 levels  to reflect a  loss of\n\nbetween $20,000.00  and $40,000.00,  rather than 8  levels to\n\nreflect a  loss of between  $200,000.00 and $350,000.00.   We\n\nfind no basis for a remand.\n\n     The  district court's loss  determination of $137,217.00\n\nfor  count  1  was  based   on  appellant's  portion  of  the\n\n$350,000.00  loan,  owing to  Hartwell,  which  he failed  to\n\ndisclose in Hartwell's bankruptcy documents.   Appellant does\n\nnot dispute that he  owed this amount to Hartwell.   Instead,\n\nhe contends that there was no  intended loss since it was not\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nfinally determined that the $137,217.00 was a loan and, thus,\n\na  corporate   asset,  until  some  months   after  he  filed\n\nHartwell's bankruptcy petition.  He further argues that there\n\nwas no actual loss to creditors because Hartwell's assets, at\n\nleast at the time of filing, exceeded its debts.\n\n     We  think the  district court  could properly  determine\n\nthat   there  was  both  an   intended  and  actual  loss  of\n\n$137,217.00.    The  court  could find  an  intended  loss of\n\n$137,217.00 because appellant continued to conceal this asset\n\neven  after,  by  his  own admission,  the  final  accounting\n\ndetermination  was made.  The court could find an actual loss\n\nof $137,217.00 because, independent of any loss to creditors,\n\nthat much remained owing to the debtor and bankruptcy  estate\n\nat the time  of sentencing.  See United States  v. Edgar, 971\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  89, 95 (8th Cir. 1992)  (recognizing that in bankruptcy\n\nfraud, the three entities that can be injured are the debtor,\n\nthe bankruptcy estate, and the creditors).5\n\n     The district court's loss determination of $26,758.26 on\n\ncount  20 was  based  on the  value  of the  Keystone  shares\n\nappellant  failed  to  disclose in  his  personal  bankruptcy\n\ndocuments.   Appellant does  not dispute  the value  of these\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  There might  be some complications with  the loss finding\nbecause  of appellant's  own stake  in Hartwell,  although we\nthink  those complications  might be  answered in  this case.\nThe  issue need  not  be pursued  because appellant  does not\nadvance  his ownership interest  in Hartwell as  a ground for\nlimiting the amount of loss.\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nshares.   Rather, he argues  that there was no  loss since he\n\ndisclosed  the  Keystone  Fund  to the  bankruptcy  court  in\n\nFebruary 1993,  two months before  his indictment.   We think\n\nthe district court  could properly find  an intended loss  of\n\n$26,758.26  for the  same reasons,  discussed above,  that it\n\ncould properly find an intent to defraud.  \n\n     Since appellant did not object at sentencing to the loss\n\ndetermination  of $5,206.89 on  count 21, we  review only for\n\nplain error.   Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).   Based on facts which\n\nwere uncontested below, the  court was entitled to  find that\n\nappellant  concealed his  one hundred  per cent  ownership of\n\nBass  River  Management,  Inc.   when  filing  for   personal\n\nbankruptcy, and  that he  later transferred this  amount from\n\nBass River for  his personal use.6   Under the circumstances,\n\nthere  was no  plain error in  determining the  loss to  be $\n\n5,206.89.  \n\n     We need not reach appellant's argument that the district\n\ncourt erred  in finding a loss  of $25,000 on count  22.  The\n\ntotal amount  of loss  involved in  counts 1,  7, 20, and  22\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.  Appellant  does  attempt to  dispute  on  appeal that  he\ntransferred  these funds  from  Bass River.   This  challenge\ncomes too late.   We have repeatedly held that  \"facts stated\nin presentence reports  are deemed admitted  if they are  not\nchallenged  in  the  district   court.\"    United  States  v.\r                                                                     \nO'Connor, 28  F.3d 218, 222  (1st Cir. 1994)  (quoting United\r                                                                         \nStates v. Bregnard, 951 F.2d  457, 460 (1st Cir. 1991)).   We\r                              \nadd that  the documents  appellant cites, copies  of canceled\nchecks written on Bass  Rivers' account, are not part  of the\nrecord on direct appeal. \n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nalready   falls   between   $200,000.00    and   $350,000.00.\n\nAccordingly, any error  in determining the loss for  count 22\n\nis harmless.\n\n     2.  Restitution.\n\n     Appellant  argues  that  the  district  court  erred  in\n\nfailing   to  determine   that  he   could  afford   to  make\n\nrestitution.   He  points out  that he  is  currently without\n\nemployment  and has limited assets.  Since this issue was not\n\npreserved below, we review  for plain error.  When  issuing a\n\nrestitution  order, the  district  court must  \"consider\" the\n\nfinancial condition of  the defendant.  18 U.S.C.    3664(a).\n\nHowever, there is no requirement  that the defendant be found\n\nable to pay now.  United States v. Lombardi, 5  F.3d 568, 573\r                                                       \n\n(1st  Cir.  1993).   Appellant  is  well-educated and  worked\n\nsuccessfully for many years.  There is every reason to expect\n\nthat he will be gainfully employed  in the future even if  he\n\nis unable to return  to the practice of law.   Significantly,\n\nthe district court left the payment schedule to be determined\n\nby  probation.   We  are  satisfied that  the  district court\n\nconsidered appellant's  financial situation, and that  it did\n\nnot abuse its considerable  discretion.  Accordingly, we find\n\nno plain error in the court's restitution order.\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n",

Approximately eleven weeks later, still before sentencing, appellant moved to withdraw his plea pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(d).  The district court denied this motion and subsequently imposed sentence.  This appeal followed.  For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the 1980's, appellant was an attorney practicing bankruptcy and debt-collection law.  Appellant also invested in real estate, and he owned or controlled various real estate entities including Hartwell Realty Corporation (\"Hartwell\"), 316 Main Street, Inc.  (\"316 Main\"), and S.S.L., Inc.  (\"S.S.L.\").  On April 27, 1993, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging appellant with twenty-three counts of bankruptcy fraud.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 152.  In particular, the indictment charged appellant with engaging in a scheme to defraud by filing bankruptcy petitions for Hartwell, 316 Main, S.S.L., and himself personally, and thereafter transferring and concealing assets.  The indictment also charged him with providing materially false information in connection with these petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1993, appellant entered into a plea agreement with the government under which he agreed to plead guilty to counts 1, 3, 7-8, 10, and 16-23 of the indictment.  The change of plea hearing was held on December 6, 1993.  At the hearing, the prosecutor summarized the evidence the government would have presented at trial.  The district court accepted the change of plea and set a date for sentencing.  On February 24, 1994, appellant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  In his motion, he primarily argued that the district court's plea colloquy failed to comply with the requirements of Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11.  Following a hearing on March 25, 1994, the district court orally denied this motion on the grounds that there is no \"fair and just reason\" to allow the withdrawal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing hearing was conducted, and sentence was imposed, on June 16, 1994.  In the course of the hearing, the district court made specific findings that the amount of loss was $137,217.00 on Count 1;  $34,356.67 on Count 7;  $26,758.26 on Count 20, $5,206.89 on Count 21;  and $25,000.00 on Count 22.  As a result, the district court, acting pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, adjusted appellant's base offense level of 6 upward by 8 levels to reflect a loss of between $200,000.00 and $350,000.00.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The court imposed a fifteen month sentence of imprisonment, the bottom end of the applicable guideline range, followed by a period of supervised release.  The court also ordered restitution of $231,573.67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>A.

United States v. Daniels, 821 F.2d 76, 78 (1st Cir. 1987);  Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(d).  We have recently reiterated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>There are several factors to consider in determining whether a defendant has met this burden, the most significant of which is whether the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent within the meaning of Rule 11.  The other factors include:  1) the force and plausibility of the proffered reason;  2) the timing of the request;  3) whether the defendant has asserted his legal innocence;  and 4) whether the parties had reached a plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 1995 WL 27378 at * 1 (1st Cir.  Jan. 30, 1995) (citations omitted).  We will reverse the district court only for an error of law or for demonstrable abuse of discretion.  Id. at * 3.  We do not think that reversal is warranted here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in requiring him to provide a \"strong\" rather than \"fair and just\" reason for withdrawal, and that it unfairly held him to this higher standard because he was an attorney.  We find no error.  Appellant had argued below, inter alia, that the district court failed to adequately inform him of, and determine that he understood, the nature of the charges.  See Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11(c).  The district court was entitled to consider appellant's background and sophistication in determining whether these core concerns of Rule 11 were satisfied.  See United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1245 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"The manner in which the charge is explained and the method for determining the defendant's understanding necessarily vary from case to case depending upon the capacity of the defendant and the attendant circumstances.\").  The court's ruling on the motion to withdraw leaves no doubt that it evaluated the motion under the correct legal standard, and that it denied the motion because it found no \"fair and just\" reason for withdrawal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because there was insufficient factual basis for it.  See Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11(f).  In support of this argument, he draws our attention to various statements he made at the change of plea hearing which could be construed as denials by him that he had the intent to defraud.  See United States v. Grant, 971 F.2d 799, 802 (1st Cir. 1992) (discussing elements of bankruptcy fraud).  In addition, appellant cites to various documents, appended to his brief, which he suggests demonstrates his innocence of the crimes charged in counts 1 and 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-settled that the prosecutor's statement of facts on the record can satisfy the requirement of a factual basis for the plea.  See, e.g., United States v. Ray, 828 F.2d 399, 405-06 (7th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 964 (1988).  This statement of facts need not be uncontroverted.  A court may accept a plea even when the defendant protests his innocence if there is a strong evidence in the record of the defendant's actual guilt.  North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 37 (1970);  United States v. Walsh, 7 F.3d 1064, 1066 (1st Cir. 1993).  Similarly, when the district court establishes a sufficient factual basis for the plea at the Rule 11 hearing, the guilty plea may stand even if the defendant later claims innocence and challenges the plea.  See United States v. Keiswetter, 860 F.2d 992, 998 (10th Cir. 1988) (Moore, J., dissenting);  United States v. Owen, 858 F.2d 1514, 1516-17 &amp; n.2 (11th Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the prosecutor's proffer provided ample factual basis for accepting the guilty plea.  In this proffer, the prosecutor detailed a lengthy pattern of omissions, material misstatements, and transfers of bankruptcy estate property by appellant.  Given the sheer number of \"mistakes,\" the size of the assets concealed, and appellant's many years of experience practicing bankruptcy law, we think the judge was entitled to conclude that a substantial basis existed for believing that appellant's actions were knowing and fraudulent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The documents that appellant cites do not alter our conclusion.  Count 1, which relates to the Hartwell bankruptcy, charged appellant with failing to disclose approximately $350,000.00 in loans owing to Hartwell from appellant and his business partner.  Appellant contends that there can be no fraudulent intent since the final decision to treat the $350,000.00 as a loan to officers (rather than compensation) was not made until November 1991, roughly ten months after he filed Hartwell's bankruptcy petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  However, appellant should have disclosed the asset even if its status at the time of filing was uncertain.  See United States v. Cherek, 734 F.2d 1248, 1254 (7th Cir. 1984) (\"It is a reasonable reading of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 152 to conclude that the statute requires a bankrupt to disclose the existence of assets whose immediate status is uncertain.\"), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1014 (1985).  Moreover, appellant did not disclose the asset even after November 1991, and the indictment charged him with a \"continuing failure\" to disclose through October 1992.  Under the circumstances, the district court could reasonably conclude that he was guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 20, which relates to appellant's personal bankruptcy, charged him with failing to disclose approximately $25,000 worth of Keystone Fund money market shares which he owned.  Appellant contends that various documents, submitted to the district court at sentencing, prove his lack of fraudulent intent.  These documents indicate that in February 1986, appellant requested that these shares be transferred to his wife.  However, the government proffered evidence that appellant received monthly statement and interest payments from Keystone, mailed to his law office, both before and after filing his bankruptcy petition in May 1992.  Under the circumstances, there was a strong basis for concluding that appellant knew the transfer had not occurred and intended to conceal the asset.  The fact that appellant reported the asset to the bankruptcy trustee in February 1993, two months prior to his indictment, does not alter our conclusion.  There is evidence in the record which suggests that he knew by then that he was under criminal investigation in connection with several bankruptcy filings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, having determined that appellant's principal points are without merit, we consider the traditional factors relevant to the review of a change of plea request.  The record reveals that appellant understood the substance of the charges against him, and suggests that he made a calculated decision that it was in his interest to plead guilty.  The plea was part of a quid pro quo negotiated with the government.  See United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1541 (1st Cir. 1989).  A defendant is not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea simply because he asserts a subjective belief in his innocence.  See United States v. Ramos, 810 F.2d 308, 312 (1st Cir. 1987).  Given the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in finding no \"fair and just reason\" for retraction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>B. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, we do not address ineffective assistance of counsel arguments on direct appeal.  This case is no exception.  Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because he pressured him into pleading guilty and misinformed him that it was too late to change his mind after signing the plea agreement.  These charges depend upon evidentiary matters which are best considered by the district court in the first instance.  See United States v.  Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that absent extraordinary circumstances, fact specific claims asserting ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1839 (1994).  Accordingly, appellant's claim of inadequate assistance is not properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>C.

The District Court's Loss Calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in determining the amount of loss.  He does not contest the district court's loss determination of $34,456.67 for count 7. However, he contends that there was no loss at all involved in counts 1, 20, 21, and 22.  Based on appellant's own calculation, the district court should have adjusted the base offense level upward by 4 levels to reflect a loss of between $20,000.00 and $40,000.00, rather than 8 levels to reflect a loss of between $200,000.00 and $350,000.00.  We find no basis for a remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's loss determination of $137,217.00 for count 1 was based on appellant's portion of the $350,000.00 loan, owing to Hartwell, which he failed to disclose in Hartwell's bankruptcy documents.  Appellant does not dispute that he owed this amount to Hartwell.  Instead, he contends that there was no intended loss since it was not finally determined that the $137,217.00 was a loan and, thus, a corporate asset, until some months after he filed Hartwell's bankruptcy petition.  He further argues that there was no actual loss to creditors because Hartwell's assets, at least at the time of filing, exceeded its debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the district court could properly determine that there was both an intended and actual loss of $137,217.00.  The court could find an intended loss of $137,217.00 because appellant continued to conceal this asset even after, by his own admission, the final accounting determination was made.  The court could find an actual loss of $137,217.00 because, independent of any loss to creditors, that much remained owing to the debtor and bankruptcy estate at the time of sentencing.  See United States v. Edgar, 971 F.2d 89, 95 (8th Cir. 1992) (recognizing that in bankruptcy fraud, the three entities that can be injured are the debtor, the bankruptcy estate, and the creditors).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's loss determination of $26,758.26 on count 20 was based on the value of the Keystone shares appellant failed to disclose in his personal bankruptcy documents.  Appellant does not dispute the value of these shares.  Rather, he argues that there was no loss since he disclosed the Keystone Fund to the bankruptcy court in February 1993, two months before his indictment.  We think the district court could properly find an intended loss of $26,758.26 for the same reasons, discussed above, that it could properly find an intent to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since appellant did not object at sentencing to the loss determination of $5,206.89 on count 21, we review only for plain error.  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 52(b).  Based on facts which were uncontested below, the court was entitled to find that appellant concealed his one hundred per cent ownership of Bass River Management, Inc. when filing for personal bankruptcy, and that he later transferred this amount from Bass River for his personal use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Under the circumstances, there was no plain error in determining the loss to be $ 5,206.89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach appellant's argument that the district court erred in finding a loss of $25,000 on count 22.  The total amount of loss involved in counts 1, 7, 20, and 22 already falls between $200,000.00 and $350,000.00.  Accordingly, any error in determining the loss for count 22 is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in failing to determine that he could afford to make restitution.  He points out that he is currently without employment and has limited assets.  Since this issue was not preserved below, we review for plain error.  When issuing a restitution order, the district court must \"consider\" the financial condition of the defendant.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3664(a).  However, there is no requirement that the defendant be found able to pay now.  United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 573 (1st Cir. 1993).  Appellant is well-educated and worked successfully for many years.  There is every reason to expect that he will be gainfully employed in the future even if he is unable to return to the practice of law.  Significantly, the district court left the payment schedule to be determined by probation.  We are satisfied that the district court considered appellant's financial situation, and that it did not abuse its considerable discretion.  Accordingly, we find no plain error in the court's restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court then made a two level increase to reflect more than minimal planning and a two level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, to reach a total offense level of 14.

Here, however, we find no violation of Rule 11 at all</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We add that the district judge made a finding on the record that defendant's plea of guilty is \"supported by an independent basis in fact\" for each of the \"essential elements\" of the offense charged.  We do not think that the judge's question about the requisite mental state for bankruptcy fraud, asked at a later proceeding, warrants an inference that he was confused about this element and did not fulfill his duty under Rule 11(f)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In support of this claim, appellant draws our attention to two affidavits of Curtis Feldman, accountant for Hartwell.  Although these affidavits are outside the record, we consider the information they contain because it was proffered to the district court at sentencing.  We note, however, that the remaining documents appellant cites in connection with count 1-Hartwell's bankruptcy petition and amendment-cannot inform our decision because they are not part of the record on direct appeal.

Approximately eleven weeks later, still before sentencing, appellant moved to withdraw his plea pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(d).  The district court denied this motion and subsequently imposed sentence.  This appeal followed.  For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the 1980's, appellant was an attorney practicing bankruptcy and debt-collection law.  Appellant also invested in real estate, and he owned or controlled various real estate entities including Hartwell Realty Corporation (\"Hartwell\"), 316 Main Street, Inc.  (\"316 Main\"), and S.S.L., Inc.  (\"S.S.L.\").  On April 27, 1993, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging appellant with twenty-three counts of bankruptcy fraud.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 152.  In particular, the indictment charged appellant with engaging in a scheme to defraud by filing bankruptcy petitions for Hartwell, 316 Main, S.S.L., and himself personally, and thereafter transferring and concealing assets.  The indictment also charged him with providing materially false information in connection with these petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1993, appellant entered into a plea agreement with the government under which he agreed to plead guilty to counts 1, 3, 7-8, 10, and 16-23 of the indictment.  The change of plea hearing was held on December 6, 1993.  At the hearing, the prosecutor summarized the evidence the government would have presented at trial.  The district court accepted the change of plea and set a date for sentencing.  On February 24, 1994, appellant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  In his motion, he primarily argued that the district court's plea colloquy failed to comply with the requirements of Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11.  Following a hearing on March 25, 1994, the district court orally denied this motion on the grounds that there is no \"fair and just reason\" to allow the withdrawal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing hearing was conducted, and sentence was imposed, on June 16, 1994.  In the course of the hearing, the district court made specific findings that the amount of loss was $137,217.00 on Count 1;  $34,356.67 on Count 7;  $26,758.26 on Count 20, $5,206.89 on Count 21;  and $25,000.00 on Count 22.  As a result, the district court, acting pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, adjusted appellant's base offense level of 6 upward by 8 levels to reflect a loss of between $200,000.00 and $350,000.00.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The court imposed a fifteen month sentence of imprisonment, the bottom end of the applicable guideline range, followed by a period of supervised release.  The court also ordered restitution of $231,573.67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>A.

We have recently reiterated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>There are several factors to consider in determining whether a defendant has met this burden, the most significant of which is whether the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent within the meaning of Rule 11.

We find no error.  Appellant had argued below, inter alia, that the district court failed to adequately inform him of, and determine that he understood, the nature of the charges.  See Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11(c).  The district court was entitled to consider appellant's background and sophistication in determining whether these core concerns of Rule 11 were satisfied.  See United States v. Allard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556604\"><a href=\"/opinion/556604/united-states-v-raymond-p-allard/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span>, 1245 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"The manner in which the charge is explained and the method for determining the defendant's understanding necessarily vary from case to case depending upon the capacity of the defendant and the attendant circumstances.\").  The court's ruling on the motion to withdraw leaves no doubt that it evaluated the motion under the correct legal standard, and that it denied the motion because it found no \"fair and just\" reason for withdrawal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because there was insufficient factual basis for it.  See Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11(f).  In support of this argument, he draws our attention to various statements he made at the change of plea hearing which could be construed as denials by him that he had the intent to defraud.  See United States v. Grant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588107\"><a href=\"/opinion/588107/united-states-v-john-a-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span>, 802 (1st Cir. 1992) (discussing elements of bankruptcy fraud).  In addition, appellant cites to various documents, appended to his brief, which he suggests demonstrates his innocence of the crimes charged in counts 1 and 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-settled that the prosecutor's statement of facts on the record can satisfy the requirement of a factual basis for the plea.  See, e.g., United States v. Ray, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493938\"><a href=\"/opinion/493938/united-states-v-latroy-d-ray-johnny-lee-may-and-boyd-mcchristion/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 405-06 (7th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">964</span> </span>(1988).  This statement of facts need not be uncontroverted.  A court may accept a plea even when the defendant protests his innocence if there is a strong evidence in the record of the defendant's actual guilt.  North Carolina v. Alford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108215\"><a href=\"/opinion/108215/north-carolina-v-alford/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 37 (1970);  United States v.

Similarly, when the district court establishes a sufficient factual basis for the plea at the Rule 11 hearing, the guilty plea may stand even if the defendant later claims innocence and challenges the plea.  See United States v. Keiswetter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513489\"><a href=\"/opinion/513489/united-states-v-laurence-keiswetter/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 998 (10th Cir. 1988) (Moore, J., dissenting);  United States v.

In this proffer, the prosecutor detailed a lengthy pattern of omissions, material misstatements, and transfers of bankruptcy estate property by appellant.  Given the sheer number of \"mistakes,\" the size of the assets concealed, and appellant's many years of experience practicing bankruptcy law, we think the judge was entitled to conclude that a substantial basis existed for believing that appellant's actions were knowing and fraudulent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The documents that appellant cites do not alter our conclusion.  Count 1, which relates to the Hartwell bankruptcy, charged appellant with failing to disclose approximately $350,000.00 in loans owing to Hartwell from appellant and his business partner.  Appellant contends that there can be no fraudulent intent since the final decision to treat the $350,000.00 as a loan to officers (rather than compensation) was not made until November 1991, roughly ten months after he filed Hartwell's bankruptcy petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  However, appellant should have disclosed the asset even if its status at the time of filing was uncertain.  See United States v. Cherek, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435975\"><a href=\"/opinion/435975/united-states-v-leonard-r-cherek/\"><span class=\"volume\">734</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span>, 1254 (7th Cir. 1984) (\"It is a reasonable reading of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 152 to conclude that the statute requires a bankrupt to disclose the existence of assets whose immediate status is uncertain.\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1014</span> </span>(1985).  Moreover, appellant did not disclose the asset even after November 1991, and the indictment charged him with a \"continuing failure\" to disclose through October 1992.  Under the circumstances, the district court could reasonably conclude that he was guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 20, which relates to appellant's personal bankruptcy, charged him with failing to disclose approximately $25,000 worth of Keystone Fund money market shares which he owned.  Appellant contends that various documents, submitted to the district court at sentencing, prove his lack of fraudulent intent.  These documents indicate that in February 1986, appellant requested that these shares be transferred to his wife.  However, the government proffered evidence that appellant received monthly statement and interest payments from Keystone, mailed to his law office, both before and after filing his bankruptcy petition in May 1992.  Under the circumstances, there was a strong basis for concluding that appellant knew the transfer had not occurred and intended to conceal the asset.  The fact that appellant reported the asset to the bankruptcy trustee in February 1993, two months prior to his indictment, does not alter our conclusion.  There is evidence in the record which suggests that he knew by then that he was under criminal investigation in connection with several bankruptcy filings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, having determined that appellant's principal points are without merit, we consider the traditional factors relevant to the review of a change of plea request.  The record reveals that appellant understood the substance of the charges against him, and suggests that he made a calculated decision that it was in his interest to plead guilty.  The plea was part of a quid pro quo negotiated with the government.  See United States v. Pellerito, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526038\"><a href=\"/opinion/526038/united-states-v-giuseppe-pellerito-aka-joseph-el-italiano-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1535</span></a></span>, 1541 (1st Cir. 1989).  A defendant is not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea simply because he asserts a subjective belief in his innocence.  See United States v. Ramos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482471\"><a href=\"/opinion/482471/united-states-v-hector-acevedo-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 312 (1st Cir. 1987).  Given the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in finding no \"fair and just reason\" for retraction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>B. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, we do not address ineffective assistance of counsel arguments on direct appeal.  This case is no exception.  Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because he pressured him into pleading guilty and misinformed him that it was too late to change his mind after signing the plea agreement.  These charges depend upon evidentiary matters which are best considered by the district court in the first instance.  See United States v.  Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that absent extraordinary circumstances, fact specific claims asserting ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He does not contest the district court's loss determination of $34,456.67 for count 7. However, he contends that there was no loss at all involved in counts 1, 20, 21, and 22.  Based on appellant's own calculation, the district court should have adjusted the base offense level upward by 4 levels to reflect a loss of between $20,000.00 and $40,000.00, rather than 8 levels to reflect a loss of between $200,000.00 and $350,000.00.  We find no basis for a remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's loss determination of $137,217.00 for count 1 was based on appellant's portion of the $350,000.00 loan, owing to Hartwell, which he failed to disclose in Hartwell's bankruptcy documents.  Appellant does not dispute that he owed this amount to Hartwell.  Instead, he contends that there was no intended loss since it was not finally determined that the $137,217.00 was a loan and, thus, a corporate asset, until some months after he filed Hartwell's bankruptcy petition.  He further argues that there was no actual loss to creditors because Hartwell's assets, at least at the time of filing, exceeded its debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the district court could properly determine that there was both an intended and actual loss of $137,217.00.  The court could find an intended loss of $137,217.00 because appellant continued to conceal this asset even after, by his own admission, the final accounting determination was made.  The court could find an actual loss of $137,217.00 because, independent of any loss to creditors, that much remained owing to the debtor and bankruptcy estate at the time of sentencing.  See United States v. Edgar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587660\"><a href=\"/opinion/587660/united-states-v-james-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 95 (8th Cir. 1992) (recognizing that in bankruptcy fraud, the three entities that can be injured are the debtor, the bankruptcy estate, and the creditors).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's loss determination of $26,758.26 on count 20 was based on the value of the Keystone shares appellant failed to disclose in his personal bankruptcy documents.  Appellant does not dispute the value of these shares.  Rather, he argues that there was no loss since he disclosed the Keystone Fund to the bankruptcy court in February 1993, two months before his indictment.  We think the district court could properly find an intended loss of $26,758.26 for the same reasons, discussed above, that it could properly find an intent to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since appellant did not object at sentencing to the loss determination of $5,206.89 on count 21, we review only for plain error.  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 52(b).  Based on facts which were uncontested below, the court was entitled to find that appellant concealed his one hundred per cent ownership of Bass River Management, Inc. when filing for personal bankruptcy, and that he later transferred this amount from Bass River for his personal use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Under the circumstances, there was no plain error in determining the loss to be $ 5,206.89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach appellant's argument that the district court erred in finding a loss of $25,000 on count 22.  The total amount of loss involved in counts 1, 7, 20, and 22 already falls between $200,000.00 and $350,000.00.  Accordingly, any error in determining the loss for count 22 is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in failing to determine that he could afford to make restitution.  He points out that he is currently without employment and has limited assets.  Since this issue was not preserved below, we review for plain error.  When issuing a restitution order, the district court must \"consider\" the financial condition of the defendant.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3664(a).  However, there is no requirement that the defendant be found able to pay now.  United States v. Lombardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 573 (1st Cir. 1993).  Appellant is well-educated and worked successfully for many years.  There is every reason to expect that he will be gainfully employed in the future even if he is unable to return to the practice of law.  Significantly, the district court left the payment schedule to be determined by probation.  We are satisfied that the district court considered appellant's financial situation, and that it did not abuse its considerable discretion.  Accordingly, we find no plain error in the court's restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court then made a two level increase to reflect more than minimal planning and a two level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, to reach a total offense level of 14.  Based on appellant's criminal history category I, his sentencing range was fifteen to twenty-one months</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Arguably, an outright violation of Rule 11 might require the court to allow the withdrawal of a guilty plea unless the violation was found to be harmless.  See United States v. Raineri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195774\"><a href=\"/opinion/195774/united-states-v-raineri/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir. 1994).  Here, however, we find no violation of Rule 11 at all</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We add that the district judge made a finding on the record that defendant's plea of guilty is \"supported by an independent basis in fact\" for each of the \"essential elements\" of the offense charged.  We do not think that the judge's question about the requisite mental state for bankruptcy fraud, asked at a later proceeding, warrants an inference that he was confused about this element and did not fulfill his duty under Rule 11(f)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In support of this claim, appellant draws our attention to two affidavits of Curtis Feldman, accountant for Hartwell.  Although these affidavits are outside the record, we consider the information they contain because it was proffered to the district court at sentencing.  We note, however, that the remaining documents appellant cites in connection with count 1-Hartwell's bankruptcy petition and amendment-cannot inform our decision because they are not part of the record on direct appeal.  See Fed.  R. App.  P. 10(a)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> There might be some complications with the loss finding because of appellant's own stake in Hartwell, although we think those complications might be answered in this case.  The issue need not be pursued because appellant does not advance his ownership interest in Hartwell as a ground for limiting the amount of loss</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Appellant does attempt to dispute on appeal that he transferred these funds from Bass River.  This challenge comes too late.  We have repeatedly held that \"facts stated in presentence reports are deemed admitted if they are not challenged in the district court.\"  United States v. O'Connor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195444\"><a href=\"/opinion/195444/united-states-v-oconnor/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v. Bregnard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573880\"><a href=\"/opinion/573880/united-states-v-dale-m-bregnard/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 460 (1st Cir. 1991)).  We add that the documents appellant cites, copies of canceled checks written on Bass Rivers' account, are not part of the record on direct appeal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
