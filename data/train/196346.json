Pro se plaintiff Maurice Young appeals\r                                         \r\n\na  district court  judgment that  dismissed his  complaint as\r\n\nfrivolous  within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1915(d).  We have\r\n\nthoroughly  reviewed the  record and  the parties'  briefs on\r\n\nappeal.  We are persuaded  that the district court's judgment\r\n\nwas correct.  The  plaintiff's amended complaint purported to\r\n\nstate  claims under  42 U.S.C.   1983 for  violations  of the\r\n\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments' due  process requirement and\r\n\nthe  Fourth Amendment  right  to be  free from  \"unreasonable\r\n\nseizures.\"  These claims were based on the alleged actions of\r\n\ndefendant Hansen, the  deputy sheriff who  arrested plaintiff\r\n\nand allegedly  committed perjury while testifying against the\r\n\nplaintiff at his state criminal trial.\r\n\n          Insofar as plaintiff seeks  to recover for Hansen's\r\n\nalleged perjury, his claim is barred by Briscoe v. LaHue, 460\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  325 (1983)(holding all  witnesses are absolutely immune\r\n\nfrom  civil  suit  under   1983,  including  those  who  give\r\n\nperjured testimony).  Insofar  as the complaint seeks damages\r\n\nfor violation of plaintiff's  Fifth and Fourteenth  Amendment\r\n\nrights to procedural due process, the claim is barred because\r\n\nthe  plaintiff  has  adequate  remedies at  state  law.  \"[A]\r\n\nprocedural  due  process claim  may  not  be redressed  under\r\n\nsection 1983 where an adequate state remedy exists.\"  Reid v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nNew Hampshire,  56 F.3d 332, 341  (1st Cir. 1995).   As Maine\r                         \r\n\nrecognizes the common law torts of false arrest and malicious\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nprosecution, see, e.g.,  Nadeau v. State,  395 A.2d 107,  116\r                                                    \r\n\n(Me.  1978);  Qualey v.  Town of  Wilton,  540 A.2d  479 (Me.\r                                                    \r\n\n1988), plaintiff  has adequate post-deprivation  remedies and\r\n\nmay not  recover for the alleged violation  of procedural due\r\n\nprocess under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  See Reid, 56 F.3d at 341.  To\r                                                    \r\n\nthe extent  that plaintiff alleges violations  of substantive\r\n\ndue  process, Albright v. Oliver, 114 S. Ct. 807 (1994), bars\r                                            \r\n\nhis claim.                                    Plaintiff's\r\n\nclaim  for the  alleged violation  of the  Fourth Amendment's\r\n\nprohibition  against unreasonable  seizures  is barred  as  a\r\n\nmatter of law  for different reasons.  The  plaintiff alleged\r\n\nthat defendant Hansen arrested him without probable cause for\r\n\noperating under  the influence (OUI) and  operating after his\r\n\nlicense had been  revoked (OAR).  Plaintiff  has submitted an\r\n\narrest report which indicates that Hansen arrested him on the\r\n\nforegoing  charges  and  for  illegal  attachment of  license\r\n\nplates.  The plaintiff claims that after a jury deadlocked at\r\n\nhis  criminal trial  on the  OUI and  OAR charges,  the state\r\n\nreduced these charges to  illegally attaching license  plates\r\n\nand allowing his motor vehicle to be driven (presumably, with\r\n\nthe  illegal plates).    The plaintiff does  not contend that\r\n\nprobable  cause  was   lacking  for  these  latter   charges.\r\n\n\"Probable  cause need only exist as to any offense that could\r\n\nbe  charged under the circumstances.\" Barna  v. City of Perth\r                                                                         \r\n\nAmboy,  42 F.3d 809, 819 (3rd Cir.  1994).  See also Barry v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nFowler, 902  F.2d 770, 773  n. 5 (9th Cir.  1990); Edwards v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCity   of  Philadelphia,   860  F.2d   568,  576   (3rd  Cir.\r                                   \r\n\n1988)(similar).    Where  plaintiff  does  not  contend  that\r\n\nprobable  cause  was  lacking  for  his  arrest  for  illegal\r\n\nattachment  of  license  plates,  he cannot  recover  for  an\r\n\nunreasonable seizure,  even if probable cause  was lacking on\r\n\nthe OUI and OAR charges.  Accordingly, as plaintiff's federal\r\n\nclaims lack  an  arguable basis  in law,  they were  properly\r\n\ndismissed as  frivolous.  See  Neitzke v. Williams,  490 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n319, 325 (1989).  \r\n\n          There was  no separate discussion of  the state law\r\n\nclaims by the  district court.   As plaintiff  has failed  to\r\n\nallege claims  that would  support federal  jurisdiction, his\r\n\nstate law claims were  also subject to dismissal for  lack of\r\n\njurisdiction.   See United Mine  Workers v.  Gibbs, 383  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n715,  726-27 (1966).  However,  these claims should have been\r\n\ndismissed without  prejudice.  See Figueroa  Ruiz v. Alegria,\r                                                                        \r\n\n896 F.2d 645, 650 (1st Cir. 1990).  Accordingly, the judgment\r\n\nof the district  court is  affirmed insofar  as it  dismisses\r                                               \r\n\nplaintiff's federal  claims (i.e., counts 1-4  of plaintiff's\r\n\namended complaint) as frivolous.   We vacate the dismissal of\r                                                        \r\n\nplaintiff's  state  law  claims  (i.e., counts  5-13  of  the\r\n\namended  complaint) and remand  with instructions  that these\r                                          \r\n\nclaims  be dismissed  without prejudice  for lack  of federal\r\n\njurisdiction.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          It is so ordered.\r                                      \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

City of Philadelphia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513429\"><a href=\"/opinion/513429/douglas-edwards-v-city-of-philadelphia-and-officer-haworth-james-badge/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 576 (3rd Cir.1988)(similar).  Where plaintiff does not contend that probable cause was lacking for his arrest for illegal attachment of license plates, he cannot recover for an unreasonable seizure, even if probable cause was lacking on the OUI and OAR charges.  Accordingly, as plaintiff's federal claims lack an arguable basis in law, they were properly dismissed as frivolous.  See Neitzke v. Williams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112254\"><a href=\"/opinion/112254/neitzke-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 325 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no separate discussion of the state law claims by the district court.  As plaintiff has failed to allege claims that would support federal jurisdiction, his state law claims were also subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.  See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107200\"><a href=\"/opinion/107200/mine-workers-v-gibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 726-27 (1966).  However, these claims should have been dismissed without prejudice.  See Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536977\"><a href=\"/opinion/536977/rafael-figueroa-ruiz-v-jose-e-alegria/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 650 (1st Cir.1990).  Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed insofar as it dismisses plaintiff's federal claims (i.e., counts 1-4 of plaintiff's amended complaint) as frivolous.  We vacate the dismissal of plaintiff's state law claims (i.e., counts 5-13 of the amended complaint) and remand with instructions that these claims be dismissed without prejudice for lack of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
