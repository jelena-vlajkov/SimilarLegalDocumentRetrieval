Under  a  program authorized  by  the National\r\n\nHousing  Act  (\"NHA\"), 12  U.S.C.     1701,  1709, 1715k  et seq.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(1994);  24 C.F.R   250.1 (1994), the United States Department of\r\n\nHousing and  Urban Development (\"HUD\") coinsured the non-recourse\r\n\nmortgage  loan.1  In order to qualify for HUD coinsurance, Indian\r\n\nMotocycle  signed  a  \"Regulatory Agreement,\"  obligating  it  to\r\n\ncomply with pertinent HUD  regulations and conditions whereby the\r\n\nindividual  Indian Motocycle partners  assumed personal liability\r\n\n\"for funds or property of the Project which come into their hands\r\n\nand which they are  not entitled to retain;  and . . .  for their\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1NHA coinsurance  permits the  private lender to  assign its\r\nnote  and mortgage to HUD if unable to collect from the borrower.\r\nSee 12 U.S.C.   1710.\r             \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nown acts and  deeds or acts and deeds  of their authorized agents\r\n\nthat are in violation  of the provisions of this Agreement.\"  The\r\n\nRegulatory Agreement is incorporated into the mortgage by express\r\n\nreference.\r\n\n          In addition to conveying a  first mortgage on all  real\r\n\nproperty belonging to the  Project, Indian Motocycle assigned all\r\n\nits  Project leases, rents, profits  and income to  MHFA \"for the\r\n\npurpose of discharging the [note].\"   See Mortgage   4; 12 U.S.C.\r                                                   \r\n\n  1715k(d)(2)(A).   MHFA in  turn authorized Indian  Motocycle to\r\n\ncollect and apply Project rents to enumerated purposes, including\r\n\nloan repayments and \"reasonable  expenses necessary to the opera-\r\n\ntion and  maintenance of the  Project.\"   Regulatory Agreement   \r\n\n3(b). Indian Motocycle's right to collect Project rents terminat-\r\n\ned upon default.  See Mortgage   4.  In the event the debtor were\r                               \r\n\nto breach the Regulatory Agreement, MHFA or HUD would be entitled\r\n\nto seek specific performance,  injunctive relief, or the appoint-\r\n\nment of a receiver for the Project.  See  Regulatory Agreement   \r                                                  \r\n\n17-18. The  mortgage and Regulatory Agreement  were duly recorded\r\n\nby MHFA. \r\n\n          In 1989,  Indian  Motocycle transferred  its  ownership\r\n\ninterest  in  the  Project  to Indian  Motocycle  Associates  III\r\n\nLimited Partnership, which assumed the MHFA note and mortgage; in\r\n\nAugust 1992,  it  defaulted.   MHFA promptly  tendered notice  of\r\n\ndefault  but took no immediate steps to acquire possession of the\r\n\nProject (as by foreclosure) or the rents (as  by appointment of a\r\n\nreceiver).   Meanwhile, Indian Motocycle  Associates III  Limited\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nPartnership had withdrawn  $65,000 from the  rents on deposit  in\r\n\nthe  Project  operating  accounts,  with which,  inter  alia,  it\r                                                                      \r\n\nretained  counsel  in  contemplation  of the  commencement  of  a\r\n\nvoluntary chapter 11 proceeding ($35,000 retainer) and an accoun-\r\n\ntant  (Coopers &amp; Lybrand) to  prepare a prepetition  audit of the\r\n\nProject  ($20,000).2    On  December 15,  1992,  following  these\r\n\ndisbursements, Indian Motocycle  Associates III Limited  Partner-\r\n\nship (hereinafter:   \"debtor\") filed its chapter 11  petition and\r\n\ncontinued  to operate  the Project  as a  debtor in  possession.3\r\n\nPursuant to  the Regulatory  Agreement,  MHFA filed  a motion  to\r\n\ncompel the  debtor \"to restore  [the $65,000 in  cash collateral]\r\n\nimproperly diverted from the [chapter 11] estate in  violation of\r\n\nTitle II of the [NHA].\"4  \r\n\nB.

See infra notes 18 &amp; 20.\r                                                       \r\n\n     3The  chapter  11 proceeding  has  since  been converted  to\r\nchapter 7,  see Bankruptcy Code    1112, 11 U.S.C.    1112, and a\r                         \r\nchapter 7 trustee has been appointed, id.   702.\r                                                   \r\n\n     4At the same time, MHFA sought to sequester all postpetition\r\nrents.   Thereafter, on June 23, 1993,  prior to denying the MHFA\r\nmotion to  compel, the bankruptcy  court granted an  interim MHFA\r\nmotion for relief from the automatic stay.  See Bankruptcy Code  \r                                                         \r\n362(d), 11 U.S.C.    362(d).   MHFA represents that it  has since\r\nforeclosed  upon all  collateral except  the  monies at  issue on\r\nappeal.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncounsel violated the  Regulatory Agreement.

Mass. 1994).5   The  court nonetheless  denied the  motion to\r\n\ncompel the debtor  to restore  the $65,000 to  MHFA, noting  that\r\n\nRegulatory Agreement violations by the debtor were  \"irrelevant,\"\r\n\ngiven  that the motion to compel purported to assert MHFA's legal\r\n\nrights against the debtor  only and that no  adversary proceeding\r\n\nhad  yet been  commenced against  the debtor's  general partners,\r\n\nattorneys or accountants, the transferees  in possession.

The bankruptcy  court reasoned, however, that  the requested\r             \r\n\nrelief would undermine the Bankruptcy Code distribution scheme by\r\n\nentitling  $65,000 of  the HUD/MHFA  unsecured claim  against the\r\n\nchapter 11 estate to \"super priority\" status.  \r\n\n          On intermediate appeal, the district court reversed and\r\n\nremanded to the bankruptcy court for entry of an order compelling\r\n\nthe  \"[d]ebtor to  restore  the distributions  diverted from  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5The  bankruptcy court  traced the  source of  the contested\r\nmonies directly to Project rents, as distinguished from individu-\r\nal partner advances as suggested by the debtor.

The\r\n\ndebtor argues  that it no  longer retained a  property \"interest\"\r\n\nin, or control over, the diverted collateral on the date it filed\r\n\nits chapter  11 petition  and, accordingly, the  collateral never\r\n\nbecame property of the chapter 11 estate  amenable to administra-\r\n\ntion.  See Bankruptcy Code   541(a)(1), (6),  11 U.S.C.   541(a)-\r                    \r\n\n(1), (6) (providing  that estate  is comprised of  \"all legal  or\r\n\nequitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commence-\r                                                                           \r\n\nment of the case,\" including \"rents . . . from [real] property of\r                          \r\n\nthe  estate\") (emphasis  added).

Finally, the debtor argues that  the bankruptcy court\r\n\ncorrectly  declined to  follow  those courts  which have  ordered\r\n\nchapter  11 debtors in possession to restore to the debtor estate\r\n\ndiverted  NHA-encumbered rents, see  infra Section  II.A.2, since\r                                                    \r\n\nthose cases did not  involve a non-federal agency like  MHFA, nor\r\n\ndid  those courts  cite  to legislative  history indicating  that\r\n\nCongress intended that NHA  policy override the debtor protection\r\n\npolicy  underlying the  Bankruptcy Code,  including the  right to\r\n\nutilize  monies in  the debtor's  possession to  fund prepetition\r\n\nretainers of chapter 11 counsel.  \r\n\nA.

To the extent this ruling suggests that MHFA sustained no\r\n\ncognizable injury, we  disagree.   Since there  is no  indication\r\n\nthat  MHFA's claim was over-secured, the conversion by the debtor\r\n\nof the  $65,000 cash collateral  reduced MHFA's secured  claim by\r\n\nthat amount, leaving  MHFA with an  unsecured claim for  $65,000.\r\n\nSee Bankruptcy  Code   506(a), (b), 11  U.S.C.   506(a), (b); see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso id.    541(a)(6) (\"Such estate is comprised of  . . .

Since\r\n\nthe rents  constituted \"cash collateral\" securing  the MHFA note,\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nid.   363(a)  (\"cash collateral\"  includes \"cash .  . .  whenever\r             \r\n\nacquired in which the  estate and an entity other than the estate\r\n\nhave an interest and  includes . . . rents  . . . .\"); cf.  id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n552(b) (governing enforceability of prepetition security interest\r\n\nagainst  postpetition  rents),  the  rents could  not  have  been\r\n\nexpended or transferred without MHFA consent, id.   363(c)(2)(A),\r                                                           \r\n\nand  bankruptcy  court  authorization  conditioned  on  \"adequate\r             \r\n\nprotection\" for  MHFA's security  interest, id.     363(c)(2)(B),\r                                                         \r\n\n361, 363(e).  Thus, restoration  of the converted cash collateral\r\n\nto  the chapter 11 estate would have represented neither an empty\r\n\njudicial exercise,  nor a windfall  or \"super priority\"  to MHFA,\r\n\nbut  appropriate  recognition  of  the  valuable  legal advantage\r\n\nenjoyed by the holder of a secured claim in a bankruptcy proceed-\r\n\ning. \r\n\n          Nevertheless,  we do  not  think  the bankruptcy  court\r\n\nruling  should  be interpreted  simply  as  a determination  that\r\n\nsecured  NHA  lenders  in  these  circumstances  neither  sustain\r\n\ncognizable  injury nor  have  any recourse  for recovering  their\r\n\ncollateral, but  rather as a determination  that MHFA prematurely\r                                                                           \r\n\nsought extraordinary injunctive relief against the wrong party   \r                                                                        \r\n\nthe  chapter 11  debtor     without  first attempting  to exhaust\r\n\nother available remedies against nondebtors.  \r\n\n     2.  \"Irreparability\" of Injury; Adequacy of Remedy at Law\r               2.  \"Irreparability\" of Injury; Adequacy of Remedy at Law\r                                                                        \r\n\n          Every  court  which  has  considered the  question  has\r\n\ndetermined that the NHA  empowers HUD to enforce  its prepetition\r\n\nrights under  a Regulatory Agreement  notwithstanding the initia-\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\ntion of a  chapter 11 proceeding by or  against the NHA borrower.\r\n\nSee, e.g., In re  EES Lambert Assocs., 43  B.R. 689, 691  (Bankr.\r                                               \r\n\nN.D.

See Conille  v. Secretary of Hous. and  Urban Dev., 840\r                                                                      \r\nF.2d 105, 110  n.6 (1st Cir. 1988).  This  principle is of little\r\nutility  in the instant case, however, for two principal reasons.\r\nFirst, there is no apparent interstice in the NHA, which express-\r\nly prescribes severe criminal penalties for violating HUD Regula-\r\ntory  Agreements, see 12  U.S.C.    1715z(19) ($250,000  fine, 5-\r                               \r\nyears' imprisonment), thereby  providing a powerful  deterrent to\r\nunauthorized prepetition diversions of HUD collateral by debtors.\r\nSecond,  the \"reimbursement\"  remedy requested  by MHFA  not only\r\nnecessitates  a  judicial assessment  of NHA  policy, but  of any\r\nconflicting Bankruptcy Code policy.  We do not regard this  as an\r\nappropriate invitation to engage in judicial lawmaking, except as\r\na last resort. \r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n     1.

Even if  the $35,000\r                                  \r\n\nretainer  is  not property  of the  chapter  7 estate,  hence not\r\n\nsubject  to  chapter  7  administration, MHFA  has  suggested  no\r\n\nplausible basis for concluding  that it cannot trace  and recover\r\n\nthe  diverted  collateral  in  a  nonbankruptcy  lawsuit directed\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nagainst the  debtor's chapter 11 counsel (which  is not protected\r\n\nby  the automatic stay, see  Bankruptcy Code    362) to foreclose\r                                     \r\n\nupon  its prior  lien on the  rents.   On the other  hand, if the\r                               \r\n\nretainer  remains  property of  the  chapter 7  estate,  MHFA may\r\n\npursue  its  bankruptcy  court  remedies  against  the  nondebtor\r                                                                           \r\n\nchapter 11 counsel.\r\n\n     3.

Consequently, the  debtor retained  no\r                    \r\n\nlegal or equitable  \"interest\" in these monies as  of the date of\r\n\nthe  chapter 11 petition; and no right  to, or interest in, these\r\n\nmonies  ever became  property  of the  chapter  11 estate.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBankruptcy  Code   541(a)(6).  MHFA could point to no conceivable\r\n\nbasis upon which  the bankruptcy  court, at this  point in  time,\r\n\ncould  direct Coopers  &amp;  Lybrand to  turn over  any part  of its\r\n\n$25,000 retainer  to the  chapter 7  estate.

Moreover, MHFA  has suggested\r\n\nno other basis upon  which either the debtor in possession or the\r\n\nchapter 7 trustee could have avoided  the prepetition transfer to\r\n\nCoopers  &amp; Lybrand.

The Regulatory Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, MHFA loaned Indian Motocycle Associates Limited Partnership (\"Indian Motocycle\") $8.6 million to develop low-income housing in Springfield, Massachusetts [hereinafter:  \"the Project\"].  Under a program authorized by the National Housing Act (\"NHA\"), 12 U.S.C. Secs. 1701, 1709, 1715k et seq.  (1994);  24 C.F.R. Sec. 250.1 (1994), the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") coinsured the non-recourse mortgage loan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In order to qualify for HUD coinsurance, Indian Motocycle signed a \"Regulatory Agreement,\" obligating it to comply with pertinent HUD regulations and conditions whereby the individual Indian Motocycle partners assumed personal liability \"for funds or property of the Project which come into their hands and which they are not entitled to retain;  and ... for their own acts and deeds or acts and deeds of their authorized agents that are in violation of the provisions of this Agreement.\"   The Regulatory Agreement is incorporated into the mortgage by express reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to conveying a first mortgage on all real property belonging to the Project, Indian Motocycle assigned all its Project leases, rents, profits and income to MHFA \"for the purpose of discharging the [note].\"  See Mortgage p 4;  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1715k(d)(2)(A).  MHFA in turn authorized Indian Motocycle to collect and apply Project rents to enumerated purposes, including loan repayments and \"reasonable expenses necessary to the operation and maintenance of the Project.\"   Regulatory Agreement p 3(b).  Indian Motocycle's right to collect Project rents terminated upon default.  See Mortgage p 4.  In the event the debtor were to breach the Regulatory Agreement, MHFA or HUD would be entitled to seek specific performance, injunctive relief, or the appointment of a receiver for the Project.  See Regulatory Agreement pp 17-18.  The mortgage and Regulatory Agreement were duly recorded by MHFA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, Indian Motocycle transferred its ownership interest in the Project to Indian Motocycle Associates III Limited Partnership, which assumed the MHFA note and mortgage;  in August 1992, it defaulted.  MHFA promptly tendered notice of default but took no immediate steps to acquire possession of the Project (as by foreclosure) or the rents (as by appointment of a receiver).  Meanwhile, Indian Motocycle Associates III Limited Partnership had withdrawn $65,000 from the rents on deposit in the Project operating accounts, with which, inter alia, it retained counsel in contemplation of the commencement of a voluntary chapter 11 proceeding ($35,000 retainer) and an accountant (Coopers &amp; Lybrand) to prepare a prepetition audit of the Project ($20,000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On December 15, 1992, following these disbursements, Indian Motocycle Associates III Limited Partnership (hereinafter:  \"debtor\") filed its chapter 11 petition and continued to operate the Project as a debtor in possession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Pursuant to the Regulatory Agreement, MHFA filed a motion to compel the debtor \"to restore [the $65,000 in cash collateral] improperly diverted from the [chapter 11] estate in violation of Title II of the [NHA].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Bankruptcy Court Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court ruled that the unauthorized prepetition transfer of MHFA cash collateral to retain chapter 11 counsel violated the Regulatory Agreement.  In re Indian Motocycle Assocs.  III Ltd. Partnership, 161 B.R. 865, 867-68 (Bankr.D.Mass.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The court nonetheless denied the motion to compel the debtor to restore the $65,000 to MHFA, noting that Regulatory Agreement violations by the debtor were \"irrelevant,\" given that the motion to compel purported to assert MHFA's legal rights against the debtor only and that no adversary proceeding had yet been commenced against the debtor's general partners, attorneys or accountants, the transferees in possession.  Id. at 868.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the bankruptcy court proceedings, MHFA had relied on case law to the effect that a debtor's unauthorized prepetition disbursement of rents securing an NHA-insured loan warrants postpetition relief compelling the debtor and/or its attorneys to restore the encumbered funds to the debtor estate.  Id.  The bankruptcy court reasoned, however, that the requested relief would undermine the Bankruptcy Code distribution scheme by entitling $65,000 of the HUD/MHFA unsecured claim against the chapter 11 estate to \"super priority\" status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On intermediate appeal, the district court reversed and remanded to the bankruptcy court for entry of an order compelling the \"[d]ebtor to restore the distributions diverted from the estate.\"  Massachusetts Hous.

Sec. 105(a) (empowering the court to \"issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor contends that the bankruptcy court correctly determined that it lacked authority under Bankruptcy Code Sec. 105(a) to order a chapter 11 debtor--even one who concedes that it improperly diverted a secured creditor's collateral shortly before filing its chapter 11 petition--to return the collateral (or its monetary equivalent) to the chapter 11 estate.  The debtor argues that it no longer retained a property \"interest\" in, or control over, the diverted collateral on the date it filed its chapter 11 petition and, accordingly, the collateral never became property of the chapter 11 estate amenable to administration.  See Bankruptcy Code Sec. 541(a)(1), (6), 11 U.S.C. Sec. 541(a)(1), (6) (providing that estate is comprised of \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,\" including \"rents ... from [real] property of the estate\") (emphasis added).  Further, the debtor says, its diversion of the encumbered rents did not alter the amount of MHFA's claim against the debtor estate, which remained the balance outstanding on the note at the date of the chapter 11 petition.  Finally, the debtor argues that the bankruptcy court correctly declined to follow those courts which have ordered chapter 11 debtors in possession to restore to the debtor estate diverted NHA-encumbered rents, see infra Section II.A.2, since those cases did not involve a non-federal agency like MHFA, nor did those courts cite to legislative history indicating that Congress intended that NHA policy override the debtor protection policy underlying the Bankruptcy Code, including the right to utilize monies in the debtor's possession to fund prepetition retainers of chapter 11 counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Injunctive Relief</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review challenged rulings of law by the district court de novo and contested findings of fact by the bankruptcy court for clear error.  See In re LaRoche, 969 F.2d 1299, 1301 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  A bankruptcy court's decision granting or denying injunctive relief pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Sec. 105(a) is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Western Auto Supply Co. v. Savage Arms, Inc.  (In re Savage Arms, Inc.), 43 F.3d 714, 719 n. 8 (1st Cir.1994).  \"Four principal factors govern the appropriateness of permanent injunctive relief:  (1) whether the plaintiff has prevailed on the merits;  (2) whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury absent injunctive relief;  (3) whether the harm to the plaintiff outweighs any harm threatened by the injunction;  and (4) whether the public interest will be adversely affected by the injunction.\"  Id.  The present appeal implicates only the first two factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Injury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the bankruptcy court ruled that the debtor's prepetition transfer of MHFA's cash collateral constituted a conversion, it concluded that injunctive relief was unwarranted since the amount owed MHFA by the chapter 11 estate remained the same.  To the extent this ruling suggests that MHFA sustained no cognizable injury, we disagree.  Since there is no indication that MHFA's claim was over-secured, the conversion by the debtor of the $65,000 cash collateral reduced MHFA's secured claim by that amount, leaving MHFA with an unsecured claim for $65,000.  See Bankruptcy Code Sec. 506(a), (b), 11 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a), (b);  see also id. Sec. 541(a)(6) (\"Such estate is comprised of ... [p]roceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of or from property of the estate [viz., the Project]\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The advantage to holding a secured claim to these rents in the chapter 11 proceeding is not to be underestimated.  Since the rents constituted \"cash collateral\" securing the MHFA note, id. Sec. 363(a) (\"cash collateral\" includes \"cash ... whenever acquired in which the estate and an entity other than the estate have an interest and includes ... rents....\");  cf. id. Sec. 552(b) (governing enforceability of prepetition security interest against postpetition rents), the rents could not have been expended or transferred without MHFA consent, id. Sec. 363(c)(2)(A), and bankruptcy court authorization conditioned on \"adequate protection\" for MHFA's security interest, id. Secs. 363(c)(2)(B), 361, 363(e).  Thus, restoration of the converted cash collateral to the chapter 11 estate would have represented neither an empty judicial exercise, nor a windfall or \"super priority\" to MHFA, but appropriate recognition of the valuable legal advantage enjoyed by the holder of a secured claim in a bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we do not think the bankruptcy court ruling should be interpreted simply as a determination that secured NHA lenders in these circumstances neither sustain cognizable injury nor have any recourse for recovering their collateral, but rather as a determination that MHFA prematurely sought extraordinary injunctive relief against the wrong party--the chapter 11 debtor--without first attempting to exhaust other available remedies against nondebtors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. \"Irreparability\" of Injury;  Adequacy of Remedy at Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every court which has considered the question has determined that the NHA empowers HUD to enforce its prepetition rights under a Regulatory Agreement notwithstanding the initiation of a chapter 11 proceeding by or against the NHA borrower.  See, e.g., In re EES Lambert Assocs., 43 B.R. 689, 691 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1984), aff'd, 63 B.R. 174 (N.D.Ill.1986);  In re Marion Carefree Ltd.

But for the unauthorized diversion, the rents normally would have been applied, as appropriate, toward Project maintenance.

See 12 U.S.C. Secs. 1709, 1715k, 1715v(c)(4) (listing numerous restrictions on NHA mortgagors).  Permitting partnership debtors, or their individual partners, to divert public funds with any degree of impunity threatens significant depletion of the treasury, see In re Garden Manor, 70 B.R. at 483, and ultimately undercuts public confidence in the efficacy of federal housing, lending, and insurance programs, thereby subverting Congress's announced intention to promote private construction of low-income housing.

Sec. 105(a), or some clear indication in the NHA that Congress envisioned such an accommodation between the NHA and the Bankruptcy Code.  Thus, we think it is not enough simply to point to the importance of safeguarding the integrity of the NHA loan program, where neither the NHA, the Regulatory Agreement entered into pursuant to the NHA, nor the Bankruptcy Code itself so much as intimates that a bankruptcy court may fashion the extraordinary \"reimbursement\" relief sought by MHFA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No matter how compelling the public policy reasons for formulating such extraordinary relief, it must be recognized that the right and remedy are judge-made.   Bankruptcy courts must be especially cautious about embarking upon a lawmaking exercise in circumstances where the injured party has neither demonstrated that it has exhausted, nor even pursued, efficacious alternative forms of relief which, if available, might well preclude a finding that the relief sought from the bankruptcy court is either \"necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of [the Bankruptcy Code].\"  Bankruptcy Code Sec. 105(a), 11 U.S.C. Sec. 105(a).  See generally Lopez v. Garriga, 917 F.2d 63, 68 (1st Cir.1990) (noting that injunction-seeker must first show that he has \"no adequate remedy at law\");  see also Baker v.

And once its unperfected lien was voided under Bankruptcy Code Sec. 544(a), MHFA would have had no right to control the disposition of any portion of the $65,000 in cash collateral which remained property of the chapter 7 estate, cf.

MHFA cites several so-called \"collateral reimbursement\" decisions, see supra Section II.A.2, in which debtor counsel have been directed to surrender to the bankruptcy estate monies diverted to fund prepetition retainers.  See, e.g., In re Westwood Plaza Apartments, 154 B.R. at 923 n. 11.

See, e.g., In re McDonald Bros. Constr., Inc., 114 B.R. 989, 1002 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1990) (type of retainer is question of fact);  see also In re DLIC, Inc., 120 B.R. 348, 351 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1990) (type of retainer depends on intent of parties).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Certain retainers simply ensure counsel's availability to represent the client (whether or not any legal services are ever performed), or constitute prepayment for all future legal services to be performed (e.g., a flat fee).  In these circumstances, counsel acquires full title to the retainer fee on the date of payment, regardless whether legal services are ever performed.  See In re McDonald, 114 B.R. at 997-98, 999-1000;  see also In re Mondie Forge Co., 154 B.R. 232, 235 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 1993).  Such a retainer is precisely the same as the retainer fee paid Coopers &amp; Lybrand;  it never became part of the property of the debtor estate, and is subject to turnover only if it \"exceeds the reasonable value of services rendered.\"   See Bankruptcy Code Sec. 329(b);  In re McDonald, 114 B.R. at 995-96, 1003 n. 18;  cf. also Bankruptcy Code Sec. 548(a)(2), 11 U.S.C.

Under the ethical rules applicable in most jurisdictions, these monies remain property of the client until applied by counsel in payment of legal services actually performed.  See In re McDonald, 114 B.R. at 999;  see also In re Saturley, 131 B.R. 509, 515 (Bankr.D.Me.1991);  In re Lilliston, 127 B.R. 119, 120 (Bankr.D.Md.1991) (portion of prepetition retainer not earned prior to petition is property of estate);  In re Fitzsimmons Trucking, Inc., 124 B.R. 556, 558-59 (Bankr.D.Minn.1991) (same).  In the instant case, the debtor's equitable \"interest\" in any unearned portion of the retainer, impressed with MHFA's perfected lien, would have become property of the estate on the date the chapter 11 petition was filed, see Bankruptcy Code Sec. 541(a)(6), and presumably would remain subject to a turnover order in a section 542 action brought by the debtor in possession.  See In re McDonald, 114 B.R. at 1000 n. 13 (citing In re Gerwer, 898 F.2d 730, 734 (9th Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if the $35,000 transfer constituted a \"security\" retainer, counsel would be required to file a section 330 fee application to withdraw the retainer.

MHFA could then object to debtor counsel's retention of any portion of the retainer not yet devoted to legal services which were \"actual [and] necessary,\" see Bankruptcy Code Sec. 330, and the bankruptcy court presumably could order debtor counsel to surrender the unearned portion as \"property of the estate.\"   See id.

Rather, it was MHFA's burden to demonstrate the unavailability of any alternative remedy for recovering its collateral.  See supra Section II.A.2.  Even if the $35,000 retainer is not property of the chapter 7 estate, hence not subject to chapter 7 administration, MHFA has suggested no plausible basis for concluding that it cannot trace and recover the diverted collateral in a nonbankruptcy lawsuit directed against the debtor's chapter 11 counsel (which is not protected by the automatic stay, see Bankruptcy Code Sec. 362) to foreclose upon its prior lien on the rents.  On the other hand, if the retainer remains property of the chapter 7 estate, MHFA may pursue its bankruptcy court remedies against the nondebtor chapter 11 counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Accounting Firm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, MHFA conceded that the debtor made its $25,000 prepetition payment to Coopers &amp; Lybrand for audit services which were completed prior to the chapter 11 petition.  See supra Section I.A.  Consequently, the debtor retained no legal or equitable \"interest\" in these monies as of the date of the chapter 11 petition;  and no right to, or interest in, these monies ever became property of the chapter 11 estate.  See Bankruptcy Code Sec. 541(a)(6).  MHFA could point to no conceivable basis upon which the bankruptcy court, at this point in time, could direct Coopers &amp; Lybrand to turn over any part of its $25,000 retainer to the chapter 7 estate.  See id. Sec. 542, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 542 (third party, in possession of property of estate, may be compelled to turn it over to trustee); United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U.S. 198, 103 S.Ct. 2309, 76 L.Ed.2d 515 (1983) (even a secured party in possession of collateral constituting \"property of the estate\" is subject to Sec. 542 turnover order).  Moreover, MHFA has suggested no other basis upon which either the debtor in possession or the chapter 7 trustee could have avoided the prepetition transfer to Coopers &amp; Lybrand.  See, e.g., id. Secs. 544 (avoidance of unperfected liens), 545 (avoidance of statutory liens), 547 (avoidance of preferences), 548 (avoidance of fraudulent transfers).

The automatic stay afforded no protection to Coopers &amp; Lybrand, see Bankruptcy Code Sec. 362, and MHFA may seek to execute its perfected lien directly.

See Conille v. Secretary of Hous. and Urban Dev., 840 F.2d 105, 110 n. 6 (1st Cir.1988).  This principle is of little utility in the instant case, however, for two principal reasons.  First, there is no apparent interstice in the NHA, which expressly prescribes severe criminal penalties for violating HUD Regulatory Agreements, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1715z-19 ($250,000 fine, 5-years' imprisonment), thereby providing a powerful deterrent to unauthorized prepetition diversions of HUD collateral by debtors.  Second, the \"reimbursement\" remedy requested by MHFA not only necessitates a judicial assessment of NHA policy, but of any conflicting Bankruptcy Code policy.

We assume arguendo that the chapter 7 trustee would attempt to avoid MHFA's lien in order that the net proceeds could be applied to claims against the estate, including any MHFA claim.

In all events, given our determination, infra, that MHFA's security interest was perfected under both federal and Massachusetts law, the distinction is inconsequential.

There is no basis for relief from waiver in the instant case.  Even in its reply brief, the debtor chose not to discuss the implications of Kimbell or Butner on the choice-of-law question;  instead simply stating its conclusion that Massachusetts law should be applied.

Thus, parties with security interests in future rents generated from encumbered real property need not comply with the Uniform Commercial Code.

Under a program authorized by the National Housing Act (\"NHA\"), 12 U.S.C. Secs. 1701, 1709, 1715k et seq.  (1994);  24 C.F.R. Sec. 250.1 (1994), the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") coinsured the non-recourse mortgage loan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In order to qualify for HUD coinsurance, Indian Motocycle signed a \"Regulatory Agreement,\" obligating it to comply with pertinent HUD regulations and conditions whereby the individual Indian Motocycle partners assumed personal liability \"for funds or property of the Project which come into their hands and which they are not entitled to retain;  and ... for their own acts and deeds or acts and deeds of their authorized agents that are in violation of the provisions of this Agreement.\"   The Regulatory Agreement is incorporated into the mortgage by express reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to conveying a first mortgage on all real property belonging to the Project, Indian Motocycle assigned all its Project leases, rents, profits and income to MHFA \"for the purpose of discharging the [note].\"  See Mortgage p 4;  12 U.S.C. Sec. 1715k(d)(2)(A).  MHFA in turn authorized Indian Motocycle to collect and apply Project rents to enumerated purposes, including loan repayments and \"reasonable expenses necessary to the operation and maintenance of the Project.\"   Regulatory Agreement p 3(b).  Indian Motocycle's right to collect Project rents terminated upon default.  See Mortgage p 4.  In the event the debtor were to breach the Regulatory Agreement, MHFA or HUD would be entitled to seek specific performance, injunctive relief, or the appointment of a receiver for the Project.  See Regulatory Agreement pp 17-18.  The mortgage and Regulatory Agreement were duly recorded by MHFA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, Indian Motocycle transferred its ownership interest in the Project to Indian Motocycle Associates III Limited Partnership, which assumed the MHFA note and mortgage;  in August 1992, it defaulted.  MHFA promptly tendered notice of default but took no immediate steps to acquire possession of the Project (as by foreclosure) or the rents (as by appointment of a receiver).  Meanwhile, Indian Motocycle Associates III Limited Partnership had withdrawn $65,000 from the rents on deposit in the Project operating accounts, with which, inter alia, it retained counsel in contemplation of the commencement of a voluntary chapter 11 proceeding ($35,000 retainer) and an accountant (Coopers &amp; Lybrand) to prepare a prepetition audit of the Project ($20,000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On December 15, 1992, following these disbursements, Indian Motocycle Associates III Limited Partnership (hereinafter:  \"debtor\") filed its chapter 11 petition and continued to operate the Project as a debtor in possession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Pursuant to the Regulatory Agreement, MHFA filed a motion to compel the debtor \"to restore [the $65,000 in cash collateral] improperly diverted from the [chapter 11] estate in violation of Title II of the [NHA].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

The debtor argues that it no longer retained a property \"interest\" in, or control over, the diverted collateral on the date it filed its chapter 11 petition and, accordingly, the collateral never became property of the chapter 11 estate amenable to administration.  See Bankruptcy Code Sec. 541(a)(1), (6), 11 U.S.C. Sec. 541(a)(1), (6) (providing that estate is comprised of \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,\" including \"rents ... from [real] property of the estate\") (emphasis added).  Further, the debtor says, its diversion of the encumbered rents did not alter the amount of MHFA's claim against the debtor estate, which remained the balance outstanding on the note at the date of the chapter 11 petition.  Finally, the debtor argues that the bankruptcy court correctly declined to follow those courts which have ordered chapter 11 debtors in possession to restore to the debtor estate diverted NHA-encumbered rents, see infra Section II.A.2, since those cases did not involve a non-federal agency like MHFA, nor did those courts cite to legislative history indicating that Congress intended that NHA policy override the debtor protection policy underlying the Bankruptcy Code, including the right to utilize monies in the debtor's possession to fund prepetition retainers of chapter 11 counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

Since there is no indication that MHFA's claim was over-secured, the conversion by the debtor of the $65,000 cash collateral reduced MHFA's secured claim by that amount, leaving MHFA with an unsecured claim for $65,000.

Sec. 105(a), or some clear indication in the NHA that Congress envisioned such an accommodation between the NHA and the Bankruptcy Code.  Thus, we think it is not enough simply to point to the importance of safeguarding the integrity of the NHA loan program, where neither the NHA, the Regulatory Agreement entered into pursuant to the NHA, nor the Bankruptcy Code itself so much as intimates that a bankruptcy court may fashion the extraordinary \"reimbursement\" relief sought by MHFA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No matter how compelling the public policy reasons for formulating such extraordinary relief, it must be recognized that the right and remedy are judge-made.   Bankruptcy courts must be especially cautious about embarking upon a lawmaking exercise in circumstances where the injured party has neither demonstrated that it has exhausted, nor even pursued, efficacious alternative forms of relief which, if available, might well preclude a finding that the relief sought from the bankruptcy court is either \"necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of [the Bankruptcy Code].\"  Bankruptcy Code Sec. 105(a), 11 U.S.C.

This principle is of little utility in the instant case, however, for two principal reasons.  First, there is no apparent interstice in the NHA, which expressly prescribes severe criminal penalties for violating HUD Regulatory Agreements, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1715z-19 ($250,000 fine, 5-years' imprisonment), thereby providing a powerful deterrent to unauthorized prepetition diversions of HUD collateral by debtors.  Second, the \"reimbursement\" remedy requested by MHFA not only necessitates a judicial assessment of NHA policy, but of any conflicting Bankruptcy Code policy.  We do not regard this as an appropriate invitation to engage in judicial lawmaking, except as a last resort</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Following appointment of the chapter 7 trustee, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span>note 3, all avoidance powers resided exclusively in the trustee, not in the debtor.

Under the NHA coinsurance regime, MHFA will assign the note to HUD in return for payment of any unrecovered deficiency.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1710;  see also supra note 1.  In all events, given our determination, infra, that MHFA's security interest was perfected under both federal and Massachusetts law, the distinction is inconsequential.

Issues presented for the first time in a reply brief normally are deemed waived.  See Clarke v.

There is no basis for relief from waiver in the instant case.  Even in its reply brief, the debtor chose not to discuss the implications of Kimbell or Butner on the choice-of-law question;  instead simply stating its conclusion that Massachusetts law should be applied.  See Williams v. Poulos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195087\"><a href=\"/opinion/195087/williams-v-poulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 285 (1st Cir.1993) (issues adverted to in perfunctory manner, without adequate argumentation, deemed waived)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Although MHFA concedes that it did not file a financing statement, the law in most states, including Massachusetts, classifies an assignment of rents as an interest in real property.
