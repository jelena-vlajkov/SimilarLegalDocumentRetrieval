On February\n\n2, 1993, Winthrop  filed a petition for  relief under Chapter\n\n11 of the  Bankruptcy Code (the  \"Code\").  On July  16, 1993,\n\nWinthrop   filed  its  Disclosure   Statement  and   Plan  of\n\nReorganization (the \"Plan\").  The Plan provides that Winthrop\n\nwill  retain all of its assets except for the Property, which\n\nis to be transferred to a new entity apparently controlled by\n\nWinthrop's principal,  which will  in turn lease  it back  to\n\nWinthrop.  Thus, under the Plan, Winthrop effectively retains\n\ncontrol of the Property and its use.\n\n          The Property  is encumbered by a  first mortgage in\n\nthe  amount of $287,000 held by  Northeast Savings, F.A., and\n\nby tax liens of approximately $20,000.  NBIS, the holder of a\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\njunior  mortgage  on  the  Property,  is  owed  approximately\n\n$576,000.   The parties stipulated to a liquidation value for\n\nthe Property of $300,000 and a fair market value of $400,000.\n\nWinthrop's Plan would transfer the Property to the new entity\n\nfree  and clear of all liens except for the Northeast Savings\n\nmortgage.  The Plan  would \"strip down\" the NBIS  mortgage to\n\nthe liquidation  value of the Property,  leaving NBIS's claim\n\nentirely  unsecured.  The  Plan proposes  a payout  of twenty\n\ncents on  the dollar  over a  four-year  period to  unsecured\n\ncreditors,    whose    claims,   including    NBIS's,   total\n\napproximately $756,761.\n\n          NBIS  objected  to  the  Plan,  claiming  that  the\n\nProperty  should   be  valued  at  fair   market  value,  not\n\nliquidation  value.  If the Property is valued at fair market\n\nvalue,  NBIS  would have  a secured  claim  in the  amount of\n\napproximately  $100,000,  with  the  remainder  of its  claim\n\nunsecured.\n\n          The  bankruptcy  court,  citing  a  line  of  cases\n\nholding  that  fair  market or  going  concern  value is  the\n\nappropriate standard in valuing  collateral that a Chapter 11\n\ndebtor proposes to retain and  use, granted NBIS's motion and\n\nvalued  the  Property  at   $400,000.    The  district  court\n\naffirmed, and Winthrop now appeals.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          \"In  an  appeal from  district  court  review of  a\n\nbankruptcy  court   order,   we  independently   review   the\n\nbankruptcy court's decision, applying the `clearly erroneous'\n\nstandard  to   findings  of  fact  and  de   novo  review  to\n\nconclusions of law.\"  Grella v.

The  statute does not\n\ndirect courts to choose  any particular valuation standard in\n\na  given  type  of case.    As  evidenced  by the  emphasized\n\nlanguage   in  the   statute's   second  sentence,   Congress\n\napparently did  not intend  that  courts would  use either  a\r                               \n\nliquidation  or  fair  market  value   standard  exclusively,\n\nenvisioning instead a flexible approach by which courts would\n\nchoose  a  standard  to  fit  the  circumstances.    Relevant\n\nlegislative history buttresses this notion.  The House Report\n\nstates:\n\n          Subsection  (a) of  [  506]  separates an\n          undersecured  creditor's  claim into  two\n          parts-he  has  a  secured  claim  to  the\n          extent of the value of his collateral; he\r                                                           \n          has an undersecured claim for the balance\n          of  his   claim.     \"Value\"   does   not\r                                                               \n          necessarily  contemplate  forced sale  or\r                                                               \n          liquidation value of the  collateral; nor\r                                                               \n          does it imply a full going concern value.\r                                                               \n          Courts will  have to determine value on a\r                                                               \n          case-by-case  basis, taking  into account\r                                                               \n          the facts of each  case and the competing\r                                                               \n          interests in the case.\r                                           \n\nH.R.

Although this\n\ncommentary is not specifically  addressed to   506(a), it  is\n\nnevertheless relevant,  since a valuation for    361 purposes\n\nnecessarily  looks to    506(a)  for  a determination  of the\n\namount  of   a  secured  claim.1     Indeed,  since  adequate\n\nprotection payments immediately deplete the estate's assets -\n\n- even before it  is certain that a reorganization  plan will\n\nbe confirmed -- one would expect that the  valuation standard\n\nused to determine whether  such payments are justified should\n\nbe extremely conservative.

This interpretation gives\n\nmeaning to both sentences of   506(a), and enables bankruptcy\n\ncourts  to exercise  the flexibility  Congress intended.   By\n\nretaining collateral,  a Chapter  11 debtor is  ensuring that\n\nthe very event Winthrop proposes to use to value the property\n\n-- a  foreclosure sale -- will  not take place.   At the same\n\ntime,  the debtor  should  not be  heard  to argue  that,  in\n\nvaluing the  collateral, the court should  disregard the very\n\nevent that, according to the debtor's plan, will take place -\r                                                            \n\n- namely, the debtor's  use of the collateral to  generate an\n\nincome stream.   In ordinary circumstances  the present value\n\nof  the income stream would be equal to the collateral's fair\n\nmarket  value.   Under  such circumstances,  a court  remains\n\nfaithful  to  the  dictates  of     506(a)   by  valuing  the\n\ncreditor's  interest  in  the  collateral  in  light  of  the\n\nproposed post-bankruptcy  reality:   no foreclosure sale  and\n\neconomic benefit  for the debtor derived  from the collateral\n\nequal to or greater than its fair market value.  Our approach\n\nallows the bankruptcy  court, using  its informed  discretion\n\nand applying historic principles of  equity, to adopt in each\n\ncase  the   valuation  method  that  is   fairest  given  the\n\nprevailing circumstances.\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          The interpretation championed by the second line of\n\ncases  renders  the second  sentence  of    506(a)  virtually\n\nmeaningless.  Moreover, it  would allow a reorganizing debtor\n\nto  reap a windfall by stripping down the lien to liquidation\n\nvalue  and  quickly selling  the  collateral  at fair  market\n\nvalue, thus pocketing equity  that would have been completely\n\nbeyond reach save  for the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\n\nCf.  Butner  v.  United  States,  440  U.S.   48,  55  (1979)\r                                           \n\n(bankruptcy  law should  \"prevent  a party  from receiving  a\n\nwindfall merely by reason of the happenstance of bankruptcy\")\n\n(quotation  omitted).  It is true that the debtor's intention\n\nto reorganize under  Chapter 11 is what  gives the collateral\n\nits going-concern value.   And  while it is  also true  that,\n\nabsent a reorganization plan,  the creditor might not recover\n\nthe difference -- assuming that there is in fact a difference\n\n-- between the  collateral's fair market value and the amount\n\nrecoverable  through  its  state  law rights,  we  would  not\n\ncharacterize this additional recovery  as a \"windfall\" to the\n\ncreditor,  and  certainly  not  one that  will  spur  secured\n\ncreditors  to eschew their state law remedies and seek refuge\n\nin the comfortable confines of the bankruptcy courts.\n\n           We   find  that  the  bankruptcy  court  correctly\n\ninterpreted   506(a) as  according it flexibility in choosing\n\namong possible  standards of valuation,  and properly applied\n\nthe statute to the  particular facts of this case.

On February\n\n2, 1993, Winthrop  filed a petition for  relief under Chapter\n\n11 of the  Bankruptcy Code (the  \"Code\").  On July  16, 1993,\n\nWinthrop   filed  its  Disclosure   Statement  and   Plan  of\n\nReorganization (the \"Plan\").  The Plan provides that Winthrop\n\nwill  retain all of its assets except for the Property, which\n\nis to be transferred to a new entity apparently controlled by\n\nWinthrop's principal,  which will  in turn lease  it back  to\n\nWinthrop.  Thus, under the Plan, Winthrop effectively retains\n\ncontrol of the Property and its use.\n\n          The Property  is encumbered by a  first mortgage in\n\nthe  amount of $287,000 held by  Northeast Savings, F.A., and\n\nby tax liens of approximately $20,000.  NBIS, the holder of a\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\njunior  mortgage  on  the  Property,  is  owed  approximately\n\n$576,000.   The parties stipulated to a liquidation value for\n\nthe Property of $300,000 and a fair market value of $400,000.\n\nWinthrop's Plan would transfer the Property to the new entity\n\nfree  and clear of all liens except for the Northeast Savings\n\nmortgage.  The Plan  would \"strip down\" the NBIS  mortgage to\n\nthe liquidation  value of the Property,  leaving NBIS's claim\n\nentirely  unsecured.  The  Plan proposes  a payout  of twenty\n\ncents on  the dollar  over a  four-year  period to  unsecured\n\ncreditors,    whose    claims,   including    NBIS's,   total\n\napproximately $756,761.\n\n          NBIS  objected  to  the  Plan,  claiming  that  the\n\nProperty  should   be  valued  at  fair   market  value,  not\n\nliquidation  value.  If the Property is valued at fair market\n\nvalue,  NBIS  would have  a secured  claim  in the  amount of\n\napproximately  $100,000,  with  the  remainder  of its  claim\n\nunsecured.\n\n          The  bankruptcy  court,  citing  a  line  of  cases\n\nholding  that  fair  market or  going  concern  value is  the\n\nappropriate standard in valuing  collateral that a Chapter 11\n\ndebtor proposes to retain and  use, granted NBIS's motion and\n\nvalued  the  Property  at   $400,000.    The  district  court\n\naffirmed, and Winthrop now appeals.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          \"In  an  appeal from  district  court  review of  a\n\nbankruptcy  court   order,   we  independently   review   the\n\nbankruptcy court's decision, applying the `clearly erroneous'\n\nstandard  to   findings  of  fact  and  de   novo  review  to\n\nconclusions of law.\"  Grella v.

The  statute does not\n\ndirect courts to choose  any particular valuation standard in\n\na  given  type  of case.    As  evidenced  by the  emphasized\n\nlanguage   in  the   statute's   second  sentence,   Congress\n\napparently did  not intend  that  courts would  use either  a\r                               \n\nliquidation  or  fair  market  value   standard  exclusively,\n\nenvisioning instead a flexible approach by which courts would\n\nchoose  a  standard  to  fit  the  circumstances.    Relevant\n\nlegislative history buttresses this notion.

Although this\n\ncommentary is not specifically  addressed to   506(a), it  is\n\nnevertheless relevant,  since a valuation for    361 purposes\n\nnecessarily  looks to    506(a)  for  a determination  of the\n\namount  of   a  secured  claim.1     Indeed,  since  adequate\n\nprotection payments immediately deplete the estate's assets -\n\n- even before it  is certain that a reorganization  plan will\n\nbe confirmed -- one would expect that the  valuation standard\n\nused to determine whether  such payments are justified should\n\nbe extremely conservative.

This interpretation gives\n\nmeaning to both sentences of   506(a), and enables bankruptcy\n\ncourts  to exercise  the flexibility  Congress intended.   By\n\nretaining collateral,  a Chapter  11 debtor is  ensuring that\n\nthe very event Winthrop proposes to use to value the property\n\n-- a  foreclosure sale -- will  not take place.   At the same\n\ntime,  the debtor  should  not be  heard  to argue  that,  in\n\nvaluing the  collateral, the court should  disregard the very\n\nevent that, according to the debtor's plan, will take place -\r                                                            \n\n- namely, the debtor's  use of the collateral to  generate an\n\nincome stream.   In ordinary circumstances  the present value\n\nof  the income stream would be equal to the collateral's fair\n\nmarket  value.   Under  such circumstances,  a court  remains\n\nfaithful  to  the  dictates  of     506(a)   by  valuing  the\n\ncreditor's  interest  in  the  collateral  in  light  of  the\n\nproposed post-bankruptcy  reality:   no foreclosure sale  and\n\neconomic benefit  for the debtor derived  from the collateral\n\nequal to or greater than its fair market value.  Our approach\n\nallows the bankruptcy  court, using  its informed  discretion\n\nand applying historic principles of  equity, to adopt in each\n\ncase  the   valuation  method  that  is   fairest  given  the\n\nprevailing circumstances.\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          The interpretation championed by the second line of\n\ncases  renders  the second  sentence  of    506(a)  virtually\n\nmeaningless.  Moreover, it  would allow a reorganizing debtor\n\nto  reap a windfall by stripping down the lien to liquidation\n\nvalue  and  quickly selling  the  collateral  at fair  market\n\nvalue, thus pocketing equity  that would have been completely\n\nbeyond reach save  for the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\n\nCf.

It is true that the debtor's intention\n\nto reorganize under  Chapter 11 is what  gives the collateral\n\nits going-concern value.   And  while it is  also true  that,\n\nabsent a reorganization plan,  the creditor might not recover\n\nthe difference -- assuming that there is in fact a difference\n\n-- between the  collateral's fair market value and the amount\n\nrecoverable  through  its  state  law rights,  we  would  not\n\ncharacterize this additional recovery  as a \"windfall\" to the\n\ncreditor,  and  certainly  not  one that  will  spur  secured\n\ncreditors  to eschew their state law remedies and seek refuge\n\nin the comfortable confines of the bankruptcy courts.\n\n           We   find  that  the  bankruptcy  court  correctly\n\ninterpreted   506(a) as  according it flexibility in choosing\n\namong possible  standards of valuation,  and properly applied\n\nthe statute to the  particular facts of this case.
