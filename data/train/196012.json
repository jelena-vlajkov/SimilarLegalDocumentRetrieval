His\n\nsuit under 42 U.S.C.   1983 -- against the prison entity, its\n\nwarden and deputy warden, a medical administrator, a John Doe\n\nnurse,  and the entire medical staff at the prison -- alleged\n\nvarious instances  of failure  to provide  medical treatment.\n\nSpecifically, Sirois claimed  that the defendants refused  to\n\ntreat  an   abscess  that  resulted  from   an  injection  of\n\nmedication  administered on  March  2, 1994.   The  complaint\n\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary\n\ndamages.  The magistrate-judge recommended that the complaint\n\nbe dismissed as frivolous.  Sirois objected, but the district\n\ncourt  adopted the  recommended  decision  and dismissed  the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n          Although  the  district  court  may  have erred  in\n\ndismissing the  complaint as frivolous under    1915(d) since\n\nSirois'  claims  are  at   least  arguable,  see  Neitzke  v.\r                                                                     \n\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319,  327-28 (1989), we nonetheless affirm\r                    \n\non  the basis that  the error was  harmless.

The  condition\r                     \n\nsuffered  as a result of  the injection appears  to have been\n\nrelatively minor.   There  are no  allegations of fever,  and\n\nSirois  was vague about the severity and duration of pain, as\n\nwell  as  the  number of  treatment  requests  made.   It  is\n\nacknowledged that the condition  was treated after the filing\n\nof this  complaint, seemingly to Sirois'  satisfaction.  Even\n\ntreating  his  objections  to  the  magistrate's  recommended\n\ndecision as  amendments, we are persuaded  that the complaint\n\nfailed to state a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim.\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed.\r                              \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n                UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n\n                    FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                           \n\nNo. 94-2172\n\n                    CMM CABLE REP., INC.,\n\n            d/b/a CREATIVE MEDIA MANAGEMENT, INC.,\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n                OCEAN COAST PROPERTIES, INC.,\n\n                    d/b/a WPOR-FM, ET AL.,\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\n\n                                           \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n         [Hon.

CMM   claims  to  have   created  a\n\npromotional contest called \"PAYROLL PAYOFF .\"  In due season,\n\nit  trademarked the  name and  copyrighted various  materials\n\ndesigned  for  use in  executing  promotional  campaigns that\n\nfeatured  the contest.  The  mechanics of PAYROLL PAYOFF  are\n\nnot relevant to the mootness issue, and rehearsing them would\n\nserve no useful purpose.2\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  In point of fact,  the district court did not  deny CMM's\nmotion  for preliminary  injunction outright,  but granted  a\nsmall measure of relief.   On appeal, CMM complains  that the\ncourt  gave it considerably  less than  its due,  drawing the\ninjunction in much too crabbed a fashion.\n\n2.  We refer  readers who thirst  for greater knowledge  to a\nmore   detailed  account  of   the  PAYROLL  PAYOFF   concept\ncontained   in   CMM   Cable    Rep.,   Inc.   v.   Keymarket\r                                                                         \nCommunications,  Inc., 870  F.  Supp. 631,  633-34 (M.D.  Pa.\r                                 \n1994).\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          CMM  unsuccessfully  pitched  the  PAYROLL  PAYOFF \n\npromotion  to radio station  WMGX, its regular  client in the\n\nPortland, Maine, market.  Subsequently, a competing  station,\n\nWPOR,3 tried to  acquire the right  to run the contest.   CMM\n\nrefused to  deal out  of loyalty  to WMGX.    WPOR then  took\n\nmatters into its  own hands and \"created\"  (or so it says)  a\n\ncontest-type  promotion,  reminiscent  in  some  respects  of\n\nPAYROLL PAYOFF , called  \"PAYDAY.\"   WPOR began  broadcasting\n\nits PAYDAY contest in the fall of 1994.\n\n                              II\r                                          II\n\n          Unconsoled by  the bromide  that  imitation is  the\n\nsincerest form of  flattery, CMM brought suit  in the federal\n\ndistrict   court  charging,  among  other  things,  copyright\n\ninfringement, trademark infringement, and unfair competition.\n\nCMM's complaint prayed,  inter alia,  for damages,  equitable\r                                               \n\nremedies, and attorneys'  fees.  In  addition, CMM moved  for\n\nboth  temporary and  preliminary  injunctive relief  to  halt\n\nWPOR's use of the PAYDAY contest pendente lite.\r                                                          \n\n          The  district court  refused to  issue  a temporary\n\nrestraining order.   Instead, it held  an evidentiary hearing\n\nand,  on  November 4,  1994,  granted  a limited  preliminary\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Defendant  Ocean  Coast  Properties, Inc.  operates  WPOR\n(sometimes referred to by  plaintiff as WPOR-FM).  Defendants\nRobert Gold,  Phillip Corper, and William  Therriault are all\ninterested  in the  station's  operation.   For  simplicity's\nsake,  we refer to the defendants, collectively, as \"WPOR\" or\n\"appellees.\"\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ninjunction prohibiting further production and distribution of\n\nthe  brochures that  WPOR had  prepared  to help  promote its\n\nPAYDAY  scheme.4   The  court  refused  to enjoin  WPOR  from\n\nproceeding with the contest  proper, however, ruling that CMM\n\nhad shown scant prospects of success on its principal claims.\n\nThis appeal ensued.\n\n          While  the appellate  process  was  underway,  WPOR\n\nmoved  to  dismiss the  appeal on  grounds  of mootness.   In\n\nsupport,  it averred  that  the PAYDAY  contest  had run  its\n\ncourse, and was no  longer being broadcast.  CMM  objected to\n\nthe proposed  dismissal.   Though admitting that  the contest\n\nwas  off  the air,  CMM asserted  that  its appeal  could not\n\nfairly be characterized  as moot.   On February  9, 1995,  we\n\nheard arguments  spanning both  the question of  mootness and\n\nthe merits of the appeal.\n\n                             III\r                                         III\n\n          A   federal  appellate  court   may  only  exercise\n\njurisdiction  over actual  \"cases\" or \"controversies.\"   U.S.\n\nConst. art. III,    2,  cl. 1.   The instant appeal  provides\n\nthis court with no live controversy to resolve, and, thus, we\n\nlack appellate jurisdiction.  We explain briefly.\n\n          This  is an  interlocutory appeal.   It  is brought\n\nstrictly and solely to test whether the district court abused\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  The court  determined that CMM would  probably succeed in\nshowing that the brochures infringed existing copyrights. \n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nits  discretion  in withholding  certain  provisional relief.\n\nThe   relief  sought  is  in  the  nature  of  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction.   The purpose of  a preliminary injunction  is to\n\npreserve the status quo, freezing an existing situation so as\n\nto  permit the  trial court,  upon full  adjudication of  the\n\ncase's merits,  more effectively to remedy  discerned wrongs.\n\nSee Chalk v.  United States  Dist. Court, 840  F.2d 701,  704\r                                                    \n\n(9th  Cir. 1988); American  Hosp. Ass'n  v.

The court's interim  injunctive\n\ndecree attempts to prevent  further injury by maintaining the\n\nstatus quo,  cf. Narragansett  Indian Tribe v.  Guilbert, 934\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d  4,  5  (1st  Cir. 1991)  (listing  the  \"potential  for\n\nirreparable  injury\"  as  a  standard  prerequisite  for  the\n\ngranting  of a  preliminary injunction),  thus enhancing  the\n\ncourt's ability,  if it ultimately  finds for the  movant, to\n\nminimize the  harmful  effects of  the  defendant's  wrongful\n\nconduct.\n\n          The appealability of orders  \"granting, continuing,\n\nmodifying, refusing or  dissolving\" preliminary  injunctions,\n\n28 U.S.C.   1292(a)(1), fits hand-in-glove with this purpose.\n\nIndeed,  the impetus  behind the  statutory exception  to the\n\n\"final judgment\"  rule that allows an immediate  appeal of an\n\norder  refusing  a  preliminary  injunction  is   to  prevent\n\nirreparable harm to a  litigant who, otherwise, might triumph\n\nat trial but be left holding an empty bag.  See United States\r                                                                         \n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nv.

We think  it\n\nfollows that,  when this  harm-preventing function cannot  be\n\neffectuated by the successful prosecution of an interlocutory\n\nappeal from the denial of interim injunctive relief, then the\n\nviability of the appeal itself is called into question.  See,\r                                                                        \n\ne.g., Bank of  N.Y. Co.  v.

Because WPOR has\n\nfinished  airing its  PAYDAY  contest, this  appeal seeks  to\n\nenjoin  an event that has already fully occurred.  No mandate\n\nthat we might  issue can turn back the pages  of the calendar\n\nand either  stop the  commission of the  allegedly infringing\n\nact or  fully palliate  its effects.   Though federal  courts\n\npossess great authority, they lack the power, once a bell has\n\nbeen  rung,  to  unring   it.    In  short,  no   justiciable\n\ncontroversy exists  because this  appeal can no  longer serve\n\nthe intended  harm-preventing function, or, put  another way,\n\nthis court, within the  isthmian confines of an interlocutory\n\nappeal  from an  order refusing to  restrain a  now completed\n\nact, has no effective relief to offer.\n\n          Our analysis  finds ample support in  the case law.\n\nIt has been common ground throughout the last century that an\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nappeal, although live  when taken,  may be  rendered moot  by\n\nsubsequent developments.   See Mills v. Green, 159  U.S. 651,\r                                                         \n\n653 (1895).  More specifically, \"an appeal from the denial of\n\na motion  for a preliminary injunction is  rendered moot when\n\nthe  act  sought to  be enjoined  has  occurred.\"   McLane v.\r                                                                      \n\nMercedes-Benz of North Am.,  Inc., 3 F.3d 522, 524  (1st Cir.\r                                             \n\n1993); accord Bank  of N.Y.,  9 F.3d at  1067; Oakville  Dev.\r                                                                         \n\nCorp. v.

See\r                                                                         \n\nBank  of N.Y., 9 F.3d at 1067 (explaining that an appeal from\r                         \n\nthe  denial of a motion for preliminary injunction is moot if\n\nthe  appellate  court can  no  longer  preserve, or  feasibly\n\nrestore, the status quo); Oakville, 986 F.2d at 613  (holding\r                                              \n\nthat a  case is moot upon the inability of a court to provide\n\neffective relief in respect to the claim before it).\n\n          We emphasize that appellant's suit  remains pending\n\nin the district court.   Unlike this appeal, the  suit itself\n\nis not moot  because the relief  requested is attainable;  if\n\nappellant ultimately  prevails, the district court  can award\n\nmoney damages,  attorneys' fees, and other  effective relief.\n\nA suit that seeks  damages for harm caused by  past practices\n\nis  not rendered  moot  by the  cessation  of the  challenged\n\nconduct.

Livingston, 30 F.3d 96,\r                                                            \n\n97-98 (8th  Cir. 1994) (explaining that  a judgment declaring\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nan appeal of  a ruling  anent a  preliminary injunction  moot\n\ndoes  not preclude the district court from proceeding to hear\n\nand determine a  claim for  damages arising out  of the  same\n\nconduct); Trane Co.  v.

Both are\n\nblind alleys.\n\n          First, appellant asseverates that  the harm it  has\n\nexperienced may simply be in a state of temporary  remission.\n\nIt  posits that  WPOR,  having run  the allegedly  infringing\n\ncontest once, may  do so again,  and, if it chooses  its time\n\nframe skillfully,  may  continue to  dodge appellate  review.\n\nThe asseveration cannot withstand scrutiny.\n\n          To be sure, the  likely recurrence or repetition of\n\nthe  wrong  sought  to  be  enjoined,  when  coupled  with  a\n\ndemonstrated  tendency to elude review, forms the basis for a\n\nrecognized exception to the application of the mootness rule.\n\nSee  Oakville,  986  F.2d  at  615;  see  also  Southern Pac.\r                                                                         \n\nTerminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911) (holding that a\r                               \n\ncase  is not  moot  if  the  alleged  wrong  is  \"capable  of\n\nrepetition, yet  evading review\").    But, here,  appellant's\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nattempt to invoke this exception lacks at least one necessary\n\ningredient.5   It  is not  enough  that a  consummated  event\n\ncould, theoretically, happen again.   Rather, for an event to\n\nbe \"capable of repetition\" in the requisite sense, there must\n\nbe  a reasonable  expectation  of reoccurrence.   See  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Peters, 754  F.2d 753, 758 (7th Cir.  1985); Trane,\r                                                                        \n\n718 F.2d at 27.\n\n          This is not such  a case.  When questioned  at oral\n\nargument,  appellees' counsel stated  flatly that  WPOR would\n\nrefrain  from revivifying  its contest  until after  the main\n\ncase    which,  as we  have said,  is awaiting  trial in  the\n\ndistrict  court,  see supra  p.7    has  been concluded.   We\r                                       \n\nconsider an express representation by an officer of the court\n\nto be a solemn undertaking, binding on the client, cf., e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nUnited States v.  Coady, 809  F.2d 119, 121  (1st Cir.  1987)\r                                   \n\n(refusing to  countenance  a defendant's  attempt to  retreat\n\nfrom his  attorney's express representation),  and we  expect\n\nthat   it   will  be   honored.      Given  the   stand-still\n\nrepresentation,  the potential for reoccurrence or repetition\n\nof the allegedly wrongful acts is far too exiguous to support\n\ncontinued appellate jurisdiction.\n\n          Appellant's second attempted detour need not detain\n\nus.   CMM contends that  the possibility of  effective relief\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  We take  no view  of whether appellant's  claim satisfies\nthe \"evading review\" prong of the exception.\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nexists  notwithstanding  the end  of  WPOR's  promotion.   It\n\nanchors this contention  on the idea that the  district court\n\ncould  still  enjoin  WPOR  pendente lite  from  reaping  the\r                                                     \n\nbenefits   of  the   increased  listener  database   that  it\n\npresumably acquired  through its  exploitation of the  PAYDAY\n\ncontest.   There are several problems with this argument.  We\n\nneed  not go beyond  its two most  noticeable flaws.   In the\n\nfirst place, CMM never  requested this specific relief during\n\nthe preliminary injunction proceedings in the district court.\n\nConsequently, its argument founders.   A party who   neglects\n\nto  ask the trial court  for relief that  it might reasonably\n\nhave thought would be available  is not entitled to importune\n\nthe court of  appeals to  grant that relief.   See  Dartmouth\r                                                                         \n\nReview v.

If CMM prevails on the  merits, WPOR's\n\nincrease in listenership conceivably  may represent a form of\n\nunjust  enrichment,  calling for  damages  in  the nature  of\n\ndisgorgement.   But an entitlement to  money damages, without\n\nmore, rarely  constitutes an  adequate  basis for  injunctive\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nrelief.

In the\r                  \n\ncircumstances  of  this  case,  WPOR's use  of  a  wrongfully\n\nacquired  database  would  not  meet this  benchmark.    Such\n\nconduct harms only other  radio stations   WPOR's competitors\n\n  not CMM itself.\n\n                              V\r                                          V\n\n          We need go no  further.

CMM   claims  to  have   created  a\n\npromotional contest called \"PAYROLL PAYOFF .\"  In due season,\n\nit  trademarked the  name and  copyrighted various  materials\n\ndesigned  for  use in  executing  promotional  campaigns that\n\nfeatured  the contest.  The  mechanics of PAYROLL PAYOFF  are\n\nnot relevant to the mootness issue, and rehearsing them would\n\nserve no useful purpose.2\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  In point of fact,  the district court did not  deny CMM's\nmotion  for preliminary  injunction outright,  but granted  a\nsmall measure of relief.   On appeal, CMM complains  that the\ncourt  gave it considerably  less than  its due,  drawing the\ninjunction in much too crabbed a fashion.\n\n2.  We refer  readers who thirst  for greater knowledge  to a\nmore   detailed  account  of   the  PAYROLL  PAYOFF   concept\ncontained   in   CMM   Cable    Rep.,   Inc.   v.

Subsequently, a competing  station,\n\nWPOR,3 tried to  acquire the right  to run the contest.   CMM\n\nrefused to  deal out  of loyalty  to WMGX.    WPOR then  took\n\nmatters into its  own hands and \"created\"  (or so it says)  a\n\ncontest-type  promotion,  reminiscent  in  some  respects  of\n\nPAYROLL PAYOFF , called  \"PAYDAY.\"   WPOR began  broadcasting\n\nits PAYDAY contest in the fall of 1994.\n\n                              II\r                                          II\n\n          Unconsoled by  the bromide  that  imitation is  the\n\nsincerest form of  flattery, CMM brought suit  in the federal\n\ndistrict   court  charging,  among  other  things,  copyright\n\ninfringement, trademark infringement, and unfair competition.\n\nCMM's complaint prayed,  inter alia,  for damages,  equitable\r                                               \n\nremedies, and attorneys'  fees.  In  addition, CMM moved  for\n\nboth  temporary and  preliminary  injunctive relief  to  halt\n\nWPOR's use of the PAYDAY contest pendente lite.\r                                                          \n\n          The  district court  refused to  issue  a temporary\n\nrestraining order.   Instead, it held  an evidentiary hearing\n\nand,  on  November 4,  1994,  granted  a limited  preliminary\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Defendant  Ocean  Coast  Properties, Inc.  operates  WPOR\n(sometimes referred to by  plaintiff as WPOR-FM).  Defendants\nRobert Gold,  Phillip Corper, and William  Therriault are all\ninterested  in the  station's  operation.   For  simplicity's\nsake,  we refer to the defendants, collectively, as \"WPOR\" or\n\"appellees.\"\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ninjunction prohibiting further production and distribution of\n\nthe  brochures that  WPOR had  prepared  to help  promote its\n\nPAYDAY  scheme.4   The  court  refused  to enjoin  WPOR  from\n\nproceeding with the contest  proper, however, ruling that CMM\n\nhad shown scant prospects of success on its principal claims.\n\nThis appeal ensued.\n\n          While  the appellate  process  was  underway,  WPOR\n\nmoved  to  dismiss the  appeal on  grounds  of mootness.   In\n\nsupport,  it averred  that  the PAYDAY  contest  had run  its\n\ncourse, and was no  longer being broadcast.  CMM  objected to\n\nthe proposed  dismissal.   Though admitting that  the contest\n\nwas  off  the air,  CMM asserted  that  its appeal  could not\n\nfairly be characterized  as moot.   On February  9, 1995,  we\n\nheard arguments  spanning both  the question of  mootness and\n\nthe merits of the appeal.\n\n                             III\r                                         III\n\n          A   federal  appellate  court   may  only  exercise\n\njurisdiction  over actual  \"cases\" or \"controversies.\"   U.S.\n\nConst. art. III,    2,  cl. 1.   The instant appeal  provides\n\nthis court with no live controversy to resolve, and, thus, we\n\nlack appellate jurisdiction.  We explain briefly.\n\n          This  is an  interlocutory appeal.   It  is brought\n\nstrictly and solely to test whether the district court abused\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  The court  determined that CMM would  probably succeed in\nshowing that the brochures infringed existing copyrights. \n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nits  discretion  in withholding  certain  provisional relief.\n\nThe   relief  sought  is  in  the  nature  of  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction.   The purpose of  a preliminary injunction  is to\n\npreserve the status quo, freezing an existing situation so as\n\nto  permit the  trial court,  upon full  adjudication of  the\n\ncase's merits,  more effectively to remedy  discerned wrongs.\n\nSee Chalk v.

Because WPOR has\n\nfinished  airing its  PAYDAY  contest, this  appeal seeks  to\n\nenjoin  an event that has already fully occurred.  No mandate\n\nthat we might  issue can turn back the pages  of the calendar\n\nand either  stop the  commission of the  allegedly infringing\n\nact or  fully palliate  its effects.

Given  the   stand-still\n\nrepresentation,  the potential for reoccurrence or repetition\n\nof the allegedly wrongful acts is far too exiguous to support\n\ncontinued appellate jurisdiction.\n\n          Appellant's second attempted detour need not detain\n\nus.

It\n\nanchors this contention  on the idea that the  district court\n\ncould  still  enjoin  WPOR  pendente lite  from  reaping  the\r                                                     \n\nbenefits   of  the   increased  listener  database   that  it\n\npresumably acquired  through its  exploitation of the  PAYDAY\n\ncontest.   There are several problems with this argument.  We\n\nneed  not go beyond  its two most  noticeable flaws.   In the\n\nfirst place, CMM never  requested this specific relief during\n\nthe preliminary injunction proceedings in the district court.\n\nConsequently, its argument founders.   A party who   neglects\n\nto  ask the trial court  for relief that  it might reasonably\n\nhave thought would be available  is not entitled to importune\n\nthe court of  appeals to  grant that relief.
