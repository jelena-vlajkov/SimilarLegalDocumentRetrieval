This appeal  arises from an\r                      STAHL, Circuit  Judge.\r                                           \r\n\naction brought by Dr. James Benjamin, Jr., and several of his\r\n\npatients  against  the  Aroostook  Medical  Center  (\"TAMC\"),\r\n\nalleging  the  racially-motivated  termination of  Benjamin's\r\n\nstaff  privileges.1    The   district  court  dismissed   the\r\n\npatients'  claims,  holding  that  they  lacked  standing  to\r\n\nchallenge TAMC's actions.   Subsequently, the court dismissed\r\n\nBenjamin's claims with prejudice, explaining  that Benjamin's\r\n\ncounsel had failed to  make himself available for proceedings\r\n\nand  to respond  to notices  from the court.   We  affirm the\r\n\ndismissal  of the  patients' claims  and modify  the district\r\n\ncourt's  order   dismissing  Benjamin's  claims  so  that  it\r\n\noperates without prejudice.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          On February  12,  1992, Benjamin,  a  physician  of\r\n\nAfrican-American descent, submitted  a completed  application\r\n\nfor  staff   privileges  to  TAMC.    TAMC  did  not  approve\r\n\nBenjamin's  application, but  instead, on  October  12, 1992,\r\n\ngranted  him  a  \"provisional  appointment.\"    Benjamin  had\r\n\nlicenses  to practice  medicine  in California,  Connecticut,\r\n\nMinnesota and Maine, and had received a certification in  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In addition  to  TAMC, the  complaint designates  several\r\nnamed and unnamed TAMC  officers, agents, employees and staff\r\nphysicians as defendants.   For purposes of this  opinion, we\r\nwill refer to all defendants collectively as \"TAMC.\" \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n\"Specialty of  Internal Medicine\" from the  American Board of\r\n\nInternal Medicine.    TAMC, which is located in Presque Isle,\r\n\nMaine, has approximately forty-five physicians on its medical\r\n\nstaff  and  it  does   not  allow  physicians  without  staff\r\n\nprivileges  to treat patients at its facilities.  At the time\r\n\nof  Benjamin's  appointment,  TAMC  had  no  African-American\r\n\nphysician on its staff.\r\n\n          On October 11, 1993, TAMC's Medical Staff Executive\r\n\nCommittee   recommended   that   TAMC  terminate   Benjamin's\r\n\nprovisional staff  privileges.  Subsequently,  on January  7,\r\n\n1994, Benjamin  and seventeen of his  patients commenced this\r\n\naction pro se  in federal district court  alleging that TAMC,\r                         \r\n\nthrough  discriminatory  policies and  practices,  had denied\r\n\nBenjamin  staff  privileges  on  account of  his  race.    On\r\n\nFebruary  11, 1994,  the district  court issued  a scheduling\r\n\norder setting forth discovery deadlines and an expected trial\r\n\ndate  for  August  1994.    The  district court  amended  the\r\n\nscheduling order twice to extend the time, first for Benjamin\r\n\nand then for TAMC,  to designate expert witnesses.   On March\r\n\n4,  1994, TAMC filed a motion to dismiss the patients' claims\r\n\nfor  lack  of standing.    After  Benjamin and  the  patients\r\n\nresponded through newly obtained counsel,  the district court\r\n\ngranted  the  motion,  finding  that  the  patients  had  not\r\n\nsufficiently alleged  that they had  suffered any \"injury-in-\r\n\nfact\" as a result of the hospital's actions.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          On  April  29, 1994,  Benjamin's counsel  sought to\r\n\nwithdraw,  citing  irreconcilable differences  with Benjamin.\r\n\nThe district court granted  the motion, pending an appearance\r\n\nby replacement  counsel (or by Benjamin pro  se).  On May 31,\r                                                           \r\n\n1994, Benjamin's counsel renewed  the motion to withdraw, and\r\n\nthe  district court ordered Benjamin to show cause why he had\r\n\nnot obtained  new counsel.   On June  8, 1994,  TAMC filed  a\r\n\nmotion to dismiss, arguing that  Benjamin had failed to  make\r\n\nhimself available for a  deposition and had obstructed TAMC's\r\n\nefforts  to complete discovery.  Two days later, TAMC filed a\r\n\nsecond motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, arguing\r\n\nthat Benjamin's claims  failed on  the merits.   On June  16,\r\n\n1994, James P. Chandler of Washington, D.C., entered a notice\r\n\nof appearance on behalf  of Benjamin and simultaneously moved\r\n\nto enlarge the time  to respond to TAMC's pending  motions to\r\n\ndismiss.   The  district  court granted  this motion,  giving\r\n\nBenjamin and his new counsel until July 15, 1994, to respond.\r\n\n          On July 7, 1994,  Chandler became seriously ill and\r\n\nwas  hospitalized in  Washington, D.C.   At  the time  of his\r\n\nhospitalization, Chandler had not  responded to TAMC's motion\r\n\nnor consulted  with Benjamin's former  counsel.  On  July 15,\r\n\n1994,  a law  clerk  for  Chandler  moved for  an  additional\r\n\nenlargement of time on  account of Chandler's sudden illness.\r\n\nThe  district court  denied  the motion  in  light of  TAMC's\r\n\nobjection  and   because  it  was  improperly   filed  by  an\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nindividual without authority  to practice  before the  court.\r\n\nOn  August  2,  1994,   Chandler  filed  another  motion  for\r\n\nenlargement  of  time, which  the  district  court denied  by\r\n\nendorsement.\r\n\n          On  August  17, 1994,  the  district  court held  a\r\n\nhearing on TAMC's pending motions to dismiss at which neither\r\n\nChandler  nor   Benjamin  appeared.     Noting   that,  since\r\n\nChandler's  appearance  on  Benjamin's  behalf,  Chandler had\r\n\nneither  made  himself  available  for  any  proceedings  nor\r\n\nresponded  to  notices from  the  court,  the district  court\r\n\ngranted TAMC's motion to dismiss with prejudice.  This appeal\r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          We address two issues on appeal.  First, Benjamin's\r\n\npatients contest the district  court's finding that they lack\r\n\nstanding  to  assert  their  claims against  TAMC.    Second,\r\n\nBenjamin argues that his  counsel's sudden and severe illness\r\n\nshould  excuse  his failure  to  make  himself available  and\r\n\nrespond to notices from the court.\r\n\nA.  The Patients' Claims\r                                    \r\n\n          At  oral  argument, counsel  for  the  patients and\r\n\nBenjamin asserted that the patients' standing argument rested\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nprimarily  on 42 U.S.C.    1981.2  The  patients contend that\r\n\nthey have  standing  because TAMC's  actions interfered  with\r\n\ntheir    1981-protected  right to  contract with  Benjamin, a\r\n\nminority  physician.    TAMC,  however,  maintains  that  the\r\n\npatients themselves have no legally cognizable injury and, at\r\n\nbest, only assert the third-party rights of Benjamin.   After\r\n\ncareful review,  we conclude  that, on  the facts alleged  in\r\n\nthis case, the patients do not have standing.  \r\n\n          The burden of alleging facts necessary to establish\r\n\nstanding  falls   upon  the  party  seeking   to  invoke  the\r\n\njurisdiction of the federal court.

Furthermore, because the  patients have not\r\n\nsatisfied the  minimum requirements  for an exception  to the\r\n\nprudential rule against third-party standing, and because the\r\n\nreasons  underlying the rule obtain  in this case, we believe\r\n\nthe district court did not err in dismissing their claims. \r\n\n          Whether  a party  is asserting  its own  rights, as\r\n\nopposed  to seeking to vindicate the rights of a third party,\r\n\nis often  a  difficult question.

The direct injury in this\r\n\ncase   is  TAMC's   alleged   discriminatory  revocation   of\r\n\nBenjamin's staff privileges, which TAMC directed specifically\r\n\nat Benjamin on account of Benjamin's race.\r\n\n          Furthermore, the patients do not allege that TAMC's\r\n\naction  completely precluded  them from  receiving treatment.\r\n\nTAMC has other physicians on staff who practice in Benjamin's\r\n\nspecialty,  and the  patients  do not  allege  that TAMC  has\r\n\nrefused to admit them as patients.

Here,  because the  merits of  the action  turn\r\n\nlargely on  an evaluation of Benjamin's  performance at TAMC,\r\n\nhe, and not the patients, is clearly the best party to assert\r\n\nthe claim.

Indeed, it  is far  from\r\n\nclear  that the patients,  who would not be  privy to all the\r\n\nparticulars  of  Benjamin's relationship  with  the hospital,\r\n\ncould effectively proceed without Benjamin's participation.\r\n\n          To  summarize, because  the  patients' claims  fall\r\n\noutside what  we, and other courts, have  previously found to\r\n\nbe  protected by   1981,  we believe the  patients assert the\r\n\nthird-party   rights   of  Benjamin   and   not   their  own.\r\n\nFurthermore, because  the patients  have not met  the minimum\r\n\nrequisites  for  third-party  standing,  we  hold  that   the\r\n\ndistrict court did not err in dismissing their claims.\r\n\nB.

Benjamin\r\n\nmaintains  that  the   district  court  granted  the   motion\r\n\nessentially  because  his  counsel  failed  to prosecute  the\r\n\naction  by not  responding  to TAMC's  motion  to dismiss  or\r\n\nappearing  at  the  August  17  hearing.    Benjamin  argues,\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nhowever, that these  failures are excusable  in light of  his\r\n\nattorney's sudden and serious illness.\r\n\n          We treat  the district court's  dismissal as issued\r\n\npursuant  to Rule 41(b).4   We  review  dismissals under Rule\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Fed R. Civ. P. 41(b) provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute\r\n          or  to comply  with  these rules  or  any\r\n          order of court, a  defendant may move for\r\n          dismissal  of an  action or of  any claim\r\n          against  the defendant.  Unless the court\r\n          in  its  order  for  dismissal  otherwise\r\n          specifies,   a   dismissal   under   this\r\n          subdivision   and   any   dismissal   not\r\n          provided for  in this rule,  other than a\r\n          dismissal  for  lack of  jurisdiction for\r\n          improper  venue, or for failure to join a\r\n          party  under  Rule  19,  operates  as  an\r\n          adjudication upon the merits.\r\n\n          TAMC  contends that  the  district court  dismissed\r\nBenjamin's claims pursuant  to Local Rule 19(c)  and not Rule\r\n41(b).  Local Rule 19(c) provides  that the failure to file a\r\ntimely written  response to a  pending motion will  waive any\r\nobjections to that motion.  U.S. Dist. Ct. Me. Gen. R. 19(c).\r\n          Our reading of the district court's order, however,\r\nconvinces us  that it was acting pursuant to Rule 41(b).  The\r\ndistrict  court did not cite Local Rule 19(c) in ordering the\r\ndismissal  of the case.  Neither did the district court state\r\nthat the  dismissal was compelled because  Benjamin's failure\r\nto  respond constituted  a  waiver of  any  objection to  the\r\nmotion.   Instead, the district court  reasoned, \"Because the\r\nplaintiff,  through  counsel,  has  failed  to  make  himself\r\navailable  for any  proceedings since  the appearance  of Mr.\r\nChandler and  since the  plaintiff, through counsel,  has not\r\nresponded to  notices from  the Court, defendant's  Motion to\r\nDismiss   plaintiff's   actions   is   hereby   GRANTED  with\r                                                                   \r\nprejudice.\"    We think  this  rather  terse statement  makes\r\napparent that  the court's  motivation stemmed more  from its\r\ndispleasure  at  Benjamin  and Chandler's  failure  either to\r\nappear  at the hearing or  to notify the  court (and opposing\r\ncounsel) of  their expected  absence, than just  Benjamin and\r\nChandler's (arguably) excusable failure to respond to  TAMC's\r\nmotion to dismiss.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n41(b) for abuse of discretion.

Indeed,  we  have\r\n\nsuggested that,  in  deciding a  motion for  an extension  of\r\n\ntime, a  district court's failure to allow for factors beyond\r\n\na party's control, such as the unexpected illness of counsel,\r\n\nmay,  in a certain  case, constitute an  abuse of discretion.\r\n\nSee Maldonado-Denis v.

See  Simpson v. Welch, 900 F.2d  33, 34-35\r                                                    \r\n\n(4th Cir.  1990) (no abuse of discretion  to dismiss pursuant\r\n\nto  Rule  41(b) where  counsel  did  not respond  to  summary\r\n\njudgment  motion or appear at hearing  on motion).  Moreover,\r\n\nChandler's  failure to  appear occurred  after the  court had\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nalready  extended  the time  to respond  to TAMC's  motion to\r\n\ndismiss upon Chandler's late  appearance in the case.   Cf. 9\r                                                                       \r\n\nCharles A.  Wright &amp; Arthur  R.

TAMC  does  not\r\n\ndispute  that Chandler,  who lives  in Washington,  D.C., was\r\n\nseriously ill.   Indeed,  Chandler had apprised  the district\r\n\ncourt  and opposing  counsel of the  severity of  his illness\r\n\nthrough  two motions for enlargement of time filed on July 15\r\n\nand August 2.  The August 2 motion expressly states that \"The\r\n\nprognosis of  [Chandler's]  primary care  physician  is  that\r\n\n[Chandler]  will not be able to resume his court duties until\r\n\nafter mid-August.\"  Thus, we think that Chandler provided the\r\n\ncourt and TAMC at least some notice that he might not be able\r\n\nto  attend the  August 17  hearing.   Moreover,  the district\r\n\ncourt  scheduled the date of the August 17 hearing only after\r\n\nChandler  filed the  second motion  for enlargement  of time.\r\n\nFinally,  the   litigation,  at  the  time   of  the  court's\r\n\ndismissal, was less than one year old.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n          We sympathize with the district court's frustration\r\n\nin  the face  of counsel's  failure to  appear, and  we fully\r\n\nappreciate the  district court's need to  control its docket.\r\n\nFurthermore,  we  \"wholeheartedly endorse  the  use of  stiff\r\n\nsanctions,  including  dismissal   [with  prejudice],   where\r\n\nappropriate.\"  Velazquez-Rivera v.

While  we agree  that\r\n\nChandler's failure to appear or to notify  the court warrants\r\n\npunishment,  we  believe that,  in  this  case, the  district\r\n\ncourt's  use  of  the  ultimate sanction  of  dismissal  with\r\n\nprejudice was  a step too far.  Hence, we modify the order of\r\n\nthe district court to  a dismissal without prejudice.

Subsequently, the court dismissed Benjamin's claims with prejudice, explaining that Benjamin's counsel had failed to make himself available for proceedings and to respond to notices from the court.  We affirm the dismissal of the patients' claims and modify the district court's order dismissing Benjamin's claims so that it operates without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 12, 1992, Benjamin, a physician of African-American descent, submitted a completed application for staff privileges to TAMC.  TAMC did not approve Benjamin's application, but instead, on October 12, 1992, granted him a \"provisional appointment.\"   Benjamin had licenses to practice medicine in California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Maine, and had received a certification in the \"Specialty of Internal Medicine\" from the American Board of Internal Medicine.  TAMC, which is located in Presque Isle, Maine, has approximately forty-five physicians on its medical staff and it does not allow physicians without staff privileges to treat patients at its facilities.  At the time of Benjamin's appointment, TAMC had no African-American physician on its staff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 11, 1993, TAMC's Medical Staff Executive Committee recommended that TAMC terminate Benjamin's provisional staff privileges.  Subsequently, on January 7, 1994, Benjamin and seventeen of his patients commenced this action pro se in federal district court alleging that TAMC, through discriminatory policies and practices, had denied Benjamin staff privileges on account of his race.  On February 11, 1994, the district court issued a scheduling order setting forth discovery deadlines and an expected trial date for August 1994.  The district court amended the scheduling order twice to extend the time, first for Benjamin and then for TAMC, to designate expert witnesses.  On March 4, 1994, TAMC filed a motion to dismiss the patients' claims for lack of standing.  After Benjamin and the patients responded through newly obtained counsel, the district court granted the motion, finding that the patients had not sufficiently alleged that they had suffered any \"injury-in-fact\" as a result of the hospital's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 1994, Benjamin's counsel sought to withdraw, citing irreconcilable differences with Benjamin.  The district court granted the motion, pending an appearance by replacement counsel (or by Benjamin pro se ).  On May 31, 1994, Benjamin's counsel renewed the motion to withdraw, and the district court ordered Benjamin to show cause why he had not obtained new counsel.  On June 8, 1994, TAMC filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Benjamin had failed to make himself available for a deposition and had obstructed TAMC's efforts to complete discovery.  Two days later, TAMC filed a second motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, arguing that Benjamin's claims failed on the merits.  On June 16, 1994, James P. Chandler of Washington, D.C., entered a notice of appearance on behalf of Benjamin and simultaneously moved to enlarge the time to respond to TAMC's pending motions to dismiss.  The district court granted this motion, giving Benjamin and his new counsel until July 15, 1994, to respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 1994, Chandler became seriously ill and was hospitalized in Washington, D.C.  At the time of his hospitalization, Chandler had not responded to TAMC's motion nor consulted with Benjamin's former counsel.  On July 15, 1994, a law clerk for Chandler moved for an additional enlargement of time on account of Chandler's sudden illness.  The district court denied the motion in light of TAMC's objection and because it was improperly filed by an individual without authority to practice before the court.  On August 2, 1994, Chandler filed another motion for enlargement of time, which the district court denied by endorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 17, 1994, the district court held a hearing on TAMC's pending motions to dismiss at which neither Chandler nor Benjamin appeared.  Noting that, since Chandler's appearance on Benjamin's behalf, Chandler had neither made himself available for any proceedings nor responded to notices from the court, the district court granted TAMC's motion to dismiss with prejudice.  This appeal followed.II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address two issues on appeal.  First, Benjamin's patients contest the district court's finding that they lack standing to assert their claims against TAMC.  Second, Benjamin argues that his counsel's sudden and severe illness should excuse his failure to make himself available and respond to notices from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Patients' Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, counsel for the patients and Benjamin asserted that the patients' standing argument rested primarily on 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The patients contend that they have standing because TAMC's actions interfered with their Sec. 1981-protected right to contract with Benjamin, a minority physician.  TAMC, however, maintains that the patients themselves have no legally cognizable injury and, at best, only assert the third-party rights of Benjamin.  After careful review, we conclude that, on the facts alleged in this case, the patients do not have standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of alleging facts necessary to establish standing falls upon the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 518, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2215, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975);  United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 114 (1st Cir.1992).  We review de novo a district court's standing determination, employing an approach that, in practice, differs little from that used to review motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  AVX Corp., 962 F.2d at 114.   In conducting our review, we are obliged to \"accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and ... construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\"  Warth, 422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. at 2206-07;  see also Adams v. Watson 10 F.3d 915, 919 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Standing is the determination of whether a specific person is the proper party to bring a particular matter to the Court for adjudication.\"   Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction Sec. 2.3, at 48 (1989).  The \"inquiry involves both constitutional limitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.\"  Warth, 422 U.S. at 498, 95 S.Ct. at 2204-05;  see also Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, 4 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir.1993).  The constitutional limitations derive from the language of Article III that provides, inter alia, that federal courts shall resolve disputes involving only \"Cases\" or \"Controversies.\"  AVX Corp., 962 F.2d at 113.   The Supreme Court has interpreted this general constitutional proscription as setting forth three fundamental requisites of standing that every litigant invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts must possess:  (1) injury-in-fact--an invasion of a legally-protected interest that is both concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent;  (2) causation;  and (3) redressability.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136-37, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992);  Libertad v.

These considerations, which militate against standing, principally concern whether the litigant (1) asserts the rights and interests of a third party and not his or her own, (2) presents a claim arguably falling outside the zone of interests protected by the specific law invoked, or (3) advances abstract questions of wide public significance essentially amounting to generalized grievances more appropriately addressed to the representative branches.  Libertad, 53 F.3d at 436.   Consideration of these prudential factors enables the federal judiciary \"to avoid deciding questions of broad social import where no individual rights would be vindicated and to limit access to the federal courts to those litigants best suited to assert a particular claim.\"  Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99-100, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1607-08, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979) (emphasis added);  see also Conservation Law Found. of New England v. Reilly, 950 F.2d 38, 41 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this appeal, we need not resolve whether the patients have met the constitutional requisites of standing, rather we believe that, because the patients' allegedly infringed-upon rights fall outside what we have previously found to be protected by Sec. 1981, the patients essentially assert the third-party rights of Benjamin rather than their own.  Furthermore, because the patients have not satisfied the minimum requirements for an exception to the prudential rule against third-party standing, and because the reasons underlying the rule obtain in this case, we believe the district court did not err in dismissing their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a party is asserting its own rights, as opposed to seeking to vindicate the rights of a third party, is often a difficult question.  See generally, Henry P. Monaghan, Third Party Standing, 84 Colum.L.Rev. 277 (1984).  Though the patients claim a direct infringement of their right to contract with a minority physician, at its essence, we believe their claim is more accurately described as an assertion of Benjamin's third-party right to a race-neutral review process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Primarily, the patients' allegedly infringed-upon rights fall outside what we, and other courts, have previously found to be protected by 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Most cases brought pursuant to Sec. 1981 involve allegations of discriminatory conduct prompted by hostility towards the plaintiff's race.  See Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1989).  Occasionally, however, courts have allowed cases to proceed where a plaintiff challenges a discriminatory action motivated by animosity towards another person's race.  See, e.g., Des Vergnes v. Seekonk Water Dist., 601 F.2d 9, 13-14 (1st Cir.1979);  Winston v. Lear-Siegler, Inc., 558 F.2d 1266, 1268-70 (6th Cir.1977);  DeMatteis v. Eastman Kodak Co., 511 F.2d 306, 311-12 (2d Cir.), modified on other grounds, 520 F.2d 409 (2nd Cir.1975).  Such cases have generally been limited to situations in which the plaintiff was the direct target of the defendant's discriminatory action.  In Des Vergnes, for example, a water district acted directly against the nonminority developer by refusing the developer's request to include a tract of land proposed for low-income minority housing in the water district.  Des Vergnes, 601 F.2d at 11-12.   Consequently, we held that the non-minority developer had standing under Sec. 1981 even though the water district's alleged discriminatory action was motivated by animosity towards the race of the prospective tenants and not the race of the developer.  Id. at 14.   Other cases most typically involve a discriminatory employment action (e.g., firing) taken by an employer directly against a non-minority employee because of that employee's association with, or advocacy of, minorities.  See, e.g., Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 802 F.2d 111, 114 (5th Cir.1986) (white plaintiff fired because married to minority spouse);  Winston, 558 F.2d at 1270 (white employee fired for advocating rights of minority);  cf. Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1266-67 (10th Cir.1989) (white lawyer had standing under Sec. 1981 to sue newspaper that published allegedly false articles about him because he represented minorities).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the patients challenge an action by TAMC neither motivated by animosity towards the patients' race nor specifically targeted at, or taken directly against, the patients.  The patients' alleged injury arises only as a derivative effect of TAMC's administration of its general policies governing the grant and review of physician staff privileges.  Cf. Department of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 720, 110 S.Ct. 1428, 1431-32, 108 L.Ed.2d 701 (1990) (standing may exist where \"enforcement of a restriction against a litigant prevents a third party from entering into a relationship with the litigant (typically a contractual relationship), to which the third party has a legal entitlement\") (emphasis added);  see generally Monaghan, 84 Colum.L.Rev. at 306-11 (discussing the distinction between direct and indirect interference with right to interact as a limit on standing).  The direct injury in this case is TAMC's alleged discriminatory revocation of Benjamin's staff privileges, which TAMC directed specifically at Benjamin on account of Benjamin's race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the patients do not allege that TAMC's action completely precluded them from receiving treatment.  TAMC has other physicians on staff who practice in Benjamin's specialty, and the patients do not allege that TAMC has refused to admit them as patients.  Finally, neither does the fact that Benjamin cannot treat the patients at TAMC completely disrupt the patients' relationship with Benjamin:  TAMC's revocation of Benjamin's staff privileges does not preclude him from treating the patients outside of TAMC facilities.  Accordingly, because the patients' injury occurs, if at all, only as a derivative effect of TAMC's action against Benjamin, we hold that, in attempting to bring their claims under Sec. 1981, they are asserting Benjamin's third-party rights, and not their own.  See Mackey v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 724 F.2d 419, 421-22 (4th Cir.1984) (insurance agent challenging insurer's redlining policy is asserting third-party rights of homeowners);  Capital Nat'l Bank of N.Y. v. McDonald's Corp., 625 F.Supp. 874, 882 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (non-minority lender to minority franchisee asserts only third-party rights of minority franchisee in challenge to franchisor's alleged discriminatory termination of franchisee's contract).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the general proscription on third-party standing is not absolute, Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1370, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991);  Warth, 422 U.S. at 500-01, 95 S.Ct. at 2205-07, no exception to the ban is applicable in this case.  In Powers, the Supreme Court stated that an individual seeking to assert the rights of a third party must, as a prerequisite, satisfy three specific criteria:  \"The litigant must have suffered an 'injury in fact,' ...;  the litigant must have a close relationship to the third party;  and there must exist some hindrance to the third party's ability to protect his or her own interests.\"  Powers, 499 U.S. at 411, 111 S.Ct. at 1370-71 (citations omitted) (emphasis added);  see also Playboy Enters. v. Public Serv.  Comm'n of P.R., 906 F.2d 25, 37-39 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 959, 111 S.Ct. 388, 112 L.Ed.2d 399 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that the patients could satisfy the first two criteria, they clearly fail to establish the third.  No hindrance exists in this case that prevents the third party, Benjamin, from asserting his own rights.  In order to satisfy this criterion, a party must show that some barrier or practical obstacle (e.g., third party is unidentifiable, lacks sufficient interest, or will suffer some sanction) prevents or deters the third party from asserting his or her own interest.  See, e.g., Powers, 499 U.S. at 414-15, 111 S.Ct. at 1372-73 (lack of economic incentive);  Clifton Terrace Assocs. v. United Technologies Corp., 929 F.2d 714, 721 (D.C.Cir.1991) (no barriers because, inter alia, third parties are plainly identifiable);  Playboy Enters., 906 F.2d at 37-38 (threat of official sanction)  Here, the injured party is clearly identified and has sufficient interest in the litigation (e.g., professional reputation) to pursue (and, in fact, has pursued) the action.  Accordingly, the patients have not met the minimum requisites for third-party standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, our holding, that Benjamin, and not the patients, is the proper party to bring an action against TAMC, is consistent with the policies underlying the prudential rule against third-party standing.  See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (general proscription on third-party standing may be avoided where the \"underlying justifications are absent\").  Indeed, one of the principal justifications for the rule is that it assures that the party bringing the litigation will be the \"most effective advocate of the rights at issue.\"  Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl.  Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 80, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2634, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978);  see also Secretary of State v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 955, 104 S.Ct. 2839, 2846, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984) (rule against third-party standing guarantees that issues essential to litigation will be \"concrete and sharply presented\").  Here, because the merits of the action turn largely on an evaluation of Benjamin's performance at TAMC, he, and not the patients, is clearly the best party to assert the claim.  Not only would Benjamin be best able to contest TAMC's assertion of professional incompetence, but, in addition, he would likely be far more able to point to specific instances of conduct attributable to TAMC that suggest a discriminatory motive.  Indeed, it is far from clear that the patients, who would not be privy to all the particulars of Benjamin's relationship with the hospital, could effectively proceed without Benjamin's participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, because the patients' claims fall outside what we, and other courts, have previously found to be protected by Sec. 1981, we believe the patients assert the third-party rights of Benjamin and not their own.  Furthermore, because the patients have not met the minimum requisites for third-party standing, we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Benjamin's Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin contends that the district court erred in granting TAMC's motion to dismiss with prejudice.  Benjamin maintains that the district court granted the motion essentially because his counsel failed to prosecute the action by not responding to TAMC's motion to dismiss or appearing at the August 17 hearing.  Benjamin argues, however, that these failures are excusable in light of his attorney's sudden and serious illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We treat the district court's dismissal as issued pursuant to Rule 41(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We review dismissals under Rule 41(b) for abuse of discretion.  Capo v. United States, 7 F.3d 283, 284 (1st Cir.1993);  Enlace Mercantil Internacional, Inc. v. Senior Indus., Inc., 848 F.2d 315, 317 (1st Cir.1988).  Claims of abuse of discretion under Rule 41(b) typically have \"not received a sympathetic ear from us.\"  Damiani v. Rhode Island Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1983) (collecting cases).  At the same time, this \"does not mean we have rubber-stamped the decisions of the district court.\"  Id.  Dismissal with prejudice \"is a harsh sanction,\" Richman v. General Motors Corp., 437 F.2d 196, 199 (1st Cir.1971), which runs counter to our \"strong policy favoring the disposition of cases on the merits.\"  Zavala Santiago v. Gonzalez Rivera, 553 F.2d 710, 712 (1st Cir.1977).  As a result, we have indicated that such an option should be employed only when a plaintiff's misconduct is particularly egregious or extreme.  See, e.g., Estate of Solis-Rivera v. United States, 993 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Cosme Nieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1987) (\"[i]n all the cases in which we have upheld a dismissal for want of prosecution, we have found either extremely protracted inaction (measured in years), disobedience of court orders, ignorance of warnings, contumacious conduct or some other aggravating circumstance\").  In reviewing the trial court's actions, we engage in an \"open-ended balancing test,\" giving appropriate consideration to all relevant factors.  Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria, 896 F.2d 645, 648 (1st Cir.1990);  see also HMG Property Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc., 847 F.2d 908, 917 n. 13 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court's order ensued solely because Attorney Chandler's sudden illness prevented him from responding to TAMC's motion to dismiss, Benjamin's argument would have significantly more bite.  Indeed, we have suggested that, in deciding a motion for an extension of time, a district court's failure to allow for factors beyond a party's control, such as the unexpected illness of counsel, may, in a certain case, constitute an abuse of discretion.  See Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 584 (1st Cir.1994) (finding no abuse of discretion in denial of motion for enlargement of time where, inter alia, party does not advert to \"circumstances beyond a party's control, such as an attorney's illness\");  cf. Smith-Weik Mach. Corp. v. Murdock Mach. &amp; Eng'g Co., 423 F.2d 842, 844 (5th Cir.1970).  In this case, however, other factors obtain, most importantly Chandler's failure to appear at the August 17 hearing or to notify the court and opposing counsel in advance of his expected absence.  See Simpson v. Welch, 900 F.2d 33, 34-35 (4th Cir.1990) (no abuse of discretion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 41(b) where counsel did not respond to summary judgment motion or appear at hearing on motion).  Moreover, Chandler's failure to appear occurred after the court had already extended the time to respond to TAMC's motion to dismiss upon Chandler's late appearance in the case.  Cf. 9 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2352, at 402 (2d ed. 1995) (prior delays relevant in evaluating denial of continuance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, though Chandler's failure to notify the district court and opposing counsel that he would not be present at the August 17 hearing cannot be overlooked, we believe that, when viewed in context, the egregiousness of his conduct becomes somewhat mitigated.  TAMC does not dispute that Chandler, who lives in Washington, D.C., was seriously ill.  Indeed, Chandler had apprised the district court and opposing counsel of the severity of his illness through two motions for enlargement of time filed on July 15 and August 2.  The August 2 motion expressly states that \"The prognosis of [Chandler's] primary care physician is that [Chandler] will not be able to resume his court duties until after mid-August.\"   Thus, we think that Chandler provided the court and TAMC at least some notice that he might not be able to attend the August 17 hearing.  Moreover, the district court scheduled the date of the August 17 hearing only after Chandler filed the second motion for enlargement of time.  Finally, the litigation, at the time of the court's dismissal, was less than one year old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sympathize with the district court's frustration in the face of counsel's failure to appear, and we fully appreciate the district court's need to control its docket.  Furthermore, we \"wholeheartedly endorse the use of stiff sanctions, including dismissal [with prejudice], where appropriate.\"  Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 920 F.2d 1072, 1079 (1st Cir.1990).  While we agree that Chandler's failure to appear or to notify the court warrants punishment, we believe that, in this case, the district court's use of the ultimate sanction of dismissal with prejudice was a step too far.  Hence, we modify the order of the district court to a dismissal without prejudice.  See 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2373, at 402 (\"The decision of the trial court to dismiss with prejudice may be reviewed on appeal and the appellate court may order the dismissal to be without prejudice.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of the patients' claims and modify the district court's order dismissing Benjamin's claims to operate without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition to TAMC, the complaint designates several named and unnamed TAMC officers, agents, employees and staff physicians as defendants.

[T]he source of the plaintiff's claim to relief assumes critical importance with respect to the prudential rules of standing that, apart from Art.  III's minimum requirements, serve to limit the role of the courts in resolving public disputes.  Essentially, the standing question in such cases, is whether the constitutional or statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting a person in the plaintiff's position a right to judicial relief</p>\n        <p>Warth, 422 U.S. at 500, 95 S.Ct. at 2206.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) provides in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against the defendant.  Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.</p>\n        <p>TAMC contends that the district court dismissed Benjamin's claims pursuant to Local Rule 19(c) and not Rule 41(b).  Local Rule 19(c) provides that the failure to file a timely written response to a pending motion will waive any objections to that motion.  U.S.Dist.Ct.Me.Gen.R. 19(c).</p>\n        <p>Our reading of the district court's order, however, convinces us that it was acting pursuant to Rule 41(b).  The district court did not cite Local Rule 19(c) in ordering the dismissal of the case.  Neither did the district court state that the dismissal was compelled because Benjamin's failure to respond constituted a waiver of any objection to the motion.  Instead, the district court reasoned, \"Because the plaintiff, through counsel, has failed to make himself available for any proceedings since the appearance of Mr. Chandler and since the plaintiff, through counsel, has not responded to notices from the Court, defendant's Motion to Dismiss plaintiff's actions is hereby GRANTED with prejudice.\"   We think this rather terse statement makes apparent that the court's motivation stemmed more from its displeasure at Benjamin and Chandler's failure either to appear at the hearing or to notify the court (and opposing counsel) of their expected absence, than just Benjamin and Chandler's (arguably) excusable failure to respond to TAMC's motion to dismiss.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Subsequently, the court dismissed Benjamin's claims with prejudice, explaining that Benjamin's counsel had failed to make himself available for proceedings and to respond to notices from the court.  We affirm the dismissal of the patients' claims and modify the district court's order dismissing Benjamin's claims so that it operates without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 12, 1992, Benjamin, a physician of African-American descent, submitted a completed application for staff privileges to TAMC.  TAMC did not approve Benjamin's application, but instead, on October 12, 1992, granted him a \"provisional appointment.\"   Benjamin had licenses to practice medicine in California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Maine, and had received a certification in the \"Specialty of Internal Medicine\" from the American Board of Internal Medicine.  TAMC, which is located in Presque Isle, Maine, has approximately forty-five physicians on its medical staff and it does not allow physicians without staff privileges to treat patients at its facilities.  At the time of Benjamin's appointment, TAMC had no African-American physician on its staff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 11, 1993, TAMC's Medical Staff Executive Committee recommended that TAMC terminate Benjamin's provisional staff privileges.  Subsequently, on January 7, 1994, Benjamin and seventeen of his patients commenced this action pro se in federal district court alleging that TAMC, through discriminatory policies and practices, had denied Benjamin staff privileges on account of his race.  On February 11, 1994, the district court issued a scheduling order setting forth discovery deadlines and an expected trial date for August 1994.  The district court amended the scheduling order twice to extend the time, first for Benjamin and then for TAMC, to designate expert witnesses.  On March 4, 1994, TAMC filed a motion to dismiss the patients' claims for lack of standing.  After Benjamin and the patients responded through newly obtained counsel, the district court granted the motion, finding that the patients had not sufficiently alleged that they had suffered any \"injury-in-fact\" as a result of the hospital's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 1994, Benjamin's counsel sought to withdraw, citing irreconcilable differences with Benjamin.  The district court granted the motion, pending an appearance by replacement counsel (or by Benjamin pro se ).  On May 31, 1994, Benjamin's counsel renewed the motion to withdraw, and the district court ordered Benjamin to show cause why he had not obtained new counsel.  On June 8, 1994, TAMC filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Benjamin had failed to make himself available for a deposition and had obstructed TAMC's efforts to complete discovery.  Two days later, TAMC filed a second motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, arguing that Benjamin's claims failed on the merits.  On June 16, 1994, James P. Chandler of Washington, D.C., entered a notice of appearance on behalf of Benjamin and simultaneously moved to enlarge the time to respond to TAMC's pending motions to dismiss.  The district court granted this motion, giving Benjamin and his new counsel until July 15, 1994, to respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 1994, Chandler became seriously ill and was hospitalized in Washington, D.C.  At the time of his hospitalization, Chandler had not responded to TAMC's motion nor consulted with Benjamin's former counsel.  On July 15, 1994, a law clerk for Chandler moved for an additional enlargement of time on account of Chandler's sudden illness.  The district court denied the motion in light of TAMC's objection and because it was improperly filed by an individual without authority to practice before the court.  On August 2, 1994, Chandler filed another motion for enlargement of time, which the district court denied by endorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 17, 1994, the district court held a hearing on TAMC's pending motions to dismiss at which neither Chandler nor Benjamin appeared.  Noting that, since Chandler's appearance on Benjamin's behalf, Chandler had neither made himself available for any proceedings nor responded to notices from the court, the district court granted TAMC's motion to dismiss with prejudice.  This appeal followed.II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address two issues on appeal.  First, Benjamin's patients contest the district court's finding that they lack standing to assert their claims against TAMC.  Second, Benjamin argues that his counsel's sudden and severe illness should excuse his failure to make himself available and respond to notices from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Patients' Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, counsel for the patients and Benjamin asserted that the patients' standing argument rested primarily on 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The patients contend that they have standing because TAMC's actions interfered with their Sec. 1981-protected right to contract with Benjamin, a minority physician.  TAMC, however, maintains that the patients themselves have no legally cognizable injury and, at best, only assert the third-party rights of Benjamin.  After careful review, we conclude that, on the facts alleged in this case, the patients do not have standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of alleging facts necessary to establish standing falls upon the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this general constitutional proscription as setting forth three fundamental requisites of standing that every litigant invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts must possess:  (1) injury-in-fact--an invasion of a legally-protected interest that is both concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent;  (2) causation;  and (3) redressability.

These considerations, which militate against standing, principally concern whether the litigant (1) asserts the rights and interests of a third party and not his or her own, (2) presents a claim arguably falling outside the zone of interests protected by the specific law invoked, or (3) advances abstract questions of wide public significance essentially amounting to generalized grievances more appropriately addressed to the representative branches.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695145\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Libertad,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/695145/lydia-libertad-v-father-patrick-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>.

Furthermore, because the patients have not satisfied the minimum requirements for an exception to the prudential rule against third-party standing, and because the reasons underlying the rule obtain in this case, we believe the district court did not err in dismissing their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a party is asserting its own rights, as opposed to seeking to vindicate the rights of a third party, is often a difficult question.  See generally, Henry P. Monaghan, Third Party Standing, 84 Colum.L.Rev. 277 (1984).  Though the patients claim a direct infringement of their right to contract with a minority physician, at its essence, we believe their claim is more accurately described as an assertion of Benjamin's third-party right to a race-neutral review process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Primarily, the patients' allegedly infringed-upon rights fall outside what we, and other courts, have previously found to be protected by 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Most cases brought pursuant to Sec. 1981 involve allegations of discriminatory conduct prompted by hostility towards the plaintiff's race.

Occasionally, however, courts have allowed cases to proceed where a plaintiff challenges a discriminatory action motivated by animosity towards another person's race.  See, e.g., Des Vergnes v.

Such cases have generally been limited to situations in which the plaintiff was the direct target of the defendant's discriminatory action.  In Des Vergnes, for example, a water district acted directly against the nonminority developer by refusing the developer's request to include a tract of land proposed for low-income minority housing in the water district.  Des <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367231\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Vergnes,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/367231/roger-g-des-vergnes-v-seekonk-water-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">11-12</span></a></span>.   Consequently, we held that the non-minority developer had standing under Sec. 1981 even though the water district's alleged discriminatory action was motivated by animosity towards the race of the prospective tenants and not the race of the developer.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367231\"><a href=\"/opinion/367231/roger-g-des-vergnes-v-seekonk-water-district/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 14. </a></span>  Other cases most typically involve a discriminatory employment action (e.g., firing) taken by an employer directly against a non-minority employee because of that employee's association with, or advocacy of, minorities.

The direct injury in this case is TAMC's alleged discriminatory revocation of Benjamin's staff privileges, which TAMC directed specifically at Benjamin on account of Benjamin's race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the patients do not allege that TAMC's action completely precluded them from receiving treatment.  TAMC has other physicians on staff who practice in Benjamin's specialty, and the patients do not allege that TAMC has refused to admit them as patients.  Finally, neither does the fact that Benjamin cannot treat the patients at TAMC completely disrupt the patients' relationship with Benjamin:  TAMC's revocation of Benjamin's staff privileges does not preclude him from treating the patients outside of TAMC facilities.  Accordingly, because the patients' injury occurs, if at all, only as a derivative effect of TAMC's action against Benjamin, we hold that, in attempting to bring their claims under Sec. 1981, they are asserting Benjamin's third-party rights, and not their own.

Here, because the merits of the action turn largely on an evaluation of Benjamin's performance at TAMC, he, and not the patients, is clearly the best party to assert the claim.  Not only would Benjamin be best able to contest TAMC's assertion of professional incompetence, but, in addition, he would likely be far more able to point to specific instances of conduct attributable to TAMC that suggest a discriminatory motive.  Indeed, it is far from clear that the patients, who would not be privy to all the particulars of Benjamin's relationship with the hospital, could effectively proceed without Benjamin's participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, because the patients' claims fall outside what we, and other courts, have previously found to be protected by Sec. 1981, we believe the patients assert the third-party rights of Benjamin and not their own.

Indeed, we have suggested that, in deciding a motion for an extension of time, a district court's failure to allow for factors beyond a party's control, such as the unexpected illness of counsel, may, in a certain case, constitute an abuse of discretion.  See Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195359\"><a href=\"/opinion/195359/denis-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 584 (1st Cir.1994) (finding no abuse of discretion in denial of motion for enlargement of time where, inter alia, party does not advert to \"circumstances beyond a party's control, such as an attorney's illness\");  cf. Smith-Weik Mach. Corp. v. Murdock Mach. &amp; Eng'g Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"289176\"><a href=\"/opinion/289176/smith-weik-machinery-corporation-etc-v-murdock-machine-and-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></a></span>, 844 (5th Cir.1970).  In this case, however, other factors obtain, most importantly Chandler's failure to appear at the August 17 hearing or to notify the court and opposing counsel in advance of his expected absence.  See Simpson v. Welch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539224\"><a href=\"/opinion/539224/helen-l-simpson-v-nancy-welch-md-health-director-chesapeake/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 34-35 (4th Cir.1990) (no abuse of discretion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 41(b) where counsel did not respond to summary judgment motion or appear at hearing on motion).  Moreover, Chandler's failure to appear occurred after the court had already extended the time to respond to TAMC's motion to dismiss upon Chandler's late appearance in the case.  Cf. 9 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2352, at 402 (2d ed. 1995) (prior delays relevant in evaluating denial of continuance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, though Chandler's failure to notify the district court and opposing counsel that he would not be present at the August 17 hearing cannot be overlooked, we believe that, when viewed in context, the egregiousness of his conduct becomes somewhat mitigated.  TAMC does not dispute that Chandler, who lives in Washington, D.C., was seriously ill.  Indeed, Chandler had apprised the district court and opposing counsel of the severity of his illness through two motions for enlargement of time filed on July 15 and August 2.  The August 2 motion expressly states that \"The prognosis of [Chandler's] primary care physician is that [Chandler] will not be able to resume his court duties until after mid-August.\"   Thus, we think that Chandler provided the court and TAMC at least some notice that he might not be able to attend the August 17 hearing.  Moreover, the district court scheduled the date of the August 17 hearing only after Chandler filed the second motion for enlargement of time.  Finally, the litigation, at the time of the court's dismissal, was less than one year old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sympathize with the district court's frustration in the face of counsel's failure to appear, and we fully appreciate the district court's need to control its docket.  Furthermore, we \"wholeheartedly endorse the use of stiff sanctions, including dismissal [with prejudice], where appropriate.\"  Velazquez-Rivera v.

While we agree that Chandler's failure to appear or to notify the court warrants punishment, we believe that, in this case, the district court's use of the ultimate sanction of dismissal with prejudice was a step too far.  Hence, we modify the order of the district court to a dismissal without prejudice.  See 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2373, at 402 (\"The decision of the trial court to dismiss with prejudice may be reviewed on appeal and the appellate court may order the dismissal to be without prejudice.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of the patients' claims and modify the district court's order dismissing Benjamin's claims to operate without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition to TAMC, the complaint designates several named and unnamed TAMC officers, agents, employees and staff physicians as defendants.

[T]he source of the plaintiff's claim to relief assumes critical importance with respect to the prudential rules of standing that, apart from Art.

Local Rule 19(c) provides that the failure to file a timely written response to a pending motion will waive any objections to that motion.  U.S.Dist.Ct.Me.Gen.R. 19(c).</p>\n        <p>Our reading of the district court's order, however, convinces us that it was acting pursuant to Rule 41(b).  The district court did not cite Local Rule 19(c) in ordering the dismissal of the case.  Neither did the district court state that the dismissal was compelled because Benjamin's failure to respond constituted a waiver of any objection to the motion.  Instead, the district court reasoned, \"Because the plaintiff, through counsel, has failed to make himself available for any proceedings since the appearance of Mr. Chandler and since the plaintiff, through counsel, has not responded to notices from the Court, defendant's Motion to Dismiss plaintiff's actions is hereby GRANTED with prejudice.\"   We think this rather terse statement makes apparent that the court's motivation stemmed more from its displeasure at Benjamin and Chandler's failure either to appear at the hearing or to notify the court (and opposing counsel) of their expected absence, than just Benjamin and Chandler's (arguably) excusable failure to respond to TAMC's motion to dismiss.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
