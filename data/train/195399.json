This admiralty action stems from a\n          CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\nnighttime collision  approximately four  miles off the  island of\n\nCulebra,  Puerto Rico, between the 65-foot  sailboat GLORIA and a\n\n262-foot  barge  under tow  by  the tugboat  BORINQUEN,  owned by\n\ndefendant-appellant  Crowley Towing and  Transportation Co., Inc.\n\nThe five plaintiffs,  the captain  and crew of  the GLORIA,  were\n\nforced  to  abandon her  moments  before the  collision  and were\n\nrescued several hours later. \n\n          Following a ten-day trial in the United States District\n\nCourt for the  District of  Puerto Rico, a  jury found  Crowley's\n\nnegligence the sole  cause of the collision,  and awarded damages\n\ntotalling $1,661,700.1   Judgment entered  on July 24, 1992.   On\n\nAugust 7,  plaintiffs filed  a motion  to amend  the  judgment to\n\nprovide for attorney fees,  prejudgment interest, and  extraordi-\n\nnary  costs.   As  the Rule  59(e)  motion was  not  served until\n\nAugust 11, it was  summarily denied.  See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 59(e).\n                                         \n\nMeanwhile, Crowley  had  renewed its  motion  for judgment  as  a\n\nmatter of law or for  new trial, which the district  court denied\n\non November 18.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b).   Crowley now appeals\n                    \n\nboth  the final  judgment and  the order  denying its  Rule 50(b)\n\nmotion  for new trial  or for judgment  as a matter of  law.  The\n\nplaintiffs  cross-appeal  from the  denial  of  their Rule  59(e)\n\nmotion to amend the judgment.  \n\n                    \n\n     1At  the end of  plaintiffs' case and again  at the close of\nthe  evidence, Crowley  unsuccessfully  moved for  judgment as  a\nmatter of law, see Fed.

Liability\n                   \n\n          On  appeal,  Crowley  contends,  inter alia,  that  the\n                                                     \n\nspecial  jury verdict on liability is contrary to the evidence on\n\ncomparative fault.\n\n          a.

Violation of COLREGS\n                                   \n\n          Appellant  Crowley  argues  that  the  failure  of  the\n\nGLORIA's crew to take  appropriate evasive action or to  call the\n\ncaptain in time to avoid the collision violated the International\n\nRegulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea  (COLREGS).2  As the\n\nevidence  supports the  special verdict  absolving plaintiffs  of\n\nfault, we reject Crowley's challenge.\n\n          Plaintiffs'  expert,  Captain Jose  Rivera  Tolinche, a\n\nmaster mariner,  testified that  the GLORIA followed  proper col-\n\nlision-avoidance  procedure.3   Captain  Rivera stated  that  the\n\nGLORIA was placed \"in extremis\" through no fault of her own.  The\n                              \n\nin  extremis rule  provides that  \"where one  ship has,  by wrong\n            \n\nmanoeuvres, placed  another ship in a position of extreme danger,\n\n                    \n\n     2Crowley's allegations that the GLORIA  violated the COLREGS\nimplicate the admiralty causation presumption under the \"Pennsyl-\nvania Rule.\"  See The  Pennsylvania, 86 U.S. (19 Wall.)  125, 136\n                                   \n(1874).  Under  the Pennsylvania  Rule, a vessel  shown to be  in\nactual violation of a  collision-prevention rule bears the burden\nof  proving that  her fault  could not  have been  a contributing\n                                      \ncause of the accident.

Sea Fever  Corp., 692\n                                                            \nF.2d 163, 167 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n     3Since the sailboat GLORIA  was the \"privileged\" vessel, see\n                                                                 \nCOLREGS, Rule  18(a)(iv) (power-driven  vessel shall keep  out of\nway of sailing  vessel), the \"default passing  rule\" required her\nto  hold course  and speed,  id. Rule  17(a)(i), until  it became\n                                \napparent  that  the BORINQUEN,  the  \"burdened  vessel,\" was  not\ntaking appropriate action to  avoid collision, at which time  the\nGLORIA was allowed  to manoeuvre  to avoid collision,  id.

At the point  at which the collision could no  longer\nbe avoided by unilateral action on the part of the BORINQUEN, the\nGLORIA was required to take action to avoid a collision.  See id.\n                                                                 \nRule 17(b).\n\n                                4\n\nthat  other ship will not be held  to blame if she has done some-\n\nthing wrong.\"  Puerto  Rico Ports Auth. v.

Crowley's argument is foreclosed on appeal, however,  by\nCaptain Rivera's  testimony, which  formed an adequate  basis for\nthe jury  finding that  \"the tug  BORINQUEN place[d]  the GLORIA,\nthrough no  fault of her own,  in a position of  extreme danger .\n                            \n. . .\"  (Emphasis added).\n\n     5Crowley now contends, for  the first time, that plaintiffs'\nconceded failure  to establish  radio contact with  the BORINQUEN\nviolated COLREGS, Rule 2 (in  complying with COLREGS, due  regard\nshall be had to  all dangers of navigation and  collision), since\nthe watch  aboard the GLORIA sighted  the BORINQUEN approximately\nthirty-five minutes prior to the collision.

Thus,  in addition  to\n\nCrowley's failure to establish  a causal relationship between the\n\ncollision and any  alleged negligence  on the part  of the  crew,\n\nthere  was adequate  support for  a jury  finding that  the crew,\n\nindividually and collectively, possessed the requisite competence\n\nand qualifications. \n\n          d.

Hagemann is a\nGerman-certified  able  seafarer,  whose  ten  years  of  sailing\nexperience included many  voyages as  a crewman, and  one or  two\ntrips as  the skipper of a  vessel similar to the  GLORIA.  Stach\nand Van der Ark had taken courses in basic seamanship.  Paschedag\nhad  served as  a  crewmember on  at  least three  prior  sailing\nvoyages in Europe  and the Caribbean, including a  two-week stint\nin the Aegean Sea.  \n\n                                6\n\nverdict on comparative fault.  Hagemann, an experienced mechanic,\n\ntestified  to  proper  maintenance  and  repair  of  the  engine.\n\nCaptain  Rivera provided  expert  testimony that  the GLORIA  was\n\nseaworthy.  As Crowley has neither shown that the special verdict\n\non comparative fault  was against  the clear weight  of the  evi-\n\ndence,  nor that  the district  court erred  in denying  the Rule\n\n50(b)  motion  for judgment  as a  matter  of law,  the liability\n\njudgment against Crowley must stand. \n\n     2.

Maritime  Overseas Corp., 991  F.2d 5,  11\n                                               \n\n(1st \n\nCir.  1993), the  evidence relating  to damages  was  as follows.\n\nPlaintiffs Hagemann and Paschedag, who were standing watch aboard\n\nthe GLORIA,  first saw the BORINQUEN's running lights at approxi-\n\nmately 2:55 a.m.  As  the BORINQUEN changed course at  3:24 a.m.,\n\nHagemann anticipated  that she  would pass on  the GLORIA's  port\n\nside  in accordance with the COLREGS.  As Hagemann soon realized,\n\nhowever, the  BORINQUEN instead  was assuming a  collision course\n\nwith the GLORIA,  so he attempted  to bring  the GLORIA to  star-\n\nboard.  Unable to steer the GLORIA clear of the BORINQUEN without\n\nmotor power,  Hagemann tried unsuccessfully to  start her engine.\n\nPaschedag frantically  attempted to signal the  BORINQUEN with an\n\nair horn and  a marine light, to no avail.   Hagemann then yelled\n\nfor  Captain Havinga  and the  two other  crew members,  who were\n\nasleep below.  Although Havinga quickly came on deck, by the time\n\nhe could take the  helm and attempt evasive maneuvers  the BORIN-\n\nQUEN was within 60 feet and coming on \"very fast.\"8  \n\n                    \n\n     8The parties stipulated that the BORINQUEN changed course at\n3:24 a.m.  There was testimony that this course change placed the\nGLORIA in extremis.  The helmsman of the BORINQUEN testified that\n                  \nthe course change took \"about five minutes,\" \"more or less.\"   At\nsome point between  3:24 and 3:30,  Hagemann recognized that  the\ntug  was  assuming  a collision  course,  placing  the  GLORIA in\n                                                                 \nextremis.  Thus,  as approximately one minute  passed between the\n        \nnarrow  miss by the  BORINQUEN and the first  impact with the tow\nbarge  (at 3:30), the jury  reasonably could have  found that the\nGLORIA  had no  more than  two to three  minutes within  which to\nattempt to avoid the collision.  \n\n                                11\n\n          The BORINQUEN  herself narrowly missed the  GLORIA.  As\n\nthe vessels passed, however, a 200-meter steel tow cable connect-\n\ning the BORINQUEN with  its 262-foot tow barge scraped  along the\n\ndeck of  the GLORIA, crushing objects  in its path.   As the huge\n\nbarge bore  down  on the  65-foot GLORIA,  plaintiffs could  only\n\nawait  the  impending  collision  in helpless  panic.9    Moments\n\nbefore the initial impact at 3:30 a.m., Havinga, fearing that the\n\nGLORIA would be dragged  under the barge, ordered the  crew over-\n\nboard.   Before the men could respond, however, they were knocked\n\noff  their feet  by the  force of  the first of  three collisions\n\nbetween the barge and  the GLORIA.  The GLORIA swayed  90 degrees\n\nto  the horizontal  several  times before  righting herself,  and\n\nrapidly  drifted away.   The  plaintiffs could  see  the helmsman\n\naboard the BORINQUEN as the  barge passed them in the water,  but\n\nwere unable to attract attention aboard the BORINQUEN.\n\n          Eventually  the  five plaintiffs  made  it  to a  small\n\nrubber dinghy which Stach  had managed to throw from  the GLORIA,\n\nher life  boat having been lost  in the collision.   Due to their\n\nconfusion and panic, as well as  the darkness and rough seas, the\n\ncrew  had great  difficulty reaching  the dinghy,  and Stach  and\n\nPaschedag nearly drowned.   The dinghy was large enough  for only\n\ntwo or three  persons, and  the five plaintiffs  were piled  two-\n\ndeep.   Havinga, Van der Ark, and Stach had lost all their cloth-\n\ning, and shared  the little  clothing worn by  Hagemann and  Pas-\n\n                    \n\n     9Approximately sixty seconds elapsed  between the passing of\nthe BORINQUEN  itself and  the GLORIA's initial  impact with  the\ntrailing barge.  See supra note 8.\n                          \n\n                                12\n\nchedag.   The men  shivered uncontrollably, their  situation made\n\nmore  miserable  by Havinga's  incontinence  and  the sea  swells\n\nwashing over the sides of the dinghy.\n\n          At trial,  each plaintiff testified to  his own experi-\n\nence  and  emotional  state,  including  shock,  hysteria, panic,\n\ndesperation, and fear of death.  All were concerned about sharks.\n\nDue  to his  merchant  marine experience,  Havinga realized  (and\n\nadvised  Hagemann) that  sharks often  follow  barges to  feed on\n\nscraps  lost overboard.  Their fears were reinforced when Van der\n\nArk and others  observed fins around and beneath the dinghy.  The\n\nmen  knew that  even  a glancing  contact  with a  shark's  rough\n\nexterior could puncture and sink the rubber dinghy.  At the first\n\nappearance of sharks, therefore,  further efforts at paddling the\n\ndinghy were abandoned.  While  awaiting rescue, on several  occa-\n\nsions plaintiffs  experienced elation upon seeing  an approaching\n\nvessel (one within 300 yards), only to have their hopes dashed as\n\neach  vessel passed in the darkness.  Approximately four and one-\n\nhalf hours  after the collision,  plaintiffs were rescued  by the\n\ntug FAJARDO.\n\n          The individual plaintiffs  testified to their  pain and\n\nsuffering  and loss of enjoyment of  life following the accident.\n\nDr. Jose Fumero,  plaintiffs' examining psychiatrist,  testified,\n\nwithout objection,  that the  plaintiffs all suffered  from acute\n\npost-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD),10 a direct  result of the\n\n                    \n\n     10Dr. Fumero testified that  PTSD is an acknowledged anxiety\ndisorder, see American Psychiatric Assoc., Diagnostic and Statis-\n                                                                 \ntical Manual of Mental  Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, 247-49\n                                                         \n\n                                13\n\naccident.

See id. at 250.\n                       \n\n     11According to Dr. Fumero, the GAF assesses  and compares an\nindividual's current  level of  emotional function with  his pre-\naccident level of function.\n\n     12With respect to the severity of their injuries, Dr. Fumero\ntestified to  the diminishment  in each  plaintiff's pre-accident\nemotional function as a result of the accident:  Havinga (from 90\nto 65); Stach (75 to 50); Van der Ark (85 to 60); Hagemann (90 to\n\n                                14\n\nThus, the evidence, argument, and the unchallenged charge allowed\n\nthe jury considerable latitude to  award substantial sums as non-\n\neconomic damages to compensate plaintiffs not only for their loss\n\nof enjoyment of life during the three years immediately after the\n\naccident, but  into the indefinite future.   See Gutierrez-Rodri-\n                                                                 \n\nguez, 882 F.2d at 580; Kokesh v.

Viewed in  the light most  favorable to  the\n\nverdicts, Fumero's testimony reasonably  enabled the jury to find\n\nthat none  of the plaintiffs had regained  normal emotional func-\n         \n\ntion by the time of trial and that though Havinga, Stach, and Van\n\nder Ark may  continue to  improve, it is  uncertain whether  they\n\n                    \n\n60); Paschedag (85 to 55).   Dr. Fumero described a GAF of 65  as\n\"very, very low.\"  Crowley argues that the amounts awarded to the\nindividual plaintiffs  were disproportionate to  their respective\nGAFs.   Dr. Fumero explained,  however, that it  is misleading to\ncompare  GAFs  between individuals.   The  GAF compares  an indi-\nvidual's current emotional function to his pre-accident capacity.\nMoreover,  the jury  was entitled  to weigh  all the  evidence in\n                                                \nassessing the individual awards, not merely the GAFs. \n\n                                15\n\nwill ever  recover their  pre-accident levels of  emotional func-\n\ntion.

In this  case, the uncontroverted\n\nevidence  of severe  PTSD,  accompanied by  substantial pain  and\n\nsuffering  and loss of enjoyment of life brought on by diminished\n\nemotional function,  which may  well prove permanent,  takes this\n\ncase out of the Betancourt mode.16 \n                          \n\n          Finally,  Crowley  claims  these  awards   are  grossly\n\nexcessive compared  to awards  in other cases.   As  we have  ex-\n\nplained, \"the paramount focus in reviewing a damage award must be\n\nthe  evidence presented at trial  . . . .

This anomaly is  due, in  large part,  to the  presumed\nbrevity of  the  pain and  suffering experienced  before the  de-\ncedent's  demise, which is separate  and apart from  an award for\nwrongful  death.   Moreover,  as explained  above,  see supra  at\n                                                             \npp.14-15, the noneconomic  damages in this case  were not limited\nto \"pain and  suffering\" at and  immediately after the  accident,\nbut  included sustained  emotional injuries,  including PTSD  and\nplaintiffs' sustained  and/or permanent loss  of emotional  func-\ntion.  \n\n                                20\n\nfor past  medical expenses and lost earnings  are well documented\n\nin the record.  On the other hand, the individual awards for loss\n\nof personal effects (except for the Van der Ark award) exceed the\n\namounts to which  plaintiffs testified at trial:  Havinga ($5,500\n\nloss, awarded  $27,000); Stach ($17,600  loss, awarded  $32,400);\n\nHagemann ($5,600 loss,  awarded $9,400); Paschedag  ($7,000 loss,\n\nawarded $15,600).  As there was no other relevant evidence, these\n\nawards  must be pared.18   See Kolb,  694 F.2d at  871 (award for\n                                   \n\npurely  economic damages  is  excessive as  a  matter of  law  if\n\nunsupportable on  any rational view of the  evidence); Segal, 746\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 81 (same).\n\n          Therefore, absent  a remittitur,  we must remand  for a\n\nnew  trial on damages relating to loss  of personal effects.  See\n                                                                 \n\nAnthony, 17 F.3d at 495.  Since the trial record clearly disclos-\n       \n\nes the maximum amount of damages recoverable for loss of personal\n\neffects,  however, we  can  calculate  the remittitur  ourselves.\n\nId.; Kolb,  694 F.2d at  875 (as  defects in  award \"are  readily\n         \n\n                    \n\n     18Plaintiffs  argue that  a  chart attached  to their  brief\nsupports the awards.   The chart merely lists the  total economic\ndamages claimed by  each plaintiff, with  no hint  as to how  the\ntotal  figure was derived.  Plaintiffs concede that the chart was\nnot  admitted in evidence.   Thus, it  merely served as  a visual\naid.  See Jack B.  Weinstein &amp; Margaret A.

Finally,\nplaintiffs neither  point  to,  nor  have we  found,  any  record\nsupport for these awards for loss of personal effects, other than\nplaintiffs' testimony.  \n\n                                21\n\nidentified and  measured,\" remittitur  more appropriate  than new\n\ntrial).19   We therefore order a new  trial on damages claimed by\n\nplaintiffs Havinga,  Stach, Hagemann, and Paschedag  for the loss\n\nof  their personal  effects and  belongings, unless  these plain-\n\ntiffs, respectively, remit $21,500, $14,800, $3,800, and  $8,600,\n\nin which  event their judgments shall stand affirmed as modified.\n\nSee id.; 11 Charles A.

Crowley filed its notice of appeal on  December 11, 1992.\nOn December 31, plaintiffs asked the district court to extend the\ntime for filing  their cross-appeal, alleging  that they had  not\nbeen  properly served with the Crowley notice of appeal, and that\nno  party would  be prejudiced  by the  late filing.   By  margin\norder, the court granted the extension.  Fed.  R.

This admiralty action stems from a\n          CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\nnighttime collision  approximately four  miles off the  island of\n\nCulebra,  Puerto Rico, between the 65-foot  sailboat GLORIA and a\n\n262-foot  barge  under tow  by  the tugboat  BORINQUEN,  owned by\n\ndefendant-appellant  Crowley Towing and  Transportation Co., Inc.\n\nThe five plaintiffs,  the captain  and crew of  the GLORIA,  were\n\nforced  to  abandon her  moments  before the  collision  and were\n\nrescued several hours later. \n\n          Following a ten-day trial in the United States District\n\nCourt for the  District of  Puerto Rico, a  jury found  Crowley's\n\nnegligence the sole  cause of the collision,  and awarded damages\n\ntotalling $1,661,700.1   Judgment entered  on July 24, 1992.   On\n\nAugust 7,  plaintiffs filed  a motion  to amend  the  judgment to\n\nprovide for attorney fees,  prejudgment interest, and  extraordi-\n\nnary  costs.   As  the Rule  59(e)  motion was  not  served until\n\nAugust 11, it was  summarily denied.  See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 59(e).\n                                         \n\nMeanwhile, Crowley  had  renewed its  motion  for judgment  as  a\n\nmatter of law or for  new trial, which the district  court denied\n\non November 18.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b).   Crowley now appeals\n                    \n\nboth  the final  judgment and  the order  denying its  Rule 50(b)\n\nmotion  for new trial  or for judgment  as a matter of  law.  The\n\nplaintiffs  cross-appeal  from the  denial  of  their Rule  59(e)\n\nmotion to amend the judgment.  \n\n                    \n\n     1At  the end of  plaintiffs' case and again  at the close of\nthe  evidence, Crowley  unsuccessfully  moved for  judgment as  a\nmatter of law, see Fed.

As Hagemann soon realized,\n\nhowever, the  BORINQUEN instead  was assuming a  collision course\n\nwith the GLORIA,  so he attempted  to bring  the GLORIA to  star-\n\nboard.  Unable to steer the GLORIA clear of the BORINQUEN without\n\nmotor power,  Hagemann tried unsuccessfully to  start her engine.\n\nPaschedag frantically  attempted to signal the  BORINQUEN with an\n\nair horn and  a marine light, to no avail.   Hagemann then yelled\n\nfor  Captain Havinga  and the  two other  crew members,  who were\n\nasleep below.  Although Havinga quickly came on deck, by the time\n\nhe could take the  helm and attempt evasive maneuvers  the BORIN-\n\nQUEN was within 60 feet and coming on \"very fast.\"8  \n\n                    \n\n     8The parties stipulated that the BORINQUEN changed course at\n3:24 a.m.  There was testimony that this course change placed the\nGLORIA in extremis.  The helmsman of the BORINQUEN testified that\n                  \nthe course change took \"about five minutes,\" \"more or less.\"   At\nsome point between  3:24 and 3:30,  Hagemann recognized that  the\ntug  was  assuming  a collision  course,  placing  the  GLORIA in\n                                                                 \nextremis.  Thus,  as approximately one minute  passed between the\n        \nnarrow  miss by the  BORINQUEN and the first  impact with the tow\nbarge  (at 3:30), the jury  reasonably could have  found that the\nGLORIA  had no  more than  two to three  minutes within  which to\nattempt to avoid the collision.  \n\n                                11\n\n          The BORINQUEN  herself narrowly missed the  GLORIA.  As\n\nthe vessels passed, however, a 200-meter steel tow cable connect-\n\ning the BORINQUEN with  its 262-foot tow barge scraped  along the\n\ndeck of  the GLORIA, crushing objects  in its path.   As the huge\n\nbarge bore  down  on the  65-foot GLORIA,  plaintiffs could  only\n\nawait  the  impending  collision  in helpless  panic.9    Moments\n\nbefore the initial impact at 3:30 a.m., Havinga, fearing that the\n\nGLORIA would be dragged  under the barge, ordered the  crew over-\n\nboard.   Before the men could respond, however, they were knocked\n\noff  their feet  by the  force of  the first of  three collisions\n\nbetween the barge and  the GLORIA.  The GLORIA swayed  90 degrees\n\nto  the horizontal  several  times before  righting herself,  and\n\nrapidly  drifted away.   The  plaintiffs could  see  the helmsman\n\naboard the BORINQUEN as the  barge passed them in the water,  but\n\nwere unable to attract attention aboard the BORINQUEN.\n\n          Eventually  the  five plaintiffs  made  it  to a  small\n\nrubber dinghy which Stach  had managed to throw from  the GLORIA,\n\nher life  boat having been lost  in the collision.   Due to their\n\nconfusion and panic, as well as  the darkness and rough seas, the\n\ncrew  had great  difficulty reaching  the dinghy,  and Stach  and\n\nPaschedag nearly drowned.   The dinghy was large enough  for only\n\ntwo or three  persons, and  the five plaintiffs  were piled  two-\n\ndeep.   Havinga, Van der Ark, and Stach had lost all their cloth-\n\ning, and shared  the little  clothing worn by  Hagemann and  Pas-\n\n                    \n\n     9Approximately sixty seconds elapsed  between the passing of\nthe BORINQUEN  itself and  the GLORIA's initial  impact with  the\ntrailing barge.  See supra note 8.\n                          \n\n                                12\n\nchedag.   The men  shivered uncontrollably, their  situation made\n\nmore  miserable  by Havinga's  incontinence  and  the sea  swells\n\nwashing over the sides of the dinghy.\n\n          At trial,  each plaintiff testified to  his own experi-\n\nence  and  emotional  state,  including  shock,  hysteria, panic,\n\ndesperation, and fear of death.  All were concerned about sharks.\n\nDue  to his  merchant  marine experience,  Havinga realized  (and\n\nadvised  Hagemann) that  sharks often  follow  barges to  feed on\n\nscraps  lost overboard.  Their fears were reinforced when Van der\n\nArk and others  observed fins around and beneath the dinghy.  The\n\nmen  knew that  even  a glancing  contact  with a  shark's  rough\n\nexterior could puncture and sink the rubber dinghy.  At the first\n\nappearance of sharks, therefore,  further efforts at paddling the\n\ndinghy were abandoned.  While  awaiting rescue, on several  occa-\n\nsions plaintiffs  experienced elation upon seeing  an approaching\n\nvessel (one within 300 yards), only to have their hopes dashed as\n\neach  vessel passed in the darkness.  Approximately four and one-\n\nhalf hours  after the collision,  plaintiffs were rescued  by the\n\ntug FAJARDO.\n\n          The individual plaintiffs  testified to their  pain and\n\nsuffering  and loss of enjoyment of  life following the accident.\n\nDr. Jose Fumero,  plaintiffs' examining psychiatrist,  testified,\n\nwithout objection,  that the  plaintiffs all suffered  from acute\n\npost-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD),10 a direct  result of the\n\n                    \n\n     10Dr. Fumero testified that  PTSD is an acknowledged anxiety\ndisorder, see American Psychiatric Assoc., Diagnostic and Statis-\n                                                                 \ntical Manual of Mental  Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, 247-49\n                                                         \n\n                                13\n\naccident.  Dr. Fumero  described the emotional injuries sustained\n\nby  each plaintiff,  and  testified to  a  \"Global Assessment  of\n\nFunction\" (GAF)  for each  plaintiff, ranging from  zero (virtual\n\nvegetative state) to ninety (high function).11\n\n          The  district court  instructed  the jury  to  consider\n\nplaintiffs' pain and suffering, as well as any loss of \"enjoyment\n\nof life  experiences in  the past,  and which you  find from  the\n                                 \n\nevidence  that they  are reasonably  certain  to suffer  [i]n the\n\nfuture.\" (Emphasis  added).
