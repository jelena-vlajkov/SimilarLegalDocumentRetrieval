Co. v. Tompkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103012\"><a href=\"/opinion/103012/erie-r-co-v-tompkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 78 (1938)).  Puerto Rico adheres to an expanded version of the hoary \"Fireman's Rule,\" recast in modern times as the \"Professional Rescuer's Rule.\"  Under that rule, there is no tort liability when, as in this case, the risk created by the defendants' conduct is one that the plaintiff predictably encounters when he enters upon private property in the course of carrying out his professional duties as, say, a firefighter or police officer.  See Soto Rivera v. Tropigas de P.R., Inc., 117 D.P.R. 863, 867 (1986);  see also Ortiz Andujar v. E.L.A., 122 D.P.R. 817 (1988);   Alvarado v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 87-88 (D.P.R. 1992).  Appellant's case seems to fit squarely within the four corners of the Soto Rivera doctrine, as his injuries arose in the course of his employment, he received benefits (i.e. workers' compensation) for those injuries from the State Insurance Fund, and he assumed the risk of the conditions existing at the fire scene when he reported for duty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we recognize that appellant strives valiantly to distinguish his case from earlier precedents, largely on the ground that district attorneys, unlike, say, firefighters or police officers, are not usually, or even regularly, assigned to visit fire scenes, and are not customarily exposed to peculiar environmental hazards in performing their wonted duties.  But we must apply Puerto Rico law in this case, and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has given no indication that it will carve out any exception to the Soto Rivera doctrine, let alone honor the novel distinction that appellant seeks to draw.  That ends the matter:  we have repeatedly warned that a litigant who, like appellant, deliberately chooses \"to reject a state-court forum in favor of a federal forum ... is in a perilously poor position to grumble\" about the federal court's unwillingness to blaze new, uncharted state-law trails.

We may, perhaps, be unadventurous in our interpretation of Puerto Rico law, but a plaintiff who seeks out a federal venue in a diversity action should not anticipate greater daring.  Affirmed.
