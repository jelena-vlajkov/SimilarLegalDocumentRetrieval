The  district  court thought  the probation  officers'\r\n\nclaim took  too much license,  and rejected  it.  See  Blackie v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMaine,  888 F. Supp. 203 (D.  Me. 1995).  The plaintiffs appeal.1\r               \r\n\nWe affirm.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  subsidiary  facts  are  not  in  serious  dispute.\r\n\nBeginning in 1978,  collective bargaining agreements between  the\r\n\nState of  Maine and certain  state workers stipulated  that those\r\n\nemployees whose  positions demanded that  they work  non-standard\r\n\nhours, i.e., irregular schedules  exceeding forty hours per week,\r\n\ninstead  of, say,  regular 9:00-to-5:00  shifts, would  receive a\r\n\nsixteen percent premium  over and  above their base  pay (but  no\r\n\novertime compensation).  Probation  officers' jobs satisfied this\r\n\ndefinition  and  therefore  carried  an entitlement  to  the  pay\r\n\npremium.\r\n\n          In 1985, the United States Supreme Court handed down  a\r\n\nresipiscent decision in which  it confessed error, reversed prior\r\n\nprecedent, and held that the wage and hour provisions of the Fair\r\n\nLabor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.   201-219, applied to state\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The plaintiffs, appellants here, occupy  positions that are\r\nvariously  classified  as   \"Probation  Parole   Officer/Juvenile\r\nCaseworker\"  and  \"Probation Parole  Officer  II.\"   Because  the\r\ndistinction  between  these  positions makes  no  difference  for\r\npresent purposes, we refer to the plaintiffs simply as \"probation\r\nofficers.\"\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nemployers.  See Garcia  v. San Antonio Metro. Transit  Auth., 469\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 528, 555-57 (1985).  Maine promptly evaluated its work force\r\n\nto  determine which  state  jobs came  under the  FLSA's overtime\r\n\ncompensation provisions and which did not.  After concluding that\r\n\nmany  positions within  the  law enforcement  services bargaining\r\n\nunit of  the Maine State  Employees Association (the  Union) were\r\n\nFLSA-covered,  the State  negotiated  side  agreements  with  the\r\n\nholders  of those positions.   In general, these  pacts eased the\r\n\ntransition by  confirming the  affected workers'  eligibility for\r\n\novertime  compensation,  increasing  their  base salaries  by  an\r\n\naverage of four percent, and eliminating the sixteen percent non-\r\n\nstandard pay  premium.  The  State concluded,  however, that  the\r\n\nprobation officers fell within an FLSA exemption for professional\r\n\nemployees,  see 29  U.S.C.    213(a)(1), and  therefore permitted\r                         \r\n\nthem  to retain  their  wonted status.   Consequently,  probation\r\n\nofficers continued to  receive the pay  premium (but no  overtime\r\n\ncompensation).\r\n\n          In negotiations leading to the adoption of a collective\r\n\nbargaining  agreement (CBA) to take effect in 1986, the State and\r\n\nthe Union  locked horns over the  interplay between FLSA-mandated\r\n\novertime  compensation and  the  non-standard pay  premium.   The\r\n\nprobation officers set  out to secure  guaranteed payment of  the\r\n\npremium  for the life of the contract, regardless of their status\r\n\nunder  the  FLSA.   The State  balked.   Eventually,  the parties\r\n\nresolved  the impasse  by agreeing  to the  non-standard workweek\r\n\narticle reprinted in the appendix.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          Several years passed.   Then, on  December 18, 1992,  a\r\n\ncadre of probation officers sued the State seeking the shelter of\r\n\nthe  FLSA.  One  year and  three days  later, the  district court\r\n\nvindicated the probation officers' right to receive time-and-one-\r\n\nhalf overtime compensation under  the federal law.  See  Mills v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMaine, 839  F. Supp. 3, 4-5 (D. Me. 1993).  The State eschewed an\r               \r\n\nappeal.    Instead,  on January  3,  1994,  Nancy Kenniston,  the\r\n\ndirector of Maine's Bureau of Human Resources (BHR), notified all\r\n\nprobation officers  (including those who had  not participated in\r\n\nthe Mills litigation) that  they would no longer receive  the pay\r                   \r\n\npremium.  The  State reasoned that, under  the terms of the  non-\r\n\nstandard workweek article, job  classifications had to meet three\r\n\nenumerated criteria to qualify  for non-standard status; the lack\r\n\nof   FLSA  coverage   constituted  one   such   criterion;  Mills\r                                                                           \r\n\nestablished  juridically  that  the probation  officers  did  not\r\n\nfulfill this criterion, i.e., they did not occupy \"[p]ositions in\r\n\na  classification . . . exempt for overtime compensation from the\r\n\nFLSA\"; and, having lost  their non-standard status, the probation\r\n\nofficers had also lost their entitlement to the pay premium.\r\n\n          The Union countered this reclassification  by proposing\r\n\na  side agreement similar to those entered into between the State\r\n\nand certain other bargaining  units nearly a decade earlier.   On\r\n\nFebruary  2, 1994, Kenneth  Walo, director  of Maine's  Bureau of\r\n\nEmployee  Relations,  rejected  this  overture  because  the  CBA\r\n\nexpressly addressed the linkage  between FLSA coverage status and\r\n\nthe non-standard pay premium   a circumstance that did not obtain\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nwhen the State  negotiated the  earlier pacts    and because  the\r\n\nCBA's  \"zipper clause\" made it  pellucid that the  parties had no\r\n\nobligation  to renegotiate  matters  so addressed.2   Stymied  by\r\n\nthis turn of events, several probation officers sued a phalanx of\r\n\ndefendants  (collectively,  the  State)  under  the  FLSA's anti-\r\n\nretaliation  provision.3   They  charged,  inter  alia, that  the\r                                                                \r\n\nState's decision to eliminate  the pay premium while at  the same\r\n\ntime  abjuring  a side  agreement  constituted  acts of  reprisal\r\n\nprovoked by  the probation officers' successful  crusade for FLSA\r\n\novertime pay.  The State denied the allegations.\r\n\n          After the parties cross-moved for summary judgment, the\r\n\ndistrict court granted the  State's motion.   As to the lost  pay\r\n\npremium,  the court concluded that  the bargained language of the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The zipper clause states:\r\n\n               Each  party agrees  that  it  shall  not\r\n          attempt  to  compel  negotiations during  the\r\n          term of this agreement on  matters that could\r\n          have been raised during the negotiations that\r\n          preceded  this  agreement, matters  that were\r\n          raised during the negotiations  that preceded\r\n          this   agreement,   or   matters   that   are\r\n          specifically addressed in this agreement.\r\n\nMaine's Supreme Judicial Court has given  such clauses full force\r\nand effect.  See,  e.g., Bureau of Employee Relations  v. AFSCME,\r                                                                          \r\n614 A.2d 74, 77 (Me. 1992).\r\n\n     3The statute provides in part that no employer may\r\n\n          discharge or in any other manner discriminate\r\n          against  any  employee because  such employee\r\n          has  filed  any  complaint  or  instituted or\r\n          caused  to be instituted any proceeding under\r\n          or related to [the FLSA].\r\n\n29 U.S.C.   215(a)(3).\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nCBA, as opposed to any retaliatory animus, compelled the  result.\r\n\nSee  Blackie, 888 F. Supp. at 207.  As to the State's spurning of\r                      \r\n\na  side  agreement,  the court  held  that  this  rebuff did  not\r\n\nconstitute  an adverse employment action under the FLSA.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 208.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          The  district court's closely reasoned opinion mortally\r\n\nwounds the arguments that the appellants parade before us.  Thus,\r\n\nwe  affirm   the  judgment   largely  for  the   reasons  already\r\n\narticulated, adding only the finishing touches.\r\n\n          First:   The appellants labor  to convince us  that the\r                    First:\r                         \r\n\nparties'  disagreement  over  the  meaning  of  the  non-standard\r\n\nworkweek article forestalls the entry of summary judgment.  Their\r\n\nlabors are both unproductive and unpersuasive.\r\n\n          Of course, summary judgment  is appropriate only if the\r\n\nrecord reveals no genuine  issue of material fact and  the movant\r\n\ndemonstrates an entitlement to judgment as a matter of  law.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P.  56(c); see also McCarthy v.  Northwest Airlines,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc.,  56 F.3d  313,  315  (1st  Cir. 1995)  (collecting  cases);\r              \r\n\nNational Amusements, Inc.  v.

Under this\r                                   \r\n\nstandard,  \"a  party  seeking  summary  judgment  [must]  make  a\r\n\npreliminary  showing  that  no  genuine issue  of  material  fact\r\n\nexists.  Once  the movant  has made this  showing, the  nonmovant\r\n\nmust  contradict  the  showing  by  pointing  to  specific  facts\r\n\ndemonstrating  that  there  is,  indeed,  a  trialworthy  issue.\"\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nNational Amusements,  43 F.3d  at 735.   Nonetheless, genuineness\r                             \r\n\nand materiality are not infinitely elastic euphemisms that may be\r\n\nstretched to fit whatever pererrations catch a litigant's fancy.\r\n\n          In the lexicon  of Rule 56, \"genuine\" connotes that the\r\n\nevidence on the  point is  such that a  reasonable jury,  drawing\r\n\nfavorable inferences,  could resolve the fact in the manner urged\r\n\nby the nonmoving party, and \"material\"  connotes that a contested\r\n\nfact has the potential to alter the outcome of the suit under the\r\n\ngoverning   law  if   the   controversy  over   it  is   resolved\r\n\nsatisfactorily to the nonmovant.  See United States v.

Read as a\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nwhole,   the   article   can    sustain   only   one   reasonable\r\n\ninterpretation.     Section   1   provides   that  the   employee\r\n\nclassifications listed in  section 3  (e.g., probation  officers)\r\n\nmust  meet each of three  criteria (exemption from FLSA coverage,\r\n\nelongated workweek,  irregular work schedule) to  qualify as non-\r\n\nstandard positions.   Section  2 merely  makes  explicit what  is\r\n\nimplicit in  a combined reading of  the other two  sections:  the\r\n\nState's power to delete  an employment category from non-standard\r\n\nstatus once it appropriately determines that the employees within\r\n\nthat category are not exempt from  the FLSA.  The short of it  is\r\n\nthat,  under the  terms of  the article,  FLSA coverage  and non-\r\n\nstandard status  are mutually  exclusive.  Accordingly,  the FLSA\r\n\novertime  matrix and  the non-standard  pay premium  are mutually\r\n\nexclusive methods of remuneration.\r\n\n          The appellants challenge this seemingly straightforward\r\n\nconstruction by training their  sights single-mindedly on section\r\n\n3.  Doing enormous violence to context, they suggest that because\r\n\ncertain   job  classifications  enumerated   in  section   3  are\r\n\ndesignated therein  as \"meeting  the above criteria,\"  those jobs\r\n\nare frozen into  place (and,  thus, entitled to  receive the  pay\r\n\npremium)  for the duration of the CBA.  This infrigidated reading\r\n\nmelts under the most mild scrutiny.\r\n\n          It is  hornbook law that an  interpretation which gives\r\n\neffect to all  the terms of a contract is  preferable to one that\r\n\nharps  on isolated provisions, heedless of context.

On the third element\r\n\nthe appellants made a  much more tenuous showing:   they limned a\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nclose temporal  link   the change in  classification followed hot\r\n\non the heels  of the  Mills decision    and produced evidence  of\r                                     \r\n\nstatements  by certain officials to the  effect that the district\r\n\ncourt's  order in Mills led to the State's decision to reclassify\r                                 \r\n\nthe  probation officers  and revoke  their pay  premium.4   As we\r\n\nelucidate  below, this  evidence,  taken most  hospitably to  the\r\n\nappellants, fails to create  a genuine question of  material fact\r\n\nin respect to the third element of their cause of action.\r\n\n                                B\r                                          B\r\n\n          The  fundamental  flaw in  the appellants'  argument is\r\n\nthat it depends on applying a black-letter legal rule in a purely\r\n\nmechanical fashion,  divorced from considerations  of policy  and\r\n\nlogic.   They  begin, auspiciously  enough, with  the proposition\r\n\nthat  the  FLSA  prohibits  an employer  from  taking  an adverse\r\n\nemployment action because an employee participates in a protected\r\n\nactivity.   They  then observe  that the  State scrapped  the pay\r\n\npremium because of the Mills lawsuit.  On this basis, they assert\r                                      \r\n\nthat the  State violated the FLSA.  This  is a non sequitur:  one\r\n\nplus one does not equal three.\r\n\n          The appellants' argument assumes that the FLSA's ban on\r\n\nretaliating  against  an  employee  who engages  in  a  protected\r\n\nactivity is  the functional equivalent of  a straightjacket which\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The State  contends that  these  statements are  immaterial\r\nbecause none of them was attributable to the actual decisionmaker\r\n(Kenniston).   See, e.g.,  Medina-Munoz v. R.J.  Reynolds Tobacco\r                                                                           \r\nCo., 896  F.2d 5, 10  (1st Cir. 1990).   We need not  pursue this\r             \r\npoint  because even if the statements are probative of the matter\r\nasserted    an issue  on which we  express no opinion    they are\r\ninsufficient to turn the tide.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nrestrains  an  employer  from  responding  on  the  basis  of its\r\n\nbusiness judgment to  the outcome brought about  by the protected\r                                           \r\n\nactivity.   We disagree  with this assumption.   The  FLSA   like\r\n\nother anti-retaliation  laws    does not immobilize  employers in\r\n\nthis manner.   An employer  may reorganize its  affairs and  take\r\n\nother necessary  employment actions in order to manage the impact\r\n\nof compliance with the outcomes produced  by a protected activity\r\n\nso long  as it does so for legitimate reasons and not in reprisal\r\n\nfor the fact of an employee's participation.  See, e.g.,  York v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCity of Wichita  Falls, 48 F.3d 919, 920-21 (5th Cir. 1995) (York\r                                                                           \r\n\nII) (finding no retaliation under the FLSA when city restructured\r            \r\n\ncompensation  arrangements \"to  comply with  Garcia and  the FLSA\r                                                             \r\n\nwithin   existing  budgetary  constraints\");  Adams  v.

A\r                     \r\n\ncontrary  rule would  mummify  the  status  quo  and  prevent  an\r\n\nemployer from complying with a court  order in the manner that it\r\n\ndeems  most compatible with the lawful operation of its business.\r\n\nNothing in the FLSA even remotely suggests this grotesque result.\r\n\n          Recognizing  this  abecedarian principle  leads  to the\r\n\nfollowing  conclusion.   The anti-retaliation  provision mandates\r\n\nthat  an employer  must  put to  one  side an  employee's  lawful\r\n\nefforts to secure rights assured by the FLSA.  At  the same time,\r\n\nthe statute does not foreclose  the employer from exercising  its\r\n\nbusiness judgment  simply because doing so may affect an employee\r\n\nwho successfully asserted FLSA-protected rights.\r\n\n          The  other  side of  the coin,  of  course, is  that by\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nengaging  in a  protected activity an  employee does  not acquire\r\n\nimmunity  from  the  same  risks that  confront  virtually  every\r\n\nemployee every  day in every work  place.  The FLSA  is neither a\r\n\nshield  against  legitimate  employer  actions  nor  a  statutory\r\n\nguaranty  of undiluted compensation,  come what  may.   This case\r\n\naptly illustrates  the  point:    applying  the  anti-retaliation\r\n\nprovision  as  the appellants  ask  would bar  the  employer from\r\n\nenforcing  a valid  preagreed contractual  provision specifically\r\n\nnegotiated  to guard against the  very eventuality    a change in\r\n\nthe parties' status   that the appellants subsequently labored to\r\n\nachieve.  That is not the law.\r\n\n                                C\r                                          C\r\n\n          The appellants' thesis  suffers from another  infirmity\r\n\nas well.  The thesis necessarily depends on the existence of some\r\n\nevidence  that  the  statutorily protected  activity  (i.e.,  the\r\n\nappellants'  instigation  of,  and  participation  in  the  Mills\r                                                                           \r\n\nlitigation) furnished the motive driving the State's execution of\r\n\nthe    adverse   employment   action    (i.e.,   the   shift   in\r\n\nclassification).  We agree  with the lower court that  the record\r\n\ncontains no such evidence.\r\n\n          The CBA provides in  substance that probation  officers\r\n\nwill receive the non-standard pay premium as long as they remain,\r\n\namong  other  things,  exempt  from  coverage  under  the  FLSA's\r\n\novertime  pay  provisions.    Once  Mills  established  that  the\r                                                   \r\n\nprobation  officers were not so exempt, the CBA dictated that the\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nnon-standard pay  premium be  eliminated.5  The  State's decision\r\n\nto  abolish the  pay  premium applied  equally  to all  probation\r\n\nofficers,  regardless  of  whether  they  had  joined  the  Mills\r                                                                           \r\n\nplaintiffs.  What is  more, that decision  was  taken in response\r\n\nto the  Mills ruling only  in the  sense that the  State believed\r                       \r\n\nitself obligated to follow both the letter and the  spirit of the\r\n\nfederal court's  decree.  There is simply no basis for a reasoned\r\n\ninference that the State's reliance on  the CBA was a pretext for\r\n\nretaliation.\r\n\n          In  a nutshell,  then,  the State  plainly changed  the\r\n\nappellants'  classification  for   a  nondiscriminatory   reason,\r\n\nnamely,  to implement the terms  of a contract  that required the\r\n\nState  to eliminate  the pay  premiums to  match  the recipients'\r\n\nstatus  vis-a-vis the FLSA.   That the State's  action took place\r\n\nbecause  of a  judicial  declaration of  the appellants'  status,\r\n\nbrought  about by  the appellants'  suit, neither  transforms the\r\n\ncharacter of the action nor renders it per se  unlawful under the\r\n\nFLSA.   For  aught that appears,  the State would  have taken the\r\n\nsame action regardless of the presence or absence of  retaliatory\r\n\nanimus.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5The appellants argue  that the  letter of the  CBA did  not\r\nrequire the BHR to reclassify  their positions merely because the\r\nfederal district court had so ruled.  This amounts to little more\r\nthan  whistling past the graveyard.   Once the  federal court had\r\nspoken, state  officials were duty  bound to enforce  the State's\r\nrights under  the terms of the CBA in order to protect the public\r\nfisc   especially where, as here, the CBA expressly addressed the\r\nsituation.  And, moreover, the appellants had no  possible reason\r\nto  anticipate that the  State would refrain  from exercising its\r\nexplicitly reserved rights under the CBA.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n          Third:   Next, the  appellants bombard the  CBA itself.\r                    Third:\r                         \r\n\nThey  have lately come to the view  that a contract which permits\r\n\nthe  State to forgo the non-standard pay premium whenever a court\r\n\ndetermines  that a  class of  employees is  not exempt  from FLSA\r\n\ncoverage is an abomination, and thus unenforceable.\r\n\n          This  barrage is  fired from two  different directions.\r\n\nBoth volleys land well wide of the mark.\r\n\n                                A\r                                          A\r\n\n          The appellants asseverate that if  the terms of the CBA\r\n\nensure that  a successful  FLSA  suit inevitably  will result  in\r\n\nending the pay  premium, then  the CBA contains  a veiled  threat\r\n\nagainst  pursuing FLSA  rights and  is per  se retaliatory.   The\r\n\nasseveration lacks force.\r\n\n          The CBA leaves no room to doubt that the State bestowed\r\n\nthe non-standard pay premium on the probation officers in lieu of\r\n\novertime  compensation.6   It  simply is  not retaliatory  for an\r\n\nemployer  and an  employee to  agree  to alternative  methods for\r\n\ncompensating overtime work based  on the latter's coverage status\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Based  on actions taken by  the Mills court, the appellants\r                                                     \r\ncontend that  the sixteen percent  pay premium comprised  part of\r\ntheir  base wage rate.   This contention is  disingenuous.  While\r\nthe  Mills  court  included  the  pay  premium  in  the probation\r                    \r\nofficers' \"regular rate of pay,\" see Mills v. Maine, 853 F. Supp.\r                                                             \r\n551, 554 (D. Me. 1994),  it did so solely as part  of calculating\r\nthe  probation  officers' damages  under the  FLSA.   That damage\r\ncomputation has no bearing on the contractual question of whether\r\nthe parties intended the  premium to be a surrogate  for overtime\r\ncompensation.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nunder the  FLSA.7   See, e.g., Walling  v.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBarrentine  v.

This is an  old whine in a new  bottle.  As Judge\r\n\nHornby observed, see Blackie, 888 F. Supp. at 207, the appellants\r                                      \r\n\nenjoyed the full  panoply of rights secured to them  by the FLSA.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7The appellants bewail the fact that their take-home pay may\r\ndecrease under  the new format.   This herring  is very red.   If\r\nthere  is a decrease, the record contains nothing to suggest that\r\nit  will  be brought  about by  anything  other than  the State's\r\nefforts  to  contain  overtime.   Though  the  FLSA  requires  an\r\nemployer to pay a covered employee time-and-one-half for overtime\r\nwork, the employee has no  vested entitlement to such work.   See\r                                                                           \r\nAdams, 890 F.2d at  840; see also Joint Explanatory  Statement of\r                                           \r\nthe  Committee of the Conference,  H.R.

In any event,  the pivotal issue here is not the  degree of\r\nthe appellants'  alleged harm,  but whether the  State retaliated\r\nagainst them at all.\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nIndeed,  they  successfully prosecuted  their  action  and, as  a\r\n\nconsequence, stand to recover substantial damages.8\r\n\n          Fourth:  Shifting gears,  the appellants posit that the\r                    Fourth:\r                          \r\n\nState's  refusal   to  negotiate  a  side   agreement  with  them\r\n\ncomparable  to the pacts entered into between the State and other\r\n\nlaw  enforcement   bargaining  units   in  the  wake   of  Garcia\r                                                                           \r\n\nconstitutes an unlawful reprisal under the FLSA.  We think not.\r\n\n          In  a  retaliation  case,  as in  virtually  any  other\r\n\nemployment discrimination  case premised on  disparate treatment,\r\n\nit is essential  for the plaintiff to show that the employer took\r\n\na materially adverse  employment action against him.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nYork I, 944 F.2d at 239-41; Spring v. Sheboygan Area Sch.  Dist.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n865 F.2d 883, 885 (7th Cir. 1989).  Determining whether an action\r\n\nis   materially  adverse  necessarily   requires  a  case-by-case\r\n\ninquiry.  See Welsh v. Derwinski, 14 F.3d 85, 86 (1st Cir. 1994);\r                                          \r\n\nsee also 2  Lex K. Larson,  Employment Discrimination  34.04  (2d\r                  \r\n\ned.  1994).   Moreover,  the inquiry  must  be cast  in objective\r\n\nterms.  Work  places are  rarely idyllic retreats,  and the  mere\r\n\nfact  that  an employee  is displeased  by  an employer's  act or\r\n\nomission does  not elevate that act or omission to the level of a\r\n\nmaterially adverse employment action.\r\n\n          Withal, some degree of generalization can be attempted.\r\n\nTypically,  the  employer  must  either  (1)  take  something  of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8The appellants attempt to blunt this thrust by arguing that\r\nthe State will use the  savings from its elimination of the  non-\r\nstandard pay premium  to fund the  damage award.  This  is beside\r\nthe point.    How  the State  chooses  to spend  any  savings  it\r\nrealizes from eliminating the premium is the State's business.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nconsequence from  the employee,  say, by discharging  or demoting\r\n\nher,  reducing  her  salary,  or  divesting  her  of  significant\r\n\nresponsibilities, see Crady v. Liberty Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 993\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir. 1993); Connell, 924 F.2d at  1179, or (2)\r                                                \r\n\nwithhold  from the  employee  an accouterment  of the  employment\r\n\nrelationship, say, by failing  to follow a customary practice  of\r\n\nconsidering  her  for  promotion  after a  particular  period  of\r\n\nservice, see, e.g., Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 75-76\r                                                       \r\n\n(1984).    Thus,  the  first   employment  action  of  which  the\r\n\nappellants complain   altering  the probation officers' status in\r\n\na way that  rendered them ineligible for  the preexisting sixteen\r\n\npercent  pay premium    constituted  a materially  adverse taking\r\n\n(albeit not an actionable  one because it was not  retaliatory in\r\n\nnature).    But  the  second  employment  action   to  which  the\r\n\nappellants advert    the State's unwillingness,  in the aftermath\r\n\nof Mills, to negotiate a side agreement with them   does not rise\r                  \r\n\nto the level of a materially adverse action.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          The  appellants hinge  their claim  on the  notion that\r\n\npast practice  created an expectation that, when  the FLSA became\r\n\napplicable to a particular position,  the State would negotiate a\r\n\nside  agreement.  By refusing to follow this practice, the thesis\r\n\nruns,  the State deprived the appellants of their expectancy.  We\r\n\nagree that under certain circumstances an employer's inaction can\r\n\noperate  to deprive an employee of a privilege of employment that\r\n\nan employee had reason  to anticipate he would receive;  in those\r\n\nsituations, the  deprivation  constitutes an  adverse  employment\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\naction.  See, e.g., Hishon, 467 U.S. at 75-76; Petitti, 909  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 32.  But  trying to fit this case within the  contours of that\r\n\ndoctrine is like  trying to fit a square peg  snugly into a round\r\n\nhole.\r\n\n          Here, the presence of the non-standard workweek article\r\n\naccomplished  two things:    (1) it  relieved  the State  of  any\r\n\nobligation to  dicker in the event  of a change  in the probation\r\n\nofficers'  FLSA  status;  and   (2)  it  effectively  dashed  any\r\n\nrealistic  expectation  that the  State  would  negotiate a  side\r\n\nagreement in the  event of  a change in  FLSA status  (especially\r\n\nsince the  CBA's zipper  clause, see  supra note  2, specifically\r                                                     \r\n\nrelieves  both  parties  of  any  duty  to  renegotiate  contract\r\n\nprovisions in midstream).  Accordingly, the appellants' professed\r\n\nexpectancy is only wishful thinking.\r\n\n          If this  were not enough, the  historical parallel that\r\n\nthe appellants  draw is not a  parallel at all.   It conveniently\r\n\nignores  the fact that, when the State negotiated side agreements\r\n\nnearly a decade earlier, the  CBA then in effect did  not address\r\n\nthe interplay of FLSA overtime and the non-standard pay  premium.\r\n\nBy contrast,  the  contemporaneous  CBA  expressly  defines  this\r\n\nrelationship  and indicates  the  results that  will flow  from a\r\n\nchange  in  status.   To put  it  plainly, the  circumstances had\r\n\nchanged so  dramatically that the appellants  step into quicksand\r\n\nonce they march under the banner of past practice.\r\n\n          To say more would be to knight a monarch.  On the facts\r\n\nof this case, the State's decision to abjure a side agreement did\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nnot  constitute  an  adverse   employment  action.    It  follows\r\n\ninexorably, as night follows day, that the appellants have failed\r\n\nto validate this aspect of their claim.9\r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.     Having  agreed  to   the\r\n\nelimination of their pay premium if found to be eligible for FLSA\r\n\novertime compensation,  the appellants have no  right to complain\r\n\nthat, when they pressed, the State held them to their bargain.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9We have remarked, time and again, that irony is no stranger\r\nto the law.

When\r\nthe Mills plaintiffs first  sued, the State offered to  discuss a\r                   \r\nsettlement predicated on a side agreement, but the Union's lawyer\r\n(now counsel for the plaintiffs in this case) turned a deaf ear.\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\n                             APPENDIX\r                                       APPENDIX\r\n\n[Note:  This provision  is excerpted from the  1986-87 CBA.

BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  subsidiary  facts  are  not  in  serious  dispute.\r\n\nBeginning in 1978,  collective bargaining agreements between  the\r\n\nState of  Maine and certain  state workers stipulated  that those\r\n\nemployees whose  positions demanded that  they work  non-standard\r\n\nhours, i.e., irregular schedules  exceeding forty hours per week,\r\n\ninstead  of, say,  regular 9:00-to-5:00  shifts, would  receive a\r\n\nsixteen percent premium  over and  above their base  pay (but  no\r\n\novertime compensation).  Probation  officers' jobs satisfied this\r\n\ndefinition  and  therefore  carried  an entitlement  to  the  pay\r\n\npremium.\r\n\n          In 1985, the United States Supreme Court handed down  a\r\n\nresipiscent decision in which  it confessed error, reversed prior\r\n\nprecedent, and held that the wage and hour provisions of the Fair\r\n\nLabor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.   201-219, applied to state\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The plaintiffs, appellants here, occupy  positions that are\r\nvariously  classified  as   \"Probation  Parole   Officer/Juvenile\r\nCaseworker\"  and  \"Probation Parole  Officer  II.\"   Because  the\r\ndistinction  between  these  positions makes  no  difference  for\r\npresent purposes, we refer to the plaintiffs simply as \"probation\r\nofficers.\"\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nemployers.

Maine promptly evaluated its work force\r\n\nto  determine which  state  jobs came  under the  FLSA's overtime\r\n\ncompensation provisions and which did not.  After concluding that\r\n\nmany  positions within  the  law enforcement  services bargaining\r\n\nunit of  the Maine State  Employees Association (the  Union) were\r\n\nFLSA-covered,  the State  negotiated  side  agreements  with  the\r\n\nholders  of those positions.   In general, these  pacts eased the\r\n\ntransition by  confirming the  affected workers'  eligibility for\r\n\novertime  compensation,  increasing  their  base salaries  by  an\r\n\naverage of four percent, and eliminating the sixteen percent non-\r\n\nstandard pay  premium.  The  State concluded,  however, that  the\r\n\nprobation officers fell within an FLSA exemption for professional\r\n\nemployees,  see 29  U.S.C.    213(a)(1), and  therefore permitted\r                         \r\n\nthem  to retain  their  wonted status.   Consequently,  probation\r\n\nofficers continued to  receive the pay  premium (but no  overtime\r\n\ncompensation).\r\n\n          In negotiations leading to the adoption of a collective\r\n\nbargaining  agreement (CBA) to take effect in 1986, the State and\r\n\nthe Union  locked horns over the  interplay between FLSA-mandated\r\n\novertime  compensation and  the  non-standard pay  premium.   The\r\n\nprobation officers set  out to secure  guaranteed payment of  the\r\n\npremium  for the life of the contract, regardless of their status\r\n\nunder  the  FLSA.   The State  balked.   Eventually,  the parties\r\n\nresolved  the impasse  by agreeing  to the  non-standard workweek\r\n\narticle reprinted in the appendix.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          Several years passed.   Then, on  December 18, 1992,  a\r\n\ncadre of probation officers sued the State seeking the shelter of\r\n\nthe  FLSA.  One  year and  three days  later, the  district court\r\n\nvindicated the probation officers' right to receive time-and-one-\r\n\nhalf overtime compensation under  the federal law.  See  Mills v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMaine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444374\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444374/mills-v-state-of-me/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Instead,  on January  3,  1994,  Nancy Kenniston,  the\r\n\ndirector of Maine's Bureau of Human Resources (BHR), notified all\r\n\nprobation officers  (including those who had  not participated in\r\n\nthe Mills litigation) that  they would no longer receive  the pay\r                   \r\n\npremium.  The  State reasoned that, under  the terms of the  non-\r\n\nstandard workweek article, job  classifications had to meet three\r\n\nenumerated criteria to qualify  for non-standard status; the lack\r\n\nof   FLSA  coverage   constituted  one   such   criterion;  Mills\r                                                                           \r\n\nestablished  juridically  that  the probation  officers  did  not\r\n\nfulfill this criterion, i.e., they did not occupy \"[p]ositions in\r\n\na  classification . . . exempt for overtime compensation from the\r\n\nFLSA\"; and, having lost  their non-standard status, the probation\r\n\nofficers had also lost their entitlement to the pay premium.\r\n\n          The Union countered this reclassification  by proposing\r\n\na  side agreement similar to those entered into between the State\r\n\nand certain other bargaining  units nearly a decade earlier.   On\r\n\nFebruary  2, 1994, Kenneth  Walo, director  of Maine's  Bureau of\r\n\nEmployee  Relations,  rejected  this  overture  because  the  CBA\r\n\nexpressly addressed the linkage  between FLSA coverage status and\r\n\nthe non-standard pay premium   a circumstance that did not obtain\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nwhen the State  negotiated the  earlier pacts    and because  the\r\n\nCBA's  \"zipper clause\" made it  pellucid that the  parties had no\r\n\nobligation  to renegotiate  matters  so addressed.2   Stymied  by\r\n\nthis turn of events, several probation officers sued a phalanx of\r\n\ndefendants  (collectively,  the  State)  under  the  FLSA's anti-\r\n\nretaliation  provision.3   They  charged,  inter  alia, that  the\r                                                                \r\n\nState's decision to eliminate  the pay premium while at  the same\r\n\ntime  abjuring  a side  agreement  constituted  acts of  reprisal\r\n\nprovoked by  the probation officers' successful  crusade for FLSA\r\n\novertime pay.  The State denied the allegations.\r\n\n          After the parties cross-moved for summary judgment, the\r\n\ndistrict court granted the  State's motion.   As to the lost  pay\r\n\npremium,  the court concluded that  the bargained language of the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The zipper clause states:\r\n\n               Each  party agrees  that  it  shall  not\r\n          attempt  to  compel  negotiations during  the\r\n          term of this agreement on  matters that could\r\n          have been raised during the negotiations that\r\n          preceded  this  agreement, matters  that were\r\n          raised during the negotiations  that preceded\r\n          this   agreement,   or   matters   that   are\r\n          specifically addressed in this agreement.\r\n\nMaine's Supreme Judicial Court has given  such clauses full force\r\nand effect.

AFSCME,\r                                                                          \r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 (Me. 1992).\r\n\n     3The statute provides in part that no employer may\r\n\n          discharge or in any other manner discriminate\r\n          against  any  employee because  such employee\r\n          has  filed  any  complaint  or  instituted or\r\n          caused  to be instituted any proceeding under\r\n          or related to [the FLSA].\r\n\n29 U.S.C.   215(a)(3).\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nCBA, as opposed to any retaliatory animus, compelled the  result.\r\n\nSee  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1644765\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Blackie,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/1644765/blackie-v-state-of-me/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Read as a\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nwhole,   the   article   can    sustain   only   one   reasonable\r\n\ninterpretation.     Section   1   provides   that  the   employee\r\n\nclassifications listed in  section 3  (e.g., probation  officers)\r\n\nmust  meet each of three  criteria (exemption from FLSA coverage,\r\n\nelongated workweek,  irregular work schedule) to  qualify as non-\r\n\nstandard positions.   Section  2 merely  makes  explicit what  is\r\n\nimplicit in  a combined reading of  the other two  sections:  the\r\n\nState's power to delete  an employment category from non-standard\r\n\nstatus once it appropriately determines that the employees within\r\n\nthat category are not exempt from  the FLSA.  The short of it  is\r\n\nthat,  under the  terms of  the article,  FLSA coverage  and non-\r\n\nstandard status  are mutually  exclusive.  Accordingly,  the FLSA\r\n\novertime  matrix and  the non-standard  pay premium  are mutually\r\n\nexclusive methods of remuneration.\r\n\n          The appellants challenge this seemingly straightforward\r\n\nconstruction by training their  sights single-mindedly on section\r\n\n3.  Doing enormous violence to context, they suggest that because\r\n\ncertain   job  classifications  enumerated   in  section   3  are\r\n\ndesignated therein  as \"meeting  the above criteria,\"  those jobs\r\n\nare frozen into  place (and,  thus, entitled to  receive the  pay\r\n\npremium)  for the duration of the CBA.  This infrigidated reading\r\n\nmelts under the most mild scrutiny.\r\n\n          It is  hornbook law that an  interpretation which gives\r\n\neffect to all  the terms of a contract is  preferable to one that\r\n\nharps  on isolated provisions, heedless of context.

On the third element\r\n\nthe appellants made a  much more tenuous showing:   they limned a\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nclose temporal  link   the change in  classification followed hot\r\n\non the heels  of the  Mills decision    and produced evidence  of\r                                     \r\n\nstatements  by certain officials to the  effect that the district\r\n\ncourt's  order in Mills led to the State's decision to reclassify\r                                 \r\n\nthe  probation officers  and revoke  their pay  premium.4   As we\r\n\nelucidate  below, this  evidence,  taken most  hospitably to  the\r\n\nappellants, fails to create  a genuine question of  material fact\r\n\nin respect to the third element of their cause of action.\r\n\n                                B\r                                          B\r\n\n          The  fundamental  flaw in  the appellants'  argument is\r\n\nthat it depends on applying a black-letter legal rule in a purely\r\n\nmechanical fashion,  divorced from considerations  of policy  and\r\n\nlogic.   They  begin, auspiciously  enough, with  the proposition\r\n\nthat  the  FLSA  prohibits  an employer  from  taking  an adverse\r\n\nemployment action because an employee participates in a protected\r\n\nactivity.   They  then observe  that the  State scrapped  the pay\r\n\npremium because of the Mills lawsuit.  On this basis, they assert\r                                      \r\n\nthat the  State violated the FLSA.  This  is a non sequitur:  one\r\n\nplus one does not equal three.\r\n\n          The appellants' argument assumes that the FLSA's ban on\r\n\nretaliating  against  an  employee  who engages  in  a  protected\r\n\nactivity is  the functional equivalent of  a straightjacket which\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The State  contends that  these  statements are  immaterial\r\nbecause none of them was attributable to the actual decisionmaker\r\n(Kenniston).   See, e.g.,  Medina-Munoz v. R.J.  Reynolds Tobacco\r                                                                           \r\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536516\"><a href=\"/opinion/536516/52-fair-emplpraccas-253-52-empl-prac-dec-p-39659-jose-medina-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10  (1st Cir. 1990).   We need not  pursue this\r             \r\npoint  because even if the statements are probative of the matter\r\nasserted    an issue  on which we  express no opinion    they are\r\ninsufficient to turn the tide.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nrestrains  an  employer  from  responding  on  the  basis  of its\r\n\nbusiness judgment to  the outcome brought about  by the protected\r                                           \r\n\nactivity.   We disagree  with this assumption.   The  FLSA   like\r\n\nother anti-retaliation  laws    does not immobilize  employers in\r\n\nthis manner.   An employer  may reorganize its  affairs and  take\r\n\nother necessary  employment actions in order to manage the impact\r\n\nof compliance with the outcomes produced  by a protected activity\r\n\nso long  as it does so for legitimate reasons and not in reprisal\r\n\nfor the fact of an employee's participation.

A\r                     \r\n\ncontrary  rule would  mummify  the  status  quo  and  prevent  an\r\n\nemployer from complying with a court  order in the manner that it\r\n\ndeems  most compatible with the lawful operation of its business.\r\n\nNothing in the FLSA even remotely suggests this grotesque result.\r\n\n          Recognizing  this  abecedarian principle  leads  to the\r\n\nfollowing  conclusion.   The anti-retaliation  provision mandates\r\n\nthat  an employer  must  put to  one  side an  employee's  lawful\r\n\nefforts to secure rights assured by the FLSA.  At  the same time,\r\n\nthe statute does not foreclose  the employer from exercising  its\r\n\nbusiness judgment  simply because doing so may affect an employee\r\n\nwho successfully asserted FLSA-protected rights.\r\n\n          The  other  side of  the coin,  of  course, is  that by\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nengaging  in a  protected activity an  employee does  not acquire\r\n\nimmunity  from  the  same  risks that  confront  virtually  every\r\n\nemployee every  day in every work  place.  The FLSA  is neither a\r\n\nshield  against  legitimate  employer  actions  nor  a  statutory\r\n\nguaranty  of undiluted compensation,  come what  may.   This case\r\n\naptly illustrates  the  point:    applying  the  anti-retaliation\r\n\nprovision  as  the appellants  ask  would bar  the  employer from\r\n\nenforcing  a valid  preagreed contractual  provision specifically\r\n\nnegotiated  to guard against the  very eventuality    a change in\r\n\nthe parties' status   that the appellants subsequently labored to\r\n\nachieve.  That is not the law.\r\n\n                                C\r                                          C\r\n\n          The appellants' thesis  suffers from another  infirmity\r\n\nas well.  The thesis necessarily depends on the existence of some\r\n\nevidence  that  the  statutorily protected  activity  (i.e.,  the\r\n\nappellants'  instigation  of,  and  participation  in  the  Mills\r                                                                           \r\n\nlitigation) furnished the motive driving the State's execution of\r\n\nthe    adverse   employment   action    (i.e.,   the   shift   in\r\n\nclassification).  We agree  with the lower court that  the record\r\n\ncontains no such evidence.\r\n\n          The CBA provides in  substance that probation  officers\r\n\nwill receive the non-standard pay premium as long as they remain,\r\n\namong  other  things,  exempt  from  coverage  under  the  FLSA's\r\n\novertime  pay  provisions.    Once  Mills  established  that  the\r                                                   \r\n\nprobation  officers were not so exempt, the CBA dictated that the\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nnon-standard pay  premium be  eliminated.5  The  State's decision\r\n\nto  abolish the  pay  premium applied  equally  to all  probation\r\n\nofficers,  regardless  of  whether  they  had  joined  the  Mills\r                                                                           \r\n\nplaintiffs.  What is  more, that decision  was  taken in response\r\n\nto the  Mills ruling only  in the  sense that the  State believed\r                       \r\n\nitself obligated to follow both the letter and the  spirit of the\r\n\nfederal court's  decree.  There is simply no basis for a reasoned\r\n\ninference that the State's reliance on  the CBA was a pretext for\r\n\nretaliation.\r\n\n          In  a nutshell,  then,  the State  plainly changed  the\r\n\nappellants'  classification  for   a  nondiscriminatory   reason,\r\n\nnamely,  to implement the terms  of a contract  that required the\r\n\nState  to eliminate  the pay  premiums to  match  the recipients'\r\n\nstatus  vis-a-vis the FLSA.   That the State's  action took place\r\n\nbecause  of a  judicial  declaration of  the appellants'  status,\r\n\nbrought  about by  the appellants'  suit, neither  transforms the\r\n\ncharacter of the action nor renders it per se  unlawful under the\r\n\nFLSA.   For  aught that appears,  the State would  have taken the\r\n\nsame action regardless of the presence or absence of  retaliatory\r\n\nanimus.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5The appellants argue  that the  letter of the  CBA did  not\r\nrequire the BHR to reclassify  their positions merely because the\r\nfederal district court had so ruled.  This amounts to little more\r\nthan  whistling past the graveyard.   Once the  federal court had\r\nspoken, state  officials were duty  bound to enforce  the State's\r\nrights under  the terms of the CBA in order to protect the public\r\nfisc   especially where, as here, the CBA expressly addressed the\r\nsituation.  And, moreover, the appellants had no  possible reason\r\nto  anticipate that the  State would refrain  from exercising its\r\nexplicitly reserved rights under the CBA.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n          Third:   Next, the  appellants bombard the  CBA itself.\r                    Third:\r                         \r\n\nThey  have lately come to the view  that a contract which permits\r\n\nthe  State to forgo the non-standard pay premium whenever a court\r\n\ndetermines  that a  class of  employees is  not exempt  from FLSA\r\n\ncoverage is an abomination, and thus unenforceable.\r\n\n          This  barrage is  fired from two  different directions.\r\n\nBoth volleys land well wide of the mark.\r\n\n                                A\r                                          A\r\n\n          The appellants asseverate that if  the terms of the CBA\r\n\nensure that  a successful  FLSA  suit inevitably  will result  in\r\n\nending the pay  premium, then  the CBA contains  a veiled  threat\r\n\nagainst  pursuing FLSA  rights and  is per  se retaliatory.   The\r\n\nasseveration lacks force.\r\n\n          The CBA leaves no room to doubt that the State bestowed\r\n\nthe non-standard pay premium on the probation officers in lieu of\r\n\novertime  compensation.6   It  simply is  not retaliatory  for an\r\n\nemployer  and an  employee to  agree  to alternative  methods for\r\n\ncompensating overtime work based  on the latter's coverage status\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Based  on actions taken by  the Mills court, the appellants\r                                                     \r\ncontend that  the sixteen percent  pay premium comprised  part of\r\ntheir  base wage rate.

Work  places are  rarely idyllic retreats,  and the  mere\r\n\nfact  that  an employee  is displeased  by  an employer's  act or\r\n\nomission does  not elevate that act or omission to the level of a\r\n\nmaterially adverse employment action.\r\n\n          Withal, some degree of generalization can be attempted.\r\n\nTypically,  the  employer  must  either  (1)  take  something  of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8The appellants attempt to blunt this thrust by arguing that\r\nthe State will use the  savings from its elimination of the  non-\r\nstandard pay premium  to fund the  damage award.  This  is beside\r\nthe point.    How  the State  chooses  to spend  any  savings  it\r\nrealizes from eliminating the premium is the State's business.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nconsequence from  the employee,  say, by discharging  or demoting\r\n\nher,  reducing  her  salary,  or  divesting  her  of  significant\r\n\nresponsibilities, see Crady v.

Thus,  the  first   employment  action  of  which  the\r\n\nappellants complain   altering  the probation officers' status in\r\n\na way that  rendered them ineligible for  the preexisting sixteen\r\n\npercent  pay premium    constituted  a materially  adverse taking\r\n\n(albeit not an actionable  one because it was not  retaliatory in\r\n\nnature).    But  the  second  employment  action   to  which  the\r\n\nappellants advert    the State's unwillingness,  in the aftermath\r\n\nof Mills, to negotiate a side agreement with them   does not rise\r                  \r\n\nto the level of a materially adverse action.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          The  appellants hinge  their claim  on the  notion that\r\n\npast practice  created an expectation that, when  the FLSA became\r\n\napplicable to a particular position,  the State would negotiate a\r\n\nside  agreement.  By refusing to follow this practice, the thesis\r\n\nruns,  the State deprived the appellants of their expectancy.  We\r\n\nagree that under certain circumstances an employer's inaction can\r\n\noperate  to deprive an employee of a privilege of employment that\r\n\nan employee had reason  to anticipate he would receive;  in those\r\n\nsituations, the  deprivation  constitutes an  adverse  employment\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\naction.

But  trying to fit this case within the  contours of that\r\n\ndoctrine is like  trying to fit a square peg  snugly into a round\r\n\nhole.\r\n\n          Here, the presence of the non-standard workweek article\r\n\naccomplished  two things:    (1) it  relieved  the State  of  any\r\n\nobligation to  dicker in the event  of a change  in the probation\r\n\nofficers'  FLSA  status;  and   (2)  it  effectively  dashed  any\r\n\nrealistic  expectation  that the  State  would  negotiate a  side\r\n\nagreement in the  event of  a change in  FLSA status  (especially\r\n\nsince the  CBA's zipper  clause, see  supra note  2, specifically\r                                                     \r\n\nrelieves  both  parties  of  any  duty  to  renegotiate  contract\r\n\nprovisions in midstream).  Accordingly, the appellants' professed\r\n\nexpectancy is only wishful thinking.\r\n\n          If this  were not enough, the  historical parallel that\r\n\nthe appellants  draw is not a  parallel at all.   It conveniently\r\n\nignores  the fact that, when the State negotiated side agreements\r\n\nnearly a decade earlier, the  CBA then in effect did  not address\r\n\nthe interplay of FLSA overtime and the non-standard pay  premium.\r\n\nBy contrast,  the  contemporaneous  CBA  expressly  defines  this\r\n\nrelationship  and indicates  the  results that  will flow  from a\r\n\nchange  in  status.   To put  it  plainly, the  circumstances had\r\n\nchanged so  dramatically that the appellants  step into quicksand\r\n\nonce they march under the banner of past practice.\r\n\n          To say more would be to knight a monarch.  On the facts\r\n\nof this case, the State's decision to abjure a side agreement did\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nnot  constitute  an  adverse   employment  action.    It  follows\r\n\ninexorably, as night follows day, that the appellants have failed\r\n\nto validate this aspect of their claim.9\r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.     Having  agreed  to   the\r\n\nelimination of their pay premium if found to be eligible for FLSA\r\n\novertime compensation,  the appellants have no  right to complain\r\n\nthat, when they pressed, the State held them to their bargain.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9We have remarked, time and again, that irony is no stranger\r\nto the law.

This  case provides yet another example.   When\r\nthe Mills plaintiffs first  sued, the State offered to  discuss a\r                   \r\nsettlement predicated on a side agreement, but the Union's lawyer\r\n(now counsel for the plaintiffs in this case) turned a deaf ear.\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\n                             APPENDIX\r                                       APPENDIX\r\n\n[Note:  This provision  is excerpted from the  1986-87 CBA.
