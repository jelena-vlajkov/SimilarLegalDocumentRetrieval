This is an\r                                                    \n\ninterlocutory appeal from a district court order granting a\n\npreliminary injunction, granting an attachment, and\n\nappointing a trustee pursuant to 12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(18) and\n\n(19).1\n\nI.   Background\r                           \n\n          Plaintiff is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\n(\"F.D.I.C.\"), suing in its capacity as liquidating agent for\n\ntwo banks, Boston Trade Bank and First Service Bank for\n\nSavings (\"First Service\").2  Defendants include Carmen Elio,\n\nhis wife Elaine Elio individually and in her capacity as\n\ntrustee, and their daughter Teresa Elio in her capacity as\n\ntrustee, as well as various entities with which the Elios are\n\ninvolved: the Elio Family Trust, the Seaview Realty Trust,\n\nFaneuil Hall Securities, Inc. (\"FH Securities\"), Faneuil Hall\n\nFinancial Services, Inc. (\"FH Financial Services\"), and\n\nFaneuil Hall Capital Group, Inc. (\"FH Capital Group\").\n\n          Central to this case are a number of promissory\n\nnotes executed by Carmen Elio on which he subsequently\n\ndefaulted, and transfers made by Carmen Elio which the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  We shall assume without deciding, the issue having\nneither been raised nor argued, that an interlocutory order\nappointing a trustee is appealable under 28 U.S.C.  \n1292(a)(2), which provides for appellate jurisdiction over\n\"[i]nterlocutory orders appointing receivers.\"\n\n2.  The F.D.I.C. was appointed liquidating agent of First\nService on March 31, 1989, and of Boston Trade Bank on May 3,\n1991.\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nF.D.I.C. alleges were made with intent to hinder, defraud or\n\ndelay his creditors.\n\n     A.   Promissory Notes\r                                      \n\n          In 1988, Carmen Elio borrowed the following sums\n\nfrom First Service: (1) $400,000 on April 19 by means of an\n\nunsecured promissory note with a term of three months; (2) $2\n\nmillion on May 4 by means of an unsecured promissory note\n\nwith a term of three years; and (3) $1,450,000 on September\n\n30 by means of a promissory note with a term of three years. \n\nElio defaulted on all three loans.\n\n          On July 1, 1991, Carmen Elio and FH Financial\n\nServices executed a note for $564,619.35 from the F.D.I.C.,\n\nwhich had been appointed liquidating agent of First Service\n\nin 1989.  The amount represented the outstanding balance on a\n\n1987 loan from First Service to Carmen and Elaine Elio,\n\nsecured by a mortgage on their home.  The F.D.I.C. canceled\n\nthe predecessor note and discharged the mortgage.  Under the\n\nnew loan agreement, Carmen Elio and FH Financial Services\n\nwere to make monthly payments of $7,065.38 beginning in\n\nAugust, 1991.  Elio defaulted on the monthly payments, and\n\nthe F.D.I.C. made a demand under the terms of the loan\n\nagreement.\n\n          By September 1991, Carmen Elio was also in default\n\non obligations to Boston Trade Bank, and, according to a\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nverified complaint filed in another action, to Chase\n\nManhattan Bank for $1,850,000.\n\n          B.   Transfers\r                                    \n\n          On October 25, 1990, Carmen Elio transferred his\n\ninterest in residential property in Florida to Elaine and\n\nTeresa Elio, as trustees of the Seaview Realty Trust, for no\n\nconsideration.  At the time the equity in the property was\n\nestimated to be more than $1 million.\n\n          On December 31, 1990, Carmen Elio created the Elio\n\nFamily Trust, naming Elaine Elio as trustee and his children\n\nas beneficiaries.  Upon creating the trust, Elio transferred\n\napproximately one-half of his interest in FH Securities to\n\nthe trust.  Two days later, on January 2, 1991, Elio\n\ntransferred the rest of his interest in FH Securities to the\n\ntrust.  Elio had valued his total interest in FH Securities\n\nat $843,000.\n\n          Also on January 2, 1991, Carmen Elio assigned his\n\ninterest, direct or indirect, in Advantage Health Care Corp.\n\nto the Family Trust.  On a financial statement dated July 15,\n\n1990, he had stated the value of his interest in Advantage at\n\n$3.84 million.3\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Financial statements signed by Carmen Elio in 1989 and\n1990 list a six percent interest in Advantage Health Corp.\nvalued at $3,840,000.  Elio contends that he never owned any\nstock in Advantage, but rather was one of two equal partners\nin H.R. Company, which purchased Advantage stock with money\nsupplied in part by Elio.  Elio claims that on January 2,\n1991, he assigned his interest in H.R. Company to the Elio\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          In September 1991, Carmen Elio transferred $218,867\n\nto Elaine Elio for no consideration.  The F.D.I.C. also\n\noffered evidence that the Elio Family Trust had paid Chase\n\nManhattan Bank $104,000 on Carmen Elio's obligations, and had\n\npaid $260,000 directly to Carmen Elio.\n\n     C.   Proceedings below\r                                       \n\n          The F.D.I.C. initiated a total of three actions\n\nagainst defendants.  In the first, commenced December 11,\n\n1991 (\"Elio I\"), the F.D.I.C., as liquidating agent of Boston\r                         \n\nTrade Bank, sought to recover from Carmen Elio and FH Capital\n\nGroup money owed under certain promissory notes and\n\nguaranties.  The district court granted the F.D.I.C.'s\n\nunopposed motion for summary judgment in Elio I and entered\r                                                           \n\nfinal judgment against Carmen Elio for $1,257,730.67 and\n\nagainst FH Capital Group for $59,582.43 on February 2, 1993.\n\n          In the second action, commenced August 27, 1993\n\n(\"Elio II\"), the F.D.I.C., as liquidating agent for First\r                     \n\nService, sued Carmen Elio and FH Financial Services on the\n\nthree 1988 promissory notes.  The F.D.I.C. later amended this\n\ncomplaint, adding a claim against Carmen Elio on the 1991\n\nnote, and adding fraudulent transfer claims against Elaine\n\nElio, both individually and as trustee of the Elio Family\n\nTrust and the Seaview Realty Trust, against Teresa Elio as\n\n                    \r                                \n\nFamily Trust, that H.R. Company was subsequently dissolved,\nand that a portion of the Advantage shares were transferred\nto a nominee for the trust.\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ntrustee of the Seaview Realty Trust, and against FH\n\nSecurities.\n\n          The third action, commenced December 9, 1993 (\"Elio\r                                                                         \n\nIII\"), is an action on the judgment in Elio I, asserting the\r                                                         \n\nsame fraudulent transfer claims as Elio II.\r                                                      \n\n          The F.D.I.C. moved in both Elio II and Elio III for\r                                                                     \n\n(1) a preliminary injunction against Carmen Elio and anyone\n\nacting on his behalf, (2) an attachment on the real property\n\nof Carmen and/or Elaine Elio, and (3) appointment of a\n\ntrustee to hold the assets of the Elio Family Trust and the\n\nSeaview Realty Trust.  The F.D.I.C. also moved to consolidate\n\nthe three cases.\n\n          After holding a hearing on December 21 and 23,\n\n1993, the district court found that the F.D.I.C. had already\n\nproven its right to recover approximately $1.3 million by\n\nvirtue of its judgment in Elio I, and was likely to achieve\r                                            \n\njudgment in excess of $4,780,000 in Elio II.  The court found\r                                                       \n\nthat the F.D.I.C. was reasonably likely to succeed in proving\n\nthat Carmen Elio had transferred assets to hinder, delay and\n\ndefraud the F.D.I.C.  The court also found that the balance\n\nof hardships weighed in favor of granting the equitable\n\nrelief sought by the F.D.I.C., and that the public interest\n\nwould be served by granting that relief.  The court granted a\n\npreliminary injunction against defendants and those acting in\n\nconcert with them; granted an attachment in the amount of $5\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nmillion against property held by Carmen and/or Elaine Elio in\n\nBarnstable County, Massachusetts; and appointed a trustee for\n\nthe Elio Family Trust and the Seaview Realty Trust.  The\n\ncourt allowed Carmen and Elaine Elio to pay their ordinary\n\npersonal expenses up to $5,000 per month, and allowed FH\n\nSecurities and FH Financial Services, with the trustee's\n\napproval, to make payments as reasonably necessary to\n\ncontinue to conduct business.\n\n          At a further hearing held on February 3, 1994 to\n\naddress additional issues relating to the court's order, the\n\ncourt extended the appointment of the trustee to FH Financial\n\nServices.\n\nII.  Analysis\r                         \n\n     A.   Appointment of the trustee\r                                                \n\n          Defendants argue that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion by appointing a trustee to hold the assets of the\n\nElio Family Trust, the Seaview Realty Trust and FH Financial\n\nServices.  In determining whether the district court abused\n\nits discretion, \"[a]n appellate court's role is to decide\n\nwhether the district court applied proper legal standards and\n\nwhether there was reasonable support for its evaluation of\n\nfactual questions.\"  Hochstadt v. Worcester Found. for\r                                                                  \n\nExperimental Biology, 545 F.2d 222, 229 (1st Cir. 1976).\r                                \n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          1.   Applicable standard\r                                              \n\n          Defendants' contend that the district court failed\n\nto apply the proper standard in appointing the trustee. \n\nParagraph (18) of 12 U.S.C.   1821(d), entitled \"Attachment\n\nof assets and other injunctive relief,\" provides:\n\n       Subject of [sic] paragraph (19), any court of\n     competent jurisdiction may, at the request of--\n\n            (A) the [Federal Deposit Insurance]\n          Corporation, (in the Corporation's capacity as\n          conservator or receiver for any insured\n          depository institution or in the Corporation's\n          corporate capacity with respect to any asset\n          acquired or liability assumed by the\n          Corporation under section 1821, 1822, or 1823\n          of this title); . . .\n\n          issue an order in accordance with Rule 65\n          of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n          including an order placing the assets of\n          any person designated by the Corporation\n          or such conservator under the control of\n          the court and appointing a trustee to\n          hold such assets.\n\nParagraph (19), entitled \"Standards,\" provides in relevant\n\npart:\n\n          (A) Showing\n          Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n          Procedure shall apply with respect to any\n          proceeding under paragraph (18) without\n          regard to the requirement of such rule\n          that the applicant show that the injury,\n          loss, or damage is irreparable and\n          immediate.\n\n          Defendants argue that, despite the statute's\n\nreferences to Rule 65, which governs injunctions, the\n\nappointment of a trustee to hold assets is governed by\n\nstricter standards and precedents applicable to the\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nappointment of receivers under Rule 66.  See Consolidated\r                                                                     \n\nRail Corp. v. Fore River Ry. Co., 861 F.2d 322, 326-27 (1st\r                                            \n\nCir. 1988) (reciting factors to be considered in appointment\n\nof receivers).  This is so, defendant argues, for three\n\nreasons: (1) there is no material difference between the\n\ntrustee authorized by   1821(d)(18) and a \"receiver\" as\n\ndescribed in Rule 66; (2) the provisions of 28 U.S.C.   959,\n\nwhich concern the responsibilities and liability of receivers\n\nand trustees, do not distinguish between the two; and (3) the\n\napparent intent of paragraphs (18) and (19) is to retain the\n\npre-existing legal standards applicable to such equitable\n\nrelief except for the requirement that the injury, loss or\n\ndamage be irreparable or immediate.  In making no mention of\n\nRule 66, defendant concludes, the \"drafters evidently\n\noverlooked the fact\" that receivers are governed by Rule 66,\n\nnot Rule 65.\n\n          We do not agree.  The fact that a trustee is\n\nanalogous to a receiver would not prevent Congress from\n\nauthorizing the appointment of a trustee upon a lesser\n\nshowing.  The statute could not be clearer in its repeated\n\ndesignation of Rule 65 as the source of the governing\n\nstandard.  \"[T]he task of interpretation begins with the text\n\nof the statute itself, and statutory language must be\n\naccorded its ordinary meaning.\"  Telematics Int'l, Inc. v.\r                                                                   \n\nNEMLC Leasing Corp., 967 F.2d 703, 706 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                               \n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Even looking at the statutory history, as courts\n\nhave sometimes done when interpreting otherwise clear\n\nstatutory language, id., that history only militates against\r                                   \n\ndefendant's argument.

Providing for the appointment of a trustee\n\nunder the standards of Rule 65 fits within this purpose. \n\nWhere a statute's plain language was consonant with its\n\napparent purpose, we have said that we would not find in it a\n\nmeaning \"nowhere suggested by the explicit language of the\n\nstatute itself.\"  Telematics, 967 F.2d at 706-07.\r                                        \n\n          We conclude that the appointment of a trustee under\n\n12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(18) is governed by the standards and\n\nprecedents applicable to the issuance of injunctive relief\n\nunder Rule 65, except that there is no need for plaintiff to\n\nshow that the injury, loss or damage will be irreparable or\n\nimmediate.

The transfers\n\nwere made in late 1990 and 1991.  The evidence indicated that\n\nby the end of 1990, Carmen Elio was more than $6 million in\n\ndebt, of which approximately $4.5 million was in default, and\n\nthat by September 1991 he was also in default on obligations\n\nto Boston Trade Bank.  There was evidence that these debts\n\nremained in default, with interest accruing, and that\n\njudgment subsequently entered for $1,257,730.67 on the\n\nF.D.I.C.'s action as liquidating agent of Boston Trade Bank. \n\nThe district court could thus reasonably have found\n\nunmanageable indebtedness on Elio's part at the time of the\n\ntransfers, and could reasonably have inferred that Elio would\n\nhave been aware that litigation would inevitably follow.\n\n          It is unquestioned that the transferees had a\n\nspecial relationship with Carmen Elio.  The two trusts were\n\nboth created by Elio; family members served as the trustees\n\nof both; his children were the beneficiaries of the Elio\n\nFamily Trust.6  Nor do defendants dispute that the transfers\n\nwere made for no consideration.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.  The record was silent as to the beneficiaries of the\nSeaview Realty Trust.\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n          The court supportably found that the transfers to\n\nthe trusts were not for legitimate tax planning purposes. \n\nMichael Davis, the tax attorney who had prepared the\n\ninstruments establishing the Elio Family Trust, testified\n\nthat, although he understood that the trust was being\n\nestablished for tax purposes and was aware of the initial\n\ntransfer of approximately half of the FH Securities stock to\n\nthe trust, Carmen Elio did not inform him of the transfer of\n\nthe remaining stock only two days later.  Davis also\n\ntestified that he was not consulted on or aware of any\n\nsubsequent transfers to the trust.  His testimony also\n\nindicated that the stock transfers far exceeded the amount\n\nthat would have been exempt under the gift tax annual\n\nexclusion.  Davis speculated that the additional amount could\n\nhave had other beneficial tax consequences, but conceded that\n\nthe financial information provided to him by Carmen Elio was\n\ninsufficient for him to know whether beneficial consequences\n\nwould occur.  Davis testified that he did not recall having\n\nseen Elio's 1989 or 1990 tax returns, was unaware to what\n\nextent Elio had made any prior gifts that would affect the\n\nlevel of his lifetime gift tax exemption, was not consulted\n\nwith respect to payment of any gift tax on the transfers to\n\nthe trust, and was unaware of Elio's transfer of property to\n\nthe Seaview Realty Trust.  The district court reasonably\n\nconcluded that although counsel formed the trust for\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nconventional gift tax purposes, Carmen Elio had not provided\n\ncounsel with full and accurate financial information and\n\nimmediately used the trust as a means to hinder, delay and\n\ndefraud his creditors.\n\n          The record supports the finding that Carmen Elio\n\ncontinued to enjoy the benefits of the property even after\n\nthe transfers were made.  There was evidence that the Elio\n\nFamily Trust made payments on Elio's obligation to Chase\n\nManhattan Bank, and that the trust paid $260,000 directly to\n\nElio;7 there was also evidence that, even after the Florida\n\nproperty was transferred to the Seaview Realty Trust, Elaine\n\nElio stated that the property was her \"winter residence,\"\n\nfrom which the court reasonably inferred that Carmen Elio had\n\nuse of the property as well.\n\n          The record supports the district court's finding\n\nthat Carmen Elio had in the past made false statements\n\nregarding his financial condition.  His financial statement\n\ngiven to Chase Manhattan Bank on December 31, 1989, did not\n\ndisclose his debt to Boston Trade Bank or the full amount of\n\nhis debt to First Service.  His financial statement given to\n\n                    \r                                \n\n7.  Monthly statements of the Elio Family Trust's account\nshow numerous other unexplained transactions, some in large\namounts.  After the trustee had been appointed and made its\ninitial report under seal to the court, the court noted on\nthe record that the report showed substantial payments made\nby the trust which did not appear to be for the benefit of\nthe beneficiaries, concluding that \"if the FDIC had known\nabout them, they would have emphatically used them in their\nearlier argument.\"\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nBoston Trade Bank on July 15, 1990 did not disclose any of\n\nthe debt then owed to First Service.  Nor, the district court\n\nreasonably inferred, had Elio told Attorney Davis of the\n\nextent of his substantial debt.\n\n          As to the proportion of Carmen Elio's property that\n\nhe had transferred, the district court reasonably found that\n\nElio's own statements on his previous financial statements\n\nwere not credible, and that there was no evidence of any\n\nproperty other than that which had been transferred.\n\n          Given the evidentiary support for these several\n\n\"badges of fraud,\" the district court reasonably concluded\n\nthat the F.D.I.C. was likely to succeed on the merits of its\n\nclaims against the two trusts.\n\n          The F.D.I.C. also sues FH Financial Services on its\n\nobligation under the $564,619.35 loan agreement executed July\n\n1, 1991.  There is sufficient evidence in the record to show\n\nthat FH Financial Services undertook this obligation and is\n\ncurrently in default on it.  Defendants do not claim\n\notherwise and offer no defense.  As a result, the district\n\ncourt was entitled to find that the F.D.I.C. would succeed on\n\nthe merits of its claim against FH Financial Services.\n\n          b.   Some showing of harm\r                                               \n\n          The record supports the district court's conclusion\n\nthat the F.D.I.C. would be harmed if no trustee were\n\nappointed    specifically, that the F.D.I.C.'s ability to\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nfulfill its statutory objective of collecting on the assets\n\nof the failed banks would be impaired.  There was evidence\n\nthat assets of the Elio Family Trust had been expended on\n\nCarmen Elio's behalf, and that Elio had continued to enjoy\n\nthe benefit of the assets transferred to the Seaview Realty\n\nTrust, thus permitting the inference that the assets of the\n\ntrusts were still within Elio's control.  The district court\n\nalso reasonably found that the F.D.I.C. had been frustrated\n\nin its attempts to obtain discovery with respect to the\n\nassets of the two trusts and of FH Financial Services,8 and\n\nwith respect to the merits.  The district court reasonably\n\nfound that the information previously provided by Carmen Elio\n\nhimself as to their assets was not credible.\n\n          At the hearing on February 3, 1994, the court heard\n\nrepresentations of counsel that FH Financial Services had\n\nonce been owned by Carmen Elio, that it may subsequently have\n\nbeen transferred to one of Elio's children, that its present\n\nownership was unknown, that its only known asset was a third\n\nmortgage on the Elios' home in Osterville, Massachusetts,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n8.  In response to Carmen Elio's statement in an affidavit\nthat the Florida property had been damaged in a hurricane and\nforeclosed upon, counsel for the F.D.I.C. stated, \"My\nquestion is:  Does the Seaview Realty Trust have other\nassets?  What happened when it was foreclosed?  Who\nforeclosed it?  What were the proceeds of the foreclosure? \nWas there an insurance policy payable?  Was the loss payee\nthe mortgagee if Hurricane Andrew damaged it?  There are a\nlot of questions about the Seaview Realty Trust which aren't\ndissolved by that terse statement that the property was\ndamaged by Hurricane Andrew and has been foreclosed.\"\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nthat the current state of its business was unknown, and that\n\nthe F.D.I.C. still sought discovery from it.  The court\n\nextended the appointment of the trustee to FH Financial\n\nServices to verify its assets and ensure its compliance with\n\nthe court's earlier order.  As there was a void of\n\ninformation concerning FH Financial Service's business,\n\nassets and ownership, the court could reasonably have found\n\nthat without the extension of the trustee to FH Financial\n\nServices, the F.D.I.C.'s ability to protect its rights and\n\npursue its claim would be impaired.\n\n          We hold that there is ample evidence of harm in the\n\nrecord to satisfy the reduced standard required by 12 U.S.C.\n\n  1821(d)(18) and (19).\n\n          c.   Balance of harms\r                                           \n\n          Finally, the record supports the district court's\n\nconclusion that the balance of harms weighed in the\n\nF.D.I.C.'s favor.  Defendants' contention that the\n\nappointment of a trustee would jeopardize the Elio Family\n\nTrust's license to sell securities was rejected by the\n\ndistrict court and is not pursued on appeal.  Defendants cite\n\nonly the costs of trusteeship itself and the deprivation of\n\nongoing control over their property as sources of harm. \n\nThough these harms are not negligible, the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in finding that they were outweighed\n\nby the potential harm to the F.D.I.C.'s ability to protect\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nthe assets of the failed banks.  Moreover, because the\n\nlikelihood of plaintiff's ultimate success on the merits is\n\ngreat, \"less weight is to be given to the defendant's\n\nprospective loss.\"  S.E.C. v. World Radio Mission, Inc., 544\r                                                                   \n\nF.2d 535, 541-42 (1st Cir. 1976).\n\n     B.   Preliminary injunction against Elaine Elio\r                                                                \n\n          The district court enjoined the defendants and\n\nthose acting in concert with them from \"selling,\n\ntransferring, hypothecating, encumbering or otherwise\n\nalienating any assets or property,\" specifically allowing\n\nCarmen and Elaine Elio individually to pay their ordinary\n\npersonal expenses up to $5,000 per month.  The district court\n\nemphasized that he had found Elaine Elio to be \"acting in\n\nconcert\" with Carmen Elio, that she would have been subject\n\nto the order even if not explicitly named, and that she was\n\nnamed in the order primarily to put her on notice and\n\n\"minimize the risk that someone would inadvertently do\n\nsomething that will make them the subject for a motion for\n\ncivil contempt by the F.D.I.C.\"\n\n          Defendants argue that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in granting a preliminary injunction against\n\nElaine Elio individually, because (1) there was no support\n\nfor a finding that she was acting in concert with Carmen\n\nElio, and (2) the amount of the injunction should have been\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nlimited to the amount of the allegedly fraudulent transfer\n\nthat she received from Carmen Elio.\n\n          But the evidence of Elaine Elio's involvement, was\n\nnot limited merely to her receipt of $218,867 from Carmen\n\nElio in September 1991.  Elaine Elio was the trustee of the\n\nElio Family Trust, which was the recipient of substantial\n\ntransfers from Carmen Elio on at least three occasions, and\n\nwhich subsequently made two transfers to Carmen Elio or on\n\nhis behalf.  She was also a trustee of the Seaview Realty\n\nTrust.  Seaview was the recipient of Florida residential\n\nproperty from Carmen Elio, which the court reasonably\n\ninferred could continue to be used by Carmen Elio after the\n\ntransfer.  In addition, Elaine Elio refused at her deposition\n\nto answer any questions about her involvement, asserting her\n\nFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  As\n\nthis is a civil action, the district court was entitled to\n\ndraw a negative inference from her refusal to testify. \n\nBaxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976).  We conclude\r                                \n\nthere was reasonable support in the record for the district\n\ncourt's finding that Elaine Elio was acting in concert with\n\nCarmen Elio in his attempts to hinder, delay and defraud his\n\ncreditors, and that a preliminary injunction was necessary to\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nprevent further dissipation of Elio's assets.9  See Fed. R.\r                                                               \n\nCiv. P. 65(d).\n\n          Nor was the scope of the injunction an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.  Despite the district court's repeated\n\ninvitation, Elaine Elio refused to provide information\n\nregarding the state and source of her assets, or to identify\n\nany assets which she had acquired independently from Carmen\n\nElio.  Defendants' assertion that Elaine Elio \"may very well\n\nhave\" independent assets was unsupported by any evidence. \n\nThe district court repeatedly offered to reconsider its order\n\nif such evidence were provided; none was.  From her refusal\n\nto testify regarding the source of her assets, and from the\n\nother evidence of her acting in concert with Carmen Elio to\n\ndefraud creditors, the court could have inferred a likelihood\n\nthat there had been additional transfers in unknown amounts. \n\nMoreover, to enjoin her, in the abstract, from dissipating\n\nonly those assets received from Carmen Elio would have been\n\nan ineffective directive subject to easy evasion, leaving the\n\ncourt with little ability to distinguish a valid expenditure\n\n                    \r                                \n\n9.  Defendants argue that the district court erroneously\nfound that Elaine Elio was Carmen Elio's \"alter ego,\" thereby\ninappropriately applying a principle of corporations to a\nrelationship between two individuals.  It is clear from the\nrecord, however, that the district court used the term \"alter\nego\" not as a term of art but rather as synonymous with\n\"acting in concert\"; the court used the latter phrase several\ntimes, including in the December 27, 1993 order.  Moreover,\nthe court specifically clarified this issue, citing to Rule\n65, on the record at the February 3, 1994 hearing.\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nfrom an invalid one.  Given the failure of defendants to\n\nprovide information on the basis of which the district court\n\nmight have meaningfully modified its order, it was not an\n\nabuse of discretion to enjoin Elaine Elio from spending more\n\nthan $5,000 per month.  See F.D.I.C. v. Faulkner, 991 F.2d\r                                                            \n\n262, 267 (5th Cir. 1993); F.S.L.I.C. v.

Echoing\n\ntheir arguments with respect to the preliminary injunction,\n\ndefendants argue that the attachment, as it applies to Elaine\n\nElio, was an abuse of discretion.\n\n          Unlike preliminary injunctions and receiverships,\n\nhowever, attachments are not among the interlocutory orders\n\nappealable under 28 U.S.C.   1292(a).  Defendants concede\n\nthat interlocutory orders granting attachments are not\n\nordinarily appealable, see In re Unanue Casal, 998 F.2d 28,\r                                                         \n\n31-32 (1st Cir. 1993); Lowell Fruit Co. v.

(\"F.D.I.C.\"), suing in its capacity as liquidating agent for two banks, Boston Trade Bank and First Service Bank for Savings (\"First Service\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Defendants include Carmen Elio, his wife Elaine Elio individually and in her capacity as trustee, and their daughter Teresa Elio in her capacity as trustee, as well as various entities with which the Elios are involved:  the Elio Family Trust, the Seaview Realty Trust, Faneuil Hall Securities, Inc.  (\"FH Securities\"), Faneuil Hall Financial Services, Inc.  (\"FH Financial Services\"), and Faneuil Hall Capital Group, Inc.  (\"FH Capital Group\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central to this case are a number of promissory notes executed by Carmen Elio on which he subsequently defaulted, and transfers made by Carmen Elio which the F.D.I.C. alleges were made with intent to hinder, defraud or delay his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Promissory Notes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, Carmen Elio borrowed the following sums from First Service:  (1) $400,000 on April 19 by means of an unsecured promissory note with a term of three months;  (2) $2 million on May 4 by means of an unsecured promissory note with a term of three years;  and (3) $1,450,000 on September 30 by means of a promissory note with a term of three years.  Elio defaulted on all three loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 1991, Carmen Elio and FH Financial Services executed a note for $564,619.35 from the F.D.I.C., which had been appointed liquidating agent of First Service in 1989.  The amount represented the outstanding balance on a 1987 loan from First Service to Carmen and Elaine Elio, secured by a mortgage on their home.  The F.D.I.C. canceled the predecessor note and discharged the mortgage.  Under the new loan agreement, Carmen Elio and FH Financial Services were to make monthly payments of $7,065.38 beginning in August, 1991.  Elio defaulted on the monthly payments, and the F.D.I.C. made a demand under the terms of the loan agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By September 1991, Carmen Elio was also in default on obligations to Boston Trade Bank, and, according to a verified complaint filed in another action, to Chase Manhattan Bank for $1,850,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Transfers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 25, 1990, Carmen Elio transferred his interest in residential property in Florida to Elaine and Teresa Elio, as trustees of the Seaview Realty Trust, for no consideration.  At the time the equity in the property was estimated to be more than $1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 31, 1990, Carmen Elio created the Elio Family Trust, naming Elaine Elio as trustee and his children as beneficiaries.  Upon creating the trust, Elio transferred approximately one-half of his interest in FH Securities to the trust.  Two days later, on January 2, 1991, Elio transferred the rest of his interest in FH Securities to the trust.  Elio had valued his total interest in FH Securities at $843,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on January 2, 1991, Carmen Elio assigned his interest, direct or indirect, in Advantage Health Care Corp. to the Family Trust.  On a financial statement dated July 15, 1990, he had stated the value of his interest in Advantage at $3.84 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1991, Carmen Elio transferred $218,867 to Elaine Elio for no consideration.  The F.D.I.C. also offered evidence that the Elio Family Trust had paid Chase Manhattan Bank $104,000 on Carmen Elio's obligations, and had paid $260,000 directly to Carmen Elio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Proceedings below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The F.D.I.C. initiated a total of three actions against defendants.  In the first, commenced December 11, 1991 (\"Elio I \"), the F.D.I.C., as liquidating agent of Boston Trade Bank, sought to recover from Carmen Elio and FH Capital Group money owed under certain promissory notes and guaranties.  The district court granted the F.D.I.C.'s unopposed motion for summary judgment in Elio I and entered final judgment against Carmen Elio for $1,257,730.67 and against FH Capital Group for $59,582.43 on February 2, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second action, commenced August 27, 1993 (\"Elio II \"), the F.D.I.C., as liquidating agent for First Service, sued Carmen Elio and FH Financial Services on the three 1988 promissory notes.  The F.D.I.C. later amended this complaint, adding a claim against Carmen Elio on the 1991 note, and adding fraudulent transfer claims against Elaine Elio, both individually and as trustee of the Elio Family Trust and the Seaview Realty Trust, against Teresa Elio as trustee of the Seaview Realty Trust, and against FH Securities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third action, commenced December 9, 1993 (\"Elio III \"), is an action on the judgment in Elio I, asserting the same fraudulent transfer claims as Elio II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The F.D.I.C. moved in both Elio II and Elio III for (1) a preliminary injunction against Carmen Elio and anyone acting on his behalf, (2) an attachment on the real property of Carmen and/or Elaine Elio, and (3) appointment of a trustee to hold the assets of the Elio Family Trust and the Seaview Realty Trust.  The F.D.I.C. also moved to consolidate the three cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding a hearing on December 21 and 23, 1993, the district court found that the F.D.I.C. had already proven its right to recover approximately $1.3 million by virtue of its judgment in Elio I, and was likely to achieve judgment in excess of $4,780,000 in Elio II.   The court found that the F.D.I.C. was reasonably likely to succeed in proving that Carmen Elio had transferred assets to hinder, delay and defraud the F.D.I.C.  The court also found that the balance of hardships weighed in favor of granting the equitable relief sought by the F.D.I.C., and that the public interest would be served by granting that relief.  The court granted a preliminary injunction against defendants and those acting in concert with them;  granted an attachment in the amount of $5 million against property held by Carmen and/or Elaine Elio in Barnstable County, Massachusetts;  and appointed a trustee for the Elio Family Trust and the Seaview Realty Trust.  The court allowed Carmen and Elaine Elio to pay their ordinary personal expenses up to $5,000 per month, and allowed FH Securities and FH Financial Services, with the trustee's approval, to make payments as reasonably necessary to continue to conduct business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a further hearing held on February 3, 1994 to address additional issues relating to the court's order, the court extended the appointment of the trustee to FH Financial Services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Appointment of the trustee</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion by appointing a trustee to hold the assets of the Elio Family Trust, the Seaview Realty Trust and FH Financial Services.  In determining whether the district court abused its discretion, \"[a]n appellate court's role is to decide whether the district court applied proper legal standards and whether there was reasonable support for its evaluation of factual questions.\"  Hochstadt v.

See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Fore River Ry. Co., 861 F.2d 322, 326-27 (1st Cir.1988) (reciting factors to be considered in appointment of receivers).  This is so, defendant argues, for three reasons:  (1) there is no material difference between the trustee authorized by Sec. 1821(d)(18) and a \"receiver\" as described in Rule 66;  (2) the provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 959, which concern the responsibilities and liability of receivers and trustees, do not distinguish between the two;  and (3) the apparent intent of paragraphs (18) and (19) is to retain the pre-existing legal standards applicable to such equitable relief except for the requirement that the injury, loss or damage be irreparable or immediate.  In making no mention of Rule 66, defendant concludes, the \"drafters evidently overlooked the fact\" that receivers are governed by Rule 66, not Rule 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree.  The fact that a trustee is analogous to a receiver would not prevent Congress from authorizing the appointment of a trustee upon a lesser showing.  The statute could not be clearer in its repeated designation of Rule 65 as the source of the governing standard.  \"[T]he task of interpretation begins with the text of the statute itself, and statutory language must be accorded its ordinary meaning.\"  Telematics Int'l, Inc. v.

Congress has given the FDIC a green light to use aggressive tactics in protecting taxpayers' interests.\"  F.D.I.C. v. Cafritz, 762 F.Supp. 1503, 1509 (D.D.C.1991).

Providing for the appointment of a trustee under the standards of Rule 65 fits within this purpose.

Sec. 1821(d)(18) is governed by the standards and precedents applicable to the issuance of injunctive relief under Rule 65, except that there is no need for plaintiff to show that the injury, loss or damage will be irreparable or immediate.  To justify the appointment of a trustee to hold the assets of defendants, the F.D.I.C. was, therefore, required to show (1) that it will suffer some injury in the absence of the appointment of a trustee;  (2) that such injury outweighs any harm which appointment of the trustee would inflict on the defendant;  (3) that the F.D.I.C. has exhibited a likelihood of success on the merits;  and (4) that the public interest will not be adversely affected by the appointment of the trustee.

Sec. 1821(d)(17).  To succeed on such claims, the F.D.I.C. must show that the transfer was made by the debtor of the financial institution within five years of the F.D.I.C.'s appointment as conservator or receiver, and that that debtor \"voluntarily or involuntarily made such transfer or incurred such liability with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the insured depository institution, the Corporation or other conservator, or any other appropriate Federal banking agency.\"  12 U.S.C.

The transfers were made in late 1990 and 1991.  The evidence indicated that by the end of 1990, Carmen Elio was more than $6 million in debt, of which approximately $4.5 million was in default, and that by September 1991 he was also in default on obligations to Boston Trade Bank.  There was evidence that these debts remained in default, with interest accruing, and that judgment subsequently entered for $1,257,730.67 on the F.D.I.C.'s action as liquidating agent of Boston Trade Bank.  The district court could thus reasonably have found unmanageable indebtedness on Elio's part at the time of the transfers, and could reasonably have inferred that Elio would have been aware that litigation would inevitably follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unquestioned that the transferees had a special relationship with Carmen Elio.  The two trusts were both created by Elio;  family members served as the trustees of both;  his children were the beneficiaries of the Elio Family Trust.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Nor do defendants dispute that the transfers were made for no consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court supportably found that the transfers to the trusts were not for legitimate tax planning purposes.  Michael Davis, the tax attorney who had prepared the instruments establishing the Elio Family Trust, testified that, although he understood that the trust was being established for tax purposes and was aware of the initial transfer of approximately half of the FH Securities stock to the trust, Carmen Elio did not inform him of the transfer of the remaining stock only two days later.  Davis also testified that he was not consulted on or aware of any subsequent transfers to the trust.  His testimony also indicated that the stock transfers far exceeded the amount that would have been exempt under the gift tax annual exclusion.  Davis speculated that the additional amount could have had other beneficial tax consequences, but conceded that the financial information provided to him by Carmen Elio was insufficient for him to know whether beneficial consequences would occur.  Davis testified that he did not recall having seen Elio's 1989 or 1990 tax returns, was unaware to what extent Elio had made any prior gifts that would affect the level of his lifetime gift tax exemption, was not consulted with respect to payment of any gift tax on the transfers to the trust, and was unaware of Elio's transfer of property to the Seaview Realty Trust.  The district court reasonably concluded that although counsel formed the trust for conventional gift tax purposes, Carmen Elio had not provided counsel with full and accurate financial information and immediately used the trust as a means to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the finding that Carmen Elio continued to enjoy the benefits of the property even after the transfers were made.  There was evidence that the Elio Family Trust made payments on Elio's obligation to Chase Manhattan Bank, and that the trust paid $260,000 directly to Elio;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  there was also evidence that, even after the Florida property was transferred to the Seaview Realty Trust, Elaine Elio stated that the property was her \"winter residence,\" from which the court reasonably inferred that Carmen Elio had use of the property as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the district court's finding that Carmen Elio had in the past made false statements regarding his financial condition.  His financial statement given to Chase Manhattan Bank on December 31, 1989, did not disclose his debt to Boston Trade Bank or the full amount of his debt to First Service.  His financial statement given to Boston Trade Bank on July 15, 1990 did not disclose any of the debt then owed to First Service.  Nor, the district court reasonably inferred, had Elio told Attorney Davis of the extent of his substantial debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the proportion of Carmen Elio's property that he had transferred, the district court reasonably found that Elio's own statements on his previous financial statements were not credible, and that there was no evidence of any property other than that which had been transferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the evidentiary support for these several \"badges of fraud,\" the district court reasonably concluded that the F.D.I.C. was likely to succeed on the merits of its claims against the two trusts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The F.D.I.C. also sues FH Financial Services on its obligation under the $564,619.35 loan agreement executed July 1, 1991.  There is sufficient evidence in the record to show that FH Financial Services undertook this obligation and is currently in default on it.  Defendants do not claim otherwise and offer no defense.  As a result, the district court was entitled to find that the F.D.I.C. would succeed on the merits of its claim against FH Financial Services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>b. Some showing of harm</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the district court's conclusion that the F.D.I.C. would be harmed if no trustee were appointed--specifically, that the F.D.I.C.'s ability to fulfill its statutory objective of collecting on the assets of the failed banks would be impaired.  There was evidence that assets of the Elio Family Trust had been expended on Carmen Elio's behalf, and that Elio had continued to enjoy the benefit of the assets transferred to the Seaview Realty Trust, thus permitting the inference that the assets of the trusts were still within Elio's control.  The district court also reasonably found that the F.D.I.C. had been frustrated in its attempts to obtain discovery with respect to the assets of the two trusts and of FH Financial Services,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and with respect to the merits.  The district court reasonably found that the information previously provided by Carmen Elio himself as to their assets was not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing on February 3, 1994, the court heard representations of counsel that FH Financial Services had once been owned by Carmen Elio, that it may subsequently have been transferred to one of Elio's children, that its present ownership was unknown, that its only known asset was a third mortgage on the Elios' home in Osterville, Massachusetts, that the current state of its business was unknown, and that the F.D.I.C. still sought discovery from it.  The court extended the appointment of the trustee to FH Financial Services to verify its assets and ensure its compliance with the court's earlier order.  As there was a void of information concerning FH Financial Service's business, assets and ownership, the court could reasonably have found that without the extension of the trustee to FH Financial Services, the F.D.I.C.'s ability to protect its rights and pursue its claim would be impaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that there is ample evidence of harm in the record to satisfy the reduced standard required by 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1821(d)(18) and (19).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>c. Balance of harms</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the record supports the district court's conclusion that the balance of harms weighed in the F.D.I.C.'s favor.  Defendants' contention that the appointment of a trustee would jeopardize the Elio Family Trust's license to sell securities was rejected by the district court and is not pursued on appeal.  Defendants cite only the costs of trusteeship itself and the deprivation of ongoing control over their property as sources of harm.  Though these harms are not negligible, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that they were outweighed by the potential harm to the F.D.I.C.'s ability to protect the assets of the failed banks.  Moreover, because the likelihood of plaintiff's ultimate success on the merits is great, \"less weight is to be given to the defendant's prospective loss.\"  S.E.C. v. World Radio Mission, Inc., 544 F.2d 535, 541-42 (1st Cir.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Preliminary injunction against Elaine Elio</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court enjoined the defendants and those acting in concert with them from \"selling, transferring, hypothecating, encumbering or otherwise alienating any assets or property,\" specifically allowing Carmen and Elaine Elio individually to pay their ordinary personal expenses up to $5,000 per month.  The district court emphasized that he had found Elaine Elio to be \"acting in concert\" with Carmen Elio, that she would have been subject to the order even if not explicitly named, and that she was named in the order primarily to put her on notice and \"minimize the risk that someone would inadvertently do something that will make them the subject for a motion for civil contempt by the F.D.I.C.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction against Elaine Elio individually, because (1) there was no support for a finding that she was acting in concert with Carmen Elio, and (2) the amount of the injunction should have been limited to the amount of the allegedly fraudulent transfer that she received from Carmen Elio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the evidence of Elaine Elio's involvement, was not limited merely to her receipt of $218,867 from Carmen Elio in September 1991.  Elaine Elio was the trustee of the Elio Family Trust, which was the recipient of substantial transfers from Carmen Elio on at least three occasions, and which subsequently made two transfers to Carmen Elio or on his behalf.  She was also a trustee of the Seaview Realty Trust.  Seaview was the recipient of Florida residential property from Carmen Elio, which the court reasonably inferred could continue to be used by Carmen Elio after the transfer.  In addition, Elaine Elio refused at her deposition to answer any questions about her involvement, asserting her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  As this is a civil action, the district court was entitled to draw a negative inference from her refusal to testify.  Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 1557, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976).  We conclude there was reasonable support in the record for the district court's finding that Elaine Elio was acting in concert with Carmen Elio in his attempts to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, and that a preliminary injunction was necessary to prevent further dissipation of Elio's assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was the scope of the injunction an abuse of discretion.  Despite the district court's repeated invitation, Elaine Elio refused to provide information regarding the state and source of her assets, or to identify any assets which she had acquired independently from Carmen Elio.  Defendants' assertion that Elaine Elio \"may very well have\" independent assets was unsupported by any evidence.  The district court repeatedly offered to reconsider its order if such evidence were provided;  none was.  From her refusal to testify regarding the source of her assets, and from the other evidence of her acting in concert with Carmen Elio to defraud creditors, the court could have inferred a likelihood that there had been additional transfers in unknown amounts.  Moreover, to enjoin her, in the abstract, from dissipating only those assets received from Carmen Elio would have been an ineffective directive subject to easy evasion, leaving the court with little ability to distinguish a valid expenditure from an invalid one.  Given the failure of defendants to provide information on the basis of which the district court might have meaningfully modified its order, it was not an abuse of discretion to enjoin Elaine Elio from spending more than $5,000 per month.  See F.D.I.C. v. Faulkner, 991 F.2d 262, 267 (5th Cir.1993);  F.S.L.I.C. v. Dixon, 835 F.2d 554, 566 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Attachment on Elaine Elio's property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered an attachment in the amount of $5 million on the real property of Carmen and/or Elaine Elio in Barnstable County, Massachusetts.  Echoing their arguments with respect to the preliminary injunction, defendants argue that the attachment, as it applies to Elaine Elio, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike preliminary injunctions and receiverships, however, attachments are not among the interlocutory orders appealable under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a).  Defendants concede that interlocutory orders granting attachments are not ordinarily appealable, see In re Unanue Casal, 998 F.2d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir.1993);  Lowell Fruit Co. v. Alexander's Market, Inc., 842 F.2d 567, 568-70 (1st Cir.1988), but briefly argue that the rule should not apply here because the attachment is integrally related to the other orders, is based on the same findings of fact, and will not waste judicial resources.  Defendants cite no statute or precedent in support of this argument, nor do defendants attempt to show that the attachment is appealable under the collateral order doctrine.  See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>.

It is clear from the record, however, that the district court used the term \"alter ego\" not as a term of art but rather as synonymous with \"acting in concert\";  the court used the latter phrase several times, including in the December 27, 1993 order.  Moreover, the court specifically clarified this issue, citing to Rule 65, on the record at the February 3, 1994 hearing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> We question whether such a showing could be made.

Co. v. Omni Video Games, Inc., 668 F.2d 70, 71 (1st Cir.1981).  Here, the validity of the attachment order is by no means separable from the merits of the F.D.I.C.'s fraudulent conveyance claims, and it \"may well involve only a fact-specific exercise of discretion rather than a controlling issue of law.\"  Bridge Constr.  Corp. v. City of Berlin, 705 F.2d 582, 583 (1st Cir.1983).  In addition, given that the attachment of Carmen Elio's interest in this same property was not challenged, it appears unlikely that Elaine Elio will suffer any irreparable harm from the attachment on her interest</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 1821(d)(18) and (19).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  (\"F.D.I.C.\"), suing in its capacity as liquidating agent for two banks, Boston Trade Bank and First Service Bank for Savings (\"First Service\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Defendants include Carmen Elio, his wife Elaine Elio individually and in her capacity as trustee, and their daughter Teresa Elio in her capacity as trustee, as well as various entities with which the Elios are involved:  the Elio Family Trust, the Seaview Realty Trust, Faneuil Hall Securities, Inc.  (\"FH Securities\"), Faneuil Hall Financial Services, Inc.  (\"FH Financial Services\"), and Faneuil Hall Capital Group, Inc.  (\"FH Capital Group\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central to this case are a number of promissory notes executed by Carmen Elio on which he subsequently defaulted, and transfers made by Carmen Elio which the F.D.I.C. alleges were made with intent to hinder, defraud or delay his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Promissory Notes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, Carmen Elio borrowed the following sums from First Service:  (1) $400,000 on April 19 by means of an unsecured promissory note with a term of three months;  (2) $2 million on May 4 by means of an unsecured promissory note with a term of three years;  and (3) $1,450,000 on September 30 by means of a promissory note with a term of three years.  Elio defaulted on all three loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 1991, Carmen Elio and FH Financial Services executed a note for $564,619.35 from the F.D.I.C., which had been appointed liquidating agent of First Service in 1989.  The amount represented the outstanding balance on a 1987 loan from First Service to Carmen and Elaine Elio, secured by a mortgage on their home.  The F.D.I.C. canceled the predecessor note and discharged the mortgage.  Under the new loan agreement, Carmen Elio and FH Financial Services were to make monthly payments of $7,065.38 beginning in August, 1991.  Elio defaulted on the monthly payments, and the F.D.I.C. made a demand under the terms of the loan agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By September 1991, Carmen Elio was also in default on obligations to Boston Trade Bank, and, according to a verified complaint filed in another action, to Chase Manhattan Bank for $1,850,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Transfers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 25, 1990, Carmen Elio transferred his interest in residential property in Florida to Elaine and Teresa Elio, as trustees of the Seaview Realty Trust, for no consideration.  At the time the equity in the property was estimated to be more than $1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 31, 1990, Carmen Elio created the Elio Family Trust, naming Elaine Elio as trustee and his children as beneficiaries.  Upon creating the trust, Elio transferred approximately one-half of his interest in FH Securities to the trust.  Two days later, on January 2, 1991, Elio transferred the rest of his interest in FH Securities to the trust.  Elio had valued his total interest in FH Securities at $843,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on January 2, 1991, Carmen Elio assigned his interest, direct or indirect, in Advantage Health Care Corp. to the Family Trust.  On a financial statement dated July 15, 1990, he had stated the value of his interest in Advantage at $3.84 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1991, Carmen Elio transferred $218,867 to Elaine Elio for no consideration.  The F.D.I.C. also offered evidence that the Elio Family Trust had paid Chase Manhattan Bank $104,000 on Carmen Elio's obligations, and had paid $260,000 directly to Carmen Elio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Proceedings below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The F.D.I.C. initiated a total of three actions against defendants.  In the first, commenced December 11, 1991 (\"Elio I \"), the F.D.I.C., as liquidating agent of Boston Trade Bank, sought to recover from Carmen Elio and FH Capital Group money owed under certain promissory notes and guaranties.  The district court granted the F.D.I.C.'s unopposed motion for summary judgment in Elio I and entered final judgment against Carmen Elio for $1,257,730.67 and against FH Capital Group for $59,582.43 on February 2, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second action, commenced August 27, 1993 (\"Elio II \"), the F.D.I.C., as liquidating agent for First Service, sued Carmen Elio and FH Financial Services on the three 1988 promissory notes.  The F.D.I.C. later amended this complaint, adding a claim against Carmen Elio on the 1991 note, and adding fraudulent transfer claims against Elaine Elio, both individually and as trustee of the Elio Family Trust and the Seaview Realty Trust, against Teresa Elio as trustee of the Seaview Realty Trust, and against FH Securities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third action, commenced December 9, 1993 (\"Elio III \"), is an action on the judgment in Elio I, asserting the same fraudulent transfer claims as Elio II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The F.D.I.C. moved in both Elio II and Elio III for (1) a preliminary injunction against Carmen Elio and anyone acting on his behalf, (2) an attachment on the real property of Carmen and/or Elaine Elio, and (3) appointment of a trustee to hold the assets of the Elio Family Trust and the Seaview Realty Trust.  The F.D.I.C. also moved to consolidate the three cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding a hearing on December 21 and 23, 1993, the district court found that the F.D.I.C. had already proven its right to recover approximately $1.3 million by virtue of its judgment in Elio I, and was likely to achieve judgment in excess of $4,780,000 in Elio II.   The court found that the F.D.I.C. was reasonably likely to succeed in proving that Carmen Elio had transferred assets to hinder, delay and defraud the F.D.I.C.  The court also found that the balance of hardships weighed in favor of granting the equitable relief sought by the F.D.I.C., and that the public interest would be served by granting that relief.  The court granted a preliminary injunction against defendants and those acting in concert with them;  granted an attachment in the amount of $5 million against property held by Carmen and/or Elaine Elio in Barnstable County, Massachusetts;  and appointed a trustee for the Elio Family Trust and the Seaview Realty Trust.  The court allowed Carmen and Elaine Elio to pay their ordinary personal expenses up to $5,000 per month, and allowed FH Securities and FH Financial Services, with the trustee's approval, to make payments as reasonably necessary to continue to conduct business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a further hearing held on February 3, 1994 to address additional issues relating to the court's order, the court extended the appointment of the trustee to FH Financial Services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Appointment of the trustee</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion by appointing a trustee to hold the assets of the Elio Family Trust, the Seaview Realty Trust and FH Financial Services.  In determining whether the district court abused its discretion, \"[a]n appellate court's role is to decide whether the district court applied proper legal standards and whether there was reasonable support for its evaluation of factual questions.\"  Hochstadt v.

See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Fore River Ry. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514211\"><a href=\"/opinion/514211/consolidated-rail-corporation-v-fore-river-railway-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span>, 326-27 (1st Cir.1988) (reciting factors to be considered in appointment of receivers).  This is so, defendant argues, for three reasons:  (1) there is no material difference between the trustee authorized by Sec. 1821(d)(18) and a \"receiver\" as described in Rule 66;  (2) the provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 959, which concern the responsibilities and liability of receivers and trustees, do not distinguish between the two;  and (3) the apparent intent of paragraphs (18) and (19) is to retain the pre-existing legal standards applicable to such equitable relief except for the requirement that the injury, loss or damage be irreparable or immediate.  In making no mention of Rule 66, defendant concludes, the \"drafters evidently overlooked the fact\" that receivers are governed by Rule 66, not Rule 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree.  The fact that a trustee is analogous to a receiver would not prevent Congress from authorizing the appointment of a trustee upon a lesser showing.  The statute could not be clearer in its repeated designation of Rule 65 as the source of the governing standard.  \"[T]he task of interpretation begins with the text of the statute itself, and statutory language must be accorded its ordinary meaning.\"  Telematics Int'l, Inc. v.

To justify the appointment of a trustee to hold the assets of defendants, the F.D.I.C. was, therefore, required to show (1) that it will suffer some injury in the absence of the appointment of a trustee;  (2) that such injury outweighs any harm which appointment of the trustee would inflict on the defendant;  (3) that the F.D.I.C. has exhibited a likelihood of success on the merits;  and (4) that the public interest will not be adversely affected by the appointment of the trustee.

The transfers were made in late 1990 and 1991.  The evidence indicated that by the end of 1990, Carmen Elio was more than $6 million in debt, of which approximately $4.5 million was in default, and that by September 1991 he was also in default on obligations to Boston Trade Bank.  There was evidence that these debts remained in default, with interest accruing, and that judgment subsequently entered for $1,257,730.67 on the F.D.I.C.'s action as liquidating agent of Boston Trade Bank.  The district court could thus reasonably have found unmanageable indebtedness on Elio's part at the time of the transfers, and could reasonably have inferred that Elio would have been aware that litigation would inevitably follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unquestioned that the transferees had a special relationship with Carmen Elio.  The two trusts were both created by Elio;  family members served as the trustees of both;  his children were the beneficiaries of the Elio Family Trust.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Nor do defendants dispute that the transfers were made for no consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court supportably found that the transfers to the trusts were not for legitimate tax planning purposes.  Michael Davis, the tax attorney who had prepared the instruments establishing the Elio Family Trust, testified that, although he understood that the trust was being established for tax purposes and was aware of the initial transfer of approximately half of the FH Securities stock to the trust, Carmen Elio did not inform him of the transfer of the remaining stock only two days later.  Davis also testified that he was not consulted on or aware of any subsequent transfers to the trust.  His testimony also indicated that the stock transfers far exceeded the amount that would have been exempt under the gift tax annual exclusion.  Davis speculated that the additional amount could have had other beneficial tax consequences, but conceded that the financial information provided to him by Carmen Elio was insufficient for him to know whether beneficial consequences would occur.  Davis testified that he did not recall having seen Elio's 1989 or 1990 tax returns, was unaware to what extent Elio had made any prior gifts that would affect the level of his lifetime gift tax exemption, was not consulted with respect to payment of any gift tax on the transfers to the trust, and was unaware of Elio's transfer of property to the Seaview Realty Trust.  The district court reasonably concluded that although counsel formed the trust for conventional gift tax purposes, Carmen Elio had not provided counsel with full and accurate financial information and immediately used the trust as a means to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the finding that Carmen Elio continued to enjoy the benefits of the property even after the transfers were made.  There was evidence that the Elio Family Trust made payments on Elio's obligation to Chase Manhattan Bank, and that the trust paid $260,000 directly to Elio;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  there was also evidence that, even after the Florida property was transferred to the Seaview Realty Trust, Elaine Elio stated that the property was her \"winter residence,\" from which the court reasonably inferred that Carmen Elio had use of the property as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the district court's finding that Carmen Elio had in the past made false statements regarding his financial condition.  His financial statement given to Chase Manhattan Bank on December 31, 1989, did not disclose his debt to Boston Trade Bank or the full amount of his debt to First Service.  His financial statement given to Boston Trade Bank on July 15, 1990 did not disclose any of the debt then owed to First Service.  Nor, the district court reasonably inferred, had Elio told Attorney Davis of the extent of his substantial debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the proportion of Carmen Elio's property that he had transferred, the district court reasonably found that Elio's own statements on his previous financial statements were not credible, and that there was no evidence of any property other than that which had been transferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the evidentiary support for these several \"badges of fraud,\" the district court reasonably concluded that the F.D.I.C. was likely to succeed on the merits of its claims against the two trusts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The F.D.I.C. also sues FH Financial Services on its obligation under the $564,619.35 loan agreement executed July 1, 1991.  There is sufficient evidence in the record to show that FH Financial Services undertook this obligation and is currently in default on it.  Defendants do not claim otherwise and offer no defense.  As a result, the district court was entitled to find that the F.D.I.C. would succeed on the merits of its claim against FH Financial Services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>b.

There was evidence that assets of the Elio Family Trust had been expended on Carmen Elio's behalf, and that Elio had continued to enjoy the benefit of the assets transferred to the Seaview Realty Trust, thus permitting the inference that the assets of the trusts were still within Elio's control.  The district court also reasonably found that the F.D.I.C. had been frustrated in its attempts to obtain discovery with respect to the assets of the two trusts and of FH Financial Services,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and with respect to the merits.  The district court reasonably found that the information previously provided by Carmen Elio himself as to their assets was not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing on February 3, 1994, the court heard representations of counsel that FH Financial Services had once been owned by Carmen Elio, that it may subsequently have been transferred to one of Elio's children, that its present ownership was unknown, that its only known asset was a third mortgage on the Elios' home in Osterville, Massachusetts, that the current state of its business was unknown, and that the F.D.I.C. still sought discovery from it.  The court extended the appointment of the trustee to FH Financial Services to verify its assets and ensure its compliance with the court's earlier order.  As there was a void of information concerning FH Financial Service's business, assets and ownership, the court could reasonably have found that without the extension of the trustee to FH Financial Services, the F.D.I.C.'s ability to protect its rights and pursue its claim would be impaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that there is ample evidence of harm in the record to satisfy the reduced standard required by 12 U.S.C.

Defendants' contention that the appointment of a trustee would jeopardize the Elio Family Trust's license to sell securities was rejected by the district court and is not pursued on appeal.  Defendants cite only the costs of trusteeship itself and the deprivation of ongoing control over their property as sources of harm.  Though these harms are not negligible, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that they were outweighed by the potential harm to the F.D.I.C.'s ability to protect the assets of the failed banks.  Moreover, because the likelihood of plaintiff's ultimate success on the merits is great, \"less weight is to be given to the defendant's prospective loss.\"  S.E.C. v.

Preliminary injunction against Elaine Elio</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court enjoined the defendants and those acting in concert with them from \"selling, transferring, hypothecating, encumbering or otherwise alienating any assets or property,\" specifically allowing Carmen and Elaine Elio individually to pay their ordinary personal expenses up to $5,000 per month.  The district court emphasized that he had found Elaine Elio to be \"acting in concert\" with Carmen Elio, that she would have been subject to the order even if not explicitly named, and that she was named in the order primarily to put her on notice and \"minimize the risk that someone would inadvertently do something that will make them the subject for a motion for civil contempt by the F.D.I.C.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction against Elaine Elio individually, because (1) there was no support for a finding that she was acting in concert with Carmen Elio, and (2) the amount of the injunction should have been limited to the amount of the allegedly fraudulent transfer that she received from Carmen Elio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the evidence of Elaine Elio's involvement, was not limited merely to her receipt of $218,867 from Carmen Elio in September 1991.  Elaine Elio was the trustee of the Elio Family Trust, which was the recipient of substantial transfers from Carmen Elio on at least three occasions, and which subsequently made two transfers to Carmen Elio or on his behalf.  She was also a trustee of the Seaview Realty Trust.  Seaview was the recipient of Florida residential property from Carmen Elio, which the court reasonably inferred could continue to be used by Carmen Elio after the transfer.  In addition, Elaine Elio refused at her deposition to answer any questions about her involvement, asserting her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  As this is a civil action, the district court was entitled to draw a negative inference from her refusal to testify.  Baxter v. Palmigiano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109429\"><a href=\"/opinion/109429/baxter-v-palmigiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 318, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109429\"><a href=\"/opinion/109429/baxter-v-palmigiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span> </a></span>(1976).  We conclude there was reasonable support in the record for the district court's finding that Elaine Elio was acting in concert with Carmen Elio in his attempts to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, and that a preliminary injunction was necessary to prevent further dissipation of Elio's assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was the scope of the injunction an abuse of discretion.  Despite the district court's repeated invitation, Elaine Elio refused to provide information regarding the state and source of her assets, or to identify any assets which she had acquired independently from Carmen Elio.  Defendants' assertion that Elaine Elio \"may very well have\" independent assets was unsupported by any evidence.  The district court repeatedly offered to reconsider its order if such evidence were provided;  none was.  From her refusal to testify regarding the source of her assets, and from the other evidence of her acting in concert with Carmen Elio to defraud creditors, the court could have inferred a likelihood that there had been additional transfers in unknown amounts.  Moreover, to enjoin her, in the abstract, from dissipating only those assets received from Carmen Elio would have been an ineffective directive subject to easy evasion, leaving the court with little ability to distinguish a valid expenditure from an invalid one.  Given the failure of defendants to provide information on the basis of which the district court might have meaningfully modified its order, it was not an abuse of discretion to enjoin Elaine Elio from spending more than $5,000 per month.
