Hunger, Assistant  Attorney General, and Robert Kendall,\n                                                                 \nJr., Assistant Director, were on brief for respondent.\n   \n\n                                           \n\n                                           \n\n          Per   Curiam.    Petitioner  Gilberto  Garc a  contests\n                      \n\ndecisions  of  the Board  of  Immigration  Appeals (the  \"Board\")\n\nordering deportation  and refusing  to reopen and  reconsider his\n\ncase.\n\n          Petitioner  is a  native and  citizen of  the Dominican\n\nRepublic.  He has been a lawful permanent resident  in the United\n\nStates  since  1979.   On August  19,  1988, the  Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\") commenced  deportation proceedings\n\nagainst  petitioner,  alleging  his deportability  under  section\n\n241(a)(11) of  the Immigration  and Nationality Act  (the \"Act\"),\n\n8 U.S.C.    1251(a)(11), as  an alien  convicted of  a controlled\n\nsubstance  violation  (cocaine).   At  a  deportation hearing  on\n\nFebruary 27,  1989,1 petitioner  conceded that he  was deportable\n\nas  charged and requested  an opportunity to  file an application\n\nfor a waiver of deportation under section 212(c) of the Act.  See\n                                                                 \n\n8 U.S.C.    1182(c).  The immigration judge assigned the case for\n\na hearing  on the merits  on June 26, and  directed petitioner to\n\nfile his  waiver application by June  16.  On  June 6, petitioner\n\nreceived  notice  that  his   hearing  had  been  rescheduled  to\n\nSeptember  27.  The notice did not mention the application filing\n\ndeadline.\n\n          On  September   14,  petitioner  filed  his      212(c)\n\napplication  by paying  the  application fee  at the  Providence,\n\nRhode Island office of the INS.  The application was delivered to\n\nthe Office of the  Immigration Judge in Boston,  Massachusetts on\n\n                    \n\n1  Unless otherwise specified, all dates are during 1989.\n\n                               -2-\n\nSeptember 15.\n\n          On   September  18,   the  immigration   judge  ordered\n\npetitioner's deportation because petitioner failed to timely file\n\nhis  written  application for  relief.   The  Board  affirmed the\n\ndecision and denied a subsequent motion to reopen.\n\n                                I\n\n          Petitioner asks that we  remand the case for  a hearing\n\non  the merits.   He asserts that  his attorney did  not file the\n\napplication  on  June 16  because  the  immigration judge  stated\n\nduring  the February  27 hearing that  the application  should be\n\nfiled ten days prior to  the hearing.  As a result,  his attorney\n\nallegedly met  the deadline  by sending the  application thirteen\n\ndays  prior  to the  postponed  hearing  date  of  September  28.\n\nBecause  the record clearly states that the application was to be\n\nfiled  by June 16,  petitioner's attorney contends that the judge\n\nmust have made  the statement on which he relies  off the record.\n\nMoreover, he  pleads that  the immigration judge  stated that  no\n\napplication  had  been  filed  when  he  ordered  deportation  on\n\nSeptember 18.   From this, petitioner's attorney  infers that the\n\nimmigration  judge also  believed  the relevant  filing date  was\n\nSeptember 18 and that the judge only ordered  deportation because\n\nhe had not received, through some error, the application filed on\n\nSeptember  14.     Petitioner   finally  urges  that   remand  is\n\nappropriate  because the  application was  filed late due  to the\n\nattorney's error  (not  petitioner's) and  because  no  prejudice\n\noccurred as a result of the tardy submission.\n\n                               -3-\n\n          Board  regulations  authorize an  immigration  judge to\n\n\"set  and extend time limits for the  filing of applications.\"  8\n\nC.F.R.    3.31(c)  (1993).   Applications  not  timely filed  are\n\ndeemed waived or abandoned.  Id.  The Board found,  and we agree,\n                                \n\nthat the record  clearly states  that the application  was to  be\n\nfiled by June 16.2   Since  the application was  not filed  until\n\nSeptember 14, the Board found the application waived and affirmed\n\nthe immigration judge's deportation order.  \n\n          Petitioner proposes no substantial argument against the\n\nBoard's decision.   Petitioner first emphasizes  that his counsel\n\nrecalls that the time  limit specified was ten days prior  to the\n\nhearing and that the immigration judge waited until  September 18\n\nto order deportation.  We cannot draw the inference he desires --\n\ni.e., that the immigration judge also thought the application due\n\nonly ten days before  the rescheduled hearing -- in  light of the\n\nplain  evidence  in the  record that  the  deadline was  June 16.\n\nPerhaps, for  example, the  immigration judge did  not issue  the\n\norder until September 18 because he reviewed his calendar on that\n\nday;  we can  only speculate, a  procedure contrary  to appellate\n\nreview.  Second, failure to comply with time limitations is often\n\nthe  fault of  counsel rather  than the  client, and  clients are\n\nbound  by the conduct of  their attorneys.  See Magallanes-Dami n\n                                                                 \n\nv. INS, 783  F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986).  Time limits would be\n      \n\n                    \n\n2  The immigration judge stated at the February 27 hearing:  \"I'd\nask that you  file that [application  for section 212(c)  relief]\nnot  later  than  June  16,  1989,  along  with   any  supporting\ndocuments.  And we'll be adjourned then to June 26 at 8:00 in the\nmorning.\"\n\n                               -4-\n\nmeaningless if we excused counsel's mistakes every time the error\n\nprejudiced  the client.   Finally,  while petitioner  contends no\n\nprejudice   has  occurred,   these  appellate   proceedings  have\n\nsubstantially  delayed  petitioner's   deportation  despite   his\n\neligibility  for  deportation  under    241(a)(11).    Since  the\n\nBoard's  factual finding  that  petitioner untimely  filed his   \n\n212(c) application  is supported  by substantial evidence  in the\n\nrecord, we affirm  its decision to affirm the  deportation order.\n\nSee Gouveia v. INS, 980 F.2d 814, 818 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[A] court\n                  \n\nmust accept the  Board's factual determinations  so long as  they\n\nare  supported  by substantial  evidence  .  . .  .\")  (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n                                II\n\n          The authority of the Board  or the Attorney General  to\n\nreopen   a   deportation   proceeding  \"derive[s]   solely   from\n\nregulations  promulgated  by  the  Attorney  General.\"    INS  v.\n                                                             \n\nDoherty,  112 S. Ct. 719,  724 (1992) (citing  INS v. R o-Pineda,\n                                                                \n\n471 U.S.  444, 446 (1985)).   A motion to reopen  or reconsider a\n\nfinal decision will not be granted unless petitioner presents new\n\nmaterial evidence previously  unavailable or identifies  a change\n\nin the  applicable statutory or case  law.  See 8  C.F.R.   3.2;3\n                                               \n\nMatter of Cerna, Int. Dec. 3161 (BIA Oct. 7, 1991).  As a general\n               \n\nmatter,  motions to reopen are  disfavored.  See  Doherty, 112 S.\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\n3  8 C.F.R.   3.2 specifies that \"[m]otions to reopen deportation\nproceedings shall not be  granted unless it appears to  the Board\nthat  evidence sought  to  be offered  is  material and  was  not\navailable  and could not have been discovered or presented at the\nformer hearing.\"  Id.\n                     \n\n                               -5-\n\nCt.  at  724.   The  decision  whether  to  reopen a  deportation\n\nproceeding lies within the Board's discretion.  See id.; Williams\n                                                                 \n\nv. INS, 773 F.2d 8, 9 (1st Cir. 1985).  In the past we  have held\n      \n\nthat \"'[t]he denial [of a motion to reopen] will be upheld unless\n\nit was made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed\n\nfrom established  policies, or  rested on an  impermissible basis\n\nsuch  as invidious  discrimination against  a particular  race or\n\ngroup.'\"   Williams, 773 F.2d at  9 (quoting Leblanc v.  INS, 715\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  685, 693 (1st Cir.  1983)).  This  standard is particularly\n\nappropriate where  waiver of  deportation  under    212(c) is  in\n\nissue  because whether  waiver is  granted is  firmly within  the\n\nBoard's discretion  and  depends  on  a balance  of  \"social  and\n\nhumane\" factors.  See Gouveia, 980 F.2d at 816.\n                             \n\n          Under  the above  standard,  the  Board's  decision  is\n\nunassailable.  The only new evidence that petitioner offered is a\n\ndetailed affidavit from his attorney concerning the circumstances\n\nof  his misunderstanding.4   As the Board  explained, however, it\n\nconsidered counsel's error and found  that even if the proceeding\n\nwere reopened, the attorney's affidavit was not likely to  change\n\nits  finding  that the  waiver  application  had been  abandoned.\n\nPetitioner has not cited any change in the applicable law.\n\n          We therefore affirm the decisions of the Board.\n\n                    \n\n4   Incidentally,  appellant  points out  that  the INS  has  not\nopposed reopening the case  and hearing the merits of  the 212(c)\napplication.    We fail  to  see why  the  Board must  sanction a\nviolation  of an immigration  judge's order because  the INS does\nnot specifically oppose reopening the case.\n\n                               -6-\n",

He has been a lawful permanent resident  in the United\n\nStates  since  1979.   On August  19,  1988, the  Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\") commenced  deportation proceedings\n\nagainst  petitioner,  alleging  his deportability  under  section\n\n241(a)(11) of  the Immigration  and Nationality Act  (the \"Act\"),\n\n8 U.S.C.    1251(a)(11), as  an alien  convicted of  a controlled\n\nsubstance  violation  (cocaine).

The notice did not mention the application filing\n\ndeadline.\n\n          On  September   14,  petitioner  filed  his      212(c)\n\napplication  by paying  the  application fee  at the  Providence,\n\nRhode Island office of the INS.

He asserts that  his attorney did  not file the\n\napplication  on  June 16  because  the  immigration judge  stated\n\nduring  the February  27 hearing that  the application  should be\n\nfiled ten days prior to  the hearing.

Petitioner first emphasizes  that his counsel\n\nrecalls that the time  limit specified was ten days prior  to the\n\nhearing and that the immigration judge waited until  September 18\n\nto order deportation.  We cannot draw the inference he desires --\n\ni.e., that the immigration judge also thought the application due\n\nonly ten days before  the rescheduled hearing -- in  light of the\n\nplain  evidence  in the  record that  the  deadline was  June 16.\n\nPerhaps, for  example, the  immigration judge did  not issue  the\n\norder until September 18 because he reviewed his calendar on that\n\nday;  we can  only speculate, a  procedure contrary  to appellate\n\nreview.  Second, failure to comply with time limitations is often\n\nthe  fault of  counsel rather  than the  client, and  clients are\n\nbound  by the conduct of  their attorneys.

Finally,  while petitioner  contends no\n\nprejudice   has  occurred,   these  appellate   proceedings  have\n\nsubstantially  delayed  petitioner's   deportation  despite   his\n\neligibility  for  deportation  under    241(a)(11).    Since  the\n\nBoard's  factual finding  that  petitioner untimely  filed his   \n\n212(c) application  is supported  by substantial evidence  in the\n\nrecord, we affirm  its decision to affirm the  deportation order.\n\nSee Gouveia v.
