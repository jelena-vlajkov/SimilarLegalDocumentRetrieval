(Giroux)  appeals  from  the grant  of\r\n\nsummary judgment in favor of New England Teamsters &amp; Trucking\r\n\nIndustry  Pension  Fund (the  Fund),  the plan  sponsor  of a\r\n\nmulti-employer   employee  benefit   plan  in   which  Giroux\r\n\nparticipated.   Giroux sought a declaration  of non-liability\r\n\nfor the  Fund's assessment of withdrawal  liability under the\r\n\nEmployee Retirement Income  Security Act (ERISA), as  amended\r\n\nby  the Multiemployer  Pension  Plan Amendments  Act of  1980\r\n\n(MPPAA),  29 U.S.C.   1381 et seq, claiming the Fund's demand\r                                             \r\n\nwas barred by  the statute of limitations, and  that hardship\r\n\nshould excuse it from the obligation to make interim payments\r\n\nof the Fund's demand pending resolution of this dispute.  The\r\n\nFund  counterclaimed to  the contrary.   The  court concluded\r\n\nthat  the Fund's demand was not barred, that Giroux failed to\r\n\nallege facts sufficient  to show irreparable harm in order to\r\n\navoid  its  obligation to  make  interim  payments, and  that\r\n\nresolution of its  withdrawal liability dispute  is committed\r\n\nin the first instance to arbitration.  We affirm.\r\n\n          The parties agreeing to the material facts, we take\r\n\na moment to trace  the genesis and procedural history  of the\r\n\ncontroversy.  Giroux had been making pension contributions to\r\n\nthe Fund  on behalf of  its employees for  a number  of years\r\n\npursuant to  a standard, industry-wide  collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement to which it  periodically renewed its allegiance by\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nexecuting \"supplements\"  with a Teamsters local.   It decided\r\n\nto  stop with the last executed agreement upon its expiration\r\n\nin 1981  or 1982, but neglected  to notify the local,  or the\r\n\nFund.  In light of a  common industry tolerance  for delay in\r\n\nexecuting renewals,1 failure to execute a new agreement would\r\n\nnot necessarily give rise to an inference that an employer no\r\n\nlonger intended  to be  bound, and Giroux  continued, without\r\n\ninterruption, to make  employee contributions  to the  Fund's\r\n\npension plan until early  1994.  When these payments  ceased,\r\n\nthe Fund  responded by sending Giroux  a standard delinquency\r\n\nnotice,  to which  Giroux responded  that it  had \"not  had a\r\n\ncollective bargaining agreement with  the Teamsters for  some\r\n\n15-20  years,\"  and  thus   had  no  obligation  to  continue\r\n\ncontributions.  The Fund then  verified that Giroux had never\r\n\nexecuted any successors to the agreement that expired in 1981\r\n\nor  1982,  and  conceded   Giroux  thus  had  no  contractual\r\n\nobligation to contribute after that point.  The parties agree\r\n\nthat  Giroux therefore  \"withdrew\" from  the Fund  within the\r\n\nmeaning of the  MPPAA,   1383(a)(1),  upon expiration of  its\r\n\nlast  collective bargaining  agreement, sometime  in 1981  or\r\n\n1982.   The Fund therefore  assessed and demanded  payment of\r\n\nwithdrawal liability from Giroux as of September 30, 1981, as\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  district  court noted  that  gaps  of several  years\r\nbetween  expiration and  renewal are  not uncommon  among the\r\nthousands  of   employers  that  adhere  to   the  collective\r\nbargaining  agreement  through  executing   supplements  with\r\nTeamsters locals.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nprovided.  29 U.S.C   1381 et seq.\r                                              \r\n\n          In  October,  1994,  Giroux  initiated  arbitration\r\n\naccording to the MPPAA's mandatory arbitration provision, id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat     1401,  claiming   the  Fund's  demand  for  withdrawal\r\n\nliability  payment   some  12   years  after  its   effective\r\n\nwithdrawal was untimely, and, even if timely, it was entitled\r\n\nto   credit  for   post-withdrawal  contributions.     Giroux\r\n\nsimultaneously  instigated  this action  in  the  District of\r\n\nMassachusetts for declaratory judgment that the Fund's demand\r\n\nwas statutorily  barred by the six  year limitation contained\r\n\nin   1451(f),  and for injunctive relief from  its obligation\r\n\nunder    1399(c)(2) to  make interim  payments of  the Fund's\r\n\nwithdrawal  liability  assessment pending  resolution  of its\r\n\nclaims.    The  Fund  counterclaimed to  the  contrary.    It\r\n\nstressed  that  the timeliness  of  its  demand was  governed\r\n\nexclusively  by    1399(b),  which  in  turn  is  statutorily\r\n\ncommitted  to resolution  through  arbitration, 29  U.S.C.   \r\n\n1401(a)(1), and sought declaratory relief.\r\n\n          In December,  1994, the  district court ruled  that\r\n\nthe  Fund's demand was not barred by   1451(f), that Giroux's\r\n\nallegations  of   financial  hardship   did  not   amount  to\r\n\n\"irreparable  harm\"  sufficient to  exempt it  from statutory\r\n\nobligation to  make interim payments, and  that any remaining\r\n\ndispute  with respect to the Fund's demand had to be resolved\r\n\nthrough   arbitration.     Giroux's  appeal  was   argued  in\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nSeptember, 1995.\r\n\n          In October, 1995, the arbitrator ruled, inter alia,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthat  Giroux was  estopped  from contending  that the  Fund's\r\n\ndemand was  untimely by  its own \"equivocal\"  and \"deceitful\"\r\n\nactions,  and that  the Fund's  demand was  made \"as  soon as\r\n\npracticable\" under   1399(b)(1) in any event; it  declined to\r\n\nrule on  Giroux's offset  claim.   Both parties briefed  this\r\n\ncourt on the implications of  the arbitration award for  this\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n                    I.  Withdrawal Liability\r                                                        \r\n\n          The  MPPAA  was enacted  in  response  to a  crisis\r\n\nfacing multi-employer  pension plans from which employers had\r\n\nwithdrawn in  increasing numbers,  leaving the  plans without\r\n\nadequate funds to pay vested  employee benefits.  See Pension\r                                                                         \r\n\nBenefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A.

The act makes an employer withdrawing from such a\r\n\nplan  liable  for  its  proportionate  share  of  the  plan's\r\n\nunfunded vested benefits.   Id.  at 725; 29  U.S.C.     1381,\r                                           \r\n\n1391.     Withdrawal  generally   occurs  when  an   employer\r\n\npermanently ceases to have  an obligation to contribute under\r\n\nthe  plan,  or  ceases  all   covered  operations.

Statute of Limitations\r                                                        \r\n\n          Giroux  seeks  to  avoid  the  Fund's   demand  for\r\n\nwithdrawal  liability  payment  by invoking  the  limitations\r\n\nprovision of the MPPAA, which states, in relevant part,  that\r\n\na plan fiduciary\r\n\n          who is  adversely affected by the  act or\r\n          omission of any party under this subtitle\r\n          with    respect   to    a   multiemployer\r\n          plan, . . .  may  bring  an   action  for\r\n          appropriate legal or equitable relief, or\r\n          both,\r\n\n29 U.S.C.   1451(a)(1), but no later than\r\n\n          (1) 6  years after the date  on which the\r\n          cause of action arose, or\r\n\n          (2) 3  years after  the earliest date  on\r\n          which  the  plaintiff acquired  or should\r\n          have  acquired  actual  knowledge of  the\r\n          existence of such cause of action; except\r\n          that in the case of fraud or concealment,\r\n          such action may be brought not later than\r\n          6 years after  the date  of discovery  of\r\n          the existence of such cause of action.\r\n\nId. at    1451(f).  Giroux  claims that because the  Fund did\r               \r\n\nnot demand  withdrawal liability payment until  some 12 years\r\n\nafter Giroux's  withdrawal from the Fund's  pension plan, its\r\n\ndemand is barred by this provision.\r\n\n          The Fund contends on appeal that its demand in this\r\n\ncase is not governed by   1451(f) because this provision is a\r\n\nlimitation only on litigation, and since it did not instigate\r                                                       \r\n\nthis  lawsuit but  merely demanded  payment according  to its\r\n\nstatutory rights, it has not commenced an \"action\" within the\r\n\nmeaning of   1451.  Thus, according to  the Fund, the statute\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nof limitations cannot have  begun to run with respect  to any\r\n\naction it could bring to enforce these rights.\r                                            \r\n\n          We cannot  agree that an action  for declaration of\r\n\nnon-liability  asserting a  statute  of  limitations  defense\r\n\nrenders the statute inapplicable simply by virtue of the fact\r\n\nthat  the  party  claiming  liability did  not  commence  the\r\n\naction,  especially  where  (but   not  because)  that  party\r\n\ncounterclaimed for declaration and enforcement of its rights.\r\n\nHowever,  the principal question  raised by  Giroux's action,\r\n\nwhether  the  Fund  timely  made its  demand,  is  explicitly\r\n\ngoverned by   1399, which provides:\r\n\n          As   soon   as   practicable   after   an\r\n          employer's     complete    or     partial\r\n          withdrawal, the plan sponsor shall--\r\n\n          (A)  notify the employer of--\r\n\n               (i) the amount of the liability, and\r\n\n               (ii) the schedule for liability payments,\r\n               and\r\n\n          (B) demand payment in accordance with the\r\n          schedule.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.   1399(b)(1).   The MPPAA further provides  that if\r\n\nthe Fund's  demand for withdrawal liability  payment was made\r\n\n\"as  soon  as  practicable,\"  then   it  is  due  and  owing,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  a pending dispute, id. at   1399(c)(1)(A)(i)\r                                                   \r\n\nand  (2),  and  the  Fund  can  bring  an  action  to  compel\r\n\n\"immediate  payment\"  of  any  outstanding  amounts,  id.  at\r                                                                     \r\n\n   1399(c)(5)  and  1451(a), subject  to  the statutory  time\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nlimitation.    Id.  at   1451(f).    We  find this  statutory\r                              \r\n\nframework  governing a plan  sponsor's demand  for withdrawal\r\n\nliability payment  sufficiently clear  so that to  the extent\r\n\nthe general 6 year  limitation on actions conflicts, Congress\r\n\ndid  not intend  it  to override.    We therefore  hold  that\r\n\nquestions  concerning  the  timeliness of  a  plan  sponsor's\r\n\ndemand  are  governed  exclusively  by    1399(b)(1).    Thus\r\n\nresolution  of Giroux's  claim  turns solely  on whether  the\r\n\nFund's  demand  was  made  \"as  soon  as  practicable\"  after\r\n\nGiroux's withdrawal.2\r\n\n          However,  any dispute  regarding the  timeliness of\r\n\nthe Fund's demand under   1399(b)(1) is statutorily committed\r\n\nto   arbitration  in   the   first  instance.     29   U.S.C.\r\n\n  1401(a)(1).3   This  is  no less  so  because it  may  also\r\n\ninvolve  a measure  of statutory  interpretation.

Although it might conserve resources\r\n\nin  this instance to  concur, we disagree.   Rather, Giroux's\r\n\nonly recourse is to pursue judicial review of the arbitration\r\n\naward:\r\n\n          Upon   completion   of  the   arbitration\r\n          proceedings   in  favor  of  one  of  the\r\n          parties,any  party  thereto may  bring an\r\n          action, no later  than 30 days  after the\r\n          issuance  of an arbitrator's award, in an\r\n          appropriate United  States district court\r\n          in  accordance with section  1451 of this\r\n          title to enforce,  vacate, or modify  the\r\n          arbitrator's award.\r\n\n29  U.S.C.   1401(b)(2).  This simultaneously pending action,\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nbrought separately  to assert a claim  under a non-arbitrable\r\n\nprovision of the MPPAA,  does not qualify as a  proper appeal\r\n\nof  the arbitrator's ruling.   We see no  reason to undertake\r\n\nreview of the arbitrator's analysis when it is beyond serious\r\n\ndispute that issues  arising under   1399  cannot normally be\r\n\nlitigated in  federal court  independent of  arbitration, and\r\n\nthe process for appealing an arbitration award is clear.\r\n\n          We are well  aware that  enforcing the  statutorily\r\n\nmandated procedure in this case could land it again before us\r\n\nin substantially the same posture after additional expense on\r\n\nboth  sides, and  that the  legislative  aim in  enacting the\r\n\nMPPAA included  lessening the  costs and delay  of withdrawal\r\n\nliability dispute resolution.  See, e.g., I.A.M. Nat. Pension\r                                                                         \r\n\nFund v.

Yet,  to hold\r\n\notherwise would create a loophole for employers to bypass the\r\n\nstatutory  scheme  by  disguising  arbitrable   disputes  for\r\n\npresentation directly  in federal court, as  Giroux did here,\r\n\nthen  invoking legislative  purpose  in order  to get  prompt\r\n\nappellate consideration.  Because this is not a proper appeal\r\n\nof the  arbitrator's award,  and we decline  to independently\r\n\nreach Giroux's  arbitrable claims,  we do not  review whether\r\n\nthe Fund's demand was  made \"as soon as practicable,\"  or any\r\n\nother arbitrable issues.\r\n\n          IV.

(Giroux)  appeals  from  the grant  of\r\n\nsummary judgment in favor of New England Teamsters &amp; Trucking\r\n\nIndustry  Pension  Fund (the  Fund),  the plan  sponsor  of a\r\n\nmulti-employer   employee  benefit   plan  in   which  Giroux\r\n\nparticipated.   Giroux sought a declaration  of non-liability\r\n\nfor the  Fund's assessment of withdrawal  liability under the\r\n\nEmployee Retirement Income  Security Act (ERISA), as  amended\r\n\nby  the Multiemployer  Pension  Plan Amendments  Act of  1980\r\n\n(MPPAA),  29 U.S.C.   1381 et seq, claiming the Fund's demand\r                                             \r\n\nwas barred by  the statute of limitations, and  that hardship\r\n\nshould excuse it from the obligation to make interim payments\r\n\nof the Fund's demand pending resolution of this dispute.  The\r\n\nFund  counterclaimed to  the contrary.   The  court concluded\r\n\nthat  the Fund's demand was not barred, that Giroux failed to\r\n\nallege facts sufficient  to show irreparable harm in order to\r\n\navoid  its  obligation to  make  interim  payments, and  that\r\n\nresolution of its  withdrawal liability dispute  is committed\r\n\nin the first instance to arbitration.  We affirm.\r\n\n          The parties agreeing to the material facts, we take\r\n\na moment to trace  the genesis and procedural history  of the\r\n\ncontroversy.  Giroux had been making pension contributions to\r\n\nthe Fund  on behalf of  its employees for  a number  of years\r\n\npursuant to  a standard, industry-wide  collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement to which it  periodically renewed its allegiance by\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nexecuting \"supplements\"  with a Teamsters local.   It decided\r\n\nto  stop with the last executed agreement upon its expiration\r\n\nin 1981  or 1982, but neglected  to notify the local,  or the\r\n\nFund.  In light of a  common industry tolerance  for delay in\r\n\nexecuting renewals,1 failure to execute a new agreement would\r\n\nnot necessarily give rise to an inference that an employer no\r\n\nlonger intended  to be  bound, and Giroux  continued, without\r\n\ninterruption, to make  employee contributions  to the  Fund's\r\n\npension plan until early  1994.  When these payments  ceased,\r\n\nthe Fund  responded by sending Giroux  a standard delinquency\r\n\nnotice,  to which  Giroux responded  that it  had \"not  had a\r\n\ncollective bargaining agreement with  the Teamsters for  some\r\n\n15-20  years,\"  and  thus   had  no  obligation  to  continue\r\n\ncontributions.  The Fund then  verified that Giroux had never\r\n\nexecuted any successors to the agreement that expired in 1981\r\n\nor  1982,  and  conceded   Giroux  thus  had  no  contractual\r\n\nobligation to contribute after that point.  The parties agree\r\n\nthat  Giroux therefore  \"withdrew\" from  the Fund  within the\r\n\nmeaning of the  MPPAA,   1383(a)(1),  upon expiration of  its\r\n\nlast  collective bargaining  agreement, sometime  in 1981  or\r\n\n1982.   The Fund therefore  assessed and demanded  payment of\r\n\nwithdrawal liability from Giroux as of September 30, 1981, as\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  district  court noted  that  gaps  of several  years\r\nbetween  expiration and  renewal are  not uncommon  among the\r\nthousands  of   employers  that  adhere  to   the  collective\r\nbargaining  agreement  through  executing   supplements  with\r\nTeamsters locals.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nprovided.  29 U.S.C   1381 et seq.\r                                              \r\n\n          In  October,  1994,  Giroux  initiated  arbitration\r\n\naccording to the MPPAA's mandatory arbitration provision, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>\r                                                                         \r\n\nat     1401, </span><pre class=\"inline\"> claiming   the  Fund's  demand  for  withdrawal\r\n\nliability  payment   some  12   years  after  its   effective\r\n\nwithdrawal was untimely, and, even if timely, it was entitled\r\n\nto   credit  for   post-withdrawal  contributions.     Giroux\r\n\nsimultaneously  instigated  this action  in  the  District of\r\n\nMassachusetts for declaratory judgment that the Fund's demand\r\n\nwas statutorily  barred by the six  year limitation contained\r\n\nin   1451(f),  and for injunctive relief from  its obligation\r\n\nunder    1399(c)(2) to  make interim  payments of  the Fund's\r\n\nwithdrawal  liability  assessment pending  resolution  of its\r\n\nclaims.    The  Fund  counterclaimed to  the  contrary.    It\r\n\nstressed  that  the timeliness  of  its  demand was  governed\r\n\nexclusively  by    1399(b),  which  in  turn  is  statutorily\r\n\ncommitted  to resolution  through  arbitration, 29  U.S.C.   \r\n\n1401(a)(1), and sought declaratory relief.\r\n\n          In December,  1994, the  district court ruled  that\r\n\nthe  Fund's demand was not barred by   1451(f), that Giroux's\r\n\nallegations  of   financial  hardship   did  not   amount  to\r\n\n\"irreparable  harm\"  sufficient to  exempt it  from statutory\r\n\nobligation to  make interim payments, and  that any remaining\r\n\ndispute  with respect to the Fund's demand had to be resolved\r\n\nthrough   arbitration.

Although it might conserve resources\r\n\nin  this instance to  concur, we disagree.   Rather, Giroux's\r\n\nonly recourse is to pursue judicial review of the arbitration\r\n\naward:\r\n\n          Upon   completion   of  the   arbitration\r\n          proceedings   in  favor  of  one  of  the\r\n          parties,any  party  thereto may  bring an\r\n          action, no later  than 30 days  after the\r\n          issuance  of an arbitrator's award, in an\r\n          appropriate United  States district court\r\n          in  accordance with section  1451 of this\r\n          title to enforce,  vacate, or modify  the\r\n          arbitrator's award.\r\n\n29  U.S.C.   1401(b)(2).  This simultaneously pending action,\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nbrought separately  to assert a claim  under a non-arbitrable\r\n\nprovision of the MPPAA,  does not qualify as a  proper appeal\r\n\nof  the arbitrator's ruling.   We see no  reason to undertake\r\n\nreview of the arbitrator's analysis when it is beyond serious\r\n\ndispute that issues  arising under   1399  cannot normally be\r\n\nlitigated in  federal court  independent of  arbitration, and\r\n\nthe process for appealing an arbitration award is clear.\r\n\n          We are well  aware that  enforcing the  statutorily\r\n\nmandated procedure in this case could land it again before us\r\n\nin substantially the same posture after additional expense on\r\n\nboth  sides, and  that the  legislative  aim in  enacting the\r\n\nMPPAA included  lessening the  costs and delay  of withdrawal\r\n\nliability dispute resolution.
