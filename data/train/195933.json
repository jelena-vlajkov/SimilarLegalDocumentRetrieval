Baez challenges  his convictions,\n\nasserting that he was deprived of a fair trial because of (1)\n\nthe  district court's failure to hold an in camera hearing to\r                                                              \n\ndetermine the truthfulness of a search warrant affidavit; and\n\n(2)  a  duplicitous count  in his  indictment.   Valerio also\n\nchallenges  her convictions, contending that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to  support them.

Background Facts\r            A.  Background Facts\r                                \n\n          Because this case involves a challenge to  criminal\n\nconvictions,  we interpret  the  evidence in  the light  most\n\namenable to the government.   See United States v.  Ortiz, 23\r                                                                     \n\nF.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          Prior to July 21, 1993, Providence Police Detective\n\nStanley Nadrowski, pursuant to an on-going investigation, led\n\na  police  team  that  conducted  several   surveillances  of\n\napartment buildings  at 165 Peace  Street, Providence,  Rhode\n\nIsland, and 49  Marden Street, Cranston,  Rhode Island.   The\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nteam  also  surveilled a  gray  Chevrolet  with Rhode  Island\n\nlicense plate YC-243, which was seen at both addresses.\n\n          At approximately 7:00 p.m. on July 21, 1993, in the\n\ncourse of one of  these surveillances, Nadrowski noticed Baez\n\nleave 165 Peace  Street, enter the gray  Chevrolet, and drive\n\noff.  Nadrowski and several other members of the surveillance\n\nteam  followed Baez to 49  Marden Street, which  they saw him\n\nenter.  Subsequently, the  police officers observed Baez exit\n\nthe building and drive onto Route 10.  They followed him into\n\nProvidence, where he turned onto Westminster Street.  At this\n\npoint, the police  stopped him.  Baez got out  of his vehicle\n\nand dropped a plastic bag containing 13.9 grams of cocaine to\n\nthe ground.  The police  then arrested him.  In  Baez's right\n\nfront  pants  pocket,  the  officers  found  a  set  of  keys\n\ncontaining keys  to 165 Peace  Street and  49 Marden  Street.\n\nOne of the keys was labeled \"49 Marden Street #7.\"\n\n          At  the  time  of  Baez's arrest,  the  police  had\n\nalready  obtained  a search  warrant  for  165 Peace  Street.\n\nAfter  his  arrest, the  police also  obtained a  warrant for\n\nApartment 7 at 49  Marden Street.  The Marden  Street warrant\n\nwas executed first, and  the search of those premises  led to\n\nthe  discovery of 515.6 grams of cocaine, along with a Tanita\n\nscale  of the type used to  weigh narcotics.  The cocaine was\n\nfound in a Brillo box underneath a nightstand in the bedroom;\n\non top of an adjoining bureau was a picture of Baez.\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          After the  search of  49 Marden Street,  the police\n\nexecuted  the  search  warrant  for  the  first  floor  right\n\napartment  at  165 Peace  Street.   Valerio  and a  baby were\n\npresent in the apartment at the time the search was executed.\n\nNadrowski  searched the  only bedroom  in the  apartment, and\n\nfound men's and women's clothing, two pairs of Baez's shorts,\n\nphoto  albums  containing pictures  of  Baez  and Valerio,  a\n\nwoman's   flowered  purse,  identification   cards  and  rent\n\nreceipts in Valerio's name, a child's health records to which\n\nValerio's name was affixed, and a bassinet.  He and the other\n\nofficers also found  73.24 grams of cocaine and  an operable,\n\nunloaded .357 handgun.  Most of the cocaine was  found in the\n\nlining  under the  seat cushion of  a chair next  to the bed;\n\n14.83  grams of it, however, were found inside a baby's shoe,\n\nwhich  was on  a bedroom  shelf.   The  gun was  next to  the\n\ncocaine  in  the chair  lining.   At  the conclusion  of this\n\nsearch, Valerio was arrested.\n\n          At  trial,  the   landlord  of  165   Peace  Street\n\ntestified that Baez had rented the  apartment in April, 1993,\n\nand  that Baez had requested that the rent receipts be issued\n\nin the name of Maria Valerio.  The receipts bearing Valerio's\n\nname were  introduced with a cautionary  instruction from the\n\ncourt that they could be considered in connection with Baez's\n\ncase,  but not Valerio's.  The landlord testified that he saw\n\nBaez two  or three times between  April, 1993 and the  day of\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe arrest.  He also testified that he had never seen Valerio\n\nbefore   the  night  of  her  arrest.    This  testimony  was\n\nconsistent with Baez's testimony that Valerio was not a long-\n\nterm  occupant of  the apartment, but  had been  visiting him\n\nfrom New York for the two or three days prior to her arrest.\n\nB.  Proceedings Below\r            B.  Proceedings Below\r                                 \n\n          On  November   9,  1993,  Baez  and   Valerio  were\n\narraigned on a superseding,  three-count indictment.  Count I\n\ncharged them  with conspiracy to distribute  and possess with\n\nthe intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  \n\n846; Count  II charged  them with the  underlying offense  of\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1); Count III charged them  with being\n\nillegal aliens in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.   922(g)(5).\n\n          The  defendants moved to  suppress the  cocaine and\n\nfirearm that were the  subject of the superseding indictment.\n\nThe  district court  denied the  motion.   Subsequently, Baez\n\nrenewed his suppression request,  alleging for the first time\n\nthat  the  affidavits  submitted  in support  of  the  search\n\nwarrants   were  false.   He accordingly  requested a  Franks\r                                                                         \n\nhearing.  See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 171-72 (1978)\r                                            \n\n(summarizing showing a defendant must  make to be entitled to\n\na  hearing on  the  adequacy of  a  warrant affidavit).    On\n\nJanuary 28, 1994, the  court granted the motion for  a Franks\r                                                                         \n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nhearing  and held a portion of it.   On February 3, 1994, the\n\ncourt  concluded  the hearing  and  denied  Baez's motion  to\n\nsuppress.  At that same time,  the court stated on the record\n\nthat it had been a mistake to grant Baez a  Franks hearing in\r                                                              \n\nthe first place.\n\n          On February 16, 1994, trial began.  Prior to trial,\n\nthe  government moved to dismiss  Count III of the indictment\n\nagainst  Valerio.  The district court granted the motion.  On\n\nMarch 1, 1994, the jury found Baez guilty on all three counts\n\nof  the indictment and found  Valerio guilty on  Counts I and\n\nII.  On  June 17, 1994, the district court  sentenced Baez to\n\n121 months in  prison, five years of  supervised release, and\n\n$150  in special  assessments.    That  same day,  the  court\n\nsentenced  Valerio to  13  months in  prison,  five years  of\n\nsupervised  release, and  $100 in  special assessments.   The\n\ncourt  also ordered the  defendants presented for deportation\n\nas a  condition  of their  supervised release.   This  appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                        Baez's Appeal\r                                    Baez's Appeal\r                                                 \n\n          Baez  makes two  arguments  on appeal.   First,  he\n\ncontends  that  the district  court  erred  in declining  his\n\nrequest, made  at the  conclusion of  the Franks  hearing, to\r                                                            \n\nconduct  an in camera proceeding at which the court would ask\r                                 \n\nthe  search warrant  affiant submitted questions  designed to\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nimpeach the  affiant's credibility.   Second, he  claims that\n\nCount II of  the superseding indictment was duplicitous.   It\n\nis Baez's  position that  the error  regarding the  in camera\r                                                                         \n\nhearing  requires  that  we  set  aside  all  three  of   his\n\nconvictions, and that the duplicitous count in the indictment\n\nrequires  that we  set  aside his  possession and  conspiracy\n\nconvictions.  The  arguments are without merit.\n\nA.  The Requested In Camera Hearing\r            A.  The Requested In Camera Hearing\r                                               \n\n          The   affidavits  submitted   in  support   of  the\n\napplications for warrants to search 49  Marden Street and 165\n\nPeace Street stated, inter  alia, that the affiant, Detective\r                                            \n\nNadrowski,  had  received  information  from  a  confidential\n\ninformant  that a Hispanic male  (who turned out  to be Baez)\n\nwas  distributing  cocaine  out  of  the  first  floor  right\n\napartment at  165 Peace Street.   The affidavits  also stated\n\nthat   this   same  confidential   informant,   under  police\n\nsupervision,  had made  two  recent controlled  purchases  of\n\ncocaine in  Baez's gray Chevrolet at  a prearranged location.\n\nIn moving for a Franks hearing,  Baez challenged the veracity\r                                  \n\nof  these statements, submitting as proof an affidavit of his\n\nown which swore  that he had never sold drugs  to anyone at a\n\nprearranged  location.    The  sum and  substance  of  Baez's\n\nposition  was that Nadrowski  had fabricated the confidential\n\ninformant's existence.\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Calling  Baez's  showing  \"marginal,\" the  district\n\ncourt nonetheless ruled that Baez's affidavit was substantial\n\nenough to warrant a Franks hearing.   See Franks, 438 U.S. at\r                                                            \n\n155-56 (defendant  is entitled to Franks hearing  if s/he can\r                                                    \n\nmake a \"substantial preliminary showing\" that (1) a statement\n\nin a warrant affidavit  was knowingly or intentionally false,\n\nor  made with reckless disregard  for the truth;  and (2) the\n\nfalsehood was  necessary to  the finding of  probable cause);\n\nsee  also United States v.  Hadfield, 918 F.2d  987, 992 (1st\r                                                \n\nCir.  1990), cert.  denied, 500  U.S. 936  (1991).   Baez and\r                                      \n\nNadrowski testified  at the  hearing, and both  gave accounts\n\nentirely  consistent   with  their  affidavits.    Baez  also\n\nprovided testimony elaborating on the reason for his entering\n\n49 Marden  Street prior to  his arrest.1   He stated  that he\n\nhad gone to  the building (for  the third time  that day)  in\n\norder  to  retrieve a  telephone  bill  for  the  renters  of\n\nApartment  7,  who were  out  of town  and had  asked  him to\n\nretrieve and to  safeguard the bill.  He  also stated that he\n\ndid not know when they would return.\n\n          Recognizing that  he had not carried  his burden of\n\nproving  that   the  warrant  affidavits  were   infected  by\n\nfalsehoods,  Baez asked,  at the  conclusion of  the hearing,\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  The affidavit submitted in  support of the request  for a\nwarrant  to search Apartment 7 at 49 Marden Street noted that\nBaez had entered the building just prior to his arrest.\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nthat the  district court further examine  Nadrowski in camera\r                                                                         \n\nregarding the  identity of  the confidential informant.   The\n\ndistrict  court  denied this  request,  stating  that such  a\n\nhearing was  not necessary.    The court  then denied  Baez's\n\nmotion to  suppress the evidence seized  during the execution\n\nof the search  warrants.  In so  doing, the court found  that\n\nNadrowski  had been a credible witness and that Baez had been\n\nless credible (particularly with regard to the reason for his\n\npresence at 49 Marden Street just prior to his arrest).\n\n          It  is settled  that  \"`a district  court need  not\n\nconduct  an in  camera hearing  whenever  the identity  of an\r                                  \n\ninformant is requested.'\"  United States v.

At the conclusion of the Franks hearing, the judge\r                                                      \n\ncredited the testimony of Detective Nadrowski and discredited\n\nthat of Baez.  He also found that he had heard enough at that\n\npoint  to  satisfy  himself  that  there  was  no  basis  for\n\nconcluding that  Nadrowski's affidavits were false.   We have\n\ncarefully reviewed  the transcript of the  Franks hearing and\r                                                             \n\ncan discern no error, let alone clear error,  in any of these\n\nrulings.

Baez never objected\n\nto  Count  II for  duplicity, or  any  other grounds,  in the\n\ndistrict court.  He accordingly has waived his argument.  See\r                                                                         \n\nFed. R. Crim.

Baez's problem\n\nwith Count  II does not lie  in the wording of  the count; it\n\nlies  in the  fact  that the  evidence  underlying the  count\n\nallegedly  could have  given  rise to  three separate  counts\n\ncharging  possession.   This is  not duplicity.   A  count is\n\nduplicitous when it charges more than one offense in a single\r                                       \n\ncount.  United States v.

Although other factors are involved, the\r                             \n\nprohibition against duplicitous indictments  arises primarily\n\nout of a concern that the jury may find a defendant guilty on\n\na  count without  having reached a  unanimous verdict  on the\n\ncommission  of  any particular  offense.    See id.  at  26.2\r                                                               \n\nObviously, this  only becomes  a problem when  the indictment\n\nactually  charges two  or more  offenses in  a  single count.\n\nHere,  Count II of  the indictment charged  only one offense:\n\n\"That  on or about  July 21, 1993,  in the District  of Rhode\n\nIsland, the  defendants, DOMINGO BAEZ and  MARIA VALERIO, did\n\nknowingly, willfully and intentionally possess with intent to\n\ndistribute a  mixture and  substance containing  a detectable\n\namount of cocaine, a Schedule II Controlled Substance.\"   The\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  For  example,  if Count  X  of  an indictment  charges  a\ndefendant  with  having committed  two offenses,  A and  B, a\nconviction would  be possible even  if Jurors 1-6  found only\nthat the defendant committed offense A, and jurors 7-12 found\nonly that the defendant committed offense B.  \n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nquestion  whether the  actions to  which this  count referred\n\ncould  have been  charged as  separate crimes  is irrelevant.\r                 \n\nThe count was not duplicitous.  \n\n          Accordingly, we reject  Baez's argument that  there\n\nwas a duplicitous count in his indictment.\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n                       Valerio's Appeal\r                                   Valerio's Appeal\r                                                   \n\n          Valerio's  sole  appellate  argument  is  that  the\n\nevidence  adduced at trial was not sufficient for the jury to\n\nhave concluded  beyond a reasonable doubt  that she possessed\n\nthe cocaine with an intent to distribute it, aided or abetted\n\nsuch a possession, or conspired  to commit such a possession.\n\nAfter carefully  reviewing the record, we agree.   Central to\n\nour  determination  is  a  belief that  the  jury  could  not\n\nreasonably  have   found  that  Valerio  had   an  intent  to\n\ndistribute cocaine.\n\n          We start by acknowledging the formidable showing  a\n\ndefendant  must  make  in order  to  prevail  on  a claim  of\n\ninsufficient   evidence.     In   conducting   a  sufficiency\n\nassessment,  \"we examine the record in a light most favorable\n\nto the  government, drawing all reasonable  inferences in its\n\nfavor,  with  an eye  towards  whether the  proof  would have\n\nallowed  a rational  jury  to determine  beyond a  reasonable\n\ndoubt that  the defendant was  guilty of the  crime charged.\"\n\nOrtiz,  23 F.3d  at 24.   \"In  this analysis,  no premium  is\r                 \n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nplaced  upon  direct as  opposed to  circumstantial evidence;\n\nboth  types of  proof  can adequately  ground a  conviction.\"\n\nUnited  States v.

See United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611\r                                                            \n\n(1st Cir.), petition for cert.  filed,     U.S.L.W.

For  Valerio to  have been\n\nconvicted under an aiding and abetting theory, the government\n\nhad  to   prove  that  (1)  Baez   committed  the  underlying\n\nsubstantive crime; and (2) Valerio \"associated [her]self with\n\nthe venture, participated in it as something  [s]he wished to\n\nbring about, and sought by [her] actions to make it succeed.\"\n\nLoder, 23 F.3d at  590-91 (citations omitted).  It  is clear,\r                 \n\ntherefore,  that both  of Valerio's  convictions must  be set\n\naside  if the jury could  not have found  beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Valerio intended  that the cocaine be distributed.\n\nNo such finding was possible on this record.\n\n          First, there was  no direct  evidence that  Valerio\n\nparticipated in or helped  facilitate the distribution of any\n\ncocaine.   Nor is there any direct evidence that she intended\n\nthat  the cocaine  be distributed.   Thus, the  government is\n\nleft to argue that proof of Valerio's distributive intent can\n\nbe found in  a type  of circumstantial evidence  of which  we\n\nhave  approved  on  several  occasions:    knowledge  of  the\n\nquantity of  the drugs involved.   See  Ortiz, 23 F.3d  at 25\r                                                         \n\n(intent to  distribute can be  inferred from the  quantity of\n\nthe controlled substance possessed) (citing United States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nEcheverri,  982 F.2d  675, 678  (1st Cir.  1993)).

This cocaine  was not in\n\nplain  view,  and not  likely to  have  been discovered  by a\n\nshort-term occupant of  the bedroom.4  And without  a finding\n\nthat Valerio knew  about this cocaine, the  quantity of drugs\n\nof which  Valerio was aware is not large enough to support an\n\ninference of distributive intent.   \n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  The  reasonableness  of  such  an  inference,  which  the\ngovernment urges us  to draw because Valerio was  taking care\nof  a baby  at the  time of  the search,  is open  to serious\nquestion.  First,  it appears  that the cocaine  in the  baby\nshoe  was not  in plain  view; that  is to  say, there  is no\nsuggestion that it was  sticking out of the shoe  and visible\nto occupants  of  the bedroom  in which  it was  found.   And\nsecond, the government did not attempt to prove at trial that\nthe  shoe belonged to Valerio's  baby.  When  these facts are\nconsidered in conjunction with the fact that the evidence was\ninsufficient  to prove that Valerio was anything other than a\nshort-term  visitor to the apartment,  see infra at 16-17, we\r                                                            \nare  skeptical that  any factfinder  could conclude  beyond a\nreasonable doubt that Valerio knew of the cocaine in the baby\nshoe.   \n\n4.  The government  asserts that  \"[a]lthough not exposed  to\nplain view, the cocaine was readily accessible since one only\nhad to turn over the chair  to find it.\"  The issue, however,\nis  not  accessibility;  it  is knowledge  of  the  cocaine's\nexistence.\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          Of course, if it had been demonstrated that Valerio\n\nwas  a  long-term occupant  of  the  apartment  at 165  Peace\n\nStreet, it might be  reasonable to infer that she  knew about\n\nall the drugs that were stored there.  The evidence  at trial\n\nwas insufficient, however, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat  Valerio  had  been  anything other  than  a  short-term\n\noccupant of the apartment at 165 Peace Street at the time  of\n\nher  arrest.  Although  the rent  receipts for  the apartment\n\nwere issued  in Valerio's name, the landlord of the apartment\n\ntestified  that this was done  at Baez's request;  and it was\n\nfor this reason  that the  court instructed the  jury not  to\n\nconsider  the  rent  receipts  in connection  with  the  case\n\nagainst Valerio.  Furthermore, the landlord testified that he\n\nlived at 165 Peace Street but had never seen Valerio prior to\n\nher  arrest.   And,  of course,  Baez himself  testified that\n\nValerio had only been visiting for two or three days prior to\n\nher arrest.  The jury  was free to disbelieve any and  all of\n\nthis  testimony; any inference of longer-term residence must,\n\nhowever, have been predicated on an evidentiary basis.  There\n\nwas no such basis here.5\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  The government  makes much of  the fact that  the bedroom\ncontained a flowered purse, identification cards for Valerio,\na child's  health care  record  to which  Valerio's name  was\naffixed,  and photo  albums containing  pictures of  Baez and\nValerio,  arguing that \"[t]hese are not the type of items one\nwould  expect to find if Valerio were merely a casual visitor\nto the apartment.\"   We cannot  agree; in our view,  there is\nnothing  at all unusual about  a mother of  a baby bringing a\npurse, identification, and the baby's health records along on\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          Before concluding, we  think it important to  point\n\nout that the evidence  against Valerio in this case  was even\n\nweaker than that  in other  cases in which  we have  reversed\n\nconvictions on sufficiency grounds.  \n\n          In United States  v. Ocampo, 964 F.2d  80 (1st Cir.\r                                                 \n\n1992),  for   instance,  we   held  that  the   evidence  was\n\ninsufficient   to  support  the  defendant's  conviction  for\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute  cocaine.  In\n\nthat  case,  the  evidence   showed,  inter  alia,  that  the\r                                                             \n\ndefendant had lived  in the apartment  where the cocaine  had\n\nbeen stored  for four to  six months,  and that she  had told\n\ninvestigating officers  that five quart-sized cans of acetone\n\nfound in  the apartment  (evidence at trial  established that\n\nacetone  is used to dilute  cocaine) were used  \"to clean off\n\nher fingernails.\"  Id. at 81-82.\r                                  \n\n          In  United States v.

In  that case,\n\nthe evidence  established that the defendant,  a twenty-year-\n\nold girl, had  spent nearly  four months at  sea in a  \"close\n\nrelationship\"  with the captain of a ship off whose stern was\n\nfloating approximately fifty pounds of marijuana.

The evidence here may  well have been sufficient to\n\nsupport a  finding that  Valerio possessed  cocaine.   It was\n\nnot,  however,  sufficient  to  support a  finding  that  she\n\nintended that cocaine be distributed.  Because such a finding\n\nwas a  necessary element of  her offenses of  conviction, her\n\nconvictions cannot stand.\n\n          Accordingly, we reverse Maria Valerio's convictions\n\nfor  possession  of cocaine  with  intent  to distribute  and\n\nconspiracy to commit the same offense.\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \n\n          For the  reasons stated, we affirm  the convictions\r                                                        \n\nof  defendant Domingo  Baez  and reverse  the convictions  of\r                                                    \n\ndefendant Maria Valerio.6\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.

Baez also was convicted of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm.  Baez challenges his convictions, asserting that he was deprived of a fair trial because of (1) the district court's failure to hold an in camera hearing to determine the truthfulness of a search warrant affidavit;  and (2) a duplicitous count in his indictment.

Background Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case involves a challenge to criminal convictions, we interpret the evidence in the light most amenable to the government.  See United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to July 21, 1993, Providence Police Detective Stanley Nadrowski, pursuant to an on-going investigation, led a police team that conducted several surveillances of apartment buildings at 165 Peace Street, Providence, Rhode Island, and 49 Marden Street, Cranston, Rhode Island.  The team also surveilled a gray Chevrolet with Rhode Island license plate YC-243, which was seen at both addresses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 7:00 p.m. on July 21, 1993, in the course of one of these surveillances, Nadrowski noticed Baez leave 165 Peace Street, enter the gray Chevrolet, and drive off.  Nadrowski and several other members of the surveillance team followed Baez to 49 Marden Street, which they saw him enter.  Subsequently, the police officers observed Baez exit the building and drive onto Route 10.  They followed him into Providence, where he turned onto Westminster Street.  At this point, the police stopped him.  Baez got out of his vehicle and dropped a plastic bag containing 13.9 grams of cocaine to the ground.  The police then arrested him.  In Baez's right front pants pocket, the officers found a set of keys containing keys to 165 Peace Street and 49 Marden Street.  One of the keys was labeled \"49 Marden Street # 7.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Baez's arrest, the police had already obtained a search warrant for 165 Peace Street.  After his arrest, the police also obtained a warrant for Apartment 7 at 49 Marden Street.  The Marden Street warrant was executed first, and the search of those premises led to the discovery of 515.6 grams of cocaine, along with a Tanita scale of the type used to weigh narcotics.  The cocaine was found in a Brillo box underneath a nightstand in the bedroom;  on top of an adjoining bureau was a picture of Baez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the search of 49 Marden Street, the police executed the search warrant for the first floor right apartment at 165 Peace Street.  Valerio and a baby were present in the apartment at the time the search was executed.  Nadrowski searched the only bedroom in the apartment, and found men's and women's clothing, two pairs of Baez's shorts, photo albums containing pictures of Baez and Valerio, a woman's flowered purse, identification cards and rent receipts in Valerio's name, a child's health records to which Valerio's name was affixed, and a bassinet.  He and the other officers also found 73.24 grams of cocaine and an operable, unloaded .357 handgun.  Most of the cocaine was found in the lining under the seat cushion of a chair next to the bed;  14.83 grams of it, however, were found inside a baby's shoe, which was on a bedroom shelf.  The gun was next to the cocaine in the chair lining.  At the conclusion of this search, Valerio was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the landlord of 165 Peace Street testified that Baez had rented the apartment in April, 1993, and that Baez had requested that the rent receipts be issued in the name of Maria Valerio.  The receipts bearing Valerio's name were introduced with a cautionary instruction from the court that they could be considered in connection with Baez's case, but not Valerio's.  The landlord testified that he saw Baez two or three times between April, 1993 and the day of the arrest.  He also testified that he had never seen Valerio before the night of her arrest.  This testimony was consistent with Baez's testimony that Valerio was not a long-term occupant of the apartment, but had been visiting him from New York for the two or three days prior to her arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 9, 1993, Baez and Valerio were arraigned on a superseding, three-count indictment.  Count I charged them with conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846;  Count II charged them with the underlying offense of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1);  Count III charged them with being illegal aliens in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to suppress the cocaine and firearm that were the subject of the superseding indictment.  The district court denied the motion.  Subsequently, Baez renewed his suppression request, alleging for the first time that the affidavits submitted in support of the search warrants were false.  He accordingly requested a Franks hearing.  See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 171-72, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2684-85, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978) (summarizing showing a defendant must make to be entitled to a hearing on the adequacy of a warrant affidavit).  On January 28, 1994, the court granted the motion for a Franks hearing and held a portion of it.  On February 3, 1994, the court concluded the hearing and denied Baez's motion to suppress.  At that same time, the court stated on the record that it had been a mistake to grant Baez a Franks hearing in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 1994, trial began.  Prior to trial, the government moved to dismiss Count III of the indictment against Valerio.  The district court granted the motion.  On March 1, 1994, the jury found Baez guilty on all three counts of the indictment and found Valerio guilty on Counts I and II.  On June 17, 1994, the district court sentenced Baez to 121 months in prison, five years of supervised release, and $150 in special assessments.  That same day, the court sentenced Valerio to 13 months in prison, five years of supervised release, and $100 in special assessments.  The court also ordered the defendants presented for deportation as a condition of their supervised release.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Baez's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baez makes two arguments on appeal.  First, he contends that the district court erred in declining his request, made at the conclusion of the Franks hearing, to conduct an in camera proceeding at which the court would ask the search warrant affiant submitted questions designed to impeach the affiant's credibility.  Second, he claims that Count II of the superseding indictment was duplicitous.  It is Baez's position that the error regarding the in camera hearing requires that we set aside all three of his convictions, and that the duplicitous count in the indictment requires that we set aside his possession and conspiracy convictions.  The arguments are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Requested In Camera Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavits submitted in support of the applications for warrants to search 49 Marden Street and 165 Peace Street stated, inter alia, that the affiant, Detective Nadrowski, had received information from a confidential informant that a Hispanic male (who turned out to be Baez) was distributing cocaine out of the first floor right apartment at 165 Peace Street.  The affidavits also stated that this same confidential informant, under police supervision, had made two recent controlled purchases of cocaine in Baez's gray Chevrolet at a prearranged location.  In moving for a Franks hearing, Baez challenged the veracity of these statements, submitting as proof an affidavit of his own which swore that he had never sold drugs to anyone at a prearranged location.  The sum and substance of Baez's position was that Nadrowski had fabricated the confidential informant's existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calling Baez's showing \"marginal,\" the district court nonetheless ruled that Baez's affidavit was substantial enough to warrant a Franks hearing.  See Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. at 2676 (defendant is entitled to Franks hearing if s/he can make a \"substantial preliminary showing\" that (1) a statement in a warrant affidavit was knowingly or intentionally false, or made with reckless disregard for the truth;  and (2) the falsehood was necessary to the finding of probable cause);  see also United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 992 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 936, 111 S.Ct. 2062, 114 L.Ed.2d 466 (1991).  Baez and Nadrowski testified at the hearing, and both gave accounts entirely consistent with their affidavits.  Baez also provided testimony elaborating on the reason for his entering 49 Marden Street prior to his arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He stated that he had gone to the building (for the third time that day) in order to retrieve a telephone bill for the renters of Apartment 7, who were out of town and had asked him to retrieve and to safeguard the bill.  He also stated that he did not know when they would return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that he had not carried his burden of proving that the warrant affidavits were infected by falsehoods, Baez asked, at the conclusion of the hearing, that the district court further examine Nadrowski in camera regarding the identity of the confidential informant.  The district court denied this request, stating that such a hearing was not necessary.  The court then denied Baez's motion to suppress the evidence seized during the execution of the search warrants.  In so doing, the court found that Nadrowski had been a credible witness and that Baez had been less credible (particularly with regard to the reason for his presence at 49 Marden Street just prior to his arrest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled that \" 'a district court need not conduct an in camera hearing whenever the identity of an informant is requested.' \"  United States v. Higgins, 995 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting United States v. Fixen, 780 F.2d 1434, 1439 (9th Cir.1986)).  Instead, it is entirely within the discretion of the judge presented with the request to decide whether the disclosure is necessary in order to determine the believability of the testifying officer.  Id.  And there is, of course, a presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant.  Franks, 438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. at 2684.   Moreover, the factual findings made by a district court in connection with a Franks hearing are reviewed only for clear error.  United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 556 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 148, 126 L.Ed.2d 110 (1993) and --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 149, 126 L.Ed.2d 110 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we can perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial judge's refusal to hold the requested in camera hearing.  At the conclusion of the Franks hearing, the judge credited the testimony of Detective Nadrowski and discredited that of Baez.  He also found that he had heard enough at that point to satisfy himself that there was no basis for concluding that Nadrowski's affidavits were false.  We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Franks hearing and can discern no error, let alone clear error, in any of these rulings.  This ends the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject Baez's argument that the court's failure to hold an in camera hearing after the Franks hearing requires reversal of his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Duplicity in the Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baez's second argument, that Count II (the possession count) of the superseding indictment was duplicitous, requires little discussion.  Baez never objected to Count II for duplicity, or any other grounds, in the district court.  He accordingly has waived his argument.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) (defenses and objections based on defects in the indictment (other than that it fails to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense) must be raised prior to trial);  see also United States v. Sheehy, 541 F.2d 123, 130 (1st Cir.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to reach the merits of Baez's duplicity argument, we would reject it as based upon a misapprehension of the concept of duplicity.  Baez's problem with Count II does not lie in the wording of the count;  it lies in the fact that the evidence underlying the count allegedly could have given rise to three separate counts charging possession.  This is not duplicity.  A count is duplicitous when it charges more than one offense in a single count.  United States v. Huguenin, 950 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1991) (per curiam ).  Although other factors are involved, the prohibition against duplicitous indictments arises primarily out of a concern that the jury may find a defendant guilty on a count without having reached a unanimous verdict on the commission of any particular offense.  See id. at 26.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Obviously, this only becomes a problem when the indictment actually charges two or more offenses in a single count.  Here, Count II of the indictment charged only one offense:  \"That on or about July 21, 1993, in the District of Rhode Island, the defendants, DOMINGO BAEZ and MARIA VALERIO, did knowingly, willfully and intentionally possess with intent to distribute a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, a Schedule II Controlled Substance.\"   The question whether the actions to which this count referred could have been charged as separate crimes is irrelevant.  The count was not duplicitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject Baez's argument that there was a duplicitous count in his indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Valerio's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valerio's sole appellate argument is that the evidence adduced at trial was not sufficient for the jury to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that she possessed the cocaine with an intent to distribute it, aided or abetted such a possession, or conspired to commit such a possession.  After carefully reviewing the record, we agree.  Central to our determination is a belief that the jury could not reasonably have found that Valerio had an intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by acknowledging the formidable showing a defendant must make in order to prevail on a claim of insufficient evidence.  In conducting a sufficiency assessment, \"we examine the record in a light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, with an eye towards whether the proof would have allowed a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.\"  Ortiz, 23 F.3d at 24.  \"In this analysis, no premium is placed upon direct as opposed to circumstantial evidence;  both types of proof can adequately ground a conviction.\"  United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 710 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1005, 122 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993).  In fact, the government's proof may lay entirely in circumstantial evidence.  United States v. Akinola, 985 F.2d 1105, 1109 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That having been said, it must be borne in mind that the proof must still have been sufficient for the jury to have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 590 (1st Cir.1994).  Thus, although the government need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence in order to sustain the conviction, see Ortiz, 23 F.3d at 24, we are loath to stack inference upon inference in order to uphold the jury's verdict, cf. Ingram v. United States, 360 U.S. 672, 680, 79 S.Ct. 1314, 1320, 3 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1959) (citing Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 711, 63 S.Ct. 1265, 1269, 87 L.Ed. 1674 (1943)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to secure a conviction under the possession with intent to distribute count, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Valerio knowingly and intentionally possessed the drugs, and that she did so with an intent to distribute them.  United States v. Paulino, 13 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.1994).  Under the conspiracy count, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Valerio intended to agree and intended to effectuate the commission of the underlying possession with intent to distribute offense.  See United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1118, 130 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1995).  For Valerio to have been convicted under an aiding and abetting theory, the government had to prove that (1) Baez committed the underlying substantive crime;  and (2) Valerio \"associated [her]self with the venture, participated in it as something [s]he wished to bring about, and sought by [her] actions to make it succeed.\"  Loder, 23 F.3d at 590-91 (citations omitted).  It is clear, therefore, that both of Valerio's convictions must be set aside if the jury could not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Valerio intended that the cocaine be distributed.  No such finding was possible on this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there was no direct evidence that Valerio participated in or helped facilitate the distribution of any cocaine.  Nor is there any direct evidence that she intended that the cocaine be distributed.  Thus, the government is left to argue that proof of Valerio's distributive intent can be found in a type of circumstantial evidence of which we have approved on several occasions:  knowledge of the quantity of the drugs involved.  See Ortiz, 23 F.3d at 25 (intent to distribute can be inferred from the quantity of the controlled substance possessed) (citing United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir.1993)).  In other words, the government's position is that, because the quantity of drugs found in 165 Peace Street was not consistent with personal consumption, the jury correctly inferred a distributive intent on the part of Valerio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this position is that, even were we to infer that Valerio was aware of the 14.83 grams of cocaine in the baby shoe,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that Valerio knew of the existence of the cocaine in the chair lining.  This cocaine was not in plain view, and not likely to have been discovered by a short-term occupant of the bedroom.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  And without a finding that Valerio knew about this cocaine, the quantity of drugs of which Valerio was aware is not large enough to support an inference of distributive intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if it had been demonstrated that Valerio was a long-term occupant of the apartment at 165 Peace Street, it might be reasonable to infer that she knew about all the drugs that were stored there.  The evidence at trial was insufficient, however, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Valerio had been anything other than a short-term occupant of the apartment at 165 Peace Street at the time of her arrest.  Although the rent receipts for the apartment were issued in Valerio's name, the landlord of the apartment testified that this was done at Baez's request;  and it was for this reason that the court instructed the jury not to consider the rent receipts in connection with the case against Valerio.  Furthermore, the landlord testified that he lived at 165 Peace Street but had never seen Valerio prior to her arrest.  And, of course, Baez himself testified that Valerio had only been visiting for two or three days prior to her arrest.  The jury was free to disbelieve any and all of this testimony;  any inference of longer-term residence must, however, have been predicated on an evidentiary basis.  There was no such basis here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before concluding, we think it important to point out that the evidence against Valerio in this case was even weaker than that in other cases in which we have reversed convictions on sufficiency grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Ocampo, 964 F.2d 80 (1st Cir.1992), for instance, we held that the evidence was insufficient to support the defendant's conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine.  In that case, the evidence showed, inter alia, that the defendant had lived in the apartment where the cocaine had been stored for four to six months, and that she had told investigating officers that five quart-sized cans of acetone found in the apartment (evidence at trial established that acetone is used to dilute cocaine) were used \"to clean off her fingernails.\"  Id. at 81-82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Hyson, 721 F.2d 856 (1st Cir.1983), we found the evidence insufficient to support one defendant's conviction for conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute heroin, marijuana, hashish and cocaine.  In that case, the evidence established that this defendant lived with a codefendant in an apartment where hashish was stored and knew of its existence.

Mehtala, 578 F.2d 6 (1st Cir.1978), we found the evidence insufficient to support the defendant's conviction for knowingly and intentionally importing marijuana into the United States.  In that case, the evidence established that the defendant, a twenty-year-old girl, had spent nearly four months at sea in a \"close relationship\" with the captain of a ship off whose stern was floating approximately fifty pounds of marijuana.

First, it appears that the cocaine in the baby shoe was not in plain view;  that is to say, there is no suggestion that it was sticking out of the shoe and visible to occupants of the bedroom in which it was found.  And second, the government did not attempt to prove at trial that the shoe belonged to Valerio's baby.  When these facts are considered in conjunction with the fact that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Valerio was anything other than a short-term visitor to the apartment, see infra at 65, we are skeptical that any factfinder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Valerio knew of the cocaine in the baby shoe</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The government asserts that \"[a]lthough not exposed to plain view, the cocaine was readily accessible since one only had to turn over the chair to find it.\"   The issue, however, is not accessibility;  it is knowledge of the cocaine's existence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The government makes much of the fact that the bedroom contained a flowered purse, identification cards for Valerio, a child's health care record to which Valerio's name was affixed, and photo albums containing pictures of Baez and Valerio, arguing that \"[t]hese are not the type of items one would expect to find if Valerio were merely a casual visitor to the apartment.\"   We cannot agree;  in our view, there is nothing at all unusual about a mother of a baby bringing a purse, identification, and the baby's health records along on a multiple-day visit to a friend living approximately two hundred miles away.  And even if we assume that the photo albums were Valerio's (which we have no basis for doing), there is nothing in the record indicating that the albums were of such a nature, or set up in such a way, that they were unlikely to have been brought to Providence by Valerio on a short visit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Because Baez was convicted of conspiring both with Valerio and with \"other persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury,\" our reversal of Valerio's conspiracy conviction does not require reversal of Baez's conspiracy conviction</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

See United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195351\"><a href=\"/opinion/195351/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to July 21, 1993, Providence Police Detective Stanley Nadrowski, pursuant to an on-going investigation, led a police team that conducted several surveillances of apartment buildings at 165 Peace Street, Providence, Rhode Island, and 49 Marden Street, Cranston, Rhode Island.  The team also surveilled a gray Chevrolet with Rhode Island license plate YC-243, which was seen at both addresses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 7:00 p.m. on July 21, 1993, in the course of one of these surveillances, Nadrowski noticed Baez leave 165 Peace Street, enter the gray Chevrolet, and drive off.  Nadrowski and several other members of the surveillance team followed Baez to 49 Marden Street, which they saw him enter.  Subsequently, the police officers observed Baez exit the building and drive onto Route 10.  They followed him into Providence, where he turned onto Westminster Street.  At this point, the police stopped him.  Baez got out of his vehicle and dropped a plastic bag containing 13.9 grams of cocaine to the ground.  The police then arrested him.  In Baez's right front pants pocket, the officers found a set of keys containing keys to 165 Peace Street and 49 Marden Street.  One of the keys was labeled \"49 Marden Street # 7.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Baez's arrest, the police had already obtained a search warrant for 165 Peace Street.  After his arrest, the police also obtained a warrant for Apartment 7 at 49 Marden Street.  The Marden Street warrant was executed first, and the search of those premises led to the discovery of 515.6 grams of cocaine, along with a Tanita scale of the type used to weigh narcotics.  The cocaine was found in a Brillo box underneath a nightstand in the bedroom;  on top of an adjoining bureau was a picture of Baez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the search of 49 Marden Street, the police executed the search warrant for the first floor right apartment at 165 Peace Street.  Valerio and a baby were present in the apartment at the time the search was executed.  Nadrowski searched the only bedroom in the apartment, and found men's and women's clothing, two pairs of Baez's shorts, photo albums containing pictures of Baez and Valerio, a woman's flowered purse, identification cards and rent receipts in Valerio's name, a child's health records to which Valerio's name was affixed, and a bassinet.  He and the other officers also found 73.24 grams of cocaine and an operable, unloaded .357 handgun.  Most of the cocaine was found in the lining under the seat cushion of a chair next to the bed;  14.83 grams of it, however, were found inside a baby's shoe, which was on a bedroom shelf.  The gun was next to the cocaine in the chair lining.  At the conclusion of this search, Valerio was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the landlord of 165 Peace Street testified that Baez had rented the apartment in April, 1993, and that Baez had requested that the rent receipts be issued in the name of Maria Valerio.  The receipts bearing Valerio's name were introduced with a cautionary instruction from the court that they could be considered in connection with Baez's case, but not Valerio's.  The landlord testified that he saw Baez two or three times between April, 1993 and the day of the arrest.  He also testified that he had never seen Valerio before the night of her arrest.  This testimony was consistent with Baez's testimony that Valerio was not a long-term occupant of the apartment, but had been visiting him from New York for the two or three days prior to her arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 9, 1993, Baez and Valerio were arraigned on a superseding, three-count indictment.  Count I charged them with conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846;  Count II charged them with the underlying offense of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1);  Count III charged them with being illegal aliens in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to suppress the cocaine and firearm that were the subject of the superseding indictment.  The district court denied the motion.  Subsequently, Baez renewed his suppression request, alleging for the first time that the affidavits submitted in support of the search warrants were false.  He accordingly requested a Franks hearing.  See Franks v. Delaware, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 171-72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On January 28, 1994, the court granted the motion for a Franks hearing and held a portion of it.  On February 3, 1994, the court concluded the hearing and denied Baez's motion to suppress.  At that same time, the court stated on the record that it had been a mistake to grant Baez a Franks hearing in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 1994, trial began.  Prior to trial, the government moved to dismiss Count III of the indictment against Valerio.  The district court granted the motion.  On March 1, 1994, the jury found Baez guilty on all three counts of the indictment and found Valerio guilty on Counts I and II.  On June 17, 1994, the district court sentenced Baez to 121 months in prison, five years of supervised release, and $150 in special assessments.  That same day, the court sentenced Valerio to 13 months in prison, five years of supervised release, and $100 in special assessments.  The court also ordered the defendants presented for deportation as a condition of their supervised release.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Baez's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baez makes two arguments on appeal.  First, he contends that the district court erred in declining his request, made at the conclusion of the Franks hearing, to conduct an in camera proceeding at which the court would ask the search warrant affiant submitted questions designed to impeach the affiant's credibility.  Second, he claims that Count II of the superseding indictment was duplicitous.  It is Baez's position that the error regarding the in camera hearing requires that we set aside all three of his convictions, and that the duplicitous count in the indictment requires that we set aside his possession and conspiracy convictions.  The arguments are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Requested In Camera Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavits submitted in support of the applications for warrants to search 49 Marden Street and 165 Peace Street stated, inter alia, that the affiant, Detective Nadrowski, had received information from a confidential informant that a Hispanic male (who turned out to be Baez) was distributing cocaine out of the first floor right apartment at 165 Peace Street.  The affidavits also stated that this same confidential informant, under police supervision, had made two recent controlled purchases of cocaine in Baez's gray Chevrolet at a prearranged location.  In moving for a Franks hearing, Baez challenged the veracity of these statements, submitting as proof an affidavit of his own which swore that he had never sold drugs to anyone at a prearranged location.  The sum and substance of Baez's position was that Nadrowski had fabricated the confidential informant's existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calling Baez's showing \"marginal,\" the district court nonetheless ruled that Baez's affidavit was substantial enough to warrant a Franks hearing.

Baez also provided testimony elaborating on the reason for his entering 49 Marden Street prior to his arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He stated that he had gone to the building (for the third time that day) in order to retrieve a telephone bill for the renters of Apartment 7, who were out of town and had asked him to retrieve and to safeguard the bill.  He also stated that he did not know when they would return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that he had not carried his burden of proving that the warrant affidavits were infected by falsehoods, Baez asked, at the conclusion of the hearing, that the district court further examine Nadrowski in camera regarding the identity of the confidential informant.  The district court denied this request, stating that such a hearing was not necessary.  The court then denied Baez's motion to suppress the evidence seized during the execution of the search warrants.  In so doing, the court found that Nadrowski had been a credible witness and that Baez had been less credible (particularly with regard to the reason for his presence at 49 Marden Street just prior to his arrest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled that \" 'a district court need not conduct an in camera hearing whenever the identity of an informant is requested.' \"  United States v.

At the conclusion of the Franks hearing, the judge credited the testimony of Detective Nadrowski and discredited that of Baez.  He also found that he had heard enough at that point to satisfy himself that there was no basis for concluding that Nadrowski's affidavits were false.  We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Franks hearing and can discern no error, let alone clear error, in any of these rulings.

Baez never objected to Count II for duplicity, or any other grounds, in the district court.  He accordingly has waived his argument.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) (defenses and objections based on defects in the indictment (other than that it fails to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense) must be raised prior to trial);  see also United States v. Sheehy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"338707\"><a href=\"/opinion/338707/united-states-v-paul-j-sheehy/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to reach the merits of Baez's duplicity argument, we would reject it as based upon a misapprehension of the concept of duplicity.  Baez's problem with Count II does not lie in the wording of the count;  it lies in the fact that the evidence underlying the count allegedly could have given rise to three separate counts charging possession.  This is not duplicity.  A count is duplicitous when it charges more than one offense in a single count.  United States v. Huguenin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572653\"><a href=\"/opinion/572653/united-states-v-roland-leon-huguenin/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1991) (per curiam ).  Although other factors are involved, the prohibition against duplicitous indictments arises primarily out of a concern that the jury may find a defendant guilty on a count without having reached a unanimous verdict on the commission of any particular offense.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572653\"><a href=\"/opinion/572653/united-states-v-roland-leon-huguenin/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 26.</a></span><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Obviously, this only becomes a problem when the indictment actually charges two or more offenses in a single count.  Here, Count II of the indictment charged only one offense:  \"That on or about July 21, 1993, in the District of Rhode Island, the defendants, DOMINGO BAEZ and MARIA VALERIO, did knowingly, willfully and intentionally possess with intent to distribute a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, a Schedule II Controlled Substance.\"   The question whether the actions to which this count referred could have been charged as separate crimes is irrelevant.  The count was not duplicitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject Baez's argument that there was a duplicitous count in his indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Valerio's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valerio's sole appellate argument is that the evidence adduced at trial was not sufficient for the jury to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that she possessed the cocaine with an intent to distribute it, aided or abetted such a possession, or conspired to commit such a possession.  After carefully reviewing the record, we agree.  Central to our determination is a belief that the jury could not reasonably have found that Valerio had an intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by acknowledging the formidable showing a defendant must make in order to prevail on a claim of insufficient evidence.

United States v. Paulino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195130\"><a href=\"/opinion/195130/united-states-v-paulino/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1994).  Under the conspiracy count, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Valerio intended to agree and intended to effectuate the commission of the underlying possession with intent to distribute offense.  See United States v. Piper, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195585\"><a href=\"/opinion/195585/united-states-v-piper/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span> </span>(1995).  For Valerio to have been convicted under an aiding and abetting theory, the government had to prove that (1) Baez committed the underlying substantive crime;  and (2) Valerio \"associated [her]self with the venture, participated in it as something [s]he wished to bring about, and sought by [her] actions to make it succeed.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195365\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Loder,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195365/united-states-v-loder/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">590-91</span> </a></span>(citations omitted).  It is clear, therefore, that both of Valerio's convictions must be set aside if the jury could not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Valerio intended that the cocaine be distributed.  No such finding was possible on this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there was no direct evidence that Valerio participated in or helped facilitate the distribution of any cocaine.  Nor is there any direct evidence that she intended that the cocaine be distributed.  Thus, the government is left to argue that proof of Valerio's distributive intent can be found in a type of circumstantial evidence of which we have approved on several occasions:  knowledge of the quantity of the drugs involved.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195351\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ortiz,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195351/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">25</span> </a></span>(intent to distribute can be inferred from the quantity of the controlled substance possessed) (citing United States v.

In other words, the government's position is that, because the quantity of drugs found in 165 Peace Street was not consistent with personal consumption, the jury correctly inferred a distributive intent on the part of Valerio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this position is that, even were we to infer that Valerio was aware of the 14.83 grams of cocaine in the baby shoe,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that Valerio knew of the existence of the cocaine in the chair lining.  This cocaine was not in plain view, and not likely to have been discovered by a short-term occupant of the bedroom.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  And without a finding that Valerio knew about this cocaine, the quantity of drugs of which Valerio was aware is not large enough to support an inference of distributive intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, if it had been demonstrated that Valerio was a long-term occupant of the apartment at 165 Peace Street, it might be reasonable to infer that she knew about all the drugs that were stored there.  The evidence at trial was insufficient, however, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Valerio had been anything other than a short-term occupant of the apartment at 165 Peace Street at the time of her arrest.  Although the rent receipts for the apartment were issued in Valerio's name, the landlord of the apartment testified that this was done at Baez's request;  and it was for this reason that the court instructed the jury not to consider the rent receipts in connection with the case against Valerio.  Furthermore, the landlord testified that he lived at 165 Peace Street but had never seen Valerio prior to her arrest.  And, of course, Baez himself testified that Valerio had only been visiting for two or three days prior to her arrest.  The jury was free to disbelieve any and all of this testimony;  any inference of longer-term residence must, however, have been predicated on an evidentiary basis.  There was no such basis here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before concluding, we think it important to point out that the evidence against Valerio in this case was even weaker than that in other cases in which we have reversed convictions on sufficiency grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

In that case, the evidence showed, inter alia, that the defendant had lived in the apartment where the cocaine had been stored for four to six months, and that she had told investigating officers that five quart-sized cans of acetone found in the apartment (evidence at trial established that acetone is used to dilute cocaine) were used \"to clean off her fingernails.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583580\"><a href=\"/opinion/583580/united-states-v-anna-marie-ocampo/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 81-82.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

First, it appears that the cocaine in the baby shoe was not in plain view;  that is to say, there is no suggestion that it was sticking out of the shoe and visible to occupants of the bedroom in which it was found.  And second, the government did not attempt to prove at trial that the shoe belonged to Valerio's baby.  When these facts are considered in conjunction with the fact that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Valerio was anything other than a short-term visitor to the apartment, see infra at 65, we are skeptical that any factfinder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Valerio knew of the cocaine in the baby shoe</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The government asserts that \"[a]lthough not exposed to plain view, the cocaine was readily accessible since one only had to turn over the chair to find it.\"   The issue, however, is not accessibility;  it is knowledge of the cocaine's existence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The government makes much of the fact that the bedroom contained a flowered purse, identification cards for Valerio, a child's health care record to which Valerio's name was affixed, and photo albums containing pictures of Baez and Valerio, arguing that \"[t]hese are not the type of items one would expect to find if Valerio were merely a casual visitor to the apartment.\"   We cannot agree;  in our view, there is nothing at all unusual about a mother of a baby bringing a purse, identification, and the baby's health records along on a multiple-day visit to a friend living approximately two hundred miles away.  And even if we assume that the photo albums were Valerio's (which we have no basis for doing), there is nothing in the record indicating that the albums were of such a nature, or set up in such a way, that they were unlikely to have been brought to Providence by Valerio on a short visit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Because Baez was convicted of conspiring both with Valerio and with \"other persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury,\" our reversal of Valerio's conspiracy conviction does not require reversal of Baez's conspiracy conviction</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
