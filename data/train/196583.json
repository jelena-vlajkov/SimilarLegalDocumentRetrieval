This\r\n\ncourt  has thoroughly  reviewed the  record and  the parties'\r\n\nbriefs on appeal.   We  conclude that the  instant appeal  is\r\n\nfrivolous.   Jones has  failed to produce  the transcripts of\r\n\nthe  hearing on the U.S  Trustee's motion to  dismiss and the\r\n\nhearing  on  Jones' motion  for  reconsideration.   \"We  have\r\n\nrepeatedly held that  we will not review a claim  of error if\r\n\nthe  appellant has  failed  to include  a  transcript of  the\r\n\npertinent  proceedings  in  the record  on  appeal.\"  Valedon\r                                                                         \r\n\nMartinez v.

Absent  these transcripts,  we  are unable  to\r\n\nreview  Jones'  claim  that  the bankruptcy  court  erred  in\r\n\nfinding  that  he  was  not a  person  with  \"regular\" income\r\n\nentitled  to relief  under Chapter  13.   To the  extent that\r\n\nreview is possibleon therecord before us,we discern noerror.1\r                                                                        1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1We  note that Jones  offers conflicting  explanations for\r               1\r\nthe  absence of the 7/6/94  transcript.  His  brief says that\r\nthe court reporter informed his  wife that no such transcript\r\nexists because court was not held on that day.  A more recent\r\nfiling  indicates  that  the  transcript was  made,  but  has\r\n\"disappeared.\"   Jones offers no explanation  for the absence\r\nof the  10/5/94 transcript. \"The responsibility  for voids in\r\nthe appellate record must  reside with the party  whose claim\r\nof  error depends  for its  support upon  any portion  of the\r\nrecord  of the proceedings  below which was  omitted from the\r\ndesignation  of the record on  appeal.\"  In  re Abijoe Realty\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n     It further appears that the funds that were held  by the\r\n\nNew  Jersey Sheriff  were disbursed  long ago.   Accordingly,\r\n\nJones' claim that  the bankruptcy court erred  by refusing to\r\n\norder a  turn over of these  funds is moot. See  In re Public\r                                                                         \r\n\nService Company of  New Hampshire, 963 F.2d  469, 471-76 (1st\r                                             \r\n\nCir.),  cert. denied, 506 U.S. 908  (1992).  Jones' remaining\r                                \r\n\nclaims  on appeal are meritless for the reasons stated in the\r\n\ndistrict court's opinion.\r\n\n     The   judgment  of  the   district  court  is  summarily\r\n\naffirmed.   See Local Rule  27.1.  To  the extent that Jones'\r                           \r\n\n\"Emergency  Notification of a Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\nSeizure of  Incriminating Documents\"  seeks relief from  this\r\n\ncourt, it is denied.\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nCorp., 943 F.2d 121, 123  &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir. 1991).
