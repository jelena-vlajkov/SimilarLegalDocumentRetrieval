Leanders H. Smith appeals the district\n                    \n\ncourt's  order denying his motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)\n\nto reopen Smith's previously dismissed case against  appellee\n\nWGBH Educational Foundation, Inc.  We affirm.1  \n\n          Smith's motion  alleged that Smith had new evidence\n\nthat the  court's dismissal of  his Title VII  action against\n\nWGBH had been  based on WGBH's \"fraud, misrepresentation, . .\n\n.  or other  misconduct.\"   According  to Smith's  affidavit,\n\nwhich was attached to the  motion, the tape given by WGBH  to\n\nthe  district  court  in   1989  recorded  a  1981  telephone\n\nconversation with  his supervisor at WGBH,  John Plausse, and\n\nnot a  face-to-face conversation with Plausse  in 1984-85, as\n\nWGBH  had apparently  represented.   Smith  also submitted  a\n\nnotation  made  by a  union  attorney,  Eugene Salisbury,  in\n\nconnection  with  a  1982  labor grievance  settlement.    In\n\nrelevant  part,  the  notation  stated  simply  \"tapes,\"  but\n\nSalisbury's  December 1993  letter  to Smith  explained  that\n\n\"[t]he notation with  respect to  tapes has to  do with  your\n\ndestroying  certain tapes  which you  alleged  contained John\n\nPlausse's voice in some threatening episodes and to furnish a\n\ncopy to the company.\"  \n\n                    \n\n1.  Since  the  facts  and  legal  arguments  are  adequately\npresented in the briefs and record and our decisional process\nwould not be  significantly aided by oral argument, we hereby\ndeny Smith's motion  for oral argument.  See Fed.  R. App. P.\n                                            \n34(a).\n\n          Smith's  motion clearly  had  no merit.   As  Smith\n\nhimself acknowledges  in his brief, he  had already presented\n\nthe same  argument about WGBH's  alleged misrepresentation to\n\nthe  district court in his Motion for Relief From All Pending\n\nOrders  of the  Court  and for  the  Court to  Enter  Default\n\nJudgment Against WGBH, dated February 27, 1990.   That motion\n\nalso indicated that  Smith had actually  submitted a copy  of\n\nthe 1981 tape to  the court.  In  hearings before the  court,\n\nSmith had also  testified that  the tape given  the court  by\n\nWGBH dated from  before 1982.   The court's order  dismissing\n\nthe  case explicitly rejected that testimony, concluding that\n\nat least portions  of the  tape had dated  from the  relevant\n\ntime period (March 15, 1982-June 4, 1986).  \n\n          Nor does Salisbury's notation or  letter constitute\n\nevidence of  misrepresentation by  WGBH.  Neither  one states\n\nthat the  tape WGBH  gave the district  court was one  of the\n\ntapes  involved in the  1982 grievance settlement,  or a tape\n\nthat  did  not  date from  1984-85,  as  WGBH  had apparently\n\nasserted.  It is  Smith's affidavit that does  so.  But  that\n\naffidavit was based on knowledge Smith obviously possessed in\n\n1990, when he submitted  his Motion for Relief to  the court,\n\nand  so was  not newly discovered  evidence.   Therefore, the\n\ncourt did not abuse its  discretion in denying Smith's motion\n\nto  reopen  his  case on  the  ground  that  Smith had  newly\n\ndiscovered evidence about WGBH's alleged misrepresentation.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Smith  also  argues that  Salisbury's  notation and\n\nletter  show that the tape presented to the court was subject\n\nto the  1982 labor  grievance settlement,  in which  WGBH had\n\nwaived  its right to litigate  any claims arising  out of the\n\ngrievance.  For that reason, argues Smith, the district court\n\nhad  no jurisdiction to base  its dismissal of  his Title VII\n\naction against WGBH on that tape.  \n\n          Smith's  argument  in  this  respect  fails  for  a\n\nvariety  of reasons.  First, no one questioned that the court\n\nhad jurisdiction over Smith's Title VII action.  WGBH had not\n\ngiven  the  court  the  tape  in  an  attempt  to  relitigate\n\nsubstantive issues resolved in the 1982 grievance settlement,\n\nbut to  show the  court that  Smith had tapes  he had  denied\n\npossessing,  a  relevant  question  in the  Title  VII  case.\n\nSecond,  Smith's argument assumes that the  tape given to the\n\ncourt was a  tape dating from 1981,  but the court  had found\n\nthat  at least portions of  the tape dated  from the relevant\n\nportion of the 1982-86  discovery period.  Third, Salisbury's\n\nnotation  and letter  do not  say, let  alone show,  that the\n\ntapes  discussed  in  connection   with  the  1982  grievance\n\nsettlement included  the one  actually given to  the district\n\ncourt in 1989  by WGBH.  Finally, Smith failed  to explain to\n\nthe district  court when he had  first discovered Salisbury's\n\nnotation, or why he could not have discovered the notation at\n\nsome earlier  time.  (On appeal  to this court, he  says that\n\n                             -4-\n\nthe notation was sent  to him anonymously in  December 1993.)\n\nThus,  the  district court  had  no  reason  to believe  that\n\nSmith's motion  met the  requirements for Rule  60(b) relief.\n\nSee  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) (permitting relief from a final\n   \n\njudgment on the ground of newly discovered evidence \"which by\n\ndue  diligence could not have been discovered in time to move\n\nfor a  new trial under Rule  59(b)\"); Fed. R. Civ.  P. 59 (b)\n\n(permitting a motion for  a new trial to be brought within 10\n\ndays of entry of final judgment).\n\n          As  the  above  discussion  shows,  Smith's  motion\n\nlacked any  merit,  and Smith  had  no legitimate  basis  for\n\nbelieving that the court would  reopen his case against WGBH.\n\nThis is  especially so, since the allegedly  new evidence did\n\nnot  show   that  WGBH  had  intentionally   engaged  in  any\n\nmisrepresentation  as alleged,  nor did  it relieve  Smith of\n\nculpability for  the other instances of  misconduct which had\n\nmotivated the court to dismiss his action in the first place.\n\nAccordingly, we  think that this appeal  was frivolous within\n\nthe meaning of Fed. R. App. P. 38, and we  award double costs\n\nto WGBH.    \n\n          Affirmed.  Double costs awarded to appellee WGBH.  \n                                                           \n\n                             -5-\n",
