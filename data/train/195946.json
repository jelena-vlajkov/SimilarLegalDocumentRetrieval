He argues\n\nthat his  sixty-month sentence coincides  with the  statutory\n\nmandatory  minimum sentence  for  his offense,  and that  the\n\ndistrict  court erred in failing to find that he is eligible,\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C.    3553(f) and U.S.S.G.   5C1.2,  for a\n\nlesser sentence within his guideline sentencing range of 57 -\n\n71 months.  We disagree.\n\n          As  we  read the  record,  the  district court  was\n\nwilling to assume its  authority to impose a  lesser sentence\n\nbut  determined that  a sixty-month sentence  was appropriate\n\ngiven   the  statutory   factors  of   deterrence   and  just\n\npunishment.     See   18  U.S.C.      3553(a).     Under  the\r                               \n\ncircumstances, the sentence imposed was a legitimate exercise\n\nof the district court's discretion and is unreviewable.
