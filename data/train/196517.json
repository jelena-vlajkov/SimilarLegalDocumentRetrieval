His  parents and\r\n\nfour siblings live  here.1  Petitioner completed  high school and\r\n\none year of  college.  He  wed a United  States citizen, but  the\r\n\nmarriage did not last.  He  has a son by another woman.   His son\r\n\nlives  in  the  United States,  but  not  with  petitioner    and\r\n\npetitioner  does  not   support  the  boy  on  a  regular  basis.\r\n\nPetitioner's  overall  work  record  is  spotty.    He  currently\r\n\noperates a hair-styling salon in Springfield, Massachusetts.\r\n\n          Petitioner  is no stranger to the legal system.  In May\r\n\nof 1991,  New  York authorities  charged  him with  assault  with\r\n\nintent to  cause serious harm,  criminal possession of  a weapon,\r\n\nand menacing.  About three weeks thereafter, the police  arrested\r\n\nhim  for jumping  the  turnstiles on  the  New York  City  subway\r\n\nsystem.  Initially,  he failed to respond to these charges.  When\r\n\nhe appeared two years later   doubtless prompted by his desire to\r\n\navoid looming deportation   the court reduced the charges arising\r\n\nout of the first  incident to a single  count of simple  assault.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1His  parents, a  brother,  and a  sister are  United States\r\ncitizens.  His other two siblings have permanent resident status.\r\nSome relatives still live in Jamaica.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nPetitioner pled guilty  both to  this reduced charge  and to  the\r\n\nturnstile-jumping  charge.     The   court  imposed   a  one-year\r\n\nconditional  discharge in  respect to  the former  and a  fine in\r\n\nrespect to the latter.\r\n\n          Another  brush with the law proved to be a catalyst for\r\n\ndeportation proceedings.  On October 13, 1991, Springfield police\r\n\nofficers found  petitioner (who was carrying false identification\r\n\npapers) in possession of  an unlicensed handgun.  He  pled guilty\r\n\nto a  weapons-possession charge  on January  13, 1992,  using his\r\n\npseudonym (\"Richard  Dave Gordon\"),  and spent several  months in\r\n\njail.   On February 4,  1992, the Immigration  and Naturalization\r\n\nService (INS) instituted deportation proceedings.\r\n\n          During  the pendency of the proceedings, petitioner had\r\n\nanother  close  encounter with  the law.    On December  2, 1992,\r\n\nSpringfield  authorities charged  him  with  assaulting a  police\r\n\nofficer.    The facts  surrounding  that incident  are  less than\r\n\npellucid.   The  police officer's  arrest  report states  that he\r\n\nrestrained petitioner after petitioner made a threatening gesture\r\n\nin  response to  an inquiry,  and that  petitioner then  hit him.\r\n\nPetitioner categorically  denies this  account, and says  that he\r\n\nneither  threatened nor  struck  the officer.    On the  date  of\r\n\npetitioner's deportation  hearing, the  assault charge  was still\r\n\npending,  and  the  record   reveals  no  definitive  disposition\r\n\n(although,  at  oral  argument  before us,  petitioner's  counsel\r\n\nrepresented that the charge is now by the boards).\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          At this juncture, we temporarily shift our focus to the\r\n\nstatutory scheme.  Petitioner's conviction on the firearms charge\r\n\nrendered him deportable under section 241 of the  Immigration and\r\n\nNationality  Act (INA),  8 U.S.C.    1251.2   Confronted  by this\r\n\nstatute, petitioner attempted to confess and avoid:   he conceded\r\n\ndeportability,  but sought  an adjustment  of status under  INA  \r\n\n245(a),  8 U.S.C.   1255(a).3  This course was theoretically open\r\n\nbecause, under the immigration  laws, the grounds for deportation\r\n\nare  not congruent  with those  for exclusion  of aliens.   Thus,\r\n\npetitioner's firearms conviction rendered him deportable, but not\r\n\nper se excludable.   Compare 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(C) with  id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1182(a) (listing grounds for exclusion).\r\n\n          Generally  speaking, resident aliens who are subject to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The statute provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n               Any alien who at any time after entry is\r\n          convicted  under  any   law  of   purchasing,\r\n          selling,   offering  for   sale,  exchanging,\r\n          using, owning,  possessing, or carrying . . .\r\n          any weapon,  part,  or accessory  which is  a\r\n          firearm  or  destructive  device  .  .  .  in\r\n          violation of any law is deportable.\r\n\n8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(C) (1994).\r\n\n     3The statute provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n               The status of an alien who was inspected\r\n          and  admitted  or  paroled  into  the  United\r\n          States  may  be  adjusted  by   the  Attorney\r\n          General,  in  his discretion  and  under such\r\n          regulations as he  may prescribe, to that  of\r\n          an  alien  lawfully  admitted  for  permanent\r\n          residence  [subject   to  certain  enumerated\r\n          conditions not relevant here].\r\n\n8 U.S.C.   1255(a) (1994).\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nexclusion upon leaving and attempting to reenter the country  may\r\n\napply for waivers of inadmissibility under INA   212(c), 8 U.S.C.\r\n\n   1182(c).4   Section  212(c) waivers  are equally  available to\r\n\naliens  in  deportation proceedings  as  long as  the  ground for\r\n\ndeportation is also a stated ground for exclusion.  See Campos v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nINS, 961 F.2d 309, 313 (1st Cir. 1992).  But such waivers are not\r             \r\n\navailable to  aliens in  deportation proceedings when  the ground\r\n\nfor deportation is  not also a stated ground for  exclusion.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at 316.\r             \r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n          Petitioner's case falls between these stools.   Lacking\r\n\nthe  foundational  prerequisite  for  seeking  a  section  212(c)\r\n\nwaiver, he opted to  use an application for adjustment  of status\r\n\nunder  section 245(a)  as an  alternate vehicle.   See  Matter of\r                                                                           \r\n\nRainford,  Interim Dec.  No. 3191,  at 6 (BIA  1992) (authorizing\r                  \r\n\nstatus-adjustment applications  in such circumstances).   The INS\r\n\nacknowledges  that he is eligible to be considered for adjustment\r\n\nof status under section  245(a).  Whether he deserves  the relief\r\n\nis a different  story.  On that score, an  immigration judge (IJ)\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The statute provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n               Aliens  lawfully admitted  for permanent\r\n          residence  who  temporarily proceeded  abroad\r\n          voluntarily  and   not  under  an   order  of\r\n          deportation,  and  who  are  returning  to  a\r\n          lawful   unrelinquished  domicile   of  seven\r\n          consecutive  years, may  be  admitted in  the\r\n          discretion  of  the Attorney  General without\r\n          regard   to  [many   of   the   grounds   for\r\n          exclusion].\r\n\n8 U.S.C.   1182(c) (1994).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ninitially  considered and  denied  petitioner's  application  for\r\n\nadjustment  of  status.    He explained  that  a  section  245(a)\r\n\nadjustment  is a  discretionary  remedy; that  to receive  such a\r\n\nbenefice  an  otherwise deportable  alien  must  show unusual  or\r\n\noutstanding  equities  sufficient  to  overbalance  the  negative\r\n\nfactor(s) on  which the finding of deportability rests; and that,\r\n\nin   petitioner's   case,   the  equities   did   not  adequately\r\n\npreponderate in his favor.\r\n\n          Petitioner appealed.   See 8 C.F.R.    3.1(b)(2) (1995)\r                                              \r\n\n(providing  for  administrative appeals  of  such  orders).   The\r\n\nBoard,  exercising de novo review,  see Gouveia v.  INS, 980 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n814,   817  (1st  Cir.  1992),  denied  relief.    In  its  view,\r\n\npetitioner's  strong points, e.g., his  family ties to the United\r\n\nStates, his protracted residence here, and his belated efforts at\r\n\nrehabilitation, did  not overcome  the discredit inherent  in his\r\n\ncriminal record.\r\n\n                                IV\r                                          IV\r\n\n          We do  not print  on  a pristine  page.   The  IJ  made\r\n\nextensive  findings  in  this  matter,  and  the  Board  issued a\r\n\ncomprehensive decision  adopting many  of those findings.   After\r\n\ncareful  perscrutation of the record, we discern no fatal flaw in\r\n\nthe  Board's  rationale.     Thus,  we   uphold  the  denial   of\r\n\npetitioner's request for adjustment of status for essentially the\r\n\nreasons stated by the Board, adding relatively few comments.\r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r                                            \r\n\n          The  decision  to  grant  or deny  an  application  for\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nadjustment  of status  is  one  that  rests within  the  informed\r\n\ndiscretion  of the Attorney General, see 8 U.S.C.   1255(a), and,\r                                                  \r\n\nby delegation, within the informed discretion of the Board.  As a\r\n\nresult, the  ambit of  judicial review is  tightly circumscribed.\r\n\nCourts are entitled to  probe the Board's discretionary decisions\r\n\nonly  to the  extent  necessary to  ascertain  whether the  Board\r\n\nmisread  the  law  or  otherwise  misused its  discretion.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMartinez v. INS, 970 F.2d 973, 974 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                         \r\n\n          To be sure, adjudicatory tribunals can exceed grants of\r\n\ndiscretion       even  ringing   grants  of   broad,  essentially\r\n\nstandardless discretion   in  various ways.  We have  pointed out\r\n\nthat courts can abuse discretion in any of three aspects, namely,\r\n\nby neglecting to consider a significant factor that appropriately\r\n\nbears  on the discretionary  decision, by  attaching weight  to a\r\n\nfactor  that does not appropriately  bear on the  decision, or by\r\n\nassaying  all  the  proper  factors  and no  improper  ones,  but\r\n\nnonetheless  making a  clear judgmental  error in  weighing them.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States v. Roberts,  978 F.2d 17,  21 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1992); Independent Oil &amp; Chem. Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter\r                                                                           \r\n\n&amp;  Gamble Mfg. Co.,  864 F.2d 927,  929 (1st Cir.  1988).  Like a\r                            \r\n\ncourt, so, too, an  administrative adjudicative body charged with\r\n\nmaking  a discretionary decision can stray beyond the pale in any\r\n\nof these three ways.\r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r                                            \r\n\n          Petitioner asserts that the Board abused its discretion\r\n\nin all the respects that we have mentioned.  We deal briefly with\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\neach facet of this trifurcated assertion.\r\n\n                                1.\r                                          1.\r                                            \r\n\n          First  and foremost,  petitioner  asseverates that  the\r\n\nBoard improperly failed  to consider all the factors favorable to\r\n\nhim.   In particular, citing Matter of Marin,  16 I &amp; N Dec. 581,\r                                                      \r\n\n584-85  (BIA 1978),  a section  212(c) waiver case,  he maintains\r\n\nthat the Board  unnecessarily limited the  data it considered  in\r\n\nassessing the equities underpinning his request for adjustment of\r\n\nstatus.\r\n\n          In the  section 212(c) milieu, the  Board and reviewing\r\n\ncourts  habitually  refer  to  a   stock  list  of  factors  that\r\n\npotentially  inform   the  equities  attendant   to  a   waiver.5\r\n\nPetitioner asks us  to transplant this list wholesale and mandate\r\n\nits use in connection  with status-adjustment applications  under\r\n\nsection 245(a).  This importuning reaches too far: fairly viewed,\r\n\nit  solicits  the  overruling,  sub  silentio,  of  this  court's\r                                                       \r\n\ndecision in Campos.   There,  we held that  the Attorney  General\r                            \r\n\ncould rationally decide not to  make section 212(c) waiver relief\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5These factors include:\r\n\n               (1)  family  ties   within  the   United\r\n          States; (2) residence of long duration in the\r\n          United  States; (3)  evidence of  hardship to\r\n          petitioner   or    petitioner's   family   if\r\n          deportation occurs; (4) service in the United\r\n          States Armed Forces; (5) a  steady employment\r\n          history;  (6)  the existence  of  property or\r\n          business ties in  this country; (7) community\r\n          service;  (8)  rehabilitation;  and  (9)  any\r\n          other evidence fairly indicating petitioner's\r\n          good character.\r\n\nGouveia, 980 F.2d at 816 (citing Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. at 584-85).\r                                                \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\navailable to aliens convicted  of firearms offenses that rendered\r\n\nthem deportable  but not  automatically excludable.   See Campos,\r                                                                          \r\n\n961 F.2d  at 316.  In so  holding, we made it  crystal clear that\r\n\nthe  section 212(c) waiver provision,  8 U.S.C.   1182(c), \"could\r\n\nnot be utilized to  waive all grounds of deportability,  but only\r                                       \r\n\nthose grounds  of deportability having a  corresponding ground of\r\n\nexcludability . . . .\"  Id. at 313 (emphasis in original).\r                                     \r\n\n          Petitioner  today tries  to bring  in through  the back\r\n\ndoor the same iteration that the Campos court barred at the front\r                                                 \r\n\ndoor.  His  core argument is that the Board abused its discretion\r\n\nby  not  applying  the  section  212(c)  waiver  criteria  to  an\r\n\nadjustment of status case.  Were we to accept this construct,  we\r\n\nwould  effectively  require  INS  to afford  deportable  but  not\r\n\nnecessarily  excludable aliens  (like petitioner)  relief exactly\r\n\nequivalent  to that available under  8 U.S.C.    1182(c).  But we\r\n\nexpressly  declined to dictate such a result when we concluded in\r\n\nCampos  that  the law  did  not  make  waiver of  inadmissibility\r                \r\n\navailable to all deportable aliens.\r\n\n          We see  no reason to revisit  the matter.  When  all is\r\n\nsaid  and done,  waiver  of inadmissibility  is an  extraordinary\r\n\ndiscretionary remedy that Congress,  in enacting section  212(c),\r\n\nmade available primarily to assist excludable aliens who had been\r\n\nlong-term residents of  this country.   See Campos,  961 F.2d  at\r                                                            \r\n\n316.   Congress painstakingly  set the  limits  within which  the\r\n\nwaiver  proviso is to  operate.  The  courts have  no roving writ\r\n\nthat enables  them to  refashion the legislature's  handiwork and\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nstretch the statute to  cover all cases  in which a person  might\r\n\nsuffer deportation as a result of his own crimes.6\r\n\n          In any event, the  argument that petitioner advances is\r\n\nlargely academic in the  circumstances at hand.  Even  in section\r\n\n212(c)  waiver cases,  the Marin  factors are  only illustrative.\r                                          \r\n\nThey do not comprise an invariable checklist.  See Hazime v. INS,\r                                                                          \r\n\n17 F.3d 136, 140 (6th  Cir.) (explaining that the Board  need not\r\n\naddress all the  Marin criteria in reaching its  decision), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied,  115 S.  Ct. 331  (1994).   So  long as  the Board  gives\r                \r\n\nadequate  consideration  to the  equities supporting  a favorable\r\n\nexercise  of discretion,  it  discharges its  duty under  section\r\n\n212(c).  See id.; see also Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. at 585.\r                                          \r\n\n          In  this instance,  the administrative record  makes it\r\n\nplain that  the  Board paid  satisfactory  heed to  the  relevant\r\n\nfactors.   It explicitly noted petitioner's  length of residence,\r\n\nhis family  ties, his tentative steps  toward rehabilitation, and\r\n\nthe  conceivable  hardships (including  the  likely  loss of  his\r\n\nproprietary interest in a start-up business).  Petitioner offered\r\n\nno evidence  regarding military service  or community activities.\r\n\nThus,  the Board  in effect  considered all  the pertinent  Marin\r                                                                           \r\n\nfactors  despite  the  absence  of  any  obligation  to   do  so.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6We note,  too, that  petitioner's construct not  only would\r\noverrun the limits applicable to section 212(c) waivers, but also\r\nwould  serve  to  create   two  different  adjustment  of  status\r\nstandards:     one  for   criminals  ineligible  for   waiver  of\r\ninadmissibility,  and another for  students, temporary employees,\r\nand the myriad of non-resident immigrants eligible for adjustment\r\nof status.   We think the Board's  decision to preserve the unity\r\nof its status-adjustment standard is eminently reasonable, and we\r\ndiscern no abuse of discretion here.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nPetitioner has no valid ground for his Marin-based complaint.\r                                                      \r\n\n                                2.\r                                          2.\r                                            \r\n\n          Next,  petitioner  posits  that  the Board  pondered  a\r\n\nfactor  that  should  have  been  excluded  from  the  decisional\r\n\ncalculus:   his  1992 arrest  for allegedly  assaulting a  police\r\n\nofficer.  He pegs this claim on Matter of  Arreguin, Interim Dec.\r                                                             \r\n\nNo. 3247  (BIA 1995), a case  decided four days  before the Board\r\n\ndecided  Henry's appeal, and  asserts that Arreguin  stands for a\r                                                             \r\n\nblack-letter rule proscribing consideration of arrest reports.\r\n\n          We  begin with basics.   The law recognizes  that in an\r\n\nagency  as large  as  the INS  different  officials may  not  act\r\n\nidentically in every case.   This lack of complete  uniformity is\r\n\nunavoidable   after  all, administrators are not automatons   and\r\n\ndoes   not,  in   an   of  itself,   invalidate  agency   action.\r\n\nNonetheless, agencies do not have carte blanche.  While a certain\r\n\namount of asymmetry  is lawful,  see Davila-Bardales  v. INS,  27\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1,  5 (1st Cir. 1994);  Puerto Rican Cement Co.  v.

See, e.g.,  Congreso de\r                                                                           \r\n\nUniones Industriales de P.R.  v.

The  precept  demands,  however,   that  if  the\r\n\n\"administrative agency decides  to depart significantly from  its\r\n\nown precedent, it  must confront the  issue squarely and  explain\r\n\nwhy the departure is reasonable.\"  Davila-Bardales, 27 F.3d at 4.\r                                                            \r\n\nIn other words, administrative agencies must apply the same basic\r\n\nrules to all  similarly situated supplicants.   An agency  cannot\r\n\nmerely flit serendipitously from case to case, like a bee buzzing\r\n\nfrom flower to flower, making up the rules as it goes along.\r\n\n          It is against  this chiseled backdrop  that we turn  to\r\n\nArreguin.  There, the  Board reversed an IJ's refusal to  grant a\r                  \r\n\nsection  212(c) waiver to an  alien convicted of  playing a minor\r\n\nrole in a marijuana  importing scheme.  In denying relief, the IJ\r\n\nconsidered  a  twelve-year-old  arrest record  on  charges (later\r\n\ndropped)  of smuggling  aliens  into  the  United  States.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nArreguin,  supra,  at  8.     While  the  Board   sanctioned  the\r                          \r\n\nadmissibility of  the arrest  record into evidence,  it explained\r\n\nthat, under  the circumstances,  it would  give the  record scant\r\n\nweight.  See id.  Petitioner maintains that Arreguin  establishes\r                                                              \r\n\na black-letter  rule gainsaying reliance on  arrest records, and,\r\n\nthus,  that consistency  of  precedent requires  reversal of  the\r\n\ninstant order.  We  demur:  the Board's decision in  Arreguin did\r                                                                       \r\n\nnot require it ipso  facto to disregard altogether the  report of\r                                    \r\n\npetitioner's 1992 arrest.\r\n\n          The   principal   problem  presented   by  petitioner's\r\n\nprohibitory proposition is Arreguin itself.  The case simply does\r                                             \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nnot  announce  the rigid  rule  that petitioner  ascribes  to it.\r\n\nThere, the  Board approved the  IJ's admission of  a particularly\r\n\nvulnerable arrest  record into evidence,  and agreed that  it had\r\n\nsome  probative value.  See  id.  The  difficulty was that, under\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe  circumstances of the particular case, the IJ gave the record\r                                                   \r\n\nmore weight  than it  deserved, and, concomitantly,  neglected to\r\n\ngive  full  effect  to  many positive  elements  buttressing  the\r\n\npetitioner's case.  Properly read, Arreguin implicates matters of\r                                                     \r\n\ndegree, explaining  the relative weight  that should be  given to\r\n\narrest  records.   Nothing  in  the opinion  suggests  that, when\r\n\nfacing a closer balance of equities, the Board might not properly\r\n\ndecide  that a  record  of arrest  tips  the scales  against  the\r\n\nbestowal of discretionary relief.\r\n\n          Nor  does  Arreguin  represent an  alteration  of prior\r                                       \r\n\nprecedent.  The  traditional rules  of evidence do  not apply  in\r\n\nimmigration hearings, see,  e.g., Espinoza v.  INS, 45 F.3d  308,\r                                                            \r\n\n310  (9th Cir. 1995),  and arrest reports  historically have been\r\n\nadmissible  in such proceedings,  see Paredes-Urrestarazu v. INS,\r                                                                          \r\n\n36 F.3d  801, 813  (9th Cir.  1994) (holding  that the  Board may\r\n\nentertain  arrest  records  as  evidence).   Moreover,  while  an\r\n\narrest, without more, is  simply an unproven charge, the  fact of\r\n\nthe arrest, and its attendant circumstances, often have probative\r\n\nvalue  in immigration proceedings.   See, e.g., id.  at 810 (\"The\r                                                             \r\n\nfact  of arrest, insofar as it bears  upon whether an alien might\r\n\nhave engaged in underlying conduct and insofar as facts probative\r\n\nof an  alien's `bad  character or undesirability  as a  permanent\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nresident'  arise  from  the   arrest  itself,  plainly  can  have\r\n\nrelevance\" in  discretionary relief).  Arreguin  does not purport\r                                                         \r\n\nto command  any deviation from  these venerable  practices or  to\r\n\nprohibit the  type of  recourse that  the Board historically  has\r\n\nmade to arrest records.\r\n\n          In fine, the lesson of Arreguin is that, when the Board\r                                                   \r\n\nappraises the  considerations on both sides  of the discretionary\r\n\nbalance to  determine  whether they  are  in equipoise,  it  will\r\n\naccord virtually no weight to an arrest record remote in time and\r\n\nunsupported by  corroborating evidence.  See  Arreguin, supra, at\r                                                                       \r\n\n8.  Here,  the Board adumbrated that  rather unremarkable lesson.\r\n\nIt  considered the 1992 arrest  report in a  limited way, without\r\n\ngiving  excessive  weight  to it.    It  was entitled  to  do so,\r\n\nArreguin notwithstanding.7\r                  \r\n\n                                3.\r                                          3.\r                                            \r\n\n          In  his most  broad-gauged foray,  petitioner maintains\r\n\nthat the Board  drew the  wrong conclusions from  the factors  it\r\n\nconsidered.    In  this  context, petitioner  complains  that  he\r\n\ndemonstrated strong familial ties to the United States, long-term\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7Petitioner's reliance  on Arreguin  is misplaced for  other\r                                                  \r\nreasons as  well.  For  one thing,  Arreguin is a  section 212(c)\r                                                      \r\nwaiver case, and  there is  no requirement that  the Board  treat\r\nsection 245(a)  status adjustment cases  like waiver cases.   For\r\nanother  thing,  Henry  himself  offered  the  arrest  record  as\r\nevidence  before  the IJ,  apparently as  part  of an  attempt to\r\nexplain away the  incident in question.  It ill  behooves  him to\r\ncomplain on  appeal that the Board  should not have paid  heed to\r\nevidence  that he proffered.   See Johnson v.  INS, 971 F.2d 340,\r                                                            \r\n343 (9th  Cir. 1992) (recognizing  that the  doctrine of  invited\r\nerror precludes  a petitioner from  challenging the admissibility\r\nof evidence she proffered at her deportation hearing).\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nresidency here, and hardship in the event of deportation.  These,\r\n\nhe  continues,  are the  very factors  the  Board has  required a\r\n\npetitioner  to  demonstrate  in  order  to  make  the showing  of\r\n\noutstanding   equities  necessary  to  overcome  strong  negative\r\n\nfactors.  See Matter of Arai, 13 I &amp; N Dec. 494, 496 (BIA 1970).\r                                      \r\n\n          Petitioner's argument misapprehends  both the nature of\r\n\nstatus adjustment and the role of judicial review.  Adjustment of\r\n\nstatus  is  not an  entitlement,  but,  rather, an  extraordinary\r\n\nremedy.  The Board need not make the anodyne available to all who\r\n\ntheoretically  qualify.     Indeed,  the  Attorney  General   has\r\n\ncautioned that  the Board's regimen  in Arai \"does  not establish\r                                                      \r\n\nrigid  rules which  deny  to immigration  judges the  flexibility\r\n\nnecessary  to carry  out their  duty to  analyze  sensitively the\r\n\ncompeting factors in each particular case.\"  Matter of Blas, 15 I\r                                                                     \r\n\n&amp; N  Dec. 626, 641  (Atty.

Thus, status adjustment is quintessentially a matter\r\n\n\"of administrative discretion.\"  Arai, 13 I &amp; N Dec. at 496.\r                                               \r\n\n          Moreover,  when a  matter is  committed by  law to  the\r\n\nBoard's  sound  discretion,  a   reviewing  court  plays  a  very\r\n\nrestricted role in overseeing the administrative exercise of that\r\n\ndiscretion.    So  long as  the  Board  follows  its own  settled\r\n\nprinciples and provides a  reasoned explanation for its decision,\r\n\njudicial review  is at an  end.   See Gouveia, 980  F.2d at  818;\r                                                       \r\n\nMartinez, 970 F.2d at 974.\r                  \r\n\n          Of  course,  discretion  is  not to  be  confused  with\r\n\nimperiousness.  When  the Board rejects a request  for adjustment\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nof status, it must articulate its reasons for taking that action,\r\n\nand those reasons must be  plausible.  Nonetheless, the existence\r\n\nof favorable  information under each  of the three  Arai headings\r                                                                  \r\n\ndoes  not require the Board  to grant adjustment  of status.

As we have written in an  analogous\r              \r\n\nsetting, \"even the presence  of preponderant equities or equities\r\n\nthat in the abstract could qualify  as `unusual' or `outstanding'\r\n\ndoes not compel the Board to grant relief.\"  Gouveia, 980 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n816.\r\n\n          Here, the Board offered  an adequate explanation of why\r\n\nit   believed  that  petitioner's   favorable  factors  were  not\r\n\nsufficiently  compelling to  justify adjustment  of status.   The\r\n\nBoard's  decision  focused on  the  seriousness  of the  firearms\r\n\nconviction.  It observed that  both petitioner and his  companion\r\n\nwere armed  at the time  of the arrest,  and that petitioner  had\r\n\nmaintained a  deception by  utilizing a pseudonym  throughout the\r\n\ncriminal  proceedings.   The  Board also  looked to  petitioner's\r\n\nhistory of altercations with  the law, particularly his tardiness\r\n\nin acknowledging his crimes in New York.  It took due note of the\r\n\nfavorable factors  advanced  by  petitioner  but  determined,  on\r\n\nbalance, that these points were not sufficiently robust  to yield\r\n\nthe kind  of unusual  and outstanding  equitable case that  would\r\n\nwarrant   an  adjustment  of   status.    In   short,  the  Board\r\n\npersuasively  explained  the premises  on  which  it declined  to\r\n\nexercise  its discretion.   That  ends the  matter.   A reviewing\r\n\ncourt may not reweigh the equities afresh.  See Gouveia, 980 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nat 819.\r\n\n                                V\r                                          V\r\n\n          We  need  go no  further.   Adjustment  of status  is a\r\n\ndiscretionary  remedy.   Although the  Board could  have afforded\r\n\npetitioner this remedy,  it chose not to do so.  That is both the\r\n\nBoard's prerogative  and its  duty.  In  the absence of  either a\r\n\nmistake  of  law or  a palpable  abuse  of discretion,  we cannot\r\n\nsubstitute our judgment for that of the Board.\r\n\n          The  petition for review is  denied and dismissed.

Sec. 1105a(a) (1994), petitioner Warren Henry seeks judicial review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (the Board) denying his request for adjustment of status and directing his deportation.  We dismiss the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Petitioner, a 24-year-old Jamaican national, has resided in the United States since late 1984.  His parents and four siblings live here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Petitioner completed high school and one year of college.  He wed a United States citizen, but the marriage did not last.  He has a son by another woman.  His son lives in the United States, but not with petitioner--and petitioner does not support the boy on a regular basis.  Petitioner's overall work record is spotty.  He currently operates a hair-styling salon in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner is no stranger to the legal system.  In May of 1991, New York authorities charged him with assault with intent to cause serious harm, criminal possession of a weapon, and menacing.  About three weeks thereafter, the police arrested him for jumping the turnstiles on the New York City subway system.  Initially, he failed to respond to these charges.  When he appeared two years later--doubtless prompted by his desire to avoid looming deportation--the court reduced the charges arising out of the first incident to a single count of simple assault.  Petitioner pled guilty both to this reduced charge and to the turnstile-jumping charge.  The court imposed a one-year conditional discharge in respect to the former and a fine in respect to the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another brush with the law proved to be a catalyst for deportation proceedings.  On October 13, 1991, Springfield police officers found petitioner (who was carrying false identification papers) in possession of an unlicensed handgun.  He pled guilty to a weapons-possession charge on January 13, 1992, using his pseudonym (\"Richard Dave Gordon\"), and spent several months in jail.  On February 4, 1992, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) instituted deportation proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pendency of the proceedings, petitioner had another close encounter with the law.  On December 2, 1992, Springfield authorities charged him with assaulting a police officer.  The facts surrounding that incident are less than pellucid.  The police officer's arrest report states that he restrained petitioner after petitioner made a threatening gesture in response to an inquiry, and that petitioner then hit him.  Petitioner categorically denies this account, and says that he neither threatened nor struck the officer.  On the date of petitioner's deportation hearing, the assault charge was still pending, and the record reveals no definitive disposition (although, at oral argument before us, petitioner's counsel represented that the charge is now by the boards).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this juncture, we temporarily shift our focus to the statutory scheme.  Petitioner's conviction on the firearms charge rendered him deportable under section 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Confronted by this statute, petitioner attempted to confess and avoid:  he conceded deportability, but sought an adjustment of status under INA Sec. 245(a), 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1255(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This course was theoretically open because, under the immigration laws, the grounds for deportation are not congruent with those for exclusion of aliens.  Thus, petitioner's firearms conviction rendered him deportable, but not per se excludable.  Compare 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(2)(C) with id. Sec. 1182(a) (listing grounds for exclusion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, resident aliens who are subject to exclusion upon leaving and attempting to reenter the country may apply for waivers of inadmissibility under INA Sec. 212(c), 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Section 212(c) waivers are equally available to aliens in deportation proceedings as long as the ground for deportation is also a stated ground for exclusion.  See Campos v. INS, 961 F.2d 309, 313 (1st Cir.1992).  But such waivers are not available to aliens in deportation proceedings when the ground for deportation is not also a stated ground for exclusion.  See id. at 316.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's case falls between these stools.  Lacking the foundational prerequisite for seeking a section 212(c) waiver, he opted to use an application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) as an alternate vehicle.  See Matter of Rainford, Interim Dec.  No. 3191, at 6 (BIA 1992) (authorizing status-adjustment applications in such circumstances).  The INS acknowledges that he is eligible to be considered for adjustment of status under section 245(a).  Whether he deserves the relief is a different story.  On that score, an immigration judge (IJ) initially considered and denied petitioner's application for adjustment of status.  He explained that a section 245(a) adjustment is a discretionary remedy;  that to receive such a benefice an otherwise deportable alien must show unusual or outstanding equities sufficient to overbalance the negative factor(s) on which the finding of deportability rests;  and that, in petitioner's case, the equities did not adequately preponderate in his favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner appealed.  See 8 C.F.R. Sec. 3.1(b)(2) (1995) (providing for administrative appeals of such orders).  The Board, exercising de novo review, see Gouveia v. INS, 980 F.2d 814, 817 (1st Cir.1992), denied relief.  In its view, petitioner's strong points, e.g., his family ties to the United States, his protracted residence here, and his belated efforts at rehabilitation, did not overcome the discredit inherent in his criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not print on a pristine page.  The IJ made extensive findings in this matter, and the Board issued a comprehensive decision adopting many of those findings.  After careful perscrutation of the record, we discern no fatal flaw in the Board's rationale.  Thus, we uphold the denial of petitioner's request for adjustment of status for essentially the reasons stated by the Board, adding relatively few comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to grant or deny an application for adjustment of status is one that rests within the informed discretion of the Attorney General, see 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1255(a), and, by delegation, within the informed discretion of the Board.  As a result, the ambit of judicial review is tightly circumscribed.  Courts are entitled to probe the Board's discretionary decisions only to the extent necessary to ascertain whether the Board misread the law or otherwise misused its discretion.  See Martinez v. INS, 970 F.2d 973, 974 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, adjudicatory tribunals can exceed grants of discretion--even ringing grants of broad, essentially standardless discretion--in various ways.  We have pointed out that courts can abuse discretion in any of three aspects, namely, by neglecting to consider a significant factor that appropriately bears on the discretionary decision, by attaching weight to a factor that does not appropriately bear on the decision, or by assaying all the proper factors and no improper ones, but nonetheless making a clear judgmental error in weighing them.  See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992);  Independent Oil &amp; Chem.  Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.1988).  Like a court, so, too, an administrative adjudicative body charged with making a discretionary decision can stray beyond the pale in any of these three ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner asserts that the Board abused its discretion in all the respects that we have mentioned.  We deal briefly with each facet of this trifurcated assertion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First and foremost, petitioner asseverates that the Board improperly failed to consider all the factors favorable to him.  In particular, citing Matter of Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. 581, 584-85 (BIA 1978), a section 212(c) waiver case, he maintains that the Board unnecessarily limited the data it considered in assessing the equities underpinning his request for adjustment of status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the section 212(c) milieu, the Board and reviewing courts habitually refer to a stock list of factors that potentially inform the equities attendant to a waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Petitioner asks us to transplant this list wholesale and mandate its use in connection with status-adjustment applications under section 245(a). This importuning reaches too far:  fairly viewed, it solicits the overruling, sub silentio, of this court's decision in Campos.   There, we held that the Attorney General could rationally decide not to make section 212(c) waiver relief available to aliens convicted of firearms offenses that rendered them deportable but not automatically excludable.  See Campos, 961 F.2d at 316.   In so holding, we made it crystal clear that the section 212(c) waiver provision, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c), \"could not be utilized to waive all grounds of deportability, but only those grounds of deportability having a corresponding ground of excludability....\"  Id. at 313 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner today tries to bring in through the back door the same iteration that the Campos court barred at the front door.  His core argument is that the Board abused its discretion by not applying the section 212(c) waiver criteria to an adjustment of status case.  Were we to accept this construct, we would effectively require INS to afford deportable but not necessarily excludable aliens (like petitioner) relief exactly equivalent to that available under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c).  But we expressly declined to dictate such a result when we concluded in Campos that the law did not make waiver of inadmissibility available to all deportable aliens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no reason to revisit the matter.  When all is said and done, waiver of inadmissibility is an extraordinary discretionary remedy that Congress, in enacting section 212(c), made available primarily to assist excludable aliens who had been long-term residents of this country.  See Campos, 961 F.2d at 316.   Congress painstakingly set the limits within which the waiver proviso is to operate.  The courts have no roving writ that enables them to refashion the legislature's handiwork and stretch the statute to cover all cases in which a person might suffer deportation as a result of his own crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the argument that petitioner advances is largely academic in the circumstances at hand.  Even in section 212(c) waiver cases, the Marin factors are only illustrative.  They do not comprise an invariable checklist.  See Hazime v. INS, 17 F.3d 136, 140 (6th Cir.)  (explaining that the Board need not address all the Marin criteria in reaching its decision), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 331, 130 L.Ed.2d 289 (1994).  So long as the Board gives adequate consideration to the equities supporting a favorable exercise of discretion, it discharges its duty under section 212(c).  See id.;   see also Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. at 585.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the administrative record makes it plain that the Board paid satisfactory heed to the relevant factors.  It explicitly noted petitioner's length of residence, his family ties, his tentative steps toward rehabilitation, and the conceivable hardships (including the likely loss of his proprietary interest in a start-up business).  Petitioner offered no evidence regarding military service or community activities.  Thus, the Board in effect considered all the pertinent Marin factors despite the absence of any obligation to do so.  Petitioner has no valid ground for his Marin-based complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, petitioner posits that the Board pondered a factor that should have been excluded from the decisional calculus:  his 1992 arrest for allegedly assaulting a police officer.  He pegs this claim on Matter of Arreguin, Interim Dec.  No. 3247 (BIA 1995), a case decided four days before the Board decided Henry's appeal, and asserts that Arreguin stands for a black-letter rule proscribing consideration of arrest reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with basics.  The law recognizes that in an agency as large as the INS different officials may not act identically in every case.  This lack of complete uniformity is unavoidable--after all, administrators are not automatons--and does not, in an of itself, invalidate agency action.  Nonetheless, agencies do not have carte blanche.  While a certain amount of asymmetry is lawful, see Davila-Bardales v. INS, 27 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1994);  Puerto Rican Cement Co. v. EPA, 889 F.2d 292, 299 (1st Cir.1989), an agency may not \"adopt[ ] significantly inconsistent policies that result in the creation of conflicting lines of precedent governing the identical situation.\"  Davila-Bardales, 27 F.3d at 5 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear:  the precept counselling avoidance of inconsistent administrative policies does not freeze an agency's jurisprudence for all time.  See, e.g., Congreso de Uniones Industriales de P.R. v. NLRB, 966 F.2d 36, 39 (1st Cir.1992);  Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc. v. NLRB, 884 F.2d 34, 37 (1st Cir.1989).  The precept demands, however, that if the \"administrative agency decides to depart significantly from its own precedent, it must confront the issue squarely and explain why the departure is reasonable.\"  Davila-Bardales, 27 F.3d at 4.   In other words, administrative agencies must apply the same basic rules to all similarly situated supplicants.  An agency cannot merely flit serendipitously from case to case, like a bee buzzing from flower to flower, making up the rules as it goes along.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is against this chiseled backdrop that we turn to Arreguin.   There, the Board reversed an IJ's refusal to grant a section 212(c) waiver to an alien convicted of playing a minor role in a marijuana importing scheme.  In denying relief, the IJ considered a twelve-year-old arrest record on charges (later dropped) of smuggling aliens into the United States.  See Arreguin, supra, at 8.   While the Board sanctioned the admissibility of the arrest record into evidence, it explained that, under the circumstances, it would give the record scant weight.  See id.   Petitioner maintains that Arreguin establishes a black-letter rule gainsaying reliance on arrest records, and, thus, that consistency of precedent requires reversal of the instant order.  We demur:  the Board's decision in Arreguin did not require it ipso facto to disregard altogether the report of petitioner's 1992 arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal problem presented by petitioner's prohibitory proposition is Arreguin itself.  The case simply does not announce the rigid rule that petitioner ascribes to it.  There, the Board approved the IJ's admission of a particularly vulnerable arrest record into evidence, and agreed that it had some probative value.  See id.   The difficulty was that, under the circumstances of the particular case, the IJ gave the record more weight than it deserved, and, concomitantly, neglected to give full effect to many positive elements buttressing the petitioner's case.  Properly read, Arreguin implicates matters of degree, explaining the relative weight that should be given to arrest records.  Nothing in the opinion suggests that, when facing a closer balance of equities, the Board might not properly decide that a record of arrest tips the scales against the bestowal of discretionary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Arreguin represent an alteration of prior precedent.  The traditional rules of evidence do not apply in immigration hearings, see, e.g., Espinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir.1995), and arrest reports historically have been admissible in such proceedings, see Paredes-Urrestarazu v. INS, 36 F.3d 801, 813 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that the Board may entertain arrest records as evidence).  Moreover, while an arrest, without more, is simply an unproven charge, the fact of the arrest, and its attendant circumstances, often have probative value in immigration proceedings.  See, e.g., id. at 810 (\"The fact of arrest, insofar as it bears upon whether an alien might have engaged in underlying conduct and insofar as facts probative of an alien's 'bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident' arise from the arrest itself, plainly can have relevance\" in discretionary relief).  Arreguin does not purport to command any deviation from these venerable practices or to prohibit the type of recourse that the Board historically has made to arrest records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fine, the lesson of Arreguin is that, when the Board appraises the considerations on both sides of the discretionary balance to determine whether they are in equipoise, it will accord virtually no weight to an arrest record remote in time and unsupported by corroborating evidence.  See Arreguin, supra, at 8.   Here, the Board adumbrated that rather unremarkable lesson.  It considered the 1992 arrest report in a limited way, without giving excessive weight to it.  It was entitled to do so, Arreguin notwithstanding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his most broad-gauged foray, petitioner maintains that the Board drew the wrong conclusions from the factors it considered.  In this context, petitioner complains that he demonstrated strong familial ties to the United States, long-term residency here, and hardship in the event of deportation.  These, he continues, are the very factors the Board has required a petitioner to demonstrate in order to make the showing of outstanding equities necessary to overcome strong negative factors.  See Matter of Arai, 13 I &amp; N Dec. 494, 496 (BIA 1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's argument misapprehends both the nature of status adjustment and the role of judicial review.  Adjustment of status is not an entitlement, but, rather, an extraordinary remedy.  The Board need not make the anodyne available to all who theoretically qualify.  Indeed, the Attorney General has cautioned that the Board's regimen in Arai \"does not establish rigid rules which deny to immigration judges the flexibility necessary to carry out their duty to analyze sensitively the competing factors in each particular case.\"  Matter of Blas, 15 I &amp; N Dec. 626, 641 (Atty.Gen.1976), aff'd, 556 F.2d 586 (9th Cir.1977).  Thus, status adjustment is quintessentially a matter \"of administrative discretion.\"  Arai, 13 I &amp; N Dec. at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, when a matter is committed by law to the Board's sound discretion, a reviewing court plays a very restricted role in overseeing the administrative exercise of that discretion.  So long as the Board follows its own settled principles and provides a reasoned explanation for its decision, judicial review is at an end.  See Gouveia, 980 F.2d at 818;  Martinez, 970 F.2d at 974.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, discretion is not to be confused with imperiousness.  When the Board rejects a request for adjustment of status, it must articulate its reasons for taking that action, and those reasons must be plausible.  Nonetheless, the existence of favorable information under each of the three Arai headings does not require the Board to grant adjustment of status.  See Blas, 15 I &amp; N Dec. at 641.   As we have written in an analogous setting, \"even the presence of preponderant equities or equities that in the abstract could qualify as 'unusual' or 'outstanding' does not compel the Board to grant relief.\"  Gouveia, 980 F.2d at 816.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Board offered an adequate explanation of why it believed that petitioner's favorable factors were not sufficiently compelling to justify adjustment of status.  The Board's decision focused on the seriousness of the firearms conviction.  It observed that both petitioner and his companion were armed at the time of the arrest, and that petitioner had maintained a deception by utilizing a pseudonym throughout the criminal proceedings.  The Board also looked to petitioner's history of altercations with the law, particularly his tardiness in acknowledging his crimes in New York.  It took due note of the favorable factors advanced by petitioner but determined, on balance, that these points were not sufficiently robust to yield the kind of unusual and outstanding equitable case that would warrant an adjustment of status.  In short, the Board persuasively explained the premises on which it declined to exercise its discretion.  That ends the matter.  A reviewing court may not reweigh the equities afresh.  See Gouveia, 980 F.2d at 819.V</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Adjustment of status is a discretionary remedy.  Although the Board could have afforded petitioner this remedy, it chose not to do so.  That is both the Board's prerogative and its duty.  In the absence of either a mistake of law or a palpable abuse of discretion, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is denied and dismissed.

For another thing, Henry himself offered the arrest record as evidence before the IJ, apparently as part of an attempt to explain away the incident in question.  It ill behooves him to complain on appeal that the Board should not have paid heed to evidence that he proffered.  See Johnson v.

Sec. 1105a(a) (1994), petitioner Warren Henry seeks judicial review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (the Board) denying his request for adjustment of status and directing his deportation.  We dismiss the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Petitioner, a 24-year-old Jamaican national, has resided in the United States since late 1984.  His parents and four siblings live here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Petitioner completed high school and one year of college.  He wed a United States citizen, but the marriage did not last.  He has a son by another woman.  His son lives in the United States, but not with petitioner--and petitioner does not support the boy on a regular basis.  Petitioner's overall work record is spotty.  He currently operates a hair-styling salon in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner is no stranger to the legal system.  In May of 1991, New York authorities charged him with assault with intent to cause serious harm, criminal possession of a weapon, and menacing.  About three weeks thereafter, the police arrested him for jumping the turnstiles on the New York City subway system.  Initially, he failed to respond to these charges.  When he appeared two years later--doubtless prompted by his desire to avoid looming deportation--the court reduced the charges arising out of the first incident to a single count of simple assault.  Petitioner pled guilty both to this reduced charge and to the turnstile-jumping charge.  The court imposed a one-year conditional discharge in respect to the former and a fine in respect to the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another brush with the law proved to be a catalyst for deportation proceedings.  On October 13, 1991, Springfield police officers found petitioner (who was carrying false identification papers) in possession of an unlicensed handgun.  He pled guilty to a weapons-possession charge on January 13, 1992, using his pseudonym (\"Richard Dave Gordon\"), and spent several months in jail.  On February 4, 1992, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) instituted deportation proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pendency of the proceedings, petitioner had another close encounter with the law.  On December 2, 1992, Springfield authorities charged him with assaulting a police officer.  The facts surrounding that incident are less than pellucid.  The police officer's arrest report states that he restrained petitioner after petitioner made a threatening gesture in response to an inquiry, and that petitioner then hit him.  Petitioner categorically denies this account, and says that he neither threatened nor struck the officer.  On the date of petitioner's deportation hearing, the assault charge was still pending, and the record reveals no definitive disposition (although, at oral argument before us, petitioner's counsel represented that the charge is now by the boards).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this juncture, we temporarily shift our focus to the statutory scheme.  Petitioner's conviction on the firearms charge rendered him deportable under section 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Confronted by this statute, petitioner attempted to confess and avoid:  he conceded deportability, but sought an adjustment of status under INA Sec. 245(a), 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1255(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This course was theoretically open because, under the immigration laws, the grounds for deportation are not congruent with those for exclusion of aliens.  Thus, petitioner's firearms conviction rendered him deportable, but not per se excludable.  Compare 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(2)(C) with <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 1182(a) </span>(listing grounds for exclusion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, resident aliens who are subject to exclusion upon leaving and attempting to reenter the country may apply for waivers of inadmissibility under INA Sec. 212(c), 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Section 212(c) waivers are equally available to aliens in deportation proceedings as long as the ground for deportation is also a stated ground for exclusion.  See Campos v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581362\"><a href=\"/opinion/581362/andres-antonio-campos-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>, 313 (1st Cir.1992).  But such waivers are not available to aliens in deportation proceedings when the ground for deportation is not also a stated ground for exclusion.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581362\"><a href=\"/opinion/581362/andres-antonio-campos-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 316.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's case falls between these stools.  Lacking the foundational prerequisite for seeking a section 212(c) waiver, he opted to use an application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) as an alternate vehicle.  See Matter of Rainford, Interim Dec.  No. 3191, at 6 (BIA 1992) (authorizing status-adjustment applications in such circumstances).  The INS acknowledges that he is eligible to be considered for adjustment of status under section 245(a).  Whether he deserves the relief is a different story.  On that score, an immigration judge (IJ) initially considered and denied petitioner's application for adjustment of status.  He explained that a section 245(a) adjustment is a discretionary remedy;  that to receive such a benefice an otherwise deportable alien must show unusual or outstanding equities sufficient to overbalance the negative factor(s) on which the finding of deportability rests;  and that, in petitioner's case, the equities did not adequately preponderate in his favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner appealed.  See 8 C.F.R. Sec. 3.1(b)(2) (1995) (providing for administrative appeals of such orders).  The Board, exercising de novo review, see Gouveia v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596105\"><a href=\"/opinion/596105/jose-gouveia-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span>, 817 (1st Cir.1992), denied relief.  In its view, petitioner's strong points, e.g., his family ties to the United States, his protracted residence here, and his belated efforts at rehabilitation, did not overcome the discredit inherent in his criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not print on a pristine page.  The IJ made extensive findings in this matter, and the Board issued a comprehensive decision adopting many of those findings.  After careful perscrutation of the record, we discern no fatal flaw in the Board's rationale.  Thus, we uphold the denial of petitioner's request for adjustment of status for essentially the reasons stated by the Board, adding relatively few comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to grant or deny an application for adjustment of status is one that rests within the informed discretion of the Attorney General, see 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1255(a), and, by delegation, within the informed discretion of the Board.  As a result, the ambit of judicial review is tightly circumscribed.  Courts are entitled to probe the Board's discretionary decisions only to the extent necessary to ascertain whether the Board misread the law or otherwise misused its discretion.  See Martinez v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587571\"><a href=\"/opinion/587571/javier-a-martinez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span>, 974 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, adjudicatory tribunals can exceed grants of discretion--even ringing grants of broad, essentially standardless discretion--in various ways.  We have pointed out that courts can abuse discretion in any of three aspects, namely, by neglecting to consider a significant factor that appropriately bears on the discretionary decision, by attaching weight to a factor that does not appropriately bear on the decision, or by assaying all the proper factors and no improper ones, but nonetheless making a clear judgmental error in weighing them.  See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593292\"><a href=\"/opinion/593292/united-states-v-leslie-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1992);  Independent Oil &amp; Chem.

Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516410\"><a href=\"/opinion/516410/the-independent-oil-and-chemical-workers-of-quincy-inc-v-the-procter/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 929 (1st Cir.1988).  Like a court, so, too, an administrative adjudicative body charged with making a discretionary decision can stray beyond the pale in any of these three ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner asserts that the Board abused its discretion in all the respects that we have mentioned.  We deal briefly with each facet of this trifurcated assertion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First and foremost, petitioner asseverates that the Board improperly failed to consider all the factors favorable to him.  In particular, citing Matter of Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. 581, 584-85 (BIA 1978), a section 212(c) waiver case, he maintains that the Board unnecessarily limited the data it considered in assessing the equities underpinning his request for adjustment of status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the section 212(c) milieu, the Board and reviewing courts habitually refer to a stock list of factors that potentially inform the equities attendant to a waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Petitioner asks us to transplant this list wholesale and mandate its use in connection with status-adjustment applications under section 245(a). This importuning reaches too far:  fairly viewed, it solicits the overruling, sub silentio, of this court's decision in Campos.   There, we held that the Attorney General could rationally decide not to make section 212(c) waiver relief available to aliens convicted of firearms offenses that rendered them deportable but not automatically excludable.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581362\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Campos,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/581362/andres-antonio-campos-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>.   In so holding, we made it crystal clear that the section 212(c) waiver provision, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c), \"could not be utilized to waive all grounds of deportability, but only those grounds of deportability having a corresponding ground of excludability....\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581362\"><a href=\"/opinion/581362/andres-antonio-campos-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 313 </a></span>(emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner today tries to bring in through the back door the same iteration that the Campos court barred at the front door.  His core argument is that the Board abused its discretion by not applying the section 212(c) waiver criteria to an adjustment of status case.  Were we to accept this construct, we would effectively require INS to afford deportable but not necessarily excludable aliens (like petitioner) relief exactly equivalent to that available under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c).  But we expressly declined to dictate such a result when we concluded in Campos that the law did not make waiver of inadmissibility available to all deportable aliens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no reason to revisit the matter.  When all is said and done, waiver of inadmissibility is an extraordinary discretionary remedy that Congress, in enacting section 212(c), made available primarily to assist excludable aliens who had been long-term residents of this country.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581362\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Campos,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/581362/andres-antonio-campos-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>.   Congress painstakingly set the limits within which the waiver proviso is to operate.  The courts have no roving writ that enables them to refashion the legislature's handiwork and stretch the statute to cover all cases in which a person might suffer deportation as a result of his own crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the argument that petitioner advances is largely academic in the circumstances at hand.  Even in section 212(c) waiver cases, the Marin factors are only illustrative.  They do not comprise an invariable checklist.  See Hazime v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663741\"><a href=\"/opinion/663741/jamal-ahmad-hazime-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 140 (6th Cir.)

So long as the Board gives adequate consideration to the equities supporting a favorable exercise of discretion, it discharges its duty under section 212(c).  See id.;   see also Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. at 585.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the administrative record makes it plain that the Board paid satisfactory heed to the relevant factors.  It explicitly noted petitioner's length of residence, his family ties, his tentative steps toward rehabilitation, and the conceivable hardships (including the likely loss of his proprietary interest in a start-up business).  Petitioner offered no evidence regarding military service or community activities.  Thus, the Board in effect considered all the pertinent Marin factors despite the absence of any obligation to do so.  Petitioner has no valid ground for his Marin-based complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, petitioner posits that the Board pondered a factor that should have been excluded from the decisional calculus:  his 1992 arrest for allegedly assaulting a police officer.  He pegs this claim on Matter of Arreguin, Interim Dec.  No. 3247 (BIA 1995), a case decided four days before the Board decided Henry's appeal, and asserts that Arreguin stands for a black-letter rule proscribing consideration of arrest reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with basics.  The law recognizes that in an agency as large as the INS different officials may not act identically in every case.  This lack of complete uniformity is unavoidable--after all, administrators are not automatons--and does not, in an of itself, invalidate agency action.  Nonetheless, agencies do not have carte blanche.  While a certain amount of asymmetry is lawful, see Davila-Bardales v. INS, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1994);  Puerto Rican Cement Co. v. EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532021\"><a href=\"/opinion/532021/puerto-rican-cement-company-inc-v-united-states-environmental-protection/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 299 (1st Cir.1989), an agency may not \"adopt[ ] significantly inconsistent policies that result in the creation of conflicting lines of precedent governing the identical situation.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Davila-Bardales,</span> <span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">5</span> </span>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear:  the precept counselling avoidance of inconsistent administrative policies does not freeze an agency's jurisprudence for all time.  See, e.g., Congreso de Uniones Industriales de P.R. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584187\"><a href=\"/opinion/584187/congreso-de-uniones-industriales-de-puerto-rico-v-national-labor-relations/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1992);  Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528445\"><a href=\"/opinion/528445/shaws-supermarkets-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1989).  The precept demands, however, that if the \"administrative agency decides to depart significantly from its own precedent, it must confront the issue squarely and explain why the departure is reasonable.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Davila-Bardales,</span> <span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4</span></span>.   In other words, administrative agencies must apply the same basic rules to all similarly situated supplicants.  An agency cannot merely flit serendipitously from case to case, like a bee buzzing from flower to flower, making up the rules as it goes along.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is against this chiseled backdrop that we turn to Arreguin.   There, the Board reversed an IJ's refusal to grant a section 212(c) waiver to an alien convicted of playing a minor role in a marijuana importing scheme.  In denying relief, the IJ considered a twelve-year-old arrest record on charges (later dropped) of smuggling aliens into the United States.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Arreguin,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">8</span></span>.   While the Board sanctioned the admissibility of the arrest record into evidence, it explained that, under the circumstances, it would give the record scant weight.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   Petitioner maintains </span>that Arreguin establishes a black-letter rule gainsaying reliance on arrest records, and, thus, that consistency of precedent requires reversal of the instant order.  We demur:  the Board's decision in Arreguin did not require it ipso facto to disregard altogether the report of petitioner's 1992 arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal problem presented by petitioner's prohibitory proposition is Arreguin itself.  The case simply does not announce the rigid rule that petitioner ascribes to it.  There, the Board approved the IJ's admission of a particularly vulnerable arrest record into evidence, and agreed that it had some probative value.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   The difficulty </span>was that, under the circumstances of the particular case, the IJ gave the record more weight than it deserved, and, concomitantly, neglected to give full effect to many positive elements buttressing the petitioner's case.  Properly read, Arreguin implicates matters of degree, explaining the relative weight that should be given to arrest records.  Nothing in the opinion suggests that, when facing a closer balance of equities, the Board might not properly decide that a record of arrest tips the scales against the bestowal of discretionary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Arreguin represent an alteration of prior precedent.  The traditional rules of evidence do not apply in immigration hearings, see, e.g., Espinoza v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686823\"><a href=\"/opinion/686823/ramiro-cruz-espinoza-v-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 310 (9th Cir.1995), and arrest reports historically have been admissible in such proceedings, see Paredes-Urrestarazu v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678881\"><a href=\"/opinion/678881/byron-paredes-urrestarazu-v-us-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span>, 813 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that the Board may entertain arrest records as evidence).  Moreover, while an arrest, without more, is simply an unproven charge, the fact of the arrest, and its attendant circumstances, often have probative value in immigration proceedings.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678881\"><a href=\"/opinion/678881/byron-paredes-urrestarazu-v-us-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 810 </a></span>(\"The fact of arrest, insofar as it bears upon whether an alien might have engaged in underlying conduct and insofar as facts probative of an alien's 'bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident' arise from the arrest itself, plainly can have relevance\" in discretionary relief).  Arreguin does not purport to command any deviation from these venerable practices or to prohibit the type of recourse that the Board historically has made to arrest records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fine, the lesson of Arreguin is that, when the Board appraises the considerations on both sides of the discretionary balance to determine whether they are in equipoise, it will accord virtually no weight to an arrest record remote in time and unsupported by corroborating evidence.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Arreguin,</span> supra, at <span class=\"page\">8</span></span>.   Here, the Board adumbrated that rather unremarkable lesson.  It considered the 1992 arrest report in a limited way, without giving excessive weight to it.  It was entitled to do so, Arreguin notwithstanding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his most broad-gauged foray, petitioner maintains that the Board drew the wrong conclusions from the factors it considered.  In this context, petitioner complains that he demonstrated strong familial ties to the United States, long-term residency here, and hardship in the event of deportation.  These, he continues, are the very factors the Board has required a petitioner to demonstrate in order to make the showing of outstanding equities necessary to overcome strong negative factors.  See Matter of Arai, 13 I &amp; N Dec. 494, 496 (BIA 1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's argument misapprehends both the nature of status adjustment and the role of judicial review.  Adjustment of status is not an entitlement, but, rather, an extraordinary remedy.  The Board need not make the anodyne available to all who theoretically qualify.  Indeed, the Attorney General has cautioned that the Board's regimen in Arai \"does not establish rigid rules which deny to immigration judges the flexibility necessary to carry out their duty to analyze sensitively the competing factors in each particular case.\"  Matter of Blas, 15 I &amp; N Dec. 626, 641 (Atty.Gen.1976), aff'd, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span> </span>(9th Cir.1977).  Thus, status adjustment is quintessentially a matter \"of administrative discretion.\"  Arai, 13 I &amp; N Dec. at 496.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, when a matter is committed by law to the Board's sound discretion, a reviewing court plays a very restricted role in overseeing the administrative exercise of that discretion.  So long as the Board follows its own settled principles and provides a reasoned explanation for its decision, judicial review is at an end.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596105\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gouveia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/596105/jose-gouveia-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587571\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Martinez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/587571/javier-a-martinez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, discretion is not to be confused with imperiousness.  When the Board rejects a request for adjustment of status, it must articulate its reasons for taking that action, and those reasons must be plausible.  Nonetheless, the existence of favorable information under each of the three Arai headings does not require the Board to grant adjustment of status.  See Blas, 15 I &amp; N Dec. at 641.   As we have written in an analogous setting, \"even the presence of preponderant equities or equities that in the abstract could qualify as 'unusual' or 'outstanding' does not compel the Board to grant relief.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596105\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gouveia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/596105/jose-gouveia-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Board offered an adequate explanation of why it believed that petitioner's favorable factors were not sufficiently compelling to justify adjustment of status.  The Board's decision focused on the seriousness of the firearms conviction.  It observed that both petitioner and his companion were armed at the time of the arrest, and that petitioner had maintained a deception by utilizing a pseudonym throughout the criminal proceedings.  The Board also looked to petitioner's history of altercations with the law, particularly his tardiness in acknowledging his crimes in New York.  It took due note of the favorable factors advanced by petitioner but determined, on balance, that these points were not sufficiently robust to yield the kind of unusual and outstanding equitable case that would warrant an adjustment of status.  In short, the Board persuasively explained the premises on which it declined to exercise its discretion.  That ends the matter.  A reviewing court may not reweigh the equities afresh.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596105\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gouveia,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/596105/jose-gouveia-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>.V</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Adjustment of status is a discretionary remedy.  Although the Board could have afforded petitioner this remedy, it chose not to do so.  That is both the Board's prerogative and its duty.  In the absence of either a mistake of law or a palpable abuse of discretion, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is denied and dismissed.

For one thing, Arreguin is a section 212(c) waiver case, and there is no requirement that the Board treat section 245(a) status adjustment cases like waiver cases.  For another thing, Henry himself offered the arrest record as evidence before the IJ, apparently as part of an attempt to explain away the incident in question.  It ill behooves him to complain on appeal that the Board should not have paid heed to evidence that he proffered.  See Johnson v.
