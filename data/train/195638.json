This is a  diversity action brought in\n                    \n\nthe United States  District Court for the District  of Puerto\n\nRico for personal injury.  Plaintiff, Hector  Roman-Gonzalez,\n\nas a lark, climbed a guy wire attached to a pole belonging to\n\ndefendant, Puerto Rico Electric  Power Authority.  He climbed\n\nso high that his  head came in contact with the  high voltage\n\npower line the pole was carrying, and he was severely burned.\n\nOn the basis of the pleadings, affidavits, and depositions of\n\nexperts,  the court entered  summary judgment  for defendant,\n\nand  plaintiff appeals.   We  affirm, basically  adopting the\n\ncourt's comprehensive opinion.\n\n          After reciting  the evidence, the court stated that\n\ndefendant  had established  that \"no  proximate cause  exists\n\nbetween  any  act  or   omission  by  PREPA  and  plaintiff's\n\ninjuries,\" even if defendant  had been negligent with respect\n\nto  the guy  wire.   At first  blush this raises  a question,\n\nsince  contributory  negligence  by  a  plaintiff  does   not\n\nnecessarily break  the chain of causation.

However,\n                          \n\nthe  court's  concept  was   that  defendant  may  have  been\n\nnegligent with  respect to a  lineman properly at  the locus,\n\nbut  not as  to plaintiff, who  voluntarily trespassed.   The\n\ncourt's reasoning was defendant \"could not have foreseen that\n\na twenty year-old would climb 23 to  24 feet on a guy wire to\n\namuse himself.\"   \"[T]he  controlling  factor in  determining\n\n                             -2-\n\nwhether  [defendant's] actions  or  inactions  are  negligent\n\n[with  respect  to  plaintiff]  is the  probability  of  risk\n\ninvolved.\"  \"The Authority could not reasonably have foreseen\n\nthe situation . . . [which] was too fortuitous to require the\n\nelectric company to guard against it.\"\n\n          We agree.   While anything is  possible, there must\n\nbe  a limit  in  a  practical  world  to  what  conduct  must\n\nreasonably be foreseen.  Small children could not be expected\n\nto climb a wire to that height; a man of twenty ought to know\n\nthe difference  between a  slack, supporting guy  wire openly\n\ntouchable  at ground level,  and an electric  power line, and\n\nthat  electricity is dangerous.   Hence there was  no duty to\n\neither one to provide a more complex structure.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -3-\n",
