Plaintiff-appellant  Richard\r                                       \n\nLeavitt  filed a pro se  complaint in the  District Court for\r                                   \n\nthe  District  of  Maine  against  the  Maine  Department  of\n\nCorrections,  the  Maine  State  Prison,  and  twelve  prison\n\nofficials and guards.  The complaint alleged that on November\n\n15, 1993,  Leavitt, while watching a  prison basketball game,\n\nmade an  unspecified remark to another  inmate concerning one\n\nof the basketball players (in a later  filing, Leavitt stated\n\nthat  the remark was, \"Two  babies for that  foul, they're in\n\nthe bonus\").  Defendant  Woodbury, a prison guard, confronted\n\nLeavitt about the remark, became angry and physically removed\n\nLeavitt from  the area,  grabbing, pushing, and  shoving him.\n\nWoodbury filed  a disciplinary  report charging  Leavitt with\n\nprovocation and  disorderly behavior and took  Leavitt to the\n\nadministrative  segregation area,  where he  was subsequently\n\nhoused for 24 days.\n\n          Leavitt then  filed  a grievance  against  Woodbury\n\nunder  the prison grievance procedure, alleging that Woodbury\n\npushed,  grabbed,  and shoved  him.   Woodbury  then  filed a\n\nsecond disciplinary report against Leavitt, charging him with\n\nlying in the grievance filing.\n\n          Following a hearing on the two disciplinary charges\n\nagainst Leavitt, Leavitt was found guilty on all charges.  He\n\nwas punished with, apparently, a total of 40 days of punitive\n\nsegregation  and 40 days' loss of good time credits, with all\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nof it  suspended except for a  loss of ten days  of good time\n\ncredits.  All of Leavitt's appeals were denied.\n\n          According to the complaint, prison officials failed\n\nto   adequately   investigate  Leavitt's   grievance  against\n\nWoodbury.  The grievance was apparently dismissed.\n\n          Later, on  January 10,  1994, defendant  Gallant, a\n\nprison guard, allegedly insulted  Leavitt and told Leavitt to\n\nleave the  gymnasium area, without any  provocation.  Leavitt\n\nfiled a grievance against Gallant.  According to Leavitt, the\n\ngrievance was  not fully investigated.   Ultimately, however,\n\nGallant was given a verbal reprimand.\n\n          In  his  complaint,  Leavitt  sought  damages  from\n\ndefendants,  and an  injunction  ordering them  to cease  and\n\ndesist  from violating  his constitutional  rights, under  42\n\nU.S.C.   1983.   Specifically, he alleged that he  was denied\n\ndue process  and equal protection in  the prison disciplinary\n\nprocedure; that his Eighth  Amendment rights were violated by\n\nthe loss of good time credits as a result of that  procedure;\n\nthat  his  First  Amendment  rights were  violated  by  being\n\ndisciplined  for his  unspecified  remark  at the  basketball\n\ngame; that  his due process  and Sixth Amendment  rights were\n\nviolated  by the  prison's failure  to adequately  follow its\n\ngrievance  procedure regarding his  grievances; that  his due\n\nprocess   rights   were   violated   by   being   brought  to\n\nadministrative  segregation  without  explanation, and  being\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nkept  there  for   24  days  without   a  hearing  or   other\n\nadministrative procedure; that his constitutional rights were\n\nviolated  by   defamatory  statements  made   about  him   by\n\ndefendants  Woodbury  and   Gallant;  and  that   his  Eighth\n\nAmendment  rights  were violated  when  he  was assaulted  by\n\ndefendants Woodbury  and Gallant  and kept  in administrative\n\nsegregation  despite  a  risk  of physical  harm  from  other\n\ninmates.\n\n          A  magistrate  judge  recommended   that  Leavitt's\n\ncomplaint  be  dismissed  as  frivolous  under  28  U.S.C.   \n\n1915(d).   The district court adopted  the magistrate judge's\n\nreport and dismissed the complaint.  \n\n          We  agree  that  most of  Leavitt's  complaint  was\n\nproperly dismissed  under   1915(d) because  the legal theory\n\nunderlying Leavitt's claims  was indisputably meritless.   To\n\nbegin with, assuming  Leavitt had a  liberty interest in  his\n\ndisciplinary  hearing,  his  own  allegations  show  that due\n\nprocess was accorded him.  \n\n          Leavitt  was  entitled  to  \"an  opportunity,  when\n\nconsistent with institutional safety and  correctional goals,\n\nto  call witnesses  and present  documentary evidence  in his\n\ndefense.\"  Superintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454  (1985).\r                                             \n\nHe  was   entitled  to   be  given  an   explanation,  either\n\ncontemporaneously  or subsequently,  for  any denial  of this\n\nopportunity.  Ponte v. Real, 471 U.S. 491, 497 (1985).  \r                                       \n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          Leavitt  acknowledges  that   his  witnesses   were\n\npermitted  to  make  statements  to  the  disciplinary  board\n\nregarding the first disciplinary report (charging provocation\n\nand disorderly behavior).   When the disciplinary board moved\n\non to  the second disciplinary report  (charging that Leavitt\n\nlied  in  filing  his grievance  against  Woodbury),  Leavitt\n\nalleges that his  request to present  three of his  witnesses\n\nwas  denied \"without  explanation, other  than they  were not\n\neyewitnesses to  the actual act of writing the grievance, but\n\ndid witness the actions  in the gymnasium.\"  In  other words,\n\nLeavitt does  acknowledge that  the board, having  just heard\n\nhis witnesses  in connection  with the  first report,  gave a\n\nreason for declining to  hear them again.  Since  this reason\n\nwas  clearly  not  arbitrary,  we  find  it  constitutionally\n\nadequate.  See id.  \r                             \n\n          By  the  same  token,   there  is  nothing  in  the\n\ncomplaint to  suggest that  Leavitt could, by  amendment, add\n\nadequate   allegations   that  this   disciplinary  procedure\n\nviolated his Eighth  Amendment rights or  his right to  equal\n\nprotection of the laws.\n\n          As for Leavitt's  charges of defamation, defamation\n\nalone does not state a cause of action under   1983.  Paul v.\r                                                                      \n\nDavis,  424 U.S. 693, 701-10  (1976).  As  long as procedural\r                 \n\ndue process is afforded the inmate in the prison disciplinary\n\nhearing,  and  no   substantive  constitutional  rights   are\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nimplicated,  a prison inmate cannot bring a   1983 action for\n\ndefamation  against  prison  officials  on  the  ground  that\n\ncharges resolved  against the inmate  in prison  disciplinary\n\nproceedings were false and defamatory.  See Franco v.  Kelly,\r                                                                        \n\n854 F.2d 584, 587-88 (2nd Cir. 1988).\n\n          The due process clause does not, in and  of itself,\n\nconfer upon an inmate a right to pursue grievance proceedings\n\nagainst prison officials.   Mann v. Adams, 855 F.2d  639, 640\r                                                     \n\n(9th  Cir.  1988).    Furthermore,  prison regulations  which\n\nestablish a grievance procedure cannot give rise to a liberty\n\ninterest because they confer only procedural protections, not\n\nsubstantive  rights,  upon  the   inmates  who  may  use  the\n\ngrievance procedures.  Azeez v. DeRobertis, 568 F.Supp. 8, 10\r                                                      \n\n(N.D.Ill.  1982); see  generally Shango  v. Jurich,  681 F.2d\r                                                              \n\n1091  (7th  Cir. 1982).   Accordingly,  Leavitt's allegations\n\nthat  certain defendants failed  to properly  investigate his\n\ngrievances cannot support a constitutional claim.\n\n          Leavitt's  allegations  of excessive  force against\n\ndefendant Woodbury  are limited  to the charge  that Woodbury\n\nshoved, pushed, and grabbed  him.  Against defendant Gallant,\n\nLeavitt's  allegations are  limited to  verbal abuse.   These\n\nallegations  are therefore  de minimis  and cannot  provide a\n\nbasis for a   1983 claim.  \"Not every  push or shove, even if\n\nit  may  later seem  unnecessary in  the  peace of  a judge's\n\nchambers,  violates  a  prisoner's   constitutional  rights.\"\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nHudson v. McMillian, 503  U.S. 1, 15 (1992)  (quoting Johnson\r                                                                         \n\nv.  Glick, 481 F.2d 1028,  1033 (2d Cir.),  cert. denied, 414\r                                                                    \n\nU.S. 1033 (1973)).\n\n          Leavitt's  allegation that  his due  process rights\n\nwere violated  by being brought to administrative segregation\n\nwithout explanation is fatally defective.  Even if  a liberty\n\ninterest   was   implicated   by   Leavitt's   placement   in\n\nsegregation,  all  that  due  process  requires  is  that  an\n\ninformal administrative procedure  \"occur within a reasonable\n\ntime following an inmate's  transfer.\"  Hewitt v.  Helms, 459\r                                                                    \n\nU.S. 460,  476 n.8 (1982).   Leavitt was not entitled  to any\n\nprocedure before, or contemporaneous with, his transfer.\n\n          Finally,  Leavitt's  allegation   that  his   First\n\nAmendment  rights   were  violated  by  discipline   for  his\n\nstatement  at  the basketball  game  was  properly dismissed.\n\nThis   statement,  again,   has  been   found  by   a  prison\n\ndisciplinary  board to constitute  provocative and disorderly\n\nconduct.   An  inmate has  no First  Amendment right  to make\n\nstatements  reasonably  judged   by  prison  authorities   to\n\nconstitute  attempts to provoke other inmates.  See Ustrak v.\r                                                                      \n\nFairman, 781 F.2d 573, 580 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n824 (1986).\n\n          Leavitt  did make  two allegations,  however, which\n\nwere not  premised on indisputably  meritless legal theories.\n\nAlthough  Leavitt's  allegations may  have  lacked sufficient\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\ndetail to  state constitutional claims which  could survive a\n\nRule  12(b)(6)  motion to  dismiss,  any  such problem  could\n\nconceivably be  cured by more  specific factual  allegations.\n\nSee Street v. Fair, 918 F.2d 269, 272-73 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                              \n\n          The first of these is  Leavitt's claim that his due\n\nprocess rights were violated  by being held in administrative\n\nsegregation for 24 days  without \"a hearing or administrative\n\nprocedure regarding  the movement to the  segregation unit in\n\nviolation  of the  procedures, rules  and regulations  of the\n\nMaine State Prison.\"   Although the  due process clause  does\n\nnot,  in  and of  itself, confer  upon  a prisoner  a liberty\n\ninterest  in being  held  in the  general prison  population,\n\nHewitt v. Helms, 459  U.S. 460, 467-68 (1983), state  laws or\r                           \n\nregulations may  create a  protected liberty interest  if, by\n\nsetting forth \"explicitly  mandatory language\" and \"specified\n\nsubstantive  predicates,\"  Kentucky Dep't  of  Corrections v.\r                                                                      \n\nThompson, 490 U.S. 454, 463 (1989), they \"plac[e] substantive\r                    \n\nlimitations  on official discretion,\" Olim v. Wakinekona, 461\r                                                                    \n\nU.S. 238, 249 (1983).   Leavitt's complaint does  not specify\n\nwhat prison regulations should be thought to confer a liberty\n\ninterest,  but  certainly  he  might   do  so  if  given  the\n\nopportunity to amend his complaint.  If he did have a liberty\n\ninterest in his placement in administrative segregation, then\n\nhis  allegation that  he  was maintained  there  for 24  days\n\nwithout any procedure  would appear adequate to state a claim\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nof  a due process violation.   See Hewitt, supra, 459 U.S. at\r                                                            \n\n472, 476-77.\n\n          Finally,  the Eighth  Amendment  is violated  where\n\nprison officials act with deliberate indifference to a strong\n\nand palpable risk  of physical harm to an inmate at the hands\n\nof other prisoners.  Purvis v. Ponte,  929 F.2d 822, 825 (1st\r                                                \n\nCir.  1991).  All  that Leavitt has  alleged, to be  sure, is\n\nthat  his   \"safety  was  threatened\"  during   his  time  in\n\nsegregation, and that it was \"an environment where his safety\n\nwas  in  danger  at  all  times.\"     Again,  however,  these\n\nconclusory allegations  are  not  based  on  an  indisputably\n\ndeficient legal theory not conceivably curable by amendment.\n\n          Accordingly, we  remand this  case to  the district\n\ncourt  for further proceedings.  As a result of this opinion,\n\nLeavitt   is  now   on   notice  that   in  order   to  state\n\nconstitutional claims  he  cannot rest  on vague,  conclusory\n\nallegations, but  rather must set  forth factual  allegations\n\nsupporting the  material elements of  his claims.   Gooley v.\r                                                                      \n\nMobil Oil Corp., 851  F.2d 513, 514-15 (1st  Cir. 1988).   On\r                          \n\nremand, therefore, Leavitt should amend his complaint.\n\n          The judgment of the  district court is vacated, and\r                                                                    \n\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\r                                \n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n",

Defendant Woodbury, a prison guard, confronted Leavitt about the remark, became angry and physically removed Leavitt from the area, grabbing, pushing, and shoving him.

Ultimately, however, Gallant was given a verbal reprimand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint, Leavitt sought damages from defendants, and an injunction ordering them to cease and desist from violating his constitutional rights, under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.  Specifically, he alleged that he was denied due process and equal protection in the prison disciplinary procedure;  that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated by the loss of good time credits as a result of that procedure;  that his First Amendment rights were violated by being disciplined for his unspecified remark at the basketball game;  that his due process and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the prison's failure to adequately follow its grievance procedure regarding his grievances;  that his due process rights were violated by being brought to administrative segregation without explanation, and being kept there for 24 days without a hearing or other administrative procedure;  that his constitutional rights were violated by defamatory statements made about him by defendants Woodbury and Gallant;  and that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated when he was assaulted by defendants Woodbury and Gallant and kept in administrative segregation despite a risk of physical harm from other inmates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A magistrate judge recommended that Leavitt's complaint be dismissed as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915(d).

To begin with, assuming Leavitt had a liberty interest in his disciplinary hearing, his own allegations show that due process was accorded him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leavitt was entitled to \"an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense.\"  Superintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985).  He was entitled to be given an explanation, either contemporaneously or subsequently, for any denial of this opportunity.  Ponte v. Real, 471 U.S. 491, 497 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leavitt acknowledges that his witnesses were permitted to make statements to the disciplinary board regarding the first disciplinary report (charging provocation and disorderly behavior).  When the disciplinary board moved on to the second disciplinary report (charging that Leavitt lied in filing his grievance against Woodbury), Leavitt alleges that his request to present three of his witnesses was denied \"without explanation, other than they were not eyewitnesses to the actual act of writing the grievance, but did witness the actions in the gymnasium.\"  In other words, Leavitt does acknowledge that the board, having just heard his witnesses in connection with the first report, gave a reason for declining to hear them again.  Since this reason was clearly not arbitrary, we find it constitutionally adequate.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, there is nothing in the complaint to suggest that Leavitt could, by amendment, add adequate allegations that this disciplinary procedure violated his Eighth Amendment rights or his right to equal protection of the laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Leavitt's charges of defamation, defamation alone does not state a cause of action under Sec. 1983.  Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701-10 (1976).  As long as procedural due process is afforded the inmate in the prison disciplinary hearing, and no substantive constitutional rights are implicated, a prison inmate cannot bring a Sec. 1983 action for defamation against prison officials on the ground that charges resolved against the inmate in prison disciplinary proceedings were false and defamatory.  See Franco v. Kelly, 854 F.2d 584, 587-88 (2nd Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The due process clause does not, in and of itself, confer upon an inmate a right to pursue grievance proceedings against prison officials.  Mann v. Adams, 855 F.2d 639, 640 (9th Cir. 1988).  Furthermore, prison regulations which establish a grievance procedure cannot give rise to a liberty interest because they confer only procedural protections, not substantive rights, upon the inmates who may use the grievance procedures.  Azeez v. DeRobertis, 568 F.Supp. 8, 10 (N.D.Ill. 1982);  see generally Shango v. Jurich, 681 F.2d 1091 (7th Cir. 1982).  Accordingly, Leavitt's allegations that certain defendants failed to properly investigate his grievances cannot support a constitutional claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leavitt's allegations of excessive force against defendant Woodbury are limited to the charge that Woodbury shoved, pushed, and grabbed him.  Against defendant Gallant, Leavitt's allegations are limited to verbal abuse.  These allegations are therefore de minimis and cannot provide a basis for a Sec. 1983 claim.  \"Not every push or shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge's chambers, violates a prisoner's constitutional rights.\"  Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 15 (1992) (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1033 (1973)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leavitt's allegation that his due process rights were violated by being brought to administrative segregation without explanation is fatally defective.  Even if a liberty interest was implicated by Leavitt's placement in segregation, all that due process requires is that an informal administrative procedure \"occur within a reasonable time following an inmate's transfer.\"  Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 476 n.8 (1982).  Leavitt was not entitled to any procedure before, or contemporaneous with, his transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Leavitt's allegation that his First Amendment rights were violated by discipline for his statement at the basketball game was properly dismissed.  This statement, again, has been found by a prison disciplinary board to constitute provocative and disorderly conduct.  An inmate has no First Amendment right to make statements reasonably judged by prison authorities to constitute attempts to provoke other inmates.  See Ustrak v. Fairman, 781 F.2d 573, 580 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 824 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leavitt did make two allegations, however, which were not premised on indisputably meritless legal theories.  Although Leavitt's allegations may have lacked sufficient detail to state constitutional claims which could survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, any such problem could conceivably be cured by more specific factual allegations.  See Street v. Fair, 918 F.2d 269, 272-73 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these is Leavitt's claim that his due process rights were violated by being held in administrative segregation for 24 days without \"a hearing or administrative procedure regarding the movement to the segregation unit in violation of the procedures, rules and regulations of the Maine State Prison.\"  Although the due process clause does not, in and of itself, confer upon a prisoner a liberty interest in being held in the general prison population, Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 467-68 (1983), state laws or regulations may create a protected liberty interest if, by setting forth \"explicitly mandatory language\" and \"specified substantive predicates,\" Kentucky Dep't of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 463 (1989), they \"plac[e] substantive limitations on official discretion,\" Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 249 (1983).  Leavitt's complaint does not specify what prison regulations should be thought to confer a liberty interest, but certainly he might do so if given the opportunity to amend his complaint.  If he did have a liberty interest in his placement in administrative segregation, then his allegation that he was maintained there for 24 days without any procedure would appear adequate to state a claim of a due process violation.  See Hewitt, supra, 459 U.S. at 472, 476-77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Eighth Amendment is violated where prison officials act with deliberate indifference to a strong and palpable risk of physical harm to an inmate at the hands of other prisoners.  Purvis v. Ponte, 929 F.2d 822, 825 (1st Cir. 1991).  All that Leavitt has alleged, to be sure, is that his \"safety was threatened\" during his time in segregation, and that it was \"an environment where his safety was in danger at all times.\"  Again, however, these conclusory allegations are not based on an indisputably deficient legal theory not conceivably curable by amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.  As a result of this opinion, Leavitt is now on notice that in order to state constitutional claims he cannot rest on vague, conclusory allegations, but rather must set forth factual allegations supporting the material elements of his claims.  Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 514-15 (1st Cir. 1988).  On remand, therefore, Leavitt should amend his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The complaint alleged that on November 15, 1993, Leavitt, while watching a prison basketball game, made an unspecified remark to another inmate concerning one of the basketball players (in a later filing, Leavitt stated that the remark was, \"Two babies for that foul, they're in the bonus\").  Defendant Woodbury, a prison guard, confronted Leavitt about the remark, became angry and physically removed Leavitt from the area, grabbing, pushing, and shoving him.  Woodbury filed a disciplinary report charging Leavitt with provocation and disorderly behavior and took Leavitt to the administrative segregation area, where he was subsequently housed for 24 days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leavitt then filed a grievance against Woodbury under the prison grievance procedure, alleging that Woodbury pushed, grabbed, and shoved him.

He was punished with, apparently, a total of 40 days of punitive segregation and 40 days' loss of good time credits, with all of it suspended except for a loss of ten days of good time credits.

See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hewitt,</span> supra</a></span>, 459 U.S. at 472, 476-77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Eighth Amendment is violated where prison officials act with deliberate indifference to a strong and palpable risk of physical harm to an inmate at the hands of other prisoners.  Purvis v. Ponte, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558571\"><a href=\"/opinion/558571/kevin-c-purvis-v-joseph-ponte/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 825 (1st Cir. 1991).  All that Leavitt has alleged, to be sure, is that his \"safety was threatened\" during his time in segregation, and that it was \"an environment where his safety was in danger at all times.\"  Again, however, these conclusory allegations are not based on an indisputably deficient legal theory not conceivably curable by amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.  As a result of this opinion, Leavitt is now on notice that in order to state constitutional claims he cannot rest on vague, conclusory allegations, but rather must set forth factual allegations supporting the material elements of his claims.  Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508719\"><a href=\"/opinion/508719/william-r-gooley-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 514-15 (1st Cir. 1988).  On remand, therefore, Leavitt should amend his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
