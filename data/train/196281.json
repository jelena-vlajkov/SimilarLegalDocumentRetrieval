These  consolidated\r                      BOWNES, Senior Circuit  Judge.\r                                                   \r\n\nappeals involve  third-party  claims to  real  properties  in\r\n\nBangor and Portland, Maine (\"the Maine properties\"), that the\r\n\nUnited  States is  trying to  forfeit as  part of  a criminal\r\n\nprosecution  in Massachusetts.   The  District Court  for the\r\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts  granted the third-party claimants'\r\n\nmotion to  dismiss the Maine properties  from the indictment.\r\n\nBecause we  find that  the third-party claims  were premature\r\n\nunder  the applicable criminal  forfeiture statute, we vacate\r\n\nthe order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                            \r\n\n          The  government alleges  that Richard  DeCato, Jr.,\r\n\nthe   principal  of   a  drug-dealing   and  money-laundering\r\n\noperation in New England, purchased the Maine properties with\r\n\nthe proceeds  of drug trafficking and  installed his brother-\r\n\nin-law,  Patrick Cunan,  as the  straw owner.   In  1990, the\r\n\ngovernment  filed two  civil  forfeiture actions  against the\r\n\nMaine properties in the District of Maine.  Not surprisingly,\r\n\nCunan was the only party to assert a claim in those actions.\r\n\n          The  civil forfeiture  actions were  sidetracked by\r\n\npretrial proceedings, including an  appeal to this court, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States  v. TWP 17 R  4, 970 F.2d 984  (1st Cir. 1992),\r                                         \r\n\nand by  the  government's pending  criminal investigation  in\r\n\nMassachusetts.   In 1993, while  both cases  were pending,  a\r\n\nfederal grand  jury in  Massachusetts charged DeCato  and the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nCunans   (Patrick  and   Patricia)  with   various  offenses,\r\n\nincluding conspiracy  to violate federal drug  laws and money\r\n\nlaundering.  Count 37 of the indictment -- which named DeCato\r\n\nalone --  sought criminal forfeiture of  the Maine properties\r\n\nunder 21 U.S.C.   853.\r\n\n          Four days  after the  indictment was  returned, the\r\n\ngovernment moved to dismiss  the two civil forfeiture actions\r\n\nwith prejudice, in deference to the criminal forfeiture count\r                          \r\n\nin  Massachusetts.   Judge Carter  so dismissed  the actions.\r\n\nThe United States Marshal for the District of Maine continued\r\n\nto hold the  assets at issue (including escrowed  monies from\r\n\nthe  sale of  some of  the Portland  properties) pursuant  to\r\n\ninstructions from the United States Attorney for the District\r\n\nof Massachusetts.\r\n\n          Several  months  after the  dismissal of  the civil\r\n\nactions,  Cunan moved in the  District of Maine  for an order\r\n\ndirecting  the Maine  Marshal to  disencumber or  release the\r\n\nPortland assets.  He argued that the dismissal with prejudice\r\n\nof the civil actions barred, as a matter of res judicata, the\r                                                                    \r\n\ncriminal  forfeiture  of  those  assets in  the  District  of\r\n\nMassachusetts.   Judge  Carter denied  the motion,  and Cunan\r\n\nappealed the denial in Appeal No. 93-2278.\r\n\n          In  the District  of Massachusetts,  the government\r\n\nmoved  to restrain  all  of the  properties  in the  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture count.  The Cunans moved, on res judicata grounds,\r                                                                \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nto  strike   or  dismiss   the  Maine  properties   from  the\r\n\nindictment.   Judge  Young entered  a  temporary  restraining\r\n\norder,  took   the  Cunans'  motion   under  advisement,  and\r\n\nultimately held  that claim  preclusion  barred the  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture of the Maine properties.\r\n\n          The government moved  for reconsideration,  arguing\r\n\nfor the first time that the Cunans, who are third parties  to\r\n\nCount 37, must wait until an order of forfeiture has actually\r\n\nbeen  entered before  they may  assert their  claim.   See 21\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.   853(k) (barring third-party intervention in criminal\r\n\nforfeiture action  except as  provided in    853(n)).   Judge\r\n\nYoung denied  reconsideration but noted that \"the restraining\r\n\norder already entered remains in full force and effect.\"  The\r\n\ngovernment appealed the dismissal  of the Maine properties in\r\n\nAppeal No. 94-1599.\r\n\n          In  July,  1994,  DeCato  entered  a  written  plea\r\n\nagreement that forfeited \"his legal and beneficial  interests\r\n\nin  all assets  described  in  Count  37,  including  a  cash\r\n\nforfeiture  in the  amount of  $3,000,000.\"   He acknowledged\r\n\nthat all  such  assets were  subject  to forfeiture  as  \"the\r\n\nproceeds of unlawful drug activity . . . and/or as substitute\r\n\nassets.\"  DeCato also agreed to testify against the Cunans at\r\n\ntheir upcoming trial.\r\n\n          The government then filed a supplemental motion  to\r\n\nrestrain   the  Maine   properties,  although   the  previous\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nrestraining  order does not appear  to have been  lifted.  It\r\n\nargued  that notwithstanding any  preclusive effect  from the\r\n\ndismissal of  the civil actions,  the government was  free to\r\n\nforfeit  DeCato's  interest   in  the  Maine   properties  as\r\n\n\"substitute  assets\"   in  place  of  the   $3  million  cash\r\n\nforfeiture.  See 21 U.S.C.   853(p).  Judge Young entered the\r                            \r\n\nrestraining order as requested,  which the Cunans appealed in\r\n\nAppeal No. 94-2036.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                            \r\n\n          We  begin with  the  government's appeal  from  the\r\n\ndismissal of  the  Maine  properties.    In  its  motion  for\r\n\nreconsideration, the  government argued  that the Cunans  are\r\n\nbarred by 21 U.S.C.   853(k) from asserting their third-party\r\n\nclaim  to  the Maine  properties  until  the properties  have\r\n\nactually been  ordered forfeited to  the United  States.   We\r\n\nconsider  this   argument   on  the   merits,   despite   the\r\n\ngovernment's possible waiver below,  for two reasons.  First,\r\n\nthe district  court did  not expressly  rely  upon waiver  in\r\n\ndenying the  motion for reconsideration.   Second, the Cunans\r\n\nhave not asserted waiver on appeal.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We recognize  that the government's  belated argument  is\r\npossibly a  jurisdictional one,  to the extent  that Congress\r\nmay  have barred  the Cunans from  raising, and  the district\r\ncourt from considering, their claim of ownership of the Maine\r\nproperties.   See Halleran v.  Hoffman, 966 F.2d  45, 47 (1st\r                                                  \r\nCir.  1992)   (\"A   challenge  to   federal  subject   matter\r\njurisdiction may  be raised at  any time,  including for  the\r\nfirst time on appeal.\").   We express no opinion  on this and\r\ndo not rely on it.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          The bar on third-party  intervention in 21 U.S.C.  \r\n\n853(k) provides:\r\n\n          (k)  Except as provided in subsection (n)\r\n          of this  section,  no party  claiming  an\r\n          interest    in   property    subject   to\r\n          forfeiture under this section may --\r\n\n            (1) intervene in a trial or appeal of a\r\n          criminal case involving the forfeiture of\r\n          such property under this subchapter; or\r\n\n            (2) commence an action at law or equity\r\n          against the United States  concerning the\r\n          validity of his  alleged interest in  the\r\n          property subsequent  to the filing  of an\r\n          indictment  or information  alleging that\r\n          the  property  is  subject to  forfeiture\r\n          under this section.\r\n\nSection  853(n), the subsection cited in   853(k), is a wait-\r\n\nand-see  provision:  \"[f]ollowing  the entry  of an  order of\r                                             \r\n\nforfeiture,\" the United States  is required to publish notice\r\n\nof  the  order  to interested  third  parties.      853(n)(1)\r\n\n(emphasis  added).   \"Any  person .  .  . asserting  a  legal\r\n\ninterest in property which has  been ordered forfeited to the\r\n\nUnited  States\" may then \"petition the court for a hearing to\r\n\nadjudicate  the  validity  of  his alleged  interest  in  the\r\n\nproperty.\"    853(n)(2).\r\n\n          The  government argues  that    853(k)  bars  third\r\n\nparties  such  as  the  Cunans  from  participating  in  pre-\r\n\nforfeiture proceedings under any circumstances.  We disagree.\r\n\nA  statutory  exception  to the  bar  is  found  in    853(e)\r\n\n(\"Protective  orders\"):   where the  government seeks  a pre-\r\n\nindictment protective order  against the property alleged  to\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nbe  subject  to forfeiture,  \"persons  appearing  to have  an\r\n\ninterest  in the  property\" must  be  afforded notice  and an\r\n\nopportunity  for a  hearing.     853(e)(1)(B).   There  is no\r\n\nsuggestion that third parties are excluded from this process,\r\n\neven though restraining orders necessarily precede forfeiture\r\n\norders.    In fact,  the legislative  history  of the  bar on\r\n\nthird-party intervention cautions  that \"[t]his provision  is\r\n\nnot  intended to preclude a  third party with  an interest in\r\n\nproperty that is  or may  be subject to  a restraining  order\r\n\nfrom  participating in a hearing regarding the order . . . .\"\r\n\nS.  Rep.  No.  225, 98th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  206 n.42  (1983)\r\n\n(explaining parallel provision of RICO statute), reprinted in\r                                                                         \r\n\n1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3389  n.42.  The legislative history,\r\n\nmoreover, makes  no  distinction between  pre-indictment  and\r\n\npost-indictment restraining orders; evidently,  third parties\r\n\nmay  \"participat[e]\"  in  both  types  of  restraining  order\r\n\nproceedings.   Cf.  id. at  3386 (noting  that although  \"the\r                                   \r\n\npost-indictment restraining order provision  [  853(e)(1)(A)]\r\n\ndoes not require prior notice and opportunity for a hearing,\"\r\n\nthe provision \"does not exclude . . . the authority to hold a\r\n\nhearing  subsequent to the initial  entry of the  order . . .\r\n\n.\").\r\n\n          This  exception  to  the  bar  on intervention  may\r\n\nreflect  due process  concerns.   Section  853(e) presents  a\r\n\nspecial  problem for  third parties,  who face  not  only the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\npotential  forfeiture  of property  in  which  they claim  an\r\n\ninterest,  but also immediate  restraints upon  property that\r\n\nmay be in  their control.   A restraining  order directed  at\r\n\nthird parties  is \"strong medicine,\" United  States v. Regan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n858  F.2d  115, 121  (2d Cir.  1988),  whether it  is entered\r\n\nbefore or after the indictment.\r\n\n          We  conclude that  under     853(e), third  parties\r\n\nclaiming   an   interest   in   restrained   or   potentially\r\n\nrestrainable property  may \"participat[e]\" in  the associated\r\n\nrestraining order proceedings.  We now ask whether the Cunans\r\n\nparticipated  in those proceedings in the manner contemplated\r\n\nby Congress.   After examining the  structure and legislative\r\n\nhistory  of   853(e), we  hold that the  Cunans' res judicata\r                                                                         \r\n\nargument was prematurely made.\r\n\n          Broadly   speaking,   the   government   can   seek\r\n\nprotective orders in  two contexts:  before an indictment has\r\n\nbeen filed, or after.  To obtain  a pre-indictment protective\r\n\norder,  the government  must show,  among other  things, that\r\n\n\"there is  a substantial  probability that the  United States\r\n\nwill  prevail  on  the  issue  of forfeiture  .  .  .  .\"    \r\n\n853(e)(1)(B).    By  contrast,   under     853(e)(1)(A),  the\r\n\nindictment itself establishes the merits  of the government's\r\n\ncase,  and courts  may  enter a  protective  order \"upon  the\r\n\nfiling of an indictment . . . alleging that the property with\r\n\nrespect to which  the order is sought would, in  the event of\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nconviction, be subject to forfeiture . . . .\"   The text of  \r\n\n853(e)(1)(A)  nowhere suggests that  participants in  a post-\r\n\nindictment  protective  order  proceeding can  challenge  the\r\n\nunderlying forfeitability  of the property.   That would turn\r\n\nan  ancillary proceeding into the  main event --  a result at\r\n\nodds  with  Congress'  desire   to  \"assure  a  more  orderly\r\n\ndisposition  of  both  the  criminal  case  and  third  party\r\n\nclaims.\"  1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3390.\r\n\n          The legislative history  of   853(e)(1)(A) confirms\r\n\nthis reading, for it expressly limits  the scope of arguments\r\n\nthat can  be raised  by participants in  a post-indictment   \r\n\n853(e)  proceeding.     \"For   the  purposes  of   issuing  a\r\n\nrestraining  order, the  probable  cause  established in  the\r\n\nindictment  . .  .  is  to  be  determinative  of  any  issue\r\n\nregarding the  merits of the  government's case on  which the\r\n\nforfeiture is to be based.\"   1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3386.   If\r\n\nthe court elects to \"hold a hearing subsequent to the initial\r\n\nentry of  the order . . .  the court may at  that time modify\r\n\nthe order or vacate an order that was clearly improper (e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nwhere  information presented  at the  hearing shows  that the\r\n\nproperty restrained was  not among the property  named in the\r\n\nindictment).   However, it is stressed that at such a hearing\r\n\nthe court is not  to entertain challenges to the  validity of\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe  indictment.\"   Id.  (emphasis added).    We think  these\r                                   \r\n\nprovisos were meant  to apply to both criminal defendants and\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nthird-party claimants.   The  purpose of a  restraining order\r\n\nproceeding, after  all, is  to preserve at-risk  property for\r\n\ntrial, not to determine whether the property should have been\r\n\nincluded in  the indictment.   Under    853(e)(1)(A), parties\r\n\nclaiming   an   interest   in   restrained   or   potentially\r\n\nrestrainable  property  may  not use  the  restraining  order\r\n\nproceeding to attack the indictment itself.\r\n\n          That is what  the Cunans  tried to do.   Their  res\r                                                                         \r\n\njudicata  claim states,  in essence,  that the  indictment is\r                    \r\n\ninvalid because criminal forfeiture as a  cause of action has\r\n\nvanished.   This  direct challenge  to  the validity  of  the\r\n\nindictment cannot be heard in a restraining order proceeding.\r\n\nTo challenge the forfeitability  of the Maine properties, the\r\n\nCunans must await  the entry  of an order  of forfeiture  and\r\n\npetition  for a hearing under   853(n)(2), at which time they\r\n\nmay press their claim  that they have a superior  interest in\r\n\nthe   properties  as  a  matter  of  res  judicata.    See   \r                                                                      \r\n\n853(n)(6)(A)  (forfeiture  order  shall  be  amended  if  the\r\n\nclaimant's  right, title,  or  interest in  the property  was\r\n\nvested  or superior to  that of the defendant  at the time of\r\n\nthe acts giving  rise to  the forfeiture).

Reckmeyer,  836  F.2d  200,  206 (4th  Cir.  1987)\r                                \r\n\n(noting  that the petitioners'  post-forfeiture claim under  \r\n\n853(n) \"is  a fundamental one that . . . attacks the validity\r\n\nof the forfeiture order itself\").\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          We  acknowledge that  it may  be difficult  in some\r\n\ncases   to  establish  the   proper  limits   of  third-party\r\n\nparticipation in  restraining order proceedings.   On the one\r\n\nhand, premature attacks upon the validity of the indictment -\r\n\n-  the type  of argument  made by  the Cunans --  are clearly\r\n\nbarred.   On the  other, prudential arguments  concerning the\r\n\nburdens of  restraint are  clearly permitted by  the statute,\r\n\nwhich recognizes the due  process concerns that are triggered\r\n\nby  judicial orders aimed at  third parties.   Cf. Regan, 858\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at  121-22 (delineating circumstances  under which  such\r\n\norders should not be  entered).  Some arguments may  not fall\r\n\nneatly on  either side of  the line.   In  Regan itself,  for\r                                                            \r\n\nexample,   the  third-party  claimant,  a  partnership  whose\r\n\npartners included  the criminal defendants, was  permitted to\r\n\nchallenge the potential  forfeitability of partnership assets\r\n\nunder RICO's forfeiture  provision, albeit without  disputing\r\n\nthe factual allegations of the  indictment.  See also  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Wu,  814  F.  Supp.  491,  494  (E.D.

At\r\n\nany rate, the Cunans' res judicata argument falls well on the\r                                              \r\n\nforbidden side of the line.\r\n\n          Our holding is limited to the arguments made by the\r\n\nCunans.  Specifically, the Cunans do not argue, and we do not\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nconsider,  whether  the  Due  Process  Clause  may  sometimes\r\n\nrequire that  interested parties  be given an  opportunity to\r\n\nchallenge  a   restraining  order,  on  the   merits  of  the\r\n\nindictment if  necessary, before  the  entry of  an order  of\r\n\nforfeiture.

Here, the district court permitted the Cunans\r\n\nto participate in the restraining order proceedings; in fact,\r\n\nit granted the Cunans  more process than was provided  by the\r\n\nstatute.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                             \r\n\n          Our holding  moots the  Cunans' appeals in  No. 94-\r\n\n2036  (from Judge Young's  entry of a  restraining order) and\r\n\nNo.  93-2278 (from  Judge Carter's  denial of  the motion  to\r\n\ndisencumber  or release  the Portland assets).   It  does not\r\n\nmatter whether Judge Carter should have granted the motion to\r\n\ndisencumber,  because  Judge  Young  subsequently  entered  a\r\n\nrestraining  order in the Massachusetts prosecution, and that\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\norder cannot be challenged on the sole ground -- res judicata\r                                                                         \r\n\n-- raised  by the Cunans on  appeal.

Count 37 of the indictment -- which named DeCato\r\n\nalone --  sought criminal forfeiture of  the Maine properties\r\n\nunder 21 U.S.C.   853.\r\n\n          Four days  after the  indictment was  returned, the\r\n\ngovernment moved to dismiss  the two civil forfeiture actions\r\n\nwith prejudice, in deference to the criminal forfeiture count\r                          \r\n\nin  Massachusetts.   Judge Carter  so dismissed  the actions.\r\n\nThe United States Marshal for the District of Maine continued\r\n\nto hold the  assets at issue (including escrowed  monies from\r\n\nthe  sale of  some of  the Portland  properties) pursuant  to\r\n\ninstructions from the United States Attorney for the District\r\n\nof Massachusetts.\r\n\n          Several  months  after the  dismissal of  the civil\r\n\nactions,  Cunan moved in the  District of Maine  for an order\r\n\ndirecting  the Maine  Marshal to  disencumber or  release the\r\n\nPortland assets.  He argued that the dismissal with prejudice\r\n\nof the civil actions barred, as a matter of res judicata, the\r                                                                    \r\n\ncriminal  forfeiture  of  those  assets in  the  District  of\r\n\nMassachusetts.   Judge  Carter denied  the motion,  and Cunan\r\n\nappealed the denial in Appeal No. 93-2278.\r\n\n          In  the District  of Massachusetts,  the government\r\n\nmoved  to restrain  all  of the  properties  in the  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture count.  The Cunans moved, on res judicata grounds,\r                                                                \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nto  strike   or  dismiss   the  Maine  properties   from  the\r\n\nindictment.   Judge  Young entered  a  temporary  restraining\r\n\norder,  took   the  Cunans'  motion   under  advisement,  and\r\n\nultimately held  that claim  preclusion  barred the  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture of the Maine properties.\r\n\n          The government moved  for reconsideration,  arguing\r\n\nfor the first time that the Cunans, who are third parties  to\r\n\nCount 37, must wait until an order of forfeiture has actually\r\n\nbeen  entered before  they may  assert their  claim.   See 21\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.   853(k) (barring third-party intervention in criminal\r\n\nforfeiture action  except as  provided in    853(n)).   Judge\r\n\nYoung denied  reconsideration but noted that \"the restraining\r\n\norder already entered remains in full force and effect.\"  The\r\n\ngovernment appealed the dismissal  of the Maine properties in\r\n\nAppeal No. 94-1599.\r\n\n          In  July,  1994,  DeCato  entered  a  written  plea\r\n\nagreement that forfeited \"his legal and beneficial  interests\r\n\nin  all assets  described  in  Count  37,  including  a  cash\r\n\nforfeiture  in the  amount of  $3,000,000.\"   He acknowledged\r\n\nthat all  such  assets were  subject  to forfeiture  as  \"the\r\n\nproceeds of unlawful drug activity . . . and/or as substitute\r\n\nassets.\"  DeCato also agreed to testify against the Cunans at\r\n\ntheir upcoming trial.\r\n\n          The government then filed a supplemental motion  to\r\n\nrestrain   the  Maine   properties,  although   the  previous\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nrestraining  order does not appear  to have been  lifted.  It\r\n\nargued  that notwithstanding any  preclusive effect  from the\r\n\ndismissal of  the civil actions,  the government was  free to\r\n\nforfeit  DeCato's  interest   in  the  Maine   properties  as\r\n\n\"substitute  assets\"   in  place  of  the   $3  million  cash\r\n\nforfeiture.  See 21 U.S.C.   853(p).  Judge Young entered the\r                            \r\n\nrestraining order as requested,  which the Cunans appealed in\r\n\nAppeal No. 94-2036.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                            \r\n\n          We  begin with  the  government's appeal  from  the\r\n\ndismissal of  the  Maine  properties.    In  its  motion  for\r\n\nreconsideration, the  government argued  that the Cunans  are\r\n\nbarred by 21 U.S.C.   853(k) from asserting their third-party\r\n\nclaim  to  the Maine  properties  until  the properties  have\r\n\nactually been  ordered forfeited to  the United  States.   We\r\n\nconsider  this   argument   on  the   merits,   despite   the\r\n\ngovernment's possible waiver below,  for two reasons.  First,\r\n\nthe district  court did  not expressly  rely  upon waiver  in\r\n\ndenying the  motion for reconsideration.   Second, the Cunans\r\n\nhave not asserted waiver on appeal.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We recognize  that the government's  belated argument  is\r\npossibly a  jurisdictional one,  to the extent  that Congress\r\nmay  have barred  the Cunans from  raising, and  the district\r\ncourt from considering, their claim of ownership of the Maine\r\nproperties.

We disagree.\r\n\nA  statutory  exception  to the  bar  is  found  in    853(e)\r\n\n(\"Protective  orders\"):   where the  government seeks  a pre-\r\n\nindictment protective order  against the property alleged  to\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nbe  subject  to forfeiture,  \"persons  appearing  to have  an\r\n\ninterest  in the  property\" must  be  afforded notice  and an\r\n\nopportunity  for a  hearing.     853(e)(1)(B).   There  is no\r\n\nsuggestion that third parties are excluded from this process,\r\n\neven though restraining orders necessarily precede forfeiture\r\n\norders.    In fact,  the legislative  history  of the  bar on\r\n\nthird-party intervention cautions  that \"[t]his provision  is\r\n\nnot  intended to preclude a  third party with  an interest in\r\n\nproperty that is  or may  be subject to  a restraining  order\r\n\nfrom  participating in a hearing regarding the order . . . .\"\r\n\nS.

We now ask whether the Cunans\r\n\nparticipated  in those proceedings in the manner contemplated\r\n\nby Congress.   After examining the  structure and legislative\r\n\nhistory  of   853(e), we  hold that the  Cunans' res judicata\r                                                                         \r\n\nargument was prematurely made.\r\n\n          Broadly   speaking,   the   government   can   seek\r\n\nprotective orders in  two contexts:  before an indictment has\r\n\nbeen filed, or after.  To obtain  a pre-indictment protective\r\n\norder,  the government  must show,  among other  things, that\r\n\n\"there is  a substantial  probability that the  United States\r\n\nwill  prevail  on  the  issue  of forfeiture  .  .  .  .\"    \r\n\n853(e)(1)(B).    By  contrast,   under     853(e)(1)(A),  the\r\n\nindictment itself establishes the merits  of the government's\r\n\ncase,  and courts  may  enter a  protective  order \"upon  the\r\n\nfiling of an indictment . . . alleging that the property with\r\n\nrespect to which  the order is sought would, in  the event of\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nconviction, be subject to forfeiture . . . .\"   The text of  \r\n\n853(e)(1)(A)  nowhere suggests that  participants in  a post-\r\n\nindictment  protective  order  proceeding can  challenge  the\r\n\nunderlying forfeitability  of the property.   That would turn\r\n\nan  ancillary proceeding into the  main event --  a result at\r\n\nodds  with  Congress'  desire   to  \"assure  a  more  orderly\r\n\ndisposition  of  both  the  criminal  case  and  third  party\r\n\nclaims.\"  1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3390.\r\n\n          The legislative history  of   853(e)(1)(A) confirms\r\n\nthis reading, for it expressly limits  the scope of arguments\r\n\nthat can  be raised  by participants in  a post-indictment   \r\n\n853(e)  proceeding.     \"For   the  purposes  of   issuing  a\r\n\nrestraining  order, the  probable  cause  established in  the\r\n\nindictment  . .  .  is  to  be  determinative  of  any  issue\r\n\nregarding the  merits of the  government's case on  which the\r\n\nforfeiture is to be based.\"   1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3386.   If\r\n\nthe court elects to \"hold a hearing subsequent to the initial\r\n\nentry of  the order . . .  the court may at  that time modify\r\n\nthe order or vacate an order that was clearly improper (e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nwhere  information presented  at the  hearing shows  that the\r\n\nproperty restrained was  not among the property  named in the\r\n\nindictment).

The  purpose of a  restraining order\r\n\nproceeding, after  all, is  to preserve at-risk  property for\r\n\ntrial, not to determine whether the property should have been\r\n\nincluded in  the indictment.   Under    853(e)(1)(A), parties\r\n\nclaiming   an   interest   in   restrained   or   potentially\r\n\nrestrainable  property  may  not use  the  restraining  order\r\n\nproceeding to attack the indictment itself.\r\n\n          That is what  the Cunans  tried to do.

This  direct challenge  to  the validity  of  the\r\n\nindictment cannot be heard in a restraining order proceeding.\r\n\nTo challenge the forfeitability  of the Maine properties, the\r\n\nCunans must await  the entry  of an order  of forfeiture  and\r\n\npetition  for a hearing under   853(n)(2), at which time they\r\n\nmay press their claim  that they have a superior  interest in\r\n\nthe   properties  as  a  matter  of  res  judicata.

See also  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Wu,  814  F.  Supp.  491,  494  (E.D.  Va.  1993)\r                          \r\n\n(speculating  that the  third-party spouse  of  the defendant\r\n\nmight  be   entitled  to   intervene  in   restraining  order\r\n\nproceeding in order to contest the breadth of the order).  At\r\n\nany rate, the Cunans' res judicata argument falls well on the\r                                              \r\n\nforbidden side of the line.\r\n\n          Our holding is limited to the arguments made by the\r\n\nCunans.  Specifically, the Cunans do not argue, and we do not\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nconsider,  whether  the  Due  Process  Clause  may  sometimes\r\n\nrequire that  interested parties  be given an  opportunity to\r\n\nchallenge  a   restraining  order,  on  the   merits  of  the\r\n\nindictment if  necessary, before  the  entry of  an order  of\r\n\nforfeiture.

Here, the district court permitted the Cunans\r\n\nto participate in the restraining order proceedings; in fact,\r\n\nit granted the Cunans  more process than was provided  by the\r\n\nstatute.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                             \r\n\n          Our holding  moots the  Cunans' appeals in  No. 94-\r\n\n2036  (from Judge Young's  entry of a  restraining order) and\r\n\nNo.  93-2278 (from  Judge Carter's  denial of  the motion  to\r\n\ndisencumber  or release  the Portland assets).
