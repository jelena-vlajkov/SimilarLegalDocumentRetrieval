George  H. Bennett  and Lionel\r                                       \r\n\nLussier   were  each  charged   with  conspiracy  to  possess\r\n\nmarijuana  with  intent  to  distribute,  21  U.S.C.     846;\r\n\ncarrying or using a firearm during and in relation to  a drug\r\n\ntrafficking  offense,  18  U.S.C.    924(c)(1);  and unlawful\r\n\npossession of a  firearm by  a convicted felon,  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n922(g)(1).   The charges  stemmed from  a bizarre March  1994\r\n\nepisode in  which  Bennett, Lussier,  and  Gary King,  in  an\r\n\nattempt to avenge a  previous drug-related attack and robbery\r\n\nagainst mutual  friend Ronald Madore,  mistakenly entered the\r\n\nwrong home and  assaulted the occupants,  ultimately shooting\r\n\none of them through the finger.  \r\n\n     Madore and King were indicted for various offenses; both\r\n\npled guilty,  cooperated with the prosecution,  and testified\r\n\nagainst  Bennett and Lussier.  After a five-day jury trial in\r\n\nAugust 1994, Bennett and Lussier were convicted on all counts\r\n\nand sentenced, respectively, to 360 and 378 months in prison.\r\n\nIn  this consolidated  appeal, Bennett and  Lussier challenge\r\n\ntheir convictions and sentences on many  grounds.  We address\r\n\nthe more  colorable of these claims,  setting forth pertinent\r\n\nfacts as necessary.\r\n\n     First.    Both   Bennett  and   Lussier  challenge   the\r                      \r\n\nsufficiency of  the  evidence supporting  conviction on  each\r\n\ncount.  Neither denies participating in the assault  but they\r\n\ndispute issues  of  intent  and their  precise  role  in  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nevents.  Our  familiar task  on review of  sufficiency is  to\r\n\nconsider  the record as a whole and to determine, viewing the\r\n\nevidence in the light most  favorable to the verdict, whether\r\n\na rational  jury could find guilt beyond  a reasonable doubt.\r\n\nUnited States  v. Luciano-Mosquera,  63 F.3d 1142,  1149 (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir. 1995).\r\n\n     A  conspiracy  conviction  can be  supported  by  either\r\n\ndirect or circumstantial evidence of an illegal agreement--in\r\n\nthis  case to  possess marijuana  with intent  to distribute.\r\n\nSee United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 506 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                     \r\n\nAt trial, there was testimony that on the day of the mistaken\r\n\nraid,  Bennett,  Lussier,  and  King, along  with  two  other\r\n\nfriends, drank  and discussed seeking revenge  for a previous\r\n\nattack  in which  mutual friend  Ronald Madore,  a small-time\r\n\nmarijuana dealer, was beaten  and robbed of marijuana, money,\r\n\nand  guns.   The  group  continued their  drinking  and their\r\n\ndiscussion that evening at Madore's house.\r\n\n     Madore testified that Bennett, Lussier, and King planned\r\n\nto beat up the  man Madore suspected was behind  the previous\r\n\nattack,  one Wayne Hathorne, take any marijuana he had (along\r\n\nwith  any money) and give the marijuana to Madore so he could\r\n\nsell it  and share the proceeds.   King's testimony regarding\r\n\nthe plan was  less definitive;  he stated at  one point  that\r\n\nthey only intended to beat Hathorne, but elsewhere  that both\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\ndiscussed  stealing  Hathorne's marijuana  and  giving  it to\r\n\nMadore because \"[h]e deals in it.\"\r\n\n     It is  undisputed that shortly  after this  conversation\r\n\nthe  four men--the appellants, Madore and King--left Madore's\r\n\nhouse in Bennett's  car and  drove to a  trailer home,  which\r\n\nthey mistakenly believed was Hathorne's.  While Madore waited\r\n\nin the car, Bennett, Lussier and King entered the trailer and\r\n\nterrorized  occupants  David Wing,  Michelle Morin  and their\r\n\nchildren, physically  assaulting Wing  and Morin while  a gun\r\n\nwas  held  to Wing's  head.   There was  testimony, described\r\n\nlater in this opinion, that all four men knew of the proposal\r\n\nto  bring a gun and that  first King and then Lussier carried\r\n\nthe weapon.\r\n\n     Wing testified that during the attack all three men were\r\n\nshouting \"[w]here  is our  dope?\"; Morin heard  them shouting\r\n\nabout drugs  but did  not specify  whether it was  particular\r\n\nindividuals  or  all of  them.   Wing and  Morin, who  had no\r\n\ndrugs, tried  to convince their assailants they had the wrong\r\n\nhouse.  These pleas were met with a  threat to kill Wing.  In\r\n\nan ensuing struggle  for the  gun Wing was  shot through  the\r\n\nfinger.  Bennett, Lussier and King immediately fled the scene\r\n\nwithout taking anything.  \r\n\n     Appellants now insist, as they  argued to the jury, that\r\n\nthe  plan was  merely to  beat Hathorne  and did  not include\r\n\nseizing drugs, and that  much of the testimony of  Madore and\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nKing was false.  But such credibility assessments are for the\r\n\njury  and  nothing  here  justifies  disturbing   the  jury's\r\n\nrational conclusion that Bennett and Lussier joined in a plan\r\n\nto, among other things, steal marijuana and give it to Madore\r\n\nto sell.  \r\n\n     As to the section 924(c)(1) charge of carrying  or using\r\n\na  gun during a drug  crime, Lussier concedes the sufficiency\r\n\nof  the evidence  against him,  while Bennett  maintains that\r\n\nnothing showed that he had carried or used  a gun in relation\r                                  \r\n\nto the marijuana  conspiracy.  But  Bennett was also  charged\r\n\nwith aiding and abetting the carry or use offense.  Thus, his\r\n\nconviction  can be sustained under  18 U.S.C.    2 if Bennett\r\n\nknew a firearm would  be carried or used by  a co-conspirator\r\n\nin  the  drug trafficking  offense  and  willingly took  some\r\n\naction to facilitate the  carriage or use.  Luciano-Mosquera,\r                                                                        \r\n\n63 F.3d at 1150.\r\n\n     At  trial there was testimony  that the gun  used in the\r\n\nattack  was taken  from  a  couch  in  Madore's  house  under\r\n\ncircumstances  where  Bennett could  have  seen  it.   Madore\r\n\ntestified  that he told  the other three they  did not need a\r\n\ngun, but  each said he would  rather take it.   King held the\r\n\ngun on the ride to Wing's home while sitting in the passenger\r\n\nseat beside driver Bennett; King said that he did not conceal\r\n\nthe gun in the car, although he conceded he may at some point\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nhave  placed it in his waistband.   It was his impression the\r\n\nothers were aware he had the gun.  \r\n\n     From this evidence  a jury could find  that Bennett knew\r\n\nthat one of  his companions  was carrying the  gun when  they\r\n\ncommitted   the  attack,  and   facilitation  is  essentially\r\n\nundisputed  since  Bennett  provided  his  car  to  transport\r\n\nhimself,  his co-conspirators,  and  the gun  to execute  the\r\n\nraid.  In Luciano Mosquera, we upheld  an abetting conviction\r                                      \r\n\nbecause the defendant provided a house for meeting where guns\r\n\nwere  displayed and  discussed,  and later  used during  drug\r\n\ntrafficking crime.  63 F.3d at  1150.  In sum, once knowledge\r\n\non the part of the aider and abettor is  established, it does\r\n\nnot take much to satisfy the facilitation element.  \r\n\n     With respect  to adequacy  of evidence on  the felon-in-\r\n\npossession charge, 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1), Bennett and Lussier\r\n\nmake only  the  narrow  claim that  the  evidence  failed  to\r\n\nestablish that the gun  had travelled in interstate commerce,\r\n\nthe  jurisdictional element of that offense.  The gun was not\r\n\nintroduced into evidence since it had  been discarded by King\r\n\nand  Madore.  But from direct testimony the jury was entitled\r\n\nto  find that it was a .22 caliber \"Single-Six\" made by Sterm\r\n\nRuger and that Sterm Ruger was an out-of-state manufacturer.\r\n\n     Appellants argue that the gun  could have been a replica\r\n\nfashioned by  an in-state gunsmith.   This remote possibility\r\n\nhad  only the  most  tenuous evidentiary  support, namely,  a\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nwitness or  two said such  a gun could  be fabricated  but at\r                                                  \r\n\nsignificant cost.  The  overwhelming probability was that the\r\n\ngun was authentic and  had been transported--at some time--in\r\n\ninterstate  commerce.   Certainly the jury's  conclusion that\r\n\nthe gun was  genuine and had previously  traveled in commerce\r\n\nwas  not irrational.  Cf.  United States v.  Kirvan, 997 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n963, 966-67 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n     Second.    Shortly  into  its  deliberations,  the  jury\r                       \r\n\nrequested the testimony of victims Wing and Morin.  The trial\r\n\njudge conferred with counsel and then  instructed the jury to\r\n\nuse  their recollections,  adding that  he would  provide the\r\n\nrequested  testimony if  the jury  still found  it necessary.\r\n\nAfter  further  deliberations the  jury  asked  for only  the\r\n\ndirect testimony of Wing and Morin.  Over defense objections,\r\n\nthe judge then  had the  direct testimony of  Wing and  Morin\r\n\nread  back to the jury.  Immediately after the read-back, the\r\n\njudge asked jurors as a group whether they would also like to\r\n\nhear  the cross or other testimony of the two witnesses; none\r\n\ndid.  Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, which was denied.\r\n\n     The appellants  concede that  it would have  been within\r\n\nthe  trial judge's discretion to have read to the jury all of\r                                                                      \r\n\nWing and Morin's testimony; but they say that providing  only\r\n\nthe     direct    examination     was    prejudicial--indeed,\r\n\nunconstitutional--because   the    unread   cross-examination\r\n\nresponses of both witnesses  were at \"striking variance\" with\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\ntheir testimony on direct.  No examples of such variances are\r\n\nmentioned.   No case law is provided to suggest that the jury\r\n\nmay not select what it wishes to hear.\r\n\n     The  trial judge's  decision whether or  not to  grant a\r\n\nrequest  to  read  back  testimony requested  by  a  jury  is\r\n\nreviewed for  abuse of discretion, United  States v. Akitoye,\r                                                                        \r\n\n723 F.2d 221, 226 (1st Cir. 1991); and we think  that this is\r\n\nequally true of the judge's decision whether  the jury should\r\n\nbe made to hear  additional, related testimony that the  jury\r\n\nmade  clear it  did  not need  to  rehear.   Of  course, such\r\n\ndiscretion is not  unlimited.  And certainly the  trial judge\r\n\nshould  exercise great  care when  the testimony  the defense\r\n\ncounsel wants the  jury to hear  is the cross-examination  of\r\n\nthe very witnesses whose full  direct testimony has just been\r\n\nreread.\r\n\n     But no inflexible rule exists that the cross must always\r\n\nbe read.  United  States v. Wright-Barker, 784 F.2d  161, 174\r                                                     \r\n\n(3d Cir. 1986).  In plenty of cases, the direct testimony  of\r\n\nanother witness might be  far more relevant in  assessing the\r                   \r\n\ntestimony of the witness  whose testimony the jury requested.\r\n\nEach case  must  be  decided on  its  facts, and  it  is  the\r\n\nappellant's  burden  to  show  that  the  trial  judge  acted\r\n\nunreasonably.  Here on appeal,  with ample leisure to compare\r\n\nthe direct and cross of Wing and Morin, appellate counsel has\r\n\nstill made  no specific showing  as to  why it was  unfair in\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nthis case  for the  district court to  omit cross-examination\r                     \r\n\nthat the jury did not want.\r\n\n     Because this is a criminal case, we have read the direct\r\n\nand cross-examination of the two witnesses in order to assure\r               \r\n\nourselves that the district court's  action did not cause any\r\n\nmiscarriage of  justice.  We  have found  nothing to  suggest\r\n\nthat the  cross-examination was vital or  contained more than\r\n\nthe customary measure of minor variations or inconsistencies.\r\n\nPrior  to requesting  the  read-backs, the  jury could  quite\r\n\nreasonably have  concluded that it  credited these witnesses'\r\n\ndirect testimony--they had no  reason to lie--and then sought\r\n\nthe read-back to refresh the  jury's own recollection on some\r\n\nspecific points.\r\n\n     There  is no merit in two other related claims of error.\r\n\nAppellants  now say that the jury  was confused or bewildered\r\n\nby the trial  judge's offer to have the cross reread; but the\r\n\ntrial judge found otherwise.   We have read the  colloquy and\r\n\nfind  no  reason  to  doubt  the  trial  judge's  conclusion.\r\n\nAppellants also say that the jury  should have been cautioned\r\n\nnot to give the direct testimony special weight, e.g., United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. DeSoto, 885  F.2d 354, 363 (7th Cir.  1989), but no\r                            \r\n\nsuch request was made at trial.\r\n\n     Third.   In  closing, the  prosecutor  referred  several\r                      \r\n\ntimes,  without objection,  to the  \"selective focus\"  of the\r\n\ndefense.   In  rebuttal, the  prosecutor described  a defense\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nargument as a \"diversion\" that \"doesn't  pass the laugh test\"\r\n\nand  again  referred  to  the  defense's  \"selective  focus.\"\r\n\nDefense  counsel  immediately  objected  to  the  \"diversion\"\r\n\nremark.   After the  summations, defense counsel  requested a\r\n\ncurative instruction that the jury disregard these remarks to\r\n\nthe  extent that  they \"degraded  legitimate defenses.\"   The\r\n\njudge found  the comments  unobjectionable and gave  only the\r\n\nstandard  instruction  that  arguments  of  counsel  are  not\r\n\nevidence.\r\n\n     Appellants now  maintain that both  of the  prosecutor's\r\n\nremarks improperly denigrated defense  counsel as well as the\r\n\ndefense strategy.  The prosecutor is expected to refrain from\r\n\nimpugning, directly or through  implication, the integrity or\r\n\ninstitutional  role of  defense  counsel.   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nBoldt,  929  F.2d 35,  40 (1st  Cir.  1991).   But \"selective\r                 \r\n\nfocus\" remarks were  part of  a larger metaphor  used by  the\r\n\nprosecutor in urging the  jury to \"act as a camera\"  and keep\r\n\n\"focused\" on  the evidence.   In context, the  remarks merely\r\n\necho  the truism  that  lawyers highlight  helpful facts  and\r\n\nretreat from unfavorable ones.\r\n\n     The prosecutor  edged closer to trouble  in his rebuttal\r\n\nremarks by calling a defense argument a \"diversion\" that does\r\n\nnot  \"pass the  laugh test.\"   But  summations in  litigation\r\n\noften have  a rough and tumble  quality; in fact,  one of the\r\n\ndefense  summations here  twice referred to  the government's\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n\"desperation\" to prove charges \"they can't prove.\"  We do not\r\n\nthink  that the prosecutor's remarks on this case crossed the\r\n\nline.   See generally United States  v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  436, 440-41 (1st Cir.  1993), cert. denied,  114 S. Ct.\r                                                            \r\n\n1366  (1994).   Nor  was the  refusal  to give  the specially\r\n\nrequested instruction reversible error;  indeed, a jury would\r\n\nnot have made much sense of the requested language.\r\n\n     Fourth.  At trial Bennett and Lussier sought access to a\r                       \r\n\npolice  interview  report  with  a  government witness,  Pete\r\n\nMcFarlane,  a  friend of  the  appellants who  was  with them\r\n\nbefore  and  immediately after  the  attack.   The  interview\r\n\nreport, the  defendants believed, might have  some bearing on\r\n\nMcFarlane's  testimony that  Lussier  admitted  in the  post-\r\n\nattack  meeting that  he was  holding the  gun when  Wing was\r\n\nshot.   Defendants urged that  the interview report  might be\r\n\ndiscoverable  under Fed. R. Crim.  P. 16, the  Jencks Act, 18\r                                                                 \r\n\nU.S.C.   3500, or Brady v. Maryland,  373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).\r                                               \r\n\nThe trial judge reviewed  the report in camera and  concluded\r                                                          \r\n\nthat it was not discoverable.\r\n\n     On  appeal, all  three bases  for disclosure  are urged.\r\n\nRule  16  does not  apply  since  its pertinent  language  is\r\n\ndirected  to  statements  made  by  a  defendant  to  a known\r\n\ngovernment agent,  United States v.  Burns, 15 F.3d  211 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir. 1994), and a statement by Lussier or  any co-conspirator\r\n\nto McFarlane immediately after the event is not even arguably\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nin that category.  Appellants suggest that Burns demands more\r                                                            \r\n\nof the  government than  the bare minimum  prescribed in  the\r\n\nrule; but  that is not what  Burns says.  Compare  15 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n215-16 n. 2.   The  Jencks Act requires inter alia production\r                                                              \r\n\nof  writings that  are \"substantially  verbatim\"  recitals of\r\n\npre-trial statements  made by  a government witness  and that\r\n\nrelate  to the subject of  the witness' trial  testimony.  18\r\n\nU.S.C.   3500(e)(2).  We  have reviewed the interview  report\r\n\nat issue which contains only a few isolated direct quotations\r\n\n(none  pertinent here)  and which  is neither  structured nor\r\n\nphrased as  a verbatim report.   In our view the  trial court\r\n\ndid  not commit clear error in refusing to treat the six-page\r\n\nreport  as  a  substantially   verbatim  recordation  of  the\r\n\ninterviewee's own  words.   See United  States v.  Foley, 871\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 235, 238-39 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\n\n     Lussier offers a  clever gloss on the Jencks Act, urging\r\n\nthat  any  simple  statement  in  an  interview report--e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n\"Lussier  held  the  gun\"--must  because of  its  brevity  be\r\n\nessentially  verbatim and  thus discoverable  under  the Act.\r\n\nBut  this attempt to divide up the document has been rejected\r\n\neven in  the case of  isolated direct quotations,  Foley, 871\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 238-39.  We note also that the report (a formal typed\r\n\nform) was clearly made after the interview and not during it.\r\n\nUnited States  v. Consolidated  Packaging, 575 F.2d  117, 129\r                                                     \r\n\n(7th Cir. 1978) (requiring a contemporaneous recordation).\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n     The  Brady claim  is more  difficult for  the government\r                           \r\n\nbecause the  interview report  does say that  Lussier carried\r\n\nthe gun,  but attributes  that information to  Bennett rather\r\n\nthan  Lussier.   The report  might thus  appear to  have some\r\n\nimpeachment value, possibly qualifying  it as Brady  material\r                                                               \r\n\nunder United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 677 (1985).  The\r                                         \r\n\ninference  is pretty limited in  this case: not  only was the\r\n\nmeeting  a confusing one  but the  interview report  does not\r\n\nexclude--and  may  even  invite--the inference  that  Lussier\r\n\nacquiesced in the  suggestion that he  had been carrying  the\r\n\ngun.\r\n\n     In  all events, even if we assume that the report should\r\n\nhave  been produced  under Brady,  the failure  to do  so was\r                                            \r\n\nharmless.   At trial,  both Bennett  and King  testified that\r\n\nLussier  had held the gun;  and while Bennett  had a personal\r\n\ninterest  in  so testifying,  King  did  not.    Further,  if\r\n\nMcFarlane had been \"impeached\" by the report in question, the\r\n\njury  would have been told, once again, that Lussier had held\r\n\nthe  gun.   At  the  post-attack meeting,  where  Lussier was\r\n\npresent, Bennett had no reason to lie and  good reason not to\r\n\ndo so.\r\n\n     Fifth.   The last  noteworthy issue concerns  the aiding\r                      \r\n\nand abetting instructions.   Bennett and Lussier were charged\r\n\nin both firearms counts--the possession and the use  or carry\r\n\ncounts--both  as principals  and  on an  aiding and  abetting\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\ntheory under 18 U.S.C.   2.  As to both gun offenses, Bennett\r\n\nand  Lussier say  that  the aiding  and abetting  instruction\r\n\npermitted the  jury to convict without  the required scienter\r\n\n(for example,  even if the jury believed  that the assistance\r\n\nwas unintentionally rendered).\r\n\n     On the  possession  count,  the  jury was  told  that  a\r\n\ndefendant could  be convicted if he  \"knowingly possessed the\r\n\nfirearm . . . or aided and abetted such possession\"; parallel\r\n\nlanguage was  used on the companion count (\"knowingly used or\r\n\ncarried  a firearm or aided and abetted the use or carrying a\r\n\nfirearm\").  The appellants complain that the word \"knowingly\"\r\n\nwas not used  immediately before \"aided and  abetted\" in each\r\n\ninstance;  but   this  is  irrelevant  because   \"aiding  and\r\n\nabetting\" was  separately defined in the  instructions, which\r\n\nmust be read as a whole.   United States v. Fontana, 948 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n796, 801 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n\n     In  the  aiding  and  abetting  definition  itself,  the\r\n\ndistrict court charged in pertinent part that \"the Government\r\n\nmust  prove  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  a  defendant\r\n\nassociated himself  with the  venture, participated in  it as\r\n\nsomething  that he wished to  bring about, and  sought by his\r\n\nactions to make it succeed.\"  This language obviously imports\r\n\na scienter element  (\"wished to bring about\";  \"sought by his\r\n\nactions\"), and  it is the  precise language approved  by this\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\ncourt in prior cases.  E.g., United States v.  Loder, 23 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n586, 590-91 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n     But  our journey is not quite over.  The Loder language,\r                                                               \r\n\nwhich  serves reasonably  well  in most  situations, may  not\r\n\nperfectly cover  abnormal ones.  Here,  a potential ambiguity\r\n\nexists: the term \"venture\" in Loder is intended  as catch-all\r                                               \r\n\nfor  the  notion  of  a  crime  committed  by  another  (\"the\r\n\nprincipal\")  for  which  the  government  aims  to  hold  the\r\n\ndefendant  responsible as  an  aider or  abettor, making  the\r\n\ndefendant  \"punishable as a principal.\"  18 U.S.C.    2.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\ngenerally 1  Sand, et.  al, Modern Federal  Jury Instructions\r                                                                         \r\n\npara. 11.01 (1995).   Where only a single crime  is involved,\r\n\nconfusion is unlikely under Loder's language because there is\r                                             \r\n\nonly one venture.\r\n\n     Here, however, the defendants  were charged in the first\r\n\ncount  with a drug possession conspiracy.  In theory the term\r\n\n\"venture,\"  used only as  part of  the general  definition of\r\n\naiding  and abetting,  might lead  a jury  to think  that the\r\n\nventure  in  question was  the  drug conspiracy  and  not the\r\n\npossession or use-and-carry  offense.  If so, the  jury might\r\n\nalso  think that it could  convict the defendant  who did not\r                                                                         \r\n\npersonally possess  or use  or carry  a gun,  so long  as the\r\n\naider or abettor \"wished to  bring about\" the drug possession\r\n\n\"and sought by his actions to make [that venture] succeed.\" \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\n     The problem, needless to say, is not that any element of\r\n\nthe offense was omitted from the charge, cf. United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nLopez, No. 94-2277, slip op. at  12 (1st Cir. Dec. 14, 1995),\r                 \r\n\nbut  that a  possible ambiguity  inhered in  the instruction.\r\n\nThe defendants  made several timely objections  to the aiding\r\n\nand abetting  instructions at trial, although  their proposed\r\n\nsolutions were of questionable use.  But any ambiguity in the\r\n\ncharge was  irrelevant in Lussier's case  (the only evidence,\r\n\nobviously  accepted   by  the  jury,  was  that  he  was  the\r\n\nprincipal), and it was harmless in Bennett's case.\r\n\n     Given   the  evidence,  Bennett  could  only  have  been\r\n\nconvicted as an aider and abettor.  But--as already related--\r\n\nMadore, who supplied the gun, testified that bringing it  had\r\n\nbeen discussed in advance and  that Bennett, Lussier and King\r\n\nall  said they  wanted  it brought;  King,  who sat  next  to\r\n\nBennett in the  car, testified that he carried the gun in his\r\n\nlap  without  concealment  for  at least  part  of  the ride.\r\n\nUnlike Bennett, who claimed  to have had no knowledge  of the\r\n\ngun,  King and  Madore were not  on trial.   If  there was an\r\n\nambiguity in the instruction, it did not affect the result.\r\n\n     Appellants' remaining claims have been considered but do\r\n\nnot require discussion.  In a few instances, Bennett has made\r\n\nclaims  that are  not fully  developed, such  as his  cursory\r\n\nattack  on  the  intoxication  instruction,  or  beyond   our\r\n\njurisdiction (e.g.,  the refusal  of  a downward  departure).\r                              \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nOther claims  made by  appellants are properly  presented but\r\n\nseem to  us  hopeless  on  the  facts  (e.g.,  that  perjured\r                                                        \r\n\ntestimony was knowingly presented) or the law (the claim that\r\n\nsection  922(g)(1)  is  unconstitutional).    Scarborough  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nUnited  States,  431 U.S.  563  (1977)  (discussed in  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 919 (1995)).\r                           \r\n\n     The case for  appellants here has been well presented by\r\n\ncounsel, and we understand the practical pressure on lawyers-\r\n\n-especially in criminal cases--to  resolve doubts in favor of\r\n\nincluding  doubtful claims  along  with stronger  ones.   But\r\n\ncases  with difficult issues now crowd the dockets.  At least\r\n\nin opinion  writing, the  court's time  is best  reserved for\r\n\ncolorable  claims.  Cf. McIntosh  v.

App. P.\r\n\n28(i) to  incorporate Lussier's brief generally  as to \"those\r\n\nfacts, issues and  arguments . .  . that  may inure to  [his]\r\n\nbenefit\" and  to  adopt  particular  arguments  in  Lussier's\r\n\nbrief.     The   motion,   previously   denied   subject   to\r\n\nreconsideration, is effectively moot  since none of Lussier's\r\n\nclaims have  been accepted.   But  future counsel  using Rule\r\n\n28(i)  should be aware of  the need to  connect the arguments\r\n\nadopted  with the  specific facts  pertaining to  the movant.\r\n\nUnited States  v.

McCloskey, United States Attorney, was on consolidated brief for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges, and SARIS,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> District Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George H. Bennett and Lionel Lussier were each charged with conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846;  carrying or using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1);  and unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).   The charges stemmed from a bizarre March 1994 episode in which Bennett, Lussier, and Gary King, in an attempt to avenge a previous drug-related attack and robbery against mutual friend Ronald Madore, mistakenly entered the wrong home and assaulted the occupants, ultimately shooting one of them through the finger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Madore and King were indicted for various offenses;  both pled guilty, cooperated with the prosecution, and testified against Bennett and Lussier.   After a five-day jury trial in August 1994, Bennett and Lussier were convicted on all counts and sentenced, respectively, to 360 and 378 months in prison.   In this consolidated appeal, Bennett and Lussier challenge their convictions and sentences on many grounds.   We address the more colorable of these claims, setting forth pertinent facts as necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First.   Both Bennett and Lussier challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting conviction on each count.   Neither denies participating in the assault but they dispute issues of intent and their precise role in the events.   Our familiar task on review of sufficiency is to consider the record as a whole and to determine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1149 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conspiracy conviction can be supported by either direct or circumstantial evidence of an illegal agreement--in this case to possess marijuana with intent to distribute.   See United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 506 (1st Cir.1990).   At trial, there was testimony that on the day of the mistaken raid, Bennett, Lussier, and King, along with two other friends, drank and discussed seeking revenge for a previous attack in which mutual friend Ronald Madore, a small-time marijuana dealer, was beaten and robbed of marijuana, money, and guns.   The group continued their drinking and their discussion that evening at Madore's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Madore testified that Bennett, Lussier, and King planned to beat up the man Madore suspected was behind the previous attack, one Wayne Hathorne, take any marijuana he had (along with any money) and give the marijuana to Madore so he could sell it and share the proceeds.   King's testimony regarding the plan was less definitive;  he stated at one point that they only intended to beat Hathorne, but elsewhere that both discussed stealing Hathorne's marijuana and giving it to Madore because \"[h]e deals in it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that shortly after this conversation the four men--the appellants, Madore and King--left Madore's house in Bennett's car and drove to a trailer home, which they mistakenly believed was Hathorne's.   While Madore waited in the car, Bennett, Lussier and King entered the trailer and terrorized occupants David Wing, Michelle Morin and their children, physically assaulting Wing and Morin while a gun was held to Wing's head.   There was testimony, described later in this opinion, that all four men knew of the proposal to bring a gun and that first King and then Lussier carried the weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wing testified that during the attack all three men were shouting \"[w]here is our dope?\";  Morin heard them shouting about drugs but did not specify whether it was particular individuals or all of them.   Wing and Morin, who had no drugs, tried to convince their assailants they had the wrong house.   These pleas were met with a threat to kill Wing.   In an ensuing struggle for the gun Wing was shot through the finger.   Bennett, Lussier and King immediately fled the scene without taking anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants now insist, as they argued to the jury, that the plan was merely to beat Hathorne and did not include seizing drugs, and that much of the testimony of Madore and King was false.   But such credibility assessments are for the jury and nothing here justifies disturbing the jury's rational conclusion that Bennett and Lussier joined in a plan to, among other things, steal marijuana and give it to Madore to sell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the section 924(c)(1) charge of carrying or using a gun during a drug crime, Lussier concedes the sufficiency of the evidence against him, while Bennett maintains that nothing showed that he had carried or used a gun in relation to the marijuana conspiracy.   But Bennett was also charged with aiding and abetting the carry or use offense.   Thus, his conviction can be sustained under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 if Bennett knew a firearm would be carried or used by a co-conspirator in the drug trafficking offense and willingly took some action to facilitate the carriage or use.  Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d at 1150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial there was testimony that the gun used in the attack was taken from a couch in Madore's house under circumstances where Bennett could have seen it.   Madore testified that he told the other three they did not need a gun, but each said he would rather take it.   King held the gun on the ride to Wing's home while sitting in the passenger seat beside driver Bennett;  King said that he did not conceal the gun in the car, although he conceded he may at some point have placed it in his waistband.   It was his impression the others were aware he had the gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this evidence a jury could find that Bennett knew that one of his companions was carrying the gun when they committed the attack, and facilitation is essentially undisputed since Bennett provided his car to transport himself, his co-conspirators, and the gun to execute the raid.   In Luciano Mosquera, we upheld an abetting conviction because the defendant provided a house for meeting where guns were displayed and discussed, and later used during drug trafficking crime.  63 F.3d at 1150.   In sum, once knowledge on the part of the aider and abettor is established, it does not take much to satisfy the facilitation element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to adequacy of evidence on the felon-in-possession charge, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), Bennett and Lussier make only the narrow claim that the evidence failed to establish that the gun had travelled in interstate commerce, the jurisdictional element of that offense.   The gun was not introduced into evidence since it had been discarded by King and Madore.   But from direct testimony the jury was entitled to find that it was a .22 caliber \"Single-Six\" made by Sturm Ruger and that Sturm Ruger was an out-of-state manufacturer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the gun could have been a replica fashioned by an in-state gunsmith.   This remote possibility had only the most tenuous evidentiary support, namely, a witness or two said such a gun could be fabricated but at significant cost.   The overwhelming probability was that the gun was authentic and had been transported--at some time--in interstate commerce.   Certainly the jury's conclusion that the gun was genuine and had previously traveled in commerce was not irrational.   Cf. United States v. Kirvan, 997 F.2d 963, 966-67 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second.   Shortly into its deliberations, the jury requested the testimony of victims Wing and Morin.   The trial judge conferred with counsel and then instructed the jury to use their recollections, adding that he would provide the requested testimony if the jury still found it necessary.   After further deliberations the jury asked for only the direct testimony of Wing and Morin.   Over defense objections, the judge then had the direct testimony of Wing and Morin read back to the jury.   Immediately after the read-back, the judge asked jurors as a group whether they would also like to hear the cross or other testimony of the two witnesses;  none did.   Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, which was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants concede that it would have been within the trial judge's discretion to have read to the jury all of Wing and Morin's testimony;  but they say that providing only the direct examination was prejudicial--indeed, unconstitutional--because the unread cross-examination responses of both witnesses were at \"striking variance\" with their testimony on direct.   No examples of such variances are mentioned.   No case law is provided to suggest that the jury may not select what it wishes to hear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge's decision whether or not to grant a request to read back testimony requested by a jury is reviewed for abuse of discretion, United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 226 (1st Cir.1991);  and we think that this is equally true of the judge's decision whether the jury should be made to hear additional, related testimony that the jury made clear it did not need to rehear.   Of course, such discretion is not unlimited.   And certainly the trial judge should exercise great care when the testimony the defense counsel wants the jury to hear is the cross-examination of the very witnesses whose full direct testimony has just been reread.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But no inflexible rule exists that the cross must always be read.  United States v. Wright-Barker, 784 F.2d 161, 174 (3d Cir.1986).   In plenty of cases, the direct testimony of another witness might be far more relevant in assessing the testimony of the witness whose testimony the jury requested.   Each case must be decided on its facts, and it is the appellant's burden to show that the trial judge acted unreasonably.   Here on appeal, with ample leisure to compare the direct and cross of Wing and Morin, appellate counsel has still made no specific showing as to why it was unfair in this case for the district court to omit cross-examination that the jury did not want.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is a criminal case, we have read the direct and cross-examination of the two witnesses in order to assure ourselves that the district court's action did not cause any miscarriage of justice.   We have found nothing to suggest that the cross-examination was vital or contained more than the customary measure of minor variations or inconsistencies.   Prior to requesting the read-backs, the jury could quite reasonably have concluded that it credited these witnesses' direct testimony--they had no reason to lie--and then sought the read-back to refresh the jury's own recollection on some specific points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no merit in two other related claims of error.   Appellants now say that the jury was confused or bewildered by the trial judge's offer to have the cross reread;  but the trial judge found otherwise.   We have read the colloquy and find no reason to doubt the trial judge's conclusion.   Appellants also say that the jury should have been cautioned not to give the direct testimony special weight, e.g., United States v. DeSoto, 885 F.2d 354, 363 (7th Cir.1989), but no such request was made at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third.   In closing, the prosecutor referred several times, without objection, to the \"selective focus\" of the defense.   In rebuttal, the prosecutor described a defense argument as a \"diversion\" that \"doesn't pass the laugh test\" and again referred to the defense's \"selective focus.\"   Defense counsel immediately objected to the \"diversion\" remark.   After the summations, defense counsel requested a curative instruction that the jury disregard these remarks to the extent that they \"degraded legitimate defenses.\"   The judge found the comments unobjectionable and gave only the standard instruction that arguments of counsel are not evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants now maintain that both of the prosecutor's remarks improperly denigrated defense counsel as well as the defense strategy.   The prosecutor is expected to refrain from impugning, directly or through implication, the integrity or institutional role of defense counsel.  United States v. Boldt, 929 F.2d 35, 40 (1st Cir.1991).   But \"selective focus\" remarks were part of a larger metaphor used by the prosecutor in urging the jury to \"act as a camera\" and keep \"focused\" on the evidence.   In context, the remarks merely echo the truism that lawyers highlight helpful facts and retreat from unfavorable ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor edged closer to trouble in his rebuttal remarks by calling a defense argument a \"diversion\" that does not \"pass the laugh test.\"   But summations in litigation often have a rough and tumble quality;  in fact, one of the defense summations here twice referred to the government's \"desperation\" to prove charges \"they can't prove.\"   We do not think that the prosecutor's remarks on this case crossed the line.   See generally United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d 436, 440-41 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1368, 128 L.Ed.2d 45 (1994).   Nor was the refusal to give the specially requested instruction reversible error;  indeed, a jury would not have made much sense of the requested language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth.  At trial Bennett and Lussier sought access to a police interview report with a government witness, Pete McFarlane, a friend of the appellants who was with them before and immediately after the attack.   The interview report, the defendants believed, might have some bearing on McFarlane's testimony that Lussier admitted in the post-attack meeting that he was holding the gun when Wing was shot.   Defendants urged that the interview report might be discoverable under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16, the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500, or Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1197, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).   The trial judge reviewed the report in camera and concluded that it was not discoverable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, all three bases for disclosure are urged.   Rule 16 does not apply since its pertinent language is directed to statements made by a defendant to a known government agent, United States v. Burns, 15 F.3d 211 (1st Cir.1994), and a statement by Lussier or any co-conspirator to McFarlane immediately after the event is not even arguably in that category.   Appellants suggest that Burns demands more of the government than the bare minimum prescribed in the rule;  but that is not what Burns says.   Compare 15 F.3d at 215-16 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Jencks Act requires inter alia production of writings that are \"substantially verbatim\" recitals of pre-trial statements made by a government witness and that relate to the subject of the witness' trial testimony.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500(e)(2).   We have reviewed the interview report at issue which contains only a few isolated direct quotations (none pertinent here) and which is neither structured nor phrased as a verbatim report.   In our view the trial court did not commit clear error in refusing to treat the six-page report as a substantially verbatim recordation of the interviewee's own words.   See United States v. Foley, 871 F.2d 235, 238-39 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lussier offers a clever gloss on the Jencks Act, urging that any simple statement in an interview report--e.g., \"Lussier held the gun\"--must because of its brevity be essentially verbatim and thus discoverable under the Act.   But this attempt to divide up the document has been rejected even in the case of isolated direct quotations, Foley, 871 F.2d at 238-39.   We note also that the report (a formal typed form) was clearly made after the interview and not during it.  United States v. Consolidated Packaging, 575 F.2d 117, 129 (7th Cir.1978) (requiring a contemporaneous recordation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Brady claim is more difficult for the government because the interview report does say that Lussier carried the gun, but attributes that information to Bennett rather than Lussier.   The report might thus appear to have some impeachment value, possibly qualifying it as Brady material under United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 677, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3381, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).   The inference is pretty limited in this case:  not only was the meeting a confusing one but the interview report does not exclude--and may even invite--the inference that Lussier acquiesced in the suggestion that he had been carrying the gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, even if we assume that the report should have been produced under Brady, the failure to do so was harmless.   At trial, both Bennett and King testified that Lussier had held the gun;  and while Bennett had a personal interest in so testifying, King did not.   Further, if McFarlane had been \"impeached\" by the report in question, the jury would have been told, once again, that Lussier had held the gun.   At the post-attack meeting, where Lussier was present, Bennett had no reason to lie and good reason not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth.   The last noteworthy issue concerns the aiding and abetting instructions. Bennett and Lussier were charged in both firearms counts--the possession and the use or carry counts--both as principals and on an aiding and abetting theory under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.   As to both gun offenses, Bennett and Lussier say that the aiding and abetting instruction permitted the jury to convict without the required scienter (for example, even if the jury believed that the assistance was unintentionally rendered).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the possession count, the jury was told that a defendant could be convicted if he \"knowingly possessed the firearm ... or aided and abetted such possession\";  parallel language was used on the companion count (\"knowingly used or carried a firearm or aided and abetted the use or carrying a firearm\").   The appellants complain that the word \"knowingly\" was not used immediately before \"aided and abetted\" in each instance;  but this is irrelevant because \"aiding and abetting\" was separately defined in the instructions, which must be read as a whole.  United States v. Fontana, 948 F.2d 796, 801 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the aiding and abetting definition itself, the district court charged in pertinent part that \"the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant associated himself with the venture, participated in it as something that he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.\"   This language obviously imports a scienter element (\"wished to bring about\";  \"sought by his actions\"), and it is the precise language approved by this court in prior cases.   E.g., United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 590-91 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But our journey is not quite over.   The Loder language, which serves reasonably well in most situations, may not perfectly cover abnormal ones.   Here, a potential ambiguity exists:  the term \"venture\" in Loder is intended as catch-all for the notion of a crime committed by another (\"the principal\") for which the government aims to hold the defendant responsible as an aider or abettor, making the defendant \"punishable as a principal.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.   See generally 1 Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions para. 11.01 (1995).   Where only a single crime is involved, confusion is unlikely under Loder's language because there is only one venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the defendants were charged in the first count with a drug possession conspiracy.   In theory the term \"venture,\" used only as part of the general definition of aiding and abetting, might lead a jury to think that the venture in question was the drug conspiracy and not the possession or use-and-carry offense.   If so, the jury might also think that it could convict the defendant who did not personally possess or use or carry a gun, so long as the aider or abettor \"wished to bring about\" the drug possession \"and sought by his actions to make [that venture] succeed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem, needless to say, is not that any element of the offense was omitted from the charge, cf. United States v. Lopez, 71 F.3d 954, 959-60 (1st Cir.1995), but that a possible ambiguity inhered in the instruction.   The defendants made several timely objections to the aiding and abetting instructions at trial, although their proposed solutions were of questionable use.   But any ambiguity in the charge was irrelevant in Lussier's case (the only evidence, obviously accepted by the jury, was that he was the principal), and it was harmless in Bennett's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the evidence, Bennett could only have been convicted as an aider and abettor.   But--as already related--Madore, who supplied the gun, testified that bringing it had been discussed in advance and that Bennett, Lussier and King all said they wanted it brought;  King, who sat next to Bennett in the car, testified that he carried the gun in his lap without concealment for at least part of the ride.   Unlike Bennett, who claimed to have had no knowledge of the gun, King and Madore were not on trial.   If there was an ambiguity in the instruction, it did not affect the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' remaining claims have been considered but do not require discussion.   In a few instances, Bennett has made claims that are not fully developed, such as his cursory attack on the intoxication instruction, or are beyond our jurisdiction (e.g., the refusal of a downward departure).   Other claims made by appellants are properly presented but seem to us hopeless on the facts (e.g., that perjured testimony was knowingly presented) or the law (the claim that section 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional).  Scarborough v. United States, 431 U.S. 563, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977) (discussed in United States v. Lopez, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case for appellants here has been well presented by counsel, and we understand the practical pressure on lawyers--especially in criminal cases--to resolve doubts in favor of including doubtful claims along with stronger ones.   But cases with difficult issues now crowd the dockets.   At least in opinion writing, the court's time is best reserved for colorable claims.   Cf. McIntosh v. Antonino, 71 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bennett moved earlier under Fed.R.App.P. 28(i) to incorporate Lussier's brief generally as to \"those facts, issues and arguments ... that may inure to [his] benefit\" and to adopt particular arguments in Lussier's brief.   The motion, previously denied subject to reconsideration, is effectively moot since none of Lussier's claims have been accepted.   But future counsel using Rule 28(i) should be aware of the need to connect the arguments adopted with the specific facts pertaining to the movant.  United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 763-64 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Bennett and Lionel Lussier were each charged with conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846;  carrying or using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1);  and unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).   The charges stemmed from a bizarre March 1994 episode in which Bennett, Lussier, and Gary King, in an attempt to avenge a previous drug-related attack and robbery against mutual friend Ronald Madore, mistakenly entered the wrong home and assaulted the occupants, ultimately shooting one of them through the finger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Madore and King were indicted for various offenses;  both pled guilty, cooperated with the prosecution, and testified against Bennett and Lussier.   After a five-day jury trial in August 1994, Bennett and Lussier were convicted on all counts and sentenced, respectively, to 360 and 378 months in prison.   In this consolidated appeal, Bennett and Lussier challenge their convictions and sentences on many grounds.   We address the more colorable of these claims, setting forth pertinent facts as necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First.   Both Bennett and Lussier challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting conviction on each count.   Neither denies participating in the assault but they dispute issues of intent and their precise role in the events.   Our familiar task on review of sufficiency is to consider the record as a whole and to determine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196263\"><a href=\"/opinion/196263/united-states-v-luciano-mosquera/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></a></span>, 1149 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conspiracy conviction can be supported by either direct or circumstantial evidence of an illegal agreement--in this case to possess marijuana with intent to distribute.   See United States v. Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 506 (1st Cir.1990).   At trial, there was testimony that on the day of the mistaken raid, Bennett, Lussier, and King, along with two other friends, drank and discussed seeking revenge for a previous attack in which mutual friend Ronald Madore, a small-time marijuana dealer, was beaten and robbed of marijuana, money, and guns.   The group continued their drinking and their discussion that evening at Madore's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Madore testified that Bennett, Lussier, and King planned to beat up the man Madore suspected was behind the previous attack, one Wayne Hathorne, take any marijuana he had (along with any money) and give the marijuana to Madore so he could sell it and share the proceeds.   King's testimony regarding the plan was less definitive;  he stated at one point that they only intended to beat Hathorne, but elsewhere that both discussed stealing Hathorne's marijuana and giving it to Madore because \"[h]e deals in it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that shortly after this conversation the four men--the appellants, Madore and King--left Madore's house in Bennett's car and drove to a trailer home, which they mistakenly believed was Hathorne's.   While Madore waited in the car, Bennett, Lussier and King entered the trailer and terrorized occupants David Wing, Michelle Morin and their children, physically assaulting Wing and Morin while a gun was held to Wing's head.   There was testimony, described later in this opinion, that all four men knew of the proposal to bring a gun and that first King and then Lussier carried the weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wing testified that during the attack all three men were shouting \"[w]here is our dope?\";  Morin heard them shouting about drugs but did not specify whether it was particular individuals or all of them.   Wing and Morin, who had no drugs, tried to convince their assailants they had the wrong house.   These pleas were met with a threat to kill Wing.   In an ensuing struggle for the gun Wing was shot through the finger.   Bennett, Lussier and King immediately fled the scene without taking anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants now insist, as they argued to the jury, that the plan was merely to beat Hathorne and did not include seizing drugs, and that much of the testimony of Madore and King was false.   But such credibility assessments are for the jury and nothing here justifies disturbing the jury's rational conclusion that Bennett and Lussier joined in a plan to, among other things, steal marijuana and give it to Madore to sell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the section 924(c)(1) charge of carrying or using a gun during a drug crime, Lussier concedes the sufficiency of the evidence against him, while Bennett maintains that nothing showed that he had carried or used a gun in relation to the marijuana conspiracy.   But Bennett was also charged with aiding and abetting the carry or use offense.   Thus, his conviction can be sustained under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 if Bennett knew a firearm would be carried or used by a co-conspirator in the drug trafficking offense and willingly took some action to facilitate the carriage or use.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196263\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Luciano-Mosquera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/196263/united-states-v-luciano-mosquera/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial there was testimony that the gun used in the attack was taken from a couch in Madore's house under circumstances where Bennett could have seen it.   Madore testified that he told the other three they did not need a gun, but each said he would rather take it.   King held the gun on the ride to Wing's home while sitting in the passenger seat beside driver Bennett;  King said that he did not conceal the gun in the car, although he conceded he may at some point have placed it in his waistband.   It was his impression the others were aware he had the gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this evidence a jury could find that Bennett knew that one of his companions was carrying the gun when they committed the attack, and facilitation is essentially undisputed since Bennett provided his car to transport himself, his co-conspirators, and the gun to execute the raid.   In Luciano Mosquera, we upheld an abetting conviction because the defendant provided a house for meeting where guns were displayed and discussed, and later used during drug trafficking <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196263\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">crime.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/196263/united-states-v-luciano-mosquera/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span>.   In sum, once knowledge on the part of the aider and abettor is established, it does not take much to satisfy the facilitation element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to adequacy of evidence on the felon-in-possession charge, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), Bennett and Lussier make only the narrow claim that the evidence failed to establish that the gun had travelled in interstate commerce, the jurisdictional element of that offense.   The gun was not introduced into evidence since it had been discarded by King and Madore.   But from direct testimony the jury was entitled to find that it was a .22 caliber \"Single-Six\" made by Sturm Ruger and that Sturm Ruger was an out-of-state manufacturer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the gun could have been a replica fashioned by an in-state gunsmith.   This remote possibility had only the most tenuous evidentiary support, namely, a witness or two said such a gun could be fabricated but at significant cost.   The overwhelming probability was that the gun was authentic and had been transported--at some time--in interstate commerce.   Certainly the jury's conclusion that the gun was genuine and had previously traveled in commerce was not irrational.   Cf. United States v. Kirvan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610801\"><a href=\"/opinion/610801/united-states-v-paul-j-kirvan-united-states-v-paul-j-kirvan/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span>, 966-67 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second.   Shortly into its deliberations, the jury requested the testimony of victims Wing and Morin.   The trial judge conferred with counsel and then instructed the jury to use their recollections, adding that he would provide the requested testimony if the jury still found it necessary.   After further deliberations the jury asked for only the direct testimony of Wing and Morin.   Over defense objections, the judge then had the direct testimony of Wing and Morin read back to the jury.   Immediately after the read-back, the judge asked jurors as a group whether they would also like to hear the cross or other testimony of the two witnesses;  none did.   Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, which was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants concede that it would have been within the trial judge's discretion to have read to the jury all of Wing and Morin's testimony;  but they say that providing only the direct examination was prejudicial--indeed, unconstitutional--because the unread cross-examination responses of both witnesses were at \"striking variance\" with their testimony on direct.   No examples of such variances are mentioned.   No case law is provided to suggest that the jury may not select what it wishes to hear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge's decision whether or not to grant a request to read back testimony requested by a jury is reviewed for abuse of discretion, United States v. Akitoye, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554021\"><a href=\"/opinion/554021/united-states-v-adegboyega-akitoye/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 226 (1st Cir.1991);  and we think that this is equally true of the judge's decision whether the jury should be made to hear additional, related testimony that the jury made clear it did not need to rehear.   Of course, such discretion is not unlimited.   And certainly the trial judge should exercise great care when the testimony the defense counsel wants the jury to hear is the cross-examination of the very witnesses whose full direct testimony has just been reread.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But no inflexible rule exists that the cross must always be read.  United States v. Wright-Barker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465059\"><a href=\"/opinion/465059/united-states-v-alfredo-wright-barker-in-84-5845-appeal-of-holger/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 174 (3d Cir.1986).   In plenty of cases, the direct testimony of another witness might be far more relevant in assessing the testimony of the witness whose testimony the jury requested.   Each case must be decided on its facts, and it is the appellant's burden to show that the trial judge acted unreasonably.   Here on appeal, with ample leisure to compare the direct and cross of Wing and Morin, appellate counsel has still made no specific showing as to why it was unfair in this case for the district court to omit cross-examination that the jury did not want.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is a criminal case, we have read the direct and cross-examination of the two witnesses in order to assure ourselves that the district court's action did not cause any miscarriage of justice.   We have found nothing to suggest that the cross-examination was vital or contained more than the customary measure of minor variations or inconsistencies.   Prior to requesting the read-backs, the jury could quite reasonably have concluded that it credited these witnesses' direct testimony--they had no reason to lie--and then sought the read-back to refresh the jury's own recollection on some specific points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no merit in two other related claims of error.   Appellants now say that the jury was confused or bewildered by the trial judge's offer to have the cross reread;  but the trial judge found otherwise.   We have read the colloquy and find no reason to doubt the trial judge's conclusion.   Appellants also say that the jury should have been cautioned not to give the direct testimony special weight, e.g., United States v. DeSoto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529340\"><a href=\"/opinion/529340/united-states-v-maria-urrego-de-soto-gustavo-chaverra-cardona-and-ruth/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 363 (7th Cir.1989), but no such request was made at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third.   In closing, the prosecutor referred several times, without objection, to the \"selective focus\" of the defense.   In rebuttal, the prosecutor described a defense argument as a \"diversion\" that \"doesn't pass the laugh test\" and again referred to the defense's \"selective focus.\"   Defense counsel immediately objected to the \"diversion\" remark.   After the summations, defense counsel requested a curative instruction that the jury disregard these remarks to the extent that they \"degraded legitimate defenses.\"   The judge found the comments unobjectionable and gave only the standard instruction that arguments of counsel are not evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants now maintain that both of the prosecutor's remarks improperly denigrated defense counsel as well as the defense strategy.   The prosecutor is expected to refrain from impugning, directly or through implication, the integrity or institutional role of defense counsel.  United States v. Boldt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558024\"><a href=\"/opinion/558024/united-states-v-david-w-boldt/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1991).   But \"selective focus\" remarks were part of a larger metaphor used by the prosecutor in urging the jury to \"act as a camera\" and keep \"focused\" on the evidence.   In context, the remarks merely echo the truism that lawyers highlight helpful facts and retreat from unfavorable ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor edged closer to trouble in his rebuttal remarks by calling a defense argument a \"diversion\" that does not \"pass the laugh test.\"   But summations in litigation often have a rough and tumble quality;  in fact, one of the defense summations here twice referred to the government's \"desperation\" to prove charges \"they can't prove.\"   We do not think that the prosecutor's remarks on this case crossed the line.   See generally United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609732\"><a href=\"/opinion/609732/united-states-v-luis-e-ortiz-arrigoitia-aka-colibri-united-states-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 440-41 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span> </span>(1994).   Nor was the refusal to give the specially requested instruction reversible error;  indeed, a jury would not have made much sense of the requested language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth.  At trial Bennett and Lussier sought access to a police interview report with a government witness, Pete McFarlane, a friend of the appellants who was with them before and immediately after the attack.   The interview report, the defendants believed, might have some bearing on McFarlane's testimony that Lussier admitted in the post-attack meeting that he was holding the gun when Wing was shot.   Defendants urged that the interview report might be discoverable under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16, the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500, or Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The trial judge reviewed the report in camera and concluded that it was not discoverable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, all three bases for disclosure are urged.   Rule 16 does not apply since its pertinent language is directed to statements made by a defendant to a known government agent, United States v. Burns, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195186\"><a href=\"/opinion/195186/united-states-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1994), and a statement by Lussier or any co-conspirator to McFarlane immediately after the event is not even arguably in that category.   Appellants suggest that Burns demands more of the government than the bare minimum prescribed in the rule;  but that is not what Burns says.   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195186\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Compare</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195186/united-states-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">215-16</span> </a></span>n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Jencks Act requires inter alia production of writings that are \"substantially verbatim\" recitals of pre-trial statements made by a government witness and that relate to the subject of the witness' trial testimony.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500(e)(2).   We have reviewed the interview report at issue which contains only a few isolated direct quotations (none pertinent here) and which is neither structured nor phrased as a verbatim report.   In our view the trial court did not commit clear error in refusing to treat the six-page report as a substantially verbatim recordation of the interviewee's own words.   See United States v. Foley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520583\"><a href=\"/opinion/520583/united-states-v-richard-e-foley/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, 238-39 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lussier offers a clever gloss on the Jencks Act, urging that any simple statement in an interview report--e.g., \"Lussier held the gun\"--must because of its brevity be essentially verbatim and thus discoverable under the Act.   But this attempt to divide up the document has been rejected even in the case of isolated direct quotations, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520583\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Foley,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/520583/united-states-v-richard-e-foley/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">238-39</span></a></span>.   We note also that the report (a formal typed form) was clearly made after the interview and not during it.  United States v. Consolidated Packaging, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355426\"><a href=\"/opinion/355426/united-states-v-consolidated-packaging-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 129 (7th Cir.1978) (requiring a contemporaneous recordation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Brady claim is more difficult for the government because the interview report does say that Lussier carried the gun, but attributes that information to Bennett rather than Lussier.   The report might thus appear to have some impeachment value, possibly qualifying it as Brady material under United States v. Bagley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 677, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3375</span></a></span>, 3381, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span> </a></span>(1985).   The inference is pretty limited in this case:  not only was the meeting a confusing one but the interview report does not exclude--and may even invite--the inference that Lussier acquiesced in the suggestion that he had been carrying the gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, even if we assume that the report should have been produced under Brady, the failure to do so was harmless.   At trial, both Bennett and King testified that Lussier had held the gun;  and while Bennett had a personal interest in so testifying, King did not.   Further, if McFarlane had been \"impeached\" by the report in question, the jury would have been told, once again, that Lussier had held the gun.   At the post-attack meeting, where Lussier was present, Bennett had no reason to lie and good reason not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth.   The last noteworthy issue concerns the aiding and abetting instructions. Bennett and Lussier were charged in both firearms counts--the possession and the use or carry counts--both as principals and on an aiding and abetting theory under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.   As to both gun offenses, Bennett and Lussier say that the aiding and abetting instruction permitted the jury to convict without the required scienter (for example, even if the jury believed that the assistance was unintentionally rendered).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the possession count, the jury was told that a defendant could be convicted if he \"knowingly possessed the firearm ... or aided and abetted such possession\";  parallel language was used on the companion count (\"knowingly used or carried a firearm or aided and abetted the use or carrying a firearm\").   The appellants complain that the word \"knowingly\" was not used immediately before \"aided and abetted\" in each instance;  but this is irrelevant because \"aiding and abetting\" was separately defined in the instructions, which must be read as a whole.  United States v. Fontana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571447\"><a href=\"/opinion/571447/united-states-v-n-john-fontana-ii/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span>, 801 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the aiding and abetting definition itself, the district court charged in pertinent part that \"the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant associated himself with the venture, participated in it as something that he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.\"   This language obviously imports a scienter element (\"wished to bring about\";  \"sought by his actions\"), and it is the precise language approved by this court in prior cases.   E.g., United States v. Loder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195365\"><a href=\"/opinion/195365/united-states-v-loder/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 590-91 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But our journey is not quite over.   The Loder language, which serves reasonably well in most situations, may not perfectly cover abnormal ones.   Here, a potential ambiguity exists:  the term \"venture\" in Loder is intended as catch-all for the notion of a crime committed by another (\"the principal\") for which the government aims to hold the defendant responsible as an aider or abettor, making the defendant \"punishable as a principal.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.   See generally 1 Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions para. 11.01 (1995).   Where only a single crime is involved, confusion is unlikely under Loder's language because there is only one venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the defendants were charged in the first count with a drug possession conspiracy.   In theory the term \"venture,\" used only as part of the general definition of aiding and abetting, might lead a jury to think that the venture in question was the drug conspiracy and not the possession or use-and-carry offense.   If so, the jury might also think that it could convict the defendant who did not personally possess or use or carry a gun, so long as the aider or abettor \"wished to bring about\" the drug possession \"and sought by his actions to make [that venture] succeed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem, needless to say, is not that any element of the offense was omitted from the charge, cf. United States v. Lopez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196473\"><a href=\"/opinion/196473/united-states-v-delano-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>, 959-60 (1st Cir.1995), but that a possible ambiguity inhered in the instruction.   The defendants made several timely objections to the aiding and abetting instructions at trial, although their proposed solutions were of questionable use.   But any ambiguity in the charge was irrelevant in Lussier's case (the only evidence, obviously accepted by the jury, was that he was the principal), and it was harmless in Bennett's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the evidence, Bennett could only have been convicted as an aider and abettor.   But--as already related--Madore, who supplied the gun, testified that bringing it had been discussed in advance and that Bennett, Lussier and King all said they wanted it brought;  King, who sat next to Bennett in the car, testified that he carried the gun in his lap without concealment for at least part of the ride.   Unlike Bennett, who claimed to have had no knowledge of the gun, King and Madore were not on trial.   If there was an ambiguity in the instruction, it did not affect the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' remaining claims have been considered but do not require discussion.   In a few instances, Bennett has made claims that are not fully developed, such as his cursory attack on the intoxication instruction, or are beyond our jurisdiction (e.g., the refusal of a downward departure).   Other claims made by appellants are properly presented but seem to us hopeless on the facts (e.g., that perjured testimony was knowingly presented) or the law (the claim that section 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional).  Scarborough v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109672\"><a href=\"/opinion/109672/scarborough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109672\"><a href=\"/opinion/109672/scarborough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span> </a></span>(1977) (discussed in United States v.

But cases with difficult issues now crowd the dockets.   At least in opinion writing, the court's time is best reserved for colorable claims.   Cf. McIntosh v. Antonino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196445\"><a href=\"/opinion/196445/mcintosh-v-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Bennett moved earlier under Fed.R.App.P. 28(i) to incorporate Lussier's brief generally as to \"those facts, issues and arguments ... that may inure to [his] benefit\" and to adopt particular arguments in Lussier's brief.   The motion, previously denied subject to reconsideration, is effectively moot since none of Lussier's claims have been accepted.   But future counsel using Rule 28(i) should be aware of the need to connect the arguments adopted with the specific facts pertaining to the movant.  United States v.
