For the reasons limned herein, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's order.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Defendant-appellant Gerald Connell pleaded guilty to an\n\ninformation that  charged him with structuring  cash transactions\n\nto  avoid certain reporting requirements.  See 31 U.S.C.    5313,\n                                              \n\n5324 (1988).   At a sentencing hearing held on June 26, 1991, the\n\ndistrict  court imposed  a prison  sentence (thirty  months) that\n\nfell  within  the  guideline  sentencing  range  (GSR),  fixed  a\n\nsupervised release  period, fined  Connell $15,000, and  directed\n\nhim to pay the  costs of his forthcoming confinement  at the rate\n\nof $1,415.56 per month.\n\n          Connell  appealed, complaining  that his  offense level\n\nhad been improperly  constituted, thereby inflating the  GSR.  We\n\naffirmed the sentence, see United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191\n                                                   \n\n(1st Cir. 1992), but with the proviso that the district court, on\n\nremand, nevertheless might consider whether an intervening change\n\nin  the   sentencing  guidelines  warranted  adjustment   of  the\n\nsentence.  See id. at 199.1\n                  \n\n                    \n\n     1The  revision  to the  guidelines  involved  the number  of\nlevels that should be  added to a defendant's base  offense level\nin a case where, as here, criminally derived funds were knowingly\nlaundered.   The extent, timing,  and effect of  the revision are\nexplained in our earlier  opinion, see Connell, 960 F.2d  at 197,\n                                              \n\n                                2\n\n          After  the   case  returned  to  the   district  court,\n\ndefendant sought an  adjustment of sentence based  on the changed\n\nguideline and also moved for reconsideration of the $15,000 fine.\n\nThe court heard oral argument on May 7, 1992.  It issued an order\n\non  that  date  recomputing the  GSR  in  line  with the  revised\n\nguideline  and  reducing Connell's  prison  term to  twenty-seven\n\nmonths,  but leaving  the fine  intact.   The cost-of-confinement\n\nportion  of  the  sentence remained  unchallenged  and  unchanged\n\n(except  that the court's estimate of overall cost was lowered to\n\nreflect  the three-month decrease in the term of immurement).  An\n\namended judgment was entered  on or about May 28, 1992.   Connell\n\nappealed from the order  and judgment, but let the  appeal slide.\n\nThe amended judgment thus became final.\n\n          Some  seven months  later, Connell  shifted gears.   He\n\nretained   new   counsel  and   filed   a   further  motion   for\n\nreconsideration of sentence  in which  he raised,  for the  first\n\ntime,  a complaint  about  the cost-of-confinement  order.2   The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion.3  This appeal followed.\n\n                    \n\nand we will not rehearse those details here.\n\n     2Connell filed this motion in the district court on November\n24, 1992, and filed an amended  motion on December 23, 1992.  For\nease in reference, we  treat these pleadings as a  single motion,\nsometimes styled the \"December 1992 motion for reconsideration.\"\n\n     3Although  the  government  has  not raised  the  point,  we\nquestion  whether the  district court, so  long after  the appeal\nperiod expired, had  jurisdiction to  entertain Connell's  motion\nfor reconsideration.  See United States v. Miller, 869 F.2d 1418,\n                                                 \n1421  (10th  Cir. 1989)  (ruling that  the district  court lacked\njurisdiction to  entertain a motion  to reconsider in  a criminal\ncase where defendant filed the motion twenty-one months after the\ndate on which the appeal period  [10 days] began to run);  United\n                                                                 \n\n                                3\n\nII.  DISCUSSION\n\n          Connell appeals the denial  of his December 1992 motion\n\nfor reconsideration,  sounding two variations on  a single theme:\n\nthat U.S.S.G.   5E1.2(i), which provides  for cost-of-confinement\n\norders  in  certain  criminal  cases,4  is  unconstitutional  or,\n\nalternatively,  is  in  excess  of  the  Sentencing  Commission's\n\nstatutory  powers.     Although  the  challenge   itself  is  not\n\nfrivolous, compare, e.g., United  States v. Spiropoulos, 976 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n155, 165-69 (3d  Cir. 1992)  (striking down the  imposition of  a\n\ncost-of-confinement order on similar grounds)  with, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Turner,     F.2d    ,     (7th Cir. 1993) [No. 93-1148,\n                \n\n                    \n\nStates v.  Cook, 670  F.2d 46,  48 (5th Cir.)  (holding that  the\n               \ndistrict  court lacked  jurisdiction  to entertain  a motion  for\nrehearing  filed  fifty-seven  days  after  the  entry  of  final\njudgment  in a criminal case), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 982 (1982).\n                                           \nWe  need not probe the point, however,  for it is settled that an\nappellate  court may  forego the  resolution of  a jurisdictional\nquestion if, as  is true  here, the appeal  is uncomplicated  and\neasily  resolved in  favor  of the  party  to whose  benefit  the\njurisdictional question  would redound.   See Norton  v. Mathews,\n                                                                \n427 U.S.  524, 532 (1976);  Secretary of the Navy  v.

United  States  v.\n                                                             \nLeavitt, 925  F.2d 516, 517 (1st Cir. 1991) (stating that a court\n       \nmay  overlook waiver of an issue by  a criminal defendant so long\nas resolution on the merits will favor the same party  as would a\ndisposition premised on waiver).\n\n     4The guideline provides in pertinent part: \n\n          Notwithstanding the  provisions of subsection\n          (c)  [the fine  table] of  this section,  but\n          subject to  the provisions of  subsection (f)\n          [discussing the defendant's ability to  pay] \n          . . . , the court shall impose an  additional\n          fine amount that  is at  least sufficient  to\n          pay  the  costs  to  the  government  of  any\n          imprisonment,   probation,   or    supervised\n          release ordered.\n\nU.S.S.G.   5E1.2(i).\n\n                                4\n\n1993  U.S. App.  LEXIS  17472  at  *3-*7] (upholding  a  cost-of-\n\nconfinement order against a  similar challenge) and United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Hagmann,  950 F.2d  175, 187  (5th  Cir. 1991)  (same), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied,  113 S.  Ct.  108  (1992);  see  also  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nCarrozza,      F.2d    ,      (1st Cir. 1993)  [No. 92-1798, slip\n        \n\nop.  at  34-37]  (leaving  question  open),  Connell  has  failed\n\nproperly to preserve it in the circumstances of this case.\n\n          This  case is  analogous in  factual profile  and legal\n\nstance to United  States v. Bell,  988 F.2d 247  (1st Cir.  1993)\n                                \n\n(Bell II).  Bell  originally challenged his sentence as  a career\n        \n\noffender under  the  sentencing guidelines,  contending that  the\n\noffense of conviction   being a felon in possession of a  firearm\n\n  was not a crime of violence.  See id. at  249; United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBell, 966 F.2d 703, 704 (1st Cir. 1992) (Bell I).  Bell contended\n                                               \n\nthat he should have been sentenced instead under the Armed Career\n\nCriminal Act (ACCA), 18  U.S.C.   924(e)(1)(1988).  See  Bell II,\n                                                                \n\n988 F.2d at 249;  Bell I, 966 F.2d  at 704.  We  sustained Bell's\n                        \n\nappeal, holding  \"that, where  the offense  of conviction  is the\n\noffense of being  a convicted  felon in knowing  possession of  a\n\nfirearm,  the conviction  is not  for a  `crime of  violence' and\n\nthat,  therefore, the  career offender  provision of  the federal\n\nsentencing guidelines does not apply.\"  Bell  I, 966 F.2d at 703.\n                                               \n\nHence, we  vacated Bell's sentence and  remanded for resentencing\n\nin light of our opinion.  See id. at 707.\n                                 \n\n          At the  resumed sentencing hearing, Bell  for the first\n\ntime  sought to challenge  the validity of  his prior convictions\n\n                                5\n\nand,  through that medium, his  ACCA status.   The district court\n\nruled  that the objection was  untimely and sentenced  Bell as an\n\narmed career  criminal.   See Bell  II, 988 F.2d  at 249-50.   We\n                                      \n\naffirmed the district court's decision to deny reconsideration of\n\nthe second, delinquent, challenge.  See id. at 252.\n                                           \n\n          The  lesson  of the  Bell cases  is  as clear  as their\n                                   \n\nnamesake:\n\n          [A]  legal decision  made at  one stage  of a\n          civil  or  criminal case,  unchallenged  in a\n          subsequent  appeal  despite the  existence of\n          ample opportunity to  do so, becomes  the law\n          of  the case  for future  stages of  the same\n          litigation, and the aggrieved party is deemed\n          to have forfeited any right to challenge that\n          particular decision at a subsequent date.\n\nId.  at  250.   This  lesson  embodies  a rather  straightforward\n   \n\napplication of  the law of the case doctrine     a  doctrine that\n\nis rooted  in an array of prudential  considerations:  \"stability\n\nin the decisionmaking process, predictability of results,  proper\n\nworking relationships  between trial  and  appellate courts,  and\n\njudicial economy.\"   United  States v. Rivera-Martinez,  931 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n148, 151 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 112 S. Ct. 184 (1991).   That\n                                  \n\nis to  say, law-of-the-case rules  afford courts the  security of\n\nconsistency  within a single case while at the same time avoiding\n\nthe  wastefulness, delay, and  overall wheel-spinning that attend\n\npiecemeal  consideration   of  matters  which   might  have  been\n\npreviously adjudicated.  See 18 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal\n                                                                 \n\nPractice  &amp;  Procedure    4478  at  603  (Supp.  1993).   In  the\n                      \n\ninterests of  both consistency  and judicial  economy, therefore,\n\nlitigants  should not ordinarily be  allowed to take serial bites\n\n                                6\n\nat the appellate  apple.  See, e.g., United  States v. Rosen, 929\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 839, 842 n.5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S.

Murtha,  377 F.2d  428, 431 (5th  Cir. 1967);  see also\n                                                                 \n\nWilliamsburg Wax Museum, Inc. v.

Cir. 1987) (stating that a legal  decision made at\n\none  stage  of  litigation  becomes  the  law  of  the  case  for\n\nsubsequent   stages  of   litigation  if   the  opportunity   for\n\nchallenging the  decision in an  earlier appeal existed  and went\n\nunexploited).\n\n          We think it follows that when a trial court, on remand,\n\nseeks  to dispose  of  a case  in  accordance with  an  appellate\n\ncourt's  mandate,  it \"must  implement  both the  letter  and the\n\nspirit of the mandate, taking into account  the appellate court's\n\nopinion  and the  circumstances it  embraces.\"  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nKikumura, 947 F.2d 72,  76 (3d Cir. 1991) (citation  and internal\n        \n\nquotation  marks  omitted).   Because  the  mandate  serves as  a\n\nlimitation  on  the power  of the  trial  court, the  issues that\n\nremain  open on  remand frequently will  be circumscribed  by the\n\nearlier appeal  and by the  appellate court's disposition  of the\n\nissues therein.  See Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at  150-51; United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Cornelius, 968 F.2d 703, 705 (8th Cir. 1992).\n                   \n\n          The  case before  us is  governed by  these rules.   In\n\n1991,  the  district  court   invoked  U.S.S.G.     5E1.2(i)  and\n\nsentenced  Connell,  inter  alia,   to  pay  the  costs   of  his\n                                \n\nconfinement.   Connell  appealed his  sentence, but  eschewed any\n\n                                7\n\nchallenge to the cost-of-confinement order.  Having foregone that\n\nopportunity,  Connell  could  not   thereafter  insist  that  the\n\ndistrict court exceed the limited scope of our remand in order to\n\nrevisit a settled issue.\n\n          In this case, moreover, Connell defaulted not once, but\n\ntwice.   As we have indicated,  he did not challenge the cost-of-\n\nconfinement order on his  direct appeal.  He then  compounded his\n\ndifficulties  by  omitting any  reference  to  the  order in  the\n\nproceedings   that  immediately   followed  our   remand.     His\n\nafterthought request for  reconsideration, occurring, as it  did,\n\nsome  seven months  after the  district court  had fulfilled  its\n\nmission on remand   and well beyond the expiration of the  appeal\n\nperiod in respect to the revised sentence   came too  late.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  United States v.

After all, if Connell,\n                   \n\nhaving  initially conceded  the cost-of-confinement  issue, could\n\nnot  have raised it when the district court, on remand, undertook\n\nits  reconsideration  of  the  incarcera-  tive  portion  of  his\n\nsentence, see  Bell II, 988 F.2d  at 250, then he  clearly had no\n                      \n\nright  to raise the issue  after the revised  sentence had become\n\nfinal.   Cf., e.g., Witty v. Dukakis,     F.2d    ,     (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n                                8\n\n1993) [No. 93-1238, slip op. at 7] (\"A party confronted  by a set\n\nperiod for taking an  action cannot allow the  time to lapse  and\n\nthen  resurrect  his  rights  merely  by  asking  the   court  to\n\nreconsider or to confirm what the court has already done.\").\n\n          To  be sure, neither the  law of the  case doctrine nor\n\nits kissing  cousin, the so-called \"mandate rule,\" is designed to\n\nfunction as a straitjacket.  Rather, these are discretion-guiding\n\nprinciples,  generally thought to be subject to exceptions in the\n\ninterests of justice.5  See Bell II, 988 F.2d at  251 (collecting\n                                   \n\ncases).   But, the exceptions are narrowly  configured and seldom\n\ninvoked, and this  case has none of  the requisite earmarks:   no\n\nnew  evidence has  been unearthed,  no controlling  precedent has\n\nemerged suddenly,  the motion  for  reconsideration contained  no\n\nsuggestion that  Connell  lacks the  means  to pay  the  cost-of-\n\ncommitment impost,  the delay in  raising the point  is unexcused\n\nand seems  excessive, and,  most importantly, we  are unpersuaded\n\nthat the  \"decision  was  clearly  erroneous  and  would  work  a\n\nmanifest injustice.\"  Rivera- Martinez,  931 F.2d at 151 (quoting\n                                      \n\nWhite,  377 F.2d at 432).  Given these circumstances, and mindful\n     \n\nof the  substantial latitude  retained by  the district  court in\n\ndeciding  whether to rethink matters previously  set to rest, see\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v.

CONCLUSION\n\n          We need  go  no further.6    Courts can  only  function\n\nunder the aegis of rules   and parties who ignore the rules do so\n\nat  their peril.  See, e.g., Puleio  v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1203\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (\"The law ministers to  the vigilant not to those\n\nwho sleep upon perceptible rights.\"), cert. denied, 485  U.S. 990\n                                                  \n\n(1988).  So it  is here:  appellant,  having failed to  challenge\n\nthe cost-of-confinement order in a timeous manner,  must bear the\n\npredictable  consequences of his neglect.   On the  facts of this\n\ncase, we discern no  injustice in holding appellant to  the usual\n\nraise-or-waive standard.\n\nAffirmed.\n         \n\n                    \n\n     6Citing  a  November 1992  amendment  to  U.S.S.G.    3E1.1,\nConnell's December 1992 motion for reconsideration also  asserted\nan  entitlement to a  more extravagant  credit for  acceptance of\nresponsibility.  The  district court hewed  to the original  two-\nlevel decrease  for acceptance  of responsibility because  it did\nnot   believe  that   the   1992  amendment   could  be   applied\nretroactively.  This court  later reached the same  conclusion in\nan unrelated  case.  See United States  v. Desouza, 995 F.2d 323,\n                                                  \n324  (1st  Cir.  1993)  (per  curiam).

For the reasons limned herein, we affirm the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant Gerald Connell pleaded guilty to an information that charged him with structuring cash transactions to avoid certain reporting requirements.  See 31 U.S.C. Secs. 5313, 5324 (1988).  At a sentencing hearing held on June 26, 1991, the district court imposed a prison sentence (thirty months) that fell within the guideline sentencing range (GSR), fixed a supervised release period, fined Connell $15,000, and directed him to pay the costs of his forthcoming confinement at the rate of $1,415.56 per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connell appealed, complaining that his offense level had been improperly constituted, thereby inflating the GSR.  We affirmed the sentence, seeUnited States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191 (1st Cir.1992), but with the proviso that the district court, on remand, nevertheless might consider whether an intervening change in the sentencing guidelines warranted adjustment of the sentence.  Seeid. at 199.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the case returned to the district court, defendant sought an adjustment of sentence based on the changed guideline and also moved for reconsideration of the $15,000 fine.  The court heard oral argument on May 7, 1992.  It issued an order on that date recomputing the GSR in line with the revised guideline and reducing Connell's prison term to twenty-seven months, but leaving the fine intact.  The cost-of-confinement portion of the sentence remained unchallenged and unchanged (except that the court's estimate of overall cost was lowered to reflect the three-month decrease in the term of immurement).  An amended judgment was entered on or about May 28, 1992.  Connell appealed from the order and judgment, but let the appeal slide.  The amended judgment thus became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some seven months later, Connell shifted gears.  He retained new counsel and filed a further motion for reconsideration of sentence in which he raised, for the first time, a complaint about the cost-of-confinement order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court denied the motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connell appeals the denial of his December 1992 motion for reconsideration, sounding two variations on a single theme:  that U.S.S.G. Sec. 5E1.2(i), which provides for cost-of-confinement orders in certain criminal cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> is unconstitutional or, alternatively, is in excess of the Sentencing Commission's statutory powers.  Although the challenge itself is not frivolous, compare, e.g.,United States v. Spiropoulos, 976 F.2d 155, 165-69 (3d Cir.1992) (striking down the imposition of a cost-of-confinement order on similar grounds) with, e.g.,United States v. Turner, 998 F.2d 534, 536-538 (7th Cir.1993) (upholding a cost-of-confinement order against a similar challenge) andUnited States v. Hagmann, 950 F.2d 175, 187 (5th Cir.1991) (same), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 108, 121 L.Ed.2d 66 (1992);  see alsoUnited States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 83 (1st Cir.1993) (leaving question open), Connell has failed properly to preserve it in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is analogous in factual profile and legal stance to United States v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247 (1st Cir.1993) (Bell II ).   Bell originally challenged his sentence as a career offender under the sentencing guidelines, contending that the offense of convictionbeing a felon in possession of a firearm--was not a crime of violence.  Seeid. at 249;  United States v. Bell, 966 F.2d 703, 704 (1st Cir.1992) (Bell I ).   Bell contended that he should have been sentenced instead under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1) (1988).  SeeBell II, 988 F.2d at 249;  Bell I, 966 F.2d at 704.   We sustained Bell's appeal, holding \"that, where the offense of conviction is the offense of being a convicted felon in knowing possession of a firearm, the conviction is not for a 'crime of violence' and that, therefore, the career offender provision of the federal sentencing guidelines does not apply.\"  Bell I, 966 F.2d at 703.   Hence, we vacated Bell's sentence and remanded for resentencing in light of our opinion.  Seeid. at 707.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the resumed sentencing hearing, Bell for the first time sought to challenge the validity of his prior convictions and, through that medium, his ACCA status.  The district court ruled that the objection was untimely and sentenced Bell as an armed career criminal.  SeeBell II, 988 F.2d at 249-50.   We affirmed the district court's decision to deny reconsideration of the second, delinquent, challenge.  Seeid. at 252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lesson of the Bell cases is as clear as their namesake:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[A] legal decision made at one stage of a civil or criminal case, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal despite the existence of ample opportunity to do so, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and the aggrieved party is deemed to have forfeited any right to challenge that particular decision at a subsequent date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 250.   This lesson embodies a rather straightforward application of the law of the case doctrine--a doctrine that is rooted in an array of prudential considerations:  \"stability in the decisionmaking process, predictability of results, proper working relationships between trial and appellate courts, and judicial economy.\"  United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 151 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 184, 116 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991).  That is to say, law-of-the-case rules afford courts the security of consistency within a single case while at the same time avoiding the wastefulness, delay, and overall wheel-spinning that attend piecemeal consideration of matters which might have been previously adjudicated.  See 18 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Sec. 4478 at 603 (Supp.1993).  In the interests of both consistency and judicial economy, therefore, litigants should not ordinarily be allowed to take serial bites at the appellate apple.  See, e.g.,United States v. Rosen, 929 F.2d 839, 842 n. 5 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 77, 116 L.Ed.2d 51 (1991);  United States v. DeJesus, 752 F.2d 640, 642-43 (1st Cir.1985);  White v. Murtha, 377 F.2d 428, 431 (5th Cir.1967);  see alsoWilliamsburg Wax Museum, Inc. v. Historic Figures, Inc., 810 F.2d 243, 250 (D.C.Cir.1987) (stating that a legal decision made at one stage of litigation becomes the law of the case for subsequent stages of litigation if the opportunity for challenging the decision in an earlier appeal existed and went unexploited).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it follows that when a trial court, on remand, seeks to dispose of a case in accordance with an appellate court's mandate, it \"must implement both the letter and the spirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate court's opinion and the circumstances it embraces.\"  United States v. Kikumura, 947 F.2d 72, 76 (3d Cir.1991) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the mandate serves as a limitation on the power of the trial court, the issues that remain open on remand frequently will be circumscribed by the earlier appeal and by the appellate court's disposition of the issues therein.  SeeRivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 150-51;  United States v. Cornelius, 968 F.2d 703, 705 (8th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case before us is governed by these rules.  In 1991, the district court invoked U.S.S.G. Sec. 5E1.2(i) and sentenced Connell, inter alia, to pay the costs of his confinement.  Connell appealed his sentence, but eschewed any challenge to the cost-of-confinement order.  Having foregone that opportunity, Connell could not thereafter insist that the district court exceed the limited scope of our remand in order to revisit a settled issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, moreover, Connell defaulted not once, but twice.  As we have indicated, he did not challenge the cost-of-confinement order on his direct appeal.  He then compounded his difficulties by omitting any reference to the order in the proceedings that immediately followed our remand.  His afterthought request for reconsideration, occurring, as it did, some seven months after the district court had fulfilled its mission on remand--and well beyond the expiration of the appeal period in respect to the revised sentence--came too late.  See, e.g.,United States v. Ramirez, 954 F.2d 1035, 1038 (5th Cir.)  (holding that, in order to be timely, a criminal defendant's motion for reconsideration must be filed within the ten-day time period allotted for appeal), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 3010, 120 L.Ed.2d 884 (1992);  see alsoUnited States v. Miller, 869 F.2d 1418, 1421 (10th Cir.1989);  United States v. Cook, 670 F.2d 46, 48 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 982, 102 S.Ct. 2255, 72 L.Ed.2d 860 (1982).  After all, if Connell, having initially conceded the cost-of-confinement issue, could not have raised it when the district court, on remand, undertook its reconsideration of the incarcerative portion of his sentence, seeBell II, 988 F.2d at 250, then he clearly had no right to raise the issue after the revised sentence had become final.  Cf., e.g.,Witty v. Dukakis, 3 F.3d 517, 520 (1st Cir.1993) (\"A party confronted by a set period for taking an action cannot allow the time to lapse and then resurrect his rights merely by asking the court to reconsider or to confirm what the court has already done.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, neither the law of the case doctrine nor its kissing cousin, the so-called \"mandate rule,\" is designed to function as a straitjacket.  Rather, these are discretion-guiding principles, generally thought to be subject to exceptions in the interests of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  SeeBell II, 988 F.2d at 251 (collecting cases).  But, the exceptions are narrowly configured and seldom invoked, and this case has none of the requisite earmarks:  no new evidence has been unearthed, no controlling precedent has emerged suddenly, the motion for reconsideration contained no suggestion that Connell lacks the means to pay the cost-of-commitment impost, the delay in raising the point is unexcused and seems excessive, and, most importantly, we are unpersuaded that the \"decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\"  Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 151 (quoting White, 377 F.2d at 432).   Given these circumstances, and mindful of the substantial latitude retained by the district court in deciding whether to rethink matters previously set to rest, seeUnited States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 20-21 (1st Cir.1992), we cannot say that the court below abused its discretion in denying Connell's belated motion for reconsideration of this aspect of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Courts can only function under the aegis of rules--and parties who ignore the rules do so at their peril.  See, e.g.,Puleio v.

So it is here:  appellant, having failed to challenge the cost-of-confinement order in a timeous manner, must bear the predictable consequences of his neglect.  On the facts of this case, we discern no injustice in holding appellant to the usual raise-or-waive standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The revision to the guidelines involved the number of levels that should be added to a defendant's base offense level in a case where, as here, criminally derived funds were knowingly laundered.  The extent, timing, and effect of the revision are explained in our earlier opinion, seeConnell, 960 F.2d at 197, and we will not rehearse those details here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Connell filed this motion in the district court on November 24, 1992, and filed an amended motion on December 23, 1992.  For ease in reference, we treat these pleadings as a single motion, sometimes styled the \"December 1992 motion for reconsideration.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although the government has not raised the point, we question whether the district court, so long after the appeal period expired, had jurisdiction to entertain Connell's motion for reconsideration.  SeeUnited States v. Miller, 869 F.2d 1418, 1421 (10th Cir.1989) (ruling that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a motion to reconsider in a criminal case where defendant filed the motion twenty-one months after the date on which the appeal period [10 days] began to run);  United States v. Cook, 670 F.2d 46, 48 (5th Cir.)  (holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a motion for rehearing filed fifty-seven days after the entry of final judgment in a criminal case), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 982, 102 S.Ct. 2255, 72 L.Ed.2d 860 (1982).  We need not probe the point, however, for it is settled that an appellate court may forego the resolution of a jurisdictional question if, as is true here, the appeal is uncomplicated and easily resolved in favor of the party to whose benefit the jurisdictional question would redound.

For the reasons limned herein, we affirm the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant Gerald Connell pleaded guilty to an information that charged him with structuring cash transactions to avoid certain reporting requirements.  See 31 U.S.C. Secs. 5313, 5324 (1988).  At a sentencing hearing held on June 26, 1991, the district court imposed a prison sentence (thirty months) that fell within the guideline sentencing range (GSR), fixed a supervised release period, fined Connell $15,000, and directed him to pay the costs of his forthcoming confinement at the rate of $1,415.56 per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connell appealed, complaining that his offense level had been improperly constituted, thereby inflating the GSR.  We affirmed the sentence, seeUnited States v. Connell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580693\"><a href=\"/opinion/580693/united-states-v-gerald-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1992), but with the proviso that the district court, on remand, nevertheless might consider whether an intervening change in the sentencing guidelines warranted adjustment of the sentence.  Seeid. at 199.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the case returned to the district court, defendant sought an adjustment of sentence based on the changed guideline and also moved for reconsideration of the $15,000 fine.  The court heard oral argument on May 7, 1992.  It issued an order on that date recomputing the GSR in line with the revised guideline and reducing Connell's prison term to twenty-seven months, but leaving the fine intact.  The cost-of-confinement portion of the sentence remained unchallenged and unchanged (except that the court's estimate of overall cost was lowered to reflect the three-month decrease in the term of immurement).  An amended judgment was entered on or about May 28, 1992.  Connell appealed from the order and judgment, but let the appeal slide.  The amended judgment thus became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some seven months later, Connell shifted gears.  He retained new counsel and filed a further motion for reconsideration of sentence in which he raised, for the first time, a complaint about the cost-of-confinement order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court denied the motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Sec. 5E1.2(i), which provides for cost-of-confinement orders in certain criminal cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> is unconstitutional or, alternatively, is in excess of the Sentencing Commission's statutory powers.

Bell originally challenged his sentence as a career offender under the sentencing guidelines, contending that the offense of convictionbeing a felon in possession of a firearm--was not a crime of violence.

Bell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584510\"><a href=\"/opinion/584510/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 704 (1st Cir.1992) (Bell I ).   Bell contended that he should have been sentenced instead under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1) (1988).  SeeBell <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602344\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/602344/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>;  Bell <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584510\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/584510/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span>.   We sustained Bell's appeal, holding \"that, where the offense of conviction is the offense of being a convicted felon in knowing possession of a firearm, the conviction is not for a 'crime of violence' and that, therefore, the career offender provision of the federal sentencing guidelines does not apply.\"  Bell <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584510\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/584510/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>.

That is to say, law-of-the-case rules afford courts the security of consistency within a single case while at the same time avoiding the wastefulness, delay, and overall wheel-spinning that attend piecemeal consideration of matters which might have been previously adjudicated.  See 18 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Sec. 4478 at 603 (Supp.1993).

In 1991, the district court invoked U.S.S.G. Sec. 5E1.2(i) and sentenced Connell, inter alia, to pay the costs of his confinement.  Connell appealed his sentence, but eschewed any challenge to the cost-of-confinement order.

He then compounded his difficulties by omitting any reference to the order in the proceedings that immediately followed our remand.  His afterthought request for reconsideration, occurring, as it did, some seven months after the district court had fulfilled its mission on remand--and well beyond the expiration of the appeal period in respect to the revised sentence--came too late.

But, the exceptions are narrowly configured and seldom invoked, and this case has none of the requisite earmarks:  no new evidence has been unearthed, no controlling precedent has emerged suddenly, the motion for reconsideration contained no suggestion that Connell lacks the means to pay the cost-of-commitment impost, the delay in raising the point is unexcused and seems excessive, and, most importantly, we are unpersuaded that the \"decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559873\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera-Martinez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/559873/united-states-v-hector-rivera-martinez-aka-el-men/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">151</span> </a></span>(quoting <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"275864\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">White,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/275864/james-h-white-trustee-in-bankruptcy-for-las-olas-inn-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>).

Vose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495428\"><a href=\"/opinion/495428/joseph-a-puleio-v-george-a-vose-jr-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span>, 1203 (1st Cir.1987) (\"The law ministers to the vigilant not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span> </span>(1988).  So it is here:  appellant, having failed to challenge the cost-of-confinement order in a timeous manner, must bear the predictable consequences of his neglect.  On the facts of this case, we discern no injustice in holding appellant to the usual raise-or-waive standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The revision to the guidelines involved the number of levels that should be added to a defendant's base offense level in a case where, as here, criminally derived funds were knowingly laundered.

For ease in reference, we treat these pleadings as a single motion, sometimes styled the \"December 1992 motion for reconsideration.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although the government has not raised the point, we question whether the district court, so long after the appeal period expired, had jurisdiction to entertain Connell's motion for reconsideration.  SeeUnited States v. Miller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519619\"><a href=\"/opinion/519619/united-states-v-herbert-g-miller-ii/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1418</span></a></span>, 1421 (10th Cir.1989) (ruling that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a motion to reconsider in a criminal case where defendant filed the motion twenty-one months after the date on which the appeal period [10 days] began to run);  United States v. Cook, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></span>, 48 (5th Cir.)  (holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a motion for rehearing filed fifty-seven days after the entry of final judgment in a criminal case), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">982</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span> </span>(1982).  We need not probe the point, however, for it is settled that an appellate court may forego the resolution of a jurisdictional question if, as is true here, the appeal is uncomplicated and easily resolved in favor of the party to whose benefit the jurisdictional question would redound.

Sec. 3E1.1, Connell's December 1992 motion for reconsideration also asserted an entitlement to a more extravagant credit for acceptance of responsibility.  The district court hewed to the original two-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility because it did not believe that the 1992 amendment could be applied retroactively.  This court later reached the same conclusion in an unrelated case.  SeeUnited States v. Desouza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608837\"><a href=\"/opinion/608837/barbara-bushway-desouza-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 324 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam).
