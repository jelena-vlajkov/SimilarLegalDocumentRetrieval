The mortgagee \"must act\n          in  good  faith and  must  use reasonable\n          diligence to protect the interests of the\n          mortgagor.\"  The motgagee's duty  is more\n          exacting when it becomes the buyer of the\n          property.  \"When a party who is intrusted\n          with  a power  to sell  attempts also  to\n          become  the purchaser, he will be held to\n          the strictest  good faith and  the utmost\n          diligence  for  the  protection   of  the\n          rights  of  his  principal.\"   Consistent\n          with  these  requirements, the  mortgagee\n          has a duty \"to obtain for the property as\n          large a price as possible.\"\n\nWilliams v.

Peterson, 373 Mass. 316, 328 (1977).\r                                            \n\n          The  bankruptcy court  made  the following  factual\n\nfindings at the June 4, 1992, proceeding:\n\n          I find that the  fair market value of the\n          property at  the  time of  the  sale  was\n          $135,000.  . . . I find  that it was more\n          likely  than not  --  whether or  not the\n          sale  was advertised as a two-family sale\n          or as a sale  with an in-law apartment or\n          words of that affect .  . . that in  June\n          of '91, it was  more likely than not that\n          no  qualified  bidders  would appear  who\n          would  be  prepared  to  bid   more  than\n          seventy percent of fair market value.   I\n          find  that the  bank acted  in accordance\n          with  custom that has  developed over the\n          last few  years in bidding in  at what it\n          believed  to be  seventy  percent of  the\n          fair market value. . .  . I do find  that\n          there  were code  violations, and  . .  .\n          this property as a two-family, would have\n          been in violation of the zoning bylaw . .\n          .   ,  even   though  a   certificate  of\n          occupancy had been issued.\n\nIn  light  of  those  findings,  the  court  ruled  that  the\n\nadvertisements  placed by  WCIS were  not unreasonable.   The\n\nappraiser,  on   whom  the  bank  relied,   \"was  not  acting\n\nunreasonably in determining that this was essentially a . . .\n\nsingle-family home.\" \n\n          The  burden  is on  appellants  to  prove that  the\n\nbankruptcy  court's factual  findings are  clearly erroneous.\n\nSee In re Payeur, 22 B.R. 516, 519 (U.S. Bankruptcy Panel for\r                            \n\nthe  First Circuit, 1982).

Holmes Transp., Inc., 983 F.2d 1122 (1st Cir. 1993)\r                                          \n\n(citation omitted).\n\n          WCIS hired  ATR  Appraisal Consultants  (\"ATR\")  to\n\nprepare  two  appraisals  of  the subject  property,  one  in\n\nNovember,  1990 (prior  to the  first scheduled  sale  of the\n\nproperty,  which was  postponed  when the  Simones filed  for\n\nbankruptcy)  and one  in  May,  1991  (prior  to  the  second\n\nscheduled  sale of  the  property).   The November  appraisal\n\nnoted in an addendum that the property consisted of a \"multi-\n\nlevel  style dwelling with finished basement set up as an in-\n\nlaw apartment.\"   ATR  explained  its decision  to treat  the\n\ndwelling as a single-family as follows:\n\n          As   the  basement   apartment  contained\n          windows which did not  appear to be  code\n          and   as   its  present   layout  created\n          functional  problems,   the  subject  was\n          treated as a single family residence with\n          finished  basement.   It  should  also be\n          noted  that  current zoning  requirements\n          require an  8,000 sq.  ft. lot for  a two\n          family dwelling.   It  is not known  if a\n          permit was  filed  in order  to obtain  a\n          variance  to  allow   for  a   two-family\n          building.\n\nThe  November  report  estimated  the  market  value  of  the\n\nproperty to be $144,000.  \n\n        ATR's May 1991 report, noting that \"market appears to\n\nbe declining,\"  estimated the  property's market value  to be\n\n$135,000.  The second appraisal  also treated the dwelling as\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\na single-family given the  condition of the unit  revealed by\n\nthe November, 1990  inspection.  (ATR was unable  to re-enter\n\nthe apartment  for inspection  in May,  1991.)   Both reports\n\nrelied  primarily  upon the  \"Sales  Comparison Approach\"  as\n\nyielding the most accurate  estimate of the property's market\n\nvalue.    ATR  noted  that  \"[t]ypically  the  price paid  at\n\nforeclosure is  substantially less than the  indicated Market\r                                         \n\nValue of  the  foreclosed property.\"    The May  1991  report\n\nestimated a  foreclosure sale  value of between  $108,000 and\n\n$115,000.\n\n          The  Simones  contend  that  ATR's  appraisals were\n\nunreasonable in failing to treat the dwelling as a two-family\n\nand in  failing to apply the \"income  approach\" to estimating\n\nits market value.   That contention is  undercut, however, by\n\ntheir  own appraiser's  report.   Thomas  Head, an  appraiser\n\nhired  by the Simones, testified  at trial that his November,\n\n1991 appraisal,  which treated the dwelling  as a two-family,\n\nestimated the market value of the property at that time to be\n\n$135,000.   Therefore,  whether  treating the  dwelling as  a\n\nsingle-family with  a finished  basement or as  a two-family,\n\nthe appraisals  arrived at  the same estimated  market value.\n\nIn  addition, ATR researched the  value of the  property as a\n\ntwo-family dwelling and  concluded in a June  18, 1991 letter\n\nto WCIS that the estimated value would remain in the $135,000\n\nto $145,000 range.       At  trial,  Kimberly Comeau  (one of\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nthe two  ATR appraisers  who prepared the  reports) testified\n\nthat her visit  to the  Building Department for  the City  of\n\nWorcester had revealed that current zoning required a minimum\n\nlot  size of 8,000 square  feet for a  two-family dwelling at\n\nthe relevant location.  Given  that the subject lot contained\n\nonly 7,960 square feet and that there  was no evidence that a\n\nspecial permit  had been  granted, Ms. Comeau  concluded that\n\nthe  use  of  the  property as  a  two-family  dwelling would\n\nviolate the applicable zoning  laws.  The Simones argue  that\n\nthe Certificate of Occupancy  issued to them by  the Building\n\nDepartment  in 1987, when  they converted the  basement to an\n\napartment, demonstrates  that the  unit does not  violate the\n\nzoning laws.\n\n          Even assuming, without deciding,  that ATR erred in\n\nconcluding  that the  use  of the  property  as a  two-family\n\ndwelling  violated  the zoning  laws,  that  error would  not\n\ninvalidate its estimate of market  value or its treatment  of\n\nthe dwelling as  a single-family.   As Ms.  Comeau stated  at\n\ntrial, ATR's decision to  appraise the dwelling as  a single-\n\nfamily dwelling was based upon a conclusion that \"the highest\n\nand best use of  the subject property was as  a single-family\n\nresidence.\"    She  explained  that  she  believed  that  the\n\nproperty  would not  be  purchased as  a  two-family for  the\n\nfollowing reasons:\n\n               Well, based on our findings upon the\n          inspection  in which  the  layout of  the\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n          basement    unit    was    awkward    and\n          unconventional.      We  also   had  some\n          questions as to possible code violations.\n          In  addition,  we did  consider  the two-\n          family market;  and due to  risk involved\n          in the two-family  market, we  determined\n          that  the  highest and  best  use of  the\n          property was that of a single-family.\n\nA  May  17,  1991,   Code  Inspection  Report  noted  several\n\nviolations in  the basement apartment.   Although that report\n\nwas  not received  by  WCIS  until  after  the  sale  of  the\n\nproperty, it confirms ATR's impression (noted in its reports)\n\nthat code violations were present in the basement unit.2\n\n          WCIS admits that it  considered the income from the\n\nsecond  unit in  granting a  second mortgage  on  the subject\n\nproperty  and that it  insured the property  as a two-family.\n\nThose decisions,  however, may merely reflect  the actual use\n\nof  the  property as  a two-family  dwelling at  the relevant\n\ntimes.   It does not necessarily follow, and the Simones have\n\nfailed to  demonstrate, that WCIS was  obligated to advertise\n\nthe property as  a two-family  because it was  being used  as\n\nsuch at  the time of the  sale.  ATR  determined that single-\n\nfamily  occupancy  was  the  \"highest  and  best  use of  the\n\nproperty\",  i.e., \"the  most  profitable and  feasible\"  use.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  The code inspection was  performed in response to reports\nof violations  by the upstairs tenant,  who allegedly offered\nto purchase the property for $154,900 in February, 1991.  The\nSimones  cite the  offer  as evidence  that  WCIS could  have\nobtained  a  higher price  for the  property  if it  had been\nadvertised  as a  two-family.   Mr.  Simone  admitted at  his\ndeposition, however,  that the sale fell  through for unknown\nreasons. \n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nWCIS reasonably relied upon that determination in advertising\n\nthe property.\n\n          The  Simones argue  that if  the property  had been\n\nadvertised as  a two-family  dwelling, there would  have been\n\nmore bidders and, consequently, a higher purchase price would\n\nhave resulted.   Plaintiff's professional auctioneer witness,\n\nhowever, only testified that  if the property were advertised\n\nas  a  two-family,  it  would  have  attracted  a  \"different\n\naudience.\"    Given  ATR's  reasonable  conclusion  that  the\n\n\"highest  and  best use\"  of the  property  was as  a single-\n\nfamily,  WCIS'  decision to  advertise  it  as  such did  not\n\nviolate its duty to the Simones.\n\n          Based upon the above evidence, we conclude that the\n\nbankruptcy  court did  not err  in dismissing  the complaint.\n\nAfter reviewing the entire  record, we are not left  with the\n\n\"definite and  firm  conviction,\" I.C.C.  v. Holmes  Transp.,\r                                                                         \n\nInc.,  983   F.2d  at  1129,  that   the  bankruptcy  court's\r                \n\nconclusion that WCIS acted  in good faith was mistaken.   Nor\n\nare we persuaded  that the court  was mistaken in  concluding\n\nthat WCIS reasonably relied upon ATR's determination that the\n\nproperty  was  essentially  a   single  family  home.3    The\n\nbankruptcy court properly  concluded that the Simones  failed\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.    We note that the  record indicates that the Simones did\nnot  object to the advertisement of the dwelling as a single-\nfamily  until after  the  sale occurred,  although the  first\nadvertisement was published approximately six months earlier,\nin November, 1990.\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nto prove that  the advertisement and  sale of the  foreclosed\n\nproperty amounted to a breach of WCIS' common law duty to the\n\nSimones.\n\n          II.

Section  2(a) of  chapter 93A makes  unlawful \"unfair  or\n\ndeceptive  acts or practices in  the conduct of  any trade or\n\ncommerce.\" Section 9 authorizes  suit by \"[a]ny person, other\n\nthan a person entitled  to bring action under  section eleven\n\nof this chapter, who has been injured by another person's use\n\nor employment of any  method, act or practice declared  to be\n\nunlawful by section two . . . .\"  Section  11 authorizes suit\n\nby  persons  who \"engage[]  in the  conduct  of any  trade or\n\ncommerce.\"\n\n          It is unclear, and neither the bankruptcy court nor\n\nthe district  court addressed the issue,  whether the Simones\n\nwere  \"engaged in  the  conduct of  trade  or commerce\"  and,\n\ntherefore, required to  bring suit  under   11.  The test  is\n\n\"whether  the  defendant's conduct  giving  rise  to the  93A\n\nviolation  occurred in  connection  with .  .  . a  plaintiff\n\nindividual  acting  in  a  business  context.\"    Michael  C.\n\nGilleran,  The Law of Chapter 93A    8.5 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1994).\r                                             \n\nAt the time  of the  foreclosure and sale,  the Simones  were\n\nrenting the  subject dwelling  to two  families, and were  no\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nlonger living there  themselves. Section  1(b) defines  trade\n\nand  commerce to  include  \"the rent  .  .  . of  .  . .  any\n\nproperty.\"\n\n          It is unnecessary  to resolve this  issue, however,\n\nsince the Simones have failed  to meet the requisite standard\n\nunder either   11 or   9.  \"The defendant in a   9  case will\n\nor  will not  have  violated    9  depending on  whether  the\n\ndefendant acted in an  equitable manner toward the plaintiff.\n\nThe  equity  standard  in      9  cases  requires  that   the\n\ndefendant's   conduct  not  have  violated  some  established\n\nconcept of  unfairness or  otherwise  be immoral,  unethical,\n\noppressive  or  unscrupulous.\"  M.

Given  those findings,  which were  not\n\nclearly  erroneous, we  conclude that  the Simones  failed to\n\nestablish that WCIS' conduct violated  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A.\n\nTherefore,  the bankruptcy  court did  not err  in dismissing\n\nthat claim.\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\n          III.  Sequestering of Witnesses\r                                                     \n\n          The Simones argue  on appeal, as they did  in their\n\nmotion for  reconsideration, that the  sequestering of  Linda\n\nSimone during the trial violated their rights.  Fed. R. Evid.\n\n615 provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n               At the request of  a party the court\n          shall  order  witnesses excluded  so that\n          they cannot hear  the testimony of  other\n          witnesses, and it  may make the  order of\n          its  own  motion.    This rule  does  not\n          authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is\n          a natural person . . . .\n\nThe  district  court  ruled as  follows  in  response to  the\n\nSimones' motion for reconsideration:\n\n               Having reviewed the trial transcript\n          in connection with appellants' contention\n          that   Linda    Simone   was   improperly\n          sequestered   at    trial,   and   having\n          concluded   that   she  was   sequestered\n          pursuant to the motion of counsel for the\n          Simones,  it  is   hereby  Ordered   that\n          appellants'   motion  to   reconsider  is\n          DENIED.\n\nWe  agree  with the  district court  that  by moving  for the\n\nsequestration  of  witnesses,  specifically  including  Linda\n\nSimone,  and  by  failing  to object  during  the  bankruptcy\n\nproceeding to  the sequestering of Linda  Simone, the Simones\n\nwaived the issue.   Cf. United States v. Abbott,  30 F.3d 71,\r                                                           \n\n73  (7th Cir. 1994) (failure to move for exclusion of witness\n\nat trial constitutes waiver of  argument on appeal that court\n\nerred  in failing to exclude  witness); Hull v.

See United States v. Bobo, 586 F.2d 355, 366 (5th\r                                                 \n\nCir.  1978) (party seeking reversal  on basis of violation of\n\nFed.  R.

Partiality Claim\r                                           \n\n          The Simones argue that  the Bankruptcy Judge  ought\n\nto have disqualified himself from presiding over the June  4,\n\n1992,  trial.  They argue  that his previous employment as an\n\nattorney at a law firm where defense counsel was then working\n\nas  a paralegal, required his  recusal.  They further suggest\n\nan  additional conflict:   that the  judge's former  law firm\n\nrepresented WCIS.   A motion for recusal was  not made to the\n\nbankruptcy court.  Instead, the Simones raised the partiality\n\nissue  for the first time  in their Rule  60(b)(2) motion for\n\nrelief  from  judgment  on  the ground  of  newly  discovered\n\nevidence.  The motion was filed and denied while the Simones'\n\nmotion for reconsideration pursuant to  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e)\n\nwas pending.  The Simones  did not appeal from the  denial of\n\ntheir Rule 60(b) motion and WCIS argues that, therefore, they\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nhave waived  the issue.   We need not decide  the question of\n\nwaiver  since  we  conclude  that  the  partiality  claim  is\n\nentirely without merit.  \n\n          WCIS  admits that  its counsel \"from  October, 1978\n\nthrough June  1985, . . . was a paralegal employed at the law\n\nfirm  of Bowditch &amp; Dewey  and during that  time often worked\n\nwith  Judge Queenan,  who, during  that same  period, was   a\n\nlawyer and member  of the  firm.\"  Contrary  to the  Simones'\n\ncontention on  appeal,  however, those  circumstances do  not\n\nrequire recusal.  The relevant statute provides as follows:\n\n          Any  justice, judge or  magistrate of the\n          United States shall disqualify himself in\n          any proceeding in which  his impartiality\n          might reasonably be questioned.\n\n28  U.S.C.   455.  This court  has interpreted the statute to\n\nrequire disqualification \"`only if  the facts provide what an\n\nobjective, knowledgeable  member of the public  would find to\n\nbe   a   reasonable   basis    for   doubting   the   judge's\r                                       \n\nimpartiality.'\"  In re Allied Signal, Inc., 891 F.2d 967, 970\r                                                      \n\n(1st Cir.  1989) (citations omitted), cert.  denied, 495 U.S.\r                                                               \n\n957 (1990).  WCIS' counsel's employment, seven years earlier,\n\nas  a paralegal at the  firm where the  Bankruptcy Judge then\n\nworked  as an  attorney,  and her  work  with the  Judge,  on\n\nmatters unrelated to the  present controversy, do not provide\n\na \"reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality\" in\n\nthis case.

I find that it was more likely than not-whether or not the sale was advertised as a two-family sale or as a sale with an in-law apartment or words of that affect ... that in June of '91, it was more likely than not that no qualified bidders would appear who would be prepared to bid more than seventy percent of fair market value.  I find that the bank acted in accordance with custom that has developed over the last few years in bidding in at what it believed to be seventy percent of the fair market value....  I do find that there were code violations, and ... this property as a two-family, would have been in violation of the zoning bylaw ..., even though a certificate of occupancy had been issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of those findings, the court ruled that the advertisements placed by WCIS were not unreasonable.

The November appraisal noted in an addendum that the property consisted of a \"multi-level style dwelling with finished basement set up as an in-law apartment.\"  ATR explained its decision to treat the dwelling as a single- family as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>As the basement apartment contained windows which did not appear to be code and as its present layout created functional problems, the subject was treated as a single family residence with finished basement.  It should also be noted that current zoning requirements require an 8,000 sq. ft. lot for a two family dwelling.  It is not known if a permit was filed in order to obtain a variance to allow for a two-family building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The November report estimated the market value of the property to be $144,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ATR's May 1991 report, noting that \"market appears to be declining,\" estimated the property's market value to be $135,000.  The second appraisal also treated the dwelling as a single-family given the condition of the unit revealed by the November, 1990 inspection.  (ATR was unable to re-enter the apartment for inspection in May, 1991.)  Both reports relied primarily upon the \"Sales Comparison Approach\" as yielding the most accurate estimate of the property's market value.  ATR noted that \"[t]ypically the price paid at foreclosure is substantially less than the indicated Market Value of the foreclosed property.\"  The May 1991 report estimated a foreclosure sale value of between $108,000 and $115,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Simones contend that ATR's appraisals were unreasonable in failing to treat the dwelling as a two-family and in failing to apply the \"income approach\" to estimating its market value.  That contention is undercut, however, by their own appraiser's report.  Thomas Head, an appraiser hired by the Simones, testified at trial that his November, 1991 appraisal, which treated the dwelling as a two-family, estimated the market value of the property at that time to be $135,000.  Therefore, whether treating the dwelling as a single-family with a finished basement or as a two-family, the appraisals arrived at the same estimated market value.  In addition, ATR researched the value of the property as a two-family dwelling and concluded in a June 18, 1991 letter to WCIS that the estimated value would remain in the $135,000 to $145,000 range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Kimberly Comeau (one of the two ATR appraisers who prepared the reports) testified that her visit to the Building Department for the City of Worcester had revealed that current zoning required a minimum lot size of 8,000 square feet for a two-family dwelling at the relevant location.  Given that the subject lot contained only 7,960 square feet and that there was no evidence that a special permit had been granted, Ms. Comeau concluded that the use of the property as a two-family dwelling would violate the applicable zoning laws.  The Simones argue that the Certificate of Occupancy issued to them by the Building Department in 1987, when they converted the basement to an apartment, demonstrates that the unit does not violate the zoning laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, without deciding, that ATR erred in concluding that the use of the property as a two-family dwelling violated the zoning laws, that error would not invalidate its estimate of market value or its treatment of the dwelling as a single-family.  As Ms. Comeau stated at trial, ATR's decision to appraise the dwelling as a single-family dwelling was based upon a conclusion that \"the highest and best use of the subject property was as a single-family residence.\"  She explained that she believed that the property would not be purchased as a two-family for the following reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Well, based on our findings upon the inspection in which the layout of the basement unit was awkward and unconventional.  We also had some questions as to possible code violations.  In addition, we did consider the two- family market;  and due to risk involved in the two-family market, we determined that the highest and best use of the property was that of a single-family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A May 17, 1991, Code Inspection Report noted several violations in the basement apartment.  Although that report was not received by WCIS until after the sale of the property, it confirms ATR's impression (noted in its reports) that code violations were present in the basement unit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WCIS admits that it considered the income from the second unit in granting a second mortgage on the subject property and that it insured the property as a two-family.  Those decisions, however, may merely reflect the actual use of the property as a two-family dwelling at the relevant times.  It does not necessarily follow, and the Simones have failed to demonstrate, that WCIS was obligated to advertise the property as a two-family because it was being used as such at the time of the sale.  ATR determined that single-family occupancy was the \"highest and best use of the property\", i.e., \"the most profitable and feasible\" use.  WCIS reasonably relied upon that determination in advertising the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Simones argue that if the property had been advertised as a two-family dwelling, there would have been more bidders and, consequently, a higher purchase price would have resulted.  Plaintiff's professional auctioneer witness, however, only testified that if the property were advertised as a two-family, it would have attracted a \"different audience.\"  Given ATR's reasonable conclusion that the \"highest and best use\" of the property was as a single-family, WCIS' decision to advertise it as such did not violate its duty to the Simones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon the above evidence, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing the complaint.  After reviewing the entire record, we are not left with the \"definite and firm conviction,\" I.C.C. v. Holmes Transp., Inc., 983 F.2d at 1129, that the bankruptcy court's conclusion that WCIS acted in good faith was mistaken.  Nor are we persuaded that the court was mistaken in concluding that WCIS reasonably relied upon ATR's determination that the property was essentially a single family home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The bankruptcy court properly concluded that the Simones failed to prove that the advertisement and sale of the foreclosed property amounted to a breach of WCIS' common law duty to the Simones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Mass. Gen. L. ch.  93A Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint also alleged that WCIS' advertisement and sale of the foreclosed property violated c. 93A Secs. 2 and 9. Section 2(a) of chapter 93A makes unlawful \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"  Section 9 authorizes suit by \"[a]ny person, other than a person entitled to bring action under section eleven of this chapter, who has been injured by another person's use or employment of any method, act or practice declared to be unlawful by section two....\"  Section 11 authorizes suit by persons who \"engage[ ] in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear, and neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court addressed the issue, whether the Simones were \"engaged in the conduct of trade or commerce\" and, therefore, required to bring suit under Sec. 11.  The test is \"whether the defendant's conduct giving rise to the 93A violation occurred in connection with ... a plaintiff individual acting in a business context.\"  Michael C. Gilleran, The Law of Chapter 93A Sec. 8.5 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1994).  At the time of the foreclosure and sale, the Simones were renting the subject dwelling to two families, and were no longer living there themselves.  Section 1(b) defines trade and commerce to include \"the rent ... of ... any property.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unnecessary to resolve this issue, however, since the Simones have failed to meet the requisite standard under either Sec. 11 or Sec. 9. \"The defendant in a Sec. 9 case will or will not have violated Sec. 9 depending on whether the defendant acted in an equitable manner toward the plaintiff.  The equity standard in Sec. 9 cases requires that the defendant's conduct not have violated some established concept of unfairness or otherwise be immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous.\"  M. Gilleran, supra, Sec. 4.7 (citing cases);  see also Gerli v. G.K. Hall &amp; Co., 851 F.2d 452, 454 (1st Cir. 1988).  \"A plaintiff claiming unfairness under Sec. 11 must show rascality, that is, a violation of conventional business ethical norms.\"  M. Gilleran, supra, Sec. 4.8 (citing cases);  see also Midwest Precision Services, Inc. v. PTM Inds.  Corp., 887 F.2d 1128, 1139 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court specifically found that WCIS acted in good faith and that it behaved in a commercially reasonable manner.  Given those findings, which were not clearly erroneous, we conclude that the Simones failed to establish that WCIS' conduct violated Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  93A. Therefore, the bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Sequestering of Witnesses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Simones argue on appeal, as they did in their motion for reconsideration, that the sequestering of Linda Simone during the trial violated their rights.  Fed. R. Evid. 615 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion.  This rule does not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled as follows in response to the Simones' motion for reconsideration:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Having reviewed the trial transcript in connection with appellants' contention that Linda Simone was improperly sequestered at trial, and having concluded that she was sequestered pursuant to the motion of counsel for the Simones, it is hereby Ordered that appellants' motion to reconsider is DENIED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that by moving for the sequestration of witnesses, specifically including Linda Simone, and by failing to object during the bankruptcy proceeding to the sequestering of Linda Simone, the Simones waived the issue.  Cf. United States v. Abbott, 30 F.3d 71, 73 (7th Cir. 1994) (failure to move for exclusion of witness at trial constitutes waiver of argument on appeal that court erred in failing to exclude witness);  Hull v. Merck &amp; Co., 758 F.2d 1474, 1478 (11th Cir. 1985) (denying request for new trial where plaintiff had been excluded from courtroom in violation of Fed.  R. Evid. 615(1), but plaintiff-after returning to the courtroom-agreed to proceed with trial).  Moreover, the Simones have failed to  demonstrate any prejudice as a result of Linda Simone's exclusion from the courtroom.  See United States v. Bobo, 586 F.2d 355, 366 (5th Cir. 1978) (party seeking reversal on basis of violation of Fed.  R. Evid. 615 must demonstrate prejudice therefrom), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 976 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Partiality Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Simones argue that the Bankruptcy Judge ought to have disqualified himself from presiding over the June 4, 1992, trial.  They argue that his previous employment as an attorney at a law firm where defense counsel was then working as a paralegal, required his recusal.  They further suggest an additional conflict:  that the judge's former law firm represented WCIS.  A motion for recusal was not made to the bankruptcy court.  Instead, the Simones raised the partiality issue for the first time in their Rule 60(b)(2) motion for relief from judgment on the ground of newly discovered evidence.  The motion was filed and denied while the Simones' motion for reconsideration pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 59(e) was pending.  The Simones did not appeal from the denial of their Rule 60(b) motion and WCIS argues that, therefore, they have waived the issue.  We need not decide the question of waiver since we conclude that the partiality claim is entirely without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WCIS admits that its counsel \"from October, 1978 through June 1985, ... was a paralegal employed at the law firm of Bowditch &amp; Dewey and during that time often worked with Judge Queenan, who, during that same period, was a lawyer and member of the firm.\"  Contrary to the Simones' contention on appeal, however, those circumstances do not require recusal.  The relevant statute provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>Any justice, judge or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. Sec. 455.  This court has interpreted the statute to require disqualification \" 'only if the facts provide what an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.' \"  In re Allied Signal, Inc., 891 F.2d 967, 970 (1st Cir. 1989) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 957 (1990).  WCIS' counsel's employment, seven years earlier, as a paralegal at the firm where the Bankruptcy Judge then worked as an attorney, and her work with the Judge, on matters unrelated to the present controversy, do not provide a \"reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality\" in this case.  See Singer v. Wadman, 745 F.2d 606, 608 (10th Cir. 1984) (holding that judge's former partnership with a lawyer for one of the defendants did not require disqualification), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1028 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Simones' allegation that the Bankruptcy Judge's former law firm represented WCIS require recusal.  \"[A] charge of partiality must be supported by a factual basis.\"  Allied Signal, 891 F.2d at 970.  Here, the Simones have provided only the following vague suggestion of partiality:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>[The Bankruptcy Judge] at one point either worked at the Law Firm of Bowdwitch &amp; Dewey of Worcester Ma. or Fletcher Tilton &amp; Whipple of Worcester, Ma. and ... either of these two Firms handled the accounts for W.C.I.S. Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the factual basis were adequate, the alleged relationships would not necessarily require recusal.  See National Auto Brokers v. General Motors Corp., 572 F.2d 953 n.9 (2d Cir. 1978) (citing Sec. 455(b)(2) and noting that \"[e]ven under the more stringent requirements of the current statute, ... the prior representation of [defendant] by [judge's prior law firm and judge] as to unrelated matters would not require him to recuse himself\"), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1072 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's affirmance of the bankruptcy court's dismissal of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Simones' brief contains myriad vague and unsupported claims of tampering with evidence and improper behavior by counsel for both parties.

Mr. Simone admitted at his deposition, however, that the sale fell through for unknown reasons</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that the record indicates that the Simones did not object to the advertisement of the dwelling as a single- family until after the sale occurred, although the first advertisement was published approximately six months earlier, in November, 1990</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The November appraisal noted in an addendum that the property consisted of a \"multi-level style dwelling with finished basement set up as an in-law apartment.\"  ATR explained its decision to treat the dwelling as a single- family as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>As the basement apartment contained windows which did not appear to be code and as its present layout created functional problems, the subject was treated as a single family residence with finished basement.  It should also be noted that current zoning requirements require an 8,000 sq. ft. lot for a two family dwelling.  It is not known if a permit was filed in order to obtain a variance to allow for a two-family building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The November report estimated the market value of the property to be $144,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ATR's May 1991 report, noting that \"market appears to be declining,\" estimated the property's market value to be $135,000.  The second appraisal also treated the dwelling as a single-family given the condition of the unit revealed by the November, 1990 inspection.  (ATR was unable to re-enter the apartment for inspection in May, 1991.)  Both reports relied primarily upon the \"Sales Comparison Approach\" as yielding the most accurate estimate of the property's market value.  ATR noted that \"[t]ypically the price paid at foreclosure is substantially less than the indicated Market Value of the foreclosed property.\"  The May 1991 report estimated a foreclosure sale value of between $108,000 and $115,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Simones contend that ATR's appraisals were unreasonable in failing to treat the dwelling as a two-family and in failing to apply the \"income approach\" to estimating its market value.  That contention is undercut, however, by their own appraiser's report.  Thomas Head, an appraiser hired by the Simones, testified at trial that his November, 1991 appraisal, which treated the dwelling as a two-family, estimated the market value of the property at that time to be $135,000.  Therefore, whether treating the dwelling as a single-family with a finished basement or as a two-family, the appraisals arrived at the same estimated market value.  In addition, ATR researched the value of the property as a two-family dwelling and concluded in a June 18, 1991 letter to WCIS that the estimated value would remain in the $135,000 to $145,000 range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Kimberly Comeau (one of the two ATR appraisers who prepared the reports) testified that her visit to the Building Department for the City of Worcester had revealed that current zoning required a minimum lot size of 8,000 square feet for a two-family dwelling at the relevant location.  Given that the subject lot contained only 7,960 square feet and that there was no evidence that a special permit had been granted, Ms. Comeau concluded that the use of the property as a two-family dwelling would violate the applicable zoning laws.  The Simones argue that the Certificate of Occupancy issued to them by the Building Department in 1987, when they converted the basement to an apartment, demonstrates that the unit does not violate the zoning laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, without deciding, that ATR erred in concluding that the use of the property as a two-family dwelling violated the zoning laws, that error would not invalidate its estimate of market value or its treatment of the dwelling as a single-family.  As Ms. Comeau stated at trial, ATR's decision to appraise the dwelling as a single-family dwelling was based upon a conclusion that \"the highest and best use of the subject property was as a single-family residence.\"  She explained that she believed that the property would not be purchased as a two-family for the following reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Well, based on our findings upon the inspection in which the layout of the basement unit was awkward and unconventional.  We also had some questions as to possible code violations.  In addition, we did consider the two- family market;  and due to risk involved in the two-family market, we determined that the highest and best use of the property was that of a single-family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A May 17, 1991, Code Inspection Report noted several violations in the basement apartment.  Although that report was not received by WCIS until after the sale of the property, it confirms ATR's impression (noted in its reports) that code violations were present in the basement unit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WCIS admits that it considered the income from the second unit in granting a second mortgage on the subject property and that it insured the property as a two-family.  Those decisions, however, may merely reflect the actual use of the property as a two-family dwelling at the relevant times.  It does not necessarily follow, and the Simones have failed to demonstrate, that WCIS was obligated to advertise the property as a two-family because it was being used as such at the time of the sale.  ATR determined that single-family occupancy was the \"highest and best use of the property\", i.e., \"the most profitable and feasible\" use.  WCIS reasonably relied upon that determination in advertising the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Simones argue that if the property had been advertised as a two-family dwelling, there would have been more bidders and, consequently, a higher purchase price would have resulted.  Plaintiff's professional auctioneer witness, however, only testified that if the property were advertised as a two-family, it would have attracted a \"different audience.\"  Given ATR's reasonable conclusion that the \"highest and best use\" of the property was as a single-family, WCIS' decision to advertise it as such did not violate its duty to the Simones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon the above evidence, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing the complaint.  After reviewing the entire record, we are not left with the \"definite and firm conviction,\" I.C.C. v. Holmes Transp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598968\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/598968/fed-carr-cas-p-83804-interstate-commerce-commission-v-holmes/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span>, that the bankruptcy court's conclusion that WCIS acted in good faith was mistaken.  Nor are we persuaded that the court was mistaken in concluding that WCIS reasonably relied upon ATR's determination that the property was essentially a single family home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The bankruptcy court properly concluded that the Simones failed to prove that the advertisement and sale of the foreclosed property amounted to a breach of WCIS' common law duty to the Simones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Mass. Gen. L. ch.  93A Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint also alleged that WCIS' advertisement and sale of the foreclosed property violated c. 93A Secs. 2 and 9. Section 2(a) of chapter 93A makes unlawful \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"  Section 9 authorizes suit by \"[a]ny person, other than a person entitled to bring action under section eleven of this chapter, who has been injured by another person's use or employment of any method, act or practice declared to be unlawful by section two....\"  Section 11 authorizes suit by persons who \"engage[ ] in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear, and neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court addressed the issue, whether the Simones were \"engaged in the conduct of trade or commerce\" and, therefore, required to bring suit under Sec. 11.  The test is \"whether the defendant's conduct giving rise to the 93A violation occurred in connection with ... a plaintiff individual acting in a business context.\"  Michael C. Gilleran, The Law of Chapter 93A Sec. 8.5 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1994).  At the time of the foreclosure and sale, the Simones were renting the subject dwelling to two families, and were no longer living there themselves.  Section 1(b) defines trade and commerce to include \"the rent ... of ... any property.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unnecessary to resolve this issue, however, since the Simones have failed to meet the requisite standard under either Sec. 11 or Sec. 9. \"The defendant in a Sec. 9 case will or will not have violated Sec. 9 depending on whether the defendant acted in an equitable manner toward the plaintiff.  The equity standard in Sec. 9 cases requires that the defendant's conduct not have violated some established concept of unfairness or otherwise be immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous.\"  M. Gilleran, supra, Sec. 4.7 (citing cases);  see also Gerli v. G.K. Hall &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508713\"><a href=\"/opinion/508713/e-michael-gerli-v-gk-hall-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 454 (1st Cir. 1988).  \"A plaintiff claiming unfairness under Sec. 11 must show rascality, that is, a violation of conventional business ethical norms.\"  M. Gilleran, supra, Sec. 4.8 (citing cases);  see also Midwest Precision Services, Inc. v. PTM Inds.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531009\"><a href=\"/opinion/531009/midwest-precision-services-inc-v-ptm-industries-corporation-midwest/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1128</span></a></span>, 1139 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court specifically found that WCIS acted in good faith and that it behaved in a commercially reasonable manner.  Given those findings, which were not clearly erroneous, we conclude that the Simones failed to establish that WCIS' conduct violated Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  93A. Therefore, the bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Sequestering of Witnesses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Simones argue on appeal, as they did in their motion for reconsideration, that the sequestering of Linda Simone during the trial violated their rights.  Fed. R. Evid. 615 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion.  This rule does not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled as follows in response to the Simones' motion for reconsideration:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Having reviewed the trial transcript in connection with appellants' contention that Linda Simone was improperly sequestered at trial, and having concluded that she was sequestered pursuant to the motion of counsel for the Simones, it is hereby Ordered that appellants' motion to reconsider is DENIED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that by moving for the sequestration of witnesses, specifically including Linda Simone, and by failing to object during the bankruptcy proceeding to the sequestering of Linda Simone, the Simones waived the issue.  Cf. United States v. Abbott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674700\"><a href=\"/opinion/674700/united-states-v-frank-edward-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 73 (7th Cir. 1994) (failure to move for exclusion of witness at trial constitutes waiver of argument on appeal that court erred in failing to exclude witness);  Hull v. Merck &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450480\"><a href=\"/opinion/450480/jim-dale-hull-v-merck-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1474</span></a></span>, 1478 (11th Cir. 1985) (denying request for new trial where plaintiff had been excluded from courtroom in violation of Fed.  R. Evid. 615(1), but plaintiff-after returning to the courtroom-agreed to proceed with trial).  Moreover, the Simones have failed to  demonstrate any prejudice as a result of Linda Simone's exclusion from the courtroom.  See United States v. Bobo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></span>, 366 (5th Cir. 1978) (party seeking reversal on basis of violation of Fed.  R. Evid. 615 must demonstrate prejudice therefrom), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span> </span>(1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Partiality Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Simones argue that the Bankruptcy Judge ought to have disqualified himself from presiding over the June 4, 1992, trial.  They argue that his previous employment as an attorney at a law firm where defense counsel was then working as a paralegal, required his recusal.  They further suggest an additional conflict:  that the judge's former law firm represented WCIS.  A motion for recusal was not made to the bankruptcy court.  Instead, the Simones raised the partiality issue for the first time in their Rule 60(b)(2) motion for relief from judgment on the ground of newly discovered evidence.  The motion was filed and denied while the Simones' motion for reconsideration pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 59(e) was pending.  The Simones did not appeal from the denial of their Rule 60(b) motion and WCIS argues that, therefore, they have waived the issue.  We need not decide the question of waiver since we conclude that the partiality claim is entirely without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WCIS admits that its counsel \"from October, 1978 through June 1985, ... was a paralegal employed at the law firm of Bowditch &amp; Dewey and during that time often worked with Judge Queenan, who, during that same period, was a lawyer and member of the firm.\"  Contrary to the Simones' contention on appeal, however, those circumstances do not require recusal.  The relevant statute provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>Any justice, judge or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. Sec. 455.  This court has interpreted the statute to require disqualification \" 'only if the facts provide what an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.' \"  In re Allied Signal, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533780\"><a href=\"/opinion/533780/in-re-allied-signal-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 970 (1st Cir. 1989) (citations omitted), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span> </span>(1990).  WCIS' counsel's employment, seven years earlier, as a paralegal at the firm where the Bankruptcy Judge then worked as an attorney, and her work with the Judge, on matters unrelated to the present controversy, do not provide a \"reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality\" in this case.  See Singer v. Wadman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442847\"><a href=\"/opinion/442847/vickie-singer-v-robert-wadman-vickie-singer-v-walter-d-talbot/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span>, 608 (10th Cir. 1984) (holding that judge's former partnership with a lawyer for one of the defendants did not require disqualification), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span> </span>(1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Simones' allegation that the Bankruptcy Judge's former law firm represented WCIS require recusal.  \"[A] charge of partiality must be supported by a factual basis.\"  Allied <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533780\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Signal,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/533780/in-re-allied-signal-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span>.
