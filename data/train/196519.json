Plaintiff James\r                                                      \r\n\nDominique, a  sentenced  inmate in  the Massachusetts  prison\r\n\nsystem, was returned to confinement after he had been allowed\r\n\nto participate  in a  work  release program  for almost  four\r\n\nyears.  He appeals from the district court's refusal to order\r\n\nreinstatement of his work release status and its dismissal of\r\n\nhis related claims,  brought under 42 U.S.C.   1983, alleging\r\n\nviolations  of  the  Due  Process Clause  of  the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment  and the Ex Post  Facto Clause.   We affirm, albeit\r\n\nfor  different  reasons  in  light of  recent  Supreme  Court\r\n\ndecisions.\r\n\nI. Facts\r            I. Facts\r\n\n          Plaintiff  was  imprisoned  in  1983  for  multiple\r\n\ncrimes including incest and is scheduled for release  in June\r\n\n2000.   In  August 1987,  he was  transferred to  the minimum\r\n\nsecurity Massachusetts Correctional Institution  at Lancaster\r\n\n(\"MCI-Lancaster\").   In May 1988, the  Superintendent of MCI-\r\n\nLancaster  permitted him  to  renew his  driver's license  in\r\n\nconnection with work he was then doing on state vehicles.  In\r\n\nAugust 1990,  plaintiff was  approved for the  Community Work\r\n\nRelease   Program.     He  became   a  mechanic   for  R.M.J.\r\n\nTransportation, Inc., and the following year was permitted to\r\n\nopen his own vehicle repair business.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Plaintiff  remained  in good  standing in  the work\r\n\nrelease program.  However,  in the summer of 1993,  access to\r\n\nhis license and the keys to his personal vehicle was revoked,\r\n\ncausing him to  lose his job  at R.M.J. Transportation.    In\r\n\nApril  of 1994, he was removed from the work release program.\r\n\nOn May 5, 1994, because he was deemed a security risk, he was\r\n\ntransferred from MCI-Lancaster to a medium security facility,\r\n\nMCI-Shirley.  No hearing occurred before the latter transfer,\r\n\nbut reclassification hearings were subsequently held  on June\r\n\n13 and September 23,  1994.  Each time, a  committee majority\r\n\nrecommended   plaintiff's  transfer   to  a   lower  security\r\n\nfacility.  The  Commissioner overruled these recommendations.\r\n\nPlaintiff remains at MCI-Shirley.\r\n\n          Defendants1  say  that  they   revoked  plaintiff's\r\n\nprivileges  because he  remains  in denial  of his  crime (in\r\n\nparticular,  the  incest),  and  because he  had  too  little\r\n\naccountability at  his repair business.   They justify taking\r\n\naway  plaintiff's license  because of revised  DOC guidelines\r\n\nproviding that only inmates within six  months of an approved\r\n\nrelease  date are eligible to  use their licenses.   They add\r\n\nthat his  crime makes him  a risk to  the public safety,  and\r\n\nthat,  having been  denied parole on  three occasions,  he is\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.     The   defendants   are  William   Weld,   Governor  of\r\nMassachusetts,  Thomas  Rapone,   then-Commissioner  of   the\r\nDepartment of Public Safety, Larry E. Dubois, Commissioner of\r\nthe Massachusetts Department of Correction, and Luis Spencer,\r\nSuperintendent of MCI-Lancaster.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nmore likely to attempt to escape.  Plaintiff responds that he\r\n\nhas  never violated  any condition  of the  Community Release\r\n\nAgreement  (\"Agreement\").2    He  claims  that  his   removal\r\n\nresulted from media and public uproar following an incident -\r\n\n-  wholly  unrelated to  him  --  in which  an  MCI-Lancaster\r\n\nescapee shot a police  officer.  Plaintiff was never  given a\r\n\nwritten  statement   of  reasons   for  his  removal.     New\r\n\nregulations concerning the  treatment of  sex offenders  make\r\n\nplaintiff presently ineligible for work release.\r\n\n          In  his  district court  action,  plaintiff alleged\r\n\nthat these  changes in  his status violated  the Due  Process\r\n\nClause  of the  Fourteenth Amendment  and the  Ex Post  Facto\r\n\nClause.  He requested  a preliminary injunction ordering that\r\n\nhe  be reinstated to the work release program.  In dismissing\r\n\nthe due process claim, the district court held that plaintiff\r\n\nhad shown  neither  a constitutionally-derived  nor a  state-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.    The  Community  Release Agreement  for  Lancaster  pre-\r\nrelease programs  requires a participating  inmate to signify\r\nhis understanding  that \"[i]n accepting and  participating in\r\ncommunity  release  programs  including  all  furloughs, work\r\nrelease,   and   education   release    opportunities,   [he]\r\nvoluntarily accept[s]  the following conditions . . . .\"  The\r\nparticipant cannot leave the state, cannot leave his assigned\r\nlocation during breaks  unless authorized to  do so, must  be\r\naware  of specific  requirements  and arrangements  for  each\r\nspecific  release  activity,  must  cooperate  with requested\r\nmedical examinations  or searches of lockers  or outside work\r\nareas, and must conduct himself generally \"in accordance with\r\nthe laws of the state and community.\"\r\n     The Agreement states that \"[a]ny violation  of community\r\nrelease  policies will  result in  [the participant's]  being\r\nsubject to disciplinary action or prosecution and will not be\r\nconsidered in the future community participation requests.\"\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ncreated  liberty interest.    This being  so, the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment  did not  require the  state to  provide procedures\r\n\nprior to removing him  from the program and returning  him to\r\n\nprison.  The district court also found no violation of the Ex\r\n\nPost  Facto  Clause,  because the  new  regulations governing\r\n\nparticipation in  work release  were not punitive  but rather\r\n\nrelated to the  public safety.   The court denied  injunctive\r\n\nrelief, as plaintiff had not shown a likelihood of success on\r\n\nthe merits.3    \r\n\nII. Standard of Review\r            II. Standard of Review\r\n\n     The  district  court  dismissed  plaintiff's  claims  in\r\n\nresponse  to  defendants'  motion   in  the  alternative  for\r\n\ndismissal under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) or Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56.    The  district  court recited  the  standard  governing\r\n\n12(b)(6)  motions  to dismiss,  but  it  relied  in  part  on\r\n\nmaterials outside  of the pleadings  (including the Agreement\r\n\nand  affidavits)  to determine  whether  plaintiff enjoyed  a\r\n\nprotected liberty  interest entitling  him to procedural  due\r\n\nprocess before  removal from  the work release  program.   We\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.   The  district court dismissed plaintiff's  pendant state\r\nlaw   claims  without   prejudice,  pursuant  to   28  U.S.C.\r\n 1367(c)(3).  While  appellant's   counsel  claimed  at  oral\r\nargument  a lack  of substantive  as well  as procedural  due\r\nprocess,  the former theory is not briefed nor does it appear\r\nto have  been developed below.   Accordingly, it  was waived.\r\nSee Grella  v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 36 (1st\r                                                    \r\nCir. 1994).     \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ntherefore  treat the motion as one for summary judgment.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nSmith v.  Massachusetts Dep't  of Correction, 936  F.2d 1390,\r                                                        \r\n\n1394 (1st Cir. 1991); Fed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  We review a\r\n\ngrant of summary judgment  de novo, viewing the facts  in the\r                                              \r\n\nlight most favorable  to the nonmovant, plaintiff.

Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\r            III. Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\r\n\n     A. The District Court Decision\r                 A. The District Court Decision\r\n\n          The  Fourteenth  Amendment provides  that  no state\r\n\nshall  \"deprive  any person  of  life,  liberty, or  property\r\n\nwithout due  process of law.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  XIV.  The\r\n\nfocal  issue  here is  whether  plaintiff was  deprived  of a\r\n\nprotected liberty interest.   Plaintiff has not asserted that\r\n\nhe  possessed  a  liberty  interest created  by  the  federal\r\n\nConstitution   itself.4    Rather,   he  has  contended  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.    The  Supreme  Court  has recognized  that,  in  certain\r\ncircumstances,  the Constitution  itself may  give rise  to a\r\nliberty interest.  See, e.g.,  Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n210,   221-222   (1990)   (involuntary    administration   of\r\nantipsychotic  drugs); Vitek  v.

See, e.g., Hewitt\r                                                                         \r\nv.

Dominique relied on cases holding that a\r\n\nliberty  interest  may be  created  by  \"explicitly mandatory\r\n\nlanguage\" within  state regulations.   See Kentucky  Dep't of\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorrections v.

They agree  with the  lower court  that the\r\n\nlanguage of the regulations and Agreement was insufficient to\r\n\ncreate  a  liberty  interest in  any  event,  but argue  that\r\n\nremoval from  work release and return  to regular confinement\r\n\ndid not meet Sandin's new threshold criterion of an \"atypical\r                               \r\n\nand significant  hardship . . . in  relation to  the ordinary\r\n\nincidents  of  prison  life.\"   Id.  at  2300.   If  solitary\r                                               \r\n\nconfinement for thirty days  did not, in Sandin, rise  to the\r                                                           \r\n\nlevel of  an  \"atypical, significant  hardship,\" then  surely\r\n\nremoval from work release does not do so, defendants say.  \r\n\n          Plaintiff  replies that Sandin is unclear about the\r                                                    \r\n\nextent  to  which  the   standard  for  recognizing   liberty\r\n\ninterests has changed.  He argues that the Due Process Clause\r\n\nstill  protects inmates  against important  deprivations, and\r\n\nthat  removal  from work  release  and transfer  to  a higher\r\n\nsecurity  prison  constitute  an  \"atypical  and  significant\r\n\nhardship.\"  \r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\n          We  have some  sympathy for  plaintiff's complaint.\r\n\nHis  removal  from a  work release  program  in which  he was\r\n\napparently  functioning well,  and his  transfer to  a medium\r\n\nsecurity facility,  may  well,  from  his  perspective,  seem\r\n\nunjust.  But  the federal courts are not authorized by law to\r\n\nsecond-guess  the  policies  of prison  administrators  in  a\r\n\ngeneral sense.    The  question assigned  to  us  is  whether\r\n\nplaintiff had a liberty interest in remaining in work release\r\n\nstatus,  such  that under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment he  was\r\n\nentitled to due process of law before that privilege could be\r\n\nrevoked.   We are  constrained to agree  with defendants that\r\n\nthe new  threshold test  articulated in Sandin  precludes our\r                                                          \r\n\nfinding a liberty interest and bars relief.6  \r\n\n     As in Sandin, the state's action here did not in any way\r                             \r\n\naffect  the duration of Dominique's state  sentence.  See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 2301-2302.   Additionally, his transfer  to a more  secure\r\n\nfacility subjected him to  conditions no different from those\r\n\nordinarily  experienced  by large  numbers  of other  inmates\r\n\nserving their sentences in customary fashion.  In Sandin, the\r                                                                    \r\n\nSupreme  Court observed  that  conditions  in the  segregated\r\n\nconfinement at issue \"mirrored  those conditions imposed upon\r\n\ninmates   in   administrative   segregation  and   protective\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Sandin  applies retroactively  to the  present  case, the\r                      \r\nSupreme Court having applied the rule  announced in Sandin to\r                                                                      \r\nthe parties in  that case.

The  Court found\r                          \r\n\nsupport in this similarity  for the proposition that \"[b]ased\r\n\non   a  comparison   between   inmates  inside   and  outside\r\n\ndisciplinary  segregation, the State's actions in placing him\r\n\nthere  for 30  days did  not work  a major disruption  in his\r\n\nenvironment.\"   Id. (footnote omitted).   Similarly here, any\r                               \r\n\nhardship  was  not \"atypical\"  in  relation  to the  ordinary\r\n\nincidents of prison life.\r\n\n          It is true that  there is a considerable difference\r\n\nbetween the freedoms  Dominique enjoyed when  he was in  work\r\n\nrelease  status  and the  conditions  of  incarceration at  a\r\n\nmedium security  facility.  To return  from the quasi-freedom\r\n\nof work  release to  the  regimentation of  life within  four\r\n\nwalls  may  be said,  relatively  speaking,  to have  been  a\r\n\n\"significant\" deprivation.   Nonetheless, confinement  within\r\n\nfour  walls of the type plaintiff now endures is an \"ordinary\r\n\nincident of prison life.\"   It is not \"atypical.\"   The Court\r\n\nhas noted  that an  inmate's subjective expectations  are not\r                                                   \r\n\ndispositive of  the liberty-interest analysis.   See id., 115\r                                                                    \r\n\nS.Ct. at 2301 n.9.\r\n\n          If Dominique's  contrary argument were  to prevail,\r\n\nwe would  open the door to  finding an \"atypical...restraint\"\r\n\nwhenever  an  inmate  is  moved   from  one  situation  to  a\r\n\nsignificantly harsher one that is, nonetheless, a commonplace\r\n\naspect of prison  existence.  For example, a liberty interest\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\ncould  be claimed if an inmate were moved into less agreeable\r\n\nsurroundings  than  his  initial  placement.    Similarly,  a\r\n\nliberty interest might be claimed whenever authorities or the\r\n\nstate  legislature  decided to  eliminate  or  cut back  work\r\n\nrelease  programs or  furloughs.   Such  changes, painful  to\r\n\nthose affected, could be  regarded under plaintiff's argument\r\n\nas implicating liberty interests even though the prisoner was\r\n\nnever placed in conditions  going beyond the customary rigors\r\n\nof  prison life.  Such an outcome, we believe, would directly\r\n\nconflict with Sandin's teachings.   Sandin's new standard was\r                                                      \r\n\nexpressly  adopted by  a majority  of  the Supreme  Court \"to\r\n\nafford  appropriate   deference  and  flexibility   to  state\r\n\nofficials trying  to manage a volatile environment.\"   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n2299.   The Court plainly intended to eliminate the basis for\r\n\nfederal due process  claims stemming from internal  transfers\r\n\nand status changes that do not result in \"atypical hardship,\"\r\n\ni.e.,  hardship beyond  the  norms of  ordinary prison  life.\r                \r\n\nHence the state's removal  of Dominique's measure of freedom,\r\n\nreplacing it  with confinement of a  sort commonly associated\r\n\nwith  ordinary prison life, did not violate anything that can\r\n\nbe termed a liberty  interest.  See Klos v.  Haskell, 48 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n81  (2d Cir.  1995)  (a  pre-Sandin  case denying  relief  on\r                                               \r\n\nstrikingly similar  facts,  cited with  apparent approval  in\r\n\nSandin, 115 S.

Prison officials, it is said,\r\n\ndo  not enter  into  agreements with  inmates concerning  the\r\n\nordinary incidents  of prison  life.   As the  district court\r\n\nfound, however, the  Agreement preserved broad decisionmaking\r\n\nauthority  of state  officials  and the  regulations did  not\r\n\nimpose any  duty  to retain  plaintiff  in the  work  release\r\n\nprogram.    And,  that  analysis aside,  withdrawal  of  work\r\n\nrelease privileges  did not  meet Sandin's threshold  test of\r                                                    \r\n\nworking a  \"significant and atypical hardship  in relation to\r\n\nthe  ordinary incidents of prison life.\"  While we may regret\r\n\nthe   disappointment   and  frustration   inherent   in  such\r\n\nwithdrawal, the hardship  was not \"atypical.\"   Cf.

While the district court did not articulate a basis\r\n\nfor  this  ineligibility  (instead  assuming  that  was  so),\r\n\nplaintiff appears  to be an  identified sex offender  who may\r\n\nnot be moved to a minimum  security facility, with associated\r\n\nprivileges,  unless  and until  he  successfully completes  a\r\n\ntreatment program,  admits his offense, and otherwise obtains\r\n\napproval  for  a transfer.    See id.      446.07, 446.08(4),\r                                                 \r\n\n446.13. \r\n\n          The district court  rejected plaintiff's claim that\r\n\nthe regulation amounted  to punishment applied  retroactively\r\n\nto  plaintiff's  offense.     The  court  reasoned  that  the\r\n\nregulation  was \"driven  by  safety concerns,  and  not by  a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nas  a  precondition  for   transfer.    It  outlines  further\r\ntransition phases and evaluation processes as well.  Transfer\r\nappears  ultimately  possible   absent  \"program   failures,\"\r\ndefined to  include inmates  who  remain in  denial of  their\r\noffense, those  who \"refuse  to participate or  minimize with\r\nregard  to their  offense(s),\"  and those  at the  non-secure\r\nfacility treatment phase who move toward relapse or otherwise\r\nbecome  \"at risk.\"    Id.    446.13.   The  regulations  also\r                                     \r\ncontain a  sex offender \"notice of  release\" provision, which\r\nis not at issue in this appeal.  See id.   446.14.\r                                                    \r\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n\ndesire  to  impose  further  punishment on  prisoners.\"    We\r\n\naffirm, again guided by a recent Supreme Court decision.9\r\n\n          The Ex  Post Facto  Clause provides that  \"No State\r\n\nshall . . . pass  any . . . ex post facto Law.\"   U.S. Const.\r\n\nart.

Plaintiff James\r                                                      \r\n\nDominique, a  sentenced  inmate in  the Massachusetts  prison\r\n\nsystem, was returned to confinement after he had been allowed\r\n\nto participate  in a  work  release program  for almost  four\r\n\nyears.  He appeals from the district court's refusal to order\r\n\nreinstatement of his work release status and its dismissal of\r\n\nhis related claims,  brought under 42 U.S.C.   1983, alleging\r\n\nviolations  of  the  Due  Process Clause  of  the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment  and the Ex Post  Facto Clause.   We affirm, albeit\r\n\nfor  different  reasons  in  light of  recent  Supreme  Court\r\n\ndecisions.\r\n\nI. Facts\r            I. Facts\r\n\n          Plaintiff  was  imprisoned  in  1983  for  multiple\r\n\ncrimes including incest and is scheduled for release  in June\r\n\n2000.   In  August 1987,  he was  transferred to  the minimum\r\n\nsecurity Massachusetts Correctional Institution  at Lancaster\r\n\n(\"MCI-Lancaster\").   In May 1988, the  Superintendent of MCI-\r\n\nLancaster  permitted him  to  renew his  driver's license  in\r\n\nconnection with work he was then doing on state vehicles.  In\r\n\nAugust 1990,  plaintiff was  approved for the  Community Work\r\n\nRelease   Program.     He  became   a  mechanic   for  R.M.J.\r\n\nTransportation, Inc., and the following year was permitted to\r\n\nopen his own vehicle repair business.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Plaintiff  remained  in good  standing in  the work\r\n\nrelease program.  However,  in the summer of 1993,  access to\r\n\nhis license and the keys to his personal vehicle was revoked,\r\n\ncausing him to  lose his job  at R.M.J. Transportation.    In\r\n\nApril  of 1994, he was removed from the work release program.\r\n\nOn May 5, 1994, because he was deemed a security risk, he was\r\n\ntransferred from MCI-Lancaster to a medium security facility,\r\n\nMCI-Shirley.  No hearing occurred before the latter transfer,\r\n\nbut reclassification hearings were subsequently held  on June\r\n\n13 and September 23,  1994.  Each time, a  committee majority\r\n\nrecommended   plaintiff's  transfer   to  a   lower  security\r\n\nfacility.  The  Commissioner overruled these recommendations.\r\n\nPlaintiff remains at MCI-Shirley.\r\n\n          Defendants1  say  that  they   revoked  plaintiff's\r\n\nprivileges  because he  remains  in denial  of his  crime (in\r\n\nparticular,  the  incest),  and  because he  had  too  little\r\n\naccountability at  his repair business.   They justify taking\r\n\naway  plaintiff's license  because of revised  DOC guidelines\r\n\nproviding that only inmates within six  months of an approved\r\n\nrelease  date are eligible to  use their licenses.   They add\r\n\nthat his  crime makes him  a risk to  the public safety,  and\r\n\nthat,  having been  denied parole on  three occasions,  he is\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.     The   defendants   are  William   Weld,   Governor  of\r\nMassachusetts,  Thomas  Rapone,   then-Commissioner  of   the\r\nDepartment of Public Safety, Larry E. Dubois, Commissioner of\r\nthe Massachusetts Department of Correction, and Luis Spencer,\r\nSuperintendent of MCI-Lancaster.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nmore likely to attempt to escape.  Plaintiff responds that he\r\n\nhas  never violated  any condition  of the  Community Release\r\n\nAgreement  (\"Agreement\").2    He  claims  that  his   removal\r\n\nresulted from media and public uproar following an incident -\r\n\n-  wholly  unrelated to  him  --  in which  an  MCI-Lancaster\r\n\nescapee shot a police  officer.  Plaintiff was never  given a\r\n\nwritten  statement   of  reasons   for  his  removal.     New\r\n\nregulations concerning the  treatment of  sex offenders  make\r\n\nplaintiff presently ineligible for work release.\r\n\n          In  his  district court  action,  plaintiff alleged\r\n\nthat these  changes in  his status violated  the Due  Process\r\n\nClause  of the  Fourteenth Amendment  and the  Ex Post  Facto\r\n\nClause.  He requested  a preliminary injunction ordering that\r\n\nhe  be reinstated to the work release program.  In dismissing\r\n\nthe due process claim, the district court held that plaintiff\r\n\nhad shown  neither  a constitutionally-derived  nor a  state-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.    The  Community  Release Agreement  for  Lancaster  pre-\r\nrelease programs  requires a participating  inmate to signify\r\nhis understanding  that \"[i]n accepting and  participating in\r\ncommunity  release  programs  including  all  furloughs, work\r\nrelease,   and   education   release    opportunities,   [he]\r\nvoluntarily accept[s]  the following conditions . . . .\"  The\r\nparticipant cannot leave the state, cannot leave his assigned\r\nlocation during breaks  unless authorized to  do so, must  be\r\naware  of specific  requirements  and arrangements  for  each\r\nspecific  release  activity,  must  cooperate  with requested\r\nmedical examinations  or searches of lockers  or outside work\r\nareas, and must conduct himself generally \"in accordance with\r\nthe laws of the state and community.\"\r\n     The Agreement states that \"[a]ny violation  of community\r\nrelease  policies will  result in  [the participant's]  being\r\nsubject to disciplinary action or prosecution and will not be\r\nconsidered in the future community participation requests.\"\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ncreated  liberty interest.    This being  so, the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment  did not  require the  state to  provide procedures\r\n\nprior to removing him  from the program and returning  him to\r\n\nprison.  The district court also found no violation of the Ex\r\n\nPost  Facto  Clause,  because the  new  regulations governing\r\n\nparticipation in  work release  were not punitive  but rather\r\n\nrelated to the  public safety.   The court denied  injunctive\r\n\nrelief, as plaintiff had not shown a likelihood of success on\r\n\nthe merits.3    \r\n\nII. Standard of Review\r            II. Standard of Review\r\n\n     The  district  court  dismissed  plaintiff's  claims  in\r\n\nresponse  to  defendants'  motion   in  the  alternative  for\r\n\ndismissal under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) or Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56.    The  district  court recited  the  standard  governing\r\n\n12(b)(6)  motions  to dismiss,  but  it  relied  in  part  on\r\n\nmaterials outside  of the pleadings  (including the Agreement\r\n\nand  affidavits)  to determine  whether  plaintiff enjoyed  a\r\n\nprotected liberty  interest entitling  him to procedural  due\r\n\nprocess before  removal from  the work release  program.   We\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.   The  district court dismissed plaintiff's  pendant state\r\nlaw   claims  without   prejudice,  pursuant  to   28  U.S.C.\r\n 1367(c)(3).  While  appellant's   counsel  claimed  at  oral\r\nargument  a lack  of substantive  as well  as procedural  due\r\nprocess,  the former theory is not briefed nor does it appear\r\nto have  been developed below.   Accordingly, it  was waived.\r\nSee Grella  v. Salem Five Cent Sav.

The District Court Decision\r\n\n          The  Fourteenth  Amendment provides  that  no state\r\n\nshall  \"deprive  any person  of  life,  liberty, or  property\r\n\nwithout due  process of law.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  XIV.  The\r\n\nfocal  issue  here is  whether  plaintiff was  deprived  of a\r\n\nprotected liberty interest.   Plaintiff has not asserted that\r\n\nhe  possessed  a  liberty  interest created  by  the  federal\r\n\nConstitution   itself.4    Rather,   he  has  contended  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.

For example, a liberty interest\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\ncould  be claimed if an inmate were moved into less agreeable\r\n\nsurroundings  than  his  initial  placement.    Similarly,  a\r\n\nliberty interest might be claimed whenever authorities or the\r\n\nstate  legislature  decided to  eliminate  or  cut back  work\r\n\nrelease  programs or  furloughs.
