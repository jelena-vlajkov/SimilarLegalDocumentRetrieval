The Pyles were\r\n\neach  excluded from  the School  at one  time or  another for\r\n\nwearing  tee-shirts  emblazoned with  messages  its officials\r\n\ndeemed  in violation of its  dress code.

We vacate the court's ruling  on the state law,\r\n\nand  on  our own  motion  certify  a question  regarding  its\r\n\ninterpretation   to   the    Supreme   Judicial   Court    of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          The court's findings of  fact amply illustrate  the\r\n\ntrajectory of the tee-shirt turmoil; we simply summarize.\r\n\n          All began  on March  24, 1993,  when a gym  teacher\r\n\nobjected  to a shirt  Jeffrey wore  to her  class trumpeting,\r\n\n\"Coed Naked Band:  Do It To The Rhythm.\"  This set  in motion\r\n\na series of face-offs between Jeffrey,  backed by his father,\r\n\nChristopher  Pyle, a  college teacher of  constitutional law,\r\n\nlater  joined by  his younger  brother Jonathan,  and various\r\n\nschool officials over the  exercise and permissible extent of\r\n\nthe School's authority to  regulate student attire in school.\r\n\nTwice  Jeffrey requested  that  the School  formally draft  a\r\n\ndress  code because  the  informal system  that had  operated\r\n\nuntil then was, in  his opinion, too vague.  When  it finally\r\n\nrelented and  issued a code containing the provision at issue\r\n\nhere,  the Pyles  signalled  their opposition  by sporting  a\r\n\nseries  of  shirts  emblazoned  with   messages  deliberately\r\n\ncalibrated  to test  the  mettle and  sweep  of the  School's\r\n\nenforcement authority.  Shirts were banned, then unbanned, as\r\n\nthe School  struggled to implement  its new dress  code under\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Manifestly if the statute  does not disempower the School\r\nwe shall have to consider the First Amendment.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthe Pyles' assault.   Ultimately, only  the Coed Naked  shirt\r\n\nthat  originally sparked the conflict, and one other, worn by\r\n\nJonathan  (\"See Dick  Drink. See  Dick Drive.  See Dick  Die.\r\n\nDon't Be A Dick.\"), were banned under the new policy.\r\n\n     II.  Public School Students' Freedom of Expression \r                 II.  Public School Students' Freedom of Expression \r                                                                    \r\n\n                   Under Massachusetts Law\r                               Under Massachusetts Law\r                                                      \r\n\n          In 1974 Massachusetts enacted a statute that reads,\r\n\nin pertinent part:\r\n\n               The right of  students to freedom of\r\n          expression  in the public  schools of the\r\n          commonwealth   shall  not   be  abridged,\r\n          provided that such  right shall not cause\r\n          any  disruption  or  disorder within  the\r\n          school.    Freedom  of  expression  shall\r\n          include  without  limitation, the  rights\r\n          and    responsibilities   of    students,\r\n          collectively  and  individually,  (a)  to\r\n          express  their  views through  speech and\r\n          symbols,  (b)  to   write,  publish   and\r\n          disseminate their views, (c)  to assemble\r\n          peaceably  on  school  property  for  the\r\n          purpose      of     expressing      their\r\n          opinions. . . .\r\n\nM.G.L. c. 71,   82.3   The statute was originally  applicable\r\n\nonly to those cities and towns which chose to accept it,  but\r\n\nbecame mandatory throughout the  State in 1988.   St.1988, c.\r\n\n137, M.G.L. c. 71,   86, as amended.\r\n\n          There   is   no   Massachusetts    decisional   law\r\n\ninterpreting  section 82.    If,  as  the Pyles  contend,  it\r\n\ncreates a broad student right  to exhibit messages subject to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The statute also exempts  the school and school officials\r\nfrom criminal and civil liability for student expression.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nrestriction only for  obscenity, defamation, fighting  words,\r\n\nincitement  and disruption,  we need  not reach  the question\r\n\nwhether  the First Amendment does so.  There is no contention\r\n\nthat  the  tee-shirts  fell  into  any  of  these  concededly\r\n\nprohibitable categories, so we  start with a routine question\r\n\nof  statutory interpretation.    We do  not  find the  answer\r\n\naltogether clear.\r\n\n          On  the sole basis of a press release issued by the\r\n\nlegislator who  sponsored  the 1988  amendment, the  district\r\n\ncourt read the statute to \"require[] that  'school-sponsored'\r\n\nspeech,  such as articles in student-run newspapers, . . . be\r\n\njudged by  the same  standard as 'school-tolerated'  speech,\"\r\n\nbut to have \"no relevance  . . . to the analysis of  a school\r\n\nadministrator's   efforts  to   curb  vulgarity   and  sexual\r\n\ninnuendo.\" 861 F. Supp. at 168.  Its conclusion, 861 F. Supp.\r\n\nat 167, that the  statute was \"aimed at\" the  Supreme Court's\r\n\ndecision in Hazelwood School  District v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n260 (1988) (holding public  school officials may regulate the\r\n\ncontent  of   school  newspapers,  plays  and  other  \"school\r\n\nsponsored expressive activities\"), presumably meant  aimed at\r\n\nthe Hazelwood  principle, as the statute  preceded the actual\r                         \r\n\ndecision by fourteen years.  However, neither the statute nor\r\n\nthe amendment rendering it mandatory mentions  anything about\r\n\n\"school-sponsored\" or  \"school-tolerated\" speech.   We do not\r\n\nconsider the press  sheet of a former high school journalist,\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nissued fourteen years after the original statute was written,\r\n\nto  offer  adequate  interpretive  guidance.   Nor  does  any\r\n\nlegislative history  provide a basis  for the court  to build\r\n\nclauses  into  the  statute.    On  its  face,  the   statute\r\n\nguarantees  students'  freedom  of expression  \"shall  not be\r\n\nabridged\" except  insofar as  it \"cause[s] any  disruption or\r\n\ndisorder within the school.\"   M.G.L. c. 71,   82.   Students\r\n\nmay  \"express  their  views  through   speech  and  symbols,\"\r\n\npresumably  including a stance  against drinking and driving,\r\n\n\"without limitation.\"  Id.\r                                      \r\n\n          It is difficult to think of at least the \"See Dick\"\r\n\nshirt, though reasonably thought  vulgar, as not expressing a\r\n\n\"view.\"   At  the same time,  our difficulty  with proceeding\r\n\nalong this  straightforward route is  that it puts  a federal\r\n\ncourt  in  the  awkward  position  of  issuing  this  binding\r\n\ninterpretation ahead of any state tribunal where, despite the\r\n\napparent   language,   it   is   quite   possible   that  the\r\n\nMassachusetts legislature never considered licensing students\r\n\nto use vulgarity at will in the public schools, and depriving\r\n\nschool  officials of  all authority  to  regulate it  if non-\r\n\ndisruptive.   Nor  is  it easy  to  read into  the  statute a\r\n\nblanket prohibition against a school's suppressing vulgarity.\r\n\nIn the absence of any state court interpretation, we would be\r\n\nin  the  position of  dictating  state-wide  policy to  local\r\n\nschool officials at the behest of two students.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n                     III.

There is no contention that the tee-shirts fell into any of these concededly prohibitable categories, so we start with a routine question of statutory interpretation.

Its conclusion, 861 F.Supp. at 167, that the statute was \"aimed at\" the Supreme Court's decision in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988) (holding public school officials may regulate the content of school newspapers, plays and other \"school sponsored expressive activities\"), presumably meant aimed at the Hazelwood principle, as the statute preceded the actual decision by fourteen years.  However, neither the statute nor the amendment rendering it mandatory mentions anything about \"school-sponsored\" or \"school-tolerated\" speech.  We do not consider the press sheet of a former high school journalist, issued fourteen years after the original statute was written, to offer adequate interpretive guidance.  Nor does any legislative history provide a basis for the court to build clauses into the statute.

Nor is it easy to read into the statute a blanket prohibition against a school's suppressing vulgarity.

Twice Jeffrey requested that the School formally draft a dress code because the informal system that had operated until then was, in his opinion, too vague.  When it finally relented and issued a code containing the provision at issue here, the Pyles signalled their opposition by sporting a series of shirts emblazoned with messages deliberately calibrated to test the mettle and sweep of the School's enforcement authority.  Shirts were banned, then unbanned, as the School struggled to implement its new dress code under the Pyles' assault.  Ultimately, only the Coed Naked shirt that originally sparked the conflict, and one other, worn by Jonathan (\"See Dick Drink.  See Dick Drive.  See Dick Die.
