In one corner, the plaintiff,  a\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\ngovernment agency, having won  by a knockout in the  court below,\n\nasserts that this is a case about defendants who demand their own\n\ntimetable for  pretrial discovery  and motion  practice.  In  the\n\nother corner, a group of defendants, having been laid low by what\n\nthey claim was  a rabbit punch, assert that this  is a case about\n\nthe  government flouting  court-imposed deadlines  and procedural\n\nrules.    After  reconstructing  the  chronology  of  events,  we\n\nconclude that the defendants are  substantially correct.  We also\n\nconclude that the  district court, instead  of hurrying to  grant\n\nsummary judgment, should have held the government accountable for\n\nthe  lack  of  punctual  discovery  and  given  the  government's\n\nlitigation  adversaries  a fair  opportunity  to formulate  their\n\nopposition.\n\nI.  THE VIEW FROM RINGSIDE\n\n          At  the height  of a  boom market  in real  estate, two\n\nneophytes,  Ralph H. Scott, II, a physician, and his wife, Betty,\n\ndecided to  build a  large, expensive residential  subdivision on\n\nthe  picturesque  island  of  Martha's  Vineyard.    In  order to\n\nproceed, Dr.  and Mrs. Scott  formed a corporation,  North Bridge\n\nAssociates,  Inc.    The   Scotts  and  North  Bridge  Associates\n\n(collectively, \"borrowers\" or \"appellants\")  then executed a note\n\nin favor of  ComFed Savings Bank (\"ComFed\" or  \"the bank\") in the\n\namount  of $2,995,000.  The borrowers closed the loan on November\n\n25,  1987,  securing  it  by  a  mortgage  on  the  North  Bridge\n\nsubdivision.   They also  executed a construction  loan agreement\n\n                                3\n\nthat  specified when and how the bank would disburse the borrowed\n\nfunds.\n\n          The   venture   experienced   several  setbacks.      A\n\nparticularly vexing problem involved abutting property owners who\n\neventually  served a  lis  pendens asserting  that title  defects\n                                  \n\ninvalidated easements  essential to the  subdivision's viability.\n\nAt this  delicate juncture, the bank  shut off the  flow of funds\n\nand  construction ground  to a  halt.   When the  promissory note\n\nmatured on November 25,  1988, the borrowers failed to  repay the\n\noutstanding   balance.     In  a   last-ditch  effort   to  avert\n\nforeclosure, they  capitulated to ComFed's  demands.  As  part of\n\nthe  tribute  that ComFed  exacted  for  deferring the  repayment\n\nobligation, the  borrowers  signed  an  extension  agreement  and\n\ngeneral  release   surrendering   all  potential   defenses   and\n\ncounterclaims.1\n\n          The loan remained  unpaid at the  end of the  extension\n\nperiod.   The  bank then  sued the  borrowers in  a Massachusetts\n\nstate court.  The borrowers answered and counterclaimed alleging,\n\ninter alia,  that ComFed  had  broken its  promises, violated  an\n          \n\nimplied  covenant of  good  faith and  fair dealing,  disregarded\n\nfiduciary   responsibilities,   and    engaged   in    fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation.   They also asked  the court to  set aside the\n\n                    \n\n     1In  the extension agreement, the borrowers represented that\n\"no defenses, offsets, or counterclaims exist to the full payment\nof  such  indebtedness in  accordance with  its  terms.\"   In the\ngeneral release, they purposed  to discharge ComFed \"of  and from\nany  and all  debts,  demands, action,  causes of  action, suits,\naccounts, covenants,  and damages which  North Bridge Associates,\nInc. or its officers . . . may have or ever had . . . .\"\n\n                                4\n\nextension agreement and general release on grounds of duress.\n\n          Inasmuch  as  procedural  tussles  have  dominated  the\n\ncourse  of this litigation,  we deem  it prudent  to set  forth a\n\ndetailed chronology  of relevant events occurring  from and after\n\nthe  time  that the  parties  joined  issue.    In doing  so,  we\n\neliminate  many  matters unimportant  to  our  resolution of  the\n\nissues on appeal.2\n\n          1.   December 20, 1990.   The borrowers serve\n          1.   December 20, 1990.\n          interrogatories  and  a request  for document\n          production.    In compliance  with applicable\n          procedural  rules, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b),\n                                \n          the request sets a reasonable  time and place\n          for production, specifying that the documents\n          shall  be  produced  within  30  days at  the\n          offices of the borrowers' lawyers.\n\n          2.   January  23, 1991.   Following  ComFed's\n          2.   January  23, 1991.\n          failure,  the  Resolution  Trust  Corporation\n          (\"RTC\"), having been appointed as conservator\n          (and  soon  to  be  appointed  receiver),  is\n          substituted  as the  party plaintiff  and, on\n          April  1, 1991,  removes  the  action to  the\n          federal district court.\n\n          3.  April 16, 1991.  Over three  months after\n          3.  April 16, 1991.\n\n                    \n\n     2At the  time the  borrowers initiated discovery,  the state\ncourt had  jurisdiction and, accordingly, the  borrowers' initial\ndiscovery requests  were governed when made  by the Massachusetts\nRules  of Civil Procedure.   The action  was soon  removed to the\nfederal  district court.  See  Chronology, infra, at  No.2.  This\n                                                \nprocedural wrinkle has  no effect on  our ensuing discussion  for\ntwo  reasons.   First, removed  cases are  governed fully  by the\nFederal  Rules, and are treated  no differently than  if they had\noriginated in  a federal forum.   See Fed. R. Civ.  P. 81(c); see\n                                                                 \nalso Granny  Goose Foods, Inc.  v. Brotherhood of  Teamsters, 415\n                                                            \nU.S. 423,  438  (1974).   Second,  the state's  procedural  rules\nparallel   their   federal   counterparts   in   their   relevant\nparticulars.  See, e.g.,  Mass. R. Civ. P. 34(b)  (directing that\n                       \nrequests  for  document  production \"specify  a  reasonable time,\nplace, and manner  of making  the inspection  and performing  the\nrelated  acts\"); Mass. R. Civ. P. 33(a) (allotting 45 days within\nwhich to answer interrogatories).  For simplicity's sake, we cite\nonly to the Federal Rules.\n\n                                5\n\n          the date on  which the plaintiff's  discovery\n          responses  were  due,   RTC  takes  a  first,\n          tentative step toward responding:   it offers\n          to  produce  the  described   documents,  but\n          attempts unilaterally  to amend the  time and\n          place  for  production.    No  documents  are\n          received and nothing is said with  respect to\n          the  answers   to  interrogatories  although,\n          under the Federal Rules, the answers were due\n          within 30  days of service, see  Fed. R. Civ.\n                                         \n          P. 33(b)(3).\n\n          4.  May 26, 1992.  After thirteen more months\n          4.  May 26, 1992.\n          without  incident or action  of any kind, the\n          district  judge  holds  a status  conference.\n          RTC   agrees   to  provide   all  outstanding\n          discovery \"promptly.\"\n\n          5.   February  22, 1993.   RTC  fritters away\n          5.   February  22, 1993.\n          another nine  months.  Eventually,  the judge\n          convenes  a second  status conference.   This\n          time,  RTC  comes  armed with  a  motion  for\n          partial summary  judgment (\"the SJM\").3   The\n          judge   orders   all  outstanding   discovery\n          obligations  honored  by  March  24,  at  the\n          latest.\n\n          6.  March 2,  1993.  As no progress  has been\n          6.  March 2,  1993.\n          made  toward  completion  of  discovery,  the\n          borrowers file the first of three motions for\n          enlargement  of  the  time  within  which  to\n          oppose the  SJM.   The  borrowers' motion  is\n          accompanied   by   an  attorney's   affidavit\n          detailing  the  history  of  the  action  and\n          noting  that, more than  two years after they\n          should   have   been   delivered,   discovery\n          materials are still in the pipeline.\n\n          7.    March  18,  1993.    RTC  notifies  the\n          7.    March  18,  1993.\n          borrowers   that   it   has   gathered   some\n          responsive documents, and  suggests that  the\n          parties agree upon a mutually convenient time\n          to review them.\n\n          8.   March 25,  1993.  Over  RTC's objection,\n          8.   March 25,  1993.\n\n                    \n\n     3The SJM addressed  only count  1 of the  complaint and  the\nborrowers'   several  counterclaims.     The  remainder   of  the\ncomplaint,  dealing principally  with RTC's  effort to  reach and\napply  assets standing  in  the name  of  a related  third  party\n(himself a defendant), remains pending in the district court.\n\n                                6\n\n          the  district  court  grants  the  borrowers'\n          motion and extends the time for opposing  the\n          SJM to April 16, 1993.\n\n          9.   April 2, 1993.   The interrogatories are\n          9.   April 2, 1993.\n          finally answered and, on  the same date,  the\n          borrowers'  attorneys  review  the  documents\n          that RTC has made  available at its counsel's\n          offices.\n\n          10.   April 9, 1993.   Some of  the documents\n          10.   April 9, 1993.\n          originally  requested  on  December 2,  1990,\n          amounting to  over 2,000  pages, are at  long\n          last   delivered  to   the  offices   of  the\n          borrowers'  lawyers,  Peter and  Cathy Brooks\n          (who are husband and wife).  On the same day,\n          however,   the   Brooks'   infant    son   is\n          hospitalized and placed in an  intensive care\n          unit.  He remains there,  initially, for nine\n          days, and is readmitted  on April 20.    Upon\n          discharge  three days later,  he continues to\n          require special attention.\n\n          11.   April 12,  1993.  The  borrowers file a\n          11.   April 12,  1993.\n          motion   in  which  they  request  a  further\n          enlargement of time until May 14, 1993.  This\n          motion  is not  accompanied by  an affidavit,\n          but,  in  an  accompanying memorandum,  Peter\n          Brooks (who authored the affidavit in support\n          of the first extension motion)  describes the\n          medical  emergency and informs the court that\n          the  borrowers  cannot intelligently  address\n          the SJM  until they  have time to  review the\n          compendious discovery materials produced only\n          a few days earlier.\n\n          12.   May 20,  1993.  The  borrowers conclude\n          12.   May 20,  1993.\n          their document review  and find the documents\n          produced  to  be  incomplete and  inadequate.\n          They  write  to   RTC's  counsel   specifying\n          seventeen missing categories of documents and\n          soliciting  a conference  to reduce  areas of\n          potential   controversy.4       The   ensuing\n\n                    \n\n     4The  letter  implicates  a  local  rule  that  provides  in\npertinent part:\n\n          Before filing any discovery motion, including\n          any motion  for sanctions . .  ., counsel for\n          each  of the  parties  shall confer  in  good\n          faith to narrow the  areas of disagreement to\n\n                                7\n\n          discussion between the  parties engenders  no\n          results.\n\n          13.  May 24, 1993.   The borrowers file their\n          13.  May 24, 1993.\n          third motion for an extension, accompanied by\n          an affidavit from Cathy Brooks rehearsing the\n          latest developments, stating her  belief that\n          the  documents  withheld  exist, and  opining\n          that   those   papers,   if  produced,   will\n          illuminate   genuine   disputes    concerning\n          material facts.\n\n          14.  June  15, 1993.   The borrowers move  to\n          14.  June  15, 1993.\n          compel   production    of   the   undisclosed\n          documents.\n\n          15.  July 20, 1993.  Without giving notice or\n          15.  July 20, 1993.\n          holding a hearing, the district  judge grants\n          the  SJM, rejects  the borrowers'  second and\n          third  extension  motions,  and   denies  the\n          motion  to  compel.    The  court  offers  no\n          meaningful   explanation   for  any   of  its\n          rulings.   In due course,  the court  invokes\n          Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) and enters judgment.\n\n          The  borrowers appeal.5    They assert  that the  lower\n\ncourt  erred:    in  denying  their  second  and  third extension\n\nmotions;  in   taking  up   the  SJM  while   discovery  remained\n\nincomplete,  and  without  prior  notice  or  a  hearing; and  in\n\ngranting the  SJM  despite  the presence  of  genuine  issues  of\n\nmaterial fact.\n\nII.  THE RULE 56(f) PARADIGM\n\n          When  a  party claims  an  inability to  respond  to an\n\n                    \n\n          the greatest  possible extent.   It shall  be\n          the responsibility of counsel for  the moving\n          party to arrange for the conference. . . .\n\nD. Mass. Loc. R. 37.1.\n\n     5For  technical reasons  related  primarily  to an  abortive\neffort to secure reconsideration, the borrowers filed two notices\nof appeal.  We need not distinguish between them.\n\n                                8\n\nopponent's   summary  judgment   motion  because   of  incomplete\n\ndiscovery or the like, Fed.  R. Civ. P. 56(f) looms large.6   Our\n\nfirst task, therefore, is to erect the framework under which Rule\n\n56(f)  motions must  be  analyzed.   We  then proceed  to  a more\n\nparticularized  discussion  of  the  borrowers'  motions  and the\n\nrulings with  respect thereto.   In performing this  analysis, we\n\nremain mindful that  a district  court's denial of  a Rule  56(f)\n\nmotion is reviewed  only for abuse of discretion.   See Licari v.\n                                                              \n\nFerruzzi,      F.3d    ,      (1st Cir. 1994)  [No. 93-2047, slip\n        \n\nop.  at 16]; Nestor Colon  Medina &amp; Sucesores,  Inc. v.

The Applicable Framework.\n                                              \n\n          Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) describes a method of buying time\n\nfor  a party who, when  confronted by a  summary judgment motion,\n\ncan  demonstrate an authentic need for, and an entitlement to, an\n\nadditional interval in which to marshal  facts essential to mount\n\nan  opposition.   See Paterson-Leitch  Co. v.  Massachusetts Mun.\n                                                                 \n\nWholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir. 1988).  The rule\n                   \n\n                    \n\n     6The rule reads:\n\n          Should  it appear  from the  affidavits  of a\n          party  opposing  the   motion  [for   summary\n          judgment] that the  party cannot for  reasons\n          stated present by  affidavit facts  essential\n          to justify the party's opposition,  the court\n          may  refuse the  application for  judgment or\n          may order a  continuance to permit affidavits\n          to be obtained or  depositions to be taken or\n          discovery to  be had  or may make  such other\n          order as is just.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\n                                9\n\nis  intended to  safeguard  against judges  swinging the  summary\n\njudgment axe too hastily.  See Price v. General Motors Corp., 931\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 162, 164 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Consistent with the  salutary purposes underlying  Rule\n\n56(f), district  courts should  construe motions that  invoke the\n\nrule generously, holding parties to the rule's spirit rather than\n\nits letter.   See  United  States v.  One  Lot of  U.S.  Currency\n                                                                 \n\n($68,000),  927  F.2d  30,  33-34  (1st  Cir.  1991);  Hebert  v.\n                                                             \n\nWicklund, 744 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1984).  This does not mean,\n        \n\nhowever,  that Rule  56(f) has  no bite  or that  its prophylaxis\n\nextends to litigants who act lackadaisically; use of the rule not\n\nonly  requires meeting  several benchmarks,  see infra,  but also\n                                                      \n\nrequires  due diligence  both  in pursuing  discovery before  the\n\nsummary judgment initiative surfaces and in pursuing an extension\n\nof  time thereafter.  In  other words, Rule  56(f) is designed to\n\nminister  to  the  vigilant,  not  to   those  who  slumber  upon\n\nperceptible rights.  See Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 989.\n                                        \n\n          Having traced the anatomy of the rule, we next add some\n\nflesh to the bones.  A litigant who desires to  invoke Rule 56(f)\n\nmust  make  a sufficient  proffer.   In  all events,  the proffer\n\nshould be  authoritative;  it  should  be advanced  in  a  timely\n\nmanner; and it should  explain why the party is  unable currently\n\nto  adduce the facts essential to opposing summary judgment.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid. at 988.   When, as is often the  case, the reason relates  to\n   \n\nincomplete discovery, the party's explanation must take a special\n\nform:    it  should show  good  cause  for  the failure  to  have\n\n                                10\n\ndiscovered the  facts sooner;  it  should set  forth a  plausible\n\nbasis  for   believing  that  specified  facts,   susceptible  of\n\ncollection within a reasonable time frame, probably exist; and it\n\nshould  indicate  how  the   emergent  facts,  if  adduced,  will\n\ninfluence  the outcome  of the  pending summary  judgment motion.\n\nSee id.\n       \n\n          In  the \"delayed  discovery\"  type of  case, then,  the\n\ncriterion  for Rule 56(f) relief  can be thought  of as embodying\n\nfive  requirements:   authoritativeness, timeliness,  good cause,\n\nutility,  and  materiality.    We have  acknowledged  that  these\n\nrequirements  are not  inflexible  and that  district courts  are\n\nvested with considerable discretion in their administration.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid. at 989.   In the exercise of that discretion,  one or more of\n   \n\nthe  requirements may be relaxed, or even excused, to address the\n\nexigencies  of  a given  case.   When  all five  requirements are\n\nsatisfied,  however,  a strong  presumption  arises  in favor  of\n\nrelief.   See Anderson v. Liberty  Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250\n                                              \n\nn.5 (1986) (stating that summary judgment will be forestalled if,\n\nand to  the extent  that, the  nonmoving party  \"has not  had the\n\nopportunity  to discover  information  that is  essential to  his\n\nopposition\").   Unless the movant has been dilatory, or the court\n\nreasonably concludes that the  motion is a stalling tactic  or an\n\nexercise  in futility,  it should  be treated  liberally.   See 6\n                                                               \n\nMoore's Federal Practice   56.24, at 797-800 (2d ed. 1993). \n                        \n\n                          B.  Analysis.\n                                      \n\n          The  main  battleground  between  the  parties  is  the\n\n                                11\n\nborrowers' third, and final, Rule 56(f) motion,7 which rested  on\n\na  claim of delayed discovery  still outstanding.   We proceed to\n\ntest this motion in the crucible of Rule 56(f).\n\n          1.   Authoritativeness.   Appellants  accompanied their\n          1.   Authoritativeness.\n                                \n\nmotion with an affidavit  executed by Cathy Brooks.   Reading the\n\nrule literally  and the case law carelessly, RTC asseverates that\n\nthe  affidavit is  defective because  it is  made by  an attorney\n\nrather than a party.  This asseveration stems from misreading one\n\ncase, Hebert, 744  F.2d at 221  (a case that,  contrary to  RTC's\n            \n\nrendition  of  it,  stands  only  for  the  proposition  that  an\n\nundocketed  letter from a lawyer  is not a  sufficient Rule 56(f)\n\nproffer), and  from ignoring  a later case,  Paterson-Leitch, 840\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 988 (a case in which we stated unequivocally  that a Rule\n\n56(f)  proffer   may  acceptably   take  the  form   of  \"written\n\nrepresentations of counsel subject  to the strictures of Fed.  R.\n\nCiv. P. 11\").\n\n          This  case  floats comfortably  within the  safe harbor\n\ncontemplated by the  Paterson-Leitch court.  The  affidavit is of\n                                    \n\nrecord and has  been duly served  on the opposing  party.  It  is\n\nsigned by a person  who possesses firsthand knowledge and  who is\n\ncompetent to address the specifics of the matters discussed.  The\n\n                    \n\n     7The second  extension motion sought  a continuance  through\nMay  14,  1993,  necessitated  by  a  medical   emergency.    See\n                                                                 \nChronology, supra,  at No. 11.  While that motion appears to have\n                 \nbeen meritorious  in the sense  that a documented  family illness\nprecluded  the borrowers  from  \"presenting  facts  essential  to\njustify [their] opposition,\" Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(f), the district\ncourt  did not consider the motion in an expeditious fashion, and\nit was effectively  superseded by  the third motion.   Hence,  we\ntrain our sights on the latter target.\n\n                                12\n\nfact  that the affiant is  also the borrowers'  attorney does not\n\nundermine the proffer; after  all, the borrowers themselves would\n\nknow the relevant  particulars only  through communications  from\n\ncounsel.   Since they could  hardly speak either  to the cause or\n\nthe  effect of  discovery delays,  requiring that  the supporting\n\naffidavit  be  signed  by them  rather  than  by  a lawyer  would\n\nmindlessly exalt form over substance.  Attorney Brooks' affidavit\n\nis, therefore, sufficiently authoritative.\n\n          2.  Timeliness.   RTC questions whether  the Rule 56(f)\n          2.  Timeliness.\n                        \n\nmotion  was filed  in a  timely  manner.   We  answer this  query\n\naffirmatively.  There  is no fixed time  limit for filing a  Rule\n\n56(f)  motion; that is, neither  the Federal Rules  nor the local\n\nrules  place any relevant restriction on the submission of such a\n\nmotion, at  least when the court has not assigned a firm date for\n\na hearing  on, or adjudication  of, the opposing  party's summary\n\njudgment initiative.8\n\n          In the  absence of  an applicable time  limit, we  hold\n\nthat  a party  must invoke  Rule 56(f)  within a  reasonable time\n\nfollowing receipt of a motion for summary judgment.  It is, after\n\nall, black  letter law that  when a  rule requires an  act to  be\n\ndone, and does  not specify a time for doing it, courts generally\n\n                    \n\n     8The only deadline  that arguably might apply  arises out of\nthe  requirement that  affidavits opposing  a motion  for summary\njudgment  must be submitted at least one day before the scheduled\nhearing  on the  motion.   See Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 56(c);  see also\n                                                                 \nAshton-Tate Corp. v. Ross,  916 F.2d 516, 519-20 (9th  Cir. 1990)\n                         \n(discussing interface between Rules  56(c) and 56(f)).   But that\nproviso has no application  where, as here, a motion  for summary\njudgment is  decided  on the  papers,  without oral  argument  or\nnotice from the court of a cutoff date.\n\n                                13\n\nimply  an obligation  to  perform  the  act within  a  reasonable\n\nperiod.    Under  this  rubric,  courts  regularly  have  grafted\n\n\"reasonable  time\"  requirements  onto otherwise  silent  federal\n\nprocedural rules in both  the criminal and civil contexts.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Government of Virgin  Islands v. Knight, 989 F.2d  619, 627\n                                             \n\n(3d  Cir.) (collecting  examples), cert.  denied, 114 S.

R.\n\nCiv.  P. 54(d)); Brittain v.  Stroh Brewery Co.,  136 F.R.D. 408,\n                                               \n\n413  (M.D.N.C. 1991)  (same,  anent motion  for protective  order\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c));  Titus v. Smith, 51 F.R.D. 224, 226\n                                             \n\n(E.D. Pa. 1970) (imposing reasonable time limit on filing of Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 55(c) motion to remove entry of default).\n\n          Application  of the  reasonableness  principle to  this\n\ncase is straightforward.   Given that the district  court delayed\n\nruling on  the first  extension motion for  several weeks  before\n\nallowing it,  appellants had reason to wait until near the end of\n\nwhat  would  have  been  the  second  extension  period  in   the\n\nexpectation that the judge would rule momentarily on their second\n\nextension motion.  When the judge had not handed down a ruling by\n\nthe  end  of that  interval,  appellants  promptly renewed  their\n\nmotion,   seeking  a   further  extension.     In   the  peculiar\n\ncircumstances of this case,  we cannot say that the timing of the\n\n                                14\n\nthird   extension    motion   falls   outside   the    realm   of\n\nreasonableness.9\n\n          3.    Good  Cause.    Although  RTC  protests that  the\n          3.    Good  Cause.\n                           \n\nborrowers  failed  to show  good  cause,  the  facts  belie  this\n\nprotestation.   RTC bases its argument on the faulty premise that\n\nit complied  fully with all outstanding discovery demands when it\n\ncavalierly  announced,  more  than three  months  after discovery\n\nresponses initially were  due upon the borrowers' terms,  that it\n\nwould  deign  to produce  documents  at a  site  and time  of its\n\nchoosing.10   See Chronology, supra, at  No. 3.  We  do not agree\n                                   \n\nthat  this  ipse dixit  was  the  functional equivalent  of  full\n                      \n\ncompliance with outstanding discovery requests.\n\n          The rules provide that interrogatories must be answered\n\nwithin  30 days, see  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 33(b)(3),  and RTC's offer\n                    \n\nmade no  provision whatever for  fulfilling that obligation.   Of\n\n                    \n\n     9The absence of any satisfactory explanation by the judge as\nto why the second and third extensions were denied weighs heavily\nin our resolution of this issue.   And that shortcoming is one of\nseveral factors that distinguish this  case from Mendez v.  Banco\n                                                                 \nPopular de  Puerto Rico, 900 F.2d  4 (1st Cir. 1990),  upon which\n                       \nRTC  pins its  hopes.   In contrast  to the  case at  bar, Mendez\n                                                                 \ninvolved  \"a   district  court's   reasoned   refusal  to   grant\n                                           \nincremental enlargements of time.\"  Id. at 7 (emphasis supplied).\n                                       \nFurthermore, Mendez did not implicate Rule 56(f) at  all; rather,\n                   \nthe case concerned a motion for an enlargement of time under Fed.\nR. Civ. P.  6(b).  See id.  at 6.  Finally,  Mendez presented the\n                                                   \nvery  different case  of an  attorney who,  unlike the  Brookses,\nrepeatedly  asked   the  court,  without  any   good  reason,  to\naccommodate his personal schedule.   See id. at 6-7.   A petition\n                                            \nfor  a continuance is always suspect when  it is within the power\nof the petitioner to alter the conditions that allegedly preclude\nhim from acting within the allotted period of time.\n\n     10RTC  proposed to effect  production at the  offices of its\nlaw firm and when \"mutually convenient.\"\n\n                                15\n\nbroader significance,  the rules give the  discovering party, not\n\nthe discovery target,  the option of specifying  the time, place,\n\nand  manner of production  and inspection.   See Fed.  R. Civ. P.\n                                                \n\n34(b).  Absent a court order or an agreement among the litigants,\n\na party from whom discovery  is sought cannot unilaterally  alter\n\nthese directives to suit  its fancy.  This verity  has particular\n\nforce where, as  here, the discovering  party's notice limned  an\n\nentirely   reasonable   time/place/manner  format   for  document\n\nproduction.\n\n          In the  final analysis, a movant's claim  of good cause\n\nmust  be   viewed  against  the  historical   background  of  the\n\nlitigation.   Here,  RTC's  dilatoriness over  a three-year  span\n\nlends  considerable worth  to  the \"goodness\"  of the  borrowers'\n\n\"cause.\"  Although discovery  was due and owing, RTC  did nothing\n\nfor three  months, then made  a token gesture  toward compliance,\n\nthen hibernated for  the next  thirteen months,  and then,  after\n\nrepresenting  to the  court that  it  would promptly  set matters\n\nstraight, twiddled its corporate  thumbs for another nine months.\n\nIt  was only  under the  hammer of  a court  order that  RTC took\n\nsignificant,  albeit  incomplete,  steps  toward  compliance;  it\n\nanswered the  interrogatories on April  2, 1993 (two  weeks after\n\nthe  court-imposed deadline  and well  over two  years  after the\n\nanswers  were  originally  due) and  it  simultaneously  effected\n\npartial  compliance  with the  request  for  document production.\n\nThis was too little and too late.\n\n          In  what  amounts  to   an  effort  at  confession  and\n\n                                16\n\navoidance, RTC labors to shift the focus of our inquiry away from\n\nits chronic disregard  of procedural requirements.   It says that\n\nappellants contributed to the  delay and, at any rate,  that they\n\nwere lax in enforcing discovery deadlines.  We are unimpressed by\n\nthis fingerpointing.\n\n          In  comparison to  RTC, the borrowers'  contribution to\n\nthe litany of delay appears modest.  RTC asserts, correctly, that\n\nthe borrowers waited two weeks before beginning inspection of the\n\ninitial batch of records, and that they then took from April 9 to\n\nMay  20  to review  the  documents delivered  to  their counsel's\n\noffice.     On  the   whole,  however,  neither   interval  seems\n\nunreasonable.   The former  period strikes us  as no more  than a\n\nroutine  scheduling  glitch  and  the latter  period  is  largely\n\nexcused  by   the  family   illness  documented  in   the  second\n\ncontinuance motion (and not disputed by RTC).\n\n          RTC's effort to place  the blame for two lost  years on\n\nappellants'  shoulders  is  disingenuous.     When  discovery  is\n\nappropriately  initiated, the burden  of compliance lies foremost\n\nwith the party from whom the discovery is sought.  Of course, the\n\ndiscovering party has the right to file a motion to  compel under\n\nFed. R.  Civ. P. 37, see  R.W. Int'l Corp. v.  Welch Foods, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n937  F.2d  11, 15-20  (1st  Cir. 1991)  (discussing  mechanics of\n\nmotion  practice under  Rule  37),  but  this  right  is  not  an\n\nobligation.   Rule  37  contains no  time  limit, and,  unless  a\n\nparticular  situation  presents special  circumstances suggesting\n\n                                17\n\nthat   concepts  of   waiver  or   estoppel  should   apply,11  a\n\ndiscovering party's  failure to invoke Rule  37 celeritously will\n\nnot  excuse  the  guilty  party's  failure  to  furnish  required\n\ndiscovery  in a timely manner.  RTC's argument to the contrary is\n\nreminiscent of an embezzler who  seeks to avoid the  consequences\n\nof  his defalcation  by  criticizing the  victim  as having  been\n\ncareless with its  funds or  slow in reporting  shortages to  the\n\npolice.\n\n          We will not  whip a dead horse.  RTC  has cited no case\n\nin which  a Rule 56(f) motion  was denied on the  ground that the\n\nmovant, having  sought  discovery expeditiously,  then failed  to\n\ntake heroic measures to enforce his rights against a recalcitrant\n\nopponent.   We decline  to  break new  ground and  set  so odd  a\n\nprecedent.  While  there are  no model litigants  here    neither\n\nside has  done its  utmost to  advance the case    we  think that\n\nunder operative norms of litigation practice  and the totality of\n\nthe  extant  circumstances, appellants'  lassitude  in  moving to\n\ncompel did not excuse RTC's protracted dawdling.\n\n          Before   leaving  this   topic,   we  offer   a   final\n\nobservation.    With  minor  exceptions not  relevant  here,  the\n\nFederal  Rules of Civil Procedure apply to the government as well\n\nas to all other litigants.  See United States v.  Yellow Cab Co.,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     11A  handful  of  courts  have  denied  Rule  37  motions as\nunreasonably  late  when brought  on the  eve  of trial  or under\nsimilar circumstances.   See, e.g.,  Price v. Maryland  Cas. Co.,\n                                                                \n561  F.2d 609, 611  (5th Cir. 1977);  Lapenna v.

Indeed, because the  government is  rendered\n\nuniquely powerful by its  vast resources and statutory authority,\n\nit has a  special responsibility to  abide by civil  adjudicatory\n\nrules.  Here, RTC shirked this responsibility.\n\n          4.    Utility.   We  next  consider whether  appellants\n          4.    Utility.\n                       \n\npresented  a  plausible  basis  for a  belief  that  discoverable\n\nmaterials exist  that  would likely  suffice to  raise a  genuine\n\nissue of material fact  and, thus, defeat summary judgment.   See\n                                                                 \n\nNestor Colon,  964 F.2d  at  38; Price,  931 F.2d  at  164.   For\n                                      \n\npurposes of achieving  this benchmark, a Rule 56(f)  proffer need\n\nnot be  presented in a form suitable for admission as evidence at\n\ntrial, so  long as it rises sufficiently  above mere speculation.\n\nSee Carney v.  United States,      F.3d    ,      (2d Cir.  1994)\n                            \n\n[1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5449 at *16].  This is as it should be, for\n\nRule 56(f) is best understood as a complement to other provisions\n\ncontained  in Rule 56, allowing the opposing party to explain why\n\nhe is as of yet unable to file a full-fledged opposition, subject\n\nto  the more  harrowing evidentiary  standard that  governs under\n\n                                19\n\nRules 56(e) and  56(c).12   See 10A Charles  Alan Wright,  Arthur\n                               \n\nR.  Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal  Practice &amp; Procedure   2740,\n                                                         \n\nat 530-31 (1987 &amp; Supp. 1993).\n\n          We think  that appellants'  proffer passes the  test of\n\nutility.  In the affidavit accompanying the  motion, Cathy Brooks\n\nstates, among other things:\n\n          When I  completed my review of documents that\n          RTC did  produce,  I reviewed  them  with  my\n          client  Betty Wells Scott .  . . .   Based in\n          part upon her recollection, in part on my own\n          experience with banks' procedures  and record\n          keeping with respect  to construction  loans,\n          and  in  part on  documents  obtained through\n          other sources,  I have reason to believe that\n          RTC  has  not  produced  all  of the  records\n          requested.\n\n          RTC  attacks this  statement as  inherently unreliable.\n\nIt draws analogies to two cases in which we discounted Rule 56(f)\n\nproffers for vagueness.   See Mattoon v. City of  Pittsfield, 980\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1992); Peterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 989.  But\n                                          \n\nhere,  the proffer  contained  more than  gauzy generalities;  it\n\nspecified  seventeen  categories   of  materials  requested   but\n\nwithheld.\n\n          RTC also draws an analogy to Hebert, 744 F.2d at 220, a\n                                             \n\ncase  in which a Rule 56(f) affidavit was rejected partly because\n\nit recounted the affiant's conversations with a third person.  In\n\nthis  case,  however, although  the  Brooks  affidavit refers  to\n\n                    \n\n     12Although Rule 56 sets out stricter standards for materials\noffered  on the merits of  a summary judgment  motion, see, e.g.,\n                                                                \nGarside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,  895 F.2d 46, 49-50 (1st Cir.  1990),\n                          \nthose standards  do not apply to proffers  under Rule 56(f).  See\n                                                                 \nCarney,  supra;  see  also   Committee  for  First  Amendment  v.\n                                                             \nCampbell, 962 F.2d 1517, 1522 (10th Cir. 1992).\n        \n\n                                20\n\nconclusions  drawn by  a third  person, the  challenged reference\n\nmerely provides  a partial  basis for Brooks'  good-faith belief.\n\nSince  Rule  56(f) requires  a movant  to  spell out  the reasons\n\nunderpinning  the  conclusion  that  further  discovery would  be\n\nfutile,  and since the  other bases  for Attorney  Brooks' belief\n\nfell well within her personal knowledge, we are unprepared to say\n\nthat  this brief  reference  spoiled the  proffer.   Accordingly,\n\nappellants' motion satisfies the utility requirement.\n\n          5.  Materiality.   Conceding nothing, RTC also contests\n          5.  Materiality.\n                         \n\nthe materiality of the facts that the borrowers wish to discover.\n\nWe  think  that materiality  for  purposes  of Rule  56(f)  means\n\nmaterial to  the issues raised  on summary judgment,  and, hence,\n\nthe kind of additional discovery that will serve to vivify a Rule\n\n56(f) motion is theoretically different from, and ordinarily will\n\nbe  more  restricted  than,   the  kind  of  discovery  generally\n\npermitted  under  the Federal  Rules.   See  First Nat'l  Bank v.\n                                                              \n\nCities Serv.  Co., 391 U.S. 253, 298 (1968).  In short, the facts\n                 \n\nthat  the movant seeks to discover must be foreseeably capable of\n\nbreathing life into  his claim or defense.  See  Licari,     F.3d\n                                                       \n\nat     [slip op. at  16]; Taylor v. Gallagher, 737 F.2d  134, 137\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1984).\n\n          Evaluating  the potential significance of unknown facts\n\nin regard to unadjudicated issues is something  of a metaphysical\n\nexercise.   Consequently,  the threshold  of materiality  at this\n\nstage of a case is necessarily low.  Cf., e.g.,  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nAgurs, 427  U.S. 97, 103  (1976) (explaining that  a fact may  be\n     \n\n                                21\n\nmaterial  for some purposes as  long as there  is \"any reasonable\n\nlikelihood\"  that  it could  affect  the  outcome).   Appellants'\n\nproffer crosses that threshold.\n\n          It cannot  be gainsaid  that the  issues raised in  the\n\ncomplaint, answer, and counterclaims are complicated.  The issues\n\nraised in  the SJM mirror this  complexity.  In an  effort to cut\n\nthrough the  legal tangle, we parse the premises on which the SJM\n\nrests   and   contrast   them   with    appellants'   prospective\n\ncounterarguments.\n\n          RTC insists that appellants' defenses and counterclaims\n\nare  entirely barred by reason of (i) the provisions contained in\n\nthe extension  agreement and general  release, see supra  note 1,\n                                                        \n\n(ii) the mandate of 12 U.S.C.   1823(e), and/or (iii) the D'Oench\n                                                                 \n\ndoctrine, see D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC,  315 U.S. 447 (1942).\n                                          \n\nThe borrowers  resist this  onslaught by  positing  (i) that  the\n\nextension agreement  and general release are  products of duress,\n\nand, hence, void  (or voidable);  and (ii) that  claims based  on\n\nviolations  of  the  plain  terms of  an  agreement  that  itself\n\ncomports with  the requisites  of  section 1823  and the  D'Oench\n                                                                 \n\ndoctrine are not barred.\n\n          In  respect  to  this  last  assertion,  the  borrowers\n\nmaintain that  further discovery  will prove ComFed  violated the\n\nplain  terms  of  the  construction  loan  agreement in  that  it\n\ndisbursed  loan  proceeds improperly  by  (i)  paying contractors\n\ndirectly,  without  authorization,  (ii)  paying  for work  never\n\ncompleted, (iii) paying for substandard work, and (iv) paying for\n\n                                22\n\nwork that deviated  from the construction  plans.  The  allegedly\n\ndiscoverable facts bear directly  on the applicability of section\n\n1823(e) and the D'Oench doctrine.  They also bear, albeit perhaps\n                       \n\nless obviously, on  the question  of duress (and,  hence, on  the\n\nenforceability of  the extension agreement  and general  release)\n\nbecause  duress in this type  of setting requires  proof that the\n\ncoercing party caused the financial plight  of the coerced party.\n\nSee  International Underwater  Contractors, Inc.  v. New  England\n                                                                 \n\nTel. &amp; Tel. Co., 393 N.E.2d 968, 970 (Mass.

If, at this stage of the proceedings, a lack\n\nof materiality is  not apparent, then  an inquiring court  should\n\nerr, if at all, on the side of liberality.

Capizzi concluded that  a lender's threat  to\n                           \nforeclose could  not constitute  duress because the  borrower had\nthe  option  of  vigorously  defending  against  the  foreclosure\naction.  In  this case, it  is not clearly  established that  the\nborrowers  had such  an option,  for Mrs.  Scott suggests  in her\naffidavit  that she had no knowledge of her potential defenses at\n\n                                23\n\npertains  closely to  the underpinning  for those  arguments, the\n\nRule 56(f) motion passes the materiality test.\n\n                          C.  Synthesis.\n                                       \n\n          We have now established, perhaps at greater length than\n\nnecessary, that  appellants' motion satisfies  the strictures  of\n\nRule 56(f).   And though  we leave  open the  possibility that  a\n\ncourt  may  deny  even a  facially  valid  Rule  56(f) motion  in\n\nappropriate  circumstances, the  aspects  of  the situation  here\n\nmilitate strongly in favor of granting a continuance.\n\n          In the first place, the facts needed to oppose  summary\n\njudgment  are in RTC's exclusive control.  This is a circumstance\n\nthat  can assume decretory significance.  See Hebert, 744 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n222 n.4 (suggesting that, once the benchmarks for a valid proffer\n\nare  met, \"continuances  should be  routinely granted  under Rule\n\n56(f)  where the moving party has sole possession of the relevant\n\nfacts\").  In the second place, the incompleteness of discovery is\n\nRTC's fault.  When litigants spar over Rule 56(f),  fault packs a\n\nconsiderable wallop  in inscribing the  scorecard.  See  Sames v.\n                                                              \n\nGable,  732 F.2d  49, 51  (3d Cir.  1984) (explaining  that, when\n     \n\nreasonably diligent  efforts to obtain evidence  from the summary\n\njudgment proponent  have been  thwarted, continuances \"should  be\n\ngranted almost as  a matter of  course\"); see also  International\n                                                                 \n\nShortstop, Inc. v.

Spencer, 393\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 108, 109 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 866 (1970);\n                                           \n\nsee  also 10A Federal Practice  Procedure, supra,    2741, at n.2\n                                                \n\n(collecting cases holding  that a grant of summary  judgment with\n\ndiscovery outstanding constitutes clear error).\n\n          Giving  these  additional   factors  due  weight,   and\n\nconsidering the  record as a  whole, we conclude  without serious\n\nquestion that  the court below  abused its discretion  in denying\n\nthe borrowers' third  Rule 56(f)  motion.  See  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nRoberts,  978  F.2d 17,  21 (1st  Cir.  1992) (explaining  that a\n       \n\ndistrict  court  abuses  its  discretion,  inter  alia,  when  it\n                                                      \n\n\"commits a palpable error of judgment\").\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need  go no  further.14   In  civil as  in criminal\n\nlitigation, the government may strike forceful blows, so long  as\n\nthey are struck within the rules.  Here, the government  went too\n\nfar, frustrating appellants'  legitimate discovery initiatives by\n\n                    \n\n     14In light of our finding that the court below improvidently\ndenied  a  further  continuance  to  the  borrowers, we  have  no\noccasion  to reach,  and express no  opinion upon,  the remaining\nassignments  of error.    We  deem  it  appropriate  to  mention,\nhowever,  that,  contrary  to  the  borrowers'  suggestion,  this\ncircuit   has   approved,  in   appropriate   circumstances,  the\nadjudication  of summary  judgment motions  on the  papers, i.e.,\n                                                                \nwithout oral argument.  See, e.g., Cia. Petrolera Caribe, Inc. v.\n                                                              \nArco Caribbean, Inc., 754 F.2d 404, 411 (1st Cir. 1985).\n                    \n\n                                25\n\nplaying   keepaway.     The  district   court  should   not  have\n\ncountenanced, much less rewarded, such dubious conduct.\n\n          The order denying relief  under Rule 56(f) is reversed,\n                                                                 \n\nthe judgment below  is vacated, and the cause is  remanded to the\n                                                                 \n\ndistrict court for further proceedings.

In one corner, the plaintiff,  a\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\ngovernment agency, having won  by a knockout in the  court below,\n\nasserts that this is a case about defendants who demand their own\n\ntimetable for  pretrial discovery  and motion  practice.  In  the\n\nother corner, a group of defendants, having been laid low by what\n\nthey claim was  a rabbit punch, assert that this  is a case about\n\nthe  government flouting  court-imposed deadlines  and procedural\n\nrules.    After  reconstructing  the  chronology  of  events,  we\n\nconclude that the defendants are  substantially correct.  We also\n\nconclude that the  district court, instead  of hurrying to  grant\n\nsummary judgment, should have held the government accountable for\n\nthe  lack  of  punctual  discovery  and  given  the  government's\n\nlitigation  adversaries  a fair  opportunity  to formulate  their\n\nopposition.\n\nI.  THE VIEW FROM RINGSIDE\n\n          At  the height  of a  boom market  in real  estate, two\n\nneophytes,  Ralph H. Scott, II, a physician, and his wife, Betty,\n\ndecided to  build a  large, expensive residential  subdivision on\n\nthe  picturesque  island  of  Martha's  Vineyard.    In  order to\n\nproceed, Dr.  and Mrs. Scott  formed a corporation,  North Bridge\n\nAssociates,  Inc.    The   Scotts  and  North  Bridge  Associates\n\n(collectively, \"borrowers\" or \"appellants\")  then executed a note\n\nin favor of  ComFed Savings Bank (\"ComFed\" or  \"the bank\") in the\n\namount  of $2,995,000.  The borrowers closed the loan on November\n\n25,  1987,  securing  it  by  a  mortgage  on  the  North  Bridge\n\nsubdivision.   They also  executed a construction  loan agreement\n\n                                3\n\nthat  specified when and how the bank would disburse the borrowed\n\nfunds.\n\n          The   venture   experienced   several  setbacks.      A\n\nparticularly vexing problem involved abutting property owners who\n\neventually  served a  lis  pendens asserting  that title  defects\n                                  \n\ninvalidated easements  essential to the  subdivision's viability.\n\nAt this  delicate juncture, the bank  shut off the  flow of funds\n\nand  construction ground  to a  halt.   When the  promissory note\n\nmatured on November 25,  1988, the borrowers failed to  repay the\n\noutstanding   balance.     In  a   last-ditch  effort   to  avert\n\nforeclosure, they  capitulated to ComFed's  demands.  As  part of\n\nthe  tribute  that ComFed  exacted  for  deferring the  repayment\n\nobligation, the  borrowers  signed  an  extension  agreement  and\n\ngeneral  release   surrendering   all  potential   defenses   and\n\ncounterclaims.1\n\n          The loan remained  unpaid at the  end of the  extension\n\nperiod.   The  bank then  sued the  borrowers in  a Massachusetts\n\nstate court.  The borrowers answered and counterclaimed alleging,\n\ninter alia,  that ComFed  had  broken its  promises, violated  an\n          \n\nimplied  covenant of  good  faith and  fair dealing,  disregarded\n\nfiduciary   responsibilities,   and    engaged   in    fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation.   They also asked  the court to  set aside the\n\n                    \n\n     1In  the extension agreement, the borrowers represented that\n\"no defenses, offsets, or counterclaims exist to the full payment\nof  such  indebtedness in  accordance with  its  terms.\"   In the\ngeneral release, they purposed  to discharge ComFed \"of  and from\nany  and all  debts,  demands, action,  causes of  action, suits,\naccounts, covenants,  and damages which  North Bridge Associates,\nInc. or its officers . . . may have or ever had . . . .\"\n\n                                4\n\nextension agreement and general release on grounds of duress.\n\n          Inasmuch  as  procedural  tussles  have  dominated  the\n\ncourse  of this litigation,  we deem  it prudent  to set  forth a\n\ndetailed chronology  of relevant events occurring  from and after\n\nthe  time  that the  parties  joined  issue.    In doing  so,  we\n\neliminate  many  matters unimportant  to  our  resolution of  the\n\nissues on appeal.2\n\n          1.   December 20, 1990.   The borrowers serve\n          1.   December 20, 1990.\n          interrogatories  and  a request  for document\n          production.    In compliance  with applicable\n          procedural  rules, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b),\n                                \n          the request sets a reasonable  time and place\n          for production, specifying that the documents\n          shall  be  produced  within  30  days at  the\n          offices of the borrowers' lawyers.\n\n          2.   January  23, 1991.   Following  ComFed's\n          2.   January  23, 1991.\n          failure,  the  Resolution  Trust  Corporation\n          (\"RTC\"), having been appointed as conservator\n          (and  soon  to  be  appointed  receiver),  is\n          substituted  as the  party plaintiff  and, on\n          April  1, 1991,  removes  the  action to  the\n          federal district court.\n\n          3.  April 16, 1991.  Over three  months after\n          3.  April 16, 1991.\n\n                    \n\n     2At the  time the  borrowers initiated discovery,  the state\ncourt had  jurisdiction and, accordingly, the  borrowers' initial\ndiscovery requests  were governed when made  by the Massachusetts\nRules  of Civil Procedure.   The action  was soon  removed to the\nfederal  district court.  See  Chronology, infra, at  No.2.  This\n                                                \nprocedural wrinkle has  no effect on  our ensuing discussion  for\ntwo  reasons.   First, removed  cases are  governed fully  by the\nFederal  Rules, and are treated  no differently than  if they had\noriginated in  a federal forum.   See Fed. R. Civ.  P. 81(c); see\n                                                                 \nalso Granny  Goose Foods, Inc.  v.

Second,  the state's  procedural  rules\nparallel   their   federal   counterparts   in   their   relevant\nparticulars.  See, e.g.,  Mass. R. Civ. P. 34(b)  (directing that\n                       \nrequests  for  document  production \"specify  a  reasonable time,\nplace, and manner  of making  the inspection  and performing  the\nrelated  acts\"); Mass. R. Civ. P. 33(a) (allotting 45 days within\nwhich to answer interrogatories).  For simplicity's sake, we cite\nonly to the Federal Rules.\n\n                                5\n\n          the date on  which the plaintiff's  discovery\n          responses  were  due,   RTC  takes  a  first,\n          tentative step toward responding:   it offers\n          to  produce  the  described   documents,  but\n          attempts unilaterally  to amend the  time and\n          place  for  production.    No  documents  are\n          received and nothing is said with  respect to\n          the  answers   to  interrogatories  although,\n          under the Federal Rules, the answers were due\n          within 30  days of service, see  Fed. R. Civ.\n                                         \n          P. 33(b)(3).\n\n          4.  May 26, 1992.  After thirteen more months\n          4.  May 26, 1992.\n          without  incident or action  of any kind, the\n          district  judge  holds  a status  conference.\n          RTC   agrees   to  provide   all  outstanding\n          discovery \"promptly.\"\n\n          5.   February  22, 1993.   RTC  fritters away\n          5.   February  22, 1993.\n          another nine  months.  Eventually,  the judge\n          convenes  a second  status conference.   This\n          time,  RTC  comes  armed with  a  motion  for\n          partial summary  judgment (\"the SJM\").3   The\n          judge   orders   all  outstanding   discovery\n          obligations  honored  by  March  24,  at  the\n          latest.\n\n          6.  March 2,  1993.  As no progress  has been\n          6.  March 2,  1993.\n          made  toward  completion  of  discovery,  the\n          borrowers file the first of three motions for\n          enlargement  of  the  time  within  which  to\n          oppose the  SJM.   The  borrowers' motion  is\n          accompanied   by   an  attorney's   affidavit\n          detailing  the  history  of  the  action  and\n          noting  that, more than  two years after they\n          should   have   been   delivered,   discovery\n          materials are still in the pipeline.\n\n          7.    March  18,  1993.    RTC  notifies  the\n          7.    March  18,  1993.\n          borrowers   that   it   has   gathered   some\n          responsive documents, and  suggests that  the\n          parties agree upon a mutually convenient time\n          to review them.\n\n          8.   March 25,  1993.  Over  RTC's objection,\n          8.   March 25,  1993.\n\n                    \n\n     3The SJM addressed  only count  1 of the  complaint and  the\nborrowers'   several  counterclaims.     The  remainder   of  the\ncomplaint,  dealing principally  with RTC's  effort to  reach and\napply  assets standing  in  the name  of  a related  third  party\n(himself a defendant), remains pending in the district court.\n\n                                6\n\n          the  district  court  grants  the  borrowers'\n          motion and extends the time for opposing  the\n          SJM to April 16, 1993.\n\n          9.   April 2, 1993.   The interrogatories are\n          9.   April 2, 1993.\n          finally answered and, on  the same date,  the\n          borrowers'  attorneys  review  the  documents\n          that RTC has made  available at its counsel's\n          offices.\n\n          10.   April 9, 1993.   Some of  the documents\n          10.   April 9, 1993.\n          originally  requested  on  December 2,  1990,\n          amounting to  over 2,000  pages, are at  long\n          last   delivered  to   the  offices   of  the\n          borrowers'  lawyers,  Peter and  Cathy Brooks\n          (who are husband and wife).  On the same day,\n          however,   the   Brooks'   infant    son   is\n          hospitalized and placed in an  intensive care\n          unit.  He remains there,  initially, for nine\n          days, and is readmitted  on April 20.    Upon\n          discharge  three days later,  he continues to\n          require special attention.\n\n          11.   April 12,  1993.  The  borrowers file a\n          11.   April 12,  1993.\n          motion   in  which  they  request  a  further\n          enlargement of time until May 14, 1993.  This\n          motion  is not  accompanied by  an affidavit,\n          but,  in  an  accompanying memorandum,  Peter\n          Brooks (who authored the affidavit in support\n          of the first extension motion)  describes the\n          medical  emergency and informs the court that\n          the  borrowers  cannot intelligently  address\n          the SJM  until they  have time to  review the\n          compendious discovery materials produced only\n          a few days earlier.\n\n          12.

Without giving notice or\n          15.

The  court  offers  no\n          meaningful   explanation   for  any   of  its\n          rulings.   In due course,  the court  invokes\n          Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) and enters judgment.\n\n          The  borrowers appeal.5    They assert  that the  lower\n\ncourt  erred:    in  denying  their  second  and  third extension\n\nmotions;  in   taking  up   the  SJM  while   discovery  remained\n\nincomplete,  and  without  prior  notice  or  a  hearing; and  in\n\ngranting the  SJM  despite  the presence  of  genuine  issues  of\n\nmaterial fact.\n\nII.

It is, after\n\nall, black  letter law that  when a  rule requires an  act to  be\n\ndone, and does  not specify a time for doing it, courts generally\n\n                    \n\n     8The only deadline  that arguably might apply  arises out of\nthe  requirement that  affidavits opposing  a motion  for summary\njudgment  must be submitted at least one day before the scheduled\nhearing  on the  motion.

Pa. 1970) (imposing reasonable time limit on filing of Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 55(c) motion to remove entry of default).\n\n          Application  of the  reasonableness  principle to  this\n\ncase is straightforward.   Given that the district  court delayed\n\nruling on  the first  extension motion for  several weeks  before\n\nallowing it,  appellants had reason to wait until near the end of\n\nwhat  would  have  been  the  second  extension  period  in   the\n\nexpectation that the judge would rule momentarily on their second\n\nextension motion.  When the judge had not handed down a ruling by\n\nthe  end  of that  interval,  appellants  promptly renewed  their\n\nmotion,   seeking  a   further  extension.     In   the  peculiar\n\ncircumstances of this case,  we cannot say that the timing of the\n\n                                14\n\nthird   extension    motion   falls   outside   the    realm   of\n\nreasonableness.9\n\n          3.    Good  Cause.    Although  RTC  protests that  the\n          3.    Good  Cause.\n                           \n\nborrowers  failed  to show  good  cause,  the  facts  belie  this\n\nprotestation.   RTC bases its argument on the faulty premise that\n\nit complied  fully with all outstanding discovery demands when it\n\ncavalierly  announced,  more  than three  months  after discovery\n\nresponses initially were  due upon the borrowers' terms,  that it\n\nwould  deign  to produce  documents  at a  site  and time  of its\n\nchoosing.10   See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Chronology,</span> supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at  No. 3.

See Fed.  R. Civ. P.\n                                                \n\n34(b).  Absent a court order or an agreement among the litigants,\n\na party from whom discovery  is sought cannot unilaterally  alter\n\nthese directives to suit  its fancy.  This verity  has particular\n\nforce where, as  here, the discovering  party's notice limned  an\n\nentirely   reasonable   time/place/manner  format   for  document\n\nproduction.\n\n          In the  final analysis, a movant's claim  of good cause\n\nmust  be   viewed  against  the  historical   background  of  the\n\nlitigation.   Here,  RTC's  dilatoriness over  a three-year  span\n\nlends  considerable worth  to  the \"goodness\"  of the  borrowers'\n\n\"cause.\"  Although discovery  was due and owing, RTC  did nothing\n\nfor three  months, then made  a token gesture  toward compliance,\n\nthen hibernated for  the next  thirteen months,  and then,  after\n\nrepresenting  to the  court that  it  would promptly  set matters\n\nstraight, twiddled its corporate  thumbs for another nine months.\n\nIt  was only  under the  hammer of  a court  order that  RTC took\n\nsignificant,  albeit  incomplete,  steps  toward  compliance;  it\n\nanswered the  interrogatories on April  2, 1993 (two  weeks after\n\nthe  court-imposed deadline  and well  over two  years  after the\n\nanswers  were  originally  due) and  it  simultaneously  effected\n\npartial  compliance  with the  request  for  document production.\n\nThis was too little and too late.\n\n          In  what  amounts  to   an  effort  at  confession  and\n\n                                16\n\navoidance, RTC labors to shift the focus of our inquiry away from\n\nits chronic disregard  of procedural requirements.   It says that\n\nappellants contributed to the  delay and, at any rate,  that they\n\nwere lax in enforcing discovery deadlines.  We are unimpressed by\n\nthis fingerpointing.\n\n          In  comparison to  RTC, the borrowers'  contribution to\n\nthe litany of delay appears modest.  RTC asserts, correctly, that\n\nthe borrowers waited two weeks before beginning inspection of the\n\ninitial batch of records, and that they then took from April 9 to\n\nMay  20  to review  the  documents delivered  to  their counsel's\n\noffice.     On  the   whole,  however,  neither   interval  seems\n\nunreasonable.   The former  period strikes us  as no more  than a\n\nroutine  scheduling  glitch  and  the latter  period  is  largely\n\nexcused  by   the  family   illness  documented  in   the  second\n\ncontinuance motion (and not disputed by RTC).\n\n          RTC's effort to place  the blame for two lost  years on\n\nappellants'  shoulders  is  disingenuous.     When  discovery  is\n\nappropriately  initiated, the burden  of compliance lies foremost\n\nwith the party from whom the discovery is sought.  Of course, the\n\ndiscovering party has the right to file a motion to  compel under\n\nFed. R.  Civ. P. 37, see  R.W. Int'l Corp. v.  Welch Foods, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563789\"><a href=\"/opinion/563789/rw-international-corp-and-t-h-ward-de-la-cruz-inc-v-welch-foods/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15-20  (1st  Cir. 1991)  (discussing  mechanics of\n\nmotion  practice under  Rule  37),  but  this  right  is  not  an\n\nobligation.   Rule  37  contains no  time  limit, and,  unless  a\n\nparticular  situation  presents special  circumstances suggesting\n\n                                17\n\nthat   concepts  of   waiver  or   estoppel  should   apply,11  a\n\ndiscovering party's  failure to invoke Rule  37 celeritously will\n\nnot  excuse  the  guilty  party's  failure  to  furnish  required\n\ndiscovery  in a timely manner.  RTC's argument to the contrary is\n\nreminiscent of an embezzler who  seeks to avoid the  consequences\n\nof  his defalcation  by  criticizing the  victim  as having  been\n\ncareless with its  funds or  slow in reporting  shortages to  the\n\npolice.\n\n          We will not  whip a dead horse.  RTC  has cited no case\n\nin which  a Rule 56(f) motion  was denied on the  ground that the\n\nmovant, having  sought  discovery expeditiously,  then failed  to\n\ntake heroic measures to enforce his rights against a recalcitrant\n\nopponent.   We decline  to  break new  ground and  set  so odd  a\n\nprecedent.  While  there are  no model litigants  here    neither\n\nside has  done its  utmost to  advance the case    we  think that\n\nunder operative norms of litigation practice  and the totality of\n\nthe  extant  circumstances, appellants'  lassitude  in  moving to\n\ncompel did not excuse RTC's protracted dawdling.\n\n          Before   leaving  this   topic,   we  offer   a   final\n\nobservation.    With  minor  exceptions not  relevant  here,  the\n\nFederal  Rules of Civil Procedure apply to the government as well\n\nas to all other litigants.  See United States v.

Capizzi concluded that  a lender's threat  to\n                           \nforeclose could  not constitute  duress because the  borrower had\nthe  option  of  vigorously  defending  against  the  foreclosure\naction.

And though  we leave  open the  possibility that  a\n\ncourt  may  deny  even a  facially  valid  Rule  56(f) motion  in\n\nappropriate  circumstances, the  aspects  of  the situation  here\n\nmilitate strongly in favor of granting a continuance.\n\n          In the first place, the facts needed to oppose  summary\n\njudgment  are in RTC's exclusive control.
