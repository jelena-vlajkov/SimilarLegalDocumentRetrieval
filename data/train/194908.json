Pro-se  appellant Philip Waters appeals the\n               \n\ndistrict court dismissal  of his claims to have  been injured\n\nin  violation of state and federal civil rights laws, as well\n\nas of  state tort  law.   The  injuries are  alleged to  have\n\nstemmed  from a conspiracy on the part of police officers, an\n\nunidentified witness, and  the prosecuting assistant district\n\nattorney   to   secure  Waters'   conviction   through  false\n\ntestimony.  The district court dismissed the  claims as time-\n\nbarred.  We affirm.\n\n     In June 1987,  Waters was tried  and convicted of  arson\n\nand  assault to commit murder  in connection with  a fire the\n\nprevious  year in  Dorchester,  Massachusetts.    During  the\n\ntrial,   appellee   officers  testified   that   they  either\n\ndispatched or heard the name and description of Waters as the\n\nsuspect of the arson.    Appellee Larkin was  the prosecuting\n\nattorney.   On  October 6,  1987, Waters  obtained  a written\n\ntranscript of  police and fire  department communication logs\n\nconcerning  the  Dorchester   fire.    After   examining  the\n\ntranscript,  Waters concluded  that the  police  officers had\n\nperjured themselves  at  this trial.1    In August  1990,  he\n\n                    \n\n1.    The alleged perjury appears to consist of the fact that\nat trial testimony was presented that two descriptions of the\nsuspected arsonist were broadcast  by the police  immediately\nafter  the fire.    The first described  the suspect as being\nfive feet, ten inches tall, the second as being six feet, six\ninches  tall.  Waters alleges that only the first description\nwas actually broadcast  and that the second was fabricated to\naccord with  the fact that  he is  six feet six  inches tall.\nThe first  description did, however, identify  Waters by name\n\nfiled a motion for a new trial in state court on the basis of\n\nthis alleged perjury.2\n\n     The instant  suit was commenced  on August 26,  1992, in\n\nthe   Middlesex  County  Superior  Court,  after  Waters  had\n\nobtained  am  audio  transmission  of  the  police  and  fire\n\ndepartment  communications   on  the  night  of   the  arson.\n\nLiberally construed, the suit alleges violations of state and\n\nfederal civil rights laws, M.G.L. c.12,  11I; 42 U.S.C.  1981\n\net. seq., and other  tortious conduct by police officers,  an\n       \n\nunidentified bystander and the prosecuting attorney.   Waters\n\nsought declaratory, injunctive and damage relief.  On October\n\n15, 1992,  appellee Gaddy  removed the  suit to  the District\n\nCourt  for  the District  of  Massachusetts,  pursuant to  28\n\nU.S.C.   1441(b).  The court granted the motion to dismiss of\n\nappellee officers  on the ground  that \"the action  was filed\n\nafter the statute  of limitations had run.\"    The  motion to\n\ndismiss of  appellee Assistant District  Attorney Larkin  was\n\ngranted on  the grounds  that he possessed  absolute immunity\n\nfrom suit and that  the statute of limitations had run.  This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n     Each  of  Waters' claims  is  subject  to a  three  year\n\nstatute of limitations.  Massachusetts law provides that both\n\n                    \n\non  the basis of eyewitness testimony of those present at the\ntime the fire was set.\n\n2.  The  record does  not  indicate the  disposition of  this\nmotion.\n\n                             -3-\n\nactions arising  out of  alleged violations of  civil rights,\n\nM.G.L.  c.260,   5B, and  actions  sounding  in tort,  M.G.L.\n\nc.260,  2A, must  be commenced within three  years next after\n\nthe  cause  of action  accrues.   The  same limit  applies to\n\nclaims  under  the Massachusetts  Torts  Claim  Act.   M.G.L.\n\nc.258,  4.   Since the  federal civil rights  statute has  no\n\nspecific period of limitation, the court is required to apply\n\nthe period of limitation of the most appropriate or analogous\n\nstate  statute.  Goodman v.  Lukens Steel Co.,  482 U.S. 656,\n                                            \n\n660  (1987).    This  court  has  found  that  a  three  year\n\nlimitations period  applies to  federal  civil rights  claims\n\narising  in Massachusetts.   Johnson  v. Rodriguez,  943 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n104, 107 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 948 (1992).\n                                      \n\n     Waters asserts  that the statute of  limitations in this\n\ncase  was  tolled by  the  fact that  he  was unaware  of any\n\nperjured testimony until after the trial at which the alleged\n\nperjury occurred,  due to fraudulent concealment  of facts by\n\nthe  appellees.   Under the  Massachusetts discovery  rule, a\n\ncause of action does  not accrue \"until the facts  which gave\n\nrise to  the cause of  action .  . . either  became known  or\n\nshould have become known to the injured party in the exercise\n\nof reasonable diligence.\"  Edwards v. John Hancock Mut.  Life\n                                                             \n\nIns.  Co., 973  F.2d  1027, 1029  (1st  Cir. 1992)  (applying\n        \n\nMassachusetts law); Catrone v. Thoroughbred Racing Ass'n, 929\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 881,  885 (1st  Cir. 1991) (applying  Massachusetts law)\n\n                             -4-\n\n(citing cases).  The plaintiff need not be aware  of the full\n\nextent of the harm which  he has suffered for the  statute to\n\nrun.  Bowen v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Inc., 408 Mass. 204, 206, 557\n                                   \n\nN.E.2d 739, 741  (1990).   \"The important point  is that  the\n\nstatute  of limitations starts to run when an event or events\n\nhave  occurred  that  were   reasonably  likely  to  put  the\n\nplaintiff  on  notice  that  someone  may  have  cause  h[im]\n\ninjury.\"  Id.  See also Malapanis v. Shirazi, 21 Mass.App.Ct.\n                                            \n\n378,  383, 487  N.E.2d 533,  537 (1986) (action  accrues when\n\nreasonably  prudent  person   \"reacting  to  any   suspicious\n\ncircumstances of which he might have  been aware . . . should\n\nhave discovered that he had been harmed\").  While the accrual\n\nperiod  under the federal civil rights statute is a matter of\n\nfederal law, Rivera-Muriente v.  Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349,\n                                              \n\n353 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing cases), the standard  is similar.\n\n\"The  accrual  period  in  a [federal  civil  rights  action]\n\nordinarily starts when the plaintiff knows, or  has reason to\n\nknow,  of the  injury on  which  the action  is based.\"   Id.\n                                                            \n\n(citing cases).\n\n     According  to  Waters, he  was  not  aware  that he  had\n\nsuffered harm from  any perjury until September  1991 when he\n\nobtained  and listened to an  audio tape of  the actual radio\n\ntransmission of the  police and fire department  on the night\n\nof  the  fire.   We  do  not agree.    Waters  admits in  his\n\ncomplaint  that  in  October  1987 he  received  the  written\n\n                             -5-\n\ntranscript of the  conversation which he  later heard on  the\n\ntape  and  that  \"[t]his  transcript showed  [him]  that  the\n\ntestimony of Defendants Gaddy, Gonzales, Kelly, and Ronan was\n\nfalse, and  known to them to be  false.\"  Complaint para. 39.\n\nPlaintiff  also admits that on the basis of this evidence, he\n\nfiled a motion for a new trial in state court.  Id. para. 40.\n                                                  \n\nThe  only new  information added  by the  audio tape  was the\n\nidentification  of  the  voices  of  the  officers,  who  are\n\nidentified on  the written transcript only by number.  Waters\n\nalleges  that  the audio  tape  indicates  that the  original\n\ndescription  was  broadcast  not  by Officer  Gaddy,  as  she\n\ntestified at  trial, but by Officer  Gonzalez.  Nevertheless,\n\nWaters  also  alleges  that the  written  transcript  already\n\nprovided the evidence that Officer Gaddy had perjured herself\n\nin  claiming  to have  broadcast  the  second, more  accurate\n\ndescription.   Thus,  even if,  as Waters  claims,  the audio\n\ntranscript  provided  further  confirmation  of  the  alleged\n\nperjury,  Waters by  his own  admission was already  aware in\n\nOctober 1987 of sufficient  facts to give him reason  to know\n\n                             -6-\n\nthat  he had been harmed.3  Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353;\n                                           \n\nBowen, 408 Mass. at 206, 557 N.E.2d at 741.\n     \n\n     Plaintiff's  cause of  action accrued  at the  latest in\n\nOctober  1987.  Hence, the  present suit, which  was filed in\n\nAugust  1992,   is  barred   by  the  relevant   statutes  of\n\nlimitations.4  \n\n     The grant of the motions to dismiss is affirmed.\n                                                    \n\n                    \n\n3.   Waters asserts that  his cause of action arises  not out\nof  the perjured testimony at  trial but out  of a conspiracy\namong the defendants to deprive him of his rights.  Howsoever\nthe  cause of  action is  characterized, sufficient  facts to\nstart the  limitations period  were possessed by  Waters upon\nhis  reading of the transcript in October 1987.  See Edwards,\n                                                            \n973 F.2d at 1029  (cause of action accrues when  facts giving\nrise  to action,  not legal  theory, are  known or  should be\nknown).\n\n4.  Having found  the  suit  to  be time-barred,  we  do  not\naddress the  question of whether  appellee Assistant District\nAttorney Larkin was entitled to absolute immunity.\n\n                             -7-\n",

During the trial, appellee officers testified that they either dispatched or heard the name and description of Waters as the suspect of the arson.  Appellee Larkin was the prosecuting attorney.  On October 6, 1987, Waters obtained a written transcript of police and fire department communication logs concerning the Dorchester fire.

Sec. 1981 et. seq., and other tortious conduct by police officers, an unidentified bystander and the prosecuting attorney.  Waters sought declaratory, injunctive and damage relief.  On October 15, 1992, appellee Gaddy removed the suit to the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441(b).  The court granted the motion to dismiss of appellee officers on the ground that \"the action was filed after the statute of limitations had run.\"  The motion to dismiss of appellee Assistant District Attorney Larkin was granted on the grounds that he possessed absolute immunity from suit and that the statute of limitations had run.

The same limit applies to claims under the Massachusetts Torts Claim Act.  M.G.L. c.258, Sec. 4. Since the federal civil rights statute has no specific period of limitation, the court is required to apply the period of limitation of the most appropriate or analogous state statute.  Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U.S. 656, 660 (1987).  This court has found that a three year limitations period applies to federal civil rights claims arising in Massachusetts.  Johnson v.

While the accrual period under the federal civil rights statute is a matter of federal law, Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 353 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing cases), the standard is similar.  \"The accrual period in a [federal civil rights action] ordinarily starts when the plaintiff knows, or has reason to know, of the injury on which the action is based.\"  Id.

Nevertheless, Waters also alleges that the written transcript already provided the evidence that Officer Gaddy had perjured herself in claiming to have broadcast the second, more accurate description.

The injuries are alleged to have stemmed from a conspiracy on the part of police officers, an unidentified witness, and the prosecuting assistant district attorney to secure Waters' conviction through false testimony.  The district court dismissed the claims as time-barred.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1987, Waters was tried and convicted of arson and assault to commit murder in connection with a fire the previous year in Dorchester, Massachusetts.  During the trial, appellee officers testified that they either dispatched or heard the name and description of Waters as the suspect of the arson.  Appellee Larkin was the prosecuting attorney.  On October 6, 1987, Waters obtained a written transcript of police and fire department communication logs concerning the Dorchester fire.  After examining the transcript, Waters concluded that the police officers had perjured themselves at this trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In August 1990, he filed a motion for a new trial in state court on the basis of this alleged perjury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant suit was commenced on August 26, 1992, in the Middlesex County Superior Court, after Waters had obtained am audio transmission of the police and fire department communications on the night of the arson.  Liberally construed, the suit alleges violations of state and federal civil rights laws, M.G.L. c.12, Sec. 11I;  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 et. seq., and other tortious conduct by police officers, an unidentified bystander and the prosecuting attorney.  Waters sought declaratory, injunctive and damage relief.  On October 15, 1992, appellee Gaddy removed the suit to the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1441(b).  The court granted the motion to dismiss of appellee officers on the ground that \"the action was filed after the statute of limitations had run.\"  The motion to dismiss of appellee Assistant District Attorney Larkin was granted on the grounds that he possessed absolute immunity from suit and that the statute of limitations had run.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of Waters' claims is subject to a three year statute of limitations.  Massachusetts law provides that both actions arising out of alleged violations of civil rights, M.G.L. c.260, Sec. 5B, and actions sounding in tort, M.G.L. c.260, Sec. 2A, must be commenced within three years next after the cause of action accrues.  The same limit applies to claims under the Massachusetts Torts Claim Act.  M.G.L. c.258, Sec. 4. Since the federal civil rights statute has no specific period of limitation, the court is required to apply the period of limitation of the most appropriate or analogous state statute.  Goodman v.

We do not agree.  Waters admits in his complaint that in October 1987 he received the written transcript of the conversation which he later heard on the tape and that \"[t]his transcript showed [him] that the testimony of Defendants Gaddy, Gonzales, Kelly, and Ronan was false, and known to them to be false.\"  Complaint para. 39.  Plaintiff also admits that on the basis of this evidence, he filed a motion for a new trial in state court.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> para. 40. </a></span> The only new information added by the audio tape was the identification of the voices of the officers, who are identified on the written transcript only by number.  Waters alleges that the audio tape indicates that the original description was broadcast not by Officer Gaddy, as she testified at trial, but by Officer Gonzalez.  Nevertheless, Waters also alleges that the written transcript already provided the evidence that Officer Gaddy had perjured herself in claiming to have broadcast the second, more accurate description.  Thus, even if, as Waters claims, the audio transcript provided further confirmation of the alleged perjury, Waters by his own admission was already aware in October 1987 of sufficient facts to give him reason to know that he had been harmed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera-Muriente,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2039745\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bowen,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2039745/bowen-v-eli-lilly-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> at <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 557 N.E.2d at 741.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's cause of action accrued at the latest in October 1987.
