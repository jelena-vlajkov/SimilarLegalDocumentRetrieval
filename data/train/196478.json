He was charged in count one with conspiracy to distribute\r\n\ncocaine base (or \"crack\") in violation of 21 U.S.C.   846, and in\r\n\ncounts  two and three with distributing cocaine base on April 22,\r\n\n1993 and  May 12, 1993, in  violation of 21  U.S.C.   841(a)(1).1\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Section 841(a)(1) provides that:\r\n\n            Except as authorized by  this subchapter,\r\n            it  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  person\r\n            knowingly or intentionally--(1) to .  . .\r\n            distribute .  . . or possess  with intent\r\n            to .  . . distribute  . . .  a controlled\r\n            substance . . . .\r\n\nSection 846 provides that:\r\n\n            Any person who  attempts or conspires  to\r\n            commit  any  offense   defined  in   this\r\n            subchapter [including    841(a)(1)] shall\r\n            be subject to the same penalties as those\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nOn October 4, 1993, Camilo pled guilty to count three pursuant to\r\n\na  written plea agreement, and counts one and two were dismissed.\r\n\nFor count three, Camilo was  sentenced on January 3, 1994 to  ten\r\n\nyears  of  imprisonment and  five  years  of supervised  release.\r\n\nCamilo appealed this sentence,  and on August 8, 1994,  the Court\r\n\nremanded this  case for resentencing pursuant to the agreement of\r\n\nboth parties at oral argument, based primarily on a change in the\r\n\nsentencing recommendation  policy of the United  States Probation\r\n\nOffice pertaining to   841(b) penalties.  See 21 U.S.C.    841(b)\r                                                       \r\n\n(specifying penalties for 21 U.S.C.   841(a) violations).  In the\r\n\nwake of United  States v.  Darmand, 3  F.3d 1578,  1581 (2d  Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1993),  the Probation  Office  accordingly recommended  that  the\r\n\nmandatory minimum sentences  under 21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1) be based\r\n\nonly  on  the  drug  quantities  involved  in   the  offenses  of\r\n\nconviction.\r\n\n          At Camilo's  resentencing hearing  on May 2,  1995, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  assessed  Camilo  with two  additional  criminal\r\n\nhistory points because, at the time that he committed the instant\r\n\noffense,  he  had  an  outstanding Massachusetts  warrant  for  a\r\n\nprobation violation.   Camilo challenges this  decision as error.\r\n\nAdditionally, Camilo argues that because cocaine powder and crack\r\n\nare   scientifically  identical,  the  United  States  Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines' (\"the Guidelines'\") distinction between the two forms\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            prescribed    for   the    offense,   the\r\n            commission of which was the object of the\r\n            attempt or conspiracy.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof  cocaine  produces  statutory ambiguity.    Therefore,  argues\r\n\nCamilo,  under the rule of lenity,2 he should receive the lighter\r\n\npenalty for  cocaine powder rather  than the heavier  penalty for\r\n\ncrack,   the  substance  which  he   was  in  fact  convicted  of\r\n\ndistributing.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          A.

The  rule is a background\r\nprinciple  which casts the decisive  vote when all  else fails to\r\nbring  sufficient lucidity  to the  meaning  of a  penal statute.\r\nGibbens, 25 F.3d at 35.\r                 \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nCommission,  Guidelines  Manual,     4A1.1(d)  (1994).    Section\r                                         \r\n\n4A1.2(m) defines  the effect under    4A1.1(d) of  an outstanding\r\n\nwarrant for a probation violation as follows:\r\n\n            For  the  purposes   of     4A1.1(d),   a\r\n            defendant who commits the instant offense\r\n            while  a violation  warrant from  a prior\r\n            sentence   is    outstanding   (e.g.,   a\r                                                          \r\n            probation, parole,  or supervised release\r\n            violation warrant) shall be deemed  to be\r                                                               \r\n            under a criminal justice sentence for the\r                                                       \r\n            purposes  of  this   provision  if   that\r\n            sentence is otherwise countable,  even if\r\n            that sentence would  have expired  absent\r\n            such a warrant.\r\n\n  4A1.2(m) (emphasis added); see also   4A1.1(d), comment.  (n.4)\r                                               \r\n\n(explaining the effect of a violation warrant \"[f]or the purposes\r\n\nof  [  4A1.1(d)]\" in language almost identical to the above block\r\n\nquote).\r\n\n          We  conclude, and  Camilo  does not  dispute, that  the\r\n\nsentence  of two  years' probation  which the evidence  shows was\r\n\nimposed on him on  June 28, 1989 was \"otherwise  countable\" under\r\n\n  4A1.1(d).3  Section 4A1.1(d) specifically  includes \"probation\"\r\n\nas a  \"criminal justice  sentence\" triggering the  additional two\r\n\npoints.  Furthermore,    4A1.2(m) clearly  indicates that, for   \r\n\n4A1.1(d)  purposes, an  outstanding  violation warrant  is to  be\r\n\nconsidered the equivalent of  the criminal justice sentence under\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  The words \"otherwise countable\" in   4A1.2(m) appear to  refer\r\nexclusively  to the  fact  that certain  enumerated offenses  are\r\nexcluded  for the  purposes  of    4A1.1(d).   These  exceptions,\r\nexplained in    4A1.2(c)-(j),  do not apply in the  instant case.\r\nSee,  e.g.,       4A1.2(c)  (entitled   \"Sentences  Counted   and\r                    \r\nExcluded\");    4A1.2(i) (\"Sentences  resulting from  tribal court\r\nconvictions  are  not  counted\");     4A1.2(j)  (\"Sentences   for\r\nexpunged convictions are not counted\").\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nwhich  it  issued, even  if  that sentence  would  otherwise have\r\n\nexpired absent such warrant.\r\n\n          Given the clarity of the relevant Guidelines, the issue\r\n\nwould  seem to  hinge simply  on whether  an  outstanding warrant\r\n\nexisted, and  the evidence supports the  district court's finding\r\n\nthat it did.   Sufficient evidence supports the district  court's\r\n\nconclusion that the outstanding warrant in question was issued on\r\n\nMay  2, 1991, almost  two months before  Camilo's probation would\r\n\nhave expired.   However, Camilo argues that  the required inquiry\r\n\nis  not so simple.  First, citing precedents from other circuits,\r\n\nhe contends that the government must show  that, under the law of\r\n\nthe prior sentence's origin (here, Massachusetts), the warrant is\r\n\nnot stale and  the issuing court  retains jurisdiction to  revoke\r\n\nthe  defendant's probation.  See  United States v.  Lee, 941 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n571,  572-73 (7th  Cir. 1991)  (discussing Missouri  law); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Baty,  931 F.2d  8, 10-11 (5th  Cir. 1991)  (discussing\r                        \r\n\nTexas  law).   Second, Camilo  asserts that,  under Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw,  the outstanding  warrant  was invalid  for  the purpose  of\r\n\nadditional criminal history points, because the government failed\r\n\nto present evidence  that it made reasonable  attempts to execute\r\n\nthe warrant.\r\n\n          We reject Camilo's proposition, which he contends to be\r\n\nthe law in the  Fifth and Seventh Circuits, that  the Guidelines'\r\n\notherwise unambiguous direction  is necessarily  qualified by  an\r\n\nadditional showing under  state law.   We decline  to follow  the\r\n\ncited  cases because both cases were decided before the effective\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ndate  of Amendment 381 to the Guidelines, November 1, 1991, which\r\n\nadded both    4A1.2(m),  discussed above,  and    4A1.1, comment.\r\n\n(n.4).4  See  USSG App. C, pp. 261-62, 264  (Nov. 1994); Lee, 941\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  at 571  (decided  August 26,  1991);  Baty, 931  F.2d  at 8\r                                                          \r\n\n(decided  April  26,  1991).    Not  surprisingly,  neither  case\r\n\nmentions either   4A1.2(m) or   4A1.1, comment.

In  that case, the Eighth  Circuit stated that whether  a\r\n\ndefendant  was under a criminal justice  offense was ultimately a\r\n\nmatter of federal law:\r\n\n            Although  we  agree  that  state  law  is\r\n            relevant to the  question before us,  our\r\n            ultimate  task  is  to determine  whether\r\n            [the  defendant]  was 'under'  a criminal\r\n            justice  sentence  for   purposes  of    \r\n            4A1.1(d).

(n.4).   The Sentencing  Commission may\r\nhave  intended   the  application   note  as  a   post-sentencing\r\nclarifying  amendment to guide  courts reviewing sentences handed\r\ndown  before  November  1,  1991,  while     4A1.2(m), an  actual\r\nGuideline,  was intended to compel  the result we  reach here for\r\nsentences dating from after November 1, 1991.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthat the defendant is sentenced\").  Most importantly,    4A1.2(m)\r\n\nis not an application note but a Guideline definition; as such it\r\n\nis  not merely persuasive, but  is in fact  binding authority for\r\n\nour interpretation of   4A1.1(d).\r\n\n          Given  that  the  plain   language  of     4A1.2(m)  is\r\n\nmandatory for our purposes,  and that both federal and  state law\r\n\nanalyses lead us to  the same conclusions, we therefore  need not\r\n\ndetermine  here which analysis --  federal or state  -- is indeed\r\n\nrequired.  Thus, as the court in Renfrew did before us, we follow\r                                                  \r\n\nboth lines of analysis without determining whether the state  law\r\n\ninquiry is mandatory.\r\n\n          We turn first  to federal law.  As  a matter of federal\r\n\nlaw,  it  may be  argued  that  a delay  in  the  execution of  a\r\n\nviolation  warrant  may be  so  unreasonable  that the  defendant\r\n\ncannot  be said  to  be under  a  criminal justice  sentence  for\r\n\npurposes  of    4A1.1(d).7   We need  not decide  whether such  a\r\n\nreasonableness requirement exists in this  case, however, because\r\n\nunder the  facts of this case  it would not benefit  Camilo.  The\r\n\nargument  described  above would  not  apply where  the  delay is\r\n\nattributable in significant part  to the defendant's own wrongful\r\n\nactions.   Cf. United  States v. Fisher,  895 F.2d 208,  211 (5th\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1990); United States v. Hill, 719  F.2d 1402, 1405 (9th Cir.\r                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  It has been  held that jurisdiction over a  probation violator\r\nin the federal system generally does not extend indefinitely once\r\na valid warrant is issued.   See United States v. Hill,  719 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n1402, 1404 (9th Cir. 1983).  Due process  requires that a warrant\r\nfor a  probation violation be  executed within a  reasonable time\r\nafter  issuance.   See id.  at 1405.   A similar  requirement may\r                                    \r\nexist under   4A1.1(m).\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n1983)  (considering  it  important  that the  defendant  had  not\r\n\ncontributed to the delay).  As the record shows, such is the case\r\n\nhere.\r\n\n          After Camilo was defaulted  on his probation in January\r\n\n1991,  notice  of  surrender  was  sent  to Camilo's  last  known\r\n\naddress,  42  East  Haverhill  Street,  Lawrence,  Massachusetts,\r\n\ninforming him of  a March 27,  1991 probation violation  hearing.\r\n\nThat hearing was  continued until May 2, 1991.   It is undisputed\r\n\nthat Camilo  failed to show up  for the May 2,  1991 hearing, and\r\n\nthe  district  court properly  found that  he  had notice  of the\r\n\nhearing.   Camilo  also failed  an April  17, 1991  court-ordered\r\n\nurinalysis and was  ordered to pay the testing  fee and to report\r\n\nfor another urinalysis at the testing site.  He failed to show up\r\n\nfor the second urinalysis.  When the warrant was issued following\r\n\nthe May 2, 1991 default, the Essex County Probation Office, which\r\n\nstill  had  an  address for  Camilo  in  Lawrence, forwarded  the\r\n\nwarrant  to  the   Lawrence  Police  Department  for   execution.\r\n\nHowever, Camilo  had moved  to Salem,  New Hampshire  sometime in\r\n\n1990  but had  never notified the  Essex County  Probation Office\r\n\nthat he had left the state.  During this time Camilo also  used a\r\n\nnumber  of  aliases,  including \"Chicky,\"  \"Angel  Castillo,\" and\r\n\n\"Blas Alberto Camilo Caraballo.\"   The facts of record  show that\r\n\nCamilo simply made himself scarce during the time the warrant was\r\n\noutstanding.  For these reasons, therefore, Camilo cannot benefit\r\n\nfrom any putative staleness of the warrant.  See Fisher, 895 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 211; Hill, 719 F.2d at 1405.\r                      \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          Even assuming that such an inquiry is necessary, Camilo\r\n\nalso cannot avail himself of  Massachusetts state law.  Recently,\r\n\nthe  Supreme Judicial Court recently stated  that, in the context\r\n\nof determining the  fairness of the  revocation of a  defendant's\r\n\nparole,  one consideration is  \"the extent  to which  the parolee\r\n\nreasonably relied on the  inaction of the enforcing authorities.\"\r\n\nIn  re Zullo,  653 N.E.2d  150, 152,  420  Mass. 872,  876 (Mass.\r                      \r\n\n1995).  As noted  above, Camilo could not reasonably  have relied\r\n\non  the  inaction of  the enforcing  authorities.   He  failed to\r\n\nappear at  a hearing of which  he had notice.   Moreover, his own\r\n\nactions in  leaving the state  without notification and  in using\r\n\naliases  thwarted the  Essex  County Probation  Office's and  the\r\n\nLawrence Police Department's attempts to contact him.\r\n\n          Upon  review  for clear  error,  we  conclude that  the\r\n\ndistrict court  received sufficient evidence to  find that Camilo\r\n\nhad a probation violation warrant outstanding.  Under our de novo\r\n\nreview of the Guidelines,  we hold that regardless of  whether we\r\n\nmust  focus on    4A1.2(m)  or Massachusetts  state law,  we must\r\n\naffirm the district court's criminal history computation.\r\n\n          B.  The Distinction Between Crack and Cocaine Powder\r                    B.  The Distinction Between Crack and Cocaine Powder\r\n\n          Camilo  also argues  that the  district court  erred in\r\n\ndenying  his motion  for a  downward departure  pursuant  to USSG\r\n\n  5K2.0 and 18 U.S.C.   3553(b).  Camilo's argument comprises two\r\n\nparts, each of which is essential to success.  First, he contends\r\n\nthat the  district court  improperly construed its  discretion to\r\n\ndepart  downward, and  thus its  decision  to deny  the departure\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nshould be subject to  plenary review on appeal.8   Second, Camilo\r\n\ncontends that a departure was warranted because the United States\r\n\nSentencing  Commission (the  \"Sentencing  Commission\") failed  to\r\n\ncomply  with  its  enabling  legislation9  by adopting  Congress'\r\n\npreviously   established  100-to-1   ratio  in   the  Guidelines'\r\n\nmandatory  minimum penalties for cocaine distribution, U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n2D1.1, without fully  investigating the circumstances  underlying\r\n\nthe ratio.\r\n\n          However,  we  need  not  dwell on  the  first  part  of\r\n\nCamilo's argument.  Even  assuming, arguendo, that plenary review\r\n\napplies,  we reject  the  equally crucial  second  part.   Camilo\r\n\nasserts  that a  recently  released Sentencing  Commission report\r\n\ndisapproving the  100-to-1 ratio  constitutes  a tacit  admission\r\n\nthat  the Sentencing Commission was derelict in its duty.

Furthermore,  Camilo\r                                          \r\n\nbolsters this  argument by noting that  the Sentencing Commission\r\n\nvoted  on April 13, 1995,10  to eliminate the  distinction in the\r\n\nGuidelines between \"crack\" and  \"powder\" cocaine, and recommended\r\n\nto  Congress that  it  revise the  statutory penalty  distinction\r\n\nbetween the  two forms  of cocaine.   See  60  Fed. Reg.  25,074,\r                                                   \r\n\n25,075-76 (1995).  The  Sentencing Commission concluded that \"the\r\n\n[G]uideline provisions, as amended, will better take into account\r\n\nthe increased  harms associated with some  crack cocaine offenses\r\n\nand,  thus, the different offense levels based solely on the form\r\n\nof cocaine are not  required.\"  Id.  Camilo  asserts that because\r                                             \r\n\n\"crack\" and \"powder\" cocaine are \"synonymous\"  in the  scientific\r\n\nand  medical communities  (his prospective  defense witness  is a\r\n\nmedical doctor),  the  Guidelines' distinction  between  them  is\r\n\nambiguous, and  therefore the  rule  of lenity  mandates that  he\r\n\nreceive  the lesser penalty.  For legal support, Camilo relies on\r\n\nUnited States v.  Davis, 864 F. Supp. 1303, 1309 (N.D. Ga. 1994).\r                                 \r\n\nOn  these grounds,  argues Camilo,  the district  court  erred by\r\n\ndenying his \"Motion for Services Other than  Counsel\" and \"Motion\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10   See 28 U.S.C.   994(p) (providing that Sentencing Commission\r                  \r\namendments  are to  take effect  upon a  certain date,  unless an\r\nintervening Act of Congress rejects them).  \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nto Continue,\" thereby precluding  Camilo from presenting evidence\r\n\nthat \"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" are scientifically identical.\r\n\n          For  two reasons,  we  reject the  contention that  the\r\n\nSentencing  Commission's  acts  or  omissions  compel a  downward\r\n\ndeparture  for Camilo, and thus  we also reject  any argument for\r\n\nexpert testimony based on this theory.  First, the rule of lenity\r\n\nargument fails for essentially the same  reason that this circuit\r\n\npreviously  rejected  the  argument  that  scientific equivalence\r\n\nrequires  that crack  offenders be  given the  same sentences  as\r\n\nthose  who   traffic  in  cocaine  powder.

Id.   The\r                                                                     \r\n\nsimilar  medical  effects from  crack and  cocaine powder  do not\r\n\ncompel  a finding of  legal ambiguity, especially  where there is\r\n\nevidence of differing effects on society.\r\n\n          Second, in light of recent legislative developments  we\r\n\nconclude that  the Sentencing Commission  cannot be said  to have\r\n\nfailed  in  its statutory  duty  to  investigate the  distinction\r\n\nbetween  crack and cocaine powder.  In response to the Sentencing\r\n\nCommission's April  13, 1995  vote, the House  of Representatives\r\n\njoined the Senate  on October  18, 1995 in  voting to retain  the\r\n\ncurrent  mandatory  sentence  for  possession  of crack  cocaine,\r\n\nmaintaining  disparate sentences  for  crack and  powder  cocaine\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\npossession.

These actions preempt the Sentencing Commission's\r                        \r\n\nApril  13, 1995  decision  to eliminate  the distinction  between\r\n\ncrack  and cocaine powder from taking effect on November 1, 1995.\r\n\nSee 28 U.S.C.   994(p).

In United States v. Camilo, 30 F.3d 126 (1st Cir.1994), this court affirmed his convictions for violations of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a) and Sec. 846 pursuant to a final judgment entered on January 3, 1994 by the district court, and remanded for the resentencing that is the origin of this appeal.  For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, which are derived from the presentence investigation reports as well as the oral and documentary evidence introduced at the sentencing and resentencing hearings, are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camilo was indicted with two co-defendants on July 2, 1993.  He was charged in count one with conspiracy to distribute cocaine base (or \"crack\") in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846, and in counts two and three with distributing cocaine base on April 22, 1993 and May 12, 1993, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On October 4, 1993, Camilo pled guilty to count three pursuant to a written plea agreement, and counts one and two were dismissed.  For count three, Camilo was sentenced on January 3, 1994 to ten years of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.  Camilo appealed this sentence, and on August 8, 1994, the Court remanded this case for resentencing pursuant to the agreement of both parties at oral argument, based primarily on a change in the sentencing recommendation policy of the United States Probation Office pertaining to Sec. 841(b) penalties.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b) (specifying penalties for 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a) violations).  In the wake of United States v. Darmand, 3 F.3d 1578, 1581 (2d Cir.1993), the Probation Office accordingly recommended that the mandatory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1) be based only on the drug quantities involved in the offenses of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Camilo's resentencing hearing on May 2, 1995, the district court assessed Camilo with two additional criminal history points because, at the time that he committed the instant offense, he had an outstanding Massachusetts warrant for a probation violation.  Camilo challenges this decision as error.  Additionally, Camilo argues that because cocaine powder and crack are scientifically identical, the United States Sentencing Guidelines' (\"the Guidelines' \") distinction between the two forms of cocaine produces statutory ambiguity.  Therefore, argues Camilo, under the rule of lenity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> he should receive the lighter penalty for cocaine powder rather than the heavier penalty for crack, the substance which he was in fact convicted of distributing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Criminal History Computation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's legal interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, United States v. Fontana, 50 F.3d 86, 87 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 221 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1322, 131 L.Ed.2d 202 (1995), and its fact-bound determinations of defendant's actions with respect to the offense for clear error.  Fontana, 50 F.3d at 87;  Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d at 225.   Furthermore, the government carries the burden of showing the facts necessary to justify additional criminal history points.  United States v. Roberts, 39 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines specify that, in determining the Criminal History Category, the sentencing court shall add two points to a defendant's criminal history category \"if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation.\"   United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Sec. 4A1.1(d) (1994).  Section 4A1.2(m) defines the effect under Sec. 4A1.1(d) of an outstanding warrant for a probation violation as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>For the purposes of Sec. 4A1.1(d), a defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding (e.g., a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of this provision if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such a warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 4A1.2(m) (emphasis added);  see also Sec. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4) (explaining the effect of a violation warrant \"[f]or the purposes of [Sec. 4A1.1(d) ]\" in language almost identical to the above block quote).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, and Camilo does not dispute, that the sentence of two years' probation which the evidence shows was imposed on him on June 28, 1989 was \"otherwise countable\" under Sec. 4A1.1(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Section 4A1.1(d) specifically includes \"probation\" as a \"criminal justice sentence\" triggering the additional two points.  Furthermore, Sec. 4A1.2(m) clearly indicates that, for Sec. 4A1.1(d) purposes, an outstanding violation warrant is to be considered the equivalent of the criminal justice sentence under which it issued, even if that sentence would otherwise have expired absent such warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the clarity of the relevant Guidelines, the issue would seem to hinge simply on whether an outstanding warrant existed, and the evidence supports the district court's finding that it did.  Sufficient evidence supports the district court's conclusion that the outstanding warrant in question was issued on May 2, 1991, almost two months before Camilo's probation would have expired.  However, Camilo argues that the required inquiry is not so simple.  First, citing precedents from other circuits, he contends that the government must show that, under the law of the prior sentence's origin (here, Massachusetts), the warrant is not stale and the issuing court retains jurisdiction to revoke the defendant's probation.  See United States v. Lee, 941 F.2d 571, 572-73 (7th Cir.1991) (discussing Missouri law);  United States v. Baty, 931 F.2d 8, 10-11 (5th Cir.1991) (discussing Texas law).  Second, Camilo asserts that, under Massachusetts law, the outstanding warrant was invalid for the purpose of additional criminal history points, because the government failed to present evidence that it made reasonable attempts to execute the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Camilo's proposition, which he contends to be the law in the Fifth and Seventh Circuits, that the Guidelines' otherwise unambiguous direction is necessarily qualified by an additional showing under state law.  We decline to follow the cited cases because both cases were decided before the effective date of Amendment 381 to the Guidelines, November 1, 1991, which added both Sec. 4A1.2(m), discussed above, and Sec. 4A1.1, comment.  (n. 4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See USSG App.  C, pp. 261-62, 264 (Nov. 1994);  Lee, 941 F.2d at 571 (decided August 26, 1991);  Baty, 931 F.2d at 8 (decided April 26, 1991).  Not surprisingly, neither case mentions either Sec. 4A1.2(m) or Sec. 4A1.1, comment.  (n. 4), which were to become effective on November 1 of 1991, the year in which both cases were decided.  Lee, 941 F.2d at 571;  Baty, 931 F.2d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, we follow the reasoning of a case not cited by either party, United States v. Renfrew, 957 F.2d 525 (8th Cir.1992).  In that case, the Eighth Circuit stated that whether a defendant was under a criminal justice offense was ultimately a matter of federal law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Although we agree that state law is relevant to the question before us, our ultimate task is to determine whether [the defendant] was 'under' a criminal justice sentence for purposes of Sec. 4A1.1(d).  That is a question of federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 526-27 (affirming the addition of two points to defendant's criminal history category based on either or both Minnesota law and Sec. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4)).  In Renfrew, the Eighth Circuit determined that regardless of whether it focused on Minnesota state law or on a Sentencing Commission \"postsentence clarifying amendment,\" see Sec. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4), the defendant was under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of Sec. 4A1.1(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the defendant in Renfrew, however, Camilo's sentencing date, as well as his offending conduct, was subsequent to November 1, 1991, the effective date of both Secs. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4) and 4A1.2(m).  As we have previously noted, the language of Sec. 4A1.2(m) that is relevant to our analysis almost perfectly replicates that of Sec. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4), which was relied upon by the court in Renfrew.   Unlike the court in Renfrew, we face no ex post facto problem in following Sec. 4A1.2(m) rather than the Sec. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(4) (courts should consider the kinds of sentence and sentencing range specified by the Guidelines \"that are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced\");  U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.11(a) (courts are to use \"the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced\").  Most importantly, Sec. 4A1.2(m) is not an application note but a Guideline definition;  as such it is not merely persuasive, but is in fact binding authority for our interpretation of Sec. 4A1.1(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the plain language of Sec. 4A1.2(m) is mandatory for our purposes, and that both federal and state law analyses lead us to the same conclusions, we therefore need not determine here which analysis--federal or state--is indeed required.  Thus, as the court in Renfrew did before us, we follow both lines of analysis without determining whether the state law inquiry is mandatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to federal law.  As a matter of federal law, it may be argued that a delay in the execution of a violation warrant may be so unreasonable that the defendant cannot be said to be under a criminal justice sentence for purposes of Sec. 4A1.1(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We need not decide whether such a reasonableness requirement exists in this case, however, because under the facts of this case it would not benefit Camilo.  The argument described above would not apply where the delay is attributable in significant part to the defendant's own wrongful actions.  Cf. United States v. Fisher, 895 F.2d 208, 211 (5th Cir.1990);  United States v. Hill, 719 F.2d 1402, 1405 (9th Cir.1983) (considering it important that the defendant had not contributed to the delay).  As the record shows, such is the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Camilo was defaulted on his probation in January 1991, notice of surrender was sent to Camilo's last known address, 42 East Haverhill Street, Lawrence, Massachusetts, informing him of a March 27, 1991 probation violation hearing.  That hearing was continued until May 2, 1991.  It is undisputed that Camilo failed to show up for the May 2, 1991 hearing, and the district court properly found that he had notice of the hearing.  Camilo also failed an April 17, 1991 court-ordered urinalysis and was ordered to pay the testing fee and to report for another urinalysis at the testing site.  He failed to show up for the second urinalysis.  When the warrant was issued following the May 2, 1991 default, the Essex County Probation Office, which still had an address for Camilo in Lawrence, forwarded the warrant to the Lawrence Police Department for execution.  However, Camilo had moved to Salem, New Hampshire sometime in 1990 but had never notified the Essex County Probation Office that he had left the state.  During this time Camilo also used a number of aliases, including \"Chicky,\" \"Angel Castillo,\" and \"Blas Alberto Camilo Caraballo.\"   The facts of record show that Camilo simply made himself scarce during the time the warrant was outstanding.  For these reasons, therefore, Camilo cannot benefit from any putative staleness of the warrant.  See Fisher, 895 F.2d at 211;  Hill, 719 F.2d at 1405.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that such an inquiry is necessary, Camilo also cannot avail himself of Massachusetts state law.  Recently, the Supreme Judicial Court stated that, in the context of determining the fairness of the revocation of a defendant's parole, one consideration is \"the extent to which the parolee reasonably relied on the inaction of the enforcing authorities.\"  In re Zullo, 420 Mass. 872, 876, 653 N.E.2d 150, 152 (1995).  As noted above, Camilo could not reasonably have relied on the inaction of the enforcing authorities.  He failed to appear at a hearing of which he had notice.  Moreover, his own actions in leaving the state without notification and in using aliases thwarted the Essex County Probation Office's and the Lawrence Police Department's attempts to contact him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon review for clear error, we conclude that the district court received sufficient evidence to find that Camilo had a probation violation warrant outstanding.  Under our de novo review of the Guidelines, we hold that regardless of whether we must focus on Sec. 4A1.2(m) or Massachusetts state law, we must affirm the district court's criminal history computation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Distinction Between Crack and Cocaine Powder</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camilo also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure pursuant to USSG Sec. 5K2.0 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b).  Camilo's argument comprises two parts, each of which is essential to success.  First, he contends that the district court improperly construed its discretion to depart downward, and thus its decision to deny the departure should be subject to plenary review on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Second, Camilo contends that a departure was warranted because the United States Sentencing Commission (the \"Sentencing Commission\") failed to comply with its enabling legislation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> by adopting Congress' previously established 100-to-1 ratio in the Guidelines' mandatory minimum penalties for cocaine distribution, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1, without fully investigating the circumstances underlying the ratio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we need not dwell on the first part of Camilo's argument.  Even assuming, arguendo, that plenary review applies, we reject the equally crucial second part.  Camilo asserts that a recently released Sentencing Commission report disapproving the 100-to-1 ratio constitutes a tacit admission that the Sentencing Commission was derelict in its duty.  United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to the Congress:  Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy (February 1995).  In that report, the Sentencing Commission \"firmly concludes that it cannot recommend a ratio differential as great as the current 100-to-1 quantity ratio.\"   Id. at 196.  Furthermore, Camilo bolsters this argument by noting that the Sentencing Commission voted on April 13, 1995,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> to eliminate the distinction in the Guidelines between \"crack\" and \"powder\" cocaine, and recommended to Congress that it revise the statutory penalty distinction between the two forms of cocaine.  See 60 Fed.Reg. 25,074, 25,075-76 (1995).  The Sentencing Commission concluded that \"the [G]uideline provisions, as amended, will better take into account the increased harms associated with some crack cocaine offenses and, thus, the different offense levels based solely on the form of cocaine are not required.\"   Id.  Camilo asserts that because \"crack\" and \"powder\" cocaine are \"synonymous\" in the scientific and medical communities (his prospective defense witness is a medical doctor), the Guidelines' distinction between them is ambiguous, and therefore the rule of lenity mandates that he receive the lesser penalty.  For legal support, Camilo relies on United States v. Davis, 864 F.Supp. 1303, 1309 (N.D.Ga.1994).  On these grounds, argues Camilo, the district court erred by denying his \"Motion for Services Other than Counsel\" and \"Motion to Continue,\" thereby precluding Camilo from presenting evidence that \"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" are scientifically identical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For two reasons, we reject the contention that the Sentencing Commission's acts or omissions compel a downward departure for Camilo, and thus we also reject any argument for expert testimony based on this theory.  First, the rule of lenity argument fails for essentially the same reason that this circuit previously rejected the argument that scientific equivalence requires that crack offenders be given the same sentences as those who traffic in cocaine powder.  United States v. Singleterry, 29 F.3d 733, 740 (1st Cir.1994).  In Singleterry, we concluded that health effects notwithstanding, crack in reality does differ from cocaine powder, not least importantly because its cheaper unit price could radically increase drug use absent stiffer penalties for crack distributors.  Id.  The similar medical effects from crack and cocaine powder do not compel a finding of legal ambiguity, especially where there is evidence of differing effects on society.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in light of recent legislative developments we conclude that the Sentencing Commission cannot be said to have failed in its statutory duty to investigate the distinction between crack and cocaine powder.  In response to the Sentencing Commission's April 13, 1995 vote, the House of Representatives joined the Senate on October 18, 1995 in voting to retain the current mandatory sentence for possession of crack cocaine, maintaining disparate sentences for crack and powder cocaine possession.  See Pub.L. No. 104-38, Sec. 1, 109 Stat. 334, 334 (1995).  And on October 30, 1995, the President signed this bill into law.  Id.  These actions preempt the Sentencing Commission's April 13, 1995 decision to eliminate the distinction between crack and cocaine powder from taking effect on November 1, 1995.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(p).  In light of the October rejection of the Sentencing Commission's April amendment, we cannot accept the argument that the Sentencing Commission was derelict in its duty to weigh penalties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision not to grant a continuance to permit the presentation of live testimony on the crack-cocaine powder issue.  See United States v. Claudio, 44 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1995) (reviewing for abuse of discretion district court's refusal to postpone sentencing to allow defendant's submission of live medical testimony).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 841(a)(1) provides that:</p>\n        <p>Except as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally--(1) to ... distribute ... or possess with intent to ... distribute ... a controlled substance....</p>\n        <p>Section 846 provides that:</p>\n        <p>Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter [including Sec. 841(a)(1) ] shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The rule of lenity mandates the resolution of ambiguities in a criminal statute favorably to the defendant.

He was charged in count one with conspiracy to distribute cocaine base (or \"crack\") in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846, and in counts two and three with distributing cocaine base on April 22, 1993 and May 12, 1993, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On October 4, 1993, Camilo pled guilty to count three pursuant to a written plea agreement, and counts one and two were dismissed.  For count three, Camilo was sentenced on January 3, 1994 to ten years of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.  Camilo appealed this sentence, and on August 8, 1994, the Court remanded this case for resentencing pursuant to the agreement of both parties at oral argument, based primarily on a change in the sentencing recommendation policy of the United States Probation Office pertaining to Sec. 841(b) penalties.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b) (specifying penalties for 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a) violations).  In the wake of United States v.

Camilo challenges this decision as error.  Additionally, Camilo argues that because cocaine powder and crack are scientifically identical, the United States Sentencing Guidelines' (\"the Guidelines' \") distinction between the two forms of cocaine produces statutory ambiguity.  Therefore, argues Camilo, under the rule of lenity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> he should receive the lighter penalty for cocaine powder rather than the heavier penalty for crack, the substance which he was in fact convicted of distributing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Section 4A1.2(m) defines the effect under Sec. 4A1.1(d) of an outstanding warrant for a probation violation as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>For the purposes of Sec. 4A1.1(d), a defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding (e.g., a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of this provision if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such a warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 4A1.2(m) (emphasis added);  see also Sec. 4A1.1(d), comment.

Furthermore, Sec. 4A1.2(m) clearly indicates that, for Sec. 4A1.1(d) purposes, an outstanding violation warrant is to be considered the equivalent of the criminal justice sentence under which it issued, even if that sentence would otherwise have expired absent such warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the clarity of the relevant Guidelines, the issue would seem to hinge simply on whether an outstanding warrant existed, and the evidence supports the district court's finding that it did.  Sufficient evidence supports the district court's conclusion that the outstanding warrant in question was issued on May 2, 1991, almost two months before Camilo's probation would have expired.  However, Camilo argues that the required inquiry is not so simple.  First, citing precedents from other circuits, he contends that the government must show that, under the law of the prior sentence's origin (here, Massachusetts), the warrant is not stale and the issuing court retains jurisdiction to revoke the defendant's probation.  See United States v. Lee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566374\"><a href=\"/opinion/566374/united-states-v-robert-a-lee-also-known-as-robert-a-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 572-73 (7th Cir.1991) (discussing Missouri law);  United States v.

Second, Camilo asserts that, under Massachusetts law, the outstanding warrant was invalid for the purpose of additional criminal history points, because the government failed to present evidence that it made reasonable attempts to execute the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Camilo's proposition, which he contends to be the law in the Fifth and Seventh Circuits, that the Guidelines' otherwise unambiguous direction is necessarily qualified by an additional showing under state law.  We decline to follow the cited cases because both cases were decided before the effective date of Amendment 381 to the Guidelines, November 1, 1991, which added both Sec. 4A1.2(m), discussed above, and Sec. 4A1.1, comment.  (n. 4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See USSG App.  C, pp. 261-62, 264 (Nov. 1994);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566374\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Lee,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/566374/united-states-v-robert-a-lee-also-known-as-robert-a-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">571</span> </a></span>(decided August 26, 1991);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559595\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Baty,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/559595/united-states-v-connie-manthei-baty/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">8</span> </a></span>(decided April 26, 1991).  Not surprisingly, neither case mentions either Sec. 4A1.2(m) or Sec. 4A1.1, comment.

(n. 4)).  In Renfrew, the Eighth Circuit determined that regardless of whether it focused on Minnesota state law or on a Sentencing Commission \"postsentence clarifying amendment,\" see Sec. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4), the defendant was under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of Sec. 4A1.1(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the defendant in Renfrew, however, Camilo's sentencing date, as well as his offending conduct, was subsequent to November 1, 1991, the effective date of both Secs. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4) and 4A1.2(m).  As we have previously noted, the language of Sec. 4A1.2(m) that is relevant to our analysis almost perfectly replicates that of Sec. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4), which was relied upon by the court in Renfrew.   Unlike the court in Renfrew, we face no ex post facto problem in following Sec. 4A1.2(m) rather than the Sec. 4A1.1(d), comment.  (n. 4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(4) (courts should consider the kinds of sentence and sentencing range specified by the Guidelines \"that are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced\");  U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.11(a) (courts are to use \"the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced\").  Most importantly, Sec. 4A1.2(m) is not an application note but a Guideline definition;  as such it is not merely persuasive, but is in fact binding authority for our interpretation of Sec. 4A1.1(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the plain language of Sec. 4A1.2(m) is mandatory for our purposes, and that both federal and state law analyses lead us to the same conclusions, we therefore need not determine here which analysis--federal or state--is indeed required.  Thus, as the court in Renfrew did before us, we follow both lines of analysis without determining whether the state law inquiry is mandatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to federal law.  As a matter of federal law, it may be argued that a delay in the execution of a violation warrant may be so unreasonable that the defendant cannot be said to be under a criminal justice sentence for purposes of Sec. 4A1.1(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We need not decide whether such a reasonableness requirement exists in this case, however, because under the facts of this case it would not benefit Camilo.  The argument described above would not apply where the delay is attributable in significant part to the defendant's own wrongful actions.  Cf. United States v. Fisher, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536064\"><a href=\"/opinion/536064/united-states-v-harold-leroy-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 211 (5th Cir.1990);  United States v.

As the record shows, such is the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Camilo was defaulted on his probation in January 1991, notice of surrender was sent to Camilo's last known address, 42 East Haverhill Street, Lawrence, Massachusetts, informing him of a March 27, 1991 probation violation hearing.  That hearing was continued until May 2, 1991.  It is undisputed that Camilo failed to show up for the May 2, 1991 hearing, and the district court properly found that he had notice of the hearing.  Camilo also failed an April 17, 1991 court-ordered urinalysis and was ordered to pay the testing fee and to report for another urinalysis at the testing site.  He failed to show up for the second urinalysis.  When the warrant was issued following the May 2, 1991 default, the Essex County Probation Office, which still had an address for Camilo in Lawrence, forwarded the warrant to the Lawrence Police Department for execution.  However, Camilo had moved to Salem, New Hampshire sometime in 1990 but had never notified the Essex County Probation Office that he had left the state.  During this time Camilo also used a number of aliases, including \"Chicky,\" \"Angel Castillo,\" and \"Blas Alberto Camilo Caraballo.\"   The facts of record show that Camilo simply made himself scarce during the time the warrant was outstanding.  For these reasons, therefore, Camilo cannot benefit from any putative staleness of the warrant.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536064\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fisher,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/536064/united-states-v-harold-leroy-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"426296\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hill,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/426296/united-states-v-donald-a-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">719</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1405</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that such an inquiry is necessary, Camilo also cannot avail himself of Massachusetts state law.  Recently, the Supreme Judicial Court stated that, in the context of determining the fairness of the revocation of a defendant's parole, one consideration is \"the extent to which the parolee reasonably relied on the inaction of the enforcing authorities.\"  In re Zullo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></span>, 876, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></span>, 152 (1995).  As noted above, Camilo could not reasonably have relied on the inaction of the enforcing authorities.  He failed to appear at a hearing of which he had notice.  Moreover, his own actions in leaving the state without notification and in using aliases thwarted the Essex County Probation Office's and the Lawrence Police Department's attempts to contact him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon review for clear error, we conclude that the district court received sufficient evidence to find that Camilo had a probation violation warrant outstanding.  Under our de novo review of the Guidelines, we hold that regardless of whether we must focus on Sec. 4A1.2(m) or Massachusetts state law, we must affirm the district court's criminal history computation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Distinction Between Crack and Cocaine Powder</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Camilo also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure pursuant to USSG Sec. 5K2.0 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b).  Camilo's argument comprises two parts, each of which is essential to success.  First, he contends that the district court improperly construed its discretion to depart downward, and thus its decision to deny the departure should be subject to plenary review on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Second, Camilo contends that a departure was warranted because the United States Sentencing Commission (the \"Sentencing Commission\") failed to comply with its enabling legislation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> by adopting Congress' previously established 100-to-1 ratio in the Guidelines' mandatory minimum penalties for cocaine distribution, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1, without fully investigating the circumstances underlying the ratio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we need not dwell on the first part of Camilo's argument.  Even assuming, arguendo, that plenary review applies, we reject the equally crucial second part.  Camilo asserts that a recently released Sentencing Commission report disapproving the 100-to-1 ratio constitutes a tacit admission that the Sentencing Commission was derelict in its duty.  United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to the Congress:  Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy (February 1995).  In that report, the Sentencing Commission \"firmly concludes that it cannot recommend a ratio differential as great as the current 100-to-1 quantity ratio.\"   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 196. </span> Furthermore, Camilo bolsters this argument by noting that the Sentencing Commission voted on April 13, 1995,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> to eliminate the distinction in the Guidelines between \"crack\" and \"powder\" cocaine, and recommended to Congress that it revise the statutory penalty distinction between the two forms of cocaine.  See 60 Fed.Reg. 25,074, 25,075-76 (1995).  The Sentencing Commission concluded that \"the [G]uideline provisions, as amended, will better take into account the increased harms associated with some crack cocaine offenses and, thus, the different offense levels based solely on the form of cocaine are not required.\"   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Camilo asserts </span>that because \"crack\" and \"powder\" cocaine are \"synonymous\" in the scientific and medical communities (his prospective defense witness is a medical doctor), the Guidelines' distinction between them is ambiguous, and therefore the rule of lenity mandates that he receive the lesser penalty.  For legal support, Camilo relies on United States v. Davis, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></span>, 1309 (N.D.Ga.1994).  On these grounds, argues Camilo, the district court erred by denying his \"Motion for Services Other than Counsel\" and \"Motion to Continue,\" thereby precluding Camilo from presenting evidence that \"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" are scientifically identical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For two reasons, we reject the contention that the Sentencing Commission's acts or omissions compel a downward departure for Camilo, and thus we also reject any argument for expert testimony based on this theory.  First, the rule of lenity argument fails for essentially the same reason that this circuit previously rejected the argument that scientific equivalence requires that crack offenders be given the same sentences as those who traffic in cocaine powder.  United States v. Singleterry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674592\"><a href=\"/opinion/674592/united-states-v-daryl-e-singleterry/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span>, 740 (1st Cir.1994).  In Singleterry, we concluded that health effects notwithstanding, crack in reality does differ from cocaine powder, not least importantly because its cheaper unit price could radically increase drug use absent stiffer penalties for crack distributors.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674592\"><a href=\"/opinion/674592/united-states-v-daryl-e-singleterry/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The similar </a></span>medical effects from crack and cocaine powder do not compel a finding of legal ambiguity, especially where there is evidence of differing effects on society.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in light of recent legislative developments we conclude that the Sentencing Commission cannot be said to have failed in its statutory duty to investigate the distinction between crack and cocaine powder.  In response to the Sentencing Commission's April 13, 1995 vote, the House of Representatives joined the Senate on October 18, 1995 in voting to retain the current mandatory sentence for possession of crack cocaine, maintaining disparate sentences for crack and powder cocaine possession.  See Pub.L. No. 104-38, Sec. 1, 109 Stat. 334, 334 (1995).  And on October 30, 1995, the President signed this bill into law.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674592\"><a href=\"/opinion/674592/united-states-v-daryl-e-singleterry/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  These actions </a></span>preempt the Sentencing Commission's April 13, 1995 decision to eliminate the distinction between crack and cocaine powder from taking effect on November 1, 1995.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(p).  In light of the October rejection of the Sentencing Commission's April amendment, we cannot accept the argument that the Sentencing Commission was derelict in its duty to weigh penalties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision not to grant a continuance to permit the presentation of live testimony on the crack-cocaine powder issue.
