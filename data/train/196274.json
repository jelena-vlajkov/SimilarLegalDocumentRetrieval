Defendant-appellant  Wilson  Ocampo  pled\r                            \r\n\nguilty  to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, see\r                                                                         \r\n\n21  U.S.C.      841(a)(1),  846, and  was  sentenced  to  the\r\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum term of 120 months' imprisonment,\r\n\nsee  21  U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(A).   After  the change  of plea\r               \r\n\nhearing but  before sentencing, Congress enacted  18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n3553(f),  which  allows certain  low-level,  non-violent drug\r\n\noffenders  with  little  or  no  criminal  history  to  avoid\r\n\nmandatory minimum sentences.  See United States v. Rodriguez,\r                                                                        \r\n\n1995  WL 431015  at *1 (5th  Cir. July  21, 1995).   The sole\r\n\nissue raised  by this  appeal is whether  the district  court\r\n\nerred in failing to  consider Ocampo's eligibility for relief\r\n\nunder    3553(f)  and the  related guideline  provision which\r\n\napplies the statute, U.S.S.G.   5C1.2.  \r\n\n     Since Ocampo failed to ask the sentencing court to apply\r\n\n  5C1.2, the  \"plain error\"  standard applies.   See Fed.  R.\r                                                                \r\n\nCrim.  P. 52(b);  United States  v. Olano,  113 S.  Ct. 1770,\r                                                     \r\n\n1776-79 (1993) (discussing plain error review); United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d  1, 5 (1st Cir.  1993) (same).   The\r                           \r\n\n120-month sentence  imposed by the district  court was within\r\n\nOcampo's  guideline range  of  108-135 months'  imprisonment.\r\n\nBased on our review of the  record, however, it appears as if\r\n\nthe  court  may  have   been  unaware  of  the  newly-adopted\r\n\nguideline provision  and mistakenly believed  that it  lacked\r\n\nany source of  authority to impose  a lesser sentence  within\r\r\n\nthe  applicable  guideline  range.    Cf.  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nMcAndrews, 12 F.3d  273, 276 n.2 (1st Cir.  1993) (discussing\r                     \r\n\ncircumstances   under  which   appellate  court   may  review\r\n\ndiscretionary decision not to depart).  \r\n\n     Strictly  speaking,  it  is  not \"plain  error\"  in  the\r\n\nliteral  sense  for  a  district  court  to  ignore a  relief\r\n\nprovision where the provision's  application depends upon the\r\n\nshowing  of  specific  facts,  where  the  burden is  on  the\r\n\ndefendant to  adduce those facts, and where the defendant has\r\n\nfailed to do so.  But in criminal cases we  have authority to\r\n\nnotice  possible defects,  whether or  not evident,  to avoid\r\n\ninjustice;  and in this case  it is quite  possible that both\r\n\nthe defendant and the court were unfamiliar with the recently\r\n\nadopted relief provision.   Cf. United States  v. Collins, 60\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 4, 7 (1st Cir. 1995).  Under the circumstances, we think\r\n\nthat justice  would be  served by  vacating the sentence  and\r\n\nremanding  in  order  to  permit the  defendant  to  make the\r\n\nrequired showing, if he can.  Accordingly, we vacate Ocampo's\r\n\nsentence and remand the  case so that the district  court can\r\n\ndecide whether the conditions of   5C1.2 are met.\r\n\n     Vacated and remanded.  See Loc. R. 27.1.  \r                                           \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
