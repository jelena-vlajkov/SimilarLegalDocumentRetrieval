The  district  court  denied the  writ.\r\n\nHaving reviewed the record de novo, Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1, 8 (1st Cir.  1994), cert. denied,     U.S.     , 115 S.Ct.\r                                               \r\n\n940, 130 L.Ed.2d 885 (1995), we affirm.\r\n\n          The  facts,  as far  as  they  were established  at\r\n\ntrial,  may  be briefly  stated.    Harvard Square  Cleaners,\r\n\nHarvard Square, Cambridge (hereinafter the store), is a small\r\n\nestablishment  that  receives   clothes  from  customers  for\r\n\ncleaning,  sends them  out to  clean, and  ultimately returns\r\n\nthem  to customers upon receiving  payment.  On  May 9, 1989,\r\n\nthe sole  employee was  Carmel Mhodhrain, who  worked, alone,\r\n\nfrom  7:00 a.m.  to 7:00  p.m.   She testified  she  had been\r\n\nworking  there for some  seven months.  At  about 4:00 p.m. a\r\n\nman she  had never  seen before  entered the  otherwise empty\r\n\nstore.   She  could say no  more than  that he  was black, of\r\n\nmedium height, slender, with black  hair and was wearing blue\r\n\njeans  and a black sweater.  After inquiring about having his\r\n\nleather  jacket, which he had  with him, cleaned,  he said he\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nhad to use a bathroom and left.  He later returned, and after\r\n\na  further discussion  Mhodhrain  leaned on  the counter  and\r\n\nbegan writing a  customer slip when she  felt something prick\r\n\nher  neck.  She jumped back and  saw the man holding a knife.\r\n\nHe then  came inside the  counter, pushed various  buttons on\r\n\nthe cash register and  when it opened took some $400  in cash\r\n\nand put it in his pocket.  Mhodhrain backed away, and, on his\r\n\norders, went into the bathroom  that was behind the  counter.\r\n\nThe man  closed the door and she heard a  noise as if he were\r\n\ntrying to tie  or lock the  door shut.   After three or  four\r\n\nminutes  she heard the front door close and came out, finding\r\n\na vacuum cleaner cord tied around the doorknob.   She went to\r\n\nthe telephone  but found  the cord  cut.  She  then \"went  to\r\n\nsecurity, the security  office, and the security  man came in\r\n\nand he was going to call the  police and then he went back to\r\n\nthe office to call the police from his office.\"\r\n\n          Some time after Mhodhrain returned a police officer\r\n\ncame and lifted fingerprints.  At trial, a police fingerprint\r\n\nexpert  testified  that he  compared a  print taken  from the\r\n\nbathroom's outer  doorknob, finding 20 points  of comparison,\r\n\nand no  dissimilarities, with  defendant's print  on record.1\r\n\nNo  opinion was offered as to how  long the print had been on\r\n\nthe knob.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.    According to  FBI standards 12 points of  comparison is\r\nsufficient for a positive identification.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          At trial Mhodhrain testified that \"the only persons\r\n\nwho  had access to th[e]  area [behind the  counter] would be\r\n\nthe persons  working in the  store or  the driver who  has to\r\n\nbring the clothes in.\"   There was no testimony,  however, as\r\n\nto  whether excluding  customers was  her personal  policy or\r\n\nstore policy, or  who had  worked the  day before.   She  was\r\n\nunable  to identify defendant in the courtroom.  At the close\r\n\nof  the Commonwealth's case  defendant moved, unsuccessfully,\r\n\nfor a finding of not  guilty on the ground that the  evidence\r\n\nwas  insufficient to sustain a finding that he was the person\r\n\nwho  committed  the robbery.    He  has  advanced this  claim\r\n\nthroughout direct and habeas appeals.\r\n\n          Where,  as  here,  there  is  no  evidence  linking\r\n\ndefendant  to the  crime other  than his  fingerprint at  the\r\n\nscene, our question  is whether  it could be  found beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt that defendant left his print at the time of\r\n\nthe  robbery.   The  evidence must  foreclose all  reasonably\r\n\nviable possibilities that he could have left it at some other\r\n\ntime.   Mikes v. Borg, 947 F.2d  353, 356-57 (9th Cir. 1991),\r                                 \r\n\ncert. denied,     U.S.     , 112 S.Ct. 3055, 120  L.Ed.2d 921\r                        \r\n\n(1992)  (citing  cases of  several  circuits).   Indeed,  the\r\n\nAppeals  Court here said as  much.  Commonwealth  v. Hall, 32\r                                                                     \r\n\nMass. App. Ct. 951, 952, 590 N.E.2d 1177 (1992).\r\n\n          Reviewing  the  evidence   most  favorably  to  the\r\n\nprosecution,  as we must, Jackson  v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n319  (1979),  we  see  no  problem  with  the  trial  court's\r\n\nconcluding  beyond a reasonable  doubt that defendant's print\r\n\nwas  not  made  after the  robbery.    Even  on the  unlikely\r                                 \r\n\nassumption that  Mhodhrain left the store  unlocked while she\r\n\nwent for  the security officer, the  court could sufficiently\r\n\nfind that defendant did  not slip in and handle  the bathroom\r\n\ndoorknob during her absence.  Whether defendant's print might\r\n\nhave been placed on  the knob sometime before the  robbery is\r\n\nmore difficult.\r\n\n          The Massachusetts Appeals  Court, in affirming  the\r\n\nconviction, reasoned  that  \"because the  fingerprint  lifted\r\n\nfrom the doorknob was unsmudged2,  and since the bathroom was\r\n\nused regularly by  all the store's  employees, the print  was\r\n\nlikely  put there  by one  of the  last people  to touch  the\r\n\nknob.\"  Hall, 32 Mass. App. Ct. at 952, 590 N.E. at 1178.  We\r                        \r\n\ncan  agree, but to what  extent does this  indicate the time?\r\n\nWas  some, more generous,  employee on  duty the  day before?\r\n\nWere there  no other prints, demonstrating  survivorship?  No\r\n\naffirmative  attempt was  made to  eliminate  the possibility\r\n\nthat  defendant's print had  not been made  the previous day.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Strictly, the exhibit showing the print was not made part\r\nof  the  record,  and  the  witness  who  testified  to   its\r\ncharacteristics  did  not  speak  as to  non-smudging.    His\r\ntestimony as  to details,  however, clearly warranted  such a\r\nfinding.   Since defendant's  constitutional claim requires a\r\nshowing  that the  evidence did  not warrant  the conviction,\r\nthis factual issue must be resolved against defendant.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nAt the same time, a doorknob is a very small  area, and it is\r\n\nused  with  pressure.   Defendant's  print,  an exhibit,  was\r\n\nunsmudged.   Mhodhrain had been  on duty nine  hours that day\r\n\nand manifestly would have used the bathroom -- and,  perhaps,\r\n\nhandling  soiled clothes,  for an  occasional wash-up.   Four\r\n\njudges,  before ourselves,  have thought  the inference  most\r\n\ncompelling that defendant's print was made at the time of the\r\n\nrobbery.\r\n\n          In  this circumstance should  we count  against the\r\n\nCommonwealth  a doubt  based on  the prosecutor's  failure to\r\n\nhave  asked the obvious questions that would have cinched its\r\n\ncase?   Does this lapse  indicate the answers  would not have\r\n\ncinched  the case, but the  contrary?  Admittedly,  this is a\r\n\nlong  shot.  If  the trial had  been in the  federal court we\r\n\nmight have added to that remote possibility the breath of our\r\n\ngeneral  authority,   not   simply  to   rebut   the   remote\r\n\npossibility, but, in part, to prevent government counsel from\r\n\nleaving even the appearance  of avoiding evidence contrary to\r\n\nits position.  We  do not have such authority over our sister\r\n\ncourts.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n",

Harvard Square  Cleaners,\r\n\nHarvard Square, Cambridge (hereinafter the store), is a small\r\n\nestablishment  that  receives   clothes  from  customers  for\r\n\ncleaning,  sends them  out to  clean, and  ultimately returns\r\n\nthem  to customers upon receiving  payment.  On  May 9, 1989,\r\n\nthe sole  employee was  Carmel Mhodhrain, who  worked, alone,\r\n\nfrom  7:00 a.m.  to 7:00  p.m.   She testified  she  had been\r\n\nworking  there for some  seven months.  At  about 4:00 p.m. a\r\n\nman she  had never  seen before  entered the  otherwise empty\r\n\nstore.   She  could say no  more than  that he  was black, of\r\n\nmedium height, slender, with black  hair and was wearing blue\r\n\njeans  and a black sweater.  After inquiring about having his\r\n\nleather  jacket, which he had  with him, cleaned,  he said he\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nhad to use a bathroom and left.  He later returned, and after\r\n\na  further discussion  Mhodhrain  leaned on  the counter  and\r\n\nbegan writing a  customer slip when she  felt something prick\r\n\nher  neck.  She jumped back and  saw the man holding a knife.\r\n\nHe then  came inside the  counter, pushed various  buttons on\r\n\nthe cash register and  when it opened took some $400  in cash\r\n\nand put it in his pocket.  Mhodhrain backed away, and, on his\r\n\norders, went into the bathroom  that was behind the  counter.\r\n\nThe man  closed the door and she heard a  noise as if he were\r\n\ntrying to tie  or lock the  door shut.   After three or  four\r\n\nminutes  she heard the front door close and came out, finding\r\n\na vacuum cleaner cord tied around the doorknob.   She went to\r\n\nthe telephone  but found  the cord  cut.  She  then \"went  to\r\n\nsecurity, the security  office, and the security  man came in\r\n\nand he was going to call the  police and then he went back to\r\n\nthe office to call the police from his office.\"\r\n\n          Some time after Mhodhrain returned a police officer\r\n\ncame and lifted fingerprints.  At trial, a police fingerprint\r\n\nexpert  testified  that he  compared a  print taken  from the\r\n\nbathroom's outer  doorknob, finding 20 points  of comparison,\r\n\nand no  dissimilarities, with  defendant's print  on record.1\r\n\nNo  opinion was offered as to how  long the print had been on\r\n\nthe knob.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.    According to  FBI standards 12 points of  comparison is\r\nsufficient for a positive identification.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          At trial Mhodhrain testified that \"the only persons\r\n\nwho  had access to th[e]  area [behind the  counter] would be\r\n\nthe persons  working in the  store or  the driver who  has to\r\n\nbring the clothes in.\"   There was no testimony,  however, as\r\n\nto  whether excluding  customers was  her personal  policy or\r\n\nstore policy, or  who had  worked the  day before.   She  was\r\n\nunable  to identify defendant in the courtroom.  At the close\r\n\nof  the Commonwealth's case  defendant moved, unsuccessfully,\r\n\nfor a finding of not  guilty on the ground that the  evidence\r\n\nwas  insufficient to sustain a finding that he was the person\r\n\nwho  committed  the robbery.    He  has  advanced this  claim\r\n\nthroughout direct and habeas appeals.\r\n\n          Where,  as  here,  there  is  no  evidence  linking\r\n\ndefendant  to the  crime other  than his  fingerprint at  the\r\n\nscene, our question  is whether  it could be  found beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt that defendant left his print at the time of\r\n\nthe  robbery.   The  evidence must  foreclose all  reasonably\r\n\nviable possibilities that he could have left it at some other\r\n\ntime.   Mikes v.

Even  on the  unlikely\r                                 \r\n\nassumption that  Mhodhrain left the store  unlocked while she\r\n\nwent for  the security officer, the  court could sufficiently\r\n\nfind that defendant did  not slip in and handle  the bathroom\r\n\ndoorknob during her absence.  Whether defendant's print might\r\n\nhave been placed on  the knob sometime before the  robbery is\r\n\nmore difficult.\r\n\n          The Massachusetts Appeals  Court, in affirming  the\r\n\nconviction, reasoned  that  \"because the  fingerprint  lifted\r\n\nfrom the doorknob was unsmudged2,  and since the bathroom was\r\n\nused regularly by  all the store's  employees, the print  was\r\n\nlikely  put there  by one  of the  last people  to touch  the\r\n\nknob.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Hall,</span> <span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass. App. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">952</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 590 N.E. at 1178.  We\r                        \r\n\ncan  agree, but to what  extent does this  indicate the time?\r\n\nWas  some, more generous,  employee on  duty the  day before?\r\n\nWere there  no other prints, demonstrating  survivorship?  No\r\n\naffirmative  attempt was  made to  eliminate  the possibility\r\n\nthat  defendant's print had  not been made  the previous day.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Strictly, the exhibit showing the print was not made part\r\nof  the  record,  and  the  witness  who  testified  to   its\r\ncharacteristics  did  not  speak  as to  non-smudging.    His\r\ntestimony as  to details,  however, clearly warranted  such a\r\nfinding.   Since defendant's  constitutional claim requires a\r\nshowing  that the  evidence did  not warrant  the conviction,\r\nthis factual issue must be resolved against defendant.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nAt the same time, a doorknob is a very small  area, and it is\r\n\nused  with  pressure.   Defendant's  print,  an exhibit,  was\r\n\nunsmudged.   Mhodhrain had been  on duty nine  hours that day\r\n\nand manifestly would have used the bathroom -- and,  perhaps,\r\n\nhandling  soiled clothes,  for an  occasional wash-up.   Four\r\n\njudges,  before ourselves,  have thought  the inference  most\r\n\ncompelling that defendant's print was made at the time of the\r\n\nrobbery.\r\n\n          In  this circumstance should  we count  against the\r\n\nCommonwealth  a doubt  based on  the prosecutor's  failure to\r\n\nhave  asked the obvious questions that would have cinched its\r\n\ncase?   Does this lapse  indicate the answers  would not have\r\n\ncinched  the case, but the  contrary?  Admittedly,  this is a\r\n\nlong  shot.  If  the trial had  been in the  federal court we\r\n\nmight have added to that remote possibility the breath of our\r\n\ngeneral  authority,   not   simply  to   rebut   the   remote\r\n\npossibility, but, in part, to prevent government counsel from\r\n\nleaving even the appearance  of avoiding evidence contrary to\r\n\nits position.  We  do not have such authority over our sister\r\n\ncourts.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n</pre>",
