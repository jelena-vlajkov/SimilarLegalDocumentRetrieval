After exhausting\n\nhis remedies in the  state courts, Matthews sought a  writ of\n\nhabeas corpus in the  district court pursuant to 28  U.S.C.  \n\n2254,  claiming that he was  denied his Sixth Amendment right\n\nto  effective assistance  of  counsel.   After referring  the\n\nmatter to a magistrate-judge for a report and recommendation,\n\nthe  district court  granted  the petition,  and this  appeal\n\nfollowed.  For the reasons discussed below, we reverse.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n                          BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \n\nA.  Pretrial Events\r                               \n\n          On May  15, 1986, Brenda Barbosa,  who was fourteen\n\nyears old at the time, reported to Boston police that she had\n\nbeen attacked in  her bedroom by a  man with a knife  earlier\n\nthat  morning.   Later that  same day, after  viewing several\n\nhundred photographs in  police identification books,  Barbosa\n\nidentified  Matthews, who  wears  his hair  in a  distinctive\n\n\"dreadlocks\" style and was so  depicted in the photograph, as\n\nthe man who had attacked her.   The police obtained an arrest\n\nwarrant but,  although they knew Matthews's  address, made no\n\nimmediate attempt to question him about the incident  or take\n\nhim into custody.   Matthews was  eventually arrested on  May\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n28,  1986,  when  a patrolling  officer  who  had stopped  to\n\nquestion  Matthews  on  the  street  about unrelated  conduct\n\ndiscovered the outstanding warrant.\n\n          The  incident  report filed  by  the Boston  police\n\nofficer who first responded  to Barbosa's call (the \"incident\n\nreport\") contains  no  mention  of  a sexual  assault.    The\n\nofficer's account  of his  interview with  Barbosa, conducted\n\nwithin two hours of the incident, is as follows:\n\n          [T]he victim  . . . stated  while she was\n          sleeping the suspect entered the victim's\n          bedroom and  jumped on  top of her.   The\n          victim stated  the suspect had  a kitchen\n          knife  and told  her, \"Be quiet,  I don't\n          want  nothing from  you,  you  won't  get\n          hurt.\"   The  victim  further stated  the\n          suspect  then pulled the  victim from her\n          bed and ordered the  victim to stand in a\n          corner  then  the  suspect   ordered  the\n          victim  to stand  against  a  wall.   The\n          victim  then  stated the  suspect started\n          looking  through the  rooms on  all three\n          floors.   The  victim further  stated the\n          suspect then told the victim to close the\n          door behind  him when he left  and not to\n          tell anyone about him.  The victim stated\n          she complied and the suspect fled on foot\n          to a  yellow m/v then fled  in an unknown\n          direction.\n\nThe  incident report  includes a  description of  the alleged\n\nassailant  as a black male, 5'10\", black hair and brown eyes,\n\nwearing  a black hat,  brown leather jacket  and black pants.\n\nIt does not indicate whether Barbosa mentioned to the officer\n\nthat her attacker had dreadlocks.\n\n          Matthews  was initially charged  with armed assault\n\nin  a dwelling  with  intent to  commit  a felony,  and  with\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nbreaking  and  entering.     A  probable  cause  hearing  was\n\nconducted in Roxbury District Court on August 4, 1986.  There\n\nis no transcript of the hearing  in the record.  Although the\n\nbreaking  and  entering  charge  was  dropped  following  the\n\nhearing, Matthews was bound over on the armed assault charge.\n\nSubsequently, grand  jury proceedings were initiated  on that\n\ncharge  as  well as  two  new  charges  apparently  based  on\n\nBarbosa's testimony at the probable cause hearing:  rape of a\n\nchild  with force,  and  indecent assault  and  battery on  a\n\nperson under 14.  At the grand jury proceeding, Boston Police\n\nDetective  William  Ingersoll   --  who  oversaw   the  photo\n\nidentification procedure in which Barbosa picked out Matthews\n\n-- testified as follows:\n\n          A.  .  . . At the  probable cause hearing\n          in the Roxbury Court  I was not present .\n          . . and  I received  a message  following\n          that hearing from  the District  Attorney\n          who stated to me that during the probable\n          cause  hearing  the  victim  --  who  was\n          afraid to tell her mother and the  police\n          -- that at the  time during this breaking\n          and entering and  assault, the  defendant\n          did  assault this  young girl,  again, 14\n          years of age.\n\n          Q.  In what manner?\n\n          A.  I believe  it was placing the fingers\n          to  her  vagina, more  or  less just  the\n          fingers.  She did  not go to the hospital\n          to be  examined.   Again, she is  a young\n          Spanish girl and was ashamed even to tell\n          the mother.\n               There was no complaints at that time\n          for  rape in  the Roxbury  District Court\n          against him. I was unaware of this fact. \n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Barbosa  also  testified  before  the  grand  jury.\n\nCertain aspects  of her account of the May 15 events were not\n\nentirely consistent with the second-hand version contained in\n\nthe incident report:\n\n          A.  Well, I was  sleeping and I heard the\n          bedroom door, and when I looked up I seen\n          this  man and he jumped on  top of me and\n          put me against the wall . . . .\n\n          . . . .\n\n          Q.  Did he take anything?\n\n          A.  The only thing I found missing was my\n          leather coat, and stuff was in the  first\n          floor.\n\n          Q.   Do  you  know whether  he took  that\n          coat?\n\n          A.  I don't really know, but he must have\n          took  it because  I  couldn't find  it; I\n          looked for  it; I asked my  sister if she\n          let someone use it; she said, no.\n\n          . . . .\n\n          Q.  Now, when this man jumped on you, did\n          he touch you in any way?\n\n          A.  Yes.\n\n          Q.  And  what part  of your  body did  he\n          touch?\n\n          A.  He touched me, all parts.\n\n          Q.  You[r] chest and your vaginal area?\n\n          A.  Yes, sir.\n\n          Q.   Did  he  put his  fingers into  your\n          vagina at some time?\n\n          A.  Yes.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Q.   When the  police came that  day, did\n          you tell the police that day?\n\n          A.       I  told  them   everything  that\n          happened, like in  a way I was  -- when I\n          went to the police station to look at the\n          pictures I told them what happened.\n\nB.  The Trial\r                         \n\n          On August  17, 1987, Matthews was  brought to trial\n\non the rape, armed assault and indecent assault charges.  The\n\nprosecution called two witnesses, Barbosa and Ingersoll, with\n\nMatthews  as  the  only defense  witness.    Because  we must\n\nevaluate the alleged constitutional deficiencies of counsel's\n\nperformance in light  of his \"overall  performance throughout\n\nthe  case,\"  Strickland  v.  Washington, 466  U.S.  668,  689\r                                                   \n\n(1984), we provide an extensive summary of the trial record.\n\n          1.  Opening Statements\r                                            \n\n          In his opening  statement, the prosecutor told  the\n\njury  that  immediately  after  Barbosa's  attacker left  her\n\napartment, Barbosa ran next  door \"and told her sister-in-law\n\nwhat  had happened.\"   Despite  strong evidence  that Barbosa\n\nnever told anyone  that she  had been  sexually assaulted  or\n\nraped  until  she  testified  at  Matthews's  probable  cause\n\nhearing,  81  days  after   the  incident,  Matthews's  trial\n\ncounsel, Kenneth D'Arcy,  did not challenge the  prosecutor's\n\nassertions.  D'Arcy  made clear from the  outset that instead\n\nof challenging  Barbosa's allegations,  he would try  to show\n\nthat she  had mistakenly  picked Matthews  out of the  police\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nphotograph  books because  of  his  distinctive  \"dreadlocks\"\n\nhairstyle.   D'Arcy told the jury that \"[t]here's no question\n\nin my mind  and Mr.  Matthews' mind that  Brenda Barbosa  was\n\nattacked in her  bedroom on May  15th.  But  you're going  to\n\nhear from Mr. Matthews that on May 15th he was working in his\n\nfather's garage.\"\n\n          2.  Barbosa's Testimony\r                                             \n\n          Barbosa, who  had reached  sixteen years of  age by\n\nthe time of the  trial, testified on direct examination  that\n\nshe was  asleep in her bed  about 8:30 a.m. on  May 15, 1986,\n\nwhen she was awakened by  a man entering her room.   When she\n\nlooked up,  she saw the man had a knife.   The man got on top\n\nof her, put the knife to her throat and told her to be  quiet\n\nor he would kill her.   The man touched Barbosa's breasts and\n\nput his finger inside Barbosa's vagina.  Then, the man pulled\n\nBarbosa  off the bed and  placed her against  a wall, telling\n\nher to stay there while he walked  through other rooms of the\n\nhouse.  Barbosa said  he took her leather coat,  although she\n\ndid not say whether she saw him carry the coat away.  Barbosa\n\nidentified Matthews  as  the  man  who  attacked  her.    The\n\nfollowing exchange then ensued:\n\n          Q.  You went to your sister-in-law's; did\n          you tell her what happened?\n\n          A.  Yes.\n\n          Q.  Did you call the police?\n\n          A.  Yes, I did.\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Q.    You reported  this  to  the police,\n          didn't you?\n\n          A.  Yes.\n\n          Q.  Now, at some point during the day did\n          you  have an  opportunity  to  meet  with\n          Detective Ingersoll of the Boston Police?\n\n          A.  Yes, I did.\n\n          Q.   Did you  go over what  happened with\n          him?  Did you tell him about that?\n\n          A.  Yes, I did.\n\n          Barbosa  then  testified  as  to  how   she  picked\n\nMatthews's photograph out of the police books.  She said that\n\nshe got a good look at her attacker's face; that her attacker\n\nhad long hair pinned up under a gray beret-like hat; and that\n\nshe had described the man to police as being about five-foot-\n\neleven with  dreadlocks and  a hat.   Barbosa  also testified\n\nthat a  few days after the  attack, the same man  came to her\n\ndoor and rang the doorbell.   She said that she \"went  crazy,\n\nand . . . started crying, and he just left.\"\n\n          In his cross-examination,  D'Arcy quickly began his\n\nattempt to show that Barbosa had immediately zeroed in on the\n\nfact that the assailant had dreadlocks:\n\n          Q.   This  man  came in,  and what's  the\n          first  thing  you   remember  about   his\n          physical appearance when  you saw him  in\n          your bedroom?\n\n          A.   I don't  really understand  what you\n          mean.\n\n          Q.      What  was   the   first  physical\n          characteristic that  you saw in  this man\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          when you  saw him  in the bedroom  and he\n          woke you up and  you were afraid;  what's\n          the first thing you recognized about him?\n\n          A.  The knife.\n\n          Q.    And  then  what  about  a  physical\n          characteristic?  After you saw the knife,\n          and you saw this man with the knife, what\n          physical characteristic did you remember?\n\n          A.   I  still  don't understand  what you\n          mean.\n\n          Q.  When you describe people --\n\n          A.  Yes.\n\n          Q.  -- you describe people as short --\n\n          A.  Oh, you want me to describe him, like\n          when he first came in?\n\n          Q.  Yes, when you first saw  this man and\n          you saw  the knife, and you  got over the\n          shock of the knife, and you saw that this\n          man  was in  your bedroom  and he  didn't\n          belong there --\n\n          A.  Yes.\n\n          Q.   --  what physical  characteristic of\n          this man did you first remember --  first\n          remember?\n\n          A.  The way he  looked, his face, and the\n          way he was like coming towards me.\n\n          Q.  What about his hair style?\n\n          A.  I recognized that too.\n\n          Q.  The dreadlocks?\n\n          A.  Yes.\n\n          D'Arcy   then   questioned   Barbosa    about   her\n\nidentification of Matthews  as her attacker.  He elicited the\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nnot-too-helpful testimony that she had seen other people with\n\ndreadlocks  before encountering Matthews,  but that  they did\n\nnot  look like him; that she identified Matthews the same day\n\nas  the  alleged attack;  that  she \"could  never  forget his\n\nface\";  and that she had picked the picture out after viewing\n\nit for just half a second.   Before he concluded this line of\n\nquestioning,  D'Arcy  inartfully  allowed  Barbosa  one  more\n\nopportunity  to  tell the  jury how  certain  she was  of her\n\nidentification of Matthews:\n\n          Q.  There's no question in your mind that\n          this  is the  man  that  broke into  your\n          house and had a knife in his hand?\n\n          A.  That's the man.\n\nAt that point,  D'Arcy changed the  focus of his  examination\n\nand began to question Barbosa's  account of what had happened\n\nand her veracity:\n\n          Q.  Then did you tell Detective Ingersoll\n          at that  time, you know, that  he touched\n          your private parts at all?\n\n          A.  I told him what had happened.\n\n          Q.  Well, did you tell  him, you know, as\n          you told  the  jury today,  that the  man\n          grabbed your private parts?\n\n          A.   I only told  him what he  was asking\n          me.\n\n          Q.  Is it  fair to say, Brenda, that  you\n          really  didn't  tell Detective  Ingersoll\n          everything  that  happened when  you were\n          going over the pictures?\n\n          A.   I  told  him  most  everything  that\n          happened.\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Q.   But  you didn't  tell him  about the\n          fact that  this man touched  your private\n          parts?\n\n          A.   No, but I  told the other  cops when\n          they came.\n\n          Q.  When?\n\n          A.  When it first happened, the cops that\n          came over  to the  house.  It's  right in\n          the report.\n\n          Q.   You  told them  that he  had grabbed\n          you?\n\n          A.  Yes.\n\n          Q.    And  touched  your  private  parts,\n          right?\n\n          A.  Yes.\n\nAlthough these  last  four answers  were  apparently  untrue,\n\nD'Arcy  did  not directly  confront  Barbosa  with any  prior\n\nstatements or other evidence contradicting her testimony.\n\n          3.  Ingersoll's Testimony\r                                               \n\n          Ingersoll testified that Barbosa and her sister-in-\n\nlaw, Carmen Barbosa, came  to his office on the  afternoon of\n\nMay  15 to  view photographs.   Ingersoll  said he  \"tried to\n\ndetermine what  exactly had happened\" and  then began showing\n\nBarbosa books  containing   photographs of  black men of  the\n\napproximate   age  that  Barbosa   had  described.  Ingersoll\n\ntestified that, in his estimation, Barbosa viewed \"about 600,\n\n700  photographs.\"   When  she  turned to  the  photograph of\n\nMatthews,  Ingersoll  said,  Barbosa  \"became  very  excited.\n\n`That's  him.'  She  got up  from the  table, jumping  up and\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ndown.   `That's him, that's  him.'\"  Ingersoll  said that the\n\npicture of Matthews matched the general description contained\n\nin  the  original  incident   report,  and  that  during  her\n\nconversation with Ingersoll prior to viewing the photographs,\n\nBarbosa had mentioned that the attacker had dreadlocks.\n\n          On cross-examination, D'Arcy  resumed his  strategy\n\nof  trying to  show that  Barbosa had  picked  out Matthews's\n\npicture because of his dreadlocks:\n\n          Q.  Now, when  Brenda Barbosa came in the\n          station,  she gave  you a  description of\n          the man that was in her home earlier, had\n          dreadlocks; do you remember?\n\n          A.  That's correct.\n\n          Q.   You  don't  have any  books or  just\n          males with dreadlocks, though; right?\n\n          A.   No,  sir.   The  space just  doesn't\n          allow it.\n\n          . . . .\n\n          Q.   Did you  look at  any of  the photos\n          that she looked at, looking for men  with\n          dreadlocks?\n\n          A.  Not at that particular time, no, sir.\n          I basically  put a lot of the photographs\n          in the  books  when we  receive them  for\n          identification.   I don't  make a special\n          notice of dreadlocks.\n\n          Q.    Do  you   know  how  many  men  had\n          dreadlocks  in  the  photos  before  Miss\n          Barbosa picked Lloyd Matthews' picture?\n\n          A.  I have no idea.\n\n          Q.  It could have been any of them?\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          A.   It could  have been any,  could have\n          been a few, could have been one.  I don't\n          know.\n\n          Q.  Could have been one, right?\n\n          A.   The  books are  set up,  Mr. D'Arcy,\n          only by age, sex and race; that's it.\n\n          Q.   So you're  testifying today that Mr.\n          Matthews could  have been the  first male\n          that had dreadlocks in those photo books;\n          correct, Detective?\n\n          A.  Could have been.\n\nUpon further questioning by D'Arcy, Ingersoll  testified that\n\nhe  \"kn[e]w for a fact that there are many dreadlocks\" in the\n\nphotograph  books, and that  he had \"had  every confidence in\n\nthe  world  that she  would run  into  dreadlocks.\"   He also\n\ntestified that he did not personally arrest Matthews, nor did\n\nhe immediately have police officers  go to Matthews's home to\n\narrest him once an arrest warrant issued.  Instead, Ingersoll\n\nsaid, he told  another police officer with duty in Matthews's\n\nneighborhood of the warrant,  and that officer told Ingersoll\n\n\"that he would  lock him up when he sees  him.\"  Matthews was\n\nultimately arrested when police stopped to  question him on a\n\nRoxbury street on  May 28,  nine days after  the warrant  had\n\nissued  and thirteen  days  after the  crimes allegedly  took\n\nplace.\n\n          4.  The Defense\r                                     \n\n          After the  prosecution rested, D'Arcy  notified the\n\ncourt  that Matthews  was \"very  upset\" with  D'Arcy  for not\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nwanting  to recall Barbosa to the stand to question her about\n\ndiscrepancies  between   her   trial  testimony   and   prior\n\nstatements.  D'Arcy told the court:\n\n          But in  my  perusal  of  the  grand  jury\n          minutes, I  mean -- you know,  this is an\n          identity  type of  case, your  Honor.   I\n          know  what the  girl  has  been  through.\n          It's obvious that  a crime was committed.\n          My  client's  defense  is  that   it's  a\n          misidentity.   She testified there was no\n          question in her mind it was him.\n               Whether she came downstairs with him\n          or looked out the window, there's sort of\n          minor   discrepancies   as  far   as  I'm\n          concerned.\n               It's  a disadvantage when you try to\n          examine young ladies  because of the fact\n          that she's highly emotional.  I just feel\n          -- I disagree with my client.  I told him\n          I didn't  want to recall  Brenda Barbosa.\n          You know,  the  bottom line  is that  I'm\n          trying the case and he isn't.\n               But  I  just   want  the  record  to\n          reflect  that, you  know, he's  been more\n          than  vociferous  that  he doesn't  agree\n          with my strategy, shall we say.\n\n          D'Arcy then called Matthews to the stand.  Matthews\n\ntestified that he had worked  at his \"father\" John  Wornum's1\n\nauto body shop  in Roxbury on and off for  years.  From April\n\nuntil  July  of 1986,  Matthews testified,  he and  a friend,\n\nChris  Cross,   were  rebuilding  a  junked   car  that  they\n\neventually  sold to a friend  of Wornum.   Matthews could not\n\nsay  specifically  that he  was working  at  the shop  on the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Wornum explained in a  post-trial affidavit that he  is a\nlong-time friend of Matthews's family and that Matthews would\nsometimes  call him his  \"uncle\" or \"father\"  even though the\ntwo are not related.\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nmorning of  May 15, 1986, but  he said that it  was his usual\n\npractice to open up the shop each morning at 7:30 a.m.  \n\n          On  cross-examination,  Matthews explained  that he\n\nwas paid in cash and had no records or pay stubs proving that\n\nhe worked at the body shop.  John Wornum, Matthews testified,\n\nhad  been in Georgia for several  months; Wornum's son, Rufus\n\nWornum, was busy running the shop, and Chris Cross had agreed\n\nto  testify on his behalf  but had since  joined the Marines.\n\nMatthews also  testified that he had no records pertaining to\n\nthe  rebuilt car,  and that  he did not  know the  person who\n\nbought it  other than that  he was  a friend of  John Wornum.\n\nThe prosecutor's final exchange with Matthews was as follows:\n\n          Q.  You're not specifically testifying as\n          to where  you were on the  morning of May\n          15th, 1986; are you?\n\n          A.  No, sir.\n\n          5.  Closing Arguments\r                                           \n\n          Unlike his opening, D'Arcy's summation contained at\n\nleast  some hints to the jury that perhaps Barbosa's story of\n\nwhat  happened  to  her was  not  entirely  truthful.   After\n\nincorrectly telling  the  jury that  they  had \"seen  a  girl\n\nfourteen years old,\" D'Arcy urged the jurors not to let their\n\nemotions affect their deliberations about\n\n          what happened to this girl, if in fact it\n          did happen. . . .\n               . . . .\n               You  have  to   decide  did   Brenda\n          Barbosa   really   tell   the  truth   of\n          everything that  happened.  Did  she wake\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n          up and  see a fellow there  with a knife?\n          Was it somebody maybe  she -- she  didn't\n          go  to school  that day  -- that  maybe a\n          fellow that she was going to go to school\n          with  -- maybe  something got  carried on\n          that she didn't expect and  she panicked,\n          because  she  lived right  --  a relative\n          lived right around the corner.\n               Did it happen to  her?  Did she tell\n          Officer  Ingersoll  that  she   had  been\n          sexually assaulted?\n\nD'Arcy  did  not, however,  point  to any  evidence  or prior\n\nstatements   suggesting  that   Barbosa  was   not  truthful.\n\nInstead, he  discussed at  length how a  \"hysterical\" Barbosa\n\nhad  zeroed in on Matthews's photograph \"[a]s soon as she saw\n\nthe  dreadlocks,\" and how the failure of the police to arrest\n\nMatthews  as soon as Barbosa had identified him was not \"fair\n\nplay.\"   The  near-two-week delay  in Matthews's  arrest left\n\nMatthews virtually no chance to prove that he was at the body\n\nshop while Barbosa allegedly was attacked, D'Arcy argued.\n\n          Toward  the  end  of  his  argument,  D'Arcy  again\n\nsuggested that this was not just a case of mistaken identity,\n\nbut also of truthfulness:\n\n               Did you hear any  hospital testimony\n          regarding  any  physical disability  with\n          Brenda  Barbosa?   Because I  suggest she\n          didn't  tell anybody  the day  she picked\n          out Mr. Matthews' picture.\n               Did  you hear any evidence of a lock\n          being  broken  or of  any  damage  to her\n          house that allowed  this stranger to come\n          in?  No.\n\nAnd again:\n\n               Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest that\n          all of these gaps create  some doubt, and\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          that's  the magic word, \"doubt\", beyond a\n          reasonable doubt.   That's what  you have\n          to be convinced, that Lloyd  Matthews was\n          the individual that came into a room, and\n          if  in  fact  there  was  a  breaking and\n          entering, and indecently assaulted Brenda\n          Barbosa,  if in  fact she was,  and stuck\n          his finger in her vagina, if in fact that\n          was done.\n               Because  I  suggest a  fourteen year\n          old  that this  has  really happened  to,\n          when   she  went   running  out   to  her\n          relation, she would have said, \"I've been\n          violated,\"  and  she   would  have   been\n          brought   right   to  the   hospital  for\n          examination.\n               You  know,  fourteen  years old,  if\n          this  is what  happened.   Then from  the\n          hospital  the  police would  have  got up\n          there, and then maybe if she had told all\n          the  truth  right  away  they  would have\n          picked up or investigated  Lloyd Matthews\n          that day.\n\nHad that occurred, D'Arcy  argued, Matthews could have proved\n\nwhere he  was the morning  of May  15 and refuted  the notion\n\nthat he was the dreadlocked man who had attacked Barbosa.\r                   \n\n          The prosecutor recounted how certain Barbosa was of\n\nher identification  and the substantial  opportunity she  had\n\nhad to see  him when he  entered her room  and was on top  of\n\nher.   He told  the jury  to consider  \"the sincerity of  her\n\nemotions\" in testifying:\n\n               Keep  that picture  of  her in  your\n          mind.   Those  were not  crocodile  tears\n          that came  out of  her eyes.   Those were\n          genuine  tears  based   on  honesty   and\n          certainty.\n               Brenda Barbosa came to this court to\n          seek  justice,  and   you  can  give  her\n          justice.  She is the victim.\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nIn contrast to Barbosa's sincerity, the prosecutor pointed to\n\nthe  \"vague\" nature of Matthews's testimony:  \"That he worked\n\nat a vague garage,  working on a vague Lincoln,  making vague\n\nrepairs.  Nothing to back it up.\"  In the end, the prosecutor\n\nsaid, the issue  for the jury was  one of credibility:   \"You\n\nhave  to  make a  determination of  who  to believe;  who was\n\nhonest; who was sincere; who was certain; and who was vague.\"\n\n          The  jury  deliberated for  about four-and-one-half\n\nhours  before  returning  verdicts  of guilty  on  all  three\n\ncounts.   Matthews was  sentenced to concurrent  state prison\n\nterms of 12 to 20 years, 10 to 15 years, and 4 to 5 years.\n\nC.  Post-Conviction Proceedings\r                                           \n\n          Matthews  moved  for a  new  trial on  a  number of\n\ngrounds,  including  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel and\n\nnewly discovered  evidence -- namely, an  affidavit from John\n\nWornum  to the  effect that  he would  corroborate Matthews's\n\ntestimony  that in May 1986, he normally opened the body shop\n\nat 7:30 in the  morning, and that  on May 15, 1986,  Matthews\n\n\"would  have  been  working\" at  the  shop  when Barbosa  was\n\nallegedly  attacked.  The trial court denied the motion.  The\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court affirmed  the conviction, and the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court  denied Matthews's petition to  obtain\n\nfurther appellate review.\n\n          Having exhausted his state remedies, Matthews filed\n\nhis  petition  for habeas  corpus  in the  district  court on\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nAugust  30,  1990.   Matthews  argued  that D'Arcy  committed\n\nnumerous errors that deprived  him of effective assistance of\n\ncounsel:  1) failure to impeach Brenda Barbosa with her prior\n\ninconsistent  statements;  2) failure  to  make an  effective\n\nclosing argument;  3) failure  to have Matthews's  only alibi\n\nwitness, John  Wornum, appear and  testify at  trial; and  4)\n\nfailure  to prepare  adequately for  trial and  to  object to\n\nimproper leading questions  and to  the prosecutor's  closing\n\nargument.    The  respondent  argued  that  D'Arcy's  alleged\n\n\"errors\" were tactical or strategic choices made so as not to\n\nundermine  D'Arcy's  strategy  of  pursuing  the \"dreadlocks\"\n\ndefense.\n\n          An evidentiary hearing was  convened on January 15,\n\n1993, but neither party chose to present evidence beyond that\n\nalready contained in the record.  On March 17, 1993, a United\n\nStates   Magistrate  Judge  agreed   with  virtually  all  of\n\nMatthews's assertions  and, finding that  \"the culmination of\n\nerrors taken as  a whole  . . .  establishes trial  counsel's\n\nineffective assistance  in this  case,\" recommended that  the\n\nwrit be allowed.\n\n          The district court  adopted the  magistrate-judge's\n\nrecommended result but  not her reasoning.   The court  found\n\nthat D'Arcy had adopted a professionally responsible strategy\n\nby not  contesting that Barbosa  was sexually assaulted  by a\n\nblack  man with dreadlocks and  by seeking instead to suggest\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nthat,  in  her subsequent  hysteria, she  mistakenly selected\n\nMatthews's  photograph because his was the first picture of a\n\nman  with dreadlocks.   The  court held  that because  D'Arcy\n\nrelied on the mistaken-identity defense, however, his failure\n\nto investigate Matthews's only alibi witness, John Wornum, or\n\nto seek a continuance  in order to do so, was  not ascribable\n\nto   any   strategic   reason   and   therefore   constituted\n\nconstitutionally   deficient   assistance  of   counsel  that\n\nprejudiced Matthews.\n\n          The  respondent  appealed,  arguing  that  Wornum's\n\naffidavit  contained no  indication that his  testimony would\n\nprovide an alibi for Matthews.  Matthews filed two briefs pro\n\nse,  one as  appellee  urging  that  we affirm  the  district\n\ncourt's order, and another as  appellant asking that we grant\n\nthe petition  on the  grounds recommended by  the magistrate-\n\njudge but rejected by the district court.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\nA.

Scarpa, 38 F.3d\r                                                                \n\nat 9.\n\nB.  D'Arcy's Performance\r                                    \n\n          Matthews concedes  that  the central  issue in  the\n\ncase was the identity of the attacker.  What he challenges is\n\nD'Arcy's decision to use  the \"dreadlocks\" defense to attempt\n\nto persuade the jury that Barbosa had misidentified Matthews,\n\nrather than  focusing on the apparent  inconsistencies of her\n\nprior statements and  her failure to report  the alleged rape\n\nimmediately.    D'Arcy's decision  to  employ  the dreadlocks\n\nstrategy was not a professionally reasonable choice, Matthews\n\nclaims, because D'Arcy possessed no evidence that Barbosa had\n\npicked  Matthews's photograph  out because of  his hairstyle.\n\nD'Arcy  had no  knowledge of  how many  pictures of  men with\n\ndreadlocks Barbosa had seen  before identifying Matthews, and\n\nthe  police report  contains no  indication that  Barbosa had\n\nmentioned  dreadlocks  in  her  initial  description  of  the\n\nattacker,  thus undermining the  argument that  the hairstyle\n\n                    \r                                \n\nmore-likely-than-not  outcome-determinative  standard.    466\nU.S. at 693.\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nwas  the  predominant feature.   Therefore,  Matthews argues,\n\ninstead of concealing  the fact that Barbosa did  not mention\n\ndreadlocks initially,  D'Arcy should have  driven this  point\n\nhome to the jury and called into question Barbosa's powers of\n\nobservation.  Furthermore, Matthews maintains,  D'Arcy should\n\nhave  questioned Barbosa  about the  discrepancy between  the\n\npolice  report's  version  of  when  she  initially  saw  her\n\nattacker, and  her  own testimony  -- i.e.,  whether she  was\n\nawakened by a man entering her bedroom and  jumping on top of\n\nher, or  whether she heard  the door, and  thus had a  longer\n\ntime to view  her attacker -- and he should  have called into\n\nquestion Barbosa's  truthfulness generally by  impeaching her\n\nregarding her delay in reporting the alleged rape.   Finally,\n\nMatthews argues,  D'Arcy should have marshalled  an effective\n\nclosing   argument   underscoring   the  inconsistencies   in\n\nBarbosa's   prior  statements,   rather  than   delivering  a\n\ndisjointed  speech  that,  Matthews  claims,  bordered  on an\n\ninvitation to convict.\n\n          We  disagree  that  D'Arcy's  strategic  choice  to\n\nemploy   the   \"dreadlocks   defense\"    was   professionally\n\nunreasonable.  That it was  not ultimately a winning strategy\n\nis  of no moment in assessing its reasonableness at the time,\n\nsee United States  v. Natanel,  938 F.2d 302,  310 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \n\n1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1079 (1992).  D'Arcy had little\r                               \n\nto  work  with,  given  the  persuasive  power  of  Barbosa's\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nidentification  testimony  and   the  inherent  weakness   of\n\nMatthews's  alibi,  and  he  chose  what  he  thought  was  a\n\nreasonable line of argument that  carried with it little risk\n\nof alienating the jury.   A strategic choice that  would have\n\nincluded more  direct attacks  on Barbosa's credibility  and,\n\ninevitably,  her character, would have carried  with it a far\n\ngreater risk of  offending the jury.  Thus,  we hold that, in\n\nchoosing  to  emphasize Matthews's  dreadlocks as  the reason\n\nthat  Barbosa identified  him  as her  attacker, rather  than\n\nhighlighting  alleged  inconsistencies  in   Barbosa's  trial\n\ntestimony   and  her  prior  statements,  D'Arcy  employed  a\n\nprofessionally reasonable strategy and  did not, by virtue of\n\nthat choice  alone, deprive Matthews of  effective assistance\n\nof counsel.\n\n          Matthews also argues,  however, that D'Arcy did  in\n\nfact  challenge Barbosa's credibility  -- by  questioning her\n\nabout her apparent failure to report immediately that she was\n\nraped, and  by arguing  this point to  the jury  -- and  that\n\ntherefore D'Arcy's  failure to impeach Barbosa more directly,\n\nor  at least  to  introduce the  impeaching evidence  through\n\nanother witness,  cannot be  deemed a  strategic choice.   We\n\nagree  that the record makes clear that D'Arcy did attempt to\n\nelicit from Barbosa an admission that she did not immediately\n\nreport the rape.   Indeed, D'Arcy successfully forced Barbosa\n\nto change her testimony and admit  that she had not, in fact,\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\ntold Detective Ingersoll  about the  rape.   The question  we\n\nmust  address, however, is  whether, once Barbosa  went on to\n\ntestify  that  she had  told  the  police who  had  initially\n\nresponded  to her  call that  she was  raped, and  that \"it's\n\nright in the report,\" D'Arcy's  failure to demonstrate to the\n\njury that these statements were apparently untrue constitutes\n\nineffective  assistance of  counsel.   Put  another way,  the\n\nissue  is  whether  it  may be  considered  acceptable  trial\n\nstrategy  to  have  questioned  Barbosa about  her  delay  in\n\nreporting the  rape without  impeaching her when  the answers\n\nshe gave were not favorable to Matthews.\n\n          Bearing in mind that the defendant must overcome \"a\n\nstrong presumption\"  that D'Arcy's conduct \"falls  within the\n\nwide   range   of   reasonable    professional   assistance,\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S.  at 689, we  are unable to  come to  any\r                      \n\nconclusion other than that Matthews has not done so here.  To\n\nbe  sure, there were  points to  be scored  against Barbosa's\n\ncredibility  after   she  insisted  that  she   had  in  fact\n\nimmediately  told  police that  she had  been raped.   D'Arcy\n\ncould have confronted her with the incident report containing\n\nno mention  of a rape, or  he could have asked  her about her\n\ntestimony  at the probable cause hearing.  He also could have\n\nquestioned Ingersoll about when he first learned that Barbosa\n\nclaimed to have been raped.  But, as D'Arcy made clear to the\n\ntrial judge at  a sidebar conference  following the close  of\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nthe prosecution's case,  Matthews's primary defense  remained\r                                                       \n\nthat Barbosa had picked out the wrong assailant, and not that\r                                                 \n\nshe had not  been attacked at all.  While  Barbosa's delay in\n\nreporting that  she was raped might have  affected the jury's\r                                               \n\nassessment of her overall credibility  as a witness, we think\n\nthis would be much more likely if  the primary issue had been\n\nconsent.    Here, the  primary issue,  and  the heart  of the\n\ndefense's theory, was not whether a crime occurred but rather\r                                             \n\nwho committed it.   Moreover, the record makes apparent  that\n\nBarbosa was quite obviously upset on the witness stand as she\n\nretold   her  experience;   this  circumstance,   along  with\n\nBarbosa's  youth  (rendering her  failure  to  report a  rape\n\nimmediately   all  the   more  explicable),   diminishes  the\n\nlikelihood  that the  jury would  doubt that  such an  attack\n\noccurred  simply  because Barbosa  delayed  in  reporting it.\n\nD'Arcy  had  to  balance  the limited  evidentiary  value  of\n\nBarbosa's delay against the  danger of the jury misperceiving\n\nan impeachment attempt  as badgering or  callously tarnishing\n\nBarbosa.    Another  lawyer  might have  struck  a  different\n\nbalance,  but  we  do  not  find  that  D'Arcy's  on-the-spot\n\ndecision  to  let  Barbosa's   answer  stand  and  argue  the\n\ninference  he had  raised to  the jury  was \"beyond  the wide\n\nrange of reasonable professional assistance.\"3\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Our dissenting  brother conveniently overlooks  that part\nof Barbosa's  identification testimony in  which she  claimed\nthat  Matthews made  a second  trip to  her home, only  to be\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\n          The  other  alleged  inconsistencies  in  Barbosa's\n\nstatements that Matthews claims D'Arcy should have raised are\n\ntrivial, and  thus D'Arcy's decision not  to question Barbosa\n\nabout  them was a sound  tactical choice.   That the incident\n\nreport, prepared  immediately after  the attack, contains  no\n\nmention  of dreadlocks,  is inconsequential  in light  of the\n\nfact  that   Barbosa  told   Ingersoll  before   viewing  any\n\nphotographs that her  attacker had dreadlocks.   Furthermore,\n\n                    \r                                \n\ndissuaded  from entering  by her  frightened response  to his\nappearance  at  her  door.     Given  the  strength   of  her\nidentification of him as her assailant, it was essential that\ncounsel try  to deflate  this aspect of  Barbosa's testimony.\nMoreover,  it  is  a  misstatement  to  say  that  there  was\n\"irrefutable evidence\" that Barbosa failed to report the rape\nfor an  eighty-one  day period.    While the  initial  police\nrecord does not indicate that a rape was part of the physical\nattack,  and Ingersoll's  grand jury  testimony was  that his\r                                                                         \nfirst knowledge of that part of  the attack came as a  result\nof the probable cause hearing, there is nothing in the record\nstating   unequivocally  that  Barbosa  had  not  told  other\nauthorities of the  alleged rape prior to the  probable cause\nhearing.\n          Finally, we respond to our brother's assertion that\nwe give  \"too  much credence  to  certain ageist  and  sexist\nassumptions -- that it would be improper to question  closely\n(and  risk arousing  the emotions  of) a young  female sexual\nassault  victim  . .  .  .\"   First,  our  assessment of  the\nreasonableness of D'Arcy's strategy would be no different had\nthe  victim been  a fourteen-year-old  boy.   Second, lawyers\nmust  devise their  strategies in  light  of how  real jurors\r                                                                  \nmight react -- not necessarily politically correct ones.  The\ndissent   suggests   that   a   lawyer   who   considers  the\nunfashionable assumptions and reactions of jurors in crafting\na  strategy deserves  less deference than  does a  lawyer who\nignores them or decides  that the jury will rise  above them.\nWe  disagree.  We do not dispute that D'Arcy could reasonably\r                                                              \nhave chosen a strategy involving more aggressive and complete\nimpeachment;  not doing so, in this case, was also within the\r                             \n\"wide range\" of reasonable professional choices recognized by\nthe Strickland Court.\r                          \n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nto point  out this  \"inconsistency\" would have  only weakened\n\nD'Arcy's argument that it was the dreadlocks that had in fact\n\ncaused  Barbosa  to  pick   Matthews's  picture  out  of  the\n\nphotograph books.   As  for the \"inconsistency\"  between when\n\nBarbosa  initially  told  police  she was  awakened  and  her\n\ntestimony  in  court,  we  note that  the  incident  report's\n\nstatement  that \"while  [Barbosa]  was  sleeping the  suspect\n\nentered  the victim's bedroom and jumped on  top of her\" is a\n\nhearsay account  of what  Barbosa said immediately  after the\r                   \n\nattack,  and, even if true, would only have deprived her of a\n\nfew  seconds of  the  time she  claimed  to have  viewed  her\n\nattacker.  She still was able to view him while he was on top\n\nof her; at various times while he searched the apartment; and\n\nwhen he returned  to Barbosa's  home on the  weekend.   Thus,\n\nD'Arcy's decision to eschew  questioning on these matters was\n\na sound trial tactic.\n\n          Finally,  we  address  the  grounds  on  which  the\n\ndistrict court  actually granted the writ:   D'Arcy's failure\n\nto  call John Wornum, or to request  a continuance so that he\n\ncould do so.   Here,  we disagree with  the district  court's\n\nconclusion;  we  cannot  see  how  Matthews  was  prejudiced.\n\nWornum's   testimony   would  have   corroborated  Matthews's\n\ntestimony  in general  --  i.e., that  there  actually was  a\n\nCrossing Auto  Body Shop,  and that Matthews  actually worked\n\nthere, and  perhaps even  that he  generally opened the  shop\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nearly in  the morning --  which would have taken  some of the\n\nwind out of  the sails of the prosecutor's  closing argument,\n\nin  which  he  cast  doubt  on  the  entirety  of  Matthews's\n\ntestimony.  Wornum's affidavit  makes clear, however, that he\n\ncould not provide an alibi for Matthews on the particular day\r                     \n\nof the crime.  Matthews argues that Wornum's testimony is all\n\nthe more credible  because he does not pretend  to be able to\n\nsay for  sure  where Matthews  was  on a  particular  morning\n\nseveral years  ago.   That may  be true, but  it is  far less\r                                          \n\nprobative of  Matthews's innocence.   Moreover, a  jury might\n\nhave drawn a negative inference from the things that Wornum's\n\naffidavit  does not  indicate he  is willing  to testify  to:\r                               \n\nnamely,  the identity  of the purchaser  of the  car Matthews\n\nsays he was  rebuilding around the time of the  crime, or any\n\nother  information  regarding the  car's  purchase  and sale.\n\nThus, while  Wornum's testimony might have  been, on balance,\n\nof  marginal  utility to  Matthews,  his  affidavit does  not\n\ncreate  in  us  any   belief  that  there  is  a   reasonable\n\nprobability that the outcome would have been different had he\n\ntestified.4\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  We  have also  considered Matthews's  claims that  he was\ndeprived  of  effective  assistance of  counsel  by  D'Arcy's\n\"incoherent\"  closing argument,  his lack of  preparation and\nhis overall  performance throughout the course  of the trial.\nEven  if Matthews  is  correct that  D'Arcy's performance  in\nthese areas was deficient, Matthews has not demonstrated, and\nthe  record  does not  lead  us to  believe,  that the  was a\nreasonable probability  of a different outcome  if D'Arcy had\nperformed differently.\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \n\n          For  the   foregoing  reasons,  we   conclude  that\n\nMatthews  was not  deprived of his  Sixth Amendment  right to\n\neffective  assistance of  counsel,  and the  decision of  the\n\ndistrict court is\n\n          Reversed.\r                      Reversed.\r                               \n\n                              Dissent follows.\r                                                         \n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.   I agree\r                      BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge\r                                                  \n\nwith  the majority that D'Arcy's failure to call John Wornum,\n\nwhen  examined  in  isolation,  did  not  violate  the  Sixth\n\nAmendment.     I  strongly   disagree,   however,  that   the\n\ncomplained-of acts  and decisions  of D'Arcy, when  viewed in\n\nthe aggregate,  \"f[ell] within  the wide range  of reasonable\n\nprofessional   assistance\"   and  constituted   \"sound  trial\n\nstrategy.\"  See Strickland v.  Washington, 466 U.S. 668,  689\r                                                     \n\n(1984).  Furthermore, I  am convinced that, but for  D'Arcy's\n\nunsound performance, \"there is a reasonable probability  that\n\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \n\nat  694.  I therefore dissent  from the majority opinion.  In\n\nexplaining my  dissent, I shall limit myself  to three points\n\nnot made  in the extremely thorough  and well-reasoned report\n\nand recommendation of  Magistrate Judge Bowler, the  relevant\n\nportion of which I attach as an appendix to my  dissent.  See\r                                                                         \n\nMatthews v.  Rakiey, Civil  Action No. 90-12111-WF  (D. Mass.\r                               \n\nfiled  March 17,  1993).   Magistrate Judge  Bowler's opinion\n\ncombines an accurate exposition  of the facts with  a correct\n\nstatement of the applicable legal principles.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\n          The   majority  opinion  makes  clear  that  D'Arcy\n\ndeclined to submit irrefutable evidence, readily available to\n\nhim,  that Barbosa waited eighty-one days  to report the rape\n\nand that Barbosa  testified untruthfully as to when she first\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\ninformed the police and  her sister-in-law that she  had been\n\nraped.     In  considering   whether  D'Arcy's  inaction  was\n\nsubstandard  under  Strickland's  first prong,  the  majority\r                                          \n\nemploys a  false assumption.   The majority  excuses D'Arcy's\n\ntactics  in   part  by  pointing   out  that  he   pursued  a\n\nmisidentification defense (the  \"dreadlocks defense\") and did\n\nnot really challenge  Barbosa's rape allegation.  See ante at\r                                                                      \n\n25  (\"Matthew's  primary defense  remained  that  Barbosa had\n\npicked out the wrong assailant, and not that she had not been\r                                \n\nattacked at all.  While Barbosa's delay in reporting that she\n\nwas  raped might have  affected the jury's  assessment of her\r                            \n\noverall credibility as a witness, we think this would be much\n\nmore likely if the primary issue had been consent.  Here, the\n\nprimary issue, and the heart of the defense's theory, was not\n\nwhether  a crime occurred but rather who committed it.\").  It\r                   \n\nthen   concludes    that,    in   the    context    of    the\n\nmisidentification/dreadlocks  defense,  D'Arcy's  failure  to\n\nexpose the glaring inconsistencies in Barbosa's testimony and\n\nprior statements was not \"beyond the wide range of reasonable\n\nprofessional assistance.\"  Id. at 25-26.\r                                          \n\n          Obviously, this  line of reasoning  tacitly assumes\n\nthe soundness  of D'Arcy's  decision not to  question whether\n\nBarbosa had  in fact been  raped.  Such an  assumption is not\n\nwarranted in this case for the following reasons.  First, the\n\ntwo  defenses would not have  been inconsistent.  There would\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nhave  been  nothing  inherently  suspect about  arguing  that\n\nBarbosa had identified  the wrong  man and that  she had  not\r                                                      \n\nbeen,  or  may  not have  been,  raped.    Second, there  was\n\nsignificant evidence tending  to undermine Barbosa's  account\n\nof the sexual assault.  Had  the jury been fully apprised  of\n\nthe  irregularities surrounding  the  reporting  of the  rape\n\ncharge,  it may well have concluded that it could not convict\n\nMatthews  of rape beyond  a reasonable doubt.   Third, D'Arcy\n\ndid  argue  to  the jury,  albeit  as  an  afterthought, that\r               \n\nBarbosa   may  not  have  been  raped.    See  id.  at  15-16\r                                                              \n\n(excerpting  portions of  closing argument where  D'Arcy asks\n\nthe jury to consider whether a  rape took place).  In view of\n\nthis  last  fact  alone,  I  am  puzzled  by  the  majority's\n\nconclusion  that D'Arcy's  refusal to  buttress his  argument\n\nwith significant supporting evidence constituted \"sound trial\n\ntactics.\"   D'Arcy ultimately thought  the \"rape may not have\n\nhappened\"  theory worth arguing;  how then could  it not have\n\nbeen worth supporting with evidence that was available?\n\n          I do not think that the existence of one reasonable\n\ndefense strategy, without more,  establishes constitutionally\n\neffective representation.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n          I  also  disagree  with  the  majority's conclusion\n\nthat, within the  confines of the misidentification/dreadlock\n\ndefense,   D'Arcy's   failure  to   impeach   Barbosa  passed\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\nconstitutional  muster.     The  case  hinged  on   Barbosa's\n\ncredibility as  a witness,  and I  simply do not  see how  it\n\ncould  have been \"sound\" for D'Arcy to fail to demonstrate to\n\nthe jury  that Barbosa had testified  untruthfully on several\n\nvery important matters (including when she first informed the\n\npolice  and her sister-in-law that  she had been  raped).  He\n\ncertainly  could   have  done  so  sensitively   and  without\n\nsuggesting improper  motive on  Barbosa's part.   The omitted\n\nimpeachment evidence  could  have been  easily introduced  as\n\nfurther  confirmation  of  that  which  D'Arcy  had   already\n\nsuggested to  the jury:  the  trauma of awakening to  find an\n\nintruder  in  the  room  quite  reasonably  rendered  suspect\n\nBarbosa's powers of perception and recall.\n\n          This  leads to a second point.  The majority, in my\n\nopinion, gives too much credence to certain ageist and sexist\n\nassumptions -- that  it would be improper to question closely\n\n(and  risk arousing the  emotions of)  a young  female sexual\n\nassault  victim, and  that  the jury  cannot  rise above  its\n\nsympathy for young female  sexual assault victims and  do its\n\nassigned job  -- that  heavily informed  D'Arcy's performance\n\nand  decision-making.     Along  these  lines,   I  note  the\n\nmajority's  conclusion  that  Barbosa's  age  \"render[s]  her\n\nfailure  to   report  the  rape  immediately   all  the  more\n\nexplicable.\"   Id.  at  25.   The  explicability vel  non  of\r                                                                     \n\nBarbosa's  failure to report the  rape immediately -- as well\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nas  Barbosa's failure  to testify  truthfully about  when she\n\nfirst reported  the rape  -- had vital  bearing on  Barbosa's\n\ncredibility.    It  should  have  been  left  to  the  jury's\n\nconsideration after argument  by counsel.   In my opinion,  a\n\nreviewing court has no business explaining this failure away,\n\nwithout   citation    to   supporting   authority,    as   an\n\nunderstandable by-product of youth.\n\n          While  counsel must tread  carefully in questioning\n\nthe alleged  victim in  cases such  as  this, counsel  cannot\n\nabdicate  the  constitutional responsibilities  of  a defense\n\nattorney.  The record amply demonstrates that D'Arcy was more\n\nconcerned  with  the  young  victim's  emotional  state  than\n\nproviding his client  with a vigorous  defense, and that  his\n\nhands-off  approach to  the case  led to  a constitutionally-\n\ndefective performance.  The sentiments that prompted D'Arcy's\n\nineffectiveness may be understandable.  They cannot, however,\n\nbe tolerated in our criminal justice system.\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \n\n          The  majority opinion  does  not  discuss  D'Arcy's\n\nfailure to  object to the prosecutor's  closing argument, and\n\nMagistrate Judge  Bowler evaluates this failure  only insofar\n\nas the argument  mischaracterized the evidence.   I think  it\n\nimportant to note that the closing contained both an improper\n\nappeal  to  the jury  to act  other  than as  a dispassionate\n\narbiter of the  facts and an improper and inflammatory appeal\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\nto  the  jury's  emotions.    Neither  type  of  argument  is\n\npermissible.   See, e.g.,  United States v.  Manning, 23 F.3d\r                                                                \n\n570, 573 (1st Cir. 1994) (prosecutor  may not ask jury to act\n\nother than as a dispassionate arbiter of the facts); Arrieta-\r                                                                         \n\nAgressot  v. United States, 3  F.3d 525, 527  (1st Cir. 1993)\r                                      \n\n(prosecutor may  not inflame  the prejudices and  passions of\n\nthe jury).\n\n          Here,  the prosecutor  told the  jury:   \"Keep that\n\npicture  of [Barbosa] in your mind.  Those were not crocodile\n\ntears  that came out of  her eyes.   Those were genuine tears\n\nbased  on honesty and certainty.  Brenda Barbosa came to this\n\ncourt to seek justice, and you  can give her justice.  She is\n\nthe victim.\"  See ante at 17.  Perhaps because the concept of\r                                  \n\n\"tears of certainty\"  is new to me, I regard  the first three\n\nsentences   of   the  quotation   as  an   ill-concealed  and\n\ninflammatory entreaty for  jury sympathy.   And the last  two\n\nsentences  of  the  quotation  are  at  worst an  appeal  for\n\nvengeance  and at best a  request that the  jury do something\n\nother than dispassionately judge the facts for itself.\n\n          In  a case  as close  as  this one,  these improper\n\narguments  could  have  made  a real  difference.    D'Arcy's\n\nfailure to object to them was  another error in the long line\n\nof trial mistakes that show his incompetency beyond cavil.\n\n                       Appendix Follows\r                                   Appendix Follows\n\n                             -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n",

After exhausting his remedies in the state courts, Matthews sought a writ of habeas corpus in the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254, claiming that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.  After referring the matter to a magistrate-judge for a report and recommendation, the district court granted the petition, and this appeal followed.  For the reasons discussed below, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>A. Pretrial Events</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 15, 1986, Brenda Barbosa, who was fourteen years old at the time, reported to Boston police that she had been attacked in her bedroom by a man with a knife earlier that morning.  Later that same day, after viewing several hundred photographs in police identification books, Barbosa identified Matthews, who wears his hair in a distinctive \"dreadlocks\" style and was so depicted in the photograph, as the man who had attacked her.  The police obtained an arrest warrant but, although they knew Matthews's address, made no immediate attempt to question him about the incident or take him into custody.  Matthews was eventually arrested on May 28, 1986, when a patrolling officer who had stopped to question Matthews on the street about unrelated conduct discovered the outstanding warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident report filed by the Boston police officer who first responded to Barbosa's call (the \"incident report\") contains no mention of a sexual assault.  The officer's account of his interview with Barbosa, conducted within two hours of the incident, is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>[T]he victim ... stated while she was sleeping the suspect entered the victim's bedroom and jumped on top of her.  The victim stated the suspect had a kitchen knife and told her, \"Be quiet, I don't want nothing from you, you won't get hurt.\"   The victim further stated the suspect then pulled the victim from her bed and ordered the victim to stand in a corner then the suspect ordered the victim to stand against a wall.  The victim then stated the suspect started looking through the rooms on all three floors.  The victim further stated the suspect then told the victim to close the door behind him when he left and not to tell anyone about him.  The victim stated she complied and the suspect fled on foot to a yellow m/v then fled in an unknown direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident report includes a description of the alleged assailant as a black male, 5'10\", black hair and brown eyes, wearing a black hat, brown leather jacket and black pants.  It does not indicate whether Barbosa mentioned to the officer that her attacker had dreadlocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matthews was initially charged with armed assault in a dwelling with intent to commit a felony, and with breaking and entering.  A probable cause hearing was conducted in Roxbury District Court on August 4, 1986.  There is no transcript of the hearing in the record.  Although the breaking and entering charge was dropped following the hearing, Matthews was bound over on the armed assault charge.  Subsequently, grand jury proceedings were initiated on that charge as well as two new charges apparently based on Barbosa's testimony at the probable cause hearing:  rape of a child with force, and indecent assault and battery on a person under 14.  At the grand jury proceeding, Boston Police Detective William Ingersoll--who oversaw the photo identification procedure in which Barbosa picked out Matthews--testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A. ... At the probable cause hearing in the Roxbury Court I was not present ... and I received a message following that hearing from the District Attorney who stated to me that during the probable cause hearing the victim--who was afraid to tell her mother and the police--that at the time during this breaking and entering and assault, the defendant did assault this young girl, again, 14 years of age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Q.

She did not go to the hospital to be examined.  Again, she is a young Spanish girl and was ashamed even to tell the mother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no complaints at that time for rape in the Roxbury District Court against him.

Well, I was sleeping and I heard the bedroom door, and when I looked up I seen this man and he jumped on top of me and put me against the wall....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Q.

I don't really know, but he must have took it because I couldn't find it;  I looked for it;  I asked my sister if she let someone use it;  she said, no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Q. Now, when this man jumped on you, did he touch you in any way?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>A. Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Q. And what part of your body did he touch?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>A. He touched me, all parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Q.

Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>Q. When the police came that day, did you tell the police that day?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>A. I told them everything that happened, like in a way I was--when I went to the police station to look at the pictures I told them what happened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 17, 1987, Matthews was brought to trial on the rape, armed assault and indecent assault charges.  The prosecution called two witnesses, Barbosa and Ingersoll, with Matthews as the only defense witness.  Because we must evaluate the alleged constitutional deficiencies of counsel's performance in light of his \"overall performance throughout the case,\" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), we provide an extensive summary of the trial record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Opening Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that immediately after Barbosa's attacker left her apartment, Barbosa ran next door \"and told her sister-in-law what had happened.\"   Despite strong evidence that Barbosa never told anyone that she had been sexually assaulted or raped until she testified at Matthews's probable cause hearing, 81 days after the incident, Matthews's trial counsel, Kenneth D'Arcy, did not challenge the prosecutor's assertions.  D'Arcy made clear from the outset that instead of challenging Barbosa's allegations, he would try to show that she had mistakenly picked Matthews out of the police photograph books because of his distinctive \"dreadlocks\" hairstyle.  D'Arcy told the jury that \"[t]here's no question in my mind and Mr. Matthews' mind that Brenda Barbosa was attacked in her bedroom on May 15th.  But you're going to hear from Mr. Matthews that on May 15th he was working in his father's garage.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Barbosa's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbosa, who had reached sixteen years of age by the time of the trial, testified on direct examination that she was asleep in her bed about 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986, when she was awakened by a man entering her room.  When she looked up, she saw the man had a knife.  The man got on top of her, put the knife to her throat and told her to be quiet or he would kill her.  The man touched Barbosa's breasts and put his finger inside Barbosa's vagina.  Then, the man pulled Barbosa off the bed and placed her against a wall, telling her to stay there while he walked through other rooms of the house.  Barbosa said he took her leather coat, although she did not say whether she saw him carry the coat away.  Barbosa identified Matthews as the man who attacked her.  The following exchange then ensued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>Q. You went to your sister-in-law's;  did you tell her what happened?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>A. Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>Q. Did you call the police?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>A. Yes, I did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Q. You reported this to the police, didn't you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>A. Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>Q. Now, at some point during the day did you have an opportunity to meet with Detective Ingersoll of the Boston Police?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>A. Yes, I did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>Q. Did you go over what happened with him?   Did you tell him about that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>A. Yes, I did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbosa then testified as to how she picked Matthews's photograph out of the police books.  She said that she got a good look at her attacker's face;  that her attacker had long hair pinned up under a gray beret-like hat;  and that she had described the man to police as being about five-foot-eleven with dreadlocks and a hat.  Barbosa also testified that a few days after the attack, the same man came to her door and rang the doorbell.  She said that she \"went crazy, and ... started crying, and he just left.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his cross-examination, D'Arcy quickly began his attempt to show that Barbosa had immediately zeroed in on the fact that the assailant had dreadlocks:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Q. This man came in, and what's the first thing you remember about his physical appearance when you saw him in your bedroom?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>A. I don't really understand what you mean.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>Q. What was the first physical characteristic that you saw in this man when you saw him in the bedroom and he woke you up and you were afraid;  what's the first thing you recognized about him?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>A. The knife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>Q. And then what about a physical characteristic?   After you saw the knife, and you saw this man with the knife, what physical characteristic did you remember?A. I still don't understand what you mean.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>Q. When you describe people--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>A.  Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>Q. --you describe people as short--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>A.  Oh, you want me to describe him, like when he first came in?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>Q. Yes, when you first saw this man and you saw the knife, and you got over the shock of the knife, and you saw that this man was in your bedroom and he didn't belong there--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>A.  Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>Q. --what physical characteristic of this man did you first remember--first remember?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>A. The way he looked, his face, and the way he was like coming towards me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>Q. What about his hair style?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>A. I recognized that too.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>Q. The dreadlocks?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>A. Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Arcy then questioned Barbosa about her identification of Matthews as her attacker.  He elicited the not-too-helpful testimony that she had seen other people with dreadlocks before encountering Matthews, but that they did not look like him;  that she identified Matthews the same day as the alleged attack;  that she \"could never forget his face\";  and that she had picked the picture out after viewing it for just half a second.  Before he concluded this line of questioning, D'Arcy inartfully allowed Barbosa one more opportunity to tell the jury how certain she was of her identification of Matthews:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>Q. There's no question in your mind that this is the man that broke into your house and had a knife in his hand?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>A. That's the man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, D'Arcy changed the focus of his examination and began to question Barbosa's account of what had happened and her veracity:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>Q. Then did you tell Detective Ingersoll at that time, you know, that he touched your private parts at all?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>A. I told him what had happened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p>Q. Well, did you tell him, you know, as you told the jury today, that the man grabbed your private parts?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>A. I only told him what he was asking me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p>Q. Is it fair to say, Brenda, that you really didn't tell Detective Ingersoll everything that happened when you were going over the pictures?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>A. I told him most everything that happened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p>Q. But you didn't tell him about the fact that this man touched your private parts?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>A. No, but I told the other cops when they came.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>Q. When?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>A. When it first happened, the cops that came over to the house.  It's right in the report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>Q. You told them that he had grabbed you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>A. Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>Q. And touched your private parts, right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>A. Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these last four answers were apparently untrue, D'Arcy did not directly confront Barbosa with any prior statements or other evidence contradicting her testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Ingersoll's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingersoll testified that Barbosa and her sister-in-law, Carmen Barbosa, came to his office on the afternoon of May 15 to view photographs.  Ingersoll said he \"tried to determine what exactly had happened\" and then began showing Barbosa books containing photographs of black men of the approximate age that Barbosa had described.  Ingersoll testified that, in his estimation, Barbosa viewed \"about 600, 700 photographs.\"   When she turned to the photograph of Matthews, Ingersoll said, Barbosa \"became very excited.  'That's him.'   She got up from the table, jumping up and down.  'That's him, that's him.' \"   Ingersoll said that the picture of Matthews matched the general description contained in the original incident report, and that during her conversation with Ingersoll prior to viewing the photographs, Barbosa had mentioned that the attacker had dreadlocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, D'Arcy resumed his strategy of trying to show that Barbosa had picked out Matthews's picture because of his dreadlocks:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>Q. Now, when Brenda Barbosa came in the station, she gave you a description of the man that was in her home earlier, had dreadlocks;  do you remember?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>A. That's correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>Q. You don't have any books or just males with dreadlocks, though;  right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>A. No, sir.  The space just doesn't allow it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>Q. Did you look at any of the photos that she looked at, looking for men with dreadlocks?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p>A. Not at that particular time, no, sir.  I basically put a lot of the photographs in the books when we receive them for identification.  I don't make a special notice of dreadlocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p>Q. Do you know how many men had dreadlocks in the photos before Miss Barbosa picked Lloyd Matthews' picture?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p>A. I have no idea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>Q. It could have been any of them?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>A. It could have been any, could have been a few, could have been one.  I don't know.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>Q. Could have been one, right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p>A. The books are set up, Mr. D'Arcy, only by age, sex and race;  that's it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p>Q. So you're testifying today that Mr. Matthews could have been the first male that had dreadlocks in those photo books;  correct, Detective?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>A. Could have been.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon further questioning by D'Arcy, Ingersoll testified that he \"kn[e]w for a fact that there are many dreadlocks\" in the photograph books, and that he had \"had every confidence in the world that she would run into dreadlocks.\"   He also testified that he did not personally arrest Matthews, nor did he immediately have police officers go to Matthews's home to arrest him once an arrest warrant issued.  Instead, Ingersoll said, he told another police officer with duty in Matthews's neighborhood of the warrant, and that officer told Ingersoll \"that he would lock him up when he sees him.\"   Matthews was ultimately arrested when police stopped to question him on a Roxbury street on May 28, nine days after the warrant had issued and thirteen days after the crimes allegedly took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. The Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the prosecution rested, D'Arcy notified the court that Matthews was \"very upset\" with D'Arcy for not wanting to recall Barbosa to the stand to question her about discrepancies between her trial testimony and prior statements.  D'Arcy told the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>But in my perusal of the grand jury minutes, I mean--you know, this is an identity type of case, your Honor.  I know what the girl has been through.  It's obvious that a crime was committed.  My client's defense is that it's a misidentity.  She testified there was no question in her mind it was him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether she came downstairs with him or looked out the window, there's sort of minor discrepancies as far as I'm concerned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It's a disadvantage when you try to examine young ladies because of the fact that she's highly emotional.  I just feel--I disagree with my client.  I told him I didn't want to recall Brenda Barbosa.  You know, the bottom line is that I'm trying the case and he isn't.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But I just want the record to reflect that, you know, he's been more than vociferous that he doesn't agree with my strategy, shall we say.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Arcy then called Matthews to the stand.  Matthews testified that he had worked at his \"father\" John Wornum's<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> auto body shop in Roxbury on and off for years.  From April until July of 1986, Matthews testified, he and a friend, Chris Cross, were rebuilding a junked car that they eventually sold to a friend of Wornum.  Matthews could not say specifically that he was working at the shop on the morning of May 15, 1986, but he said that it was his usual practice to open up the shop each morning at 7:30 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Matthews explained that he was paid in cash and had no records or pay stubs proving that he worked at the body shop.  John Wornum, Matthews testified, had been in Georgia for several months;  Wornum's son, Rufus Wornum, was busy running the shop, and Chris Cross had agreed to testify on his behalf but had since joined the Marines.  Matthews also testified that he had no records pertaining to the rebuilt car, and that he did not know the person who bought it other than that he was a friend of John Wornum.  The prosecutor's final exchange with Matthews was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>Q. You're not specifically testifying as to where you were on the morning of May 15th, 1986;  are you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p>A. No, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike his opening, D'Arcy's summation contained at least some hints to the jury that perhaps Barbosa's story of what happened to her was not entirely truthful.  After incorrectly telling the jury that they had \"seen a girl fourteen years old,\" D'Arcy urged the jurors not to let their emotions affect their deliberations about</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p>what happened to this girl, if in fact it did happen....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have to decide did Brenda Barbosa really tell the truth of everything that happened.  Did she wake up and see a fellow there with a knife?   Was it somebody maybe she--she didn't go to school that day--that maybe a fellow that she was going to go to school with--maybe something got carried on that she didn't expect and she panicked, because she lived right--a relative lived right around the corner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Did it happen to her?   Did she tell Officer Ingersoll that she had been sexually assaulted?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Arcy did not, however, point to any evidence or prior statements suggesting that Barbosa was not truthful.  Instead, he discussed at length how a \"hysterical\" Barbosa had zeroed in on Matthews's photograph \"[a]s soon as she saw the dreadlocks,\" and how the failure of the police to arrest Matthews as soon as Barbosa had identified him was not \"fair play.\"   The near-two-week delay in Matthews's arrest left Matthews virtually no chance to prove that he was at the body shop while Barbosa allegedly was attacked, D'Arcy argued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Toward the end of his argument, D'Arcy again suggested that this was not just a case of mistaken identity, but also of truthfulness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Did you hear any hospital testimony regarding any physical disability with Brenda Barbosa?   Because I suggest she didn't tell anybody the day she picked out Mr. Matthews' picture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Did you hear any evidence of a lock being broken or of any damage to her house that allowed this stranger to come in?   No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">And again:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest that all of these gaps create some doubt, and that's the magic word, \"doubt\", beyond a reasonable doubt.  That's what you have to be convinced, that Lloyd Matthews was the individual that came into a room, and if in fact there was a breaking and entering, and indecently assaulted Brenda Barbosa, if in fact she was, and stuck his finger in her vagina, if in fact that was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because I suggest a fourteen year old that this has really happened to, when she went running out to her relation, she would have said, \"I've been violated,\" and she would have been brought right to the hospital for examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You know, fourteen years old, if this is what happened.  Then from the hospital the police would have got up there, and then maybe if she had told all the truth right away they would have picked up or investigated Lloyd Matthews that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had that occurred, D'Arcy argued, Matthews could have proved where he was the morning of May 15 and refuted the notion that he was the dreadlocked man who had attacked Barbosa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor recounted how certain Barbosa was of her identification and the substantial opportunity she had had to see him when he entered her room and was on top of her.  He told the jury to consider \"the sincerity of her emotions\" in testifying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keep that picture of her in your mind.  Those were not crocodile tears that came out of her eyes.  Those were genuine tears based on honesty and certainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brenda Barbosa came to this court to seek justice, and you can give her justice.  She is the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to Barbosa's sincerity, the prosecutor pointed to the \"vague\" nature of Matthews's testimony:  \"That he worked at a vague garage, working on a vague Lincoln, making vague repairs.  Nothing to back it up.\"   In the end, the prosecutor said, the issue for the jury was one of credibility:  \"You have to make a determination of who to believe;  who was honest;  who was sincere;  who was certain;  and who was vague.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury deliberated for about four-and-one-half hours before returning verdicts of guilty on all three counts.  Matthews was sentenced to concurrent state prison terms of 12 to 20 years, 10 to 15 years, and 4 to 5 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Post-Conviction Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matthews moved for a new trial on a number of grounds, including ineffective assistance of counsel and newly discovered evidence--namely, an affidavit from John Wornum to the effect that he would corroborate Matthews's testimony that in May 1986, he normally opened the body shop at 7:30 in the morning, and that on May 15, 1986, Matthews \"would have been working\" at the shop when Barbosa was allegedly attacked.  The trial court denied the motion.  The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the conviction, and the Supreme Judicial Court denied Matthews's petition to obtain further appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having exhausted his state remedies, Matthews filed his petition for habeas corpus in the district court on August 30, 1990.  Matthews argued that D'Arcy committed numerous errors that deprived him of effective assistance of counsel:  1) failure to impeach Brenda Barbosa with her prior inconsistent statements;  2) failure to make an effective closing argument;  3) failure to have Matthews's only alibi witness, John Wornum, appear and testify at trial;  and 4) failure to prepare adequately for trial and to object to improper leading questions and to the prosecutor's closing argument.  The respondent argued that D'Arcy's alleged \"errors\" were tactical or strategic choices made so as not to undermine D'Arcy's strategy of pursuing the \"dreadlocks\" defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An evidentiary hearing was convened on January 15, 1993, but neither party chose to present evidence beyond that already contained in the record.  On March 17, 1993, a United States Magistrate Judge agreed with virtually all of Matthews's assertions and, finding that \"the culmination of errors taken as a whole ... establishes trial counsel's ineffective assistance in this case,\" recommended that the writ be allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the magistrate-judge's recommended result but not her reasoning.  The court found that D'Arcy had adopted a professionally responsible strategy by not contesting that Barbosa was sexually assaulted by a black man with dreadlocks and by seeking instead to suggest that, in her subsequent hysteria, she mistakenly selected Matthews's photograph because his was the first picture of a man with dreadlocks.  The court held that because D'Arcy relied on the mistaken-identity defense, however, his failure to investigate Matthews's only alibi witness, John Wornum, or to seek a continuance in order to do so, was not ascribable to any strategic reason and therefore constituted constitutionally deficient assistance of counsel that prejudiced Matthews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent appealed, arguing that Wornum's affidavit contained no indication that his testimony would provide an alibi for Matthews.  Matthews filed two briefs pro se, one as appellee urging that we affirm the district court's order, and another as appellant asking that we grant the petition on the grounds recommended by the magistrate-judge but rejected by the district court.II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Governing Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a Sixth Amendment violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show:  (1) that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness;  and (2) that prejudice resulted.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984);  Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 940, 130 L.Ed.2d 885 (1995).  Among the basic duties of an attorney is \"to bring to bear such skill and knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial testing process.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the reasonableness of an attorney's performance, we \"indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance;  that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy.' \"  Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065 (quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 164, 100 L.Ed. 83 (1955)).  We must make \"every effort ... to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight\" and to evaluate counsel's conduct from his or her perspective under the circumstances as they existed at that time.

Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. D'Arcy's Performance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matthews concedes that the central issue in the case was the identity of the attacker.  What he challenges is D'Arcy's decision to use the \"dreadlocks\" defense to attempt to persuade the jury that Barbosa had misidentified Matthews, rather than focusing on the apparent inconsistencies of her prior statements and her failure to report the alleged rape immediately.  D'Arcy's decision to employ the dreadlocks strategy was not a professionally reasonable choice, Matthews claims, because D'Arcy possessed no evidence that Barbosa had picked Matthews's photograph out because of his hairstyle.  D'Arcy had no knowledge of how many pictures of men with dreadlocks Barbosa had seen before identifying Matthews, and the police report contains no indication that Barbosa had mentioned dreadlocks in her initial description of the attacker, thus undermining the argument that the hairstyle was the predominant feature.  Therefore, Matthews argues, instead of concealing the fact that Barbosa did not mention dreadlocks initially, D'Arcy should have driven this point home to the jury and called into question Barbosa's powers of observation.  Furthermore, Matthews maintains, D'Arcy should have questioned Barbosa about the discrepancy between the police report's version of when she initially saw her attacker, and her own testimony--i.e., whether she was awakened by a man entering her bedroom and jumping on top of her, or whether she heard the door, and thus had a longer time to view her attacker--and he should have called into question Barbosa's truthfulness generally by impeaching her regarding her delay in reporting the alleged rape.  Finally, Matthews argues, D'Arcy should have marshalled an effective closing argument underscoring the inconsistencies in Barbosa's prior statements, rather than delivering a disjointed speech that, Matthews claims, bordered on an invitation to convict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree that D'Arcy's strategic choice to employ the \"dreadlocks defense\" was professionally unreasonable.  That it was not ultimately a winning strategy is of no moment in assessing its reasonableness at the time, see United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 310 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1079, 112 S.Ct. 986, 117 L.Ed.2d 148 (1992).  D'Arcy had little to work with, given the persuasive power of Barbosa's identification testimony and the inherent weakness of Matthews's alibi, and he chose what he thought was a reasonable line of argument that carried with it little risk of alienating the jury.  A strategic choice that would have included more direct attacks on Barbosa's credibility and, inevitably, her character, would have carried with it a far greater risk of offending the jury.  Thus, we hold that, in choosing to emphasize Matthews's dreadlocks as the reason that Barbosa identified him as her attacker, rather than highlighting alleged inconsistencies in Barbosa's trial testimony and her prior statements, D'Arcy employed a professionally reasonable strategy and did not, by virtue of that choice alone, deprive Matthews of effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matthews also argues, however, that D'Arcy did in fact challenge Barbosa's credibility--by questioning her about her apparent failure to report immediately that she was raped, and by arguing this point to the jury--and that therefore D'Arcy's failure to impeach Barbosa more directly, or at least to introduce the impeaching evidence through another witness, cannot be deemed a strategic choice.  We agree that the record makes clear that D'Arcy did attempt to elicit from Barbosa an admission that she did not immediately report the rape.  Indeed, D'Arcy successfully forced Barbosa to change her testimony and admit that she had not, in fact, told Detective Ingersoll about the rape.  The question we must address, however, is whether, once Barbosa went on to testify that she had told the police who had initially responded to her call that she was raped, and that \"it's right in the report,\" D'Arcy's failure to demonstrate to the jury that these statements were apparently untrue constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.  Put another way, the issue is whether it may be considered acceptable trial strategy to have questioned Barbosa about her delay in reporting the rape without impeaching her when the answers she gave were not favorable to Matthews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bearing in mind that the defendant must overcome \"a strong presumption\" that D'Arcy's conduct \"falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, we are unable to come to any conclusion other than that Matthews has not done so here.  To be sure, there were points to be scored against Barbosa's credibility after she insisted that she had in fact immediately told police that she had been raped.  D'Arcy could have confronted her with the incident report containing no mention of a rape, or he could have asked her about her testimony at the probable cause hearing.  He also could have questioned Ingersoll about when he first learned that Barbosa claimed to have been raped.  But, as D'Arcy made clear to the trial judge at a sidebar conference following the close of the prosecution's case, Matthews's primary defense remained that Barbosa had picked out the wrong assailant, and not that she had not been attacked at all.  While Barbosa's delay in reporting that she was raped might have affected the jury's assessment of her overall credibility as a witness, we think this would be much more likely if the primary issue had been consent.  Here, the primary issue, and the heart of the defense's theory, was not whether a crime occurred but rather who committed it.  Moreover, the record makes apparent that Barbosa was quite obviously upset on the witness stand as she retold her experience;  this circumstance, along with Barbosa's youth (rendering her failure to report a rape immediately all the more explicable), diminishes the likelihood that the jury would doubt that such an attack occurred simply because Barbosa delayed in reporting it.  D'Arcy had to balance the limited evidentiary value of Barbosa's delay against the danger of the jury misperceiving an impeachment attempt as badgering or callously tarnishing Barbosa.  Another lawyer might have struck a different balance, but we do not find that D'Arcy's on-the-spot decision to let Barbosa's answer stand and argue the inference he had raised to the jury was \"beyond the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other alleged inconsistencies in Barbosa's statements that Matthews claims D'Arcy should have raised are trivial, and thus D'Arcy's decision not to question Barbosa about them was a sound tactical choice.  That the incident report, prepared immediately after the attack, contains no mention of dreadlocks, is inconsequential in light of the fact that Barbosa told Ingersoll before viewing any photographs that her attacker had dreadlocks.  Furthermore, to point out this \"inconsistency\" would have only weakened D'Arcy's argument that it was the dreadlocks that had in fact caused Barbosa to pick Matthews's picture out of the photograph books.  As for the \"inconsistency\" between when Barbosa initially told police she was awakened and her testimony in court, we note that the incident report's statement that \"while [Barbosa] was sleeping the suspect entered the victim's bedroom and jumped on top of her\" is a hearsay account of what Barbosa said immediately after the attack, and, even if true, would only have deprived her of a few seconds of the time she claimed to have viewed her attacker.  She still was able to view him while he was on top of her;  at various times while he searched the apartment;  and when he returned to Barbosa's home on the weekend.  Thus, D'Arcy's decision to eschew questioning on these matters was a sound trial tactic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address the grounds on which the district court actually granted the writ:  D'Arcy's failure to call John Wornum, or to request a continuance so that he could do so.  Here, we disagree with the district court's conclusion;  we cannot see how Matthews was prejudiced.  Wornum's testimony would have corroborated Matthews's testimony in general--i.e., that there actually was a Crossing Auto Body Shop, and that Matthews actually worked there, and perhaps even that he generally opened the shop early in the morning--which would have taken some of the wind out of the sails of the prosecutor's closing argument, in which he cast doubt on the entirety of Matthews's testimony.  Wornum's affidavit makes clear, however, that he could not provide an alibi for Matthews on the particular day of the crime.  Matthews argues that Wornum's testimony is all the more credible because he does not pretend to be able to say for sure where Matthews was on a particular morning several years ago.  That may be true, but it is far less probative of Matthews's innocence.  Moreover, a jury might have drawn a negative inference from the things that Wornum's affidavit does not indicate he is willing to testify to:  namely, the identity of the purchaser of the car Matthews says he was rebuilding around the time of the crime, or any other information regarding the car's purchase and sale.  Thus, while Wornum's testimony might have been, on balance, of marginal utility to Matthews, his affidavit does not create in us any belief that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different had he testified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Matthews was not deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, and the decision of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with the majority that D'Arcy's failure to call John Wornum, when examined in isolation, did not violate the Sixth Amendment.  I strongly disagree, however, that the complained of acts and decisions of D'Arcy, when viewed in the aggregate, \"f[ell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\" and constituted \"sound trial strategy.\"   See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).  Furthermore, I am convinced that, but for D'Arcy's unsound performance, \"there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.   I therefore dissent from the majority opinion.  In explaining my dissent, I shall limit myself to three points not made in the extremely thorough and well-reasoned report and recommendation of Magistrate Judge Bowler, the relevant portion of which I attach as an appendix to my dissent.  See Matthews v. Rakiey, Civil Action No. 90-12111-WF (D.Mass. filed March 17, 1993).  Magistrate Judge Bowler's opinion combines an accurate exposition of the facts with a correct statement of the applicable legal principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion makes clear that D'Arcy declined to submit irrefutable evidence, readily available to him, that Barbosa waited eighty-one days to report the rape and that Barbosa testified untruthfully as to when she first informed the police and her sister-in-law that she had been raped.  In considering whether D'Arcy's inaction was substandard under Strickland 's first prong, the majority employs a false assumption.  The majority excuses D'Arcy's tactics in part by pointing out that he pursued a misidentification defense (the \"dreadlocks defense\") and did not really challenge Barbosa's rape allegation.  See ante at 917 (\"Matthew's primary defense remained that Barbosa had picked out the wrong assailant, and not that she had not been attacked at all.  While Barbosa's delay in reporting that she was raped might have affected the jury's assessment of her overall credibility as a witness, we think this would be much more likely if the primary issue had been consent.  Here, the primary issue, and the heart of the defense's theory, was not whether a crime occurred but rather who committed it.\").  It then concludes that, in the context of the misidentification/dreadlocks defense, D'Arcy's failure to expose the glaring inconsistencies in Barbosa's testimony and prior statements was not \"beyond the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"   Id. at 917-18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, this line of reasoning tacitly assumes the soundness of D'Arcy's decision not to question whether Barbosa had in fact been raped.  Such an assumption is not warranted in this case for the following reasons.  First, the two defenses would not have been inconsistent.  There would have been nothing inherently suspect about arguing that Barbosa had identified the wrong man and that she had not been, or may not have been, raped.  Second, there was significant evidence tending to undermine Barbosa's account of the sexual assault.  Had the jury been fully apprised of the irregularities surrounding the reporting of the rape charge, it may well have concluded that it could not convict Matthews of rape beyond a reasonable doubt.  Third, D'Arcy did argue to the jury, albeit as an afterthought, that Barbosa may not have been raped.  See id. at 914 (excerpting portions of closing argument where D'Arcy asks the jury to consider whether a rape took place).  In view of this last fact alone, I am puzzled by the majority's conclusion that D'Arcy's refusal to buttress his argument with significant supporting evidence constituted \"sound trial tactics.\"   D'Arcy ultimately thought the \"rape may not have happened\" theory worth arguing;  how then could it not have been worth supporting with evidence that was available?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not think that the existence of one reasonable defense strategy, without more, establishes constitutionally effective representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also disagree with the majority's conclusion that, within the confines of the misidentification/dreadlock defense, D'Arcy's failure to impeach Barbosa passed constitutional muster.  The case hinged on Barbosa's credibility as a witness, and I simply do not see how it could have been \"sound\" for D'Arcy to fail to demonstrate to the jury that Barbosa had testified untruthfully on several very important matters (including when she first informed the police and her sister-in-law that she had been raped).  He certainly could have done so sensitively and without suggesting improper motive on Barbosa's part.  The omitted impeachment evidence could have been easily introduced as further confirmation of that which D'Arcy had already suggested to the jury:  the trauma of awakening to find an intruder in the room quite reasonably rendered suspect Barbosa's powers of perception and recall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to a second point.  The majority, in my opinion, gives too much credence to certain ageist and sexist assumptions--that it would be improper to question closely (and risk arousing the emotions of) a young female sexual assault victim, and that the jury cannot rise above its sympathy for young female sexual assault victims and do its assigned job--that heavily informed D'Arcy's performance and decision-making.  Along these lines, I note the majority's conclusion that Barbosa's age \"render[s] her failure to report the rape immediately all the more explicable.\"   Id. at 917.  The explicability vel non of Barbosa's failure to report the rape immediately--as well as Barbosa's failure to testify truthfully about when she first reported the rape--had vital bearing on Barbosa's credibility.  It should have been left to the jury's consideration after argument by counsel.  In my opinion, a reviewing court has no business explaining this failure away, without citation to supporting authority, as an understandable by-product of youth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While counsel must tread carefully in questioning the alleged victim in cases such as this, counsel cannot abdicate the constitutional responsibilities of a defense attorney.  The record amply demonstrates that D'Arcy was more concerned with the young victim's emotional state than providing his client with a vigorous defense, and that his hands-off approach to the case led to a constitutionally-defective performance.  The sentiments that prompted D'Arcy's ineffectiveness may be understandable.  They cannot, however, be tolerated in our criminal justice system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion does not discuss D'Arcy's failure to object to the prosecutor's closing argument, and Magistrate Judge Bowler evaluates this failure only insofar as the argument mischaracterized the evidence.  I think it important to note that the closing contained both an improper appeal to the jury to act other than as a dispassionate arbiter of the facts and an improper and inflammatory appeal to the jury's emotions.  Neither type of argument is permissible.  See, e.g., United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 573 (1st Cir.1994) (prosecutor may not ask jury to act other than as a dispassionate arbiter of the facts);  Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, 3 F.3d 525, 527 (1st Cir.1993) (prosecutor may not inflame the prejudices and passions of the jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the prosecutor told the jury:  \"Keep that picture of [Barbosa] in your mind.  Those were not crocodile tears that came out of her eyes.  Those were genuine tears based on honesty and certainty.  Brenda Barbosa came to this court to seek justice, and you can give her justice.  She is the victim.\"   See ante at 915.  Perhaps because the concept of \"tears of certainty\" is new to me, I regard the first three sentences of the quotation as an ill-concealed and inflammatory entreaty for jury sympathy.  And the last two sentences of the quotation are at worst an appeal for vengeance and at best a request that the jury do something other than dispassionately judge the facts for itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case as close as this one, these improper arguments could have made a real difference.  D'Arcy's failure to object to them was another error in the long line of trial mistakes that show his incompetency beyond cavil.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <p>United States District Court</p>\n    <p>District of Massachusetts</p>\n    <p>LLOYD MATTHEWS, Petitioner,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p>v.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p>PAUL RAKIEY, Superintendent at M.C.I.-Walpole, Respondent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p>Civil Action No. 90-12111-WF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p>REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION RE: PETITIONER'S WRIT OF HABEAS</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CORPUS (DOCKET ENTRY # 23)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p>March 17, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWLER, United States Magistrate Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony at trial, taken from the state court record, is as follows.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  On direct examination, the victim testified that she awakened in her bed at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986, when she \"heard the door squeak.\"  (Tr. 2-19).  She had the opportunity to \"look right at [the] face\" of her unknown assailant who had a knife in his hand.  (Tr. 2-19 &amp; 25).  The assailant climbed on top of her and, when she began to cry, told her \"to be quiet 'or I'll kill you.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  (Tr. 2-19).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The victim further testified that the assailant \"touched me on my breasts\" and inserted a finger in \"my vagina.\"  (Tr. 2-20).  The Boston Police Incident Report (\"the incident report\"), dated May 15, 1986, 10:25 a.m., fails to note a sexual assault.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  According to a subsequent police report filed by Detective Ingersoll, the victim first mentioned the above sexual assault at \"the probable cause hearing in Roxbury District Court.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  B;  Tr. 2-27).  The probable cause hearing apparently took place in August 1986, approximately 81 days after the incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the victim's testimony, the assailant, still armed with a knife, then pinned her to a wall while he looked through the house.  She was alone in the house at the time of the incident.  Although she did not see an accomplice, she testified that the assailant was not alone and that there were \"two of them.\"  (Tr. 2-22 &amp; 40).  After searching the house, the assailant left, taking with him a leather coat belonging to the victim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  (Tr. 2-21-22).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The victim then testified that she went to the home of her sister-in-law, who lived nearby,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and related her story.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  She telephoned the police who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and compiled the incident report.  (Tr. 2-22-24).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the afternoon of May 15, 1986, the victim went to the Boston Police Department, District 2, in Roxbury.  After viewing an array of 600 to 700 photographs, she identified petitioner as the assailant.  Detective Ingersoll conducted the photographic array.  Before viewing the photographs, the victim described the assailant as \"about five eleven, and he had dreadlocks, braided, with a hat.\"  (Tr. 2-26, 31, 33, 46 &amp; 49).  The incident report fails to mention the assailant as having a dreadlocks hairstyle.  Nor did trial counsel question the victim about this discrepancy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In identifying the assailant from the photographic array, trial counsel elicited from the victim that she could never forget the face of her assailant and, after viewing a photograph of petitioner for half a second, told the jury that \"I just knew right after I seen his picture.  I knew that that was him.\"  (Tr. 2-35;  see also, Tr. 2-42, 1. 13-15).  At several points during cross examination, trial counsel advised the victim to relax.  (Tr. 2-33 &amp; 39).  Trial counsel completed his cross examination without exploring her prior inconsistent statements or pointing out other discrepancies contained in her testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The prosecutor then rested the Commonwealth's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a bench conference immediately thereafter, trial counsel stated that petitioner was \"more than vociferous\" in urging trial counsel to recall the victim concerning discrepancies in her testimony.  Disagreeing with his client, trial counsel opted for a different \"strategy,\" explaining to the trial judge that it was \"a disadvantage when you try to cross examine young ladies because the fact that she's highly emotional.\"  (Tr. 2-62).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When petitioner took the stand, he denied ever being in the victim's house or bedroom on May 15, 1986.  (Tr. 2-71).  He testified that he regularly worked at Crossing Autobody Shop (\"the shop\") in Roxbury.  Petitioner further testified that from April through July 1986 he refurbished a 1980 Lincoln automobile at the shop with a friend, Christopher Cross.  Petitioner also testified that he regularly opened the shop every day at 7:30 a.m.  (Tr. 2-64-69 &amp; 84).  At the time of trial, however, he could not specifically recall where he was at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986.  (Tr. 2-66).  Trial counsel conducted a relatively brief direct examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's close friend, John Wornum, who presently resides in Georgia, was a \"part-owner\" of the shop in July of 1988.  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  H).  He was in Georgia at the time of trial and, according to his July 1988 affidavit, agreed to testify on petitioner's behalf.  Trial counsel failed to notify him of petitioner's trial.  He avers that, had he known of petitioner's trial, he would have testified that petitioner regularly worked at his shop in May of 1986 and that on \"a Thursday\" petitioner \"would have been working in ... the shop.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  H).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross examination of petitioner, the prosecutor pointed out that neither John Wornum, Rufus Wornum, who ran the shop in John Wornum's absence, nor Christopher Cross, were in the courtroom to verify petitioner's story of being at the shop at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986.  (Tr. 2-88).  Petitioner explained that John Wornum was in Georgia, Rufus Wornum was \"running the shop\" and Christopher Cross was in the marines.  (Tr. 2-88).  The prosecutor emphasized these \"missing witnesses\" in closing argument.  (Tr. 3-31).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After examination of petitioner, trial counsel rested his case.  (Tr. 2-92).  Trial counsel did not produce any character witnesses.  Nor did trial counsel move for a continuance at the outset of trial in order to secure the testimony of petitioner's alibi witness, John Wornum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel's closing argument focused on recapitulating the events of May 15, 1986, and the trial testimony.  As posited by trial counsel, the jury had to decide whether the victim was telling the truth.  (Tr. 3-7).  Rather than focusing on the victim's credibility or her identifications of petitioner, trial counsel cautioned the jury to consider Detective Ingersoll's conduct and the circumstances of petitioner's arrest 13 days after the photographic identification in the context of the phrase \"fair play.\"  (Tr. 3-8-12 &amp; 14-15).  He surmised that, had the arrest taken place immediately after the photographic identification, petitioner could have readily corroborated his whereabouts at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986.  Trial counsel then stated the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I suggest you could side with [the victim].

(Emphasis Added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel further argued that the victim was hysterical at the time she identified petitioner's photograph and essentially chose the first photograph she viewed of a male with a dreadlocks hairstyle.  At this point, the trial judge, upon objection, interrupted trial counsel's argument to advise the jury they were to consider only their recollection of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel then argued that petitioner was telling the truth because, in lieu of testifying that he knew he was at the garage on May 15, 1986, petitioner stated he \"usually\" worked at the garage.  He then committed what petitioner now argues were additional and rather grievous errors, i.e., he again sided with the victim and, referring to the photographic identification procedure, opined there was nothing wrong.  In fact, he reiterated, without qualification, the victim's positive identification of petitioner.  Trial counsel argued as follows:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the evidence that you heard was a fourteen year old girl.

He argued that petitioner was telling the truth and, despite the stigma of his dreadlocks hairstyle, continues to wear his hair in this style.

(Tr. 3-31).  He argued, without objection, that \"Brenda Barbosa came to this court to seek justice, and you can give her justice.  She is the victim.\"   Nor did trial counsel object to the prosecution's incorrect summary of the victim's initial description of petitioner to the police as a \"Black man, medium build, medium complexion, dreadlocks, the kind of hair that is customarily worn by people who come from Trinidad or Jamaica.

Nor did trial counsel request such an instruction (Tr. 3-49), although the trial judge anticipated he might give a Rodriguez instruction to the jury should they have a question (Tr. 3-52 &amp; 55).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  The trial judge did, however, caution the jury \"to consider whether the party had the opportunity to make the observation.\"  (Tr. 3-37).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) established a two prong standard in evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the Sixth Amendment.  First, petitioner must show that trial \" 'counsel's performance was deficient' and 'the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.' \"  Bryant v.

A deficient performance is one that falls below \"an objective standard of reasonableness\" under prevailing professional norms when considering all the circumstances.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064;  Clark v. Moran, 749 F.Supp. 1186, 1199 (D.R.I.1990), affm'd, 942 F.2d 24 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to emphasize that petitioner bears a \"heavy burden.\"  Whitman v. Ventetuolo, 781 F.Supp. 95, 99 (D.R.I.1991).  There is a presumption that trial \"counsel 'rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.' \"  Pilchak v. Camper, 741 F.Supp. 782, 792 (W.D.Mo.1990), affm'd, 935 F.2d 145 (8th Cir.1991) (quoting Strickland).

A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"  Id. at 1201;  accord Patterson v. Dahm, 769 F.Supp. 1103, 1107-1108 (D.Neb.1991).  Moreover, not \" 'every error that conceivably could have influenced the outcome undermines the reliability of the proceeding.' \"  Virella v.

Butler, 858 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1988).  Succinctly explained, \"the presumption of correctness accorded the factual determinations of the state court ... applies to the historical facts underlying the attorney's performance but not the ultimate conclusion as to whether or not effective assistance has been rendered.\"  Patterson v.

See generally, Perron v. Perrin, 742 F.2d 669, 672 (1st Cir.1984) (noting that ineffective assistance of counsel claim could be reconstructed from the record and that evidentiary hearing was therefore unnecessary;  nor, apparently, did parties request an evidentiary hearing).  Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution this court set an evidentiary hearing.

Trial Counsel's Failure to Impeach The Victim</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner claims that trial counsel failed to impeach the victim with her prior inconsistent statements and descriptions of the May 15, 1986, incident.  Specifically, trial counsel completely failed to question the victim about why she neglected to mention her assailant's dreadlocks hairstyle to the police when they first arrived at 273 Norfolk Avenue on the morning of May 15, 1986.  The incident report does not mention a dreadlocks hairstyle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing argument, trial counsel focused on the fact that petitioner had not altered his hairstyle since the May 15, 1986, incident despite the stigma attached to his hairstyle.  This argument misses the mark.  Petitioner's hairstyle is a particularly salient physical feature of his appearance.  Trial counsel never asked the victim why she failed to immediately mention this salient feature to the police when they arrived at at 273 Norfolk Avenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, trial counsel neglected to adequately question the victim about her delay in relating her story of a sexual assault to the police.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  The record reflects she did not mention the sexual assault to her sister-in-law or to Detective Williams before she viewed the photographic array.  Nor does the incident report describe a sexual assault.  Apparently, it was not until the probable cause hearing that the victim first mentioned the sexual assault.  Trial counsel's failure to adequately explore this lengthy lapse of time with the victim on cross examination presents a glaring omission which negatively impacts his entire performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does trial counsel's abbreviated and oblique reference to this lengthy delay in closing argument cure his error.  In closing argument, trial counsel stated that the victim did not tell anyone she had a \"physical disability\" on the day of the incident and he questioned whether the sexual assault ever \"really happened.\"  (Tr. 3-17, 1. 14-18;  Tr. 3-20, 1. 15-20).  Trial counsel did not, however, develop this argument for the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, trial counsel failed to question the victim about the variance in her statements regarding:  (1) whether the assailant took her leather coat;  and (2) her opportunity to view the assailant when he entered her room.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  The above errors collectively provide strong evidence of unreasonable and unprofessional judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent nevertheless correctly points out that ineffective trial strategy is not the equivalent of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  Patterson v. Dahm, 769 F.Supp. at 1110;  see also Rankin v. Roberts, 788 F.Supp. 521, 524 (D.Kan.1992) (counsel's failure to spend time with client, to cross examine witnesses and to make effective opening and closing arguments of appropriate length deemed matter of trial strategy).  It is also petitioner's burden to \"overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy.' \"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appeals Court stated that trial counsel's:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p>strategy, expressed at the bench (Tr. II 61-62), was reasonable in the circumstances.  He developed inconsistencies in the victim's story through cross examination of the victim (Tr. II 36-37) ... but chose not to undermine his defense strategy by suggesting that she had previously failed to mention the defendant's dreadlocks.  It also was a reasonable decision on his part not to appear to be badgering or harassing an already upset victim in front of the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  D).  As noted by petitioner (Docket Entry # 15, pp. 16-17), the cross examination cited above by the Appeals Court (Tr. 2-36-37, 1. 12-13) actually demonstrates that trial counsel failed to impeach the victim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Furthermore, if trial counsel's strategy was not to badger the victim in front of the jury, why then did trial counsel simply avoid a detailed cross examination of the victim and offer into evidence the incident report?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  Trial counsel's disregard of vital impeachment evidence in a case where the primary evidence consists of the victim's word against that of petitioner is both misguided and lacking in professional judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the historical facts demonstrates to this court that trial counsel's hesitancy to cross examine the victim was not based on trial strategy.  Rather, trial counsel's \"strategy\" in not cross examining the victim appears based on his personal discomfort in cross examining a female about a sexual assault.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  While understandable, a man's liberty was at stake and the victim's failure to mention the sexual assault until August of 1986 constituted a critical discrepancy in her story as did her failure to initially mention the dreadlocks hairstyle of the assailant to the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the prejudice component of the Strickland test, the victim's credibility was not a minor matter.  Both the accuracy and consistency of the victim's identifications of petitioner were significant matters, particularly in light of the limited number of witnesses and evidence presented.  See Nealy v. Cabana, 764 F.2d 1173, 1179 (5th Cir.1985).  Trial counsel himself characterized this as \"primarily an identity type of case.\"  (Tr. 2-61).  Nevertheless, trial counsel failed to call into question the victim's credibility by adequately exploring her delay in reporting the sexual assault;  her description of the assailant's dreadlocks hairstyle;  her description of being awake when the assailant entered her room;  and her assertion that the assailant took her leather coat.  Rather, trial counsel conducted an extremely limited cross examination of the victim which, despite the shortness in length, managed to elicit additional confirmatory statements regarding her identification of petitioner's photograph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Trial Counsel's Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner maintains that trial counsel's closing argument was inadequate and misdirected.  Despite petitioner's heavy burden, this court concurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset of his closing argument, trial counsel focused on whether petitioner received \"fair play\" because of the delay in his arrest and the circumstances surrounding his arrest.  (Tr. 3-8-12 &amp; 14-15).  This initial focus ignores the critical evidence concerning the victim's credibility and the strength of her identifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, trial counsel attempted to cloth the victim as an emotionally distraught girl who, in order to feel vindicated, chose the first photograph she viewed depicting an individual with a dreadlocks hairstyle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Not mentioning the victim's failure to initially describe the assailant as having a dreadlocks hairstyle arguably fits within this \"strategy,\" as noted by the Appeals Court.  What does not fit within this strategy, however, is trial counsel's failure to emphasize the victim's delay in reporting the sexual assault<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> and his failure to explore the victim's inconsistent descriptions concerning the leather coat and her opportunity to view the assailant.  Moreover, if the victim was emotionally distraught and hysterical, why did trial counsel simultaneously describe her as a forthright witness?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only was trial counsel's \"strategy\" misplaced but it ignored the strenuous urging of his client to identify the discrepancies contained in the victim's testimony (Tr. 2-61).  Consequently, although it is petitioner's burden to overcome the presumption that trial counsel's action might be sound trial strategy, United States v. Simone, 931 F.2d 1186, 1197 (7th Cir.), cert. den., 502 U.S. 981, 112 S.Ct. 584, 116 L.Ed.2d 609 (1991) (trial counsel's closing argument in following strategy did not fall below objective standard of reasonableness), when placed in the context of the entire closing argument, trial counsel's strategy was misguided, at best.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When discussing the victim, he suggested to the jury that they \"could side with [the victim]\" and that she was \"forthright.\"   These comments, viewed in the context of the particular quotation and of the entire argument, show a significant lack of professional judgment and reduced the effectiveness of trial counsel's \"strategy\" of depicting the victim as a highly emotional young woman who chose the first photograph she viewed containing a dreadlocks hairstyle.  In discussing the photographic identification, trial counsel reiterated the victim's positive and unequivocal identification of petitioner as the assailant as well as the correctness of the procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the above errors be viewed as innocent in their effect upon the jury.  Had trial counsel marshalled the victim's incompatible descriptions for the jury in his closing argument, there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Failure to Produce Alibi Witness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner claims that trial counsel failed to summons his only alibi witness or move for a continuance in order to secure the witness' attendance at trial.  Petitioner learned his case was set for trial on or about May 12, 1986, the day before trial commenced.  (Tr. 2-66).  He avers he informed trial counsel that John Wornum would testify on his behalf.  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  G).  John Wornum avers that he would have testified that petitioner regularly worked at his shop in May 1986 and that at 8:30 a.m. on a Thursday morning, petitioner \"would have been working in the yard or in the shop.\"  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  H).  John Wornum additionally avers that trial counsel never contacted him to testify despite his understanding that trial counsel would contact him at the appropriate time.  (Id.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appeals Court concluded, albeit not in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, that trial counsel's failure to call John Wornum as a witness would not have deprived petitioner of a substantial defense.  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  D).  This court respectfully disagrees with this conclusion.  The Appeals Court also noted that John Wornum's affidavit failed to state that he had a specific memory of May 15, 1986, or documentary evidence to support his contentions.  (Id.).  While this court accepts this factual finding regarding the content of the affidavit, the affidavit cannot be so easily discounted.  Rather, the affidavit provides strong evidence that John Wornum would have corroborated petitioner's defense that he was not at the scene of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of petitioner's principal defenses was that he was not in the victim's bedroom at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986.  He consistently claimed he was at work although he had no specific memory of his actions on May 15, 1986.  John Wornum's testimony was vital to this defense.  The prosecutor repeatedly noted his absence for the jury.  (Tr. 2-88 &amp; 3-31).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel's unexplained failure to contact John Wornum or to move for a continuance in order to secure his testimony was deficient and, under the circumstances, prejudicial.  Although presumably pressed for time because of the short trial notice, trial counsel could have moved for a continuance.  There is also no evidence that trial counsel made any attempt to contact John Wornum in advance or during petitioner's trial.  Such actions left the jury with little evidence to support petitioner's self serving testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p214\">\n      <span class=\"num\">214</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case decided before Strickland but nevertheless opposite to the case at bar, the court found that counsel was ineffective in failing to call an alibi witness when the entire case consisted of the personal identification of defendant by two victims of the armed robbery.  Wilson v. Cowan, 578 F.2d 166, 168 (6th Cir.1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  Although the jury had the benefit of petitioner's testimony, trial counsel's failure to call John Wornum to the witness stand nevertheless deprived the jury of a valuable opportunity to hear crucial evidence.  See Id. at 168.   This is particularly true in light of the limited nature of the evidence presented, including the lack of exhibits offered by trial counsel into the record and the lack of character witnesses to testify on petitioner's behalf and the jury's awareness of the absence of \"missing witnesses\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p215\">\n      <span class=\"num\">215</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Trial Preparation and Overall Performance</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner next argues that trial counsel's preparation and performance at trial fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  Under the circumstances, trial counsel had little time to prepare for trial.  This does not, however, excuse trial counsel's apparent failure to review the transcripts of the probable cause hearing or his failure throughout the direct examination of the victim to object to the prosecutor's leading questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the latter, failure to object at trial to leading questions is generally considered a tactical decision.  Pilchak v. Camper, 741 F.Supp. 782, 793 (W.D.Mo.1990).  In this case, the direct examination of the victim presents a series of leading questions without objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>  (Tr. 2-19-22).  Standing alone, this court might presume that trial counsel chose not to alienate the jury with repeated interruptions.  In the context of trial counsel's other errors, however, his failure to object is more troubling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner also complains that trial counsel failed to object to the prosecutor's mischaracterization of the evidence in closing argument.  Interruptions during closing argument are often avoided as a matter of professional courtesy, although the prosecutor showed no such professional courtesy.  This court, however, does not place particular emphasis on trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's misstatements of fact in closing argument inasmuch as the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury that it was their recollection of the evidence which was controlling.  (Tr. 3-9-10, 13-14 &amp; 36-37).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the failure to obtain transcripts of the probable cause hearing, this court is somewhat limited by the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  Although such a failure would evidence inadequate preparation, there is no showing of prejudice given the absence of adequate proof as to the testimony at the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, this court has given a great deal of thought and perpension to trial counsel's actions and inactions.  It is the culmination of errors taken as a whole which, under the circumstances, establishes trial counsel's ineffective assistance in this case.  In short, trial counsel failed to impeach the victim in a case where the jury obviously based its verdict on the victim's story.  Trial counsel failed to marshal the facts during a rather disjointed closing argument which focused in large part on the fairness of petitioner's arrest.  Finally, trial counsel failed to secure the testimony of petitioner's only alibi witness, John Wornum.  While counsel has no obligation to render a sterling performance, counsel does have an obligation to render a reasonable performance under prevailing professional norms.  Based on the foregoing reasons, this court finds that petitioner has shown that trial counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Prejudice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such ineffective assistance on the part of trial counsel was also highly prejudicial.  This case consisted primarily of the victim's testimony against that of petitioner.  Without producing petitioner's alibi witness nor any character witnesses, trial counsel left petitioner to present his own version of the facts to the jury without collateral support.  Nor did trial counsel fully attempt to discredit the victim's testimony with her prior inconsistent statements or her delay in reporting the sexual assault.  There is no indication in the trial record that trial counsel offered into evidence the incident report or the subsequent police report, so that the jury could compare the discrepancies between the victim's prior descriptions and her subsequent testimony in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p222\">\n      <span class=\"num\">222</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state the obvious, there were no witnesses to the May 15, 1986, incident other than the victim and the assailant.  Impeachment evidence therefore becomes all the more vital.  The jury is entitled to consider this evidence.  It is also entitled to consider the testimony of petitioner's only alibi witness.  The Sixth Amendment demands no less.  Had the jury considered this evidence, heard the testimony of John Wornum and heard an effective closing argument marshaling these discrepancies, there is a strong possibility that, but for trial counsel's errors in neglecting to present this evidence, the result of petitioner's trial would have been different.  These cumulative errors taken as a whole are sufficient to undermine this court's confidence in the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is therefore RECOMMENDED<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> that the writ of habeas corpus be ALLOWED unless respondent, on behalf of the Commonwealth, promptly elects to grant petitioner a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p>Stephen Hrones and Murray Kuhn for the petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p225\">\n      <span class=\"num\">225</span>\n      <p>Linda Nutting Murphy for the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Wornum explained in a post-trial affidavit that he is a long-time friend of Matthews's family and that Matthews would sometimes call him his \"uncle\" or \"father\" even though the two are not related</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Counsel for the respondent, an assistant attorney general for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, dropped the \"reasonable probability\" language from this standard and misleadingly suggested to us that Strickland requires the defendant to prove that \"but for\" counsel's inadequacies, the verdict would have been different.

Given the strength of her identification of him as her assailant, it was essential that counsel try to deflate this aspect of Barbosa's testimony.  Moreover, it is a misstatement to say that there was \"irrefutable evidence\" that Barbosa failed to report the rape for an eighty-one day period.  While the initial police record does not indicate that a rape was part of the physical attack, and Ingersoll's grand jury testimony was that his first knowledge of that part of the attack came as a result of the probable cause hearing, there is nothing in the record stating unequivocally that Barbosa had not told other authorities of the alleged rape prior to the probable cause hearing</p>\n        <p>Finally, we respond to our brother's assertion that we give \"too much credence to certain ageist and sexist assumptions--that it would be improper to question closely (and risk arousing the emotions of) a young female sexual assault victim....\"  First, our assessment of the reasonableness of D'Arcy's strategy would be no different had the victim been a fourteen-year-old boy.  Second, lawyers must devise their strategies in light of how real jurors might react--not necessarily politically correct ones.  The dissent suggests that a lawyer who considers the unfashionable assumptions and reactions of jurors in crafting a strategy deserves less deference than does a lawyer who ignores them or decides that the jury will rise above them.  We disagree.

After exhausting his remedies in the state courts, Matthews sought a writ of habeas corpus in the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254, claiming that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.  After referring the matter to a magistrate-judge for a report and recommendation, the district court granted the petition, and this appeal followed.  For the reasons discussed below, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>A. Pretrial Events</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 15, 1986, Brenda Barbosa, who was fourteen years old at the time, reported to Boston police that she had been attacked in her bedroom by a man with a knife earlier that morning.  Later that same day, after viewing several hundred photographs in police identification books, Barbosa identified Matthews, who wears his hair in a distinctive \"dreadlocks\" style and was so depicted in the photograph, as the man who had attacked her.  The police obtained an arrest warrant but, although they knew Matthews's address, made no immediate attempt to question him about the incident or take him into custody.  Matthews was eventually arrested on May 28, 1986, when a patrolling officer who had stopped to question Matthews on the street about unrelated conduct discovered the outstanding warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident report filed by the Boston police officer who first responded to Barbosa's call (the \"incident report\") contains no mention of a sexual assault.  The officer's account of his interview with Barbosa, conducted within two hours of the incident, is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>[T]he victim ... stated while she was sleeping the suspect entered the victim's bedroom and jumped on top of her.  The victim stated the suspect had a kitchen knife and told her, \"Be quiet, I don't want nothing from you, you won't get hurt.\"   The victim further stated the suspect then pulled the victim from her bed and ordered the victim to stand in a corner then the suspect ordered the victim to stand against a wall.  The victim then stated the suspect started looking through the rooms on all three floors.  The victim further stated the suspect then told the victim to close the door behind him when he left and not to tell anyone about him.  The victim stated she complied and the suspect fled on foot to a yellow m/v then fled in an unknown direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident report includes a description of the alleged assailant as a black male, 5'10\", black hair and brown eyes, wearing a black hat, brown leather jacket and black pants.  It does not indicate whether Barbosa mentioned to the officer that her attacker had dreadlocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matthews was initially charged with armed assault in a dwelling with intent to commit a felony, and with breaking and entering.  A probable cause hearing was conducted in Roxbury District Court on August 4, 1986.  There is no transcript of the hearing in the record.  Although the breaking and entering charge was dropped following the hearing, Matthews was bound over on the armed assault charge.  Subsequently, grand jury proceedings were initiated on that charge as well as two new charges apparently based on Barbosa's testimony at the probable cause hearing:  rape of a child with force, and indecent assault and battery on a person under 14.  At the grand jury proceeding, Boston Police Detective William Ingersoll--who oversaw the photo identification procedure in which Barbosa picked out Matthews--testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A. ... At the probable cause hearing in the Roxbury Court I was not present ... and I received a message following that hearing from the District Attorney who stated to me that during the probable cause hearing the victim--who was afraid to tell her mother and the police--that at the time during this breaking and entering and assault, the defendant did assault this young girl, again, 14 years of age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Q. In what manner?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>A. I believe it was placing the fingers to her vagina, more or less just the fingers.  She did not go to the hospital to be examined.  Again, she is a young Spanish girl and was ashamed even to tell the mother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no complaints at that time for rape in the Roxbury District Court against him.  I was unaware of this fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbosa also testified before the grand jury.  Certain aspects of her account of the May 15 events were not entirely consistent with the second-hand version contained in the incident report:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>A.  Well, I was sleeping and I heard the bedroom door, and when I looked up I seen this man and he jumped on top of me and put me against the wall....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Q.

The prosecution called two witnesses, Barbosa and Ingersoll, with Matthews as the only defense witness.  Because we must evaluate the alleged constitutional deficiencies of counsel's performance in light of his \"overall performance throughout the case,\" Strickland v.

Opening Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that immediately after Barbosa's attacker left her apartment, Barbosa ran next door \"and told her sister-in-law what had happened.\"   Despite strong evidence that Barbosa never told anyone that she had been sexually assaulted or raped until she testified at Matthews's probable cause hearing, 81 days after the incident, Matthews's trial counsel, Kenneth D'Arcy, did not challenge the prosecutor's assertions.  D'Arcy made clear from the outset that instead of challenging Barbosa's allegations, he would try to show that she had mistakenly picked Matthews out of the police photograph books because of his distinctive \"dreadlocks\" hairstyle.  D'Arcy told the jury that \"[t]here's no question in my mind and Mr. Matthews' mind that Brenda Barbosa was attacked in her bedroom on May 15th.  But you're going to hear from Mr. Matthews that on May 15th he was working in his father's garage.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Barbosa's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbosa, who had reached sixteen years of age by the time of the trial, testified on direct examination that she was asleep in her bed about 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986, when she was awakened by a man entering her room.  When she looked up, she saw the man had a knife.  The man got on top of her, put the knife to her throat and told her to be quiet or he would kill her.  The man touched Barbosa's breasts and put his finger inside Barbosa's vagina.  Then, the man pulled Barbosa off the bed and placed her against a wall, telling her to stay there while he walked through other rooms of the house.  Barbosa said he took her leather coat, although she did not say whether she saw him carry the coat away.  Barbosa identified Matthews as the man who attacked her.  The following exchange then ensued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>Q.

Yes, I did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbosa then testified as to how she picked Matthews's photograph out of the police books.  She said that she got a good look at her attacker's face;  that her attacker had long hair pinned up under a gray beret-like hat;  and that she had described the man to police as being about five-foot-eleven with dreadlocks and a hat.  Barbosa also testified that a few days after the attack, the same man came to her door and rang the doorbell.  She said that she \"went crazy, and ... started crying, and he just left.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his cross-examination, D'Arcy quickly began his attempt to show that Barbosa had immediately zeroed in on the fact that the assailant had dreadlocks:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Q.

Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Arcy then questioned Barbosa about her identification of Matthews as her attacker.  He elicited the not-too-helpful testimony that she had seen other people with dreadlocks before encountering Matthews, but that they did not look like him;  that she identified Matthews the same day as the alleged attack;  that she \"could never forget his face\";  and that she had picked the picture out after viewing it for just half a second.  Before he concluded this line of questioning, D'Arcy inartfully allowed Barbosa one more opportunity to tell the jury how certain she was of her identification of Matthews:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>Q. There's no question in your mind that this is the man that broke into your house and had a knife in his hand?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>A.

Well, did you tell him, you know, as you told the jury today, that the man grabbed your private parts?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>A. I only told him what he was asking me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p>Q. Is it fair to say, Brenda, that you really didn't tell Detective Ingersoll everything that happened when you were going over the pictures?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>A.

But you didn't tell him about the fact that this man touched your private parts?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>A. No, but I told the other cops when they came.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>Q. When?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>A. When it first happened, the cops that came over to the house.

You told them that he had grabbed you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>A. Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>Q. And touched your private parts, right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>A. Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these last four answers were apparently untrue, D'Arcy did not directly confront Barbosa with any prior statements or other evidence contradicting her testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Ingersoll's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingersoll testified that Barbosa and her sister-in-law, Carmen Barbosa, came to his office on the afternoon of May 15 to view photographs.  Ingersoll said he \"tried to determine what exactly had happened\" and then began showing Barbosa books containing photographs of black men of the approximate age that Barbosa had described.  Ingersoll testified that, in his estimation, Barbosa viewed \"about 600, 700 photographs.\"   When she turned to the photograph of Matthews, Ingersoll said, Barbosa \"became very excited.  'That's him.'   She got up from the table, jumping up and down.  'That's him, that's him.' \"   Ingersoll said that the picture of Matthews matched the general description contained in the original incident report, and that during her conversation with Ingersoll prior to viewing the photographs, Barbosa had mentioned that the attacker had dreadlocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, D'Arcy resumed his strategy of trying to show that Barbosa had picked out Matthews's picture because of his dreadlocks:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>Q. Now, when Brenda Barbosa came in the station, she gave you a description of the man that was in her home earlier, had dreadlocks;  do you remember?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>A. That's correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>Q. You don't have any books or just males with dreadlocks, though;  right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>A. No, sir.  The space just doesn't allow it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>Q. Did you look at any of the photos that she looked at, looking for men with dreadlocks?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p>A. Not at that particular time, no, sir.  I basically put a lot of the photographs in the books when we receive them for identification.  I don't make a special notice of dreadlocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p>Q. Do you know how many men had dreadlocks in the photos before Miss Barbosa picked Lloyd Matthews' picture?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p>A. I have no idea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>Q. It could have been any of them?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>A. It could have been any, could have been a few, could have been one.  I don't know.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>Q. Could have been one, right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p>A. The books are set up, Mr. D'Arcy, only by age, sex and race;  that's it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p>Q. So you're testifying today that Mr. Matthews could have been the first male that had dreadlocks in those photo books;  correct, Detective?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>A. Could have been.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon further questioning by D'Arcy, Ingersoll testified that he \"kn[e]w for a fact that there are many dreadlocks\" in the photograph books, and that he had \"had every confidence in the world that she would run into dreadlocks.\"   He also testified that he did not personally arrest Matthews, nor did he immediately have police officers go to Matthews's home to arrest him once an arrest warrant issued.  Instead, Ingersoll said, he told another police officer with duty in Matthews's neighborhood of the warrant, and that officer told Ingersoll \"that he would lock him up when he sees him.\"   Matthews was ultimately arrested when police stopped to question him on a Roxbury street on May 28, nine days after the warrant had issued and thirteen days after the crimes allegedly took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. The Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the prosecution rested, D'Arcy notified the court that Matthews was \"very upset\" with D'Arcy for not wanting to recall Barbosa to the stand to question her about discrepancies between her trial testimony and prior statements.  D'Arcy told the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>But in my perusal of the grand jury minutes, I mean--you know, this is an identity type of case, your Honor.  I know what the girl has been through.  It's obvious that a crime was committed.  My client's defense is that it's a misidentity.  She testified there was no question in her mind it was him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether she came downstairs with him or looked out the window, there's sort of minor discrepancies as far as I'm concerned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It's a disadvantage when you try to examine young ladies because of the fact that she's highly emotional.  I just feel--I disagree with my client.  I told him I didn't want to recall Brenda Barbosa.  You know, the bottom line is that I'm trying the case and he isn't.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But I just want the record to reflect that, you know, he's been more than vociferous that he doesn't agree with my strategy, shall we say.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Arcy then called Matthews to the stand.  Matthews testified that he had worked at his \"father\" John Wornum's<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> auto body shop in Roxbury on and off for years.  From April until July of 1986, Matthews testified, he and a friend, Chris Cross, were rebuilding a junked car that they eventually sold to a friend of Wornum.  Matthews could not say specifically that he was working at the shop on the morning of May 15, 1986, but he said that it was his usual practice to open up the shop each morning at 7:30 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Matthews explained that he was paid in cash and had no records or pay stubs proving that he worked at the body shop.  John Wornum, Matthews testified, had been in Georgia for several months;  Wornum's son, Rufus Wornum, was busy running the shop, and Chris Cross had agreed to testify on his behalf but had since joined the Marines.  Matthews also testified that he had no records pertaining to the rebuilt car, and that he did not know the person who bought it other than that he was a friend of John Wornum.  The prosecutor's final exchange with Matthews was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>Q. You're not specifically testifying as to where you were on the morning of May 15th, 1986;  are you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p>A. No, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike his opening, D'Arcy's summation contained at least some hints to the jury that perhaps Barbosa's story of what happened to her was not entirely truthful.  After incorrectly telling the jury that they had \"seen a girl fourteen years old,\" D'Arcy urged the jurors not to let their emotions affect their deliberations about</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p>what happened to this girl, if in fact it did happen....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have to decide did Brenda Barbosa really tell the truth of everything that happened.  Did she wake up and see a fellow there with a knife?   Was it somebody maybe she--she didn't go to school that day--that maybe a fellow that she was going to go to school with--maybe something got carried on that she didn't expect and she panicked, because she lived right--a relative lived right around the corner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Did it happen to her?   Did she tell Officer Ingersoll that she had been sexually assaulted?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Arcy did not, however, point to any evidence or prior statements suggesting that Barbosa was not truthful.  Instead, he discussed at length how a \"hysterical\" Barbosa had zeroed in on Matthews's photograph \"[a]s soon as she saw the dreadlocks,\" and how the failure of the police to arrest Matthews as soon as Barbosa had identified him was not \"fair play.\"   The near-two-week delay in Matthews's arrest left Matthews virtually no chance to prove that he was at the body shop while Barbosa allegedly was attacked, D'Arcy argued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Toward the end of his argument, D'Arcy again suggested that this was not just a case of mistaken identity, but also of truthfulness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Did you hear any hospital testimony regarding any physical disability with Brenda Barbosa?   Because I suggest she didn't tell anybody the day she picked out Mr. Matthews' picture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Did you hear any evidence of a lock being broken or of any damage to her house that allowed this stranger to come in?   No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">And again:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest that all of these gaps create some doubt, and that's the magic word, \"doubt\", beyond a reasonable doubt.  That's what you have to be convinced, that Lloyd Matthews was the individual that came into a room, and if in fact there was a breaking and entering, and indecently assaulted Brenda Barbosa, if in fact she was, and stuck his finger in her vagina, if in fact that was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because I suggest a fourteen year old that this has really happened to, when she went running out to her relation, she would have said, \"I've been violated,\" and she would have been brought right to the hospital for examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You know, fourteen years old, if this is what happened.  Then from the hospital the police would have got up there, and then maybe if she had told all the truth right away they would have picked up or investigated Lloyd Matthews that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had that occurred, D'Arcy argued, Matthews could have proved where he was the morning of May 15 and refuted the notion that he was the dreadlocked man who had attacked Barbosa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor recounted how certain Barbosa was of her identification and the substantial opportunity she had had to see him when he entered her room and was on top of her.  He told the jury to consider \"the sincerity of her emotions\" in testifying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keep that picture of her in your mind.  Those were not crocodile tears that came out of her eyes.

The trial court denied the motion.  The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the conviction, and the Supreme Judicial Court denied Matthews's petition to obtain further appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having exhausted his state remedies, Matthews filed his petition for habeas corpus in the district court on August 30, 1990.  Matthews argued that D'Arcy committed numerous errors that deprived him of effective assistance of counsel:  1) failure to impeach Brenda Barbosa with her prior inconsistent statements;  2) failure to make an effective closing argument;  3) failure to have Matthews's only alibi witness, John Wornum, appear and testify at trial;  and 4) failure to prepare adequately for trial and to object to improper leading questions and to the prosecutor's closing argument.  The respondent argued that D'Arcy's alleged \"errors\" were tactical or strategic choices made so as not to undermine D'Arcy's strategy of pursuing the \"dreadlocks\" defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An evidentiary hearing was convened on January 15, 1993, but neither party chose to present evidence beyond that already contained in the record.  On March 17, 1993, a United States Magistrate Judge agreed with virtually all of Matthews's assertions and, finding that \"the culmination of errors taken as a whole ... establishes trial counsel's ineffective assistance in this case,\" recommended that the writ be allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the magistrate-judge's recommended result but not her reasoning.  The court found that D'Arcy had adopted a professionally responsible strategy by not contesting that Barbosa was sexually assaulted by a black man with dreadlocks and by seeking instead to suggest that, in her subsequent hysteria, she mistakenly selected Matthews's photograph because his was the first picture of a man with dreadlocks.  The court held that because D'Arcy relied on the mistaken-identity defense, however, his failure to investigate Matthews's only alibi witness, John Wornum, or to seek a continuance in order to do so, was not ascribable to any strategic reason and therefore constituted constitutionally deficient assistance of counsel that prejudiced Matthews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent appealed, arguing that Wornum's affidavit contained no indication that his testimony would provide an alibi for Matthews.  Matthews filed two briefs pro se, one as appellee urging that we affirm the district court's order, and another as appellant asking that we grant the petition on the grounds recommended by the magistrate-judge but rejected by the district court.II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

D'Arcy's Performance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matthews concedes that the central issue in the case was the identity of the attacker.  What he challenges is D'Arcy's decision to use the \"dreadlocks\" defense to attempt to persuade the jury that Barbosa had misidentified Matthews, rather than focusing on the apparent inconsistencies of her prior statements and her failure to report the alleged rape immediately.  D'Arcy's decision to employ the dreadlocks strategy was not a professionally reasonable choice, Matthews claims, because D'Arcy possessed no evidence that Barbosa had picked Matthews's photograph out because of his hairstyle.  D'Arcy had no knowledge of how many pictures of men with dreadlocks Barbosa had seen before identifying Matthews, and the police report contains no indication that Barbosa had mentioned dreadlocks in her initial description of the attacker, thus undermining the argument that the hairstyle was the predominant feature.  Therefore, Matthews argues, instead of concealing the fact that Barbosa did not mention dreadlocks initially, D'Arcy should have driven this point home to the jury and called into question Barbosa's powers of observation.  Furthermore, Matthews maintains, D'Arcy should have questioned Barbosa about the discrepancy between the police report's version of when she initially saw her attacker, and her own testimony--i.e., whether she was awakened by a man entering her bedroom and jumping on top of her, or whether she heard the door, and thus had a longer time to view her attacker--and he should have called into question Barbosa's truthfulness generally by impeaching her regarding her delay in reporting the alleged rape.  Finally, Matthews argues, D'Arcy should have marshalled an effective closing argument underscoring the inconsistencies in Barbosa's prior statements, rather than delivering a disjointed speech that, Matthews claims, bordered on an invitation to convict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree that D'Arcy's strategic choice to employ the \"dreadlocks defense\" was professionally unreasonable.  That it was not ultimately a winning strategy is of no moment in assessing its reasonableness at the time, see United States v. Natanel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 310 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span> </span>(1992).  D'Arcy had little to work with, given the persuasive power of Barbosa's identification testimony and the inherent weakness of Matthews's alibi, and he chose what he thought was a reasonable line of argument that carried with it little risk of alienating the jury.  A strategic choice that would have included more direct attacks on Barbosa's credibility and, inevitably, her character, would have carried with it a far greater risk of offending the jury.  Thus, we hold that, in choosing to emphasize Matthews's dreadlocks as the reason that Barbosa identified him as her attacker, rather than highlighting alleged inconsistencies in Barbosa's trial testimony and her prior statements, D'Arcy employed a professionally reasonable strategy and did not, by virtue of that choice alone, deprive Matthews of effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matthews also argues, however, that D'Arcy did in fact challenge Barbosa's credibility--by questioning her about her apparent failure to report immediately that she was raped, and by arguing this point to the jury--and that therefore D'Arcy's failure to impeach Barbosa more directly, or at least to introduce the impeaching evidence through another witness, cannot be deemed a strategic choice.  We agree that the record makes clear that D'Arcy did attempt to elicit from Barbosa an admission that she did not immediately report the rape.  Indeed, D'Arcy successfully forced Barbosa to change her testimony and admit that she had not, in fact, told Detective Ingersoll about the rape.  The question we must address, however, is whether, once Barbosa went on to testify that she had told the police who had initially responded to her call that she was raped, and that \"it's right in the report,\" D'Arcy's failure to demonstrate to the jury that these statements were apparently untrue constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.  Put another way, the issue is whether it may be considered acceptable trial strategy to have questioned Barbosa about her delay in reporting the rape without impeaching her when the answers she gave were not favorable to Matthews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bearing in mind that the defendant must overcome \"a strong presumption\" that D'Arcy's conduct \"falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">689,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">2065</span></a></span>, we are unable to come to any conclusion other than that Matthews has not done so here.  To be sure, there were points to be scored against Barbosa's credibility after she insisted that she had in fact immediately told police that she had been raped.  D'Arcy could have confronted her with the incident report containing no mention of a rape, or he could have asked her about her testimony at the probable cause hearing.  He also could have questioned Ingersoll about when he first learned that Barbosa claimed to have been raped.  But, as D'Arcy made clear to the trial judge at a sidebar conference following the close of the prosecution's case, Matthews's primary defense remained that Barbosa had picked out the wrong assailant, and not that she had not been attacked at all.  While Barbosa's delay in reporting that she was raped might have affected the jury's assessment of her overall credibility as a witness, we think this would be much more likely if the primary issue had been consent.  Here, the primary issue, and the heart of the defense's theory, was not whether a crime occurred but rather who committed it.  Moreover, the record makes apparent that Barbosa was quite obviously upset on the witness stand as she retold her experience;  this circumstance, along with Barbosa's youth (rendering her failure to report a rape immediately all the more explicable), diminishes the likelihood that the jury would doubt that such an attack occurred simply because Barbosa delayed in reporting it.  D'Arcy had to balance the limited evidentiary value of Barbosa's delay against the danger of the jury misperceiving an impeachment attempt as badgering or callously tarnishing Barbosa.  Another lawyer might have struck a different balance, but we do not find that D'Arcy's on-the-spot decision to let Barbosa's answer stand and argue the inference he had raised to the jury was \"beyond the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other alleged inconsistencies in Barbosa's statements that Matthews claims D'Arcy should have raised are trivial, and thus D'Arcy's decision not to question Barbosa about them was a sound tactical choice.  That the incident report, prepared immediately after the attack, contains no mention of dreadlocks, is inconsequential in light of the fact that Barbosa told Ingersoll before viewing any photographs that her attacker had dreadlocks.  Furthermore, to point out this \"inconsistency\" would have only weakened D'Arcy's argument that it was the dreadlocks that had in fact caused Barbosa to pick Matthews's picture out of the photograph books.  As for the \"inconsistency\" between when Barbosa initially told police she was awakened and her testimony in court, we note that the incident report's statement that \"while [Barbosa] was sleeping the suspect entered the victim's bedroom and jumped on top of her\" is a hearsay account of what Barbosa said immediately after the attack, and, even if true, would only have deprived her of a few seconds of the time she claimed to have viewed her attacker.  She still was able to view him while he was on top of her;  at various times while he searched the apartment;  and when he returned to Barbosa's home on the weekend.  Thus, D'Arcy's decision to eschew questioning on these matters was a sound trial tactic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address the grounds on which the district court actually granted the writ:  D'Arcy's failure to call John Wornum, or to request a continuance so that he could do so.  Here, we disagree with the district court's conclusion;  we cannot see how Matthews was prejudiced.  Wornum's testimony would have corroborated Matthews's testimony in general--i.e., that there actually was a Crossing Auto Body Shop, and that Matthews actually worked there, and perhaps even that he generally opened the shop early in the morning--which would have taken some of the wind out of the sails of the prosecutor's closing argument, in which he cast doubt on the entirety of Matthews's testimony.  Wornum's affidavit makes clear, however, that he could not provide an alibi for Matthews on the particular day of the crime.  Matthews argues that Wornum's testimony is all the more credible because he does not pretend to be able to say for sure where Matthews was on a particular morning several years ago.  That may be true, but it is far less probative of Matthews's innocence.  Moreover, a jury might have drawn a negative inference from the things that Wornum's affidavit does not indicate he is willing to testify to:  namely, the identity of the purchaser of the car Matthews says he was rebuilding around the time of the crime, or any other information regarding the car's purchase and sale.  Thus, while Wornum's testimony might have been, on balance, of marginal utility to Matthews, his affidavit does not create in us any belief that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different had he testified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Matthews was not deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, and the decision of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with the majority that D'Arcy's failure to call John Wornum, when examined in isolation, did not violate the Sixth Amendment.

I therefore dissent from the majority opinion.  In explaining my dissent, I shall limit myself to three points not made in the extremely thorough and well-reasoned report and recommendation of Magistrate Judge Bowler, the relevant portion of which I attach as an appendix to my dissent.  See Matthews v. Rakiey, Civil Action No. 90-12111-WF (D.Mass. filed March 17, 1993).  Magistrate Judge Bowler's opinion combines an accurate exposition of the facts with a correct statement of the applicable legal principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion makes clear that D'Arcy declined to submit irrefutable evidence, readily available to him, that Barbosa waited eighty-one days to report the rape and that Barbosa testified untruthfully as to when she first informed the police and her sister-in-law that she had been raped.  In considering whether D'Arcy's inaction was substandard under Strickland 's first prong, the majority employs a false assumption.  The majority excuses D'Arcy's tactics in part by pointing out that he pursued a misidentification defense (the \"dreadlocks defense\") and did not really challenge Barbosa's rape allegation.  See ante at 917 (\"Matthew's primary defense remained that Barbosa had picked out the wrong assailant, and not that she had not been attacked at all.  While Barbosa's delay in reporting that she was raped might have affected the jury's assessment of her overall credibility as a witness, we think this would be much more likely if the primary issue had been consent.  Here, the primary issue, and the heart of the defense's theory, was not whether a crime occurred but rather who committed it.\").  It then concludes that, in the context of the misidentification/dreadlocks defense, D'Arcy's failure to expose the glaring inconsistencies in Barbosa's testimony and prior statements was not \"beyond the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 917-18.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, this line of reasoning tacitly assumes the soundness of D'Arcy's decision not to question whether Barbosa had in fact been raped.  Such an assumption is not warranted in this case for the following reasons.  First, the two defenses would not have been inconsistent.  There would have been nothing inherently suspect about arguing that Barbosa had identified the wrong man and that she had not been, or may not have been, raped.  Second, there was significant evidence tending to undermine Barbosa's account of the sexual assault.  Had the jury been fully apprised of the irregularities surrounding the reporting of the rape charge, it may well have concluded that it could not convict Matthews of rape beyond a reasonable doubt.  Third, D'Arcy did argue to the jury, albeit as an afterthought, that Barbosa may not have been raped.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 914 </a></span>(excerpting portions of closing argument where D'Arcy asks the jury to consider whether a rape took place).  In view of this last fact alone, I am puzzled by the majority's conclusion that D'Arcy's refusal to buttress his argument with significant supporting evidence constituted \"sound trial tactics.\"   D'Arcy ultimately thought the \"rape may not have happened\" theory worth arguing;  how then could it not have been worth supporting with evidence that was available?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not think that the existence of one reasonable defense strategy, without more, establishes constitutionally effective representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also disagree with the majority's conclusion that, within the confines of the misidentification/dreadlock defense, D'Arcy's failure to impeach Barbosa passed constitutional muster.  The case hinged on Barbosa's credibility as a witness, and I simply do not see how it could have been \"sound\" for D'Arcy to fail to demonstrate to the jury that Barbosa had testified untruthfully on several very important matters (including when she first informed the police and her sister-in-law that she had been raped).  He certainly could have done so sensitively and without suggesting improper motive on Barbosa's part.  The omitted impeachment evidence could have been easily introduced as further confirmation of that which D'Arcy had already suggested to the jury:  the trauma of awakening to find an intruder in the room quite reasonably rendered suspect Barbosa's powers of perception and recall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to a second point.  The majority, in my opinion, gives too much credence to certain ageist and sexist assumptions--that it would be improper to question closely (and risk arousing the emotions of) a young female sexual assault victim, and that the jury cannot rise above its sympathy for young female sexual assault victims and do its assigned job--that heavily informed D'Arcy's performance and decision-making.  Along these lines, I note the majority's conclusion that Barbosa's age \"render[s] her failure to report the rape immediately all the more explicable.\"   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 917. </a></span> The explicability vel non of Barbosa's failure to report the rape immediately--as well as Barbosa's failure to testify truthfully about when she first reported the rape--had vital bearing on Barbosa's credibility.  It should have been left to the jury's consideration after argument by counsel.  In my opinion, a reviewing court has no business explaining this failure away, without citation to supporting authority, as an understandable by-product of youth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While counsel must tread carefully in questioning the alleged victim in cases such as this, counsel cannot abdicate the constitutional responsibilities of a defense attorney.  The record amply demonstrates that D'Arcy was more concerned with the young victim's emotional state than providing his client with a vigorous defense, and that his hands-off approach to the case led to a constitutionally-defective performance.  The sentiments that prompted D'Arcy's ineffectiveness may be understandable.  They cannot, however, be tolerated in our criminal justice system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion does not discuss D'Arcy's failure to object to the prosecutor's closing argument, and Magistrate Judge Bowler evaluates this failure only insofar as the argument mischaracterized the evidence.  I think it important to note that the closing contained both an improper appeal to the jury to act other than as a dispassionate arbiter of the facts and an improper and inflammatory appeal to the jury's emotions.  Neither type of argument is permissible.  See, e.g., United States v. Manning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/195356/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 573 (1st Cir.1994) (prosecutor may not ask jury to act other than as a dispassionate arbiter of the facts);  Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628961\"><a href=\"/opinion/628961/juan-arrieta-agressot-regulo-rios-jose-antonio-barroso-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 527 (1st Cir.1993) (prosecutor may not inflame the prejudices and passions of the jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the prosecutor told the jury:  \"Keep that picture of [Barbosa] in your mind.  Those were not crocodile tears that came out of her eyes.  Those were genuine tears based on honesty and certainty.  Brenda Barbosa came to this court to seek justice, and you can give her justice.  She is the victim.\"   See ante at 915.  Perhaps because the concept of \"tears of certainty\" is new to me, I regard the first three sentences of the quotation as an ill-concealed and inflammatory entreaty for jury sympathy.  And the last two sentences of the quotation are at worst an appeal for vengeance and at best a request that the jury do something other than dispassionately judge the facts for itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case as close as this one, these improper arguments could have made a real difference.  D'Arcy's failure to object to them was another error in the long line of trial mistakes that show his incompetency beyond cavil.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <p>United States District Court</p>\n    <p>District of Massachusetts</p>\n    <p>LLOYD MATTHEWS, Petitioner,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p>v.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p>PAUL RAKIEY, Superintendent at M.C.I.-Walpole, Respondent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p>Civil Action No. 90-12111-WF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p>REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION RE: PETITIONER'S WRIT OF HABEAS</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CORPUS (DOCKET ENTRY # 23)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p>March 17, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWLER, United States Magistrate Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony at trial, taken from the state court record, is as follows.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  On direct examination, the victim testified that she awakened in her bed at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986, when she \"heard the door squeak.\"  (Tr. 2-19).  She had the opportunity to \"look right at [the] face\" of her unknown assailant who had a knife in his hand.  (Tr. 2-19 &amp; 25).  The assailant climbed on top of her and, when she began to cry, told her \"to be quiet 'or I'll kill you.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  (Tr. 2-19).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The victim further testified that the assailant \"touched me on my breasts\" and inserted a finger in \"my vagina.\"  (Tr. 2-20).  The Boston Police Incident Report (\"the incident report\"), dated May 15, 1986, 10:25 a.m., fails to note a sexual assault.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  According to a subsequent police report filed by Detective Ingersoll, the victim first mentioned the above sexual assault at \"the probable cause hearing in Roxbury District Court.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  B;  Tr. 2-27).  The probable cause hearing apparently took place in August 1986, approximately 81 days after the incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the victim's testimony, the assailant, still armed with a knife, then pinned her to a wall while he looked through the house.  She was alone in the house at the time of the incident.  Although she did not see an accomplice, she testified that the assailant was not alone and that there were \"two of them.\"  (Tr. 2-22 &amp; 40).  After searching the house, the assailant left, taking with him a leather coat belonging to the victim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  (Tr. 2-21-22).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The victim then testified that she went to the home of her sister-in-law, who lived nearby,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and related her story.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  She telephoned the police who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and compiled the incident report.  (Tr. 2-22-24).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the afternoon of May 15, 1986, the victim went to the Boston Police Department, District 2, in Roxbury.  After viewing an array of 600 to 700 photographs, she identified petitioner as the assailant.  Detective Ingersoll conducted the photographic array.  Before viewing the photographs, the victim described the assailant as \"about five eleven, and he had dreadlocks, braided, with a hat.\"  (Tr. 2-26, 31, 33, 46 &amp; 49).  The incident report fails to mention the assailant as having a dreadlocks hairstyle.  Nor did trial counsel question the victim about this discrepancy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In identifying the assailant from the photographic array, trial counsel elicited from the victim that she could never forget the face of her assailant and, after viewing a photograph of petitioner for half a second, told the jury that \"I just knew right after I seen his picture.  I knew that that was him.\"  (Tr. 2-35;  see also, Tr. 2-42, 1. 13-15).  At several points during cross examination, trial counsel advised the victim to relax.  (Tr. 2-33 &amp; 39).  Trial counsel completed his cross examination without exploring her prior inconsistent statements or pointing out other discrepancies contained in her testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The prosecutor then rested the Commonwealth's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a bench conference immediately thereafter, trial counsel stated that petitioner was \"more than vociferous\" in urging trial counsel to recall the victim concerning discrepancies in her testimony.  Disagreeing with his client, trial counsel opted for a different \"strategy,\" explaining to the trial judge that it was \"a disadvantage when you try to cross examine young ladies because the fact that she's highly emotional.\"  (Tr. 2-62).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When petitioner took the stand, he denied ever being in the victim's house or bedroom on May 15, 1986.  (Tr. 2-71).  He testified that he regularly worked at Crossing Autobody Shop (\"the shop\") in Roxbury.  Petitioner further testified that from April through July 1986 he refurbished a 1980 Lincoln automobile at the shop with a friend, Christopher Cross.  Petitioner also testified that he regularly opened the shop every day at 7:30 a.m.  (Tr. 2-64-69 &amp; 84).  At the time of trial, however, he could not specifically recall where he was at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986.  (Tr. 2-66).  Trial counsel conducted a relatively brief direct examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's close friend, John Wornum, who presently resides in Georgia, was a \"part-owner\" of the shop in July of 1988.  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  H).  He was in Georgia at the time of trial and, according to his July 1988 affidavit, agreed to testify on petitioner's behalf.  Trial counsel failed to notify him of petitioner's trial.  He avers that, had he known of petitioner's trial, he would have testified that petitioner regularly worked at his shop in May of 1986 and that on \"a Thursday\" petitioner \"would have been working in ... the shop.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  H).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross examination of petitioner, the prosecutor pointed out that neither John Wornum, Rufus Wornum, who ran the shop in John Wornum's absence, nor Christopher Cross, were in the courtroom to verify petitioner's story of being at the shop at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986.  (Tr. 2-88).  Petitioner explained that John Wornum was in Georgia, Rufus Wornum was \"running the shop\" and Christopher Cross was in the marines.  (Tr. 2-88).  The prosecutor emphasized these \"missing witnesses\" in closing argument.  (Tr. 3-31).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After examination of petitioner, trial counsel rested his case.  (Tr. 2-92).  Trial counsel did not produce any character witnesses.  Nor did trial counsel move for a continuance at the outset of trial in order to secure the testimony of petitioner's alibi witness, John Wornum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel's closing argument focused on recapitulating the events of May 15, 1986, and the trial testimony.  As posited by trial counsel, the jury had to decide whether the victim was telling the truth.  (Tr. 3-7).  Rather than focusing on the victim's credibility or her identifications of petitioner, trial counsel cautioned the jury to consider Detective Ingersoll's conduct and the circumstances of petitioner's arrest 13 days after the photographic identification in the context of the phrase \"fair play.\"  (Tr. 3-8-12 &amp; 14-15).  He surmised that, had the arrest taken place immediately after the photographic identification, petitioner could have readily corroborated his whereabouts at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986.  Trial counsel then stated the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I suggest you could side with [the victim].

(Emphasis Added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel further argued that the victim was hysterical at the time she identified petitioner's photograph and essentially chose the first photograph she viewed of a male with a dreadlocks hairstyle.  At this point, the trial judge, upon objection, interrupted trial counsel's argument to advise the jury they were to consider only their recollection of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel then argued that petitioner was telling the truth because, in lieu of testifying that he knew he was at the garage on May 15, 1986, petitioner stated he \"usually\" worked at the garage.  He then committed what petitioner now argues were additional and rather grievous errors, i.e., he again sided with the victim and, referring to the photographic identification procedure, opined there was nothing wrong.  In fact, he reiterated, without qualification, the victim's positive identification of petitioner.  Trial counsel argued as follows:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the evidence that you heard was a fourteen year old girl.

He argued that petitioner was telling the truth and, despite the stigma of his dreadlocks hairstyle, continues to wear his hair in this style.

She is the victim.\"   Nor did trial counsel object to the prosecution's incorrect summary of the victim's initial description of petitioner to the police as a \"Black man, medium build, medium complexion, dreadlocks, the kind of hair that is customarily worn by people who come from Trinidad or Jamaica.

Specifically, trial counsel completely failed to question the victim about why she neglected to mention her assailant's dreadlocks hairstyle to the police when they first arrived at 273 Norfolk Avenue on the morning of May 15, 1986.  The incident report does not mention a dreadlocks hairstyle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing argument, trial counsel focused on the fact that petitioner had not altered his hairstyle since the May 15, 1986, incident despite the stigma attached to his hairstyle.  This argument misses the mark.  Petitioner's hairstyle is a particularly salient physical feature of his appearance.  Trial counsel never asked the victim why she failed to immediately mention this salient feature to the police when they arrived at at 273 Norfolk Avenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, trial counsel neglected to adequately question the victim about her delay in relating her story of a sexual assault to the police.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  The record reflects she did not mention the sexual assault to her sister-in-law or to Detective Williams before she viewed the photographic array.  Nor does the incident report describe a sexual assault.  Apparently, it was not until the probable cause hearing that the victim first mentioned the sexual assault.  Trial counsel's failure to adequately explore this lengthy lapse of time with the victim on cross examination presents a glaring omission which negatively impacts his entire performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does trial counsel's abbreviated and oblique reference to this lengthy delay in closing argument cure his error.  In closing argument, trial counsel stated that the victim did not tell anyone she had a \"physical disability\" on the day of the incident and he questioned whether the sexual assault ever \"really happened.\"  (Tr. 3-17, 1. 14-18;  Tr. 3-20, 1. 15-20).

It also was a reasonable decision on his part not to appear to be badgering or harassing an already upset victim in front of the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  D).  As noted by petitioner (Docket Entry # 15, pp. 16-17), the cross examination cited above by the Appeals Court (Tr. 2-36-37, 1. 12-13) actually demonstrates that trial counsel failed to impeach the victim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Furthermore, if trial counsel's strategy was not to badger the victim in front of the jury, why then did trial counsel simply avoid a detailed cross examination of the victim and offer into evidence the incident report?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  Trial counsel's disregard of vital impeachment evidence in a case where the primary evidence consists of the victim's word against that of petitioner is both misguided and lacking in professional judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the historical facts demonstrates to this court that trial counsel's hesitancy to cross examine the victim was not based on trial strategy.  Rather, trial counsel's \"strategy\" in not cross examining the victim appears based on his personal discomfort in cross examining a female about a sexual assault.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  While understandable, a man's liberty was at stake and the victim's failure to mention the sexual assault until August of 1986 constituted a critical discrepancy in her story as did her failure to initially mention the dreadlocks hairstyle of the assailant to the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the prejudice component of the Strickland test, the victim's credibility was not a minor matter.  Both the accuracy and consistency of the victim's identifications of petitioner were significant matters, particularly in light of the limited number of witnesses and evidence presented.  See Nealy v. Cabana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453531\"><a href=\"/opinion/453531/james-nealy-v-donald-a-cabana-superintendent-of-mississippi-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span>, 1179 (5th Cir.1985).  Trial counsel himself characterized this as \"primarily an identity type of case.\"  (Tr. 2-61).  Nevertheless, trial counsel failed to call into question the victim's credibility by adequately exploring her delay in reporting the sexual assault;  her description of the assailant's dreadlocks hairstyle;  her description of being awake when the assailant entered her room;  and her assertion that the assailant took her leather coat.  Rather, trial counsel conducted an extremely limited cross examination of the victim which, despite the shortness in length, managed to elicit additional confirmatory statements regarding her identification of petitioner's photograph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Trial Counsel's Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner maintains that trial counsel's closing argument was inadequate and misdirected.  Despite petitioner's heavy burden, this court concurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset of his closing argument, trial counsel focused on whether petitioner received \"fair play\" because of the delay in his arrest and the circumstances surrounding his arrest.  (Tr. 3-8-12 &amp; 14-15).  This initial focus ignores the critical evidence concerning the victim's credibility and the strength of her identifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, trial counsel attempted to cloth the victim as an emotionally distraught girl who, in order to feel vindicated, chose the first photograph she viewed depicting an individual with a dreadlocks hairstyle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Not mentioning the victim's failure to initially describe the assailant as having a dreadlocks hairstyle arguably fits within this \"strategy,\" as noted by the Appeals Court.  What does not fit within this strategy, however, is trial counsel's failure to emphasize the victim's delay in reporting the sexual assault<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> and his failure to explore the victim's inconsistent descriptions concerning the leather coat and her opportunity to view the assailant.  Moreover, if the victim was emotionally distraught and hysterical, why did trial counsel simultaneously describe her as a forthright witness?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only was trial counsel's \"strategy\" misplaced but it ignored the strenuous urging of his client to identify the discrepancies contained in the victim's testimony (Tr. 2-61).  Consequently, although it is petitioner's burden to overcome the presumption that trial counsel's action might be sound trial strategy, United States v.

In discussing the photographic identification, trial counsel reiterated the victim's positive and unequivocal identification of petitioner as the assailant as well as the correctness of the procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the above errors be viewed as innocent in their effect upon the jury.

Failure to Produce Alibi Witness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner claims that trial counsel failed to summons his only alibi witness or move for a continuance in order to secure the witness' attendance at trial.  Petitioner learned his case was set for trial on or about May 12, 1986, the day before trial commenced.  (Tr. 2-66).  He avers he informed trial counsel that John Wornum would testify on his behalf.  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  G).  John Wornum avers that he would have testified that petitioner regularly worked at his shop in May 1986 and that at 8:30 a.m. on a Thursday morning, petitioner \"would have been working in the yard or in the shop.\"  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  H).  John Wornum additionally avers that trial counsel never contacted him to testify despite his understanding that trial counsel would contact him at the appropriate time.  (Id.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appeals Court concluded, albeit not in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, that trial counsel's failure to call John Wornum as a witness would not have deprived petitioner of a substantial defense.  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  D).  This court respectfully disagrees with this conclusion.  The Appeals Court also noted that John Wornum's affidavit failed to state that he had a specific memory of May 15, 1986, or documentary evidence to support his contentions.  (Id.).  While this court accepts this factual finding regarding the content of the affidavit, the affidavit cannot be so easily discounted.  Rather, the affidavit provides strong evidence that John Wornum would have corroborated petitioner's defense that he was not at the scene of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of petitioner's principal defenses was that he was not in the victim's bedroom at 8:30 a.m. on May 15, 1986.  He consistently claimed he was at work although he had no specific memory of his actions on May 15, 1986.  John Wornum's testimony was vital to this defense.  The prosecutor repeatedly noted his absence for the jury.  (Tr. 2-88 &amp; 3-31).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel's unexplained failure to contact John Wornum or to move for a continuance in order to secure his testimony was deficient and, under the circumstances, prejudicial.  Although presumably pressed for time because of the short trial notice, trial counsel could have moved for a continuance.  There is also no evidence that trial counsel made any attempt to contact John Wornum in advance or during petitioner's trial.  Such actions left the jury with little evidence to support petitioner's self serving testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p214\">\n      <span class=\"num\">214</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case decided before Strickland but nevertheless opposite to the case at bar, the court found that counsel was ineffective in failing to call an alibi witness when the entire case consisted of the personal identification of defendant by two victims of the armed robbery.  Wilson v.

Trial Preparation and Overall Performance</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner next argues that trial counsel's preparation and performance at trial fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  Under the circumstances, trial counsel had little time to prepare for trial.  This does not, however, excuse trial counsel's apparent failure to review the transcripts of the probable cause hearing or his failure throughout the direct examination of the victim to object to the prosecutor's leading questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the latter, failure to object at trial to leading questions is generally considered a tactical decision.  Pilchak v. Camper, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></span>, 793 (W.D.Mo.1990).  In this case, the direct examination of the victim presents a series of leading questions without objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>  (Tr. 2-19-22).  Standing alone, this court might presume that trial counsel chose not to alienate the jury with repeated interruptions.  In the context of trial counsel's other errors, however, his failure to object is more troubling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner also complains that trial counsel failed to object to the prosecutor's mischaracterization of the evidence in closing argument.  Interruptions during closing argument are often avoided as a matter of professional courtesy, although the prosecutor showed no such professional courtesy.  This court, however, does not place particular emphasis on trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's misstatements of fact in closing argument inasmuch as the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury that it was their recollection of the evidence which was controlling.  (Tr. 3-9-10, 13-14 &amp; 36-37).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the failure to obtain transcripts of the probable cause hearing, this court is somewhat limited by the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  Although such a failure would evidence inadequate preparation, there is no showing of prejudice given the absence of adequate proof as to the testimony at the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, this court has given a great deal of thought and perpension to trial counsel's actions and inactions.  It is the culmination of errors taken as a whole which, under the circumstances, establishes trial counsel's ineffective assistance in this case.  In short, trial counsel failed to impeach the victim in a case where the jury obviously based its verdict on the victim's story.  Trial counsel failed to marshal the facts during a rather disjointed closing argument which focused in large part on the fairness of petitioner's arrest.  Finally, trial counsel failed to secure the testimony of petitioner's only alibi witness, John Wornum.  While counsel has no obligation to render a sterling performance, counsel does have an obligation to render a reasonable performance under prevailing professional norms.  Based on the foregoing reasons, this court finds that petitioner has shown that trial counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Prejudice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such ineffective assistance on the part of trial counsel was also highly prejudicial.  This case consisted primarily of the victim's testimony against that of petitioner.  Without producing petitioner's alibi witness nor any character witnesses, trial counsel left petitioner to present his own version of the facts to the jury without collateral support.  Nor did trial counsel fully attempt to discredit the victim's testimony with her prior inconsistent statements or her delay in reporting the sexual assault.  There is no indication in the trial record that trial counsel offered into evidence the incident report or the subsequent police report, so that the jury could compare the discrepancies between the victim's prior descriptions and her subsequent testimony in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p222\">\n      <span class=\"num\">222</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state the obvious, there were no witnesses to the May 15, 1986, incident other than the victim and the assailant.  Impeachment evidence therefore becomes all the more vital.  The jury is entitled to consider this evidence.  It is also entitled to consider the testimony of petitioner's only alibi witness.  The Sixth Amendment demands no less.  Had the jury considered this evidence, heard the testimony of John Wornum and heard an effective closing argument marshaling these discrepancies, there is a strong possibility that, but for trial counsel's errors in neglecting to present this evidence, the result of petitioner's trial would have been different.  These cumulative errors taken as a whole are sufficient to undermine this court's confidence in the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is therefore RECOMMENDED<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> that the writ of habeas corpus be ALLOWED unless respondent, on behalf of the Commonwealth, promptly elects to grant petitioner a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p>Stephen Hrones and Murray Kuhn for the petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p225\">\n      <span class=\"num\">225</span>\n      <p>Linda Nutting Murphy for the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Wornum explained in a post-trial affidavit that he is a long-time friend of Matthews's family and that Matthews would sometimes call him his \"uncle\" or \"father\" even though the two are not related</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Counsel for the respondent, an assistant attorney general for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, dropped the \"reasonable probability\" language from this standard and misleadingly suggested to us that Strickland requires the defendant to prove that \"but for\" counsel's inadequacies, the verdict would have been different.

Given the strength of her identification of him as her assailant, it was essential that counsel try to deflate this aspect of Barbosa's testimony.  Moreover, it is a misstatement to say that there was \"irrefutable evidence\" that Barbosa failed to report the rape for an eighty-one day period.  While the initial police record does not indicate that a rape was part of the physical attack, and Ingersoll's grand jury testimony was that his first knowledge of that part of the attack came as a result of the probable cause hearing, there is nothing in the record stating unequivocally that Barbosa had not told other authorities of the alleged rape prior to the probable cause hearing</p>\n        <p>Finally, we respond to our brother's assertion that we give \"too much credence to certain ageist and sexist assumptions--that it would be improper to question closely (and risk arousing the emotions of) a young female sexual assault victim....\"  First, our assessment of the reasonableness of D'Arcy's strategy would be no different had the victim been a fourteen-year-old boy.  Second, lawyers must devise their strategies in light of how real jurors might react--not necessarily politically correct ones.  The dissent suggests that a lawyer who considers the unfashionable assumptions and reactions of jurors in crafting a strategy deserves less deference than does a lawyer who ignores them or decides that the jury will rise above them.  We disagree.  We do not dispute that D'Arcy could reasonably have chosen a strategy involving more aggressive and complete impeachment;  not doing so, in this case, was also within the \"wide range\" of reasonable professional choices recognized by the Strickland Court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We have also considered Matthews's claims that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel by D'Arcy's \"incoherent\" closing argument, his lack of preparation and his overall performance throughout the course of the trial.  Even if Matthews is correct that D'Arcy's performance in these areas was deficient, Matthews has not demonstrated, and the record does not lead us to believe, that the was a reasonable probability of a different outcome if D'Arcy had performed differently</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Petitioner was born in Trinidad, West Indies, and had lived in the Boston area for a period of 13 years.

A).  (Emphasis added).  As elaborated infra, petitioner contends that trial counsel failed to impeach the victim with this prior inconsistent statement that she had a more limited opportunity to view the assailant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Again, petitioner complains that trial counsel failed to impeach the victim concerning this discrepancy</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Petitioner points out that trial counsel neither objected nor requested an instruction when the prosecutor referred to petitioner as being present at the probable cause hearing.  (Tr. 2-27 &amp; 80-81).  Contrary to petitioner's argument, however, because the prosecutor did not refer specifically to petitioner's failure to testify or to offer evidence at the probable cause hearing, section 23 of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 278 is inapposite.  Moreover, as noted by the Appeals Court (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.  D), the trial judge instructed the jury concerning the criminal process (Tr. 3-39-40)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Petitioner repeats his allegation that trial counsel failed to impeach the victim regarding her estimated 81-day delay in reporting the sexual assault</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Petitioner complains that trial counsel failed to impeach the victim with her contrary statement before the grand jury.

C, p. 8).  (Emphasis Added).

The trial judge also intimated, albeit in an oblique manner, that trial counsel was not treating his case with an appropriate degree of seriousness.

(Docket Entry # 15, p. 23).  Tapes of the probable cause hearing are, however, apparently unavailable.  Nor did petitioner produce an affidavit depicting the particular statements.  Consequently, as discussed infra, this argument is unavailing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> The Appeals Court additionally stated that trial counsel's strategy was to \"stress the point that the victim identified the defendant solely because he had dreadlocks, as did her assailant.\"  (Docket Entry # 15, Ex.

Trial counsel neglected at this point to impeach the victim with the incident report which directly contradicts her trial testimony.  Testimony is as follows:</p>\n        <p>Q. But you didn't tell [Detective Ingersoll] about the fact that this man touched your private parts?</p>\n        <p>A. No, but I told the other cops when they came.</p>\n        <p>Q. When?</p>\n        <p>A. When it first happened, the cops that came over to the house.

In particular, this court lacks a copy of the state court exhibit list.  A review of the trial transcripts shows no reference to the admission of the incident report as an exhibit.  In the event this court is incorrect in its assumption, either party is invited to come forth with additional evidence regarding admission of the incident report within ten days of receipt of this Order</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> Trial counsel stated to the trial judge that, \"It's a disadvantage when you try to examine young ladies because of the fact that she's highly emotional.\"  (Tr. 2-62).  Similarly, to the jury during closing argument, he stated that:</p>\n        <p>Difficult job for myself to cross-examine a young girl in a case like this, because I could put one of my family in that position, anyone ... The main thing is that gentlemen have a tough time trying to probe into intimate matters with females.  The fact is that this fourteen year olders (sic) was at the brink of breaking up and getting hysterical.</p>\n        <p>(Tr. 3-12).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> Trial counsel also noted gaps in the testimony but failed to identify the specific gaps for the jury.  (Tr. 3-20).  Nor does the record reflect that the jury had the incident report to view the discrepancies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> As previously noted, trial counsel's reference to the victim's delay in voicing the sexual assault was brief and, without developing this argument, he summarily proceeded to discuss the fairness and delay surrounding petitioner's arrest.
