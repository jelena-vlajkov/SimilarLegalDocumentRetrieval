Pro  se  plaintiff  William Gabovitch,  a\r                            \r\n\ncertified  public  accountant  and  non-practicing  attorney,\r\n\nserved  for nearly  eighteen  years as  a  co-trustee of  two\r\n\nirrevocable inter vivos trusts created by Maurice Shear.   In\r\n\n1992, in connection with litigation filed in 1987 by Gertrude\r\n\nShear (Maurice's wife and  the contingent life beneficiary of\r\n\nthe  trusts), a state court  judge removed plaintiff from his\r\n\nposition  as  trustee  and  ordered him  to  pay  substantial\r\n\ndamages   because  of  his   mismanagement  of   the  trusts.\r\n\nPlaintiff's  appeal from  that  decision remains  pending  in\r\n\nstate  appellate court.    Claiming that  the allegations  of\r\n\nmismanagement were  frivolous and  that his removal  had been\r\n\nfraudulently obtained, plaintiff  pursued various  collateral\r\n\nactions in state court--all without avail.  He then turned to\r\n\nfederal court,  filing the instant civil  RICO action against\r\n\nthe  Shears  (and  others),  seeking  injunctive  relief  and\r\n\ndamages on behalf  of both himself  and the  trusts.  See  18\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.C.   1964(c).   The district court, following a  hearing,\r\n\ndismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.  Having\r\n\nreviewed  the  record  in  full,  and  having  construed  the\r\n\ncomplaint  in the  light  most favorable  to plaintiff,  see,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., Feinstein v.  Resolution Trust Corp.,  942 F.2d 34,  37\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991), we now affirm.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  While we  have accepted all well-pled  allegations in the\r\ncomplaint  as true  and  drawn all  reasonable inferences  in\r\nplaintiff's  favor,   there  is   an  inconsistency   in  his\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     Extended  discussion is  unnecessary.   To state  a RICO\r\n\nclaim,  plaintiff  was  required  to  allege that  defendants\r\n\nconducted  an enterprise  through  a pattern  of racketeering\r\n\nactivity.  See,  e.g., Libertad  v. Welch, 53  F.3d 428,  441\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1995).  As well, he was required to allege that he\r\n\nsuffered  injury in his business or property \"by reason of\" a\r\n\nRICO  violation.   18 U.S.C.    1964(c);  see,  e.g., Sedima,\r                                                                         \r\n\nS.P.R.L.  v.  Imrex  Co.,  473  U.S.  479, 496  (1985)  (\"the\r                                    \r\n\nplaintiff has standing if, and can only recover to the extent\r\n\nthat,  he has been injured in his business or property by the\r\n\nconduct  constituting the [RICO] violation\"); see also Holmes\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Securities  Investor Protection  Corp., 503 U.S.  258, 268\r                                                     \r\n\n(1992)  (RICO  plaintiff  must  allege, not  only  \"but  for\"\r\n\ncausation,  but  also  proximate  causation  requiring  \"some\r\n\ndirect relation between the injury asserted and the injurious\r\n\nconduct alleged\").\r\n\n     This causation requirement enables us, at the outset, to\r\n\nput  to  the side  vast  portions  of plaintiff's  voluminous\r\n\ncomplaint.    For  example, plaintiff  has  detailed numerous\r\n\ninstances  of  criminal  and  fraudulent  activity  allegedly\r\n\nundertaken by various of the defendants during the 1970's and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nnarrative.   The Shears' principal motivation  for filing the\r\n1987  lawsuit,  plaintiff  contends,  was to  remove  him  as\r\ntrustee  and  thereby gain  control  of  the trusts'  primary\r\nasset--the Mount Pleasant Hospital.  Yet  plaintiff elsewhere\r\nexplains  that the  trusts  had sold  their  interest in  the\r\nhospital  the previous  year  (and only  reacquired ownership\r\nthereof in 1991).\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n1980's.  Yet no contention is made that such conduct resulted\r\n\nin  injury to  plaintiff's business  or  property.   In turn,\r\n\nplaintiff  charges that  defendants  have engaged  in various\r\n\nmisdeeds  following his  ouster as  trustee in  January 1992.\r\n\nAgain,  such  actions  are  not linked  to  any  business  or\r\n\nproperty loss suffered by plaintiff.  We note  that plaintiff\r\n\nlacks  standing   to  complain   of  injury  to   the  trusts\r\n\nthemselves,  having been removed  as trustee by  the time the\r\n\ninstant suit was filed.   And the suggestion that  his status\r\n\nas  a potential creditor of the trusts grants him standing to\r\n\nsue on his own behalf  is misplaced.  See, e.g., id.  at 271;\r                                                                \r\n\nNational Enterprises v. Mellon  Financial Services, 847  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n251, 254 (5th Cir. 1988).\r\n\n     The  only business  or  property injury  alleged in  the\r\n\ncomplaint is  that stemming  from the state  court judgment--\r\n\ni.e.,  plaintiff's  loss  of  his position  as  trustee;  the\r\n\naccompanying  monetary damages;  the  resulting harm  to  his\r\n\nreputation and  client base; and the  legal expenses incurred\r\n\nin litigating that action.  The question thus becomes whether\r\n\nplaintiff  has set forth a predicate act of racketeering that\r\n\nhas proximately caused such injury.  Plaintiff insists he has\r\n\ndone  so in  two  respects.   He argues  that  the filing  by\r\n\ndefendants of the  state court  suit (as part  of a  broader,\r\n\nunlawful scheme) constituted attempted extortion in violation\r\n\nof  the Hobbs  Act, 18  U.S.C.    1951.   And he  argues that\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nGertrude Shear, by proffering false  affidavits and testimony\r\n\nto  the state court (allegedly at the behest of her husband),\r\n\ncommitted mail  fraud in violation of  18 U.S.C.   1341.   We\r\n\ndisagree that such  claims establish the  necessary predicate\r\n\nact.\r\n\n     Numerous courts have held that the filing of litigation-\r\n\n-no  matter  how  lacking  in merit--does  not  constitute  a\r\n\npredicate racketeering  act  of extortion.    \"If a  suit  is\r\n\ngroundless  or filed  in  bad faith,  the  law of  torts  may\r\n\nprovide  a remedy.  Resort  to a federal  criminal statute is\r\n\nunnecessary.\"   I.S. Joseph Co. v. J. Lauritzen A/S, 751 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n265,  267-68 (8th  Cir.  1984); accord,  e.g., First  Pacific\r                                                                         \r\n\nBancorp, Inc.  v.

Supp.  1134, 1143-45\r                                            \r\n\n(S.D.N.Y.  1987) (holding  that  malicious prosecution  claim\r\n\ndoes   not   constitute  predicate   act   of  racketeering).\r\n\nPlaintiff's reliance on Hall American Center Assocs. v. Dick,\r                                                                        \r\n\n726  F. Supp. 1083 (E.D. Mich. 1989), proves unavailing.  The\r\n\ndefendants there had engaged in spurious litigation described\r\n\nby the  district court as a \"clear abuse of process.\"  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n1086.  The defendants here prevailed in the state court suit.\r\n\nAnd Lemelson v. Wang Laboratories, Inc., 874 F. Supp. 430 (D.\r                                                   \r\n\nMass. 1994),  offers minimal  succor to plaintiff,  since the\r\n\ncourt there was addressing the subject of RICO  injury rather\r\n\nthan predicate acts.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n     Plaintiff's  mail fraud claim likewise proves deficient.\r\n\nFor one thing, it  lacks the specificity required by  Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv. P. 9(b).  See, e.g.,  New England Data Services, Inc. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBecher, 829 F.2d  286, 290  (1st Cir. 1987).2   Moreover,  to\r                  \r\n\nthe  extent  his  argument  amounts to  the  allegation  that\r\n\nGertrude  Shear committed  perjury,  his cause  would not  be\r\n\nadvanced; perjury does not constitute an act of racketeering.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  Pyramid Securities, Ltd. v.  IB Resolution, Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n924 F.2d  1114, 1118-19 (D.C.

See, e.g., United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Ct.  1840\r                                                     \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The   suggestion   that   the    information   concerning\r\ndefendants' use of the mails was in their exclusive control--\r\nsuch that plaintiff  should be allowed to amend his complaint\r\nfollowing further  discovery, see, e.g., Becher,  829 F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n290--falls  short.   As  a party  to  the state  court  suit,\r\nplaintiff obviously was  (or should have  been) aware of  the\r\ncircumstances  surrounding  the  defendants'   submission  of\r\nallegedly  fraudulent affidavits  to the  court.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\nFeinstein, 942 F.2d  at 44 (\"Although  Becher may in  certain\r                                                         \r\ncircumstances give  a plaintiff a  second bite at  the apple,\r\nits  generous formulation  is  not automatically  bestowed on\r\nevery litigant.\").\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n(1993);  see  also Midwest  Grinding Co.  v. Spitz,  976 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n1016, 1022-23 (7th Cir. 1992) (leaving question open).  Here,\r\n\nhowever, perjury is  said to constitute the  entire means for\r\n\nperpetrating the fraud.  As well, the Midwest Grinding  court\r                                                                  \r\n\nnoted that in cases \"allowing perjury to serve as a predicate\r\n\nact  [by  way  of a  mail  fraud  or  obstruction of  justice\r\n\nallegation], ...  the defendant had either  been convicted of\r\n\nperjury before the civil RICO action commenced or had perjury\r\n\nestablished as  a matter of record in a separate proceeding.\"\r\n\nId. at 1022 n.3 (citations omitted).  Nothing of the sort has\r               \r\n\noccurred  here; quite to the contrary, the state court deemed\r\n\nGertrude Shear's evidence credible.  \r\n\n     In   essence,  simply   by  alleging   that  defendants'\r\n\nlitigation stance  in the state court  case was \"fraudulent,\"\r\n\nplaintiff is insisting upon a right to relitigate that entire\r\n\ncase  in federal court (while the case remains pending in the\r\n\nstate appellate court).  The  RICO statute obviously was  not\r\n\nmeant  to endorse any such occurrence.  Cf. Willis v. Lipton,\r                                                                        \r\n\n947 F.2d 998,  1001 (1st  Cir. 1991) (\"An  extension of  RICO\r\n\nstanding in these circumstances would serve to 'federalize' a\r\n\nsubstantial   volume   of   common   law   fraud   litigation\r\n\ntraditionally left to state courts.\").3\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Plaintiff's  two  remaining  arguments  can   be  readily\r\nrejected.  The  district court  was not  required to  convert\r\ndefendants' motion  to dismiss into one  for summary judgment\r\nbefore  taking judicial notice of court papers from the state\r\ncourt  litigation.  See, e.g.,  Edward v. John Hancock Mutual\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nLife Ins.

In 1992, in connection with litigation filed in 1987 by Gertrude Shear (Maurice's wife and the contingent life beneficiary of the trusts), a state court judge removed plaintiff from his position as trustee and ordered him to pay substantial damages because of his mismanagement of the trusts.  Plaintiff's appeal from that decision remains pending in state appellate court.  Claiming that the allegations of mismanagement were frivolous and that his removal had been fraudulently obtained, plaintiff pursued various collateral actions in state court--all without avail.  He then turned to federal court, filing the instant civil RICO action against the Shears (and others), seeking injunctive relief and damages on behalf of both himself and the trusts.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c).  The district court, following a hearing, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.  Having reviewed the record in full, and having construed the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiff, see, e.g., Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 37 (1st Cir.1991), we now affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Extended discussion is unnecessary.  To state a RICO claim, plaintiff was required to allege that defendants conducted an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.  See, e.g., Libertad v. Welch, 53 F.3d 428, 441 (1st Cir.1995).  As well, he was required to allege that he suffered injury in his business or property \"by reason of\" a RICO violation.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964(c);  see, e.g., Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985) (\"the plaintiff has standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the [RICO] violation\");  see also Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992) (RICO plaintiff must allege, not only \"but for\" causation, but also proximate causation requiring \"some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This causation requirement enables us, at the outset, to put to the side vast portions of plaintiff's voluminous complaint.  For example, plaintiff has detailed numerous instances of criminal and fraudulent activity allegedly undertaken by various of the defendants during the 1970's and 1980's.  Yet no contention is made that such conduct resulted in injury to plaintiff's business or property.  In turn, plaintiff charges that defendants have engaged in various misdeeds following his ouster as trustee in January 1992.  Again, such actions are not linked to any business or property loss suffered by plaintiff.  We note that plaintiff lacks standing to complain of injury to the trusts themselves, having been removed as trustee by the time the instant suit was filed.  And the suggestion that his status as a potential creditor of the trusts grants him standing to sue on his own behalf is misplaced.  See, e.g., id. at 271;  National Enterprises v. Mellon Financial Services, 847 F.2d 251, 254 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only business or property injury alleged in the complaint is that stemming from the state court judgment--i.e., plaintiff's loss of his position as trustee;  the accompanying monetary damages;  the resulting harm to his reputation and client base;  and the legal expenses incurred in litigating that action.  The question thus becomes whether plaintiff has set forth a predicate act of racketeering that has proximately caused such injury.  Plaintiff insists he has done so in two respects.  He argues that the filing by defendants of the state court suit (as part of a broader, unlawful scheme) constituted attempted extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951.  And he argues that Gertrude Shear, by proffering false affidavits and testimony to the state court (allegedly at the behest of her husband), committed mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341.  We disagree that such claims establish the necessary predicate act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Numerous courts have held that the filing of litigation--no matter how lacking in merit--does not constitute a predicate racketeering act of extortion.  \"If a suit is groundless or filed in bad faith, the law of torts may provide a remedy.  Resort to a federal criminal statute is unnecessary.\"  I.S. Joseph Co. v. J. Lauritzen A/S, 751 F.2d 265, 267-68 (8th Cir.1984);  accord, e.g., First Pacific Bancorp, Inc. v. BRO, 847 F.2d 542, 545 (9th Cir.1988);  von Bulow by Auersperg v. von Bulow, 657 F.Supp. 1134, 1143-45 (S.D.N.Y.1987) (holding that malicious prosecution claim does not constitute predicate act of racketeering).  Plaintiff's reliance on Hall American Center Assocs. v. Dick, 726 F.Supp. 1083 (E.D.Mich.1989), proves unavailing.  The defendants there had engaged in spurious litigation described by the district court as a \"clear abuse of process.\"  Id. at 1086.  The defendants here prevailed in the state court suit.  And Lemelson v. Wang Laboratories, Inc., 874 F.Supp. 430 (D.Mass.1994), offers minimal succor to plaintiff, since the court there was addressing the subject of RICO injury rather than predicate acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's mail fraud claim likewise proves deficient.  For one thing, it lacks the specificity required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).  See, e.g., New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286, 290 (1st Cir.1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Moreover, to the extent his argument amounts to the allegation that Gertrude Shear committed perjury, his cause would not be advanced;  perjury does not constitute an act of racketeering.  See, e.g., Pyramid Securities, Ltd. v. IB Resolution, Inc., 924 F.2d 1114, 1118-19 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 822 (1991);  United States v. Williams, 874 F.2d 968, 973 n. 17 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, as plaintiff observes, several courts have indicated that a mail fraud claim premised largely on charges of perjury can suffice as a predicate act.  See, e.g., United States v. Eisen, 974 F.2d 246, 254 (2d Cir.1992) (\"use of the mail fraud offense as a RICO predicate act cannot be suspended simply because perjury is part of the means for perpetrating the fraud\"), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 1840 (1993);  see also Midwest Grinding Co. v. Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016, 1022-23 (7th Cir.1992) (leaving question open).  Here, however, perjury is said to constitute the entire means for perpetrating the fraud.  As well, the Midwest Grinding court noted that in cases \"allowing perjury to serve as a predicate act [by way of a mail fraud or obstruction of justice allegation], ... the defendant had either been convicted of perjury before the civil RICO action commenced or had perjury established as a matter of record in a separate proceeding.\"  Id. at 1022 n. 3 (citations omitted).  Nothing of the sort has occurred here;  quite to the contrary, the state court deemed Gertrude Shear's evidence credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, simply by alleging that defendants' litigation stance in the state court case was \"fraudulent,\" plaintiff is insisting upon a right to relitigate that entire case in federal court (while the case remains pending in the state appellate court).  The RICO statute obviously was not meant to endorse any such occurrence.  Cf. Willis v. Lipton, 947 F.2d 998, 1001 (1st Cir.1991) (\"An extension of RICO standing in these circumstances would serve to 'federalize' a substantial volume of common law fraud litigation traditionally left to state courts.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While we have accepted all well-pled allegations in the complaint as true and drawn all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor, there is an inconsistency in his narrative.  The Shears' principal motivation for filing the 1987 lawsuit, plaintiff contends, was to remove him as trustee and thereby gain control of the trusts' primary asset--the Mount Pleasant Hospital.  Yet plaintiff elsewhere explains that the trusts had sold their interest in the hospital the previous year (and only reacquired ownership thereof in 1991)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The suggestion that the information concerning defendants' use of the mails was in their exclusive control--such that plaintiff should be allowed to amend his complaint following further discovery, see, e.g., Becher, 829 F.2d at 290--falls short.  As a party to the state court suit, plaintiff obviously was (or should have been) aware of the circumstances surrounding the defendants' submission of allegedly fraudulent affidavits to the court.  See, e.g., Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 44 (\"Although Becher may in certain circumstances give a plaintiff a second bite at the apple, its generous formulation is not automatically bestowed on every litigant.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff's two remaining arguments can be readily rejected.  The district court was not required to convert defendants' motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment before taking judicial notice of court papers from the state court litigation.  See, e.g., Edward v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., 973 F.2d 1027, 1030 n. 1 (1st Cir.1992);  Mack v. South Bay Beer Distributors, Inc., 798 F.2d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir.1986).  Nor did it abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff's post-judgment request to amend his complaint (following further discovery), where any such amendment would have been futile.  See, e.g., Arzuaga-Collazo v. Oriental Federal Sav. Bank, 913 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1990);  Nodine v. Textron, Inc., 819 F.2d 347, 349 (1st Cir.1987)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

As well, the Midwest Grinding court noted that in cases \"allowing perjury to serve as a predicate act [by way of a mail fraud or obstruction of justice allegation], ... the defendant had either been convicted of perjury before the civil RICO action commenced or had perjury established as a matter of record in a separate proceeding.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592115\"><a href=\"/opinion/592115/midwest-grinding-company-inc-an-illinois-corporation-cross-appellee-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1022 </a></span>n. 3 (citations omitted).  Nothing of the sort has occurred here;  quite to the contrary, the state court deemed Gertrude Shear's evidence credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, simply by alleging that defendants' litigation stance in the state court case was \"fraudulent,\" plaintiff is insisting upon a right to relitigate that entire case in federal court (while the case remains pending in the state appellate court).  The RICO statute obviously was not meant to endorse any such occurrence.  Cf. Willis v. Lipton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571057\"><a href=\"/opinion/571057/dana-willis-v-kevin-lipton/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></a></span>, 1001 (1st Cir.1991) (\"An extension of RICO standing in these circumstances would serve to 'federalize' a substantial volume of common law fraud litigation traditionally left to state courts.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While we have accepted all well-pled allegations in the complaint as true and drawn all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor, there is an inconsistency in his narrative.  The Shears' principal motivation for filing the 1987 lawsuit, plaintiff contends, was to remove him as trustee and thereby gain control of the trusts' primary asset--the Mount Pleasant Hospital.  Yet plaintiff elsewhere explains that the trusts had sold their interest in the hospital the previous year (and only reacquired ownership thereof in 1991)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The suggestion that the information concerning defendants' use of the mails was in their exclusive control--such that plaintiff should be allowed to amend his complaint following further discovery, see, e.g., Becher, 829 F.2d at 290--falls short.  As a party to the state court suit, plaintiff obviously was (or should have been) aware of the circumstances surrounding the defendants' submission of allegedly fraudulent affidavits to the court.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566797\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Feinstein,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/566797/william-c-feinstein-v-resolution-trust-corporation-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">44</span> </a></span>(\"Although Becher may in certain circumstances give a plaintiff a second bite at the apple, its generous formulation is not automatically bestowed on every litigant.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff's two remaining arguments can be readily rejected.  The district court was not required to convert defendants' motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment before taking judicial notice of court papers from the state court litigation.  See, e.g., Edward v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589966\"><a href=\"/opinion/589966/a-greer-edwards-jr-v-john-hancock-mutual-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span>, 1030 n. 1 (1st Cir.1992);  Mack v.

Nor did it abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff's post-judgment request to amend his complaint (following further discovery), where any such amendment would have been futile.

Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547466\"><a href=\"/opinion/547466/jose-lorenzo-arzuaga-collazo-v-oriental-federal-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1990);  Nodine v.
