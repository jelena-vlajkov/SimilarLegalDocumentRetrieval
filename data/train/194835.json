Russell on brief pro se.\n                     \n   Michael L.  Paup, Acting Assistant Attorney  General, Robert\n                                                               \nE. Lindsay,  Alan Hechtkopf  and Karen  M. Quesnel,  Tax Division\n                                                \nDepartment of Justice, on brief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per Curiam.  The appellant, William  S. Russell, owned a\n               \n\nbusiness in  New Hampshire.  He  and his wife  took no salary\n\nfrom the business, but they used substantial amounts of money\n\nfrom corporate  accounts  to  pay  their  personal  expenses,\n\nfailed  to declare the payments as income, and failed to file\n\nindividual and corporate income tax returns.  Russell pleaded\n\nguilty  to  one count  of  conspiracy to  defraud  the United\n\nStates,  18  U.S.C.    371, and  three  counts of  income tax\n\nevasion, 26  U.S.C.   7201, and received a twenty-seven month\n\nprison sentence.\n\n     Russell, who  was  represented  by  counsel  before  the\n\ndistrict court  but appears  pro se here,  challenges neither\n                                   \n\nhis plea nor his sentence, but argues that the indictment was\n\n\"false and  fraudulent\" because  it charged him  with evading\n\nthe income tax  by, among  other things, failing  to file  an\n\nincome  tax return.  According  to Russell, the indictment is\n\ntherefore contradictory because without a return the Internal\n\nRevenue  Service cannot  make a  valid assessment,  without a\n\nvalid assessment there can  be no tax liability,  and without\n\nliability there can be no evasion.\n\n     This  is incorrect.  The crime of income tax evasion has\n\nthree  elements:  (1) willfulness,  (2)  existence  of a  tax\n\ndeficiency,  and  (3)  an  affirmative  act  constituting  an\n\nevasion or attempted evasion  of the tax.

Hogan, 861 F.2d 312,  315 (1st Cir. 1988).  As long\n               \n\nas the  tax is  \"due  and owing\"  in this  manner, no  formal\n\nassessment is necessary.  Id.\n                             \n\n     Russell's  other arguments  are  equally without  merit.\n\nFirst, he was required by statute to make a return, 26 U.S.C.\n\n  6012, and pay the tax owed.  26 U.S.C.   6151.  Second, the\n\nrequirement that he file  a return did not violate  the Self-\n\nIncrimination  Clause of  the  Fifth Amendment.

Finally,\n                   \n\nthe district court had subject-matter jurisdiction, 18 U.S.C.\n\n   3231,  as  well  as \"territorial\"  jurisdiction  over  the\n\nprosecution.
