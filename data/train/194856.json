This  appeal\n                                            \n\nconcerns   the  limitations  period   for  filing  employment\n\ndiscrimination charges under Title VII.  Appellant Wandwossen\n\nKassaye was employed since 1986 as an associate professor  of\n\nmarketing by  Bryant College, a private  institution in Rhode\n\nIsland.  Kassaye is a black male and a United States national\n\nborn  in  Ethiopia.   In 1988,  Kassaye  applied for  and was\n\ndenied tenure by  Bryant.   Nevertheless, Bryant  reappointed\n\nKassaye as an associate  professor for the 1989-1990 academic\n\nyear.    He reapplied  for tenure  in  August 1989.   College\n\nofficials informed  Kassaye in writing on  December 18, 1989,\n\nthat he  would not be  granted tenure.  On  January 20, 1990,\n\nappellee William  E. Trueheart, president of  Bryant College,\n\nofficially confirmed  the tenure denial and  notified Kassaye\n\nthat his employment would end on July 31, 1990.\n\n          Kassaye  continued teaching  at Bryant  through the\n\nspring semester.  On June  8, 1990, the marketing  department\n\nchairman,  appellee Frank Bingham, sent Kassaye the following\n\nmemorandum:\n\n          Please make arrangements  to vacate  your\n          office no  later than July 1,  1990.  The\n                               \n          office  has  been  assigned   to  another\n          faculty member who  will be moving  in on\n          July 1, thus the reason for this request.\n          If this presents a problem, please advise\n          as  I  am  willing   to  do  one  of  the\n          following:\n\n               *    Have   Maintenance  pack   your\n                    books,  etc.   in  cartons  and\n                    store in a secure space\n\n                             -3-\n\n               *    Try to find  a temporary  space\n                    for your belongings, which will\n                    give you the option  of packing\n                    the books, etc. yourself.  This\n                    will   be    difficult   (maybe\n                    impossible)  but  I will  do my\n                    best if requested\n\n          These \"options\" should  not be  necessary\n          as the July 1 date is  a full three weeks\n          away giving you ample opportunity to pack\n          and   move.      Thank   you   for   your\n          cooperation.\n\nKassaye protested the request to vacate his office before the\n\nexpiration  of his contract.   In  a June  26, 1990,  memo to\n\nappellee  James  W.  Robinson,  vice  president  for academic\n\naffairs, Kassaye wrote:\n\n          I understand my  contract expires on July\n          31, 1900.  [sic]   Until then, I continue\n          to  honor  my contractual  obligations to\n          the  College  and  perform  my  committee\n          duties as  required.   In that  spirit, I\n          have attended the CCAS interview sessions\n          earlier this month.\n\n          Needless to say,  I strongly protest  the\n          request to vacate  the office before July\n          31.    I  find  the action  a  breach  of\n          contact [sic], and  further testimony  to\n          the   continued   harassment  I'm   being\n          subjected to.   I think what  was done is\n          unprofessional and detestable.\n\nOn July 2, 1990, Bingham again wrote to Kassaye:\n\n          I regret  that you  will not  vacate your\n          office  as  I  requested.    Although the\n          office  is  needed  badly to  accommodate\n          several moves, I  will honor your request\n          to remain until July 31.\n\n          Although  I  recognize   that  you   have\n          negative  feelings   about  being  denied\n          tenure, your failure to  accommodate this\n          move inconveniences only persons who were\n\n                             -4-\n\n          not   even   Bryant  employees   when  it\n          happened.\n\nKassaye retained access to  his office until the last  day of\n\nhis employment, July 31, 1990.\n\n          On  November 19,  1990, Kassaye  filed a  charge of\n\ndiscrimination with  the  Rhode Island  Commission for  Human\n\nRights (\"RICHR\"), alleging that Bryant  College discriminated\n\nagainst  him on  the basis  of his  race, color  and national\n\norigin.  Kassaye  is automatically deemed  to have filed  the\n\nsame charge with the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(\"EEOC\") on January 18,  1991, sixty days after he  filed the\n\nRICHR charge.  See 29 C.F.R.   1601.13(b).\n                  \n\n          The RICHR and the EEOC issued  right-to-sue letters\n\nin  July and  October 1991,  respectively, and  Kassaye filed\n\nthis civil action for  injunctive and monetary relief  in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Rhode Island\n\non  October 16,  1991.   The  complaint  alleged that  Bryant\n\nCollege  and college  administrators  William  E.  Trueheart,\n\nJames W.  Robinson, Michael  B. Patterson, and  Frank Bingham\n\nviolated  section 703(a)(1) of Title VII  of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C.   2000e-2(a)(1) \"by denying his tenure\n\nand thereby terminating his  employment\" because of his race,\n\ncolor and national origin.   The complaint also alleged  that\n\n                             -5-\n\nthe  tenure  denial  constituted,  under  Rhode  Island  law,\n\ntortious conduct and breach of contract.1\n\n          The  district court  granted  summary judgment  for\n\ndefendants on the Title VII claims on the ground that Kassaye\n\ndid  not file  his  charge of  discrimination  with the  EEOC\n\nwithin  the 300-day limitations period set out in 42 U.S.C.  \n\n2000e-5(e).      Lacking   any  other   basis   for   federal\n\njurisdiction, the district court dismissed  the pendant state\n\nlaw  claims.  See  Newman v. Burgin,  930 F.2d  955, 963 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir. 1991). \n\n          On  appeal, Kassaye  disputes the  district court's\n\nconclusion  that his  EEOC  charge was  untimely  filed.   42\n\nU.S.C.     2000e-5(e)  defines  the  limitations  period  for\n\ncharges of unlawful employment practices:\n\n               A charge under this section shall be\n          filed [with the EEOC] within  one hundred\n          and   eighty   days  after   the  alleged\n          unlawful  employment   practice  occurred\n          . . . ,  except  that  in  a  case  of an\n          unlawful employment practice with respect\n          to   which   the  person   aggrieved  has\n          initially  instituted proceedings  with a\n          State or local  agency with authority  to\n          grant or  seek relief from  such practice\n          . . . , such charge shall  be filed by or\n          on  behalf of the person aggrieved within\n\n                    \n\n1.   The complaint was amended once to add a copy of the EEOC\nright-to-sue letter.   The  amended complaint is  referred to\nherein as \"the complaint.\"\n\n                             -6-\n\n          three  hundred  days  after  the  alleged\n          unlawfulemployment\n                           practiceoccurred. . . .2\n\nIt is undisputed that  the 300-day limitations period applied\n\nhere,3  and that the filing date of Kassaye's charge for EEOC\n\npurposes  was January 18, 1991.   It is  also undisputed that\n\nKassaye received actual notice  of the tenure denial,  at the\n\nlatest,  by January 20,  1990.4  Thus,  Kassaye's EEOC charge\n\nwas timely only if \"the alleged unlawful employment practice\"\n\n                    \n\n2.   This portion of 42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(e) is now designated\nas paragraph (1).  See Civil  Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No.\n                      \n102-166, Title I,   112, 105 Stat. 1071, 1078-79 (1991).  The\nredesignation of this text and the  addition of new paragraph\n(2), concerning seniority systems,  do not affect the outcome\nof appellant's case.\n\n3.   All parties assume    as the EEOC itself has declared   \nthat Rhode Island is  a deferral state for purposes  of Title\nVII, and  thus that the 300-day period  applies here.  See 29\n                                                          \nC.F.R.     1601.70(a), 1601.74(a).   A deferral state  is one\nwith an \"agency with  authority to grant or seek  relief from\nsuch [unlawful employment] practice[s].\"   42 U.S.C.   2000e-\n5(e).   In a deferral state, the EEOC defers consideration of\na discrimination charge  until the  appropriate state  agency\nhas  had up  to sixty  days to act  on the  charge.   Id.; 29\n                                                         \nC.F.R.    1601.13(a)(3)-(4),  (b).   If the  aggrieved person\nfiles  a  claim  first with  a  state  or local  agency  in a\ndeferral state, he has 300 days, instead of 180 days, to file\na charge with the EEOC.   42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(e); Cajigas  v.\n                                                         \nBanco de Ponce, 741 F.2d 464, 467 n.8 (1st Cir. 1984).  Given\n              \nthe parties' agreement that Rhode Island is a deferral state,\nwe  need not resolve the issue  ourselves, but simply proceed\non that assumption.  Compare, e.g., Cajigas, 741 F.2d at 467;\n                                           \nGoldman v. Sears,  Roebuck &amp;  Co., 607 F.2d  1014, 1017  (1st\n                                 \nCir. 1979).  \n\n4.   It  is possible  that Kassaye  received final  notice on\nDecember  18,  1989,  when  the vice  president  of  academic\naffairs notified him of the tenure decision by memo.  We need\nnot determine  whether adequate  notice was received  on that\nearlier date,  however, since even if  the limitations period\ndid  not commence until January 20, 1990, the EEOC charge was\nstill out of time.\n\n                             -7-\n\noccurred within 300  days before January  18, 1991.   Kassaye\n\nconcedes that if, as the district court held, the gravamen of\n\nhis complaint was the tenure denial, his charge was filed too\n\nlate  because it was not  filed until 363  days after January\n\n20, 1990.  See Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250,\n                                              \n\n258  (1980)  (holding  that  the  limitations  period  for  a\n\ndiscrimination  charge based  on  tenure  denial begins  when\n\naggrieved person receives notice of  denial, not on the  last\n\nday of employment).\n\n          Kassaye's   administratively-filed   discrimination\n\ncharge,  and  his subsequent  civil  complaint  filed in  the\n\ndistrict court,  centered upon  the denial  of tenure.   Only\n\nafter  defendants  raised  the  limitations  problem  in  the\n\ndistrict  court, in  their motion  for summary  judgment, did\n\nKassaye  put forward  his  current theory:  that there  was a\n\ncontinuing violation of  Title VII that ended within the 300-\n\nday limitations period.5   If a Title  VII violation is of  a\n\n                    \n\n5.   Appellees do  not contest appellant's right to do so, so\nwe  shall  assume without  deciding  that  appellant was  not\nprecluded from raising the continuing violation theory in his\nopposition  to summary  judgment.   See  Cajigas v.  Banco de\n                                                             \nPonce, 741  F.2d 464, 468 n.12 (1st Cir. 1984).  But see Mack\n                                                             \nv. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179,  183-84 (1st Cir.\n                            \n1989) (warning future litigants that the continuing violation\ntheory should be spelled out clearly in their complaints).  \n     It is nonetheless noteworthy that the June 8th memo  was\nneither  emphasized  nor  discussed in  appellant's  original\ndiscrimination charge and complaint.   See Ricks, 449 U.S. at\n                                                \n257  n.8.  Appellant  wrote on the form  filed with the RICHR\nthat  the most  recent  act of  discrimination took  place on\nJanuary 20, 1990     the date he received official  notice of\nthe  tenure   denial.     His  description  of   the  alleged\n\n                             -8-\n\ncontinuing nature, the  charge of  discrimination filed  with\n\nthe appropriate agency may be timely as to all discriminatory\n\nacts  encompassed by the violation  so long as  the charge is\n\nfiled  during  the  life  of  the  violation  or  within  the\n\nstatutory period  (e.g., 300  days) which commences  upon the\n\nviolation's  termination.  Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co.,\n                                                            \n\n871 F.2d 179, 183 (1st Cir. 1989); Cajigas v. Banco de Ponce,\n                                                            \n\n741  F.2d 464, 469 (1st Cir. 1984); Goldman v. Sears, Roebuck\n                                                             \n\n&amp; Co., 607 F.2d 1014, 1018 (1st Cir. 1979).  \n     \n\n          There  are  two  kinds  of  continuing  violations:\n\nsystemic and serial.  Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 522 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.  1990).  Kassaye does not assert that what happened here\n\nfits within  the former definition.  What  Kassaye now argues\n\nis that the record discloses a series of discriminatory acts,\n                                     \n\nbeginning at a time  unspecified and ending on June  8, 1990,\n\nwhen Bingham asked  him to  vacate his office.   These  acts,\n\nsaid  to constitute harassment of Kassaye on the basis of his\n\nrace, color  and national  origin, included assigning  him to\n\nteach  a  class he  did not  wish  to teach,  relying  on the\n\nevaluations  of white  peers  and students  in making  tenure\n\n                    \n\ndiscrimination, in  both the  charge form and  his complaint,\nfocused  almost  exclusively on  the  details  of the  tenure\ndenial.   Only one sentence on his discrimination charge form\nmentioned  the request  that  he vacate  his  office a  month\nearly.  The complaint did  not even allege that the June  8th\nincident occurred, but merely  referred to the discrimination\ncharge  form    which itself only mentioned the memo    as an\nexhibit.\n\n                             -9-\n\ndecisions, denying him tenure,  and asking him to  vacate his\n\noffice.   Because  the last  of  these purported  serial acts\n\noccurred  on June  8, 1990,  Kassaye contends  that the  EEOC\n\ncharge was filed during the 300-day limitations period, viz.,\n\n224 days after June 8, 1990.\n\n          A  serial violation  is described  as \"a  number of\n\ndiscriminatory  acts emanating  from the  same discriminatory\n\nanimus,  each  act constituting  a separate  wrong actionable\n\nunder  Title VII.\"  Sabree v. United Bhd. of Carpenters Local\n                                                             \n\n33,  921 F.2d 396, 400  (1st Cir. 1990)  (quoting Jensen, 912\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at  522).   The mere  effects  or consequences  of past\n\ndiscrimination,  as  opposed   to  independently   actionable\n\nviolations  of Title  VII, are insufficient  to serve  as the\n\ntrigger of the limitations  period.

For  appellant's\n\ncontinuing  violation theory to  succeed, that  incident must\n\nhave constituted an  independently actionable  discriminatory\n\n                             -10-\n\nact,  and not have been  merely a consequence  of the earlier\n\ntenure denial.  Mack, 871 F.2d at 183.\n                    \n\n          We  do not think that Kassaye has raised a  genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether the June 8  incident was\n\nan actionable Title VII violation.   The ultimate question in\n\nany  Title  VII  claim  is whether  the  defendant's  alleged\n\nconduct was discriminatory.   St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks,\n                                                            \n\nNo. 92-602,  61  U.S.L.W. 4782,  4786 (U.S.  June 25,  1993);\n\nGoldman, 607 F.2d at  1019.  However, nothing in  this record\n       \n\nsuggests, directly  or indirectly,  that the request  to move\n\nwas  discriminatory.    The  request  was  not  on  its  face\n\nunreasonable, given  the unrebutted need to accommodate other\n\nfaculty  members who were staying  on.  There  is no evidence\n\nthat,  by  asking Kassaye  to vacate  his  office on  July 1,\n\nBingham was treating Kassaye any differently from the  way he\n\nhad, or would have, treated other non-black and non-Ethiopian\n\nprofessors  who had been denied tenure.  See, e.g., Mack, 871\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at  182   (affirming  summary  judgment   dismissal  of\n\ndiscrimination claim where plaintiff offered no evidence that\n\nsimilarly   situated,  male   employees  were   treated  more\n\nfavorably  than she);  Cajigas, 741  F.2d at  468 (dismissing\n                              \n\nclaim  because  plaintiff failed  to  allege  that employer's\n\nrefusal to offer equal pay  and promotions to her constituted\n\ndifferent  treatment  from  that  afforded  males  in similar\n\nsituations); Underwood v.

August  v. Offices  Unlimited, Inc.\n                                                             \n\n981 F.2d 576, 580  (1st Cir. 1992).  The only record evidence\n\nregarding the office incident  are the three memos reproduced\n\nin full supra, showing simply that Kassaye was asked to leave\n             \n\nhis  office a month before  his contract expired  in order to\n\npermit  another faculty  member  to move  in.   When  Kassaye\n\nrefused to move, he was told he could stay until his contract\n\nran out.   The request to move had been  politely phrased and\n\nwas accompanied by a stated willingness to take certain steps\n\nhelpful to Kassaye if moving out presented a problem.  In his\n\nsubsequent letter  honoring Kassaye's request  to stay  until\n\nJuly  31,  Bingham  spoke of  needing  the  office  \"badly to\n\naccommodate several moves.\"  While Kassaye viewed the request\n\nas \"unprofessional and detestable,\" we are unable to see that\n\nthe  mere making of it  provided grounds for  an inference of\n\ndiscrimination.  Asking a teacher whose contract was about to\n\nexpire to  vacate his office  a few weeks  early in  favor of\n\nsomeone who  would be teaching next fall was a mere effect of\n\nthe past, allegedly discriminatory,  act of refusing to renew\n\n                             -12-\n\nappellant's employment at Bryant College.  It was the latter,\n\nif anything, which provided grounds for complaint.\n\n          Because  the  events  of   June  8,  1990  did  not\n\nconstitute an actionable violation of Title VII, there was no\n\ncontinuing  violation extending into  the 300-day limitations\n\nperiod.   The district court correctly  held that appellant's\n\nEEOC  charge was  not timely  filed.   Because we  affirm the\n\ndistrict  court's  dismissal of  Kassaye's  complaint  on the\n\nlimitations ground,the other issuesraised by Kassayeare moot.\n\n          Affirmed.

This  appeal\n                                            \n\nconcerns   the  limitations  period   for  filing  employment\n\ndiscrimination charges under Title VII.  Appellant Wandwossen\n\nKassaye was employed since 1986 as an associate professor  of\n\nmarketing by  Bryant College, a private  institution in Rhode\n\nIsland.  Kassaye is a black male and a United States national\n\nborn  in  Ethiopia.   In 1988,  Kassaye  applied for  and was\n\ndenied tenure by  Bryant.   Nevertheless, Bryant  reappointed\n\nKassaye as an associate  professor for the 1989-1990 academic\n\nyear.    He reapplied  for tenure  in  August 1989.   College\n\nofficials informed  Kassaye in writing on  December 18, 1989,\n\nthat he  would not be  granted tenure.  On  January 20, 1990,\n\nappellee William  E. Trueheart, president of  Bryant College,\n\nofficially confirmed  the tenure denial and  notified Kassaye\n\nthat his employment would end on July 31, 1990.\n\n          Kassaye  continued teaching  at Bryant  through the\n\nspring semester.  On June  8, 1990, the marketing  department\n\nchairman,  appellee Frank Bingham, sent Kassaye the following\n\nmemorandum:\n\n          Please make arrangements  to vacate  your\n          office no  later than July 1,  1990.  The\n                               \n          office  has  been  assigned   to  another\n          faculty member who  will be moving  in on\n          July 1, thus the reason for this request.\n          If this presents a problem, please advise\n          as  I  am  willing   to  do  one  of  the\n          following:\n\n               *    Have   Maintenance  pack   your\n                    books,  etc.   in  cartons  and\n                    store in a secure space\n\n                             -3-\n\n               *    Try to find  a temporary  space\n                    for your belongings, which will\n                    give you the option  of packing\n                    the books, etc. yourself.  This\n                    will   be    difficult   (maybe\n                    impossible)  but  I will  do my\n                    best if requested\n\n          These \"options\" should  not be  necessary\n          as the July 1 date is  a full three weeks\n          away giving you ample opportunity to pack\n          and   move.      Thank   you   for   your\n          cooperation.\n\nKassaye protested the request to vacate his office before the\n\nexpiration  of his contract.   In  a June  26, 1990,  memo to\n\nappellee  James  W.  Robinson,  vice  president  for academic\n\naffairs, Kassaye wrote:\n\n          I understand my  contract expires on July\n          31, 1900.  [sic]   Until then, I continue\n          to  honor  my contractual  obligations to\n          the  College  and  perform  my  committee\n          duties as  required.   In that  spirit, I\n          have attended the CCAS interview sessions\n          earlier this month.\n\n          Needless to say,  I strongly protest  the\n          request to vacate  the office before July\n          31.    I  find  the action  a  breach  of\n          contact [sic], and  further testimony  to\n          the   continued   harassment  I'm   being\n          subjected to.   I think what  was done is\n          unprofessional and detestable.\n\nOn July 2, 1990, Bingham again wrote to Kassaye:\n\n          I regret  that you  will not  vacate your\n          office  as  I  requested.    Although the\n          office  is  needed  badly to  accommodate\n          several moves, I  will honor your request\n          to remain until July 31.\n\n          Although  I  recognize   that  you   have\n          negative  feelings   about  being  denied\n          tenure, your failure to  accommodate this\n          move inconveniences only persons who were\n\n                             -4-\n\n          not   even   Bryant  employees   when  it\n          happened.\n\nKassaye retained access to  his office until the last  day of\n\nhis employment, July 31, 1990.\n\n          On  November 19,  1990, Kassaye  filed a  charge of\n\ndiscrimination with  the  Rhode Island  Commission for  Human\n\nRights (\"RICHR\"), alleging that Bryant  College discriminated\n\nagainst  him on  the basis  of his  race, color  and national\n\norigin.  Kassaye  is automatically deemed  to have filed  the\n\nsame charge with the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(\"EEOC\") on January 18,  1991, sixty days after he  filed the\n\nRICHR charge.  See 29 C.F.R.   1601.13(b).\n                  \n\n          The RICHR and the EEOC issued  right-to-sue letters\n\nin  July and  October 1991,  respectively, and  Kassaye filed\n\nthis civil action for  injunctive and monetary relief  in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Rhode Island\n\non  October 16,  1991.   The  complaint  alleged that  Bryant\n\nCollege  and college  administrators  William  E.  Trueheart,\n\nJames W.  Robinson, Michael  B. Patterson, and  Frank Bingham\n\nviolated  section 703(a)(1) of Title VII  of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C.   2000e-2(a)(1) \"by denying his tenure\n\nand thereby terminating his  employment\" because of his race,\n\ncolor and national origin.   The complaint also alleged  that\n\n                             -5-\n\nthe  tenure  denial  constituted,  under  Rhode  Island  law,\n\ntortious conduct and breach of contract.1\n\n          The  district court  granted  summary judgment  for\n\ndefendants on the Title VII claims on the ground that Kassaye\n\ndid  not file  his  charge of  discrimination  with the  EEOC\n\nwithin  the 300-day limitations period set out in 42 U.S.C.  \n\n2000e-5(e).      Lacking   any  other   basis   for   federal\n\njurisdiction, the district court dismissed  the pendant state\n\nlaw  claims.  See  Newman v. Burgin,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559503\"><a href=\"/opinion/559503/anny-newman-v-diana-burgin/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 963 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir. 1991). \n\n          On  appeal, Kassaye  disputes the  district court's\n\nconclusion  that his  EEOC  charge was  untimely  filed.   42\n\nU.S.C.     2000e-5(e)  defines  the  limitations  period  for\n\ncharges of unlawful employment practices:\n\n               A charge under this section shall be\n          filed [with the EEOC] within  one hundred\n          and   eighty   days  after   the  alleged\n          unlawful  employment   practice  occurred\n          . . . ,  except  that  in  a  case  of an\n          unlawful employment practice with respect\n          to   which   the  person   aggrieved  has\n          initially  instituted proceedings  with a\n          State or local  agency with authority  to\n          grant or  seek relief from  such practice\n          . . . , such charge shall  be filed by or\n          on  behalf of the person aggrieved within\n\n                    \n\n1.   The complaint was amended once to add a copy of the EEOC\nright-to-sue letter.   The  amended complaint is  referred to\nherein as \"the complaint.\"\n\n                             -6-\n\n          three  hundred  days  after  the  alleged\n          unlawfulemployment\n                           practiceoccurred. . . .2\n\nIt is undisputed that  the 300-day limitations period applied\n\nhere,3  and that the filing date of Kassaye's charge for EEOC\n\npurposes  was January 18, 1991.   It is  also undisputed that\n\nKassaye received actual notice  of the tenure denial,  at the\n\nlatest,  by January 20,  1990.4  Thus,  Kassaye's EEOC charge\n\nwas timely only if \"the alleged unlawful employment practice\"\n\n                    \n\n2.   This portion of 42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(e) is now designated\nas paragraph (1).  See Civil  Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No.\n                      \n102-166, Title I,   112, 105 Stat. 1071, 1078-79 (1991).  The\nredesignation of this text and the  addition of new paragraph\n(2), concerning seniority systems,  do not affect the outcome\nof appellant's case.\n\n3.   All parties assume    as the EEOC itself has declared   \nthat Rhode Island is  a deferral state for purposes  of Title\nVII, and  thus that the 300-day period  applies here.  See 29\n                                                          \nC.F.R.     1601.70(a), 1601.74(a).   A deferral state  is one\nwith an \"agency with  authority to grant or seek  relief from\nsuch [unlawful employment] practice[s].\"   42 U.S.C.   2000e-\n5(e).

These  acts,\n\nsaid  to constitute harassment of Kassaye on the basis of his\n\nrace, color  and national  origin, included assigning  him to\n\nteach  a  class he  did not  wish  to teach,  relying  on the\n\nevaluations  of white  peers  and students  in making  tenure\n\n                    \n\ndiscrimination, in  both the  charge form and  his complaint,\nfocused  almost  exclusively on  the  details  of the  tenure\ndenial.   Only one sentence on his discrimination charge form\nmentioned  the request  that  he vacate  his  office a  month\nearly.  The complaint did  not even allege that the June  8th\nincident occurred, but merely  referred to the discrimination\ncharge  form    which itself only mentioned the memo    as an\nexhibit.\n\n                             -9-\n\ndecisions, denying him tenure,  and asking him to  vacate his\n\noffice.
