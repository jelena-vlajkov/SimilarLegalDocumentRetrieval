Claimant Saul Baez Hernandez  appeals\n                    \n\nfrom the  district court  judgment affirming the  decision of\n\nthe Secretary of  Health and Human Services  that claimant is\n\nnot entitled to Social Security disability benefits.\n\n                    I.  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n                                         \n\n          Claimant filed  an application for  Social Security\n\ndisability benefits on March  10, 1986.  He alleged  an onset\n\ndate of  January 25, 1985 when  he hurt his back  at work; he\n\nlisted  as  his  impairments  back  and  nervous  conditions.\n\nClaimant  returned  to  work  on  November  16,  1988.    His\n\napplication was  denied by an administrative  law judge (ALJ)\n\nin  July 1987  and  the Appeals  Council rejected  claimant's\n\nrequest  for review.    While the  case  was pending  in  the\n\nfederal  district court,  the Secretary  of Health  and Human\n\nServices requested  a remand.   Pursuant to this  remand, the\n\nAppeals Council ordered  that a second  hearing be held  with\n\nthe testimony of a  vocational expert (VE).  At  the hearing,\n\nheld on November  16, 1988,  it appears that  no such  expert\n\ntestified.  A different ALJ determined  that claimant was not\n\ndisabled.   The Appeals  Council, on March  20, 1989, ordered\n\nyet   another   hearing;   it  determined   that   claimant's\n\nlimitations significantly affected his ability to perform the\n\nfull range of light and sedentary work.  It ordered that a VE\n\n                             -2-\n\ntestify  as  to the  existence  of jobs  that  claimant could\n\nperform.\n\n          On June 22, 1989,  after holding the third hearing,\n\nat which a  VE testified,  the ALJ who  first had  considered\n\nclaimant's  application  determined  that  claimant  was  not\n\ndisabled.    He  found  that claimant  suffered  from  severe\n\nlumbosacral strain.  As  for claimant's complaints of totally\n\ndisabling pain, the ALJ concluded that while credible when he\n\nfirst injured his back,  there was no convincing evidence  of\n\ncontinuing  severe   pain.    Thus,  the   ALJ  credited  the\n\nallegations  of   pain  to  the  extent   that  claimant  was\n\nprohibited from engaging  in heavy work.   He therefore could\n\nnot perform  his past work as a truck driver and delivery man\n\nwhich involved the carrying of heavy appliances.\n\n          However,  according to  the ALJ,  claimant retained\n\nthe capacity for the full range of light work limited only by\n\nhis need to alternate positions; claimant further was limited\n\nbecause  he could  bend only  occasionally and could  not use\n\nrepetitive foot movements.   The ALJ found that  claimant did\n\nnot have  any nonexertional impairments.   Given his acquired\n\nwork  skills such  as  following  instructions and  counting,\n\nclaimant  was  able to  perform semi-skilled  work activities\n\nsuch  as a stock  person in a  warehouse -- the  job to which\n\nclaimant had returned in November 1988.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          The  Appeals Council,  upon claimant's  request for\n\nreview,  affirmed the decision  of the ALJ  that claimant was\n\nnot entitled to disability benefits.   The Council did modify\n\nthe  ALJ's decision in one respect by finding the presence of\n\na nonexertional impairment.  However, this impairment did not\n\nsignificantly  limit claimant's  ability  to do  work-related\n\nactivity.   On appeal  to the  district court, a  magistrate-\n\njudge  recommended that  the matter  be remanded  for further\n\nadministrative proceedings.   Nonetheless, the district court\n\njudge affirmed the Secretary's decision.  This appeal ensued.\n\n           II.  DISCUSSION OF THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE\n                                                  \n\n          A.  Back Impairment\n                             \n\n          The evidence  concerning the  nature and  extent of\n\nclaimant's  back impairment  is conflicting.   In  total, six\n\nconsultative  evaluations  were  conducted between  1985  and\n\n1988.  In  addition, claimant received treatment at the State\n\nInsurance Fund  (SIF) from  January 1985 through  April 1988.\n\nSee Exhibits 17 and 36.  According to SIF records, a C-T Scan\n   \n\nperformed in August  1985 revealed  a narrowing  of the  disc\n\nspace  at L5-S1 with  a disc  herniation to  the right  and a\n\nsmall  lateral  disc herniation  to the  left  at L4-L5.   In\n\nAugust 1985,  a physiatrist at the SIF  examined claimant and\n\nfound that claimant could not  squat, had pain upon palpation\n\nand upon flexion and  lateral movement of the trunk.   During\n\n1985, claimant  continued with  these symptoms.   However, an\n\n                             -4-\n\nSIF physician in September of 1985 noted that claimant's pain\n\nappeared only  upon exercise or prolonged  periods of sitting\n\nor standing.  At this  examination, he found no radiculopathy\n\nand that claimant's gait was normal.\n\n          In March  1986, a  follow-up report indicated  that\n\nclaimant evinced  little interest  in engaging  in vocational\n\nrehabilitation.    In  June   1986,  a  vocational  evaluator\n\nreported that  despite  claimant's complaints  of  testicular\n\npain, headaches and pain  in his fingers, neck, low  back and\n\nlegs,  claimant  was  able  to  lift  up  to  twenty  pounds.\n\nAlthough he  had  trouble  bending  forward  and  experienced\n\ndifficulties kneeling  and squatting, he could  sit and stand\n\nfor  sufficient lengths  of  time so  that  with a  job  that\n\nallowed him to change position,  he could perform light work.\n\nThus,  claimant  was noted  as having  \"great\" rehabilitative\n\npotential.\n\n          Turning to the consultative medical evaluations, we\n\nfind  it necessary  for  the disposition  of  this appeal  to\n\nreview only those upon  which the VE based his opinions as to\n\nappellant's physical abilities.  In August 1988, an internist\n\nfound  no swelling,  no muscle  atrophy and  normal reflexes.\n\nSee Exhibit  41.  There was diminished  pinprick sensation in\n   \n\nclaimant's left leg.  The  diagnosis was fibromyositis of the\n\nlumbosacral spine  with spasms and discogenic  disease at L5-\n\nS1.   The residual  functional capacity (RFC)  form indicated\n\n                             -5-\n\nthat  claimant could lift a maximum of 50 pounds on occasion,\n\ncould stand or walk for four to six hours at a time and could\n\nsit  for up  to  four hours  so long  as  he could  alternate\n\npositions.   Claimant could frequently climb  and balance and\n\ncould occasionally stoop, kneel, crawl and crouch.\n\n          A  neurologist, also  examining claimant  in August\n\n1988,  found claimant  with  a normal  spine, full  strength,\n\nnormal tone and no evidence of atrophy or radiculopathy.  See\n                                                             \n\nExhibit  42.    Claimant  had  limited  trunk  movements  and\n\nalthough he showed  signs of  sensory deficit,  they did  not\n\nfollow  any anatomical  distribution.   An  X-ray revealed  a\n\nnarrowing  of the  L5-S1 disc  space and  lumbar spasm.   The\n\ndiagnosis  was chronic back pain.  In the RFC evaluation, the\n\nneurologist determined that claimant  could lift a maximum of\n\n50 pounds.   He could stand and  walk without any limits, but\n\ncould  sit for an uninterrupted  time for only  three to four\n\nhours in a  work day.   Claimant had  no limits in  kneeling,\n\ncrouching, crawling,  climbing or balancing.   He was limited\n\nin his ability to push or pull.\n\n          In  contrast  to the  above  is  the  report of  an\n\nevaluation performed  by a  neurologist on January  28, 1987.\n\nSee Exhibit 20.   This examiner found lumbar dextroscoliosis,\n   \n\nmarked lumbosacral paravertebral muscle spasm  and tenderness\n\nto palpation.  Claimant had limited range of motion and could\n\nbend forward only 30 degrees.  The diagnoses were as follows:\n\n                             -6-\n\n(1) herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) at  L4-L5 and L5-S1; (2)\n\nbilateral intractable S1 radiculopathies; (3) severe, chronic\n\nlumbosacral  myositis and  myofascial  pain; and  (4)  lumbar\n\nfacet  axial   injury  and  pain  syndrome.     The  report's\n\nconclusions  were that claimant's  musculoskeletal and spinal\n\nconditions, along with nerve root involvement, contributed to\n\n\"severe  functional spinal limitation in  all of the range of\n\nlumbar  movements.\"    As  a result,  claimant's  ability  to\n\nmaintain a  fixed position for  a substantial period  of time\n\nwas   limited;  further,   claimant's   constant   pain   was\n\nexacerbated  by physical  exertion.   Thus, he  was precluded\n\nfrom engaging  in \"any type of  gainful activity whatsoever.\"\n\nAccording to  this doctor,  claimant  was in  \"dire need\"  of\n\ntreatment.\n\n          At  the last  hearing,  the ALJ  asked  the VE  his\n\nopinion of what  type of work claimant could perform.  The VE\n\nresponded  that if one  used only Exhibit  20, claimant would\n\nnot be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity due\n\nto  his functional limits and severe pain.  However, based on\n\nthe RFC forms completed by the other two examiners, claimant,\n\nalthough  precluded from  heavy work  such as  his last  job,\n\ncould perform moderate work.  The VE reached this  conclusion\n\neven  taking  into  account  claimant's  pain  and  decreased\n\nabilities in sitting, standing or walking for long periods of\n\ntime.\n\n                             -7-\n\n          Claimant  argues that  the ALJ  did not  credit his\n\ncomplaints of pain.  We  do not agree.  The VE  in describing\n\nclaimant   as  being   able  to   engage  in   moderate  work\n\nspecifically referred  to pain  as a component  of claimant's\n\nprofile.  The  ALJ went  further than the  VE, deciding  that\n\nclaimant  could  perform  only  light  work  where  he  could\n\nalternate  positions.1  This finding was based in part on the\n\nfact  that claimant's pain  as well  as his  other conditions\n\nrequired this kind of flexibility.  Although the reports were\n\nconflicting  as  to  whether  claimant's  pain  was   totally\n\ndisabling, such conflicts are for the ALJ, not the courts, to\n\nresolve.   See  Rodriguez v.  Secretary of  Health and  Human\n                                                             \n\nServices, 647 F.2d 218, 222  (1st Cir. 1981).  Thus,  we find\n        \n\nthat  there was  substantial  evidence to  support the  ALJ's\n\nconclusion that  claimant could perform the  demands of light\n\nwork.\n\n          2.  Mental Impairment\n                               \n\n          Whether   claimant's    emotional   impairment   is\n\ndisabling  is  a  closer  question.   He  began  experiencing\n\nemotional  problems after he  injured his back.   He received\n\ntreatment for  these problems  at the Carolina  Mental Health\n\nCenter from  March 1986 through February 1988.   See Exhibits\n                                                    \n\n                    \n\n1.  For some  reason, claimant argues  that the ALJ  erred by\nrelying on  the  grid and  that  the testimony  of a  VE  was\nrequired.  It appears that claimant bases this  contention on\nthe first decision rendered  by the ALJ in July  1987, rather\n         \nthan the most recent decision of June 1989.\n\n                             -8-\n\n18 and 37.   At his initial evaluation, claimant  stated that\n\nhe  had trouble sleeping, was irritable, lost his temper with\n\nhis   children,  experienced   headaches   and  some   visual\n\nhallucinations at night.  The diagnosis, at this time, was an\n\nadjustment disorder with depression;  the prognosis was  good\n\nwith  out-patient  counseling   recommended.    Clinic  notes\n\nindicate   that  during   1986,   claimant   evinced   little\n\ncooperation with treatment; he stated that he  was there only\n\nfor the  purpose of obtaining  medication to help  him sleep.\n\nHis  case  was terminated  in January  1987, no  real changes\n\nhaving occurred.  However, in December 1987, claimant was re-\n\nadmitted to the out-patient program with the same complaints.\n\nAt   this  time,  claimant  was  cooperative,  goal-directed,\n\nrelevant  and  his thought  processes  were  intact.   Again,\n\nlittle  gain appears to have been made with treatment and the\n\nrecord reflects that his last visit was in February 1988.\n\n          Claimant underwent four psychiatric  evaluations --\n\ntwo in 1986  and two in 1987.  All  the examiners agreed that\n\nclaimant was  coherent, logical, relevant and  oriented.  See\n                                                             \n\nExhibits   15,  17,  38  and  40.    Despite  his  subjective\n\ncomplaints of hallucinations, all  four examiners also agreed\n\nthat his thought  processes were intact  with no evidence  of\n\npsychotic perceptions.    Although two  examiners noted  some\n\nimpairment with recent and  immediate memory, see Exhibits 17\n                                                 \n\nand 40,  this was not  perceived as  a major problem  and all\n\n                             -9-\n\nfour  agreed  that claimant's  judgment  was,  at a  minimum,\n\nadequate.  Similarly, all four examiners agreed that claimant\n\nwas  anxious  and  distracted,  with  three  observing   that\n\nclaimant  appeared depressed.   See Exhibits  15, 38  and 40.\n                                   \n\nThe  most   common  diagnosis   was  depression  related   to\n\nclaimant's accident.\n\n          The  evaluators  differed  as   to  the  effect  of\n\nclaimant's  mental condition  or his  ability to  function at\n\nwork.   A psychologist who  tested claimant for  the SIF, see\n                                                             \n\nExhibit 17, determined that  claimant had a borderline  IQ of\n\n76.  His vocational test scores revealed a strong interest in\n\nmanual  activities.    Despite   the  presence  of  \"mild  to\n\nmoderate\"  anxiety  which affected  claimant's concentration,\n\nthe psychologist  believed that this condition  was treatable\n\non  an  out-patient   counseling  basis.    Claimant's   work\n\nprognosis was \"very much acceptable\" and \"his emotional state\n\nand  his  intellectual  capacities\"  were  \"appropriate\"  for\n\nvocational rehabilitation.\n\n          However, the  one examiner  who completed a  mental\n\nRFC assessment, see Exhibit 40, rated claimant's abilities to\n                   \n\nfunction in the following areas as \"poor or none\" (defined on\n\nthe  RFC form  as \"[n]o  useful ability  to function\"):   (1)\n\nfollowing work rules; (2) relating to co-workers; (3) dealing\n\nwith the public; (4) interacting with supervisors; (5) coping\n\nwith   work  stresses;  (6)  maintaining  concentration;  (7)\n\n                             -10-\n\nhandling detailed or  complex job instructions; (8)  behaving\n\nin  an  emotionally  stable  manner;  and  (9)  demonstrating\n\nreliability.    His  abilities  to  use  judgment,   function\n\nindependently  and  relate predictably  in  social situations\n\nwere  \"fair\"  --  defined  as  \"seriously  limited,  but  not\n\nprecluded.\"   Claimant had good (\"limited  but satisfactory\")\n\nabilities  in the  areas  of  understanding, remembering  and\n\ncarryingout\n          simpleinstructions\n                           andinmaintaining\n                                          personalappearance.\n\n          Two non-examining doctors completed RFC assessments\n\nin  1986.  See Exhibit 14.   They agreed that claimant had no\n                                                             \n\nsignificant  limits  in   the  following  activities:     (1)\n\nremembering locations and work procedures; (2) understanding,\n\nremembering   and  carrying   out  very   short  and   simple\n\ninstructions;  (3) making simple  work-related decisions; (4)\n\nasking  simple  questions;  (5)  requesting  assistance;  (6)\n\nacting in  a socially appropriate manner;  and (7) responding\n\nappropriately to changes in the work place.  Both also viewed\n\nclaimant  as  being moderately  limited  in  his capacity  to\n\nmaintain  a normal  work  week without  interruptions due  to\n\npsychological symptoms, to accept  criticism and to get along\n\nwith co-workers.  These same  evaluators, on the \"B\" criteria\n\nof  the  Psychiatric  Review  Technique   (PRT)  Form,  rated\n\nclaimant as  slightly limited in daily  living activities and\n\nmoderately  limited in  social  functioning; claimant  seldom\n\n                             -11-\n\nexperienced  problems  with   concentration  and  never   had\n\nepisodes of deterioration at work or in work-like settings.\n\n          In   1988,   two   non-examining  physicians   also\n\ncompleted PRT forms.  They opined that although claimant  was\n\nanxious  and  depressed,  his  emotional  condition  was  not\n\nsevere.  See Exhibit  35.  As for the \"B\"  criteria, claimant\n            \n\nhad   slight  limitations   in   daily   living  and   social\n\nfunctioning, seldom experienced  problems with  concentration\n\nand never had problems with deterioration at work or in work-\n\nlike settings.\n\n          The ALJ also questioned the VE concerning the above\n\nevidence.   Again, the VE  pointed out that  the evidence was\n\nconflicting  and  the  conclusions   as  to  claimant's  work\n\nabilities  were   dependent  on  what  medical   reports  one\n\nutilized.   Based on the  psychiatrist's report  and the  RFC\n\nevaluation, claimant  would  not  be able  to  work  at  all.\n\nHowever, the  other  reports, according  to the  VE, did  not\n\nsupport such a finding of total disability.\n\n          Although we do not agree with the ALJ that claimant\n\ndid  not have any  emotional impairment and  even hesitate to\n                 \n\nfind,  as  did  the  Appeals  Council,  that  while  such  an\n\nimpairment  did  exist,  it  had  no  significant  effect  on\n\nclaimant, we  believe that  there is substantial  evidence to\n\nsupport the  conclusion that claimant was  not precluded from\n\nwork.   We first note, however, that the findings of moderate\n\n                             -12-\n\nlimitations in accommodating the demands of a work setting --\n\ni.e., regular  attendance and  the completion of  a work-week\n    \n\nwithout interruption  -- can erode the  occupational base, at\n\nleast marginally.  See Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human\n                                                             \n\nServices, 890  F.2d 520, 527  (1st Cir. 1989).   Nonetheless,\n        \n\ngiven  the presence  of the  RFC assessments  indicating that\n\nclaimant had  the ability  to follow simple  instructions and\n\nthat  his  attention and  concentration  were  only minimally\n\naffected, along  with  the RFC  assessments  that  claimant's\n\nemotional impairment was not  severe, we cannot say  that the\n\nVE's conclusion that claimant could work as a warehouse stock\n\nperson was without record support.  Although the record could\n\nsupport  a  different  conclusion, we  again  emphasize  that\n\nconflicts in the record  are for the Secretary.   See Irlanda\n                                                             \n\nOrtiz v.

PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant filed an application for Social Security disability benefits on March 10, 1986.  He alleged an onset date of January 25, 1985 when he hurt his back at work;  he listed as his impairments back and nervous conditions.  Claimant returned to work on November 16, 1988.  His application was denied by an administrative law judge (ALJ) in July 1987 and the Appeals Council rejected claimant's request for review.  While the case was pending in the federal district court, the Secretary of Health and Human Services requested a remand.  Pursuant to this remand, the Appeals Council ordered that a second hearing be held with the testimony of a vocational expert (VE).  At the hearing, held on November 16, 1988, it appears that no such expert testified.  A different ALJ determined that claimant was not disabled.  The Appeals Council, on March 20, 1989, ordered yet another hearing;  it determined that claimant's limitations significantly affected his ability to perform the full range of light and sedentary work.  It ordered that a VE testify as to the existence of jobs that claimant could perform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, 1989, after holding the third hearing, at which a VE testified, the ALJ who first had considered claimant's application determined that claimant was not disabled.  He found that claimant suffered from severe lumbosacral strain.  As for claimant's complaints of totally disabling pain, the ALJ concluded that while credible when he first injured his back, there was no convincing evidence of continuing severe pain.  Thus, the ALJ credited the allegations of pain to the extent that claimant was prohibited from engaging in heavy work.  He therefore could not perform his past work as a truck driver and delivery man which involved the carrying of heavy appliances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, according to the ALJ, claimant retained the capacity for the full range of light work limited only by his need to alternate positions;  claimant further was limited because he could bend only occasionally and could not use repetitive foot movements.  The ALJ found that claimant did not have any nonexertional impairments.  Given his acquired work skills such as following instructions and counting, claimant was able to perform semi-skilled work activities such as a stock person in a warehouse-the job to which claimant had returned in November 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appeals Council, upon claimant's request for review, affirmed the decision of the ALJ that claimant was not entitled to disability benefits.  The Council did modify the ALJ's decision in one respect by finding the presence of a nonexertional impairment.  However, this impairment did not significantly limit claimant's ability to do work-related activity.  On appeal to the district court, a magistrate-judge recommended that the matter be remanded for further administrative proceedings.  Nonetheless, the district court judge affirmed the Secretary's decision.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION OF THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE</p>\n    <p>A. Back Impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence concerning the nature and extent of claimant's back impairment is conflicting.  In total, six consultative evaluations were conducted between 1985 and 1988.  In addition, claimant received treatment at the State Insurance Fund (SIF) from January 1985 through April 1988.  See Exhibits 17 and 36.  According to SIF records, a C-T Scan performed in August 1985 revealed a narrowing of the disc space at L5-S1 with a disc herniation to the right and a small lateral disc herniation to the left at L4-L5. In August 1985, a physiatrist at the SIF examined claimant and found that claimant could not squat, had pain upon palpation and upon flexion and lateral movement of the trunk.  During 1985, claimant continued with these symptoms.  However, an SIF physician in September of 1985 noted that claimant's pain appeared only upon exercise or prolonged periods of sitting or standing.  At this examination, he found no radiculopathy and that claimant's gait was normal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1986, a follow-up report indicated that claimant evinced little interest in engaging in vocational rehabilitation.  In June 1986, a vocational evaluator reported that despite claimant's complaints of testicular pain, headaches and pain in his fingers, neck, low back and legs, claimant was able to lift up to twenty pounds.  Although he had trouble bending forward and experienced difficulties kneeling and squatting, he could sit and stand for sufficient lengths of time so that with a job that allowed him to change position, he could perform light work.  Thus, claimant was noted as having \"great\" rehabilitative potential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the consultative medical evaluations, we find it necessary for the disposition of this appeal to review only those upon which the VE based his opinions as to appellant's physical abilities.  In August 1988, an internist found no swelling, no muscle atrophy and normal reflexes.  See Exhibit 41.  There was diminished pinprick sensation in claimant's left leg.  The diagnosis was fibromyositis of the lumbosacral spine with spasms and discogenic disease at L5-S1. The residual functional capacity (RFC) form indicated that claimant could lift a maximum of 50 pounds on occasion, could stand or walk for four to six hours at a time and could sit for up to four hours so long as he could alternate positions.  Claimant could frequently climb and balance and could occasionally stoop, kneel, crawl and crouch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A neurologist, also examining claimant in August 1988, found claimant with a normal spine, full strength, normal tone and no evidence of atrophy or radiculopathy.  See Exhibit 42.  Claimant had limited trunk movements and although he showed signs of sensory deficit, they did not follow any anatomical distribution.  An X-ray revealed a narrowing of the L5-S1 disc space and lumbar spasm.  The diagnosis was chronic back pain.  In the RFC evaluation, the neurologist determined that claimant could lift a maximum of 50 pounds.  He could stand and walk without any limits, but could sit for an uninterrupted time for only three to four hours in a work day.  Claimant had no limits in kneeling, crouching, crawling, climbing or balancing.  He was limited in his ability to push or pull.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the above is the report of an evaluation performed by a neurologist on January 28, 1987.  See Exhibit 20.  This examiner found lumbar dextroscoliosis, marked lumbosacral paravertebral muscle spasm and tenderness to palpation.  Claimant had limited range of motion and could bend forward only 30 degrees.  The diagnoses were as follows:  (1) herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) at L4-L5 and L5-S1;  (2) bilateral intractable S1 radiculopathies;  (3) severe, chronic lumbosacral myositis and myofascial pain;  and (4) lumbar facet axial injury and pain syndrome.  The report's conclusions were that claimant's musculoskeletal and spinal conditions, along with nerve root involvement, contributed to \"severe functional spinal limitation in all of the range of lumbar movements.\"  As a result, claimant's ability to maintain a fixed position for a substantial period of time was limited;  further, claimant's constant pain was exacerbated by physical exertion.  Thus, he was precluded from engaging in \"any type of gainful activity whatsoever.\"  According to this doctor, claimant was in \"dire need\" of treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the last hearing, the ALJ asked the VE his opinion of what type of work claimant could perform.  The VE responded that if one used only Exhibit 20, claimant would not be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity due to his functional limits and severe pain.  However, based on the RFC forms completed by the other two examiners, claimant, although precluded from heavy work such as his last job, could perform moderate work.  The VE reached this conclusion even taking into account claimant's pain and decreased abilities in sitting, standing or walking for long periods of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant argues that the ALJ did not credit his complaints of pain.  We do not agree.  The VE in describing claimant as being able to engage in moderate work specifically referred to pain as a component of claimant's profile.  The ALJ went further than the VE, deciding that claimant could perform only light work where he could alternate positions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This finding was based in part on the fact that claimant's pain as well as his other conditions required this kind of flexibility.  Although the reports were conflicting as to whether claimant's pain was totally disabling, such conflicts are for the ALJ, not the courts, to resolve.   See Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).  Thus, we find that there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ's conclusion that claimant could perform the demands of light work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Mental Impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether claimant's emotional impairment is disabling is a closer question.  He began experiencing emotional problems after he injured his back.  He received treatment for these problems at the Carolina Mental Health Center from March 1986 through February 1988.  See Exhibits 18 and 37.  At his initial evaluation, claimant stated that he had trouble sleeping, was irritable, lost his temper with his children, experienced headaches and some visual hallucinations at night.  The diagnosis, at this time, was an adjustment disorder with depression;  the prognosis was good with out-patient counseling recommended.  Clinic notes indicate that during 1986, claimant evinced little cooperation with treatment;  he stated that he was there only for the purpose of obtaining medication to help him sleep.  His case was terminated in January 1987, no real changes having occurred.  However, in December 1987, claimant was re-admitted to the out-patient program with the same complaints.  At this time, claimant was cooperative, goal-directed, relevant and his thought processes were intact.  Again, little gain appears to have been made with treatment and the record reflects that his last visit was in February 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant underwent four psychiatric evaluations-two in 1986 and two in 1987.  All the examiners agreed that claimant was coherent, logical, relevant and oriented.  See Exhibits 15, 17, 38 and 40.  Despite his subjective complaints of hallucinations, all four examiners also agreed that his thought processes were intact with no evidence of psychotic perceptions.  Although two examiners noted some impairment with recent and immediate memory, see Exhibits 17 and 40, this was not perceived as a major problem and all four agreed that claimant's judgment was, at a minimum, adequate.  Similarly, all four examiners agreed that claimant was anxious and distracted, with three observing that claimant appeared depressed.  See Exhibits 15, 38 and 40.  The most common diagnosis was depression related to claimant's accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evaluators differed as to the effect of claimant's mental condition or his ability to function at work.  A psychologist who tested claimant for the SIF, see Exhibit 17, determined that claimant had a borderline IQ of 76.  His vocational test scores revealed a strong interest in manual activities.  Despite the presence of \"mild to moderate\" anxiety which affected claimant's concentration, the psychologist believed that this condition was treatable on an out-patient counseling basis.  Claimant's work prognosis was \"very much acceptable\" and \"his emotional state and his intellectual capacities\" were \"appropriate\" for vocational rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the one examiner who completed a mental RFC assessment, see Exhibit 40, rated claimant's abilities to function in the following areas as \"poor or none\" (defined on the RFC form as \"[n]o useful ability to function\"):  (1) following work rules; (2) relating to co-workers;  (3) dealing with the public;  (4) interacting with supervisors;  (5) coping with work stresses;  (6) maintaining concentration;  (7) handling detailed or complex job instructions;  (8) behaving in an emotionally stable manner;  and (9) demonstrating reliability.  His abilities to use judgment, function independently and relate predictably in social situations were \"fair\"-defined as \"seriously limited, but not precluded.\"  Claimant had good (\"limited but satisfactory\") abilities in the areas of understanding, remembering and carrying out simple instructions and in maintaining personal appearance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two non-examining doctors completed RFC assessments in 1986.  See Exhibit 14.  They agreed that claimant had no significant limits in the following activities:  (1) remembering locations and work procedures;  (2) understanding, remembering and carrying out very short and simple instructions;  (3) making simple work-related decisions;  (4) asking simple questions;  (5) requesting assistance;  (6) acting in a socially appropriate manner; and (7) responding appropriately to changes in the work place.  Both also viewed claimant as being moderately limited in his capacity to maintain a normal work week without interruptions due to psychological symptoms, to accept criticism and to get along with co-workers.  These same evaluators, on the \"B\" criteria of the Psychiatric Review Technique (PRT) Form, rated claimant as slightly limited in daily living activities and moderately limited in social functioning;  claimant seldom experienced problems with concentration and never had episodes of deterioration at work or in work-like settings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, two non-examining physicians also completed PRT forms.  They opined that although claimant was anxious and depressed, his emotional condition was not severe.  See Exhibit 35.  As for the \"B\" criteria, claimant had slight limitations in daily living and social functioning, seldom experienced problems with concentration and never had problems with deterioration at work or in work-like settings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ also questioned the VE concerning the above evidence.  Again, the VE pointed out that the evidence was conflicting and the conclusions as to claimant's work abilities were dependent on what medical reports one utilized.  Based on the psychiatrist's report and the RFC evaluation, claimant would not be able to work at all.  However, the other reports, according to the VE, did not support such a finding of total disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we do not agree with the ALJ that claimant did not have any emotional impairment and even hesitate to find, as did the Appeals Council, that while such an impairment did exist, it had no significant effect on claimant, we believe that there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion that claimant was not precluded from work.  We first note, however, that the findings of moderate limitations in accommodating the demands of a work setting-i.e., regular attendance and the completion of a work-week without interruption-can erode the occupational base, at least marginally.   See Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 890 F.2d 520, 527 (1st Cir. 1989).  Nonetheless, given the presence of the RFC assessments indicating that claimant had the ability to follow simple instructions and that his attention and concentration were only minimally affected, along with the RFC assessments that claimant's emotional impairment was not severe, we cannot say that the VE's conclusion that claimant could work as a warehouse stock person was without record support.  Although the record could support a different conclusion, we again emphasize that conflicts in the record are for the Secretary.   See Irlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 955 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For some reason, claimant argues that the ALJ erred by relying on the grid and that the testimony of a VE was required.

His application was denied by an administrative law judge (ALJ) in July 1987 and the Appeals Council rejected claimant's request for review.  While the case was pending in the federal district court, the Secretary of Health and Human Services requested a remand.  Pursuant to this remand, the Appeals Council ordered that a second hearing be held with the testimony of a vocational expert (VE).

Back Impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence concerning the nature and extent of claimant's back impairment is conflicting.  In total, six consultative evaluations were conducted between 1985 and 1988.  In addition, claimant received treatment at the State Insurance Fund (SIF) from January 1985 through April 1988.  See Exhibits 17 and 36.

At this examination, he found no radiculopathy and that claimant's gait was normal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1986, a follow-up report indicated that claimant evinced little interest in engaging in vocational rehabilitation.  In June 1986, a vocational evaluator reported that despite claimant's complaints of testicular pain, headaches and pain in his fingers, neck, low back and legs, claimant was able to lift up to twenty pounds.  Although he had trouble bending forward and experienced difficulties kneeling and squatting, he could sit and stand for sufficient lengths of time so that with a job that allowed him to change position, he could perform light work.  Thus, claimant was noted as having \"great\" rehabilitative potential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the consultative medical evaluations, we find it necessary for the disposition of this appeal to review only those upon which the VE based his opinions as to appellant's physical abilities.  In August 1988, an internist found no swelling, no muscle atrophy and normal reflexes.  See Exhibit 41.  There was diminished pinprick sensation in claimant's left leg.  The diagnosis was fibromyositis of the lumbosacral spine with spasms and discogenic disease at L5-S1. The residual functional capacity (RFC) form indicated that claimant could lift a maximum of 50 pounds on occasion, could stand or walk for four to six hours at a time and could sit for up to four hours so long as he could alternate positions.  Claimant could frequently climb and balance and could occasionally stoop, kneel, crawl and crouch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A neurologist, also examining claimant in August 1988, found claimant with a normal spine, full strength, normal tone and no evidence of atrophy or radiculopathy.  See Exhibit 42.  Claimant had limited trunk movements and although he showed signs of sensory deficit, they did not follow any anatomical distribution.  An X-ray revealed a narrowing of the L5-S1 disc space and lumbar spasm.  The diagnosis was chronic back pain.  In the RFC evaluation, the neurologist determined that claimant could lift a maximum of 50 pounds.  He could stand and walk without any limits, but could sit for an uninterrupted time for only three to four hours in a work day.  Claimant had no limits in kneeling, crouching, crawling, climbing or balancing.  He was limited in his ability to push or pull.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the above is the report of an evaluation performed by a neurologist on January 28, 1987.  See Exhibit 20.  This examiner found lumbar dextroscoliosis, marked lumbosacral paravertebral muscle spasm and tenderness to palpation.  Claimant had limited range of motion and could bend forward only 30 degrees.  The diagnoses were as follows:  (1) herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) at L4-L5 and L5-S1;  (2) bilateral intractable S1 radiculopathies;  (3) severe, chronic lumbosacral myositis and myofascial pain;  and (4) lumbar facet axial injury and pain syndrome.  The report's conclusions were that claimant's musculoskeletal and spinal conditions, along with nerve root involvement, contributed to \"severe functional spinal limitation in all of the range of lumbar movements.\"  As a result, claimant's ability to maintain a fixed position for a substantial period of time was limited;  further, claimant's constant pain was exacerbated by physical exertion.  Thus, he was precluded from engaging in \"any type of gainful activity whatsoever.\"  According to this doctor, claimant was in \"dire need\" of treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the last hearing, the ALJ asked the VE his opinion of what type of work claimant could perform.  The VE responded that if one used only Exhibit 20, claimant would not be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity due to his functional limits and severe pain.  However, based on the RFC forms completed by the other two examiners, claimant, although precluded from heavy work such as his last job, could perform moderate work.  The VE reached this conclusion even taking into account claimant's pain and decreased abilities in sitting, standing or walking for long periods of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant argues that the ALJ did not credit his complaints of pain.  We do not agree.  The VE in describing claimant as being able to engage in moderate work specifically referred to pain as a component of claimant's profile.  The ALJ went further than the VE, deciding that claimant could perform only light work where he could alternate positions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This finding was based in part on the fact that claimant's pain as well as his other conditions required this kind of flexibility.  Although the reports were conflicting as to whether claimant's pain was totally disabling, such conflicts are for the ALJ, not the courts, to resolve.   See Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389936\"><a href=\"/opinion/389936/maria-s-rodriguez-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).  Thus, we find that there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ's conclusion that claimant could perform the demands of light work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Mental Impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether claimant's emotional impairment is disabling is a closer question.  He began experiencing emotional problems after he injured his back.  He received treatment for these problems at the Carolina Mental Health Center from March 1986 through February 1988.  See Exhibits 18 and 37.  At his initial evaluation, claimant stated that he had trouble sleeping, was irritable, lost his temper with his children, experienced headaches and some visual hallucinations at night.  The diagnosis, at this time, was an adjustment disorder with depression;  the prognosis was good with out-patient counseling recommended.  Clinic notes indicate that during 1986, claimant evinced little cooperation with treatment;  he stated that he was there only for the purpose of obtaining medication to help him sleep.  His case was terminated in January 1987, no real changes having occurred.  However, in December 1987, claimant was re-admitted to the out-patient program with the same complaints.  At this time, claimant was cooperative, goal-directed, relevant and his thought processes were intact.  Again, little gain appears to have been made with treatment and the record reflects that his last visit was in February 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant underwent four psychiatric evaluations-two in 1986 and two in 1987.  All the examiners agreed that claimant was coherent, logical, relevant and oriented.  See Exhibits 15, 17, 38 and 40.  Despite his subjective complaints of hallucinations, all four examiners also agreed that his thought processes were intact with no evidence of psychotic perceptions.  Although two examiners noted some impairment with recent and immediate memory, see Exhibits 17 and 40, this was not perceived as a major problem and all four agreed that claimant's judgment was, at a minimum, adequate.  Similarly, all four examiners agreed that claimant was anxious and distracted, with three observing that claimant appeared depressed.  See Exhibits 15, 38 and 40.  The most common diagnosis was depression related to claimant's accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evaluators differed as to the effect of claimant's mental condition or his ability to function at work.  A psychologist who tested claimant for the SIF, see Exhibit 17, determined that claimant had a borderline IQ of 76.  His vocational test scores revealed a strong interest in manual activities.  Despite the presence of \"mild to moderate\" anxiety which affected claimant's concentration, the psychologist believed that this condition was treatable on an out-patient counseling basis.  Claimant's work prognosis was \"very much acceptable\" and \"his emotional state and his intellectual capacities\" were \"appropriate\" for vocational rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the one examiner who completed a mental RFC assessment, see Exhibit 40, rated claimant's abilities to function in the following areas as \"poor or none\" (defined on the RFC form as \"[n]o useful ability to function\"):  (1) following work rules; (2) relating to co-workers;  (3) dealing with the public;  (4) interacting with supervisors;  (5) coping with work stresses;  (6) maintaining concentration;  (7) handling detailed or complex job instructions;  (8) behaving in an emotionally stable manner;  and (9) demonstrating reliability.  His abilities to use judgment, function independently and relate predictably in social situations were \"fair\"-defined as \"seriously limited, but not precluded.\"  Claimant had good (\"limited but satisfactory\") abilities in the areas of understanding, remembering and carrying out simple instructions and in maintaining personal appearance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two non-examining doctors completed RFC assessments in 1986.  See Exhibit 14.  They agreed that claimant had no significant limits in the following activities:  (1) remembering locations and work procedures;  (2) understanding, remembering and carrying out very short and simple instructions;  (3) making simple work-related decisions;  (4) asking simple questions;  (5) requesting assistance;  (6) acting in a socially appropriate manner; and (7) responding appropriately to changes in the work place.  Both also viewed claimant as being moderately limited in his capacity to maintain a normal work week without interruptions due to psychological symptoms, to accept criticism and to get along with co-workers.  These same evaluators, on the \"B\" criteria of the Psychiatric Review Technique (PRT) Form, rated claimant as slightly limited in daily living activities and moderately limited in social functioning;  claimant seldom experienced problems with concentration and never had episodes of deterioration at work or in work-like settings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, two non-examining physicians also completed PRT forms.  They opined that although claimant was anxious and depressed, his emotional condition was not severe.  See Exhibit 35.  As for the \"B\" criteria, claimant had slight limitations in daily living and social functioning, seldom experienced problems with concentration and never had problems with deterioration at work or in work-like settings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ also questioned the VE concerning the above evidence.  Again, the VE pointed out that the evidence was conflicting and the conclusions as to claimant's work abilities were dependent on what medical reports one utilized.  Based on the psychiatrist's report and the RFC evaluation, claimant would not be able to work at all.  However, the other reports, according to the VE, did not support such a finding of total disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we do not agree with the ALJ that claimant did not have any emotional impairment and even hesitate to find, as did the Appeals Council, that while such an impairment did exist, it had no significant effect on claimant, we believe that there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion that claimant was not precluded from work.  We first note, however, that the findings of moderate limitations in accommodating the demands of a work setting-i.e., regular attendance and the completion of a work-week without interruption-can erode the occupational base, at least marginally.   See Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532750\"><a href=\"/opinion/532750/28-socsecrepser-3-unemplinsrep-cch-15109a-victor-m-ortiz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 527 (1st Cir. 1989).  Nonetheless, given the presence of the RFC assessments indicating that claimant had the ability to follow simple instructions and that his attention and concentration were only minimally affected, along with the RFC assessments that claimant's emotional impairment was not severe, we cannot say that the VE's conclusion that claimant could work as a warehouse stock person was without record support.  Although the record could support a different conclusion, we again emphasize that conflicts in the record are for the Secretary.   See Irlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577108\"><a href=\"/opinion/577108/victor-j-irlanda-ortiz-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 770 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For some reason, claimant argues that the ALJ erred by relying on the grid and that the testimony of a VE was required.  It appears that claimant bases this contention on the first decision rendered by the ALJ in July 1987, rather than the most recent decision of June 1989</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
