Dr. Amarendra Tunga  filed similar actions\r                           \r\n\nin  state and federal court complaining of the termination of\r\n\nhis  temporary appointment  as  a visiting  scientist at  the\r\n\nUniversity of  Massachusetts at  Amherst.  Some  months after\r\n\nthe  state  court  suit  was dismissed,  the  district  court\r\n\ndismissed the instant action (1) on claim preclusion grounds,\r\n\n(2) for failure to  state a claim, and (3)  because plaintiff\r\n\nhad  not   adequately  justified  his  failure   to  file  an\r\n\nopposition to  defendants' motion to  dismiss.  As  the first\r\n\nrationale  provides  ample  support  for  the  court's action\r\n\n(especially now that plaintiff's  appeal from the state court\r\n\njudgment has been dismissed), we affirm on that basis alone.\r\n\n     Little discussion  is required.   A federal  court \"must\r\n\ngive preclusive effect to state court judgments in accordance\r\n\nwith state law,\"  Mulrain v.  Board of Selectmen  of Town  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nLeicester, 944 F.2d 23, 25 (1st  Cir. 1991); we thus look  to\r                     \r\n\nMassachusetts res judicata principles.  In Isaac v. Schwartz,\r                                                                        \r\n\n706 F.2d 15 (1st  Cir. 1983), we summarized those  principles\r\n\nas follows: \r\n\n     Massachusetts  courts  apply  res  judicata   in  a\r\n     perfectly traditional manner.   That is to say, the\r\n     doctrine prevents the  relitigation of \"issues that\r\n     were  or could have  been dealt with  in an earlier\r\n     litigation.\"    The  entry  of a  valid  and  final\r\n     judgment on the merits \"extinguishes ... all rights\r\n     of  a plaintiff to  remedies against  the defendant\r\n     with respect to all or any part of the transaction,\r\n     or series  of connected transactions,  out of which\r\n     the complaint arose.\"\r\n          ....\r\r\n\n     ....    In Massachusetts,  as  elsewhere,  a second\r\n     claim  is barred  \"even  though  the  plaintiff  is\r\n     prepared  in  the  second  action  ...  to  present\r\n     evidence,  grounds, or  theories  of  the case  not\r\n     presented in the  first action ....\"   The issue is\r\n     \"not  whether  the  plaintiff in  fact  argued  his\r\n     [civil  rights] claims in the state proceeding, but\r\n     whether he could have.\"\r\n\nId. at 16-17 (citations  omitted); accord, e.g., Willhauck v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHalpin, 953 F.2d 689, 704-05 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                  \r\n\n     The  instant case clearly falters under these standards.\r\n\nIndeed, the  state and  federal complaints (both  as amended)\r\n\nare virtually verbatim copies of one another--to the point of\r\n\nsharing the  same typographical  errors.   Plaintiff protests\r\n\nthat the respective legal theories diverge, in that his state\r\n\naction focused on slander while the federal action advanced a\r\n\nhost of civil rights and constitutional claims.  Even if true\r\n\n(and the language of the complaints indicates otherwise), all\r\n\nsuch allegations \"grow[] out of the same transaction, act, or\r\n\nagreement and seek[] redress for the same wrong.\"  Mackintosh\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.
