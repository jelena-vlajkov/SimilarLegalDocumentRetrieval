This action  is before  us on  appeal\r                                \n\nfrom a decision of  the United States District Court  for the\n\nDistrict  of Puerto  Rico  affirming the  bankruptcy  court's\n\nfinding  that although  PREPA owes Scotland  Guard $42,859.77\n\nrepresenting (1) amounts it admits  are owed, (2) amounts for\n\nwhich it provides no evidence of payment, and (3) unexplained\n\ndeductions from  payments for services rendered,  it does not\n\nowe  an  additional  $645,893.38  claimed   by  Scotland  for\n\ndeductions from the contract price that  Scotland effectively\n\naccepted  via  cashing  PREPA's  checks  or  for expenditures\n\nincurred by  Scotland due  to an intervening  enactment of  a\n\nfederal minimum wage.  We affirm.\n\n          Scotland's  first contention  is that  the district\n\ncourt  incorrectly   applied  the  doctrine  of   accord  and\n\nsatisfaction to its cashing of PREPA's checks in  payment for\n\nservices rendered.  Scotland maintains that it accepted these\n\nchecks  as partial  payment  only, and  continued to  invoice\n\nPREPA  for the  unpaid amounts.   PREPA  points first  to its\n\ncontract with Scotland,  which explicitly allowed  deductions\n\nfrom  the contract price where Scotland failed to comply with\n\ncertain contract  terms, then to the  endorsements carried on\n\nits checks to  Scotland which  state that they  are \"in  full\n\npayment of  the account  stated\" on the  accompanying voucher\n\nand  \"payee by this endorsement accepts  it as such payment,\"\n\nin arguing that accord and satisfaction applies.\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          In  H.R. Electroplating,  Inc.  v.  Rodriguez,  114\r                                                                   \n\nD.P.R. 236  (1983),  the  court  makes  clear  that  a  claim\n\nunliquidated,  or  involving  a  bona  fide  controversy,  is\r                                                       \n\nsatisfied  upon acceptance by the creditor of a sum less than\n\nthat it claims.  If it  is not agreeable to this  resolution,\n\nit  \"has  the  duty  of  returning  to  the  debtor  the  sum\r                                                                         \n\noffered, . . . [and] cannot take advantage of the offer . . .\r                   \n\nin  order, after receiving  the same, to  claim the balance.\"\n\nId., at 244, quoting Lopez v. South P.R. Sugar Co., 62 P.R.R.\r                                                              \n\n227, (1943) (emphasis in original).  \n\n          The  district  court applied  Puerto  Rican law  in\n\ndetermining that the requisites of the doctrine of accord and\n\nsatisfaction had been met, absolving PREPA of the duty to pay\n\nthe bulk  of the sum Scotland  claims is due.2   Not only did\n\nScotland cash  PREPA's checks, but  there is  no evidence  to\n\nsuggest  that  it registered  any  objection  to the  amounts\n\noffered  at the time.   The checks  and accompanying vouchers\n\nexplicitly  drew Scotland's  attention to  the fact  that the\n\npayments included deductions from the contract price and why,\n\nthat  PREPA intended  them to  be in  full payment,  and that\n\nScotland would  signal their acceptance as  such by endorsing\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.      The  bankruptcy  court   determined  that  $42,859.77\nrepresenting (1)  amounts PREPA admits are  owed, (2) amounts\nfor  which  PREPA provided  no evidence  of payment,  and (3)\nunexplained deductions  by PREPA  from payments  for services\nrendered  by   Scotland  were  not  covered   by  accord  and\nsatisfaction, and thus remained due and payable.  \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nand cashing  the checks.   It is not  enough for  Scotland to\n\nsay, \"Appellant obviously did  not perceive PREPA's checks to\n\nbe  in total  payments  of debts  when  it continues  issuing\n\ninvoices to PREPA.\"\n\n          Scotland contends next that  the doctrine of  rebus\r                                                                         \n\nsic sanctibus, or impossibility,  should have been applied to\r                         \n\nits  contract with PREPA to find that PREPA should absorb the\n\ncost increase  that  resulted from  the  enactment of  a  new\n\nfederal minimum  wage law.   Puerto  Rican  law requires  the\n\nmodification  of  the terms  of  a  contract when  unforeseen\n\ncircumstances  render it  \"impossible for  a party  to comply\n\nwith its  duties.\" Medina  &amp; Medina  v. Country  Pride Foods,\r                                                                         \n\nLtd.,  631  F.Supp.  293, 298  (D.P.R.  1986).    This is  an\r                \n\n\"extraordinary  remedy   to  be   applied  only   in  extreme\n\ncircumstances.\"   Id.  The  new minimum wage  law, which made\r                                 \n\nthe  federal minimum  wage mandatory  for the  first  time in\n\nPuerto Rico, went into effect when approximately 10 months of\n\nScotland's  contract  with  PREPA  remained.   Not  only  did\n\nScotland continue  to perform,  no evidence was  presented to\n\nsuggest  that   it  made   any  objection  or   assertion  of\n\nonerousness  or impracticability  at  any time  prior to  the\n\ntermination  of the contract period.  This falls far short of\n\nimpossibility.\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
