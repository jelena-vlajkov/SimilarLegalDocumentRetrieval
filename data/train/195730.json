The order grants the motions of\n\nappellee, Garden Way, for compliance with a previously issued\n\nprotective  order and  for  sanctions for  violations of  the\n\norder.   It also orders Libner to undertake specific steps to\n\ncomply  with  the previous  order.

However, even if we were to assume that\n\nthe April 7 order operates as an injunction, the order is not\n\nyet  appealable since Libner has failed to meet his burden of\n\nshowing the order \"might cause [him] irreparable consequences\n\nif  not immediately  reviewed.\"   Carson  v.
