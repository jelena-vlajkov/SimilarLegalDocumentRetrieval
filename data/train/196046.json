His\n\namended schedules of assets  valued the personal injury claim  at\n\n$40,000,  and Schedule  B-4  asserted related  exemptions in  the\n\nmanner set  out in the margin.1  The chapter 7 trustee interposed\n\nno  Rule 4003(b)  objection to  the list  of property  claimed as\n\nexempt.   See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(b) (fixing 30-day limitation\r                       \n\nperiod for filing objection); see  also Bankruptcy Code   522(l),\r                                                 \n\n                    \r                              \n\n     1The pertinent entries in Schedule B-4 were as follows:\n\nType of Property:\nLocation, Description,                                    Exempt\nUse                               Statute                 Amount\r                                                                          \n\nPossible personal injury                                  DEBTOR\nSettlement\n\nDisability                    11 USC   522(d)(10)(C)      100%\n\nPayment on account of         11 USC   522(d)(11)(D)      $7,500\n  personal bodily injury\n\nPayment in compensation for   11 USC   522(d)(11)(E)      100%\n  loss of future earnings\n\nAny property selected by      11 USC   522(d)(5)          $3,750\n  debtor\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n11  U.S.C.    522(l).    The  personal injury  action  eventually\n\ngenerated a $50,000 settlement fund,  with no specification as to\n\nwhat,   if   any,   portion   represented  compensation   for   a\n\n\"disability,\"  \"personal  bodily  injury\"  or  \"loss   of  future\n\nearnings.\"2  \n\n          Mercer nevertheless  contended that the  entire $50,000\r                                                                   \n\nwas  exempt  because he  had claimed  the  entire fund  exempt as\n\ncompensation   for   a   \"disability\"   under   Bankruptcy   Code\n\n  522(d)(10)(C) or  compensation for  lost future  earnings under\n\nBankruptcy Code   522(d)(11)(E).   See  supra note 1.   Since  no\r                                                       \n\nRule 4003(b) objection was submitted within the 30-day limitation\n\nperiod,   Mercer  argued   that   the  bankruptcy   court  lacked\n\njurisdiction to  entertain the  motion to disallow  his exemption\n\nclaim.  He relied  on Taylor v. Freeland &amp; Kronz, 112 S. Ct. 1644\r                                                          \n\n(1992),  which held  that a  bankruptcy court  could not  order a\n\nchapter  7 debtor's  attorney  to turn  over proceeds  ultimately\n\nrecovered in a  prepetition lawsuit brought by the  debtor, where\n\nthe trustee had decided to  file no Rule 4003(b) objection  to an\n\nexemption claim in the  lawsuit proceeds notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat there was no colorable legal basis for claiming an exemption\r                                                 \n\nin the total amount recovered. \r                      \n\n          The  chapter 7  trustee in  the instant  case responded\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     2Unlike the unlimited exemptions for  \"disability\" and \"lost\nearnings,\"   the   exemption   for   \"personal   bodily   injury\"\ncompensation  had been capped at  $7,500.  See  Bankruptcy Code  \r                                                        \n522(d)(11)(D), 11 U.S.C.    522(d)(11)(D) (subsequently increased\nto $15,000).  The  trustee did not contest the  $7,500 exemption.\nThus, $42,500 remains in dispute on appeal.\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nthat  he had filed no  Rule 4003(b) objection  because Mercer had\n\nclaimed  allowable   exemptions   in  the   settlement   proceeds\r                            \n\nrepresenting  compensation   for  \"disability\"  or   lost  future\n\nearnings.  Consequently,  it remained for the bankruptcy court to\n\ndetermine whether the $42,500 in dispute did, in fact, constitute\n\ncompensation for disability and/or lost future earnings.  \n\n          The  bankruptcy court  took  the position  that a  Rule\n\n4003(b) objection is  not required unless the exemption  claim   \n\nas was the  case in Taylor, 112  S. Ct. at 1646     raises a \"red\r                                    \n\nflag\"; that  is, unless the exemption  claim includes unambiguous\r                                                                           \n\nlanguage  indicating that  the debtor  is asserting  an exemption\n\nclaim which would exceed the maximum statutory allowance.  Mercer\r                                                                           \n\nv.  Monzack, 158  B.R.  886,  888  (Bankr.  D.R.I.  1993).    The\r                     \n\nbankruptcy court  hypothesized, for example, that  a Rule 4003(b)\n\nobjection might  have been  necessary if  Mercer  had listed  the\n\nexemption claim simply as  \"Disability\" and the exempt  amount as\n\n\"100%,\"  instead of breaking  down the settlement  fund into four\n\nalternative components.  But since the Mercer exemption claim was\n\nframed in  four alternative parts, each  asserting facially valid\n\nstatutory exemptions under section 522(d),  see supra note 1, the\r                                                               \n\nbankruptcy  court   concluded  that  it  raised   no  \"red  flag\"\n\nsufficient to trigger the limitation period in Rule 4003(b).\n\n          The bankruptcy  court therefore  ruled that  Taylor did\r                                                                       \n\nnot preclude  its assertion of jurisdiction  to determine whether\n\nthe  settlement fund represented  compensation for  disability or\n\nlost future  earnings.  Mercer, 158  B.R. at 888.   It then found\r                                        \n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthat the settlement fund  included no compensation for disability\n\nor  lost future  earnings.   Id.  at  888-89.   Accordingly,  the\r                                          \n\nbankruptcy  court ordered Mercer to  turn over all  but $7,350 to\n\nthe  chapter  7   trustee.3    The  district  court  affirmed  on\n\nintermediate  appeal.

Thus,  it remained for  the\n\nbankruptcy  court  to  determine  whether the  \"property  of  the\n\nestate\"  actually in dispute became exempt by operation of law as\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nMercer maintained, or remained  subject to administration for the\n\nbenefit of creditors as the chapter 7 trustee contended.   \n\n          The  threshold  question  is  whether the  property  in\n\ndispute is in fact  the property of the estate  listed as exempt.\r                            \n\nIn  stark contrast to Taylor,  the bankruptcy court  found    and\r                                      \n\nMercer does not contest on appeal    that no part of the disputed\n\n$42,500  listed  on Schedule  B-4  is either  compensation  for a\n\ndisability        522(d)(10)(C)     or  lost  future earnings    \n\n  522(d)(11)(E)       as  distinguished  from   compensation  for\n\npersonal  bodily  injury  (the  maximum  $7,500  exemption  under\n\n  522(d)(11)(D) as compensation for personal bodily injury is not\n\nat issue).  Rather,  in a giant interpretive leap  beyond Taylor,\r                                                                          \n\nMercer asks us to assume that the amount in dispute became exempt\n\nby  operation of  law  under section  522(l) notwithstanding  the\n\nuncontested finding  that it is not compensation for a disability\r                                             \n\nor lost future earnings.\n\n          True,  Taylor  requires  that  we interpret  and  apply\r                                 \n\nsection  522(l) and  Bankruptcy Rule  4003(b) according  to their\n\nliteral  intendment.

Rather, as  the Court\n\nrecognized in Taylor,  112 S.

E.D. Okla.\r                                  \n\n1989), it remained for the  bankruptcy court to determine whether\n\nthe  disputed right  or interest  in property  of the  estate was\n\nlisted on Schedule B-4. \n\n          Neither Taylor,  the Code, nor the  Rules of Bankruptcy\r                                  \n\nProcedure require  parties in interest to  interpose Rule 4003(b)\n\nobjections to Schedule B-4 exemption claims in  order to preserve\n\ntheir right  to invoke the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt to determine whether  property of the estate  became exempt\n\nby  operation of  law.   What  parties  in interest  may not  do,\n\nhowever, is let  the limitation period for  objections under Rule\n\n4003(b) expire, then enlist  the jurisdiction of the court  in an\n\neffort to  set aside an exemption allowed  by operation of law in\n\nproperty of  the estate under  section 522(l) simply  because the\n\nproperty  listed  as exempt  would  not  have  been  entitled  to\n\nexemption  under section 522(d)  but for their  failure to object\n\npursuant to Rule 4003(b).4 \n                    \r                              \n\n     4The  Supreme Court  has not  excluded the  possibility that\nBankruptcy  Code   105(a),  11  U.S.C.   105(a),  might enable  a\nbankruptcy  court to  set aside  exemptions not  claimed  in good\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \n\n          In  sum, we affirm on  the ground that  the property of\n\nthe estate  at issue on  appeal was  neither listed as  exempt on\n\nSchedule  B-4, nor  became  exempt  by  operation  of  law  under\n\nBankruptcy Code   522(l).  \n\n          The  district  court  judgment is  affirmed;  costs  to\r                    The  district  court  judgment is  affirmed;  costs  to\r                                                                           \n\nappellee. \r          appellee.\r                  \n\n                    \r                              \n\nfaith.
