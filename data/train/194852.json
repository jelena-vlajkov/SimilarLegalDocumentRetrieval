During his first\r\n\r\nyear in office,  Mayor Aponte  either terminated,  or refused  to\r\n\r\nrenew,  several  hundred  non-policymaking  city  employees hired\r\n\r\nunder the  previous administration.   In letters of  dismissal to\r\n\r\nthe employees, Aponte claimed that the City faced a severe fiscal\r\n\r\ncrisis, and  disclosed  various criteria  for  determining  which\r\n\r\nmunicipal  employees were to be terminated in order to effect the\r\n\r\nnecessary economies:\r\n\r\n          (1)  employees hired  without compliance with\r\n               Commonwealth or municipal personnel laws\r\n               and  regulations,  see, e.g.,  P.R. Laws\r\n                                           \r\n               Ann. tit. 3,    1331-1337, which dictate\r\n               the  public  posting of  available posi-\r\n               tions and competitive examinations;\r\n\r\n          (2)  employees hired or  promoted during  the\r\n               1984  \"veda,\" or  \"electoral prohibition\r\n               period,\"  a  four-month \"window\"  before\r\n               and  after  a municipal  election during\r\n               which hiring, renewals, or promotions by\r\n               the  incumbent  administration are  pro-\r\n               scribed by law;\r\n\r\n          (3)  employees  who submitted  no documentary\r\n               proof  that  they possessed  the minimum\r\n               education  and  experience required  for\r\n               their positions; \r\n\r\n          (4)  employees   whose  job   positions  were\r\n               deemed  nonessential, and  therefore ex-\r\n               pendable; or\r\n\r\n                                3\r\n\r\n          (5)  employees  who had  committed employment\r\n               infractions  (e.g., unexcused  leaves of\r\n                                 \r\n               absence, chronic tardiness).\r\n\r\n          In March 1986, 357 terminated employees, claiming poli-\r\n\r\ntical affiliation with  the ousted NPP, brought the present civil\r\n\r\nrights action  under  42 U.S.C.    1983 against  the City,  Mayor\r\n\r\nAponte, Jose A. del Valle (at times, the acting mayor), and Felix\r\n\r\nMartinez (the personnel officer).   Plaintiffs alleged that their\r\n\r\ndismissals were due solely to their NPP affiliation, in violation\r\n\r\nof  their First Amendment and due process rights under the United\r\n\r\nStates  Constitution.   The  complaint demanded  compensatory and\r\n\r\npunitive damages, as well as reinstatement.1\r\n\r\n          The claims of 255 plaintiffs went to the jury following\r\n\r\na  four-month trial, and defendant  verdicts were returned on the\r\n\r\nclaims  of 240 plaintiffs.   Six plaintiffs  were awarded compen-\r\n\r\nsatory damages  (from $1700  to $10,440)  against  the City,  and\r\n\r\npunitive damages ($25,000) against  Aponte, while nine plaintiffs\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     1Three  municipal employee classifications  were involved in\r\nthe challenged terminations:  (1) \"regular\" employees,  occupying\r\npermanent  or   career  municipal  positions,   (2)  \"transitory\"\r\nemployees,  appointed  without  the  usual   personnel  screening\r\nprocedures  (e.g.,  postings and  competitive  examinations), but\r\n                 \r\nsubject to  periodic renewals at  the expiration  of their  fixed\r\nterms, and (3) \"contractual\" workers, hired for fixed terms under\r\nfederally funded  programs (e.g., HUD) administered  by the City.\r\n                                \r\n\"Transitory\" employees  lack tenure, or  a reasonable expectation\r\nin  the indefinite  continuation  of their  employment after  the\r\nexpiration of their fixed term.   While their lack of  a property\r\ninterest in their  employment positions  generally precludes  due\r\nprocess claims  for a politically discriminatory dismissal, First\r\nAmendment discrimination claims are not precluded.

Castro-Davila,  865  F.2d 431,  436  (1st Cir.  1989);\r\n                        \r\nEstrada-Izquierdo  v.

The  district court\r\n\r\ndenied all claims for  reinstatement.  Finally, in May  1992, the\r\n\r\ncourt  set aside  all fifteen  plaintiff verdicts.    The present\r\n\r\nappeal  is brought by  eleven of the  fifteen disappointed plain-\r\n\r\ntiffs.\r\n\r\n                            DISCUSSION\r\n                                      \r\n\r\nA.

Although literally  correct, the  quoted statement\r\n\r\ngives us pause, especially  in light of the citation  to Burdine.\r\n                                                                \r\n\r\nSince a proper allocation of the burden of persuasion is critical\r\n\r\nto our  assessment of  the district  court's decision  under Rule\r\n\r\n50(b), we first revisit the applicable burden-shifting procedure.\r\n\r\n          Under  Title VII,  a plaintiff  must establish  a prima\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nfacie case  of employment discrimination,  at which point  a pre-\r\n     \r\n\r\nsumption of discrimination  attaches to the plaintiff's claim.

The employer\r\n\r\nneed  not  submit  sufficient  evidence to  \"persuade  the  [fact\r\n\r\nfinder].\"   Burdine, 450 U.S. at  254.  In other  words, notwith-\r\n                   \r\n\r\nstanding the interim  shift in  the burden of  production to  the\r\n\r\nemployer, the plaintiff-employee in a Title VII case \"retains the\r\n\r\nburden of persuasion\" at all times.  Id.\r\n                                        \r\n\r\n          By  contrast,  under  the  Mt.  Healthy burden-shifting\r\n                                                 \r\n\r\nmechanism applicable to  a First Amendment political  discrimina-\r\n\r\ntion  claim, the burden of persuasion itself passes to the defen-\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\ndant-employer once  the  plaintiff produces  sufficient  evidence\r\n             \r\n\r\n                                8\r\n\r\nfrom which the fact  finder reasonably can infer that  the plain-\r\n\r\ntiff's  protected conduct  was  a  \"substantial\" or  \"motivating\"\r\n                                 \r\n\r\nfactor behind  her dismissal.   Accordingly, once  the burden  of\r\n\r\npersuasion  shifts  to  the  defendant-employer,  the  plaintiff-\r\n\r\nemployee will prevail unless the  fact finder concludes that  the\r\n\r\ndefendant  has produced  enough  evidence to  establish that  the\r\n\r\nplaintiff's  dismissal  would  have  occurred in  any  event  for\r\n\r\nnondiscriminatory reasons.\r\n\r\n          Therefore, we  can sustain a  Rule 50(b) reversal  in a\r\n\r\npolitical discrimination  case only if:  (1)  the record evidence\r\n\r\ncompelled the conclusion that the  plaintiff would have been dis-\r\n         \r\n\r\nmissed in  any event for  nondiscriminatory reasons,  or (2)  the\r\n\r\nplaintiff  did not  introduce  sufficient evidence  in the  first\r\n\r\ninstance to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendants.  We\r\n\r\naddress these alternatives in turn.\r\n\r\nB.   The \"Austerity\" Defense\r\n                            \r\n\r\n          Through  numerous  expert  witnesses   and  statistical\r\n\r\ndata,4   defendants  attempted to  establish that  all the  chal-\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     4For  example,  defendants  presented  the  following uncon-\r\ntroverted evidence:  1)  in 1985, there were  approximately 2,900\r\nCity employees, including 906 \"transitory\" employees, 459 of whom\r\nhad  been appointed by  the former administration  in fiscal year\r\n1984 alone;  2) the  former mayor  had made 250-300  appointments\r\nbetween July and October 1984; 3) in 1984, despite warnings about\r\nthe City's worsening budgetary problems, the former mayor renewed\r\nall transitory employees' expiring  appointments; 4) by 1985, the\r\n   \r\npersonnel payroll comprised 80% of the City's budget; 5) in 1985,\r\ndefendant  Aponte inherited  a debt  of $116  million, which  has\r\nsince  been reduced to $30 million, and an accumulated deficit of\r\n$30 million,  since reduced to $3 million;  and 6) by 1991, there\r\nwere 1,966 City  employees, only eight of whom  were \"transitory\"\r\nemployees. \r\n\r\n                                9\r\n\r\nlenged dismissals  were due  to  the fiscal  crisis inherited  by\r\n\r\nMayor  Aponte when he took  office in 1985,  which the defendants\r\n\r\nattributed to mismanagement or illegal patronage hiring practices\r\n\r\non  the part of the previous administration.  The jury reasonably\r\n\r\ncould  have found that the dismissals made by the incoming admin-\r\n\r\nistration resulted  in a 32%  net reduction of  approximately 900\r\n\r\nCity employees (from 2,869  to 1,966), and that no  new employees\r\n\r\nwere hired  to perform  the duties of  the dismissed  plaintiffs.\r\n\r\nThus, the jury reasonably  could have concluded that a  bona fide\r\n\r\nfiscal  crisis  would have  compelled  the vast  majority  of the\r\n\r\nchallenged dismissals even if the targeted employees had not been\r\n\r\naffiliated with the NPP.                Defendants' well-deployed\r\n\r\n\"austerity\" defense apparently  thwarted the claims of 240 of the\r\n\r\n255 plaintiffs whose cases went  to the jury.  But blunt  instru-\r\n\r\nments make crude scalpels,  and the Mt. Healthy defense  requires\r\n                                               \r\n\r\nindividualized  scrutiny by  the jury  with a  view to  whether a\r\n\r\nparticular plaintiff's position would have  been eliminated under\r\n\r\nAponte's austerity  program but for the  plaintiff's NPP affilia-\r\n                                   \r\n\r\ntion.    In  other  words, even  though  defendants'  overarching\r\n\r\nausterity  defense may  have established that  massive dismissals\r\n\r\nwere imperative, it did  not compel jury verdicts adverse  to all\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nplaintiffs.

Here, some  plaintiffs testified that  their posi-\r\n\r\ntions  remained intact after  their termination  and specifically\r\n\r\nidentified their replacements;  the jury was free to  credit this\r\n\r\n                                10\r\n\r\ntestimony, despite testimony to the contrary.

The Individualized Defenses\r\n                                \r\n\r\n          The defendants  attempted  to establish  their  indivi-\r\n\r\ndualized  Mt. Healthy defenses at trial based largely on the con-\r\n                     \r\n\r\ntemporaneous justifications relied on  in Mayor Aponte's  letters\r\n\r\nof dismissal.  See supra  p. 3.

First, to the extent the reasons given by the employ-\r\n\r\ner at the time of the  dismissal are later proven false or frivo-\r\n\r\nlous,  the weight of the evidence of discriminatory animus may be\r\n\r\nenhanced, thereby contributing significantly to the threshold Mt.\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nHealthy  showing the  plaintiff-employee  must make  in order  to\r\n       \r\n\r\nshift the ultimate burden  of persuasion to the defendant-employ-\r\n\r\n                                11\r\n\r\ner.   Second, once  the burden of  persuasion has shifted  to the\r\n\r\nemployer, the jury would  be entitled to find for  the plaintiff-\r\n\r\nemployee  were it  to conclude  that the  employer did  not offer\r\n\r\nsufficient evidence to demonstrate  that (i) the proffered reason\r\n\r\nfor the dismissal  was genuine or (ii) a bona  fide basis existed\r\n                                 \r\n\r\nwhich  would have  prompted the  dismissal without regard  to the\r\n\r\nemployee's political affiliation.   We reserve these  individual-\r\n\r\nized defenses for consideration with plaintiffs' evidence.\r\n\r\n          Leaving  aside  certain  proffered  justifications  for\r\n\r\nemployee dismissals in the First  Amendment political discrimina-\r\n\r\ntion context,5  only two  individualized defenses remain  for our\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     5Some  of  the  proffered  justifications   for  defendants'\r\nemployment  actions must be pared  to accord with applicable law.\r\nAlthough  evidence that  an employee  was hired  in violation  of\r\nCommonwealth law precludes a  finding that the employee possessed\r\na property interest in continued employment, and hence a cogniza-\r\nble  due process claim, Kauffman, 841 F.2d at 1173, evidence that\r\n                                \r\nan employee's appointment  was a \"nullity\" under  Puerto Rico law\r\nab initio  does not control a  claim alleging a violation  of the\r\n         \r\nemployee's  First Amendment  right of political  affiliation, see\r\n                                                                 \r\nHiraldo-Cancel, 925  F.2d at 13  (\"'We do  not think  that a  new\r\n              \r\nadministration can use the  \"nullity\" of appointments doctrine as\r\na  cover  for  discharges,  transfers,  and discrimination  based\r\nsolely  on political  affiliation'\") (quoting  Santiago-Negron v.\r\n                                                              \r\nCastro-Davila, 865  F.2d 431, 436-37 (1st Cir.  1989)).  Although\r\n             \r\ndefendants argue  that the  rationale of  Santiago-Negron applies\r\n                                                         \r\nonly if the new administration continues to hire new personnel in\r\n                                        \r\nviolation  of the  Personnel Act,  Santiago-Negron rested  on the\r\n                                                  \r\nground  that state law does not and cannot define First Amendment\r\n                                                 \r\nrights.   Santiago-Negron, 865 F.2d at  436.  We do  not suggest,\r\n                         \r\nhowever,  that  evidence  relating  to  the  plaintiff-employee's\r\n                        \r\nqualifications  under  the  applicable personnel  regulations  is\r\nimmaterial.   For example,  an employee's lack  of qualifications\r\nfor  the position,  at the  time of  the  dismissal, may  well be\r\n                                                   \r\nconsidered a nondiscriminatory basis for the dismissal.  The jury\r\nmust determine whether such  a lack of qualifications was  a real\r\nor pretextual justification for the dismissal.  \r\n     On analogous  reasoning, we  discount two variations  on the\r\nsame  defensive theme.  First, the fact that some plaintiffs were\r\nappointed or  promoted during the \"veda,\"  the electoral prohibi-\r\n\r\n                                12\r\n\r\nconsideration in the present case, based on the evidence relating\r\n\r\nto  each appellant's claim:  (1) whether the plaintiff was quali-\r\n\r\nfied for the  position at the time of the  dismissal, and (2), if\r\n\r\nso, whether  the  position was  eliminated for  nondiscriminatory\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nD.   Plaintiffs' Evidence\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          Plaintiffs offered little direct evidence of discrimin-\r\n\r\natory  animus.  But see  infra notes 6 &amp; 8.   Nevertheless, as we\r\n                              \r\n\r\nhave held,  \"circumstantial evidence alone can  support a finding\r\n\r\nof political discrimination.\"  Anthony, 952 F.2d at 605; Estrada-\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nIzquierdo, 850 F.2d at  14.  Certain general observations  can be\r\n         \r\n\r\nmade concerning the circumstantial evidence bearing on the claims\r\n\r\nof  all eleven  plaintiffs.   Mere temporal  proximity between  a\r\n\r\nchange  of administration  and a  public employee's  dismissal is\r\n\r\ninsufficient  to  establish  discriminatory  animus.  Cf. Aviles-\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\ntion  period, is not necessarily  controlling in the First Amend-\r\nment context.  \"Puerto Rico law is not controlling in the area of\r\n                                                  \r\nfirst amendment law,\" Santiago-Negron,  865 F.2d at 436 (emphasis\r\n                                     \r\nadded), and, in  this respect, we  see no principled  distinction\r\nbetween the Commonwealth's personnel and electoral laws.  Second,\r\nit is not necessarily  a sufficient defense that a  plaintiff did\r\nnot  meet the  legally  mandated minimum  qualifications for  the\r\nposition at  the time of  appointment.   See Hiraldo-Cancel,  925\r\n                                                           \r\nF.2d at  13; Santiago-Negron, 865  F.2d at  436.

Thus,  the jury\r\n\r\n                                14\r\n\r\nreasonably could  have concluded  that those appellants  who were\r\n\r\npublicly identified as  close political allies of  the former NPP\r\n\r\nmayor were more conspicuous targets for political discrimination.\r\n\r\nStanding alone, even the circumstantial evidence that some plain-\r\n\r\ntiffs  were  especially  conspicuous  targets  for discriminatory\r\n\r\nemployment  action by  defendants  would give  us serious  pause.\r\n\r\nWith  but two exceptions, however,  a careful review  of the evi-\r\n\r\ndence reveals  that appellants  plainly presented  other evidence\r\n\r\nsufficient to  shift the burden of  persuasion, effectively fore-\r\n\r\nclosing any realistic claim for Rule 50(b) relief by  defendants.\r\n\r\nWe briefly  recount  the dispositive  evidentiary  considerations\r\n\r\nbearing on each appellant's claim.\r\n\r\n     1.   Brenda Aponte Osorio\r\n                              \r\n\r\n          Ms.  Aponte was dismissed  from her \"regular\" position,\r\n\r\nas an  Executive Officer IV, in  May 1985.  In  addition to other\r\n\r\ndirect evidence of discriminatory animus,6 the letter of dismiss-\r\n\r\nal  from Mayor Aponte stated  that Ms. Aponte  apparently did not\r\n\r\npossess the qualifications for her  position    in particular,  a\r\n\r\ncollege degree  and \"considerable\" relevant work  experience.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the written  job description  for an  Executive Officer  IV\r\n\r\nlists a  college degree as \"desirable  preparation,\" but provides\r\n\r\nthat a \"combination of preparation and experience will be accept-\r\n\r\nable\"; it  defines  \"experience\"  as  \"positions  of  progressive\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     6Ms. Aponte states that she was constructively dismissed one\r\nday after the new administration took office, when she was denied\r\naccess to  her office, told that she was \"not a person of trust,\"\r\nand given no further duties.  Her protests went unanswered.\r\n\r\n                                15\r\n\r\nresponsibility . . .  in the public service,  including consider-\r\n\r\nable  administrative  or  supervision  experience.\"     (Emphasis\r\n                                                 \r\n\r\nadded.)  At trial, Ms. Aponte testified that she attended college\r\n\r\nfor  three years,  and began working  for the  City in  1978 as a\r\n\r\nsupervisor in the Human Resources Department.7\r\n          \r\n\r\n          Ms.  Aponte presented  sufficient evidence to  enable a\r\n\r\njury to find that she possessed the required qualifications, both\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nat the  time of her  appointment and  dismissal.  The  jury could\r\n\r\nhave  concluded,  therefore,  that   defendants'  contemporaneous\r\n\r\njustification was a  mere pretext  for political  discrimination.\r\n\r\nCf. Aponte-Santiago  v. Lopez-Rivera, 957  F.2d 40, 43  (1st Cir.\r\n                                    \r\n\r\n1992)  (reversing summary  judgment  for defendant;  noting  that\r\n\r\nproof  that defendant's  asserted  nondiscriminatory  reason  for\r\n\r\ndismissal  was pretextual is a \"link in a chain of circumstantial\r\n\r\nevidence\" of  political discrimination  which, when  coupled with\r\n\r\nallegedly \"conclusory\" evidence as to the  timing of demotion and\r\n\r\nthe parties' political affiliation, creates a triable issue which\r\n\r\nthe fact finder might resolve in plaintiff's favor); Anthony, 952\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\nF.2d at  606 (plaintiff's  obvious qualifications can  be circum-\r\n\r\nstantial evidence  of discriminatory  animus); cf. also  Burns v.\r\n                                                              \r\n\r\nGadsden  State Community College, 908 F.2d  1512, 1519 (11th Cir.\r\n                                \r\n\r\n1990)  (employer's exceedingly  narrow interpretation  of minimum\r\n\r\n\"experience\" required  for position, coupled with  other evidence\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     7Even though their individualized defenses, in many instanc-\r\nes, succumbed  to this  same \"equivalency\" virus,  permitting the\r\njury  to make  reasonable  substitutions of  work experience  for\r\neducational  background,  defendants  have  not  challenged these\r\nsubstitutions on appeal.\r\n\r\n                                16\r\n\r\nof discriminatory  animus, creates genuine dispute  as to whether\r\n\r\nemployer \"invented\" excuse as pretext to mask improper motive for\r\n\r\ndismissal  in  ADEA  action).   The  circumstantial  evidence  of\r\n\r\npretext,  coupled  with  the  direct  evidence of  discriminatory\r\n\r\nanimus, was  sufficient  to shift  the  burden of  persuasion  to\r\n\r\ndefendants.   As there was no conclusive evidence that Ms. Aponte\r\n\r\nwould have been  dismissed in any  event for a  nondiscriminatory\r\n\r\nreason, the jury verdict must be sustained.\r\n\r\n     2.   Dorotea Collazo Rivera\r\n                                \r\n\r\n          Ms. Collazo  was dismissed from her \"regular\" position,\r\n\r\nas an Administrative Assistant I, in January 1986.8  The dismiss-\r\n\r\nal letter  asserted that  Collazo's termination was  based on  an\r\n\r\nabsence of evidence that she was ever qualified for her position.\r\n\r\nHowever, Collazo's job description merely required  a \"desirable\"\r\n\r\n(high  school  diploma)  education/experience   (\"general  office\r\n\r\nwork\") mix.  Collazo  testified that she met the  posted academic\r\n\r\npreparation component  of the  job description.   Moreover, there\r\n\r\nwas  no  dispute that  Collazo, who  was  appointed to  her final\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nposition with the City  in 1981, previously had been  employed as\r\n        \r\n\r\nan  office clerk for the City since 1976.  Thus, Collazo likewise\r\n                                        \r\n\r\nsucceeded in shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendants,\r\n\r\nand defendants simply failed to persuade the jury.\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     8When the  new administration took over, Collazo's secretary\r\nwas transferred to another department and  Collazo was locked out\r\nof her office without warning.  Collazo's husband, who was  a NPP\r\nunit chairman, and  her daughter, were also dismissed  from their\r\npositions with the City in 1985-86.\r\n\r\n                                17\r\n\r\n     3.   Maria Colon de Jesus\r\n                              \r\n\r\n          Ms. Colon was dismissed from her \"regular\" position, as\r\n\r\na Messenger, in July 1985.   The letter of dismissal stated  that\r\n\r\nthe  City's  messenger  service,  with  forty-two employees,  was\r\n\r\n\"excessive and  unnecessary,\"  that it  must  be reduced  to  ten\r\n\r\nemployees as an economy measure, and that the ten employees to be\r\n\r\nretained  had been  chosen based  on an  evaluation of  their job\r\n\r\nperformance and seniority.\r\n\r\n          Ms.  Colon conceded  that  the reduction  in force  did\r\n\r\noccur as defendants indicated, and that she lacked the  requisite\r\n\r\nseniority to qualify for one of the ten remaining positions.  She\r\n\r\npoints  to no  particular  discriminatory conduct,  nor does  she\r\n\r\ncontend that (1)  messengers with less seniority or lower perfor-\r\n\r\nmance ratings were retained,9  (2) the City needed more  than ten\r\n\r\nmessengers in 1985, or (3) defendants replaced any of the thirty-\r\n\r\ntwo dismissed  messengers.  As Colon's  political affiliation and\r\n\r\nthe timing of  her dismissal were the only  significant probative\r\n\r\nevidence  supporting her  claim,10  and there  was  no direct  or\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     9While conceding that she was among the dismissed messengers\r\nwith  the  least seniority,  Colon  nonetheless  argues that  the\r\n                \r\nselection criteria were suspect because Commonwealth law requires\r\nthat  reductions  in force  be justified  first  on the  basis of\r\nemployee performance ratings, and  only then on seniority consid-\r\nerations.  See Delbrey  v. Municipio de Carolina, 111  P.R.R. 492\r\n                                                \r\n(1984).   The  record  indicates, however,  that defendants  made\r\ntheir selections  only after  \"considering the criteria  of effi-\r\n                                                                 \r\nciency in the  performance of  messenger duties and  the time  of\r\n      \r\nservices rendered in that capacity.\" (Emphasis added.)\r\n\r\n     10In view of Colon's  concession that she lacked  the requi-\r\nsite seniority, the other  circumstantial evidence was altogether\r\ntoo  weak to  vault  the initial  Mt.  Healthy hurdle.    Colon's\r\n                                              \r\npolitical participation was much  less frequent and activist than\r\n\r\n                                18\r\n\r\ncircumstantial  evidence of  pretext,  the  burden of  persuasion\r\n\r\nnever shifted to defendants.  As no factual dispute was generated\r\n\r\nconcerning the  legitimacy of the austerity  measures, or Colon's\r\n\r\nfailure to  meet the  criteria for  retention, the verdict  could\r\n\r\nonly have been based on conjecture that Colon would not have been\r\n\r\nterminated  but for  her political  affiliation. See  Ferrer, 914\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\nF.2d  at 311 (\"plaintiff is  not entitled to  inferences based on\r\n\r\nspeculation and conjecture\").11\r\n\r\n     4.   Hector L. Encarnacion Matos\r\n                                     \r\n\r\n          Encarnacion was dismissed  from his \"regular\" position,\r\n\r\nas  a Computer Operator I, in  August 1985.  The dismissal letter\r\n\r\nstated  that he lacked  the minimum qualifications  for the posi-\r\n\r\ntion, which  defendants characterized at  trial and on  appeal as\r\n\r\nrequiring an \"associate degree\"  in accounting or computer opera-\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\nmost other  appellants.   According to her  undisputed testimony,\r\nshe merely  participated  \"at  the  polling places,  and  on  the\r\nmarches  in [her] spare time,\"  and served as  \"secretary for the\r\nelectoral board\" in 1984.\r\n\r\n     11There are important public  policy considerations at stake\r\nin  these circumstances.    First, legitimate  efforts by  newly-\r\nelected  officials to  impose  fiscal constraints  and to  foster\r\noperating efficiencies should not be hamstrung.  See Marin-Piazza\r\n                                                                 \r\nv. Aponte-Roque, 873  F.2d 432,  434 (1st Cir.  1989) (\"[W]e  are\r\n               \r\ninclined  to give a certain  amount of leeway  to personnel deci-\r\nsions of new administration  officials which implement a facially\r\npolitically  neutral reorganization of structure or procedure.\").\r\nNewly-elected officials, however well meaning, might be  deterred\r\nfrom  needed measures  to  effect economies  and efficiencies  in\r\ngovernmental  operations if  a  discharged  employee's  political\r\naffiliation alone were  enough to  carry her claim  to the  jury.\r\nSecond, though  there was  ample opportunity  to raise  a genuine\r\nfactual  dispute  regarding  the  legitimacy  of the  defendants'\r\n\"austerity\" program, the  defendants demonstrated, without rebut-\r\n                                                                 \r\ntal,  that the City  has operated for  at least six  years with a\r\n   \r\nvastly streamlined messenger staff.\r\n\r\n                                19\r\n\r\ntion.

Moreover, although Encar-\r\n\r\nnacion conceded  at trial that his  post-secondary school courses\r\n\r\nwere not in accounting or programming, and that he had  no exper-\r\n\r\nience in computer  programming prior to  his appointment, he  had\r\n                                                        \r\n\r\nacquired two years' working  experience on the job before  he was\r\n\r\ndismissed  in 1985,  during  which time  he had  received several\r\n\r\n\"excellent\"  job  performance evaluations.    See  id. at  312-13\r\n                                                      \r\n\r\n(noting  that jury  could  credit  circumstantial  evidence  that\r\n\r\nplaintiff \"performed  her duties very  well\"); Estrada-Izquierdo,\r\n                                                                \r\n\r\n850 F.2d  at 14 (finding \"probative\"  the circumstantial evidence\r\n\r\nthat  plaintiff  \"successfully  carried  out her  job\"  for  many\r\n\r\nyears).

Maria de Lourdes Escute-Levest\r\n                                        \r\n\r\n          Ms.  Escute-Levest was  dismissed  from  her  \"regular\"\r\n\r\nposition,  as a Computer Operator I, in October 1985.  Initially,\r\n\r\ndefendants  contended   that  she  was  unqualified,   but  later\r\n\r\nretreated to  their \"nullity  of appointment\"  justification when\r\n\r\n                                20\r\n\r\nshe  protested that  she  had  an  associate degree  in  computer\r\n\r\nprogramming.  See supra note  5.  Escute, a member of  the former\r\n                       \r\n\r\nmayor's \"advance  team,\" testified at trial     without objection\r\n\r\nas to  the basis  of her  knowledge12     that  her position  was\r\n\r\nrefilled following her dismissal, suggesting  that it was not  as\r\n\r\nexpendable  as  defendants contend  on  appeal.   The  cumulative\r\n\r\ncircumstantial evidence  of discriminatory animus and pretext was\r\n\r\nsufficient to shift the burden of persuasion to defendants and to\r\n\r\nsupport the jury verdict.\r\n\r\n     6.   Jesus Garcia Delgado\r\n                              \r\n\r\n          Garcia was dismissed from  his \"regular\" position, as a\r\n\r\nComputer Operator I, in November 1985.  Defendants contended that\r\n\r\nGarcia, who  possessed an  associate degree in  computer program-\r\n\r\nming, did not have the required year of experience in  a \"related\r\n\r\nfield\" at  the time he  was appointed in 1978.   Even so,  he had\r\n\r\naccumulated seven years' experience by the time he was dismissed,\r\n\r\nand  plainly met all qualifications  for the position long before\r\n\r\nhis dismissal.  As the jury could have inferred that the justifi-\r\n\r\ncation offered for the dismissal was pretextual, there was enough\r\n\r\nevidence to shift the burden of persuasion to defendants.\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     12At  oral argument,  defendants contended  that plaintiffs'\r\ntrial testimony  regarding their replacements was  too conclusory\r\nand lacked factual foundation.  However, at trial the defense did\r\nnot object  to plaintiffs' testimony based on lack of foundation.\r\nThus, the jury was entitled to  resolve these issues on the basis\r\nof its  credibility determinations and weighing  of the evidence.\r\nAs the  evidence was not challenged at  trial, and there has been\r\nno showing of \"plain error,\"  Doty v. Sewall, 908 F.2d 1053, 1057\r\n                                            \r\n(1st Cir. 1990), we reject their claim on appeal.\r\n\r\n                                21\r\n\r\n     7.   Victor M. Guadalupe Bobonis\r\n                                     \r\n\r\n          Guadalupe was  dismissed for  the second time  from his\r\n\r\n\"transitory\" position, as a municipal guard, in October 1985.  In\r\n\r\nJanuary  1985,  the occasion  of  the first  dismissal,  the only\r\n\r\njustifications  defendants  offered  were  that   his  transitory\r\n\r\nappointment  had  already  lapsed  and the  position  was  deemed\r\n\r\nexpendable under the \"austerity\"  program.  Mayor Aponte abruptly\r\n\r\nrescinded the first  dismissal letter  on January 25,  1985.   In\r\n\r\nJune  1985, however,  Aponte  sent another  letter of  dismissal,\r\n\r\nasserting that Guadalupe did  not meet the minimum qualifications\r\n\r\nfor the position, and that his original appointment therefore had\r\n\r\nbeen illegal.  As  there was no  evidence that Guadalupe did  not\r\n\r\nmeet the  minimum job  qualifications, the jury  reasonably could\r\n\r\nhave  concluded  that  defendants'  shifting  justifications  for\r\n\r\nGuadalupe's dismissal amounted to pretextual posturing.\r\n\r\n          Furthermore, Guadalupe testified that twelve or fifteen\r\n\r\nmore  policemen were  hired after  his  dismissal.   See Nereida-\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nGonzalez, 990 F.2d  at 706 (noting that  evidence suggesting that\r\n        \r\n\r\ndefendants' reorganization was a  \"sham\" may be considered proba-\r\n\r\ntive of discriminatory  animus); Ferrer, 914 F.2d  at 311 (\"over-\r\n                                       \r\n\r\nstaffing\"  defense undermined  by competent  evidence  from which\r\n\r\njury could  conclude that defendants later  hired replacements to\r\n\r\nperform  same functions  entailed by  plaintiff's position);  see\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nalso supra note 12.\r\n          \r\n\r\n     8.   Ada N. Perez Colon\r\n                            \r\n\r\n                                22\r\n\r\n          Ms. Perez was dismissed from her \"regular\" position, as\r\n\r\nan Executive Officer I, in  September 1985.  Defendants contended\r\n\r\nthat she was not qualified, and alleged that she had taken an un-\r\n\r\nauthorized  medical leave, without pay,  to undergo surgery.  The\r\n\r\nExecutive Officer I position  requires a four-year college degree\r\n\r\nand administrative or  supervisory experience, or  an \"equivalent\r\n\r\ncombination of  academic background and experience.\"   Perez, who\r\n\r\nwas a member of  the former mayor's \"advance team,\"  had attended\r\n\r\ncollege for two years, and had  worked for the City since 1980 as\r\n                                                              \r\n\r\nan officer for  the CETA program and  a coordinator at  the Human\r\n\r\nResources  Department.   Thus,  the  jury  reasonably could  have\r\n\r\ndetermined that her five-year City work experience was sufficient\r\n\r\nto  offset the two-year deficit in education.   See supra note 7.\r\n                                                         \r\n\r\nThe jury therefore was free to conclude  that both justifications\r\n\r\nfor her dismissal were pretextual.\r\n\r\n     9.   Evelyn Quinones Osorio\r\n                                \r\n\r\n          Ms. Quinones was dismissed from her \"regular\" position,\r\n\r\nas an Executive  Secretary III,  in September 1985.   Within  two\r\n\r\nweeks after taking office, Mayor Aponte called all mayor's office\r\n\r\nemployees together and advised  that they were \"persons  who were\r\n\r\nin trust to the former mayor,\" and that they would be replaced or\r\n\r\ntransferred in  \"due time.\"   Defendant  Martinez also  told Qui-\r\n\r\nnones,  a member of the  former mayor's \"advance  team,\" that she\r\n\r\n\"didn't have  his trust.\"   After training her  replacement, Qui-\r\n\r\nnones accepted a transfer out of the mayor's office.   She testi-\r\n\r\nfied that  officials of  the new  administration erased her  time\r\n\r\n                                23\r\n\r\ncards  and, on one occasion, retained her paycheck for six weeks.\r\n\r\nDefendant  Martinez,  City  personnel  officer,   told  Quinones:\r\n\r\n\"[T]hose are injustices but I follow orders from above.\"  (Empha-\r\n                                                      \r\n\r\nsis added.) \r\n\r\n          In July 1985, after Quinones'  brief tenure in the  new\r\n\r\nsecretarial position,  Aponte notified her that she would be ter-\r\n\r\nminated  because she was unqualified for the position.  The rele-\r\n\r\nvant job  description called  for a two-year  secretarial course,\r\n\r\nand four  years' secretarial  experience, but  two years  of work\r\n\r\nexperience could be substituted for educational experience.  When\r\n\r\nQuinones  provided satisfactory documentation  of her educational\r\n\r\nqualifications,  defendants fell  back on  their \"nullity  of ap-\r\n\r\npointment\"  defense as  the sole  ground for  her  September 1985\r\n\r\ndismissal.   See supra note  5.  Moreover,  Osario testified that\r\n                      \r\n\r\nshe had worked  as a secretary since 1980, and  her final year as\r\n\r\nan  Executive  Secretary III  clearly qualified  her for  her new\r\n\r\nposition.  Thus, Quinones presented sufficient direct and circum-\r\n\r\nstantial evidence  of discriminatory animus and  pretext to shift\r\n\r\nthe burden of persuasion. \r\n\r\n     10.  Carmen Rivera Guadalupe\r\n                                 \r\n\r\n          Ms. Rivera Guadalupe was dismissed from  her \"transito-\r\n\r\nry\" positions,  as Child  Care worker  and Secretary,  in January\r\n\r\n1986.  She was notified that she was being terminated because her\r\n\r\ntransitory appointment had  lapsed, and the City  could no longer\r\n\r\nafford to  fund the position.  Her  husband continued to work for\r\n\r\nthe  Aponte administration for another  five or six  years.  Like\r\n\r\n                                24\r\n\r\nplaintiff Colon, Ms. Rivera offered no evidence that the elimina-\r\n\r\ntion of  her position was in any way pretextual, nor that she was\r\n\r\never replaced, let alone by a PDP member.   As political affilia-\r\n\r\ntion and the timing of the dismissal were insufficient to satisfy\r\n\r\nher  threshold burden of  production,13 the jury  verdict must be\r\n\r\nset aside as conjectural.\r\n\r\n     11.  Luisa Rivera Serrano\r\n                              \r\n\r\n          Ms. Rivera Serrano was dismissed from her  \"transitory\"\r\n\r\nposition,  as a Clerk I,  in August 1985,  ostensibly because her\r\n\r\nfixed  term of employment had expired.  Although the jury reason-\r\n\r\nably  could have  inferred that  her position,  like that  of Ms.\r\n\r\nRivera Guadalupe,  would be eliminated on  austerity grounds, the\r\n\r\nimplicit rationale for her dismissal was undermined by Ms. Rivera\r\n\r\nSerrano's testimony that she  was replaced by Rosa Mattos,  a PDP\r\n\r\nmember.  Defendants' attempt  to undermine Rivera's testimony, by\r\n\r\nnoting  that she  previously  had identified  a different  person\r\n\r\n(Inez) as her replacement, fails.  Not only are we precluded from\r\n\r\ncredibility determinations, see Hendricks  &amp; Assocs., 923 F.2d at\r\n                                                    \r\n\r\n214, but Rivera offered a plausible explanation for her inconsis-\r\n\r\ntent responses:   both individuals applied  for her former  posi-\r\n\r\ntion.  As  there was ample basis for a  reasonable inference that\r\n\r\nthe proffered ground  for the dismissal was  pretextual, the jury\r\n\r\nverdict must be upheld.\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     13Like Ms.  Colon, see  supra text accompanying  notes 9-11,\r\n                                  \r\nMs. Rivera's NPP activities were peripheral and relatively incon-\r\nspicuous.   She served as a polling unit officer for the NPP, and\r\nchaired the NPP Womens' Movement at her local union.\r\n\r\n                                25\r\n\r\n                            CONCLUSION\r\n                                      \r\n\r\n          We acknowledge the careful attention the district court\r\n\r\nhas given  the evidence in this  case.14  In the  Rule 50(b) con-\r\n\r\ntext, however,  we are required  to recognize that  evidence does\r\n\r\nnot  pass through the jury  \"lens\" unrefracted.   Our review con-\r\n\r\nvinces us  that these  jury verdicts,  with two  exceptions, must\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     14In  February 1992,  the district court  denied defendants'\r\nfirst Rule  50(b) motion.  After carefully  reviewing its \"notes,\r\ndefense  arguments and  the jury  verdicts,\" the court  based its\r\nruling on the  fact that \"the jury  individually and meticulously\r\nconsidered each [of the 255] claim[s].\"   The  closeness of these\r\nquestions is  demonstrated by the district  court's equally pain-\r\nstaking reconsideration, as well as our own review.\r\n     We nevertheless reject plaintiffs' appeals from the district\r\ncourt ruling denying their reinstatement.  A denial of reinstate-\r\nment is  reviewed for \"abuse of  discretion,\" Hiraldo-Cancel, 925\r\n                                                            \r\nF.2d at 13, and we will reverse \"only if  we are left with a firm\r\nconviction that [the district  court] has committed 'a meaningful\r\nerror in judgment.'\"  Rosario-Torres, 889 F.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir.\r\n                                    \r\n1989) (en banc) (quoting Anderson v.

After assiduously  weighing\r\nthe  equities,  the  district  court rejected  the  reinstatement\r\nclaims  on several  sustainable grounds.   First,  federally com-\r\npelled  reinstatements to  municipal positions  implicate serious\r\ncomity  and  federalism  concerns,  especially in  light  of  the\r\ncompelling evidence  that plaintiffs' appointments  were made  in\r\nblatant  disregard of  Commonwealth and  municipal personnel  and\r\nelectoral  laws, and  that the  City was  operating under  severe\r\nfiscal  constraints, both  at the  time of  the dismissals.   Id.\r\n                                                                 \r\n(noting that, \"[i]n shaping  equitable remedies, comity  concerns\r\ncan loom  large,\" and that \"court-ordered  reinstatement of ille-\r\ngally-hired . .  . workers strikes a particularly jarring note\").\r\nSecond, significant periods of  time elapsed after their dismiss-\r\nals before plaintiffs requested injunctive  relief.  Id. at  324.\r\n                                                       \r\nFinally, some of the harshness inherent in a refusal to reinstate\r\nis  diminished where  the employee  has been  awarded significant\r\nmonetary  relief.   See  Rosario-Torres,  889  F.2d at  322,  324\r\n                                       \r\n(contrasting Title VII  cases, which  do not  permit recovery  of\r\ncompensatory or punitive damages,  with First Amendment political\r\ndiscrimination cases, which offer  a fuller \"palette of available\r\nmake-whole remedies\" to offset a denial of reinstatement).\r\n\r\n                                26\r\n\r\ntherefore be reinstated.15\r\n\r\n          Judgment in accordance with  the verdicts must be rein-\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nstated for all appellants,  with the exception of Maria  Colon de\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nJesus  and Carmen Rivera Guadalupe.   In all  other respects, the\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\ndistrict court judgment is affirmed.

We  reject this contention.   A  facially\r\ninconsistent verdict in a  civil action    no rare  phenomenon   \r\nis  not an automatic ground for  vacating the verdict.  See Fair-\r\n                                                                 \r\nmount Glass Works v. Cub Fork Coal Co., 287 U.S. 474, 485 (1933).\r\n                                      \r\nThe  court \"must  attempt to  reconcile the  jury's findings,  by\r\nexegesis if  necessary  . . . before  [it is]  free to  disregard\r\n[them].\"   Gallick v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio  R. Co., 372 U.S. 108, 119\r\n                                              \r\n(1963).\r\n     Here,  the  findings are  readily  reconcilable.   The  jury\r\ncharge, to which there was no  relevant objection, suggested that\r\nAponte's liability and the municipality's liability could go hand\r\nin hand.  Since the special verdict form did not specify the need\r\nfor dual findings on  liability, the jury may have  reasoned that\r\nbranding the City \"liable\"  necessarily incorporated a finding of\r\nAponte's liability as well.   Accordingly, in view of  the jury's\r\nclear imposition of liability for punitive damages on Aponte,  we\r\ncannot conclude that the verdict    naming only the City \"liable\"\r\nfor  discrimination      unambiguously  or  completely exonerated\r\nAponte.  Compare DeFeliciano  v. DeJesus, 873 F.2d 447,  452 (1st\r\n                                        \r\nCir.)

During his first\r\n\r\nyear in office,  Mayor Aponte  either terminated,  or refused  to\r\n\r\nrenew,  several  hundred  non-policymaking  city  employees hired\r\n\r\nunder the  previous administration.   In letters of  dismissal to\r\n\r\nthe employees, Aponte claimed that the City faced a severe fiscal\r\n\r\ncrisis, and  disclosed  various criteria  for  determining  which\r\n\r\nmunicipal  employees were to be terminated in order to effect the\r\n\r\nnecessary economies:\r\n\r\n          (1)  employees hired  without compliance with\r\n               Commonwealth or municipal personnel laws\r\n               and  regulations,  see, e.g.,  P.R. Laws\r\n                                           \r\n               Ann. tit. 3,    1331-1337, which dictate\r\n               the  public  posting of  available posi-\r\n               tions and competitive examinations;\r\n\r\n          (2)  employees hired or  promoted during  the\r\n               1984  \"veda,\" or  \"electoral prohibition\r\n               period,\"  a  four-month \"window\"  before\r\n               and  after  a municipal  election during\r\n               which hiring, renewals, or promotions by\r\n               the  incumbent  administration are  pro-\r\n               scribed by law;\r\n\r\n          (3)  employees  who submitted  no documentary\r\n               proof  that  they possessed  the minimum\r\n               education  and  experience required  for\r\n               their positions; \r\n\r\n          (4)  employees   whose  job   positions  were\r\n               deemed  nonessential, and  therefore ex-\r\n               pendable; or\r\n\r\n                                3\r\n\r\n          (5)  employees  who had  committed employment\r\n               infractions  (e.g., unexcused  leaves of\r\n                                 \r\n               absence, chronic tardiness).\r\n\r\n          In March 1986, 357 terminated employees, claiming poli-\r\n\r\ntical affiliation with  the ousted NPP, brought the present civil\r\n\r\nrights action  under  42 U.S.C.    1983 against  the City,  Mayor\r\n\r\nAponte, Jose A. del Valle (at times, the acting mayor), and Felix\r\n\r\nMartinez (the personnel officer).   Plaintiffs alleged that their\r\n\r\ndismissals were due solely to their NPP affiliation, in violation\r\n\r\nof  their First Amendment and due process rights under the United\r\n\r\nStates  Constitution.   The  complaint demanded  compensatory and\r\n\r\npunitive damages, as well as reinstatement.1\r\n\r\n          The claims of 255 plaintiffs went to the jury following\r\n\r\na  four-month trial, and defendant  verdicts were returned on the\r\n\r\nclaims  of 240 plaintiffs.   Six plaintiffs  were awarded compen-\r\n\r\nsatory damages  (from $1700  to $10,440)  against  the City,  and\r\n\r\npunitive damages ($25,000) against  Aponte, while nine plaintiffs\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     1Three  municipal employee classifications  were involved in\r\nthe challenged terminations:  (1) \"regular\" employees,  occupying\r\npermanent  or   career  municipal  positions,   (2)  \"transitory\"\r\nemployees,  appointed  without  the  usual   personnel  screening\r\nprocedures  (e.g.,  postings and  competitive  examinations), but\r\n                 \r\nsubject to  periodic renewals at  the expiration  of their  fixed\r\nterms, and (3) \"contractual\" workers, hired for fixed terms under\r\nfederally funded  programs (e.g., HUD) administered  by the City.\r\n                                \r\n\"Transitory\" employees  lack tenure, or  a reasonable expectation\r\nin  the indefinite  continuation  of their  employment after  the\r\nexpiration of their fixed term.   While their lack of  a property\r\ninterest in their  employment positions  generally precludes  due\r\nprocess claims  for a politically discriminatory dismissal, First\r\nAmendment discrimination claims are not precluded.

The \"Austerity\" Defense\r\n                            \r\n\r\n          Through  numerous  expert  witnesses   and  statistical\r\n\r\ndata,4   defendants  attempted to  establish that  all the  chal-\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     4For  example,  defendants  presented  the  following uncon-\r\ntroverted evidence:  1)  in 1985, there were  approximately 2,900\r\nCity employees, including 906 \"transitory\" employees, 459 of whom\r\nhad  been appointed by  the former administration  in fiscal year\r\n1984 alone;  2) the  former mayor  had made 250-300  appointments\r\nbetween July and October 1984; 3) in 1984, despite warnings about\r\nthe City's worsening budgetary problems, the former mayor renewed\r\nall transitory employees' expiring  appointments; 4) by 1985, the\r\n   \r\npersonnel payroll comprised 80% of the City's budget; 5) in 1985,\r\ndefendant  Aponte inherited  a debt  of $116  million, which  has\r\nsince  been reduced to $30 million, and an accumulated deficit of\r\n$30 million,  since reduced to $3 million;  and 6) by 1991, there\r\nwere 1,966 City  employees, only eight of whom  were \"transitory\"\r\nemployees. \r\n\r\n                                9\r\n\r\nlenged dismissals  were due  to  the fiscal  crisis inherited  by\r\n\r\nMayor  Aponte when he took  office in 1985,  which the defendants\r\n\r\nattributed to mismanagement or illegal patronage hiring practices\r\n\r\non  the part of the previous administration.  The jury reasonably\r\n\r\ncould  have found that the dismissals made by the incoming admin-\r\n\r\nistration resulted  in a 32%  net reduction of  approximately 900\r\n\r\nCity employees (from 2,869  to 1,966), and that no  new employees\r\n\r\nwere hired  to perform  the duties of  the dismissed  plaintiffs.\r\n\r\nThus, the jury reasonably  could have concluded that a  bona fide\r\n\r\nfiscal  crisis  would have  compelled  the vast  majority  of the\r\n\r\nchallenged dismissals even if the targeted employees had not been\r\n\r\naffiliated with the NPP.                Defendants' well-deployed\r\n\r\n\"austerity\" defense apparently  thwarted the claims of 240 of the\r\n\r\n255 plaintiffs whose cases went  to the jury.  But blunt  instru-\r\n\r\nments make crude scalpels,  and the Mt. Healthy defense  requires\r\n                                               \r\n\r\nindividualized  scrutiny by  the jury  with a  view to  whether a\r\n\r\nparticular plaintiff's position would have  been eliminated under\r\n\r\nAponte's austerity  program but for the  plaintiff's NPP affilia-\r\n                                   \r\n\r\ntion.    In  other  words, even  though  defendants'  overarching\r\n\r\nausterity  defense may  have established that  massive dismissals\r\n\r\nwere imperative, it did  not compel jury verdicts adverse  to all\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nplaintiffs.

First, to the extent the reasons given by the employ-\r\n\r\ner at the time of the  dismissal are later proven false or frivo-\r\n\r\nlous,  the weight of the evidence of discriminatory animus may be\r\n\r\nenhanced, thereby contributing significantly to the threshold Mt.\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nHealthy  showing the  plaintiff-employee  must make  in order  to\r\n       \r\n\r\nshift the ultimate burden  of persuasion to the defendant-employ-\r\n\r\n                                11\r\n\r\ner.   Second, once  the burden of  persuasion has shifted  to the\r\n\r\nemployer, the jury would  be entitled to find for  the plaintiff-\r\n\r\nemployee  were it  to conclude  that the  employer did  not offer\r\n\r\nsufficient evidence to demonstrate  that (i) the proffered reason\r\n\r\nfor the dismissal  was genuine or (ii) a bona  fide basis existed\r\n                                 \r\n\r\nwhich  would have  prompted the  dismissal without regard  to the\r\n\r\nemployee's political affiliation.

We do  not suggest,\r\n                         \r\nhowever,  that  evidence  relating  to  the  plaintiff-employee's\r\n                        \r\nqualifications  under  the  applicable personnel  regulations  is\r\nimmaterial.   For example,  an employee's lack  of qualifications\r\nfor  the position,  at the  time of  the  dismissal, may  well be\r\n                                                   \r\nconsidered a nondiscriminatory basis for the dismissal.

Brenda Aponte Osorio\r\n                              \r\n\r\n          Ms.  Aponte was dismissed  from her \"regular\" position,\r\n\r\nas an  Executive Officer IV, in  May 1985.  In  addition to other\r\n\r\ndirect evidence of discriminatory animus,6 the letter of dismiss-\r\n\r\nal  from Mayor Aponte stated  that Ms. Aponte  apparently did not\r\n\r\npossess the qualifications for her  position    in particular,  a\r\n\r\ncollege degree  and \"considerable\" relevant work  experience.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the written  job description  for an  Executive Officer  IV\r\n\r\nlists a  college degree as \"desirable  preparation,\" but provides\r\n\r\nthat a \"combination of preparation and experience will be accept-\r\n\r\nable\"; it  defines  \"experience\"  as  \"positions  of  progressive\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     6Ms. Aponte states that she was constructively dismissed one\r\nday after the new administration took office, when she was denied\r\naccess to  her office, told that she was \"not a person of trust,\"\r\nand given no further duties.  Her protests went unanswered.\r\n\r\n                                15\r\n\r\nresponsibility . . .  in the public service,  including consider-\r\n\r\nable  administrative  or  supervision  experience.\"     (Emphasis\r\n                                                 \r\n\r\nadded.)  At trial, Ms. Aponte testified that she attended college\r\n\r\nfor  three years,  and began working  for the  City in  1978 as a\r\n\r\nsupervisor in the Human Resources Department.7\r\n          \r\n\r\n          Ms.  Aponte presented  sufficient evidence to  enable a\r\n\r\njury to find that she possessed the required qualifications, both\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nat the  time of her  appointment and  dismissal.

As there was no conclusive evidence that Ms. Aponte\r\n\r\nwould have been  dismissed in any  event for a  nondiscriminatory\r\n\r\nreason, the jury verdict must be sustained.\r\n\r\n     2.   Dorotea Collazo Rivera\r\n                                \r\n\r\n          Ms. Collazo  was dismissed from her \"regular\" position,\r\n\r\nas an Administrative Assistant I, in January 1986.8  The dismiss-\r\n\r\nal letter  asserted that  Collazo's termination was  based on  an\r\n\r\nabsence of evidence that she was ever qualified for her position.\r\n\r\nHowever, Collazo's job description merely required  a \"desirable\"\r\n\r\n(high  school  diploma)  education/experience   (\"general  office\r\n\r\nwork\") mix.  Collazo  testified that she met the  posted academic\r\n\r\npreparation component  of the  job description.   Moreover, there\r\n\r\nwas  no  dispute that  Collazo, who  was  appointed to  her final\r\n                                                                 \r\n\r\nposition with the City  in 1981, previously had been  employed as\r\n        \r\n\r\nan  office clerk for the City since 1976.  Thus, Collazo likewise\r\n                                        \r\n\r\nsucceeded in shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendants,\r\n\r\nand defendants simply failed to persuade the jury.\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     8When the  new administration took over, Collazo's secretary\r\nwas transferred to another department and  Collazo was locked out\r\nof her office without warning.  Collazo's husband, who was  a NPP\r\nunit chairman, and  her daughter, were also dismissed  from their\r\npositions with the City in 1985-86.\r\n\r\n                                17\r\n\r\n     3.   Maria Colon de Jesus\r\n                              \r\n\r\n          Ms. Colon was dismissed from her \"regular\" position, as\r\n\r\na Messenger, in July 1985.   The letter of dismissal stated  that\r\n\r\nthe  City's  messenger  service,  with  forty-two employees,  was\r\n\r\n\"excessive and  unnecessary,\"  that it  must  be reduced  to  ten\r\n\r\nemployees as an economy measure, and that the ten employees to be\r\n\r\nretained  had been  chosen based  on an  evaluation of  their job\r\n\r\nperformance and seniority.\r\n\r\n          Ms.  Colon conceded  that  the reduction  in force  did\r\n\r\noccur as defendants indicated, and that she lacked the  requisite\r\n\r\nseniority to qualify for one of the ten remaining positions.  She\r\n\r\npoints  to no  particular  discriminatory conduct,  nor does  she\r\n\r\ncontend that (1)  messengers with less seniority or lower perfor-\r\n\r\nmance ratings were retained,9  (2) the City needed more  than ten\r\n\r\nmessengers in 1985, or (3) defendants replaced any of the thirty-\r\n\r\ntwo dismissed  messengers.  As Colon's  political affiliation and\r\n\r\nthe timing of  her dismissal were the only  significant probative\r\n\r\nevidence  supporting her  claim,10  and there  was  no direct  or\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n     9While conceding that she was among the dismissed messengers\r\nwith  the  least seniority,  Colon  nonetheless  argues that  the\r\n                \r\nselection criteria were suspect because Commonwealth law requires\r\nthat  reductions  in force  be justified  first  on the  basis of\r\nemployee performance ratings, and  only then on seniority consid-\r\nerations.

In\r\n\r\nJanuary  1985,  the occasion  of  the first  dismissal,  the only\r\n\r\njustifications  defendants  offered  were  that   his  transitory\r\n\r\nappointment  had  already  lapsed  and the  position  was  deemed\r\n\r\nexpendable under the \"austerity\"  program.  Mayor Aponte abruptly\r\n\r\nrescinded the first  dismissal letter  on January 25,  1985.   In\r\n\r\nJune  1985, however,  Aponte  sent another  letter of  dismissal,\r\n\r\nasserting that Guadalupe did  not meet the minimum qualifications\r\n\r\nfor the position, and that his original appointment therefore had\r\n\r\nbeen illegal.

Defendants contended\r\n\r\nthat she was not qualified, and alleged that she had taken an un-\r\n\r\nauthorized  medical leave, without pay,  to undergo surgery.  The\r\n\r\nExecutive Officer I position  requires a four-year college degree\r\n\r\nand administrative or  supervisory experience, or  an \"equivalent\r\n\r\ncombination of  academic background and experience.\"   Perez, who\r\n\r\nwas a member of  the former mayor's \"advance team,\"  had attended\r\n\r\ncollege for two years, and had  worked for the City since 1980 as\r\n                                                              \r\n\r\nan officer for  the CETA program and  a coordinator at  the Human\r\n\r\nResources  Department.   Thus,  the  jury  reasonably could  have\r\n\r\ndetermined that her five-year City work experience was sufficient\r\n\r\nto  offset the two-year deficit in education.   See supra note 7.\r\n                                                         \r\n\r\nThe jury therefore was free to conclude  that both justifications\r\n\r\nfor her dismissal were pretextual.\r\n\r\n     9.   Evelyn Quinones Osorio\r\n                                \r\n\r\n          Ms. Quinones was dismissed from her \"regular\" position,\r\n\r\nas an Executive  Secretary III,  in September 1985.   Within  two\r\n\r\nweeks after taking office, Mayor Aponte called all mayor's office\r\n\r\nemployees together and advised  that they were \"persons  who were\r\n\r\nin trust to the former mayor,\" and that they would be replaced or\r\n\r\ntransferred in  \"due time.\"   Defendant  Martinez also  told Qui-\r\n\r\nnones,  a member of the  former mayor's \"advance  team,\" that she\r\n\r\n\"didn't have  his trust.\"   After training her  replacement, Qui-\r\n\r\nnones accepted a transfer out of the mayor's office.   She testi-\r\n\r\nfied that  officials of  the new  administration erased her  time\r\n\r\n                                23\r\n\r\ncards  and, on one occasion, retained her paycheck for six weeks.\r\n\r\nDefendant  Martinez,  City  personnel  officer,   told  Quinones:\r\n\r\n\"[T]hose are injustices but I follow orders from above.\"  (Empha-\r\n                                                      \r\n\r\nsis added.) \r\n\r\n          In July 1985, after Quinones'  brief tenure in the  new\r\n\r\nsecretarial position,  Aponte notified her that she would be ter-\r\n\r\nminated  because she was unqualified for the position.  The rele-\r\n\r\nvant job  description called  for a two-year  secretarial course,\r\n\r\nand four  years' secretarial  experience, but  two years  of work\r\n\r\nexperience could be substituted for educational experience.  When\r\n\r\nQuinones  provided satisfactory documentation  of her educational\r\n\r\nqualifications,  defendants fell  back on  their \"nullity  of ap-\r\n\r\npointment\"  defense as  the sole  ground for  her  September 1985\r\n\r\ndismissal.   See supra note  5.  Moreover,  Osario testified that\r\n                      \r\n\r\nshe had worked  as a secretary since 1980, and  her final year as\r\n\r\nan  Executive  Secretary III  clearly qualified  her for  her new\r\n\r\nposition.  Thus, Quinones presented sufficient direct and circum-\r\n\r\nstantial evidence  of discriminatory animus and  pretext to shift\r\n\r\nthe burden of persuasion. \r\n\r\n     10.  Carmen Rivera Guadalupe\r\n                                 \r\n\r\n          Ms. Rivera Guadalupe was dismissed from  her \"transito-\r\n\r\nry\" positions,  as Child  Care worker  and Secretary,  in January\r\n\r\n1986.  She was notified that she was being terminated because her\r\n\r\ntransitory appointment had  lapsed, and the City  could no longer\r\n\r\nafford to  fund the position.  Her  husband continued to work for\r\n\r\nthe  Aponte administration for another  five or six  years.  Like\r\n\r\n                                24\r\n\r\nplaintiff Colon, Ms. Rivera offered no evidence that the elimina-\r\n\r\ntion of  her position was in any way pretextual, nor that she was\r\n\r\never replaced, let alone by a PDP member.   As political affilia-\r\n\r\ntion and the timing of the dismissal were insufficient to satisfy\r\n\r\nher  threshold burden of  production,13 the jury  verdict must be\r\n\r\nset aside as conjectural.\r\n\r\n     11.  Luisa Rivera Serrano\r\n                              \r\n\r\n          Ms. Rivera Serrano was dismissed from her  \"transitory\"\r\n\r\nposition,  as a Clerk I,  in August 1985,  ostensibly because her\r\n\r\nfixed  term of employment had expired.  Although the jury reason-\r\n\r\nably  could have  inferred that  her position,  like that  of Ms.\r\n\r\nRivera Guadalupe,  would be eliminated on  austerity grounds, the\r\n\r\nimplicit rationale for her dismissal was undermined by Ms. Rivera\r\n\r\nSerrano's testimony that she  was replaced by Rosa Mattos,  a PDP\r\n\r\nmember.  Defendants' attempt  to undermine Rivera's testimony, by\r\n\r\nnoting  that she  previously  had identified  a different  person\r\n\r\n(Inez) as her replacement, fails.

The  jury\r\ncharge, to which there was no  relevant objection, suggested that\r\nAponte's liability and the municipality's liability could go hand\r\nin hand.  Since the special verdict form did not specify the need\r\nfor dual findings on  liability, the jury may have  reasoned that\r\nbranding the City \"liable\"  necessarily incorporated a finding of\r\nAponte's liability as well.   Accordingly, in view of  the jury's\r\nclear imposition of liability for punitive damages on Aponte,  we\r\ncannot conclude that the verdict    naming only the City \"liable\"\r\nfor  discrimination      unambiguously  or  completely exonerated\r\nAponte.
