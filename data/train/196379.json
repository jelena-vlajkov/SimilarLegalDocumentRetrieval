He sought damages in the amount  of $500,000\r\n\nfor alleged monetary losses, emotional and mental distress. \r\n\n          The  district  court  dismissed  the  complaint  as\r\n\nfrivolous under 28 U.S.C.   1915(d), inasmuch as the Eleventh\r\n\nAmendment indisputably bars actions for money damages against\r\n\nan arm of the Commonwealth  in the absence of a waiver.

The court  also\r\n\ndenied, as \"moot,\" a motion to amend the complaint which Ross\r\n\nfiled  almost  a month  after  the  dismissal.   This  appeal\r\n\nfollowed.1  \r\n\n          Ross  argues  that  the  court  did  not  read  his\r\n\ncomplaint liberally enough because his additional prayer, for\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.    In light of the disposition of this appeal, we need not\r\ninquire into the timeliness of Ross' challenge to the initial\r\ndismissal. \r\r\n\n\"such  other  relief as  this  court deems  fit,\"  might have\r\n\nincluded  an injunction.  He also challenges the denial of an\r\n\nopportunity to amend the complaint.\r\n\n          Dismissals  for frivolousness  under  28  U.S.C.   \r\n\n1915(d) are  reviewed only  for abuse of  discretion, \"taking\r\n\ninto  account the  liberal pleading  standards applicable  to\r\n\ncomplaints filed by pro se plaintiffs.\"  Watson v. Caton, 984\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  537, 539 (1st  Cir. 1993) (citing  Denton v.

There was  no abuse  in the  court's\r\n\nfailure to  conjure up all conceivable  unpled allegations to\r\n\nsave a legally baseless complaint.  See McDonald v.
