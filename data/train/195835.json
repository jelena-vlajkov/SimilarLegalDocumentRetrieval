Plaintiff-appellant  John  Banks has\r                                 \n\nappealed  from  the  district  court's  order  affirming  the\n\nSecretary's  denial of  Social Security  disability benefits.\n\nBecause the  district  court  issued  its  affirmance  before\n\naffording Banks  an opportunity to submit argument explaining\n\nhis objections  to the  Secretary's determination,  we remand\n\nthis case to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n          Banks  applied for  disability benefits  on January\n\n15,  1991, alleging an  inability to work due  to a number of\n\nphysical  and  mental ailments.    On October  12,  1993, the\n\nAppeals  Council  denied Banks'  request  for  review of  the\n\nfinding of  an Administrative  Law Judge  that Banks  was not\n\ndisabled.  \n\n          On  December 17,  1993, Banks  brought the  instant\n\naction  in  the District  of  Massachusetts  seeking judicial\n\nreview  of the Secretary's decision.   The Secretary filed an\n\nanswer  to  Banks'  complaint,  accompanied  by  the 767-page\n\nadministrative  record of the case,  on March 22,  1994.  One\n\nweek  later, on March 29, 1994, the district court sua sponte\n\n--  without notice  to the  parties,  and without  giving the\n\nparties  an  opportunity  to  submit  argument  --  issued  a\n\nmemorandum and order affirming the decision of the Secretary.\n\nJudgment for the Secretary was issued on that same date.\n\n          On April 11, 1994, Banks filed a motion to alter or\n\namend the  judgment under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  59(e).   In that\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmotion Banks argued  that it  was improper  for the  district\n\ncourt to enter judgment against Banks without affording Banks\n\nan  opportunity to  brief  the issues  in  the case.    Banks\n\nincluded a  proposed briefing  schedule.   On  April 14,  the\n\ndistrict  court   summarily  denied  Banks'  motion.    Banks\n\nappeals, pressing this same point.\n\n          This court has never considered the question of the\n\npropriety of  a  district court,  on review  of a  disability\n\ndetermination, affirming the  Secretary without affording the\n\nclaimant  an opportunity  to  present argument.1   The  three\n\ncircuits  that have  addressed the  issue, however,  have all\n\ndeclined to sanction the practice.  \n\n          In  Kistner v.  Califano, 579  F.2d 1004  (6th Cir.\r                                              \n\n1978), the  district court  entered summary judgment  for the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Our decision in Alameda v. Secretary of Health, Education\r                                                                         \n&amp;  Welfare, 622  F.2d  1044 (1st  Cir.  1980), cited  by  the\r                      \nSecretary, is inapposite.   There we noted, in the  course of\nruling that the  district court may enter  a default judgment\nagainst the  Secretary only  if the claimant  has established\nhis  right to  relief  by satisfactory  evidence, \"that  many\nsocial  security reviews  by  the district  court are  simple\nmatters, which can often be  resolved by reading the findings\nof the Secretary  without recourse to  a memorandum of  facts\nand law.   But  not all  social security  cases  are of  this\nnature.    Moreover,  appellant  may  have   presented  legal\narguments,  or even  assertions as  to the  new circumstances\nbearing  on the equities, which  the court will  want to have\nanswered before deciding.\"  Id. at 1047.  In this passage  we\r                                          \nwere referring to  the discretion of  the district court,  in\nthe course of affirming the Secretary, to dispense with legal\nargument  from   the  Secretary  in  response  to  claimant's\r                                           \narguments.   Our  comments  did not  refer  to or  approve  a\npractice of dismissing disability review cases without giving\nthe claimant an opportunity to state his or her objections to\nthe Secretary's determination.  \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nSecretary sua sponte, without prior notice to the parties and\n\nwithout  any opportunity  for  the claimant  to file  written\n\nargument.     The  district  court   treated  the  respective\n\npleadings  of  the  parties  \"as cross  motions  for  summary\n\njudgment.\"  Id. at 1005.  The Sixth Circuit held that Fed. R.\r                          \n\nCiv. P. 56 bars a \"sua sponte  grant [of] summary judgment to\n\none  party without  giving the  adverse party  notice  and an\n\nopportunity  to respond in opposition to the motion.\"  Id. at\r                                                                     \n\n1006.  The  court declined  to treat the  matter as  harmless\n\nerror and proceed to the merits on appeal, concluding instead\n\nthat the claimant  \"is entitled to a full and  fair review of\n\nthe Secretary's  decision denying  her claim for  benefits in\n\nthe district  court in the first  instance.\"  Id.   The court\r                                                            \n\nthus vacated  the district court's judgment  and remanded the\n\ncase to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n          In Myers v. Califano, 611 F.2d 980 (4th Cir. 1980),\r                                          \n\nthe  district court  affirmed  the Secretary's  decision  sua\n\nsponte based on nothing more than the pleadings.  In doing so\n\nthe  court relied  on 42  U.S.C.    405(g), which  allows the\n\nreviewing  court to  enter judgment  \"upon the  pleadings and\n\ntranscript  of record.\"   The  Fourth Circuit  held that  the\n\ndistrict  court's summary affirmance was nonetheless improper\n\nin  the  light of  Califano v.  Yamasaki,  442 U.S.  682, 699\r                                                    \n\n(1979),  in which the Supreme  Court held that    405(g) does\n\nnot exempt actions  for review of social security claims from\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nthe operation of  the Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure,  but\n\ninstead  \"prescribes that  judicial  review shall  be by  the\n\nusual type  of `civil  action' brought routinely  in district\n\ncourt.\"  Id.   Accordingly,  the court of  appeals ruled  the\r                       \n\ndistrict  court's  summary  affirmance   was  \"inappropriate\"\n\nbecause  the Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure entitle  the\n\nopposing party to notice and an opportunity to respond before\n\ndismissal.   The court  went on to  observe, \"[C]ourts derive\n\nsubstantial   benefit   from   briefs  and   oral   argument.\n\nGenerally, they  should require counsel's  aid in  clarifying\n\nand resolving issues.\"   Id.  Because, however,  both parties\r                                       \n\nto  the appeal nonetheless urged  the court of  appeals to go\n\nahead and decide the merits, the court did so.  Id.\r                                                              \n\n          In the third case, Flores  v. Heckler, 755 F.2d 401\r                                                           \n\n(5th  Cir.  1985),  the  district court,  similarly,  entered\n\njudgment for  the Secretary sua sponte  without affording the\n\nclaimant an opportunity to present argument.   In response to\n\nthe claimant's argument that  the district court was required\n\nto,  and had failed to, follow the  mechanism of Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.  56 in  dismissing  disability review  actions, the  Fifth\n\nCircuit  stated  that  use   of  summary  judgment,  although\n\npermissible,  was  not  required.     The  court  of  appeals\n\nindicated that  it was  unconcerned whether a  district court\n\nchose  to  proceed  under  Rule 56  or  Rule  12.   What  was\n\nimportant,  the court  of appeals  ruled, was  that \"district\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncourts   reviewing   disability  determinations   should  not\n\nconclude their review without an appropriate  opportunity for\n\nthe presentation of  the parties' contentions.\"   Id. at 403.\r                                                                \n\nThe court  of appeals  went  on to  find that  the error  was\n\nharmless  in the case before it, and proceeded to the merits,\n\nbecause  the claimant had presented his  arguments in full in\n\nhis  motion for  new trial,  and in  denying that  motion the\n\ndistrict court had \"stated that it had  reviewed `the motion,\n\nthe record, and the law.'\"  Id.  \r                                          \n\n          Like  the  Fifth Circuit  in  Flores,  we need  not\r                                                          \n\nconcern ourselves with whether  the district court's order is\n\nmore appropriately labelled and analyzed  as under Rule 12 or\n\nRule 56 of the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure.   We simply\n\nhold,  as   did  Flores,  that  \"district   courts  reviewing\r                                   \n\ndisability  determinations should  not conclude  their review\n\nwithout  an appropriate opportunity  for the  presentation of\n\nthe parties' contentions.\"  Id. at 403.  In his memorandum in\r                                           \n\nsupport of  his Rule 59(e)  motion, Banks set  forth specific\n\nobjections  to the  Secretary's determination  that, whatever\n\ntheir ultimate merit, certainly  appear substantial enough to\n\njustify an opportunity for full briefing.\n\n          We cannot  find, unlike  the court in  Flores, that\r                                                                   \n\nthe district court's error  was harmless.  For one  thing, it\n\nis by no means clear that Banks' memorandum in support of his\n\nRule  59(e) motion,  which  devoted  only  three-and-one-half\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\npages to  a summary of the  claimant's substantive arguments,\n\nconstituted  a full  presentation of  those arguments  to the\n\ndistrict court.   The  claimant in  Flores, by  contrast, had\r                                                      \n\nsubmitted  \"a 22-page memorandum arguing that the Secretary's\n\ndecision was  not supported by substantial  evidence,\" id. at\r                                                                     \n\n402,  which the court of appeals  deemed \"fully presented his\n\nsubstantive  arguments,\"  id. at  403.    Also,  we  are  not\r                                        \n\nsatisfied that the district court, in denying  the Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion, signalled that it had given adequate consideration to\n\nBanks'  arguments.   Whereas  the  district  court in  Flores\r                                                                         \n\nspecifically  stated that  it had  reviewed \"the  motion, the\n\nrecord,  and the law,\"   id., the district  court here simply\r                                       \n\nendorsed the motion with \"Motion denied.\"   \n\n          Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district\r                                            \n\ncourt  and remand  this  case for  further  proceedings.   On\r                             \n\nremand, the  district court  is to  establish a briefing,  or\n\noral  argument,   schedule  that  affords   the  parties   an\n\nopportunity to  present  their  arguments  before  the  court\n\nissues its ruling. \n\n                             -7-\r\r\n",

Plaintiff-appellant  John  Banks has\r                                 \n\nappealed  from  the  district  court's  order  affirming  the\n\nSecretary's  denial of  Social Security  disability benefits.\n\nBecause the  district  court  issued  its  affirmance  before\n\naffording Banks  an opportunity to submit argument explaining\n\nhis objections  to the  Secretary's determination,  we remand\n\nthis case to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n          Banks  applied for  disability benefits  on January\n\n15,  1991, alleging an  inability to work due  to a number of\n\nphysical  and  mental ailments.    On October  12,  1993, the\n\nAppeals  Council  denied Banks'  request  for  review of  the\n\nfinding of  an Administrative  Law Judge  that Banks  was not\n\ndisabled.  \n\n          On  December 17,  1993, Banks  brought the  instant\n\naction  in  the District  of  Massachusetts  seeking judicial\n\nreview  of the Secretary's decision.   The Secretary filed an\n\nanswer  to  Banks'  complaint,  accompanied  by  the 767-page\n\nadministrative  record of the case,  on March 22,  1994.  One\n\nweek  later, on March 29, 1994, the district court sua sponte\n\n--  without notice  to the  parties,  and without  giving the\n\nparties  an  opportunity  to  submit  argument  --  issued  a\n\nmemorandum and order affirming the decision of the Secretary.\n\nJudgment for the Secretary was issued on that same date.\n\n          On April 11, 1994, Banks filed a motion to alter or\n\namend the  judgment under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  59(e).   In that\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmotion Banks argued  that it  was improper  for the  district\n\ncourt to enter judgment against Banks without affording Banks\n\nan  opportunity to  brief  the issues  in  the case.    Banks\n\nincluded a  proposed briefing  schedule.   On  April 14,  the\n\ndistrict  court   summarily  denied  Banks'  motion.    Banks\n\nappeals, pressing this same point.\n\n          This court has never considered the question of the\n\npropriety of  a  district court,  on review  of a  disability\n\ndetermination, affirming the  Secretary without affording the\n\nclaimant  an opportunity  to  present argument.1   The  three\n\ncircuits  that have  addressed the  issue, however,  have all\n\ndeclined to sanction the practice.  \n\n          In  Kistner v.
