This is an  appeal from the  district\r                                \n\ncourt's judgment  denying the  motion of appellant  Thomas E.\n\nBehenna to withdraw his guilty  plea.  Behenna pleaded guilty\n\nto a  three-count information charging him  with making false\n\nstatements to Dime Savings Bank of New York (\"Dime New York\")\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C.   1014.\n\n                         I.BACKGROUND\r                                                 \n\n          In  1987,  Charles McCormick,  a client  of Behenna\n\n(who is an attorney), told Behenna about a chance to purchase\n\ncondominium  units at two condominium developments, Hawthorne\n\nVillage  in North  Attleboro and  Queens Court  in Plainview,\n\nMassachusetts.   Behenna was informed that  these units could\n\nbe  purchased  with  almost  no  money  down.    Further, the\n\ndeveloper of Hawthorne Village, David Burns, told Behenna and\n\nother  purchasers that  Burns  would give  them a  10 percent\n\nsecond mortgage and a 10 percent \"discount.\"\n\n          Arrangements  were made  to have  Dime New  York, a\n\nfederally insured  bank, provide  the  financing through  its\n\n\"Impact\"  loan program.   Under  this program,  purchasers of\n\nresidential  real  estate making  cash  down  payments of  20\n\npercent of the purchase price received loan approval prior to\n\nthe  receipt  of  documents  verifying  financial  and  other\n\ninformation contained  in their loan applications.   Dime New\n\nYork's wholly owned subsidiary,  Dime Real Estate Services of\n\nMassachusetts  (\"Dime  Mass.\"),  processed  the  Impact  loan\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\napplications  in  Massachusetts;  Eric  Peach was  the  sales\n\nrepresentative who handled the loans in question.\n\n          Behenna   and   the   other   purchasers   of   the\n\ncondominiums were  informed that instead of  cash, they could\n\nuse  the  10  percent  discount and  the  10  percent  second\n\nmortgage as  the down  payment.  Nonetheless,  Behenna's loan\n\napplications stated that cash down payments had been made and\n\nhis purchase and sale (\"P  &amp; S\") agreements also  erroneously\n\nreflected  the presence  of  20 percent  cash down  payments.\n\nAccording  to Behenna, Peach was  aware of the  true terms of\n\nthe financing  and  told him  (Behenna)  that Dime  New  York\n\napproved of  this type  of financing.   In  addition, Behenna\n\nprepared  addenda to the P &amp; S agreements which revealed that\n\nthe second  mortgages and the  discounts were the  sources of\n\nthe  down payments.    Behenna gave  the agreements  with the\n\naddenda to Peach.\n\n          After  the  loan  applications  were  approved, the\n\nclosings took place at the office of Dime's closing attorney,\n\nAlan  Segal.    At  this  time,  Behenna  signed  Fannie  Mae\n\naffidavits and HUD-1 settlement statements indicating that he\n\nhad made 20  percent cash  down payments.1   The HUD-1  forms\n\nstated that  there was  no secondary financing  in connection\n\nwith  the purchases  and, in  the same  vein, the  Fannie Mae\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  These forms required a loan applicant to attest  that the\nstatements  contained in the forms were true and accurate and\nwarned that making false statements was a crime.\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\naffidavits failed  to disclose  the second mortgages  and the\n\ndiscounts.   Finally, Behenna  was aware, at  this time, that\n\nthe addenda were no longer attached to the P &amp; S agreements.\n\n          Eventually,  the  Federal  Bureau of  Investigation\n\nconducted an investigation into  Dime New York's  allegations\n\nof  fraud  in connection  with these  loans.   At  this time,\n\nBehenna met with government personnel.  According to Behenna,\n\nhe was  told that  Dime New  York had  never authorized a  no\n\nmoney  down loan program, that  it was unaware  of the second\n\nmortgages and that it  did not have in its  files the addenda\n\nto Behenna's P &amp; S agreements.  After Behenna learned that he\n\nwas about to be indicted on charges of bank fraud, conspiracy\n\nand making  false statements to a federally  insured bank, he\n\ndecided  to plead guilty.  In return for his cooperation with\n\nthe government, the government agreed to limit the charges to\n\nthe making of false statements.  During these discussions and\n\nin  the subsequent  district  court proceedings,  Behenna was\n\nrepresented by counsel.\n\n          At his change of  plea hearing, Behenna stated that\n\nhe knew when he signed the Fannie Mae affidavits and the HUD-\n\n1   settlement   statements   that   they   contained   false\n\ninformation.   Pursuant  to the plea  agreement and  prior to\n\nsentencing,  Behenna   testified   as  a   witness  for   the\n\nprosecution in  the trial of Segal,  Dime's closing attorney,\n\nand Robert  Kline,  an  attorney for  the  developer  of  the\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ncondominiums  at Hawthorne Village.  At the end of trial, the\n\ncourt  granted  Segal's  and  Kline's  motions  for  directed\n\nverdicts.      One and a half months later, Behenna filed the\n\nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\n          Behenna's   main  argument   was  that   his  false\n\nstatements were  not material  because the  Segal-Kline trial\n\nevidence  showed that  the  bank management  connived in  the\n\nscheme.  The district court invited briefs on the standard of\n\nmateriality under  the  statute.   Ultimately,  the  district\n\ncourt  said  that  materiality  should  be  evaluated  on  an\n\nobjective basis and  the court denied the motion  to withdraw\n\nthe plea.  This appeal followed.\n\n                          II.THE LAW\r                                                \n\n          A.  Fed. R. Crim.

Specifically,  he claims  that  the\n\nevidence  at  the trial  of Segal  and  Kline and  reports of\n\nstatements  given to  the FBI  by various  employees of  Dime\n\nMass. establish  that the bank,  in fact, had  authorized the\n\n\"no money down\" payment  loan program.  He also  asserts that\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nthis evidence shows that  he had made full disclosure  to the\n\nbank  of  the  true  terms  of  his  financing  arrangements.\n\nBehenna  argues that  he should  be allowed  to withdraw  his\n\nguilty  plea because  the government misrepresented  the true\n\nfacts to him prior to his decision to plead guilty.\n\n          In a case strikingly similar to this one, the Court\n\nof  Appeals  for the  Fifth  Circuit  rejected a  defendant's\n\nargument that his false statements did not  have the capacity\n\nto  influence  the  lending  institution  because the  entire\r                                                                         \n\ninstitution was  aware of defendant's scheme.   United States\r                                                                         \n\nv. Johnson,  585 F.2d 119, 124  (5th Cir. 1978).   The court,\r                      \n\nassuming the  truth of  defendant's assertion concerning  the\n\nextent  of the  lending  institution's  knowledge, held  that\n\n\"[t]he  focus of  the offense  is on  the defendant's  intent\n\nrather than on the victim.\"  Id.  The court went on:\r                                            \n\n               The phrase \"for the  purpose of\n               influencing in any way\" defines\r                                                 \n               the    intent    required    to\n               accompany a false statement and\n               defines it broadly.   It  draws\n               under  its  purview not  only a\n               defendant   who   intends    to\n               defraud  an  unwitting  insured\n               institution    but    also    a\n               defendant   who   intends    to\n               cooperate with  the institution\n               in a scheme requiring him, with\n               the institution's knowledge, to\n               make  false statements  for the\n               furtherance of the scheme.  The\n               savings and loan's awareness of\n               the fraud is not  relevant, for\n               its     existence    is     not\n               inconsistent with the intent to\n               influence which a violator of  \n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n               1014 must possess.   Thus, this\n               collection  of   facts  labeled\n               \"complicity\"  is not  a defense\n               to  a  charged violation  of 18\n               U.S.C.   1014.\n\nId.

Simply, the  assertion that\n\nDime New  York acquiesced in  the use of  secondary financing\n\nand had full knowledge that borrowers often did not make cash\n\ndown payments in connection with the Impact loan program does\n\nnot  provide  a  defense  to   the  charge  of  making  false\n\nstatements under   1014.

In Wilcox, defendant submitted to a savings and loan\r                              \n\nassociation phony vouchers stating that work on a real estate\n\ndevelopment   had  been  completed.     These  vouchers  were\n\nnecessary to  obtain the  loan proceeds.   Defendant asserted\n\nthat   the  false   vouchers  were  submitted   according  to\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\ninstructions  from  the lender,  that  the  officials of  the\n\nassociation never indicated that their advice  concerning the\n\nvouchers  would lead  to  illegal conduct,  that  he had  not\n\nintended to mislead the association and that although he knew\n\nthat  the   information  in  the  vouchers   was  false,  the\n\nassociation was aware of the true circumstances. \n\n          The court held: \n\n               Here,  the  submission  of  the\n               false vouchers  was designed to\n               influence  the disbursement  of\n               funds by the savings  and loan.\n               The filing of the documents was\n               a prerequisite to the financial\n               institution's  payments of  the\n               defendant's  claims.   In fact,\n               under the procedures adopted by\n               [the association], the payments\n               could not have been made unless\n               the  defendant  made the  false\n               representations at issue.  That\n               defendant    may    have   been\n               encouraged  in this  scheme, or\n               even  joined in  it, by  one or\n               more bank officials affords him\n               no defense at all.\n\nId.\r               \n\n          As in Wilcox, the evidence shows that Dime New York\r                                  \n\nwould not  have made an  Impact loan in  the absence of  a 20\n\npercent deposit made up  of the borrower's own funds.   Thus,\n\nBehenna's  false statements concerning the down payments were\n\nnecessary  prerequisites  to  obtaining the  proceeds  of the\n\nloans and the statements were made  precisely for the purpose\n\nof  influencing  Dime  New   York  in  making  its  decisions\n\nregarding the loans.\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n          Finally,  one  of the  most significant  factors in\n\ndeciding whether a  defendant has  met his or  her burden  of\n\nestablishing  a  \"fair and  just  reason\"  for withdrawing  a\n\nguilty  plea is  whether the plea  is knowing  and voluntary.\n\nAllard, 926  F.2d at 1243; Kobrosky, 711 F.2d at 455.  In the\r                                               \n\nchange of plea hearing, the district court judge explained to\n\nBehenna what rights he  was giving up by pleading  guilty and\n\nwhat  the maximum  penalties were;  he next  ascertained that\n\nBehenna had discussed these  matters with his attorney.   The\n\ngovernment laid out the  evidence it would present  at trial.\n\nAsked  why he was pleading guilty, Behenna responded that the\n\nHUD-1  statements  and  the Fannie  Mae  affidavits contained\n\nfalse statements and that he knew this when he signed them.\n\n          Nothing in the record of the change of plea hearing\n\nindicates   that   Behenna  \"was   anything  other   than  an\n\nintelligent defendant who fully  understood what he was doing\n\nand was competent voluntarily to enter [a] guilty plea.\"  See\r                                                                         \n\nKobrosky, 711 F.2d at  455; Ramos, 810 F.2d at  314 (district\r                                             \n\ncourt's compliance with Fed.

Behenna to withdraw his guilty plea.  Behenna pleaded guilty to a three-count information charging him with making false statements to Dime Savings Bank of New York (\"Dime New York\") in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Charles McCormick, a client of Behenna (who is an attorney), told Behenna about a chance to purchase condominium units at two condominium developments, Hawthorne Village in North Attleboro and Queens Court in Plainview, Massachusetts.  Behenna was informed that these units could be purchased with almost no money down.  Further, the developer of Hawthorne Village, David Burns, told Behenna and other purchasers that Burns would give them a 10 percent second mortgage and a 10 percent \"discount.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrangements were made to have Dime New York, a federally insured bank, provide the financing through its \"Impact\" loan program.  Under this program, purchasers of residential real estate making cash down payments of 20 percent of the purchase price received loan approval prior to the receipt of documents verifying financial and other information contained in their loan applications.  Dime New York's wholly owned subsidiary, Dime Real Estate Services of Massachusetts (\"Dime Mass.\"), processed the Impact loan applications in Massachusetts;  Eric Peach was the sales representative who handled the loans in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Behenna and the other purchasers of the condominiums were informed that instead of cash, they could use the 10 percent discount and the 10 percent second mortgage as the down payment.  Nonetheless, Behenna's loan applications stated that cash down payments had been made and his purchase and sale (\"P &amp; S\") agreements also erroneously reflected the presence of 20 percent cash down payments.  According to Behenna, Peach was aware of the true terms of the financing and told him (Behenna) that Dime New York approved of this type of financing.  In addition, Behenna prepared addenda to the P &amp; S agreements which revealed that the second mortgages and the discounts were the sources of the down payments.  Behenna gave the agreements with the addenda to Peach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the loan applications were approved, the closings took place at the office of Dime's closing attorney, Alan Segal.  At this time, Behenna signed Fannie Mae affidavits and HUD-1 settlement statements indicating that he had made 20 percent cash down payments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The HUD-1 forms stated that there was no secondary financing in connection with the purchases and, in the same vein, the Fannie Mae affidavits failed to disclose the second mortgages and the discounts.  Finally, Behenna was aware, at this time, that the addenda were no longer attached to the P &amp; S agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an investigation into Dime New York's allegations of fraud in connection with these loans.  At this time, Behenna met with government personnel.  According to Behenna, he was told that Dime New York had never authorized a no money down loan program, that it was unaware of the second mortgages and that it did not have in its files the addenda to Behenna's P &amp; S agreements.  After Behenna learned that he was about to be indicted on charges of bank fraud, conspiracy and making false statements to a federally insured bank, he decided to plead guilty.  In return for his cooperation with the government, the government agreed to limit the charges to the making of false statements.  During these discussions and in the subsequent district court proceedings, Behenna was represented by counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his change of plea hearing, Behenna stated that he knew when he signed the Fannie Mae affidavits and the HUD-1 settlement statements that they contained false information.  Pursuant to the plea agreement and prior to sentencing, Behenna testified as a witness for the prosecution in the trial of Segal, Dime's closing attorney, and Robert Kline, an attorney for the developer of the condominiums at Hawthorne Village.  At the end of trial, the court granted Segal's and Kline's motions for directed verdicts.  One and a half months later, Behenna filed the motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Behenna's main argument was that his false statements were not material because the Segal-Kline trial evidence showed that the bank management connived in the scheme.  The district court invited briefs on the standard of materiality under the statute.  Ultimately, the district court said that materiality should be evaluated on an objective basis and the court denied the motion to withdraw the plea.

That is, the government is not required to show that the lending institution actually relied on the defendant's statements in making its decision to approve a loan.  Id. See Haddock, 956 F.2d at 1550 (actual reliance need not be shown to meet materiality requirement);  United States v.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Behenna's primary argument is that he is innocent of violating Sec. 1014.  Specifically, he claims that the evidence at the trial of Segal and Kline and reports of statements given to the FBI by various employees of Dime Mass. establish that the bank, in fact, had authorized the \"no money down\" payment loan program.  He also asserts that this evidence shows that he had made full disclosure to the bank of the true terms of his financing arrangements.  Behenna argues that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because the government misrepresented the true facts to him prior to his decision to plead guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case strikingly similar to this one, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected a defendant's argument that his false statements did not have the capacity to influence the lending institution because the entire institution was aware of defendant's scheme.  United States v. Johnson, 585 F.2d 119, 124 (5th Cir. 1978).  The court, assuming the truth of defendant's assertion concerning the extent of the lending institution's knowledge, held that \"[t]he focus of the offense is on the defendant's intent rather than on the victim.\"  Id. The court went on:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>The phrase \"for the purpose of influencing in any way \" defines the intent required to accompany a false statement and defines it broadly.  It draws under its purview not only a defendant who intends to defraud an unwitting insured institution but also a defendant who intends to cooperate with the institution in a scheme requiring him, with the institution's knowledge, to make false statements for the furtherance of the scheme.  The savings and loan's awareness of the fraud is not relevant, for its existence is not inconsistent with the intent to influence which a violator of Sec. 1014 must possess.  Thus, this collection of facts labeled \"complicity\" is not a defense to a charged violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. See also United States v. Bush, 599 F.2d 72, 75 (5th Cir. 1979) (\"[T]he words 'for the purpose of influencing' define the quality of the required intent, they do not immunize a party in duplicity with a bank officer.\");  United States v. Kennedy, 564 F.2d 1329, 1340 (9th Cir. 1977) (defendant was not immunized from criminal liability \"merely because the bank officer was a party to the scheme\"), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 944 (1978);  United States v. Niro, 338 F.2d 439, 440 (2d Cir. 1964) (the court described as a \"non sequitur \" the argument that defendant's false statements could not have influenced the lender because the president of the lending institution had suggested the scheme).  Cf. Concemi, 957 F.2d at 944-45 (one of the defendants was a loan originator for the bank);  Norberg, 612 F.2d at 2 (defendant was the attorney for and a director of the bank);  United States v. Sheehy, 541 F.2d 123, 124 (1st Cir. 1976) (defendant was a member of the bank's executive committee which was responsible for approving loans).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding whether to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea, a court ordinarily will \"not decide the merits of a proffered defense by resolving factual issues that are more properly decided at trial.\"  United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1242 (1st Cir. 1991).  \"However, when the defendant's factual allegations, even if true, fail to establish a cognizable defense, they do not provide a reason for permitting withdrawal of a plea.\"  Id. See also Ramos, 810 F.2d at 312 (Rule 32 motion may be denied if a defendant's factual contentions do not create a recognized defense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the caselaw, it is plain that Behenna's claim of innocence must fail.  Simply, the assertion that Dime New York acquiesced in the use of secondary financing and had full knowledge that borrowers often did not make cash down payments in connection with the Impact loan program does not provide a defense to the charge of making false statements under Sec. 1014.  See Johnson, 585 F.2d at 124.  The relevant determination for criminal liability is not dependent on whether the lender relied, or even participated in, the fraud;  rather, the offense is based on the defendant's \"intent to influence an action, and nothing more.\"  Wilcox, 919 F.2d at 112.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, it is clear, notwithstanding Behenna's claim to the contrary, that he possessed the requisite intent.  In Wilcox, defendant submitted to a savings and loan association phony vouchers stating that work on a real estate development had been completed.  These vouchers were necessary to obtain the loan proceeds.  Defendant asserted that the false vouchers were submitted according to instructions from the lender, that the officials of the association never indicated that their advice concerning the vouchers would lead to illegal conduct, that he had not intended to mislead the association and that although he knew that the information in the vouchers was false, the association was aware of the true circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court held:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>Here, the submission of the false vouchers was designed to influence the disbursement of funds by the savings and loan.  The filing of the documents was a prerequisite to the financial institution's payments of the defendant's claims.  In fact, under the procedures adopted by [the association], the payments could not have been made unless the defendant made the false representations at issue.  That defendant may have been encouraged in this scheme, or even joined in it, by one or more bank officials affords him no defense at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in Wilcox, the evidence shows that Dime New York would not have made an Impact loan in the absence of a 20 percent deposit made up of the borrower's own funds.  Thus, Behenna's false statements concerning the down payments were necessary prerequisites to obtaining the proceeds of the loans and the statements were made precisely for the purpose of influencing Dime New York in making its decisions regarding the loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, one of the most significant factors in deciding whether a defendant has met his or her burden of establishing a \"fair and just reason\" for withdrawing a guilty plea is whether the plea is knowing and voluntary.  Allard, 926 F.2d at 1243;  Kobrosky, 711 F.2d at 455.  In the change of plea hearing, the district court judge explained to Behenna what rights he was giving up by pleading guilty and what the maximum penalties were;  he next ascertained that Behenna had discussed these matters with his attorney.  The government laid out the evidence it would present at trial.  Asked why he was pleading guilty, Behenna responded that the HUD-1 statements and the Fannie Mae affidavits contained false statements and that he knew this when he signed them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record of the change of plea hearing indicates that Behenna \"was anything other than an intelligent defendant who fully understood what he was doing and was competent voluntarily to enter [a] guilty plea.\"  See Kobrosky, 711 F.2d at 455;  Ramos, 810 F.2d at 314 (district court's compliance with Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11 \"weighs heavily\" against a defendant).  In this situation, \"[w]e will not permit a defendant to turn his back on his own representations to the court merely because it would suit his convenience to do so.\"  United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1539 (1st Cir. 1989).  The plea having been given knowingly and voluntarily, we cannot say that the district court judge abused his discretion by denying Behenna's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our conclusions, we reject Behenna's claim that there was no factual basis for his guilty plea.  See United States v. Webb, 433 F.2d 400, 403 (1st Cir. 1970) (where court questioned defendant about the elements of the crime and had the prosecution present the evidence it had gathered, there existed a factual basis for the plea), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 958 (1971).  We also find no merit in Behenna's assertion that the government withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).  Plainly, the information in the FBI reports was not exculpatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These forms required a loan applicant to attest that the statements contained in the forms were true and accurate and warned that making false statements was a crime</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We reject, out of hand, Behenna's argument that his statements were not made to a federally insured bank.  In United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 80, 81 (1994), we held, in the context of bank fraud, that the government \"does not have to show the alleged scheme was directed solely toward a particular institution;  it is sufficient to show that defendant knowingly executed a fraudulent scheme that exposed a federally insured bank to a risk of loss.\"  Here, there is no dispute that the loans in question were assigned to Dime New York</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Behenna to withdraw his guilty plea.  Behenna pleaded guilty to a three-count information charging him with making false statements to Dime Savings Bank of New York (\"Dime New York\") in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Charles McCormick, a client of Behenna (who is an attorney), told Behenna about a chance to purchase condominium units at two condominium developments, Hawthorne Village in North Attleboro and Queens Court in Plainview, Massachusetts.  Behenna was informed that these units could be purchased with almost no money down.  Further, the developer of Hawthorne Village, David Burns, told Behenna and other purchasers that Burns would give them a 10 percent second mortgage and a 10 percent \"discount.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arrangements were made to have Dime New York, a federally insured bank, provide the financing through its \"Impact\" loan program.  Under this program, purchasers of residential real estate making cash down payments of 20 percent of the purchase price received loan approval prior to the receipt of documents verifying financial and other information contained in their loan applications.  Dime New York's wholly owned subsidiary, Dime Real Estate Services of Massachusetts (\"Dime Mass.\"), processed the Impact loan applications in Massachusetts;  Eric Peach was the sales representative who handled the loans in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Behenna and the other purchasers of the condominiums were informed that instead of cash, they could use the 10 percent discount and the 10 percent second mortgage as the down payment.  Nonetheless, Behenna's loan applications stated that cash down payments had been made and his purchase and sale (\"P &amp; S\") agreements also erroneously reflected the presence of 20 percent cash down payments.  According to Behenna, Peach was aware of the true terms of the financing and told him (Behenna) that Dime New York approved of this type of financing.  In addition, Behenna prepared addenda to the P &amp; S agreements which revealed that the second mortgages and the discounts were the sources of the down payments.  Behenna gave the agreements with the addenda to Peach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the loan applications were approved, the closings took place at the office of Dime's closing attorney, Alan Segal.  At this time, Behenna signed Fannie Mae affidavits and HUD-1 settlement statements indicating that he had made 20 percent cash down payments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The HUD-1 forms stated that there was no secondary financing in connection with the purchases and, in the same vein, the Fannie Mae affidavits failed to disclose the second mortgages and the discounts.  Finally, Behenna was aware, at this time, that the addenda were no longer attached to the P &amp; S agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an investigation into Dime New York's allegations of fraud in connection with these loans.  At this time, Behenna met with government personnel.  According to Behenna, he was told that Dime New York had never authorized a no money down loan program, that it was unaware of the second mortgages and that it did not have in its files the addenda to Behenna's P &amp; S agreements.  After Behenna learned that he was about to be indicted on charges of bank fraud, conspiracy and making false statements to a federally insured bank, he decided to plead guilty.  In return for his cooperation with the government, the government agreed to limit the charges to the making of false statements.  During these discussions and in the subsequent district court proceedings, Behenna was represented by counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his change of plea hearing, Behenna stated that he knew when he signed the Fannie Mae affidavits and the HUD-1 settlement statements that they contained false information.  Pursuant to the plea agreement and prior to sentencing, Behenna testified as a witness for the prosecution in the trial of Segal, Dime's closing attorney, and Robert Kline, an attorney for the developer of the condominiums at Hawthorne Village.  At the end of trial, the court granted Segal's and Kline's motions for directed verdicts.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Behenna's primary argument is that he is innocent of violating Sec. 1014.  Specifically, he claims that the evidence at the trial of Segal and Kline and reports of statements given to the FBI by various employees of Dime Mass. establish that the bank, in fact, had authorized the \"no money down\" payment loan program.  He also asserts that this evidence shows that he had made full disclosure to the bank of the true terms of his financing arrangements.  Behenna argues that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because the government misrepresented the true facts to him prior to his decision to plead guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case strikingly similar to this one, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected a defendant's argument that his false statements did not have the capacity to influence the lending institution because the entire institution was aware of defendant's scheme.  United States v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360204\"><a href=\"/opinion/360204/united-states-v-charles-glenn-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 124 (5th Cir. 1978).  The court, assuming the truth of defendant's assertion concerning the extent of the lending institution's knowledge, held that \"[t]he focus of the offense is on the defendant's intent rather than on the victim.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360204\"><a href=\"/opinion/360204/united-states-v-charles-glenn-johnson/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> The court </a></span>went on:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>The phrase \"for the purpose of influencing in any way \" defines the intent required to accompany a false statement and defines it broadly.  It draws under its purview not only a defendant who intends to defraud an unwitting insured institution but also a defendant who intends to cooperate with the institution in a scheme requiring him, with the institution's knowledge, to make false statements for the furtherance of the scheme.  The savings and loan's awareness of the fraud is not relevant, for its existence is not inconsistent with the intent to influence which a violator of Sec. 1014 must possess.  Thus, this collection of facts labeled \"complicity\" is not a defense to a charged violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360204\"><a href=\"/opinion/360204/united-states-v-charles-glenn-johnson/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> See also </a></span>United States v.

Simply, the assertion that Dime New York acquiesced in the use of secondary financing and had full knowledge that borrowers often did not make cash down payments in connection with the Impact loan program does not provide a defense to the charge of making false statements under Sec. 1014.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360204\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Johnson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/360204/united-states-v-charles-glenn-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>.  The relevant determination for criminal liability is not dependent on whether the lender relied, or even participated in, the fraud;  rather, the offense is based on the defendant's \"intent to influence an action, and nothing more.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551582\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wilcox,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/551582/united-states-v-richard-d-wilcox/\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, it is clear, notwithstanding Behenna's claim to the contrary, that he possessed the requisite intent.  In Wilcox, defendant submitted to a savings and loan association phony vouchers stating that work on a real estate development had been completed.  These vouchers were necessary to obtain the loan proceeds.  Defendant asserted that the false vouchers were submitted according to instructions from the lender, that the officials of the association never indicated that their advice concerning the vouchers would lead to illegal conduct, that he had not intended to mislead the association and that although he knew that the information in the vouchers was false, the association was aware of the true circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court held:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>Here, the submission of the false vouchers was designed to influence the disbursement of funds by the savings and loan.  The filing of the documents was a prerequisite to the financial institution's payments of the defendant's claims.  In fact, under the procedures adopted by [the association], the payments could not have been made unless the defendant made the false representations at issue.  That defendant may have been encouraged in this scheme, or even joined in it, by one or more bank officials affords him no defense at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in Wilcox, the evidence shows that Dime New York would not have made an Impact loan in the absence of a 20 percent deposit made up of the borrower's own funds.  Thus, Behenna's false statements concerning the down payments were necessary prerequisites to obtaining the proceeds of the loans and the statements were made precisely for the purpose of influencing Dime New York in making its decisions regarding the loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, one of the most significant factors in deciding whether a defendant has met his or her burden of establishing a \"fair and just reason\" for withdrawing a guilty plea is whether the plea is knowing and voluntary.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556604\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Allard,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/556604/united-states-v-raymond-p-allard/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421132\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kobrosky,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/421132/united-states-v-milton-l-kobrosky/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>.  In the change of plea hearing, the district court judge explained to Behenna what rights he was giving up by pleading guilty and what the maximum penalties were;  he next ascertained that Behenna had discussed these matters with his attorney.  The government laid out the evidence it would present at trial.  Asked why he was pleading guilty, Behenna responded that the HUD-1 statements and the Fannie Mae affidavits contained false statements and that he knew this when he signed them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record of the change of plea hearing indicates that Behenna \"was anything other than an intelligent defendant who fully understood what he was doing and was competent voluntarily to enter [a] guilty plea.\"  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421132\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kobrosky,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/421132/united-states-v-milton-l-kobrosky/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482471\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ramos,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/482471/united-states-v-hector-acevedo-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">314</span> </a></span>(district court's compliance with Fed.
