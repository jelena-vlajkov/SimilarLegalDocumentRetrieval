Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Cyr, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nWilliam J.

We have reviewed  the parties' briefs  and\r                           \r\n\nthe  record on appeal.  We affirm essentially for the reasons\r\n\nstated in the district court's order, dated March 28, 1995.\r\n\n     We add  only the following comment.   Appellant contends\r\n\nthat res judicata ought not to apply because, in this federal\r\n\nproceeding, he  is seeking equitable relief,  which the state\r\n\ndistrict  court  did not  have  jurisdiction to  award.   The\r\n\nargument  is unavailing.   Because a  state court  of general\r\n\njurisdiction -  the state superior  court - was  available to\r\n\nappellant, appellant  is precluded from  splitting his claim,\r\n\neven though he brought his action first in a court of limited\r\n\njurisdiction.  See e.g.,  Restatement (Second) of Judgments  \r                                   \r\n\n24 cmt. g (1982).
