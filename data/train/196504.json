Appellant   Prudential\r                    TORRUELLA,   Chief   Judge.\r                                              \r\n\nSecurities  Incorporated,  formerly Prudential-Bache  Securities,\r\n\nInc. (\"Prudential\"), seeks the reversal of a judgment, entered in\r\n\ntwo consolidated actions,  confirming arbitration awards  entered\r\n\nby a  panel of New  York Stock  Exchange arbitrators in  favor of\r\n\nJos   F.  Rodr guez   (\"Rodr guez\"),  Robert  Tanner  (\"Tanner\"),\r\n\nGarland Hedges  (\"Hedges\"), Wolfram  Pietri (\"Pietri\"), and  Jos \r\n\nCimadevilla  (\"Cimadevilla\"),  former  employees of  Prudential's\r\n\nsubsidiary  in  Puerto  Rico,  Prudential-Bache  Capital  Funding\r\n\nPuerto  Rico, Inc.  (\"PBPR\").  Prudential  argues that  the award\r\n\nshould be vacated  on either  of two  grounds:   first, that  the\r\n\narbitration award  was in manifest  disregard of Puerto  Rico Law\r\n\n80;  and  second,   that  it  went  against  a  well-defined  and\r\n\nestablished   public  policy  requiring   that  securities  firms\r\n\nmaintain  accurate and  current books  and records.   However, we\r\n\nfind that Prudential neither meets the  standard for the vacation\r\n\nof an  award on the  grounds of  manifest disregard,  set out  in\r\n\nAdvest,  Inc.  v.  McCarthy, 914  F.2d  6  (1st  Cir. 1990),  nor\r                                     \r\n\ndemonstrates  that the  arbitration  panel found  that  appellees\r\n\nacted  against  public  policy.   Since  its  argument  that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  erred  in  refusing  to  vacate  the  awards  of\r\n\nattorney's fees and costs  also fails, we affirm the  judgment of\r\n\nthe court below on all points.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  arbitration  underlying  this  case  arose out  of\r\n\nPrudential's decision  to close  its Puerto Rican  subsidiary and\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nterminate the employment of  several executives assigned to PBPR.\r\n\nOn  December  29,  1990,  Rodr guez, former  President  of  PBPR,\r\n\ntogether with his wife and their conjugal partnership, filed suit\r\n\nagainst   Prudential,  seeking  compensation  for  his  allegedly\r\n\nwrongful  discharge.    Appellant  Prudential  moved  to   compel\r\n\narbitration, and the lower court stayed all discovery and ordered\r\n\nthe  parties  to  proceed  with  the arbitration  of  all  claims\r\n\npertaining  to Rodr guez.    The claims  of  his wife  and  their\r\n\nconjugal  partnership  were   stayed  pending  the  arbitration's\r\n\noutcome.   Meanwhile,  the claims of  Tanner, Hedges,  Pietri and\r\n\nCimadevilla,  all  also  former  PBPR  executives,  were  brought\r\n\ndirectly through arbitration.\r\n\n          An arbitration  panel appointed  by the New  York Stock\r\n\nExchange  heard the  parties'  claims between  February 1992  and\r\n\nDecember 1993.  On  January 7, 1994, the panel  issued its award,\r\n\nunder which  Prudential was  to pay Tanner  $1,028,000, Rodr guez\r\n\n$1,014,250, Hedges  $312,750,  Pietri $310,750,  and  Cimadevilla\r\n\n$216,025.  Various amounts in costs and attorney's fees were also\r\n\nawarded.   When Rodr guez moved  the district court  for entry of\r\n\njudgment  on the award, Prudential filed a petition to vacate the\r\n\narbitration award  as against all  claimants on the  grounds that\r\n\n(1) the award  was against public  policy; (2)  the award was  in\r\n\nconflict with Puerto  Rico Law  80; (3) the  award of  attorney's\r\n\nfees was contrary to  law; (4) the arbitrators improperly  denied\r\n\nPrudential   the  opportunity  to   conduct  discovery  into  the\r\n\nclaimants' financial position and current earnings; (5) the award\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nfailed to properly  record the decision  of the arbitrators  that\r\n\nPrudential  was not  responsible for  promissory notes  issued by\r\n\nTanner  and Rodr guez to their employees at Prudential in lieu of\r\n\ncash bonuses;  and  (6)  the award  incorrectly  noted  that  the\r\n\narbitrators ordered that appropriate shares of the  bonus were to\r\n\nbe paid to claimants.  They\r\n\ncontest the district court's findings on the first three of these\r\n\nissues on appeal.\r\n\n                          DISCUSSION    \r                                    DISCUSSION\r\n\n                      A.

Appellees argue that Prudential's petition\r\n\nis governed by  Rule 627(g) of  the Rules of  the New York  Stock\r\n\nExchange  (\"NYSE\"),  which  they  maintain establishes  a  30-day\r\n\nperiod for filing petitions  to vacate.2  Since the  petition was\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  The Rule states:\r\n\n            All  monetary awards shall be paid within\r\n            thirty  (30)  days  of receipt  unless  a\r\n            motion  to vacate has  been filed  with a\r\n            court  of  competent  jurisdiction.    An\r\n            award shall  bear interest from  the date\r\n            of  the award:   (i)  if not  paid within\r\n            thirty  (30) days of receipt, (ii) if the\r\n            award  is  the  subject  of a  motion  to\r\n            vacate  which  is  denied,  or  (iii)  as\r\n            specified  by  the  arbitrator(s) in  the\r\n            award.  Interest shall be assessed at the\r\n            legal  rate, if  any, then  prevailing in\r\n            the state where  the award was  rendered,\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nfiled  on March 9,  1994,  sixty-one  days  after the  award  was\r\n\nissued,  under appellees'  reading of  Rule 627(g),  Prudential's\r\n\npetition  would be time-barred.  In  turn, Prudential claims that\r\n\nits petition is governed by the 90-day period  set out in   12 of\r\n\nthe FAA,  9 U.S.C.    12 (1994),3 and  so is  timely.  The  court\r\n\nbelow found that Section 12 of the FAA applies,  and the petition\r\n\nis not time-barred.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Appellees make  their argument  in two stages.   First,\r\n\nthey maintain  that, since parties  may agree to  arbitrate under\r\n\nnon-FAA rules,4  and the  parties submitted a  Uniform Submission\r\n\nAgreement to  the NYSE  providing that  the arbitration  would be\r\n\nconducted in  accordance with the  rules of the  exchange,5 those\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            or at a rate set by the arbitrator(s).\r\n\n2 New York Stock Exchange Guide, Rule 627(g) (1989).\r\n\n3  The Rule states, in pertinent part:\r\n\n            Notice of a  motion to vacate,  modify or\r\n            correct an award must be  served upon the\r\n            adverse  party  or  his  attorney  within\r\n            three months after the award is  filed or\r\n            delivered.\r\n\n9 U.S.C.   12 (1994).\r\n\n4   See Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton,     U.S.    ,    ,\r                                                       \r\n115 S. Ct.  1212, 1216, 131 L.Ed.2d  76 (1995) (noting  that \"the\r\nFAA's pro-arbitration  policy does not operate  without regard to\r\nthe  wishes of  the contracting  parties\"); Volt  Info.

Board of Trustees, 489 U.S. 468, 479 (1989) (\"Arbitration\r                                   \r\nunder the Act  is a matter of consent,  not coercion, and parties\r\nare generally  free to structure their  arbitration agreements as\r\nthey see fit\").\r\n\n5  Each appellee  signed an Employment Agreement  with Prudential\r\nthat  contained an arbitration clause.   The clause provided for,\r\ninter alia,  settlement of all claims  arising between Prudential\r                    \r\nand  its  employees  through  arbitration  under  the  prevailing\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nrules  trump the FAA.   Second, they  argue that Rule  626(g), by\r\n\nrequiring payment of the award within 30 days of its receipt if a\r\n\nmotion  to vacate has not been filed, compels the conclusion that\r\n\nany  challenge to an arbitration  award must be  filed within the\r\n\nsame period. \r\n\n          We are not convinced, however.  We do not question that\r\n\nthe  NYSE Rules  apply.  Where  parties agree  to a  set of rules\r\n\ndifferent than those of the FAA, \"enforcing those rules according\r\n\nto the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with  the goals\r\n\nof  the FAA,  even if  the result  is that arbitration  is stayed\r\n\nwhere the Act  would otherwise permit it  to go forward.\"   Volt,\r                                                                          \r\n\n489 U.S. at  479.  While we agree  with appellees' first premise,\r\n\nhowever, we do not subscribe to their second one.\r\n\n          Appellees seek to find a time limit in Rule 627(g) that\r\n\nit does  not include.   To  support  their reading  of the  rule,\r\n\nappellees  argue  that it  is  meant  to  operate  as a  stay  of\r\n\nexecution for the period during which the party may challenge the\r\n\naward.  In that context,  they maintain it would be  senseless to\r\n\nallow such  a stay  for only  30 days  if  the period  to file  a\r\n\npetition to  vacate is to be governed by the 90-day period of the\r\n\nFAA, as the award would be  subject to enforcement during the  60\r\n\ndays following the  expiration of  the stay.   While their  logic\r\n\nholds some merit, they  cannot escape the  fact that the text  of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nConstitution  and  Rules  of  the NYSE.    Also,  the  Submission\r\nAgreement which the parties  filed with the NYSE shows  that they\r\nsubmitted their  dispute to  arbitration in accordance  with that\r\nbody's Rules, Constitution, By-laws, Regulations, and/or Code  of\r\nArbitration.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthe Rule  is clear.  As  stated by the court  below, \"[t]he plain\r\n\nlanguage of Rule 627(g) . . . does  not even address the question\r\n\nof  a  time  limitation  on  motions  for  vacatur,   but  rather\r\n\nestablishes  when awards are to be paid and the precise moment at\r\n\nwhich interest begins to  accrue on unpaid amounts of  an award.\"\r\n\nRodr guez v.

We are unwilling  to read a time  limit into its\r\n\nlanguage. \r\n\n          In  contrast, the  text of  Section 12  is unambiguous,\r\n\nclearly setting out a 90-day time limit.  Since the  Rules of the\r\n\nNYSE provide no time limit, we find that the FAA 90-day provision\r\n\napplies,  and appellant's  petition  is timely.

McCarthy,  arbitration awards are  subject to\r                                      \r\n\nreview \"where it  is clear  from the record  that the  arbitrator\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nrecognized the  applicable law--and then ignored it.\"6   914 F.2d\r\n\nat 9.\r\n\n          Prudential argues that this is such a case.  It asserts\r\n\nthat  appellees   were   terminated  for   \"just   cause\"   under\r\n\nCommonwealth Law  80,  which sets  out the  remedy for  employees\r\n\nunder   contracts  without  fixed  duration  who  are  wrongfully\r\n\ndischarged.   29  L.P.R.A.   185a  (Supp. 1991).

Since Prudential does not state its basis\r\n\nfor  overturning the award, we  presume it is  relying on Section\r\n\n10(a)(4) of the  FAA, which  provides that courts  may set  aside\r\n\nawards when  the  arbitrators  exceed  their powers.    9  U.S.C.\r\n\n  10(a)(4).

First,  we do not think that  the district court read\r\n\nan implicit basis for awarding  attorney's fees into Rule 629(c).\r\n\nThe  rule states that it provides for \"costs and expenses, unless\r\n\napplicable  law directs  otherwise.\"   We read  this  language to\r\n\ninclude  attorney's fees, and  have found no  case law suggesting\r\n\notherwise.14\r\n\n          Second,  although not  noted  by the  court below,  the\r\n\nrecord reveals  that both parties requested  attorney's fees from\r\n\nthe  panel (Joint  Appendix,  pp. 811,  923-24), suggesting  that\r\n\nawarding  fees was contemplated by  the parties to  be within the\r\n\nscope of the agreement to arbitrate.

Thus, given that the panel had evidence in front\r\n\nof it as  to obstinate  or frivolous conduct,  that both  parties\r\n\nrequested attorney's  fees, and that  the NYSE Rules  provide for\r\n\nthe award  of  fees,  we cannot  conclude  that  the  arbitrators\r\n\nexceeded the scope of their authority under Section 10(a)(4).\r\n\n          Finally,  Prudential argues  that the  former employees\r\n\nfailed to leap  a procedural hurdle, since they did  not submit a\r\n\nverified statement to the panel itemizing all expenses sought, as\r\n\nmandated by  Puerto Rico  civil  procedure.     P.R. R.  Civ.  P.\r\n\n44.1(a),  (b).  In so  arguing, Prudential ignores  the fact that\r\n\nthe parties agreed to arbitrate under the rules of the  NYSE, and\r\n\nRule 629(c)  imposes no  itemization requirement.   Nevertheless,\r\n\nthe appellees itemized  their costs in their closing brief, filed\r\n\nfive  days before the parties  made their final  arguments to the\r\n\npanel.   While  Prudential had  the opportunity to  challenge the\r\n\naccuracy or reasonableness of the  costs, it chose not to do  so.\r\n\nTherefore,  because we  do not  find  that the  arbitration panel\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nclearly exceeded the scope of its powers, and giving its decision\r\n\nthe  deference  due to  arbitrators, we  find  that the  award of\r\n\nattorney's fees should not be vacated.

However, we\r\n\nfind that Prudential neither meets the  standard for the vacation\r\n\nof an  award on the  grounds of  manifest disregard,  set out  in\r\n\nAdvest,  Inc.  v.

Since  its  argument  that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  erred  in  refusing  to  vacate  the  awards  of\r\n\nattorney's fees and costs  also fails, we affirm the  judgment of\r\n\nthe court below on all points.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  arbitration  underlying  this  case  arose out  of\r\n\nPrudential's decision  to close  its Puerto Rican  subsidiary and\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nterminate the employment of  several executives assigned to PBPR.\r\n\nOn  December  29,  1990,  Rodr guez, former  President  of  PBPR,\r\n\ntogether with his wife and their conjugal partnership, filed suit\r\n\nagainst   Prudential,  seeking  compensation  for  his  allegedly\r\n\nwrongful  discharge.    Appellant  Prudential  moved  to   compel\r\n\narbitration, and the lower court stayed all discovery and ordered\r\n\nthe  parties  to  proceed  with  the arbitration  of  all  claims\r\n\npertaining  to Rodr guez.    The claims  of  his wife  and  their\r\n\nconjugal  partnership  were   stayed  pending  the  arbitration's\r\n\noutcome.   Meanwhile,  the claims of  Tanner, Hedges,  Pietri and\r\n\nCimadevilla,  all  also  former  PBPR  executives,  were  brought\r\n\ndirectly through arbitration.\r\n\n          An arbitration  panel appointed  by the New  York Stock\r\n\nExchange  heard the  parties'  claims between  February 1992  and\r\n\nDecember 1993.  On  January 7, 1994, the panel  issued its award,\r\n\nunder which  Prudential was  to pay Tanner  $1,028,000, Rodr guez\r\n\n$1,014,250, Hedges  $312,750,  Pietri $310,750,  and  Cimadevilla\r\n\n$216,025.  Various amounts in costs and attorney's fees were also\r\n\nawarded.   When Rodr guez moved  the district court  for entry of\r\n\njudgment  on the award, Prudential filed a petition to vacate the\r\n\narbitration award  as against all  claimants on the  grounds that\r\n\n(1) the award  was against public  policy; (2)  the award was  in\r\n\nconflict with Puerto  Rico Law  80; (3) the  award of  attorney's\r\n\nfees was contrary to  law; (4) the arbitrators improperly  denied\r\n\nPrudential   the  opportunity  to   conduct  discovery  into  the\r\n\nclaimants' financial position and current earnings; (5) the award\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nfailed to properly  record the decision  of the arbitrators  that\r\n\nPrudential  was not  responsible for  promissory notes  issued by\r\n\nTanner  and Rodr guez to their employees at Prudential in lieu of\r\n\ncash bonuses;  and  (6)  the award  incorrectly  noted  that  the\r\n\narbitrators ordered that appropriate shares of the  bonus were to\r\n\nbe paid to claimants.

Appellees argue that Prudential's petition\r\n\nis governed by  Rule 627(g) of  the Rules of  the New York  Stock\r\n\nExchange  (\"NYSE\"),  which  they  maintain establishes  a  30-day\r\n\nperiod for filing petitions  to vacate.2  Since the  petition was\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  The Rule states:\r\n\n            All  monetary awards shall be paid within\r\n            thirty  (30)  days  of receipt  unless  a\r\n            motion  to vacate has  been filed  with a\r\n            court  of  competent  jurisdiction.    An\r\n            award shall  bear interest from  the date\r\n            of  the award:   (i)  if not  paid within\r\n            thirty  (30) days of receipt, (ii) if the\r\n            award  is  the  subject  of a  motion  to\r\n            vacate  which  is  denied,  or  (iii)  as\r\n            specified  by  the  arbitrator(s) in  the\r\n            award.  Interest shall be assessed at the\r\n            legal  rate, if  any, then  prevailing in\r\n            the state where  the award was  rendered,\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nfiled  on March 9,  1994,  sixty-one  days  after the  award  was\r\n\nissued,  under appellees'  reading of  Rule 627(g),  Prudential's\r\n\npetition  would be time-barred.  In  turn, Prudential claims that\r\n\nits petition is governed by the 90-day period  set out in   12 of\r\n\nthe FAA,  9 U.S.C.    12 (1994),3 and  so is  timely.  The  court\r\n\nbelow found that Section 12 of the FAA applies,  and the petition\r\n\nis not time-barred.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Appellees make  their argument  in two stages.   First,\r\n\nthey maintain  that, since parties  may agree to  arbitrate under\r\n\nnon-FAA rules,4  and the  parties submitted a  Uniform Submission\r\n\nAgreement to  the NYSE  providing that  the arbitration  would be\r\n\nconducted in  accordance with the  rules of the  exchange,5 those\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            or at a rate set by the arbitrator(s).\r\n\n2 New York Stock Exchange Guide, Rule 627(g) (1989).\r\n\n3  The Rule states, in pertinent part:\r\n\n            Notice of a  motion to vacate,  modify or\r\n            correct an award must be  served upon the\r\n            adverse  party  or  his  attorney  within\r\n            three months after the award is  filed or\r\n            delivered.\r\n\n9 U.S.C.   12 (1994).\r\n\n4   See Mastrobuono v.

While we agree  with appellees' first premise,\r\n\nhowever, we do not subscribe to their second one.\r\n\n          Appellees seek to find a time limit in Rule 627(g) that\r\n\nit does  not include.   To  support  their reading  of the  rule,\r\n\nappellees  argue  that it  is  meant  to  operate  as a  stay  of\r\n\nexecution for the period during which the party may challenge the\r\n\naward.  In that context,  they maintain it would be  senseless to\r\n\nallow such  a stay  for only  30 days  if  the period  to file  a\r\n\npetition to  vacate is to be governed by the 90-day period of the\r\n\nFAA, as the award would be  subject to enforcement during the  60\r\n\ndays following the  expiration of  the stay.   While their  logic\r\n\nholds some merit, they  cannot escape the  fact that the text  of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nConstitution  and  Rules  of  the NYSE.    Also,  the  Submission\r\nAgreement which the parties  filed with the NYSE shows  that they\r\nsubmitted their  dispute to  arbitration in accordance  with that\r\nbody's Rules, Constitution, By-laws, Regulations, and/or Code  of\r\nArbitration.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthe Rule  is clear.  As  stated by the court  below, \"[t]he plain\r\n\nlanguage of Rule 627(g) . . . does  not even address the question\r\n\nof  a  time  limitation  on  motions  for  vacatur,   but  rather\r\n\nestablishes  when awards are to be paid and the precise moment at\r\n\nwhich interest begins to  accrue on unpaid amounts of  an award.\"\r\n\nRodr guez v.

Thus, given that the panel had evidence in front\r\n\nof it as  to obstinate  or frivolous conduct,  that both  parties\r\n\nrequested attorney's  fees, and that  the NYSE Rules  provide for\r\n\nthe award  of  fees,  we cannot  conclude  that  the  arbitrators\r\n\nexceeded the scope of their authority under Section 10(a)(4).\r\n\n          Finally,  Prudential argues  that the  former employees\r\n\nfailed to leap  a procedural hurdle, since they did  not submit a\r\n\nverified statement to the panel itemizing all expenses sought, as\r\n\nmandated by  Puerto Rico  civil  procedure.     P.R. R.  Civ.  P.\r\n\n44.1(a),  (b).  In so  arguing, Prudential ignores  the fact that\r\n\nthe parties agreed to arbitrate under the rules of the  NYSE, and\r\n\nRule 629(c)  imposes no  itemization requirement.   Nevertheless,\r\n\nthe appellees itemized  their costs in their closing brief, filed\r\n\nfive  days before the parties  made their final  arguments to the\r\n\npanel.   While  Prudential had  the opportunity to  challenge the\r\n\naccuracy or reasonableness of the  costs, it chose not to do  so.\r\n\nTherefore,  because we  do not  find  that the  arbitration panel\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nclearly exceeded the scope of its powers, and giving its decision\r\n\nthe  deference  due to  arbitrators, we  find  that the  award of\r\n\nattorney's fees should not be vacated.
