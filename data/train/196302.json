In June 1994,  appellant Richard Ferguson,\r                           \r\n\nfiled a document in  the district court (hereinafter Document\r\n\n#508) which  the court  properly treated  as a  motion, filed\r\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255, to vacate, set aside or correct\r\n\nhis sentence.  In Document #508, Ferguson complained that (1)\r\n\nthere was  disparity among  the sentences imposed  on himself\r\n\nand his  co-defendants, (2)  there were  miscalculations [not\r\n\nfurther specified] by the probation office in calculating his\r\n\n\"volnerability  [sic]  under  the sentencing  guidelines,  an\r\n\nerror  his  newly appointed  counsel failed  to point  out or\r\n\nobject  to at  sentencing,\" (3)  he had  received ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel [not further described] from indictment\r\n\nto sentencing  and (4)  contrary  to a  prior district  court\r\n\nconclusion,  he  had  given  substantial  assistance  to  the\r\n\ngovernment since  his sentencing.  The  district court denied\r\n\nthe   2255 motion and Ferguson has appealed.\r\n\n     Ferguson'  initial  brief  on  appeal  essentially  is a\r\n\ncompilation of documents that  Ferguson filed in the district\r\n\ncourt after that  court's ruling  on Document #508.   To  the\r                       \r\n\nextent  that he argues  matters not raised  in Document #508,\r\n\nthose arguments are not properly before us for review.\r\n\n     We  turn to the issues that are raised by Document #508.\r\n\nOn appeal, Ferguson makes no  argument regarding his claim of\r\n\nmiscalculation  by the  probation  office in  calculating his\r\r\n\n\"volnerability\"    under    the    sentencing    guidelines.1\r\n\nSimilarly, Ferguson  makes  no appellate  argument about  his\r\n\ncomplaint that the district court erred in concluding that he\r\n\nhad not given substantial  assistance to the government since\r\n\nhis sentencing.   These  claims are  therefore waived.2   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nLareau v. Page, 39 F.3d 384, 390  n.3 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting\r                          \r\n\nthat claims raised below but not addressed in appellate brief\r\n\nare deemed abandoned).\r\n\n     Ferguson complains that co-defendants who, like himself,\r\n\ntestified against the remainder who went to trial, received\r\n\nlesser  sentences than he received.  \"[I]n the ordinary case,\r\n\n'[t]he  guidelines do  not  require the  sentencing court  to\r\n\nconsider related cases or  to justify a sentence in  terms of\r\n\nthe punishment  meted out to co-defendants.'\"   United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Munoz, 36 F.3d  1229, 1239 (1st Cir. 1994),  cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n115 S.  Ct.  1164  (1995) (quoting  United  States  v.  Font-\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We interpret this claim to relate to Ferguson's assertion\r\nof mental and emotional problems.\r\n\n2.  In  any  event,  Ferguson's  claim that  his  counsel  at\r\nsentencing  failed  to  point  out his  mental  or  emotional\r\nproblems or object to the probation office's characterization\r\nof his mental and emotional health claims is directly refuted\r\nby the written objections filed  by Ferguson's counsel to the\r\npresentence report  and by  the transcript of  the sentencing\r\nhearing.\r\n     And, the district court's authority to reduce a sentence\r\ndue  to   substantial  assistance  in  the  investigation  or\r\nprosecution of another person is initiated upon motion by the\r                                                                         \r\ngovernment,  see, e.g., 18 U.S.C.   3553(e); Fed. R. Crim. P.\r                                  \r\n35(b),   -  an initiating  event that did  not occur  in this\r\ncase.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nRamirez, 944 F.2d 42,  50 (1st Cir. 1991), cert.  denied, 502\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  1065 (1992)).   Moreover, Ferguson has  only pointed to\r\n\nthe apparent disparity without suggesting that the testifying\r\n\nco-defendants  were similarly situated as to criminal history\r\n\nand culpability and ignores the fact that mandatory sentences\r\n\nforfirearms violationsplayeda rolein determininghis sentence.\r\n\n     Finally, although  Ferguson's briefs argue the  issue of\r\n\nineffective assistance of counsel - a claim that Ferguson did\r\n\nraise in Document #508 -  he has fleshed out this claim  with\r\n\nallegations,  for example,  an  alleged conflict  of interest\r\n\npossessed by counsel Grossberg, that Ferguson did not present\r\n\nto the district court in Document #508.  Thus,  we decline to\r\n\nconsider this  particular claim.3   See, e.g.,  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Pierce, 60 F.3d 886, 890-91 (1st Cir. 1995) (declining to\r                      \r\n\naddress,  in  the  first  instance,  a  claim  that  was  not\r\n\npresented to the district court).\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  We note, however, that  Ferguson's claim that (a) counsel\r\nknowingly  misled him  into believing  that his  sentence for\r\nfirearms violations  would run concurrent  with, rather  than\r\nconsecutive  to, his sentence on the other charges and (b) if\r\nhe had known  that a consecutive  sentence was mandatory,  he\r\nwould not have pled  guilty, but would have gone to trial, is\r\nbelied  by  the  transcript  of  the  guilty  plea  in  which\r\nFerguson, himself,  recites that  the penalties for  Count 16\r                             \r\nand Count 20 each are five years in addition to  the sentence\r\nimposed on the underlying crimes.

Pierce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196196\"><a href=\"/opinion/196196/united-states-v-pierce/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 890-91 (1st Cir.1995) (declining to address, in the first instance, a claim that was not presented to the district court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We interpret this claim to relate to Ferguson's assertion of mental and emotional problems</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In any event, Ferguson's claim that his counsel at sentencing failed to point out his mental or emotional problems or object to the probation office's characterization of his mental and emotional health claims is directly refuted by the written objections filed by Ferguson's counsel to the presentence report and by the transcript of the sentencing hearing</p>\n        <p>And, the district court's authority to reduce a sentence due to substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person is initiated upon motion by the government, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(e);  Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b),--an initiating event that did not occur in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note, however, that Ferguson's claim that (a) counsel knowingly misled him into believing that his sentence for firearms violations would run concurrent with, rather than consecutive to, his sentence on the other charges and (b) if he had known that a consecutive sentence was mandatory, he would not have pled guilty, but would have gone to trial, is belied by the transcript of the guilty plea in which Ferguson, himself, recites that the penalties for Count 16 and Count 20 each are five years in addition to the sentence imposed on the underlying crimes.
