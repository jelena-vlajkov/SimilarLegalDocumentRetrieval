Jeffrey  A.  Diminico  appeals  the\r                                 \r\n\ndistrict  court's denial of his 28 U.S.C.   2255 motion.  The\r\n\nsole  argument made in this motion is that the district court\r\n\nimproperly  delegated to  the United States  Probation Office\r\n\nthe  task of  setting  a payment  schedule for  restitution.1\r                                                                        1\r\n\nDiminico did not raise  this issue at sentencing, and  he did\r\n\nnot pursue a direct appeal.   A   2255 motion cannot serve as\r\n\na substitute for  appeal.   See United States  v. Frady,  456\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 152, 165  (1982).  Having failed  to raise his claim  of\r\n\nunauthorized  delegation  of  judicial  authority  on  direct\r\n\nappeal, Diminico cannot raise  it on collateral attack absent\r\n\na showing of cause for the failure and actual prejudice.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nColeman v.

Since\r                          \r\n\nDiminico  has  not  even  attempted to  meet  the  cause-and-\r\n\nprejudice requirement,  we affirm  the denial  of his    2255\r\n\nmotion.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1On appeal,  Diminico raises additional challenges  to the\r               1\r\ndistrict court's restitution order.   Since these issues were\r\nnot presented in his   2255 motion, we deem them waived.  See\r                                                                         \r\nSingleton  v.
