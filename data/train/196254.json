This  appeal  requires us  to\r                    SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\r                                          \r\n\naddress,  for   the  first  time,  a   \"safe  harbor\"  regulation\r\n\npromulgated  by the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) as a means\r\n\nof exempting certain group insurance programs from the strictures\r\n\nof the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974  (ERISA),\r\n\n29 U.S.C.    1001-1461.  Determining, as we do, that the district\r\n\ncourt  appropriately applied  the regulation,  and  discerning no\r\n\nclear  error in the court's  factual findings on  other issues in\r\n\nthe case, we affirm the judgment below.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Plaintiff-appellee  James Johnson worked  as a forklift\r\n\noperator  at the  Webster  Valve division  of defendant-appellant\r\n\nWatts Regulator Co. (Watts) in Franklin, New Hampshire.  While so\r\n\nemployed, plaintiff  elected to participate in  a group insurance\r\n\nprogram made available to Watts' employees by defendant-appellant\r\n\nCIGNA Employee  Benefit Company  d/b/a Life Insurance  Company of\r\n\nNorth  America (CIGNA).    Under the  program plaintiff  received\r\n\ninsurance protection against accidental death, dismemberment, and\r\n\npermanent disability.   He  paid  the premium  through a  payroll\r\n\ndeduction plan.  Watts, in turn, remitted the premium payments to\r\n\nCIGNA.   \r\n\n          On  June 15, 1990, while  a participant in the program,\r\n\nplaintiff  sustained  a  severe   head  injury  in  a  motorcycle\r\n\naccident.  He remained disabled for the ensuing year, and, having\r\n\ncrossed the policy's temporal  threshold, he applied for benefits\r\n\non  July 17,  1991.   CIGNA  turned  him down,  claiming  that he\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nretained the residual capacity  to do some work.   Plaintiff then\r\n\nsued Watts and CIGNA in a New Hampshire state court.  Postulating\r\n\nthe  existence  of   an  ERISA-related   federal  question,   the\r\n\ndefendants removed the action to the district court.\r\n\n          Following  an evidentiary  hearing, the  district court\r\n\nruled that ERISA did not pertain.  See Johnson v. Watts Regulator\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.,  No.  92-508-JD,  1994  WL  258788  (D.N.H.  May  3,  1994).\r             \r\n\nNevertheless,  the court  denied  plaintiff's  motion to  remand,\r\n\nnoting diverse citizenship and the  existence of a controversy in\r\n\nthe  requisite amount.   See  28 U.S.C.    1332(a).   The parties\r                                      \r\n\nsubsequently tried the  case to the bench.   The judge heard  the\r\n\nevidence, perused  the group  policy, applied New  Hampshire law,\r\n\nfound  plaintiff  to be  totally  and  permanently disabled,  and\r\n\nawarded the  maximum benefit,  together with attorneys'  fees and\r\n\ncosts.  See Johnson  v. Watts Regulator Co., No.  92-508-JD, 1994\r                                                     \r\n\nWL 587801 (D.N.H. Oct. 26, 1994).  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  THE ERISA ISSUE\r          II.  THE ERISA ISSUE\r\n\n          The  curtain-raiser  question  in  this  case  involves\r\n\nwhether  the  program  under  which Johnson  sought  benefits  is\r\n\nsubject to Title  I of  ERISA.  Confronting  this issue  requires\r\n\nthat  we   interpret  and  apply  the   Secretary's  safe  harbor\r\n\nregulation,  29 C.F.R.   2510.3-1(j) (1994).  We divide this part\r\n\nof our analysis into  four segments.   First, we explain why  the\r\n\ncurtain-raiser question matters.   Second, we limn the applicable\r\n\nstandard  of review.  Third, we discuss the regulation itself and\r\n\nhow it fits into the statutory and regulatory scheme.  Fourth, we\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nscrutinize the  record and  test the district  court's conclusion\r\n\nthat the program is within the safe harbor.\r\n\n                    A.  The ERISA Difference.\r                              A.  The ERISA Difference.\r                                                      \r\n\n          From   the  earliest  stages   of  the   litigation,  a\r\n\ncontroversy  has raged  over  the relationship,  if any,  between\r\n\nERISA  and the  group  insurance program  underwritten by  CIGNA.\r\n\nThis controversy  stems from  perceived self-interest:   if ERISA\r\n\napplies, preemption is  triggered, see 29 U.S.C.    1144(a), and,\r                                                \r\n\nin many situations, the substitution of ERISA principles (whether\r\n\nderived from the statute  itself or from federal common  law) for\r\n\nstate-law  principles  can make  a  pronounced  difference.   For\r\n\nexample, ERISA preemption may cause potential state-law  remedies\r\n\nto vanish, see,  e.g., Carlo  v. Reed Rolled  Thread Die Co.,  49\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 790, 794 (1st Cir.  1995);  McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst.  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nTechnology,  950 F.2d 13, 18  (1st Cir. 1991),  cert. denied, 504\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 910 (1992), or may change the standard of review, see, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nFirestone  Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.  Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1988),\r                                                \r\n\nor may affect the  admissibility of evidence, see, e.g.,  Taft v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nEquitable Life Ins. Co., 9 F.3d 1469, 1471-72 (9th Cir. 1993), or\r                                 \r\n\nmay determine whether a jury trial is available, see, e.g., Blake\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Unionmutual Stock  Life Ins.

But exploring that\r\n\nquestion does not strike us  as a prudent use of scarce  judicial\r\n\nresources.   Given the  marshalled realities    the parties agree\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthat the ERISA difference is of potential significance here; they\r\n\nsuccessfully persuaded the district court to that view; and it is\r\n\nentirely plausible under the circumstances of this case  that the\r\n\napplicability vel non of ERISA makes a meaningful difference   we\r                               \r\n\nrefrain from  speculation about  the parties' tactical  goals and\r\n\nproceed directly  to a determination  of whether the  court below\r\n\ncorrectly concluded that state law provides the rule of decision.\r\n\n                     B.  Standard of Review.\r                               B.  Standard of Review.\r                                                     \r\n\n          The question  of whether ERISA applies  to a particular\r\n\nplan or program requires an evaluation of the facts combined with\r\n\nan elucidation of the law.  See, e.g., Kulinski v. Medtronic Bio-\r                                                                           \r\n\nMedicus,  Inc., 21 F.3d 254, 256 (8th Cir. 1994) (explaining that\r                        \r\n\nthe existence  of an ERISA plan  is a mixed question  of fact and\r\n\nlaw);  Peckham v. Gem  State Mut., 964 F.2d  1043, 1047 n.5 (10th\r                                           \r\n\nCir. 1992)  (similar).  For  purposes of appellate  review, mixed\r\n\nquestions  of  fact and  law ordinarily  fall along  a degree-of-\r\n\ndeference  continuum,  ranging  from  plenary   review  for  law-\r\n\ndominated  questions  to  clear-error review  for  fact-dominated\r\n\nquestions.  See In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1327-\r                                                     \r\n\n28   (1st  Cir.   1993).     Plenary   review   is,  of   course,\r\n\nnondeferential, whereas clear-error  review is quite deferential.\r\n\nSee id.  Both standards are in play here.\r                 \r\n\n          The interpretation  of a  regulation presents  a purely\r\n\nlegal question, sparking de  novo review.  See, e.g.,  Strickland\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Commissioner, Me. Dep't  of Human Serv., 48  F.3d 12, 16 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1994); Liberty Mut.  Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union  Ins. Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n978  F.2d 750,  757 (1st  Cir. 1992).   Once  the meaning  of the\r\n\nregulation has been clarified, however, the \"mixed\" question that\r\n\nremains    the regulation's applicability  in a given  case   may\r\n\nrequire factfinding, and if it does, that factfinding is reviewed\r\n\nonly for  clear error.  To that extent, the existence of an ERISA\r\n\nplan  becomes primarily  a  question of  fact.   See  Wickman  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nNorthwestern  Nat'l  Ins.

ERISA safeguards  these interests in a variety  of ways,\r\n\ne.g.,   by  creating   comprehensive  reporting   and  disclosure\r\n\nrequirements, see 29 U.S.C.    1021-1031, by setting standards of\r                           \r\n\nconduct   for  fiduciaries,   see  id.       1101-1114,   and  by\r                                                \r\n\nestablishing an appropriate remedial  framework, see id.    1131-\r                                                                  \r\n\n1145.  An  integral part  of the  statutory scheme  is a  broadly\r\n\nworded  preemption clause  that, in  respect to  covered employee\r\n\nbenefit plans,  sets to  one side  \"all  laws, decisions,  rules,\r\n\nregulations, or other State  action having the effect of  law, of\r\n\nany State.\"  Id.   1144(a).

The parties agree  that the  group\r\n\ninsurance program that CIGNA wrote for Watts' employees, covering\r\n\naccidental  death,  dismemberment,   and  permanent   disability,\r\n\nqualifies  as a  \"program\" of  employee welfare benefits  as that\r\n\nterm is used in the statute.

The regulation provides  in relevant\r                   \r\n\npart that the term \r\n\n          \"employee  welfare  benefit  plan\" shall  not\r\n          include  a  group  or   group-type  insurance\r\n          program offered by an insurer to employees or\r\n          members  of  an employee  organization, under\r\n          which:\r\n\n          (1) No contributions are made by  an employer\r\n          or employee organization;\r\n\n          (2)   Participation   [in]  the   program  is\r\n          completely   voluntary   for   employees   or\r\n          members;\r\n\n          (3) The  sole  functions of  the employer  or\r\n          employee  organization  with  respect to  the\r\n          program are, without  endorsing the  program,\r\n          to   permit  the  insurer  to  publicize  the\r\n          program to  employees or members,  to collect\r\n          premiums through payroll  deductions or  dues\r\n          checkoffs and to remit  them to the  insurer;\r\n          and\r\n\n          (4)  The  employer  or employee  organization\r\n          receives no consideration in the form of cash\r\n          or otherwise in connection with  the program,\r\n          other than reasonable compensation, excluding\r\n          any   profit,  for   administrative  services\r\n          actually rendered in connection  with payroll\r\n          deductions or dues checkoffs.\r\n\n29  C.F.R.     2510.3-1(j).     A  program  that  satisfies   the\r\n\nregulation's  standards   will  be   deemed  not  to   have  been\r\n\n\"established  or  maintained\" by  the  employer.   The  converse,\r\n\nhowever, is not necessarily true; a program that fails to satisfy\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nthe regulation's  standards is  not automatically deemed  to have\r\n\nbeen \"established or maintained\" by the employer, but, rather, is\r\n\nsubject to further evaluation under the conventional tests.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHansenv. Continental Ins.

In theory, an employer can assist its work\r\n\nforce by  arranging for  the provision  of desirable  coverage at\r\n\nattractive rates,  but, by complying with  the regulation, assure\r\n\nitself that, if  it acts  only as  an honest  broker and  remains\r\n\nneutral vis-a-vis the plan's operation, it will not be put to the\r\n\ntrouble  and expense  that meeting ERISA's  requirements entails.\r\n\nFailure  to fulfill any  one of the  four criteria  listed in the\r\n\nregulation, however, closes the  safe harbor and exposes a  group\r\n\ninsurance program, if it otherwise qualifies as an ERISA program,\r\n\nto the strictures of the Act.

We concentrate,  therefore, on  the regulation's\r\n\nthird facet.  This is a fitting focus, as the Department of Labor\r\n\nhas called  the employer neutrality  that the third  facet evokes\r\n\n\"the  key to the rationale for not  treating such a program as an\r\n\nemployee benefit plan . . . .\"  40 Fed.

But as  the\r             \r\n\nregulation  itself indicates, remaining  neutral does not require\r\n\nan  employer to  build a  moat  around a  program or  to separate\r\n\nitself from all aspects of program administration.  Thus, as long\r\n\nas the employer merely advises  employees of the availability  of\r\n\ngroup insurance,  accepts payroll  deductions, passes them  on to\r\n\nthe insurer, and performs other ministerial tasks that assist the\r\n\ninsurer in publicizing the program, it will not be deemed to have\r\n\nendorsed the  program under  section 2510.3-1(j)(3).   See Kanne,\r                                                                          \r\n\n867 F.2d  at 492; du  Mortier, 805 F. Supp.  at 821.

Cumberland Farms Dairy,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 972 F.2d  453, 457 (1st Cir.  1992); Cumpiano, 902  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n152-153.  Applying this deferential  standard, we cannot say that\r\n\nthe trial court's \"no endorsement\" finding is clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          The   anatomy   of   the   court's   determination   is\r\n\ninstructive.  Based primarily on  the testimony of two  corporate\r\n\nofficials    Watts'  benefits administrator  and Webster  Valve's\r\n\nemployee relations manager   the court found that the company had\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  question of endorsement vel non is a mixed question of\r                                                    \r\nfact  and law.  In some cases  the evidence will point unerringly\r\nin one direction so that a  rational factfinder can reach but one\r\nconclusion.  In those cases, endorsement becomes a matter of law.\r\nCf.  Griffin v.  United  States,  502  U.S.  46,  55  n.1  (1991)\r                                         \r\n(discussing  \"adequacy  on  the proof  as  made\"  as meaning  not\r\nwhether the evidence  sufficed to  enable an alleged  fact to  be\r\nfound, but, rather,  whether the facts adduced at  trial sufficed\r\nin  law to support a  verdict); Anderson v.  Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n477 U.S. 242,  251-52 (1986) (describing the  appropriate mode of\r\ninquiry for directed verdicts and  summary judgments).  In  other\r\ncases, the legal significance  of the facts is less  certain, and\r\nthe  outcome will  depend on  the inferences that  the factfinder\r\nchooses to draw.  See, e.g.,  TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n426 U.S.  438, 450 (1976); In  re Varasso, 37 F.3d  760, 763 (1st\r                                                   \r\nCir.  1994).  In those  cases, endorsement becomes  a question of\r\nfact.  This case is of the latter type.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nmade its  employees aware of the opportunity  to obtain coverage,\r\n\nbut  had stopped short of  endorsing the program.   CIGNA drafted\r\n\nthe  policy and,  presumably,  set the  premium rates.   Although\r\n\nWatts  distributed the sales brochure, waiver-of-insurance cards,\r\n\nand enrollment cards, those efforts were undertaken to help CIGNA\r\n\npublicize the program; the documents themselves were prepared and\r\n\nprinted  by CIGNA, and delivered by it to Watts for distribution.\r\n\nWatts recommended enrollment via a cover letter (reproduced as an\r\n\nappendix hereto)  written on  the letterhead of  Watts Industries\r\n\nand signed by  its vice-president for  financial matters.   CIGNA\r\n\ntypeset the letter and incorporated it into the cover page of the\r\n\nbrochure.   The letter explicitly informed  Watts' employees that\r\n\nthe enrollment  decision  was  theirs to  make.    Watts  nowhere\r\n\nsuggested that it had any  control over, or proprietary  interest\r\n\nin,  the group  insurance  program.   And,  finally, neither  the\r\n\nletter nor any other passage in the brochure mentioned ERISA.\r\n\n          The  district   court   also  examined   Watts'   other\r\n\nactivities concerning  the  program.   Watts  collected  premiums\r\n\nthrough  payroll  deductions,  remitted  the  premiums  to CIGNA,\r\n\nissued   certificates  to   enrolled  employees   confirming  the\r\n\ncommencement of  coverage, maintained  a list of  insured persons\r\n\nfor  its own records, and  assisted CIGNA in securing appropriate\r\n\ndocumentation when claims eventuated.   Watts' activities in this\r\n\nrespect consisted principally of filling out the employer portion\r\n\nof  the claim form,  inserting statistical information maintained\r\n\nin Watts' personnel  files (such as the insured's  name, address,\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nage,  classification, and  date  of hire),  making various  forms\r\n\navailable to  employees (e.g.,  claim forms),4 and  keeping track\r\n\nof  employee eligibility.   Watts would follow  up on  a claim to\r\n\ndetermine  its status, if CIGNA  requested that Watts  do so, and\r\n\nwould occasionally answer a broker's questions about a claim.  In\r\n\nsum, Watts  performed only  administrative  tasks, eschewing  any\r\n\nrole in the substantive aspects of  program design and operation.\r\n\nIt had no  hand in drafting the plan, working  out its structural\r\n\ncomponents,  determining  eligibility for  coverage, interpreting\r\n\npolicy  language, investigating, allowing and disallowing claims,\r\n\nhandling litigation, or negotiating settlements.\r\n\n          In  the last  analysis, the  district court  found that\r\n\nWatts' cover  letter fell  short of constituting  an endorsement.\r\n\nThe  court pointed out that  neither the letter  nor the brochure\r\n\nexpressly stated that the  employer endorsed the program.   Apart\r\n\nfrom the letter,  the court  concluded that  Watts had  performed\r\n\nonly ministerial activities,  and that these activities  (whether\r\n\nviewed alone or  in conjunction  with the cover  letter) did  not\r\n\nrise to the level of an endorsement.\r\n\n          We believe that  this finding deserves  our allegiance.\r\n\nDrawing permissible inferences from the evidence, the trial court\r\n\ncould  plausibly  conclude  on   this  scumbled  record  that  an\r\n\nobjectively reasonable employee would not have thought that Watts\r\n\nendorsed  the  group insurance  program.   Several considerations\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4CIGNA prepared  and  printed all  such  forms, and  sent  a\r\nsupply of forms to Watts.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nlead us in this direction.  We offer a representative sampling.\r\n\n          First, we think that  endorsement of a program requires\r\n\nmore  than  merely  recommending  it.    An  employer's  publicly\r\n\nexpressed opinion as to  the quality, utility and/or value  of an\r\n\ninsurance  plan, without  more,  while relevant  to (and  perhaps\r\n\nprobative of) endorsement, will  most often not indicate employer\r\n\ncontrol of the plan.   Second, the administrative  functions that\r\n\nWatts   undertook   fit   comfortably   within   the  Secretary's\r\n\nregulation.  Activities such  as issuing certificates of coverage\r\n\nand  maintaining a list of  enrollees are plainly  ancillary to a\r\n\npermitted function (implementing payroll deductions).  Activities\r\n\nsuch  as answering brokers' questions similarly  can be viewed as\r\n\nassisting the insurer  in publicizing the plan.  Other activities\r\n\nthat  arguably fall closer  to the line, such  as the tracking of\r\n\neligibility   status,   are   completely  compatible   with   the\r\n\nregulation's aims.   Under the circumstances,  the court lawfully\r\n\ncould  find that the employer's activities, in the aggregate, did\r\n\nnot take the case out of  the safe harbor.5  See, e.g., Brundage-\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Appellants stress the fact that Watts unilaterally prepared\r\nand filed a Form 5500 with the Internal Revenue Service.  This is\r\nan  example of the mountain laboring, but bringing forth a mouse.\r\nSuch forms are informational in nature and are designed to comply\r\nwith  various reporting  requirements  that ERISA  imposes.   See\r                                                                           \r\nCooke,  supra,   3.10, at  3-34.   But, there  is no  evidence to\r                       \r\nsuggest that Watts' employees knew of this protective filing, and\r\nit  is surpassingly  difficult for  us to  fathom how  the filing\r\nmakes  a dispositive  difference.   Although  the inference  that\r\ncompiling the tax form  demonstrated Watts' intent to provide  an\r\nERISA  plan does not  escape us, but  cf. Kanne, 867  F.2d at 493\r                                                         \r\n(explaining  that a brochure describing  a plan as  an ERISA plan\r\nevidences the intent of the employer to create an ERISA plan, but\r\nthe same may  not be said of the  filing of a tax return),  it is\r\nentirely  possible, as the plaintiff  suggests, that the form was\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nPeterson,  877   F.2d  at  510  (assuming  that   steps  such  as\r                  \r\n\n\"distributing advertising brochures from insurance  providers, or\r\n\nanswering  questions  of its  employees concerning  insurance, or\r\n\neven  deducting  the  insurance  premiums  from   its  employees'\r\n\npaychecks and  remitting  them to  the  insurers,\" do  not  force\r\n\nemployers out of the  safe harbor provision); du Mortier,  805 F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp.  at 821 (holding that activities such as maintaining a file\r\n\nof informational materials, distributing  forms to employees, and\r\n\nsubmitting completed forms  to the insurer, do  not transcend the\r\n\nboundaries of the safe harbor).\r\n\n          In arguing  for reversal, appellants rely  on Hansen v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nContinental  Ins. Co., a case that  involved a similar situation.\r                               \r\n\nIn  Hansen, as here, participation in the plan was voluntary, and\r                    \r\n\npremiums were paid by  the employees via payroll deduction.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHansen,  940 F.2d at 973.   The employer  collected the premiums,\r                \r\n\nremitted them to the  insurer, and employed an  administrator who\r\n\naccepted  claim forms and transmitted  them to the  carrier.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  at 974.    In addition,  the  employees received  a  booklet\r             \r\n\nembossed with  the employer's  corporate logo that  described the\r\n\nplan and encouraged employee participation.  The court found that\r\n\nthe company had endorsed the plan.  See id.\r                                                     \r\n\n          Despite the resemblances, there  are two critical facts\r\n\nthat distinguish Hansen  from the case at bar.   First, in Hansen\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe corporate logo was  embossed on the booklet itself,  see id.,\r                                                                          \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nfiled merely as  a precaution.  In any event,  this case turns on\r\nthe employer's activities, not its intentions.\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nmaking  it  appear  that  the  employer  vouched  for  the entire\r\n\nbrochure (and for the  plan).  Here, however, only  Watts' letter\r\n\nbore its  imprimatur.    Second,  and perhaps  more  cogent,  the\r\n\nbooklet  at issue in Hansen described the policy as the company's\r                                     \r\n\nplan, see id. (\"our  plan\"), while here, the letter  typeset onto\r                       \r\n\nthe booklet describes  the policy  as a plan  offered by  another\r\n\norganization.6   Though the  appellants decry the  distinction as\r\n\nmerely  a matter  of semantics,  words  are often  significant in\r\n\ndetermining legal  rights and  obligations.  See  generally Felix\r                                                                     \r\n\nFrankfurter,  Some  Reflections on  the  Reading  of Statutes  29\r                                                                       \r\n\n(1947)  (\"Exactness  in the  use  of words  is the  basis  of all\r\n\nserious thinking.\").\r\n\n          In the difference  between \"our plan\" and \"a plan\" lies\r\n\nthe  quintessential meaning of endorsement.  If a plan or program\r\n\nis  the  employer's plan  or program,  the  safe harbor  does not\r\n\nbeckon.  See, e.g., Sorel v. CIGNA, 1994 WL 605726, at *2 (D.N.H.\r                                            \r\n\nNov.  1,  1994)  (holding  that statement  describing  policy  as\r\n\nemployer's  plan  on first  page  of  plan description  indicates\r\n\nendorsement); Cockey  v.

Although the  Hansen court did not articulate  its ratio\r                                                                           \r\ndecidendi, at least one district court has come to the conclusion\r                   \r\nthat Hansen  analyzed the  situation from  the standpoint  of the\r                     \r\nemployer  rather than the employee.

No. 94-26A, supra (advising that  safe harbor\r                                               \r\n\nis  unavailable  when  a  union, inter  alia,  describes  a group\r                                                      \r\n\ninsurance program as its  program).  When, however, the  employer\r\n\nseparates  itself from  the program,  making it  reasonably clear\r\n\nthat the program is a third  party's offering, not subject to the\r\n\nemployer's  control, then the safe harbor may be accessible.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHansen, 940 F.2d at 977; Kanne, 867 F.2d at 493;  Hensley, 878 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. at 1471.\r\n\n          This  distinction is  sensible.   When  an  objectively\r\n\nreasonable  employee reads  a  brochure describing  a program  as\r\n\nbelonging to his employer, he  is likely to conclude that, if  he\r\n\nparticipates,  he will be dealing  with the employer  and that he\r\n\nwill therefore enjoy the  prophylaxis that ERISA ensures  in such\r\n\nmatters.  When the possessive pronoun is eliminated in favor of a\r\n\nneutral article, however, the  employee's perception is much more\r\n\nlikely  to  be  that, if  he  participates,  he  will be  dealing\r\n\ndirectly with  a third party    the  insurer   and  that he  will\r\n\ntherefore be beyond the scope of ERISA's protections.\r\n\n          To sum up, we  are drawn to three conclusions.   First,\r\n\nthe district court did not clearly err in finding that Watts  had\r\n\nnot endorsed  the group insurance  program.  Second,  the court's\r\n\nfact-sensitive determination  that  the program  fits within  the\r\n\nparameters  of   the  Secretary's  safe   harbor  regulation   is\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nsustainable.   Third, since ERISA does not apply, the court below\r\n\ndid  not  blunder  in  scrutinizing  the  merits  of  plaintiff's\r\n\ncontract claim through the prism of state law.\r\n\nIII.  THE DISABILITY ISSUE\r          III.  THE DISABILITY ISSUE\r\n\n          Appellant asseverates  that, even if  New Hampshire law\r\n\ncontrols,  the judgment below is  insupportable.  We  turn now to\r\n\nthis asseveration.\r\n\n          The  starting point  for  virtually any  claim under  a\r\n\npolicy of insurance is  the policy itself.  Here,  the applicable\r\n\nrider promises benefits  to an insured who has been injured in an\r\n\naccident,  whose ensuing disability  is \"continuous\"  and \"total\"\r\n\nfor  a year, and who thereafter  remains \"permanently and totally\r\n\ndisabled.\"  The  rider defines \"continuous total disability\" as a\r\n\ndisability  resulting  from  injuries sustained  in  an accident,\r\n\n\"commencing within  180 days  after the  date  of the  accident,\"\r\n\nlasting for at least  a year, and producing during  that interval\r\n\n\"the  Insured's complete inability  to perform every  duty of his\r\n\noccupation.\"\r\n\n          If an insured meets this benchmark, he must then  prove\r\n\nthat  he is \"permanently and totally disabled.\"  Under the policy\r\n\ndefinitions,  this  phrase   signifies  \"the  Insured's  complete\r\n\ninability,  after one  year  of continuous  total disability,  to\r\n\nengage in an occupation or employment for which [he] is fitted by\r\n\nreason of education, training, or experience for the remainder of\r\n\nhis  life.\"   It  is against  this  linguistic backdrop  that  we\r\n\ninspect  appellants'  assertion that  the  trial  court erred  in\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nfinding plaintiff to be totally and permanently disabled.\r\n\n                     A.  Standard of Review.\r                               A.  Standard of Review.\r                                                     \r\n\n          In actions  that are tried  to the  court, the  judge's\r\n\nfindings  of fact  are to  be honored  unless  clearly erroneous,\r\n\npaying  due  respect  to  the judge's  right  to  draw reasonable\r\n\ninferences  and  to  gauge the  credibility  of  witnesses.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCumpiano,  902  F.2d  at 152  (citing  Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  52(a));\r                  \r\n\nReliance Steel Prods.  Co. v.  National Fire Ins.  Co., 880  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n575, 576 (1st  Cir. 1989).   A corollary of  this proposition  is\r\n\nthat, when there are  two permissible views of the  evidence, the\r\n\nfactfinder's choice  between  them cannot  be clearly  erroneous.\r\n\nSee Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574  (1985);\r                                               \r\n\nCumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152.  In fine, when a case has been decided\r                  \r\n\non the facts by  a judge sitting jury-waived, an  appellate court\r\n\nmust refrain  from any  temptation to  retry  the factual  issues\r\n\nanew.\r\n\n          There  are, of  course, exceptions  to  the rule.   For\r\n\nexample, de novo  review supplants clear-error review  if, and to\r\n\nthe  extent that, findings of  fact are predicated  on a mistaken\r\n\nview of  the law.  See,  e.g., United States v.  Singer Mfg. Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n374  U.S. 174,  195 n.9  (1963); RCI  N.E. Servs. Div.  v.

This does  not\r                    \r\n\nmean, however, that the clearly erroneous standard  can be eluded\r\n\nby the simple expedient  of creative relabelling.  See  Cumpiano,\r                                                                          \r\n\n902 F.2d  at 154; Reliance Steel,  880 F.2d at 577.

Analysis.\r                                                \r\n\n          Appellants   make  two  main  arguments  in  regard  to\r\n\nplaintiff's  disability claim.  First, in an effort to skirt Rule\r\n\n52(a),  they assert that the district court committed an error of\r\n\nlaw, mistaking the meaning of the phrase \"permanently and totally\r\n\ndisabled\" as  that phrase is used  in the policy.   We reject the\r\n\nassertion as  comprising nothing  more than  a clumsy  attempt to\r\n\nrecast a  clear-error challenge  as an issue  of law  in hope  of\r\n\nsecuring  a more welcoming standard of review.  The policy itself\r\n\ndefines  the operative term,  and the record  makes pellucid that\r\n\nthe district judge applied the term within the parameters of that\r\n\ndefinition.\r\n\n          Appellants' second contention posits that  the district\r\n\ncourt  misperceived  the  facts,   and  that  plaintiff  was  not\r\n\nsufficiently  disabled to  merit  an  award  of benefits.    This\r\n\ncontention also  lacks force.   The  district court  had adequate\r\n\ngrounds for  deciding that plaintiff was  totally and permanently\r\n\ndisabled.    The  evidence  showed  that  plaintiff  sustained  a\r\n\ndevastating brain injury, and that, throughout the year following\r\n\nhis accident, a number  of physicians found his disability  to be\r\n\ncontinuous.  By and large, plaintiff's  condition did not improve\r\n\nsignificantly during that year  (or thereafter, for that matter).\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nWithout  exception, the  doctors  concluded that  he could  never\r\n\nreturn to  work as a forklift driver.  To cap matters, the record\r\n\ncontains  ample  evidence  that  the plaintiff's  disability  was\r\n\npermanent  and blanketed  the  universe of  occupations to  which\r\n\nplaintiff   a laborer  with a high-school education    might have\r\n\naspired.\r\n\n          We  need not  cite  book and  verse.   The  court  made\r\n\ndetailed findings, crediting the  conclusions of four doctors who\r\n\njudged  plaintiff  to be  severely  impaired,  both mentally  and\r\n\nphysically.7  The court also credited an evaluation performed  by\r\n\nSherri  Krasner,  a  speech  and language  pathologist,  and  the\r\n\ntestimony  of  a   vocational  rehabilitation  counselor,  Arthur\r\n\nKaufman, who offered an opinion that plaintiff was unable to work\r\n\nwithout  constant supervision.   Kaufman stated  that he  did not\r\n\nknow  of a job suitable  for a person  in plaintiff's condition.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7These  experts   included  the  attending   physician  (Dr.\r\nMartino),    a   neurologist    (Dr.   Whitlock),    a   clinical\r\nneuropsychologist (Dr. Higgins), and  a psychologist (Dr.  Toye).\r\nA  fifth  physician,  Dr.  Michele  Gaier-Rush,   also  evaluated\r\nplaintiff.   CIGNA chose  Dr. Gaier-Rush as  its medical examiner\r\nbut neglected to  provide her with  any of plaintiff's  plentiful\r\nprior medical records, despite their availability.  She concluded\r\nthat  plaintiff could not perform his usual job but could perform\r\na job  \"requiring more  mental capacity than  physical capacity.\"\r\nShe noted, however, that plaintiff had no formal  training beyond\r\nhigh school,  and  conceded  that  \"[t]his  will  probably  be  a\r\npermanent  disability as  there  does not  seem  to have  been  a\r\nsignificant  improvement in  the past  year.\"   Consequently, she\r\nfound it doubtful that plaintiff could ever work again.\r\n\n     8While  Kaufman did say that  plaintiff might be  able to do\r\nsome gainful  employment with  \"excessive supervision,\" and  that\r\nplaintiff, like  other  patients with  traumatic brain  injuries,\r\nwould  probably benefit  from vocational  rehabilitation, Kaufman\r\nexpressed   doubt  that   plaintiff   would  ever   overcome  his\r\nimpairment.   In short, he lacked  the \"capacity to retain  . . .\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nOn  this record,  the trial court's  total disability  finding is\r\n\nunimpugnable.\r\n\n          Another wave of  appellants' evidentiary attack targets\r\n\nthe  district  court's  finding  that  plaintiff's disability  is\r\n\npermanent.    In  this  respect, appellants  rely  mainly  on the\r\n\nphysicians'   recommendations   for  rehabilitative   therapy  as\r\n\nindicative of the  potential for recovery.   The district  court,\r\n\nhowever, found appellants' inference unreasonable in light of the\r\n\ndim  prospects   for  significant   recovery,  the   duration  of\r\n\nplaintiff's  inability  to  work,  and the  policy's  failure  to\r\n\nrequire  vocational  rehabilitation  as  a  precondition  to  the\r\n\nreceipt of  benefits.  These  are fact-dominated issues,  and the\r\n\ntrial court is in  the best position to calibrate  the decisional\r\n\nscales.   See Cumpiano,  902 F.2d  at 152.   Having  examined the\r                                \r\n\nrecord with care, we have no reason to suspect that a mistake was\r\n\ncommitted.  See, e.g., Duhaime v. Insurance Co., 86 N.H. 307, 308\r                                                         \r\n\n(1933) (explaining  that, to be permanently  disabled, an insured\r\n\nneed not be in a condition of \"utter hopelessness\").\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go  no further.   ERISA does not  apply to  the\r\n\ngroup insurance  program at issue  here.  Moreover,  the district\r\n\ncourt's    factual    findings   survive    clear-error   review.\r\n\nConsequently, the court's resolution of the case stands.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nemployment.\"\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                26\r\r\n",

Determining, as we do, that the district\r\n\ncourt  appropriately applied  the regulation,  and  discerning no\r\n\nclear  error in the court's  factual findings on  other issues in\r\n\nthe case, we affirm the judgment below.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Plaintiff-appellee  James Johnson worked  as a forklift\r\n\noperator  at the  Webster  Valve division  of defendant-appellant\r\n\nWatts Regulator Co. (Watts) in Franklin, New Hampshire.  While so\r\n\nemployed, plaintiff  elected to participate in  a group insurance\r\n\nprogram made available to Watts' employees by defendant-appellant\r\n\nCIGNA Employee  Benefit Company  d/b/a Life Insurance  Company of\r\n\nNorth  America (CIGNA).    Under the  program plaintiff  received\r\n\ninsurance protection against accidental death, dismemberment, and\r\n\npermanent disability.   He  paid  the premium  through a  payroll\r\n\ndeduction plan.  Watts, in turn, remitted the premium payments to\r\n\nCIGNA.   \r\n\n          On  June 15, 1990, while  a participant in the program,\r\n\nplaintiff  sustained  a  severe   head  injury  in  a  motorcycle\r\n\naccident.  He remained disabled for the ensuing year, and, having\r\n\ncrossed the policy's temporal  threshold, he applied for benefits\r\n\non  July 17,  1991.   CIGNA  turned  him down,  claiming  that he\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nretained the residual capacity  to do some work.   Plaintiff then\r\n\nsued Watts and CIGNA in a New Hampshire state court.  Postulating\r\n\nthe  existence  of   an  ERISA-related   federal  question,   the\r\n\ndefendants removed the action to the district court.\r\n\n          Following  an evidentiary  hearing, the  district court\r\n\nruled that ERISA did not pertain.  See Johnson v. Watts Regulator\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.,  No.  92-508-JD,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>  <span class=\"page\">258788</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.N.H.  May  3,  1994).\r             \r\n\nNevertheless,  the court  denied  plaintiff's  motion to  remand,\r\n\nnoting diverse citizenship and the  existence of a controversy in\r\n\nthe  requisite amount.   See  28 U.S.C.    1332(a).   The parties\r                                      \r\n\nsubsequently tried the  case to the bench.   The judge heard  the\r\n\nevidence, perused  the group  policy, applied New  Hampshire law,\r\n\nfound  plaintiff  to be  totally  and  permanently disabled,  and\r\n\nawarded the  maximum benefit,  together with attorneys'  fees and\r\n\ncosts.

THE ERISA ISSUE\r\n\n          The  curtain-raiser  question  in  this  case  involves\r\n\nwhether  the  program  under  which Johnson  sought  benefits  is\r\n\nsubject to Title  I of  ERISA.  Confronting  this issue  requires\r\n\nthat  we   interpret  and  apply  the   Secretary's  safe  harbor\r\n\nregulation,  29 C.F.R.   2510.3-1(j) (1994).  We divide this part\r\n\nof our analysis into  four segments.   First, we explain why  the\r\n\ncurtain-raiser question matters.   Second, we limn the applicable\r\n\nstandard  of review.  Third, we discuss the regulation itself and\r\n\nhow it fits into the statutory and regulatory scheme.  Fourth, we\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nscrutinize the  record and  test the district  court's conclusion\r\n\nthat the program is within the safe harbor.\r\n\n                    A.  The ERISA Difference.\r                              A.  The ERISA Difference.\r                                                      \r\n\n          From   the  earliest  stages   of  the   litigation,  a\r\n\ncontroversy  has raged  over  the relationship,  if any,  between\r\n\nERISA  and the  group  insurance program  underwritten by  CIGNA.\r\n\nThis controversy  stems from  perceived self-interest:   if ERISA\r\n\napplies, preemption is  triggered, see 29 U.S.C.    1144(a), and,\r                                                \r\n\nin many situations, the substitution of ERISA principles (whether\r\n\nderived from the statute  itself or from federal common  law) for\r\n\nstate-law  principles  can make  a  pronounced  difference.

A  program  that  satisfies   the\r\n\nregulation's  standards   will  be   deemed  not  to   have  been\r\n\n\"established  or  maintained\" by  the  employer.

Applying this deferential  standard, we cannot say that\r\n\nthe trial court's \"no endorsement\" finding is clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          The   anatomy   of   the   court's   determination   is\r\n\ninstructive.

In those  cases, endorsement becomes  a question of\r\nfact.  This case is of the latter type.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nmade its  employees aware of the opportunity  to obtain coverage,\r\n\nbut  had stopped short of  endorsing the program.   CIGNA drafted\r\n\nthe  policy and,  presumably,  set the  premium rates.   Although\r\n\nWatts  distributed the sales brochure, waiver-of-insurance cards,\r\n\nand enrollment cards, those efforts were undertaken to help CIGNA\r\n\npublicize the program; the documents themselves were prepared and\r\n\nprinted  by CIGNA, and delivered by it to Watts for distribution.\r\n\nWatts recommended enrollment via a cover letter (reproduced as an\r\n\nappendix hereto)  written on  the letterhead of  Watts Industries\r\n\nand signed by  its vice-president for  financial matters.   CIGNA\r\n\ntypeset the letter and incorporated it into the cover page of the\r\n\nbrochure.   The letter explicitly informed  Watts' employees that\r\n\nthe enrollment  decision  was  theirs to  make.    Watts  nowhere\r\n\nsuggested that it had any  control over, or proprietary  interest\r\n\nin,  the group  insurance  program.   And,  finally, neither  the\r\n\nletter nor any other passage in the brochure mentioned ERISA.\r\n\n          The  district   court   also  examined   Watts'   other\r\n\nactivities concerning  the  program.   Watts  collected  premiums\r\n\nthrough  payroll  deductions,  remitted  the  premiums  to CIGNA,\r\n\nissued   certificates  to   enrolled  employees   confirming  the\r\n\ncommencement of  coverage, maintained  a list of  insured persons\r\n\nfor  its own records, and  assisted CIGNA in securing appropriate\r\n\ndocumentation when claims eventuated.   Watts' activities in this\r\n\nrespect consisted principally of filling out the employer portion\r\n\nof  the claim form,  inserting statistical information maintained\r\n\nin Watts' personnel  files (such as the insured's  name, address,\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nage,  classification, and  date  of hire),  making various  forms\r\n\navailable to  employees (e.g.,  claim forms),4 and  keeping track\r\n\nof  employee eligibility.   Watts would follow  up on  a claim to\r\n\ndetermine  its status, if CIGNA  requested that Watts  do so, and\r\n\nwould occasionally answer a broker's questions about a claim.  In\r\n\nsum, Watts  performed only  administrative  tasks, eschewing  any\r\n\nrole in the substantive aspects of  program design and operation.\r\n\nIt had no  hand in drafting the plan, working  out its structural\r\n\ncomponents,  determining  eligibility for  coverage, interpreting\r\n\npolicy  language, investigating, allowing and disallowing claims,\r\n\nhandling litigation, or negotiating settlements.\r\n\n          In  the last  analysis, the  district court  found that\r\n\nWatts' cover  letter fell  short of constituting  an endorsement.\r\n\nThe  court pointed out that  neither the letter  nor the brochure\r\n\nexpressly stated that the  employer endorsed the program.   Apart\r\n\nfrom the letter,  the court  concluded that  Watts had  performed\r\n\nonly ministerial activities,  and that these activities  (whether\r\n\nviewed alone or  in conjunction  with the cover  letter) did  not\r\n\nrise to the level of an endorsement.\r\n\n          We believe that  this finding deserves  our allegiance.\r\n\nDrawing permissible inferences from the evidence, the trial court\r\n\ncould  plausibly  conclude  on   this  scumbled  record  that  an\r\n\nobjectively reasonable employee would not have thought that Watts\r\n\nendorsed  the  group insurance  program.   Several considerations\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4CIGNA prepared  and  printed all  such  forms, and  sent  a\r\nsupply of forms to Watts.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nlead us in this direction.  We offer a representative sampling.\r\n\n          First, we think that  endorsement of a program requires\r\n\nmore  than  merely  recommending  it.    An  employer's  publicly\r\n\nexpressed opinion as to  the quality, utility and/or value  of an\r\n\ninsurance  plan, without  more,  while relevant  to (and  perhaps\r\n\nprobative of) endorsement, will  most often not indicate employer\r\n\ncontrol of the plan.   Second, the administrative  functions that\r\n\nWatts   undertook   fit   comfortably   within   the  Secretary's\r\n\nregulation.  Activities such  as issuing certificates of coverage\r\n\nand  maintaining a list of  enrollees are plainly  ancillary to a\r\n\npermitted function (implementing payroll deductions).  Activities\r\n\nsuch  as answering brokers' questions similarly  can be viewed as\r\n\nassisting the insurer  in publicizing the plan.  Other activities\r\n\nthat  arguably fall closer  to the line, such  as the tracking of\r\n\neligibility   status,   are   completely  compatible   with   the\r\n\nregulation's aims.   Under the circumstances,  the court lawfully\r\n\ncould  find that the employer's activities, in the aggregate, did\r\n\nnot take the case out of  the safe harbor.5  See, e.g., Brundage-\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Appellants stress the fact that Watts unilaterally prepared\r\nand filed a Form 5500 with the Internal Revenue Service.  This is\r\nan  example of the mountain laboring, but bringing forth a mouse.\r\nSuch forms are informational in nature and are designed to comply\r\nwith  various reporting  requirements  that ERISA  imposes.   See\r                                                                           \r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cooke,</span>  supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">,   3.10, at  3-34.

Here, however, only  Watts' letter\r\n\nbore its  imprimatur.    Second,  and perhaps  more  cogent,  the\r\n\nbooklet  at issue in Hansen described the policy as the company's\r                                     \r\n\nplan, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566021\"><a href=\"/opinion/566021/martin-hansen-cross-appellee-v-the-continental-insurance-company-and/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> (\"our  plan\"), </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">while here, the letter  typeset onto\r                       \r\n\nthe booklet describes  the policy  as a plan  offered by  another\r\n\norganization.6   Though the  appellants decry the  distinction as\r\n\nmerely  a matter  of semantics,  words  are often  significant in\r\n\ndetermining legal  rights and  obligations.  See  generally Felix\r                                                                     \r\n\nFrankfurter,  Some  Reflections on  the  Reading  of Statutes  29\r                                                                       \r\n\n(1947)  (\"Exactness  in the  use  of words  is the  basis  of all\r\n\nserious thinking.\").\r\n\n          In the difference  between \"our plan\" and \"a plan\" lies\r\n\nthe  quintessential meaning of endorsement.

When  an  objectively\r\n\nreasonable  employee reads  a  brochure describing  a program  as\r\n\nbelonging to his employer, he  is likely to conclude that, if  he\r\n\nparticipates,  he will be dealing  with the employer  and that he\r\n\nwill therefore enjoy the  prophylaxis that ERISA ensures  in such\r\n\nmatters.  When the possessive pronoun is eliminated in favor of a\r\n\nneutral article, however, the  employee's perception is much more\r\n\nlikely  to  be  that, if  he  participates,  he  will be  dealing\r\n\ndirectly with  a third party    the  insurer   and  that he  will\r\n\ntherefore be beyond the scope of ERISA's protections.\r\n\n          To sum up, we  are drawn to three conclusions.   First,\r\n\nthe district court did not clearly err in finding that Watts  had\r\n\nnot endorsed  the group insurance  program.  Second,  the court's\r\n\nfact-sensitive determination  that  the program  fits within  the\r\n\nparameters  of   the  Secretary's  safe   harbor  regulation   is\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nsustainable.   Third, since ERISA does not apply, the court below\r\n\ndid  not  blunder  in  scrutinizing  the  merits  of  plaintiff's\r\n\ncontract claim through the prism of state law.\r\n\nIII.  THE DISABILITY ISSUE\r          III.  THE DISABILITY ISSUE\r\n\n          Appellant asseverates  that, even if  New Hampshire law\r\n\ncontrols,  the judgment below is  insupportable.  We  turn now to\r\n\nthis asseveration.\r\n\n          The  starting point  for  virtually any  claim under  a\r\n\npolicy of insurance is  the policy itself.  Here,  the applicable\r\n\nrider promises benefits  to an insured who has been injured in an\r\n\naccident,  whose ensuing disability  is \"continuous\"  and \"total\"\r\n\nfor  a year, and who thereafter  remains \"permanently and totally\r\n\ndisabled.\"  The  rider defines \"continuous total disability\" as a\r\n\ndisability  resulting  from  injuries sustained  in  an accident,\r\n\n\"commencing within  180 days  after the  date  of the  accident,\"\r\n\nlasting for at least  a year, and producing during  that interval\r\n\n\"the  Insured's complete inability  to perform every  duty of his\r\n\noccupation.\"\r\n\n          If an insured meets this benchmark, he must then  prove\r\n\nthat  he is \"permanently and totally disabled.\"  Under the policy\r\n\ndefinitions,  this  phrase   signifies  \"the  Insured's  complete\r\n\ninability,  after one  year  of continuous  total disability,  to\r\n\nengage in an occupation or employment for which [he] is fitted by\r\n\nreason of education, training, or experience for the remainder of\r\n\nhis  life.\"   It  is against  this  linguistic backdrop  that  we\r\n\ninspect  appellants'  assertion that  the  trial  court erred  in\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nfinding plaintiff to be totally and permanently disabled.\r\n\n                     A.

First, in an effort to skirt Rule\r\n\n52(a),  they assert that the district court committed an error of\r\n\nlaw, mistaking the meaning of the phrase \"permanently and totally\r\n\ndisabled\" as  that phrase is used  in the policy.   We reject the\r\n\nassertion as  comprising nothing  more than  a clumsy  attempt to\r\n\nrecast a  clear-error challenge  as an issue  of law  in hope  of\r\n\nsecuring  a more welcoming standard of review.  The policy itself\r\n\ndefines  the operative term,  and the record  makes pellucid that\r\n\nthe district judge applied the term within the parameters of that\r\n\ndefinition.\r\n\n          Appellants' second contention posits that  the district\r\n\ncourt  misperceived  the  facts,   and  that  plaintiff  was  not\r\n\nsufficiently  disabled to  merit  an  award  of benefits.    This\r\n\ncontention also  lacks force.   The  district court  had adequate\r\n\ngrounds for  deciding that plaintiff was  totally and permanently\r\n\ndisabled.    The  evidence  showed  that  plaintiff  sustained  a\r\n\ndevastating brain injury, and that, throughout the year following\r\n\nhis accident, a number  of physicians found his disability  to be\r\n\ncontinuous.  By and large, plaintiff's  condition did not improve\r\n\nsignificantly during that year  (or thereafter, for that matter).\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nWithout  exception, the  doctors  concluded that  he could  never\r\n\nreturn to  work as a forklift driver.  To cap matters, the record\r\n\ncontains  ample  evidence  that  the plaintiff's  disability  was\r\n\npermanent  and blanketed  the  universe of  occupations to  which\r\n\nplaintiff   a laborer  with a high-school education    might have\r\n\naspired.\r\n\n          We  need not  cite  book and  verse.   The  court  made\r\n\ndetailed findings, crediting the  conclusions of four doctors who\r\n\njudged  plaintiff  to be  severely  impaired,  both mentally  and\r\n\nphysically.7  The court also credited an evaluation performed  by\r\n\nSherri  Krasner,  a  speech  and language  pathologist,  and  the\r\n\ntestimony  of  a   vocational  rehabilitation  counselor,  Arthur\r\n\nKaufman, who offered an opinion that plaintiff was unable to work\r\n\nwithout  constant supervision.   Kaufman stated  that he  did not\r\n\nknow  of a job suitable  for a person  in plaintiff's condition.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7These  experts   included  the  attending   physician  (Dr.\r\nMartino),    a   neurologist    (Dr.   Whitlock),    a   clinical\r\nneuropsychologist (Dr. Higgins), and  a psychologist (Dr.  Toye).\r\nA  fifth  physician,  Dr.  Michele  Gaier-Rush,   also  evaluated\r\nplaintiff.   CIGNA chose  Dr. Gaier-Rush as  its medical examiner\r\nbut neglected to  provide her with  any of plaintiff's  plentiful\r\nprior medical records, despite their availability.  She concluded\r\nthat  plaintiff could not perform his usual job but could perform\r\na job  \"requiring more  mental capacity than  physical capacity.\"\r\nShe noted, however, that plaintiff had no formal  training beyond\r\nhigh school,  and  conceded  that  \"[t]his  will  probably  be  a\r\npermanent  disability as  there  does not  seem  to have  been  a\r\nsignificant  improvement in  the past  year.\"   Consequently, she\r\nfound it doubtful that plaintiff could ever work again.\r\n\n     8While  Kaufman did say that  plaintiff might be  able to do\r\nsome gainful  employment with  \"excessive supervision,\" and  that\r\nplaintiff, like  other  patients with  traumatic brain  injuries,\r\nwould  probably benefit  from vocational  rehabilitation, Kaufman\r\nexpressed   doubt  that   plaintiff   would  ever   overcome  his\r\nimpairment.   In short, he lacked  the \"capacity to retain  . . .\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nOn  this record,  the trial court's  total disability  finding is\r\n\nunimpugnable.\r\n\n          Another wave of  appellants' evidentiary attack targets\r\n\nthe  district  court's  finding  that  plaintiff's disability  is\r\n\npermanent.    In  this  respect, appellants  rely  mainly  on the\r\n\nphysicians'   recommendations   for  rehabilitative   therapy  as\r\n\nindicative of the  potential for recovery.   The district  court,\r\n\nhowever, found appellants' inference unreasonable in light of the\r\n\ndim  prospects   for  significant   recovery,  the   duration  of\r\n\nplaintiff's  inability  to  work,  and the  policy's  failure  to\r\n\nrequire  vocational  rehabilitation  as  a  precondition  to  the\r\n\nreceipt of  benefits.  These  are fact-dominated issues,  and the\r\n\ntrial court is in  the best position to calibrate  the decisional\r\n\nscales.
