In March  1988, Wolf  opened cash  and margin\n\naccounts with Gruntal  at its branch  office in Portland,  Maine.\n\nWolf signed a Customer Agreement (\"Agreement\") which contained an\n\narbitration clause:  \"[a]ny  controversy  between  [Gruntal]  and\n\n[Wolf] arising out of or relating  to this contract or the breach\n\nthereof, shall be settled by  arbitration. . . .

Paragraph 17  further provided\n\nthat \"th[e]  agreement and its  enforcement would be  governed by\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n New York  law without giving effect to external  law.\"  Id.   17.\r                                                                     \n\nThereafter, between 1988  and 1990, a Gruntal  agent fraudulently\n\nmismanaged  Wolf's  accounts,  causing a  loss  approximating  $1\n\nmillion.\n\n          In December  1991,  Wolf initiated  the present  action\n\nagainst  Gruntal  in the  United  States District  Court  for the\n\nDistrict  of Maine.    The  complaint  asserted  seven  state-law\n\nclaims, as  well as  one federal claim  under the  Securities and\n\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.   78j(b); Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R.  \n\n                                3\r\r\n\n 240 (1993).1   Gruntal moved to stay the  district court proceed-\n\nings pending arbitration on all eight claims.  \n\n          The district court ruled that the arbitration clause in\n\nthe Agreement unambiguously permitted Wolf  to forego arbitration\r                                               \n\nand to litigate the Rule 10b-5 claim  in district court, but that\n\nthe seven state-law  claims were arbitrable.  Since  no party had\n\nsought to compel arbitration, however, the district court refused\n                    \r                              \n\n     1Rule  10b-5,  promulgated  pursuant  to  section  78(j)(b),\nprovides in pertinent part:\n\n     It shall  be unlawful for  any person, directly  or in-\n     directly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of\n     interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any nation-\n     al securities exchange,                                \n\n     (a)  to employ  any  device,  scheme,  or  artifice  to\n     defraud,\n\n     (b) to make any untrue  statement of a material fact or\n     to omit to state a  material fact necessary in order to\n     make  the statements made, in the  light of the circum-\n     stances under which they were made, not misleading, or\n\n     (c) to engage in any  act, practice, or course of busi-\n     ness which  operates  or would  operate as  a fraud  or\n     deceit upon any person, \n\n     in connection with the purchase  or sale of any securi-\n     ty.\n\n17 C.F.R.   240 (1993).  \n     The Rule  10b-5  claim  alleged  that  Gruntal's  fraudulent\nscheme  was  comprised  of three  basic  components:  (1) Gruntal\nmisrepresented  that its  investments would  comport  with Wolf's\nlow-risk investment objectives; (2) Gruntal fraudulently extended\nthe  one-month  term  of Wolf's  margin  account,  without Wolf's\nknowledge or  consent, in  order to  promote Gruntal's  interests\n(i.e., by  using Wolf's credit  to manipulate the price  of stock\r               \n(Secor/Novametrix)  in waging  its own  \"trading  war\"); and  (3)\nGruntal  repeatedly  concealed  the unauthorized  margin  account\nactivity  by  using  Wolf's investment  and  \"safekeeping\" assets\n(e.g.,  treasury bills) as  collateral for his  burgeoning margin\r               \naccount indebtedness to Gruntal. \n\n                                4\r\r\n\n to stay its proceedings on  the Rule 10b-5 claim pending arbitra-\n\ntion and the parties proceeded with discovery.  \n\n          In March 1993,  Wolf submitted a unilateral  demand for\n\narbitration on the seven state-law  claims; in December 1993,  he\n\nrecovered a  $200,000 arbitral  award against  Gruntal.   Gruntal\n\nthereafter  moved for  summary judgment  in  the district  court,\n\ncontending  that the final arbitral award on the state-law claims\n\nprecluded the Rule 10b-5 claim  under the doctrine of res judica-\r                                                                           \n\nta. \r            \n\n          The district court  granted summary judgment.   Wolf v.\r                                                                        \n\nGruntal &amp; Co., No. 91-426-P-H, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7627 (D. Me.\r                       \n\nMay 24,  1994).  It correctly concluded that the Rule 10b-5 claim\n\nand the seven  state-law claims arose out of  the same \"operative\n\nnucleus  of fact\"  (i.e., the  ongoing  account mismanagement  by\r                                  \n\nGruntal).  Id.  at *4 (citing Kale  v. Combined Ins. Co.  of Am.,\r                                                                          \n\n924  F.2d  1161, 1166  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  112 S.

As  \"Gruntal [had]  made  clear that  it would  accept\n\narbitration  of the  [Rule  10b-5]  claim,\"  the  district  court\n\nenvisioned no  \"jurisdictional obstacle\"  in the  event Wolf  had\n\nelected to  submit the Rule  10b-5 claim to arbitration.   Conse-\n\nquently,  the court  reasoned, the  final arbitral  award  on the\n\nstate-law  claims precluded  the Rule  10b-5  claim because  Wolf\n\n\"could have\" presented the federal  claim to arbitration.  Id. at\r                                                                        \n\n*5, 6-7 (citing Restatement (Second) of Judgments   84 (1982)).\r                                                           \n\n          Wolf argues that  he reasonably relied on  the district\n\ncourt's  retention of \"exclusive\"  (i.e., sole  and indefeasible)\r                                                  \n\n                                5\r\r\n\n jurisdiction over  the Rule  10b-5 claim  and, as  a consequence,\n\nthat he was victimized by  an unfair procedural ambush.  Although\n\nwe reject  Wolf's characterization,2  we hold  that the  district\n\ncourt erred  in  ruling that  the  federal securities  claim  was\n\nprecluded by the arbitral award on the state-law claims. \n\n                                II\r                                          II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\nA.

The  complaint  asserted  seven  state-law\n\nclaims, as  well as  one federal claim  under the  Securities and\n\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.   78j(b); Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R.  \n\n                                3\r\r\n\n 240 (1993).1   Gruntal moved to stay the  district court proceed-\n\nings pending arbitration on all eight claims.  \n\n          The district court ruled that the arbitration clause in\n\nthe Agreement unambiguously permitted Wolf  to forego arbitration\r                                               \n\nand to litigate the Rule 10b-5 claim  in district court, but that\n\nthe seven state-law  claims were arbitrable.  Since  no party had\n\nsought to compel arbitration, however, the district court refused\n                    \r                              \n\n     1Rule  10b-5,  promulgated  pursuant  to  section  78(j)(b),\nprovides in pertinent part:\n\n     It shall  be unlawful for  any person, directly  or in-\n     directly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of\n     interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any nation-\n     al securities exchange,                                \n\n     (a)  to employ  any  device,  scheme,  or  artifice  to\n     defraud,\n\n     (b) to make any untrue  statement of a material fact or\n     to omit to state a  material fact necessary in order to\n     make  the statements made, in the  light of the circum-\n     stances under which they were made, not misleading, or\n\n     (c) to engage in any  act, practice, or course of busi-\n     ness which  operates  or would  operate as  a fraud  or\n     deceit upon any person, \n\n     in connection with the purchase  or sale of any securi-\n     ty.\n\n17 C.F.R.   240 (1993).  \n     The Rule  10b-5  claim  alleged  that  Gruntal's  fraudulent\nscheme  was  comprised  of three  basic  components:  (1) Gruntal\nmisrepresented  that its  investments would  comport  with Wolf's\nlow-risk investment objectives; (2) Gruntal fraudulently extended\nthe  one-month  term  of Wolf's  margin  account,  without Wolf's\nknowledge or  consent, in  order to  promote Gruntal's  interests\n(i.e., by  using Wolf's credit  to manipulate the price  of stock\r               \n(Secor/Novametrix)  in waging  its own  \"trading  war\"); and  (3)\nGruntal  repeatedly  concealed  the unauthorized  margin  account\nactivity  by  using  Wolf's investment  and  \"safekeeping\" assets\n(e.g.,  treasury bills) as  collateral for his  burgeoning margin\r               \naccount indebtedness to Gruntal. \n\n                                4\r\r\n\n to stay its proceedings on  the Rule 10b-5 claim pending arbitra-\n\ntion and the parties proceeded with discovery.  \n\n          In March 1993,  Wolf submitted a unilateral  demand for\n\narbitration on the seven state-law  claims; in December 1993,  he\n\nrecovered a  $200,000 arbitral  award against  Gruntal.   Gruntal\n\nthereafter  moved for  summary judgment  in  the district  court,\n\ncontending  that the final arbitral award on the state-law claims\n\nprecluded the Rule 10b-5 claim  under the doctrine of res judica-\r                                                                           \n\nta. \r            \n\n          The district court  granted summary judgment.
