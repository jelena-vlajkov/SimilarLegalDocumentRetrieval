Claimant  Laura  E.  Lopez-Marrero\n                      \n\nappeals  from  the  judgment  of  the  district  court  which\n\naffirmed the  decision of the  Secretary of Health  and Human\n\nServices that  claimant was  not entitled to  Social Security\n\ndisability benefits.\n\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Claimant filed an  application for Social  Security\n\ndisability  benefits on June 6,  1989.  She  alleged an onset\n\ndate of October  15, 1988.   As disabilities  she listed  her\n\nnerves  and her  back.   She related  her impairments  to two\n\nfalls  at work.   An  administrative law  judge (ALJ)  held a\n\nhearing.  Claimant testified concerning her most recent work.\n\nFirst,  she  worked in  a  pharmaceutical  factory where  she\n\nmanually  checked and  counted the  gloves made  there.   She\n\nwould alternate between sitting and standing and only  had to\n\ncarry \"little\" things.   Next, she was employed as  an office\n\nworker; she took notes and answered the phone.\n\n          Claimant  stated that  she lives with  her husband.\n\nAfter  the accidents, she suffered pain in her left leg, left\n\nhip, left ankle and right  hand.  She uses a cane  because of\n\nthe pain in her legs.   She visits a doctor when in  pain and\n\ntakes Motrin.  She can sit and stand for twenty  minutes at a\n\ntime but has problems  walking.  She can lift  light objects.\n\nShe would like to work but cannot because of the problems she\n\nhas with her memory due to her nerves and because of the pain\n\nin  her lower  back,  coccidial  area  and  left  hip.    She\n\ndescribed her pain as  strong although sometimes the medicine\n\nhelps.  As for her nerves, she feels desperate and restless.\n\n          The   ALJ   first   determined    that   claimant's\n\nimpairments did not meet the listings.  Nonetheless, he found\n\nthat  there  existed  some limitations  in  her  work-related\n\nactivities  due to  both  her  exertional and  non-exertional\n\nconditions.   As  for claimant's  mental impairment,  the ALJ\n\nconcluded  that claimant was  only precluded  from performing\n\ncomplex tasks due  to some  deterioration in  her ability  to\n\nsustain   concentration.    Nonetheless,   she  retained  the\n\ncapacity  to  perform  simple  tasks that  were  routine  and\n\nrepetitive in nature.  He rejected the level of deterioration\n\ndescribed by claimant, finding that, under Avery v. Secretary\n                                                             \n\nof  Health and Human Services,  797 F.2d 19  (1st Cir. 1986),\n                             \n\nshe was only somewhat limited in social functioning and daily\n\nactivities.\n\n          In  relation to her neurological condition, the ALJ\n\nfound  that she suffered from lumbar strain and had a history\n\nof trauma  to her left hip, left ankle and right hand.  Under\n\nAvery, the ALJ credited claimant's complaints of pain only to\n     \n\nthe extent that  she was precluded  from doing heavy  lifting\n\nand  carrying  and from  standing  or  walking for  prolonged\n\nperiods of time.   Thus, he concluded, she could  perform her\n\npast work.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          On   appeal,   claimant  argues   that   the  ALJ's\n\ndeterminations  regarding  her  pain  were  not substantially\n\nsupported by the record.   Further, claimant asserts, the ALJ\n\nerred by translating, without the aid of a vocational expert,\n\nthe medical  evidence of claimant's physical impairments into\n\nfunctional  limitations on  her ability  to perform  her past\n\nwork.  As for her mental condition, claimant asserts that the\n\nALJ's decision was not supported by substantial evidence when\n\nviewed  in   the  context   of  the   record   as  a   whole.\n\nSpecifically,  claimant points  to  the  findings  concerning\n\nrestrictions in her ability to cope with the stresses of work\n\nin general.  \n\n          A.  Physical Impairment\n                                 \n\n          The    x-ray    reports,   which    found   partial\n\nsacralization of  the L-5 disc  and narrowing of  the L-5-S-1\n\ndisc space, do provide evidence of \"a clinically determinable\n\nmedical impairment that can reasonably be expected to produce\n\nthe pain  alleged.\"   See Avery, 797  F.2d at  21.   However,\n                               \n\nthere  also was evidence to support the ALJ's decision not to\n\ncredit claimant's claims of totally disabling pain.\n\n          For example, in November 1989, claimant underwent a\n\nneurological  evaluation.     See  Exhibit   15.     Although\n                                 \n\nclaimant's complaints included constant pain, she  had normal\n\ntone, no atrophy and a strength rating  of 4 out of 5.  There\n\nwas  no muscle  spasm and  no deformity.   The  diagnosis was\n\n                             -4-\n\nlumbar strain.  At  another examination in October  1990, see\n                                                             \n\nExhibit 22, claimant complained of mild lower back pain which\n\nwas alleviated  with Motrin.   Despite  the presence  of some\n\nmuscle  spasm and  a limited  range of  motion of  the lumbar\n\nspine, there was no muscle weakness or atrophy and no sensory\n\ndeficit; claimant's  gait was normal.   The  diagnosis was  a\n\nback condition by history, with no evidence of radiculapathy.\n\n          Contrary to claimant's  argument, the  ALJ did  not\n\nimpermissibly   translate   medical   data  into   functional\n\nlimitations.    Rather,  the  record  contained  two residual\n\nfunctional  capacity  (RFC)  forms.    In  December  1989,  a\n\nphysician opined that, based on the medical records, claimant\n\nhad  no  exertional, postural  or  other limitations.    In a\n       \n\nNovember  1990 RFC  assessment,  it was  noted that  claimant\n\ncould occasionally lift and  carry up to 50 pounds  and could\n\nfrequently  lift and carry 25  pounds.  She  could stand, sit\n\nand walk for up to six hours each per day.\n\n          B.  Mental Condition\n                              \n\n          Claimant's  mental  impairment   presents  a   more\n\ncomplicated picture but, again,  there is evidence to support\n\nthe   Secretary's  position.     A   psychiatric  examination\n\nconducted  in November  1989, see  Exhibit 16,  revealed that\n                                 \n\nclaimant was  logical, coherent, relevant and  oriented.  She\n\ndid not  present any  perceptual dysfunctions.   Although she\n\nappeared  anxious  and  depressed,  her  attention  span  was\n\n                             -5-\n\nconserved and her ability  to concentrate was adequate.   She\n\nwas  described   as  capable  of  judging   reality  and  the\n\nconsequences of her acts.\n\n          In  July  1990,  claimant  also  was  described  as\n\ncoherent, relevant,  logical and  cooperative; there were  no\n\nobservable thought  disorders.  See  Exhibit 18.   Her affect\n                                   \n\nwas appropriate and her mood normal.  She reported delusions,\n\nbut the examiner described them as hysterical in nature.  Her\n\nmemory was conserved.   In addition, claimant took the  MMPI.\n\nThe examiner  described the  results as \"exaggerated.\"   That\n\nis,  claimant \"reported  symptoms of such  severe disturbance\n\nthat her  profile fell  outside the  maximum limits  that the\n\nprofile  was designed to measure.\"  As a result, \"[s]he would\n\nhave  been unlikely  to  be unable  [sic]  to take  the  test\n\nproperly  if  she  were  as  severely  disturbed  as she  was\n\nclaiming, and her  behavior during the  clinical part of  the\n\nexamination  was  in  sharp   contrast  with  her  claims  of\n\ndisturbance.\"    The  diagnoses  were mild  dysthymia  and  a\n\npersonality disorder with dependent and hysterical features.\n\n          Three  non-examining  doctors completed  mental RFC\n\nassessments.   In December  1989, claimant  was rated  as not\n\nsignificantly  limited  in  understanding,   remembering  and\n\ncarrying  out   short,   simple  instructions.     Also   not\n\nsignificantly  limited  were  her  abilities  to  sustain  an\n\nordinary  routine without  supervision, to make  simple work-\n\n                             -6-\n\nrelated  decisions,  to  relate  to co-workers,  to  maintain\n\nsocially appropriate  behavior and  to handle changes  in the\n\nwork  environment.    As  for  maintaining  concentration for\n\nextended   periods  of  time,  performing  within  a  regular\n\nschedule,  and  being able  to  complete  a normal  work-week\n\nwithout  interruptions  from psychologically-based  symptoms,\n\nclaimant  was  moderately limited.    She  was not  \"markedly\n\nlimited\"  in any areas.  The conclusion was that claimant was\n\ncapable of performing simple tasks on a sustained basis.\n\n          The  RFC  assessment   completed  in  August   1990\n\nessentially  reached the  same results.   Even  with moderate\n\nlimits on  her abilities to  complete a normal  work-week, to\n\nrespond appropriately to changes in the work setting, and  to\n\naccept supervision,  claimant retained the abilities  to cope\n\nwith simple  instructions, to  perform within a  schedule, to\n\nmake simple  work-related decisions, to work  in proximity to\n\nothers,  to sustain  an  ordinary work  routine, to  maintain\n\nregular attendance  and to be punctual.  The third physician,\n\nin November 1990, echoed  the findings concerning  claimant's\n\ncapacity  to  deal with  simple  instructions,  to work  with\n\nothers, to make simple, work-related decisions and to respond\n\nappropriately to  criticism.   She was moderately  limited in\n\ndealing with the stresses of work in general -- being able to\n\nconcentrate,  maintaining  a  routine   without  supervision,\n\n                             -7-\n\ncompleting  a  normal   work-week  and  keeping  up   regular\n\nattendance.\n\n          In   Social  Security   Ruling  (SSR)   85-15,  the\n\nSecretary   set  out  the  framework  for  addressing  mental\n\nimpairments in the context  of unskilled work.  See  Ortiz v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, 890 F.2d  520, 526-27\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir.  1989) (per  curiam) (discussing  SSR 85-15).   Two\n\nsets  of capabilities are  necessary for  this kind  of work.\n\nFirst,  claimant must  be  able to  understand, remember  and\n\ncarry out  simple instructions, to  respond appropriately  to\n\nco-workers,  supervision and  normal work situations,  and to\n\ncope  with routine changes in  the work situation.   There is\n\nsubstantial  evidence,  based  on  the  above  reports,  that\n\nclaimant meets these requirements.\n\n          The second set of capabilities concerns the demands\n\nof  any  work  environment,  regardless of  the  skill  level\n\ninvolved.  To be  able to accommodate a work setting  per se,\n\naccording to  SSR 85-15,  an individual  must  be capable  of\n\nbeing  punctual, attending  work  on a  consistent basis  and\n\nstaying  at work  for the  entire day.   The  RFC assessments\n\nuniformly  rated claimant  as \"moderately  limited\" in  these\n\nspheres  of  functioning.   We  have  acknowledged that  such\n\nlimitations  may  erode  the  occupational  base   \"at  least\n\nmarginally,  and possibly more so.\"   See Ortiz,  890 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n                             -8-\n\n527;  see also Irlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human\n                                                             \n\nServices, 955 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).\n        \n\n          In this case, we  believe that there is substantial\n\nrecord  evidence  to support  the  Secretary's decision  that\n\nclaimant's dysthymia did not significantly affect her ability\n                                          \n\nto successfully negotiate the work setting.  In  this regard,\n\nwe note  that  objective  medical evidence  --  the  MMPI  --\n\nindicates that claimant may be exaggerating her symptomology.\n\n                       III.  CONCLUSION\n                                       \n\n          We conclude that claimant has not met her burden of\n\nestablishing   that  her   impairments  precluded   her  from\n\nperforming her past work.  See Gray v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 369,\n                                              \n\n371  (1st Cir.  1985)  (per curiam).    \"We must  uphold  the\n\nSecretary's findings  . . .  if a reasonable  mind, reviewing\n\nthe evidence in  the record as  a whole, could  accept it  as\n\nadequate  to support [the  Secretary's] decision.\"  Rodriguez\n                                                             \n\nv.

Although the record  contains conflicting\n\nevidence,  the  resolution  of  these conflicts  is  for  the\n\nSecretary,  not the  courts.   See  id.   Given  the  medical\n                                       \n\nreports described  above, there  was substantial  evidence in\n\nthe record as a whole to support the Secretary's conclusion.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -9-\n",

As for claimant's mental impairment, the ALJ concluded that claimant was only precluded from performing complex tasks due to some deterioration in her ability to sustain concentration.  Nonetheless, she retained the capacity to perform simple tasks that were routine and repetitive in nature.  He rejected the level of deterioration described by claimant, finding that, under  Avery v.

Physical Impairment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The x-ray reports, which found partial sacralization of the L-5 disc and narrowing of the L-5-S-1 disc space, do provide evidence of \"a clinically determinable medical impairment that can reasonably be expected to produce the pain alleged.\"   See Avery, 797 F.2d at 21.  However, there also was evidence to support the ALJ's decision not to credit claimant's claims of totally disabling pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in November 1989, claimant underwent a neurological evaluation.  See Exhibit 15.  Although claimant's complaints included constant pain, she had normal tone, no atrophy and a strength rating of 4 out of 5. There was no muscle spasm and no deformity.  The diagnosis was lumbar strain.  At another examination in October 1990, see Exhibit 22, claimant complained of mild lower back pain which was alleviated with Motrin.  Despite the presence of some muscle spasm and a limited range of motion of the lumbar spine, there was no muscle weakness or atrophy and no sensory deficit;  claimant's gait was normal.  The diagnosis was a back condition by history, with no evidence of radiculapathy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to claimant's argument, the ALJ did not impermissibly translate medical data into functional limitations.  Rather, the record contained two residual functional capacity (RFC) forms.  In December 1989, a physician opined that, based on the medical records, claimant had no exertional, postural or other limitations.  In a November 1990 RFC assessment, it was noted that claimant could occasionally lift and carry up to 50 pounds and could frequently lift and carry 25 pounds.  She could stand, sit and walk for up to six hours each per day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Mental Condition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant's mental impairment presents a more complicated picture but, again, there is evidence to support the Secretary's position.  A psychiatric examination conducted in November 1989, see Exhibit 16, revealed that claimant was logical, coherent, relevant and oriented.  She did not present any perceptual dysfunctions.  Although she appeared anxious and depressed, her attention span was conserved and her ability to concentrate was adequate.  She was described as capable of judging reality and the consequences of her acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1990, claimant also was described as coherent, relevant, logical and cooperative;  there were no observable thought disorders.  See Exhibit 18.  Her affect was appropriate and her mood normal.  She reported delusions, but the examiner described them as hysterical in nature.  Her memory was conserved.  In addition, claimant took the MMPI.  The examiner described the results as \"exaggerated.\"  That is, claimant \"reported symptoms of such severe disturbance that her profile fell outside the maximum limits that the profile was designed to measure.\"  As a result, \"[s]he would have been unlikely to be unable [sic] to take the test properly if she were as severely disturbed as she was claiming, and her behavior during the clinical part of the examination was in sharp contrast with her claims of disturbance.\"  The diagnoses were mild dysthymia and a personality disorder with dependent and hysterical features.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three non-examining doctors completed mental RFC assessments.  In December 1989, claimant was rated as not significantly limited in understanding, remembering and carrying out short, simple instructions.  Also not significantly limited were her abilities to sustain an ordinary routine without supervision, to make simple work-related decisions, to relate to co-workers, to maintain socially appropriate behavior and to handle changes in the work environment.  As for maintaining concentration for extended periods of time, performing within a regular schedule, and being able to complete a normal work-week without interruptions from psychologically-based symptoms, claimant was moderately limited.  She was not \"markedly limited\" in any areas.  The conclusion was that claimant was capable of performing simple tasks on a sustained basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RFC assessment completed in August 1990 essentially reached the same results.  Even with moderate limits on her abilities to complete a normal work-week, to respond appropriately to changes in the work setting, and to accept supervision, claimant retained the abilities to cope with simple instructions, to perform within a schedule, to make simple work-related decisions, to work in proximity to others, to sustain an ordinary work routine, to maintain regular attendance and to be punctual.  The third physician, in November 1990, echoed the findings concerning claimant's capacity to deal with simple instructions, to work with others, to make simple, work-related decisions and to respond appropriately to criticism.  She was moderately limited in dealing with the stresses of work in general-being able to concentrate, maintaining a routine without supervision, completing a normal work-week and keeping up regular attendance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Social Security Ruling (SSR) 85-15, the Secretary set out the framework for addressing mental impairments in the context of unskilled work.   See Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 890 F.2d 520, 526-27 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam) (discussing SSR 85-15).  Two sets of capabilities are necessary for this kind of work.  First, claimant must be able to understand, remember and carry out simple instructions, to respond appropriately to co-workers, supervision and normal work situations, and to cope with routine changes in the work situation.  There is substantial evidence, based on the above reports, that claimant meets these requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of capabilities concerns the demands of any work environment, regardless of the skill level involved.  To be able to accommodate a work setting per se, according to SSR 85-15, an individual must be capable of being punctual, attending work on a consistent basis and staying at work for the entire day.  The RFC assessments uniformly rated claimant as \"moderately limited\" in these spheres of functioning.  We have acknowledged that such limitations may erode the occupational base \"at least marginally, and possibly more so.\"   See Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 527;  see also Irlanda Ortiz v.  Secretary of Health and Human Services, 955 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we believe that there is substantial record evidence to support the Secretary's decision that claimant's dysthymia did not significantly affect her ability to successfully negotiate the work setting.  In this regard, we note that objective medical evidence-the MMPI-indicates that claimant may be exaggerating her symptomology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that claimant has not met her burden of establishing that her impairments precluded her from performing her past work.   See Gray v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 369, 371 (1st Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  \"We must uphold the Secretary's findings ... if a reasonable mind, reviewing the evidence in the record as a whole, could accept it as adequate to support [the Secretary's] decision.\"   Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).  Although the record contains conflicting evidence, the resolution of these conflicts is for the Secretary, not the courts.  See id.  Given the medical reports described above, there was substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Secretary's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Lopez-Marrero appeals from the judgment of the district court which affirmed the decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that claimant was not entitled to Social Security disability benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant filed an application for Social Security disability benefits on June 6, 1989.  She alleged an onset date of October 15, 1988.  As disabilities she listed her nerves and her back.  She related her impairments to two falls at work.  An administrative law judge (ALJ) held a hearing.  Claimant testified concerning her most recent work.  First, she worked in a pharmaceutical factory where she manually checked and counted the gloves made there.  She would alternate between sitting and standing and only had to carry \"little\" things.  Next, she was employed as an office worker;  she took notes and answered the phone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant stated that she lives with her husband.  After the accidents, she suffered pain in her left leg, left hip, left ankle and right hand.  She uses a cane because of the pain in her legs.  She visits a doctor when in pain and takes Motrin.  She can sit and stand for twenty minutes at a time but has problems walking.  She can lift light objects.  She would like to work but cannot because of the problems she has with her memory due to her nerves and because of the pain in her lower back, coccidial area and left hip.  She described her pain as strong although sometimes the medicine helps.  As for her nerves, she feels desperate and restless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ first determined that claimant's impairments did not meet the listings.  Nonetheless, he found that there existed some limitations in her work-related activities due to both her exertional and non-exertional conditions.  As for claimant's mental impairment, the ALJ concluded that claimant was only precluded from performing complex tasks due to some deterioration in her ability to sustain concentration.  Nonetheless, she retained the capacity to perform simple tasks that were routine and repetitive in nature.  He rejected the level of deterioration described by claimant, finding that, under  Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1986), she was only somewhat limited in social functioning and daily activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In relation to her neurological condition, the ALJ found that she suffered from lumbar strain and had a history of trauma to her left hip, left ankle and right hand.  Under Avery, the ALJ credited claimant's complaints of pain only to the extent that she was precluded from doing heavy lifting and carrying and from standing or walking for prolonged periods of time.  Thus, he concluded, she could perform her past work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, claimant argues that the ALJ's determinations regarding her pain were not substantially supported by the record.  Further, claimant asserts, the ALJ erred by translating, without the aid of a vocational expert, the medical evidence of claimant's physical impairments into functional limitations on her ability to perform her past work.  As for her mental condition, claimant asserts that the ALJ's decision was not supported by substantial evidence when viewed in the context of the record as a whole.  Specifically, claimant points to the findings concerning restrictions in her ability to cope with the stresses of work in general.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.
