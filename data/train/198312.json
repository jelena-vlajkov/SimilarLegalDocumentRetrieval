BAIG,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n     APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n          FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n   [Hon. George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n       Boudin, Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJoseph M. Hamilton, with whom Mirick, O'Connell, DeMallie\r\n&amp; Lougee, LLP, were on the brief, for appellant.\r\nRobert R. Pierce for appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 4, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge. The New England Mutual Life\r\nInsurance Company (\"New England Mutual\") brought this action\r\npursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as\r\namended, 29 U.S.C.  1001-1461 (\"ERISA\"), to rescind disability\r\ninsurance coverage provided to Dr. Mirza W. Baig, alleging that\r\nBaig made misrepresentations on his application. Baig filed\r\ncounterclaims based on state law. New England Mutual moved for\r\nsummary judgment on the counterclaims, arguing that all such claims\r\nwere preempted by ERISA. Baig filed a cross-motion for summary\r\njudgment, arguing that his disability policy was not a \"plan\" to\r\nwhich ERISA applied, and, there being no other federal question\r\npresented, the district court consequently lacked subject matter\r\njurisdiction. The district court agreed with Baig and dismissed the\r\naction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). See New Eng. Mut. Life Ins.\r\nCo. v. Baig, 985 F. Supp. 11 (D. Mass 1997). We affirm.\r\n                          I.\r\nThe district court based its determination on the\r\nfollowing undisputed facts. Baig was hired by Cardiology Associates\r\nof Fall River, P.C., in 1992. At that time he was its only full-\r\ntime physician employee. Baig purchased an individual disability\r\npolicy from New England Mutual. The policy issued January 3, 1994,\r\nand covered Baig until it was rescinded on March 21, 1995. Baig\r\npurchased the policy directly from New England Mutual. He was\r\nlisted as the beneficiary and the policy owner. According to the\r\nterms of the policy, his coverage would not terminate if his\r\nemployment with Cardiology Associates ended, but rather would\r\ncontinue so long as Baig continued to make the premium payments.\r\nCardiology Associates' Practice Administrator made the initial\r\ninquiry with New England Mutual and forwarded an application to\r\nBaig, and later directly forwarded verification of Baig's income to\r\nNew England Mutual, but otherwise the initial purchase of insurance\r\nwas made without the intervention of Baig's employer. Baig paid the\r\npremiums directly. Pursuant to Baig's employment agreement,\r\nCardiology Associates reimbursed him for the premium payments.\r\nReimbursements were paid by Cardiology Associates only after Baig\r\nsubmitted his receipts; premium payments to New England Mutual were\r\nnever channeled through Cardiology Associates. There was no\r\n\"summary plan description\" describing benefits provided to Baig. No\r\nother employees of Cardiology Associates were insured by New\r\nEngland Mutual. After New England Mutual rescinded Baig's coverage,\r\nCardiology Associates purchased a group disability policy covering\r\nBaig and other employees from another insurer.\r\n                         II.\r\nA. Standard of Review\r\nThe existence of an ERISA plan is a mixed question of law\r\nand fact. See Belanger v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 71 F.3d 451, 453-54\r\n(1st Cir. 1995). \"[T]he district court's interpretation of the word\r\n'plan' as used in ERISA poses a question of law subject to de novo\r\nreview.\" Id. at 453. However, \"the court's inquiry into the nature\r\nand the scope of the benefits actually at issue . . . demands\r\nfactfinding, and is to that extent reviewable only for clear\r\nerror.\" Id.\r\n\nB. What constitutes a plan under ERISA?\r\nNew England Mutual asserts federal jurisdiction and\r\nfederal preemption pursuant to ERISA on the basis of its claim that\r\nBaig's disability insurance coverage constitutes a \"benefit plan\"\r\nunder ERISA. ERISA's statutory definition of a benefit plan states\r\nin part:\r\nThe terms \"employee welfare benefit plan\" and\r\n\"welfare plan\" mean any plan, fund, or program\r\nwhich was heretofore or is hereafter\r\nestablished or maintained by an employer . . .\r\nfor the purpose of providing for its\r\nparticipants or their beneficiaries, through\r\nthe purchase of insurance or otherwise, . . .\r\nbenefits in the event of sickness, accident,\r\ndisability, death or unemployment, . . . .\r\n\n29 U.S.C.  1002(1)(A) (emphasis added). Thus, a disability\r\ninsurance policy like the one at issue in this case will qualify as\r\nan \"employee welfare benefit plan\" and will be subject to the\r\nstrictures of ERISA if it has been established or maintained by an\r\nemployer. See 29 U.S.C.  1003(a). In determining whether a plan is\r\nestablished or maintained by an employer, we must look for \"the\r\nundertaking of continuing administrative and financial obligations\r\nby the employer to the behoof of employees or their beneficiaries.\"\r\nBelanger, 71 F.3d at 454.\r\nWe look to an employer's \"continuing administrative or\r\nfinancial obligations\" because such obligations implicate the\r\nfundamental policy concerns at the heart of the ERISA statutory\r\nscheme. These policy concerns can be grouped into two broad (and\r\nsometimes overlapping) categories: concerns for the protection of\r\nemployers, and concerns for the protection of employees. As to the\r\nformer, the Supreme Court has stated that \"Congress intended pre-\r\nemption to afford employers the advantages of a uniform set of\r\nadministrative procedures governed by a single set of regulations.\r\nThis concern only arises . . . with respect to benefits whose\r\nprovision by nature requires an ongoing administrative program to\r\nmeet the employer's obligation.\" Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne,\r\n482 U.S. 1, 11 (1987). A plan therefore exists under ERISA where\r\n\"periodic demands on [employer] assets . . . create a need for\r\nfinancial coordination and control\" on the part of the employer.\r\nId. at 12. More recently, the Court has stated that finding a plan\r\nrequires that the employer have at least \"some minimal, ongoing\r\n'administrative' scheme or practice . . . .\" District of Columbiav. Greater Wash. Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. 125, 130 n.2 (1992), quoted\r\nin Belanger, 71 F.3d at 454. ERISA was also designed to provide\r\nnumerous substantive protections to employees. \"ERISA's substantive\r\nprotections are intended to safeguard the financial integrity of\r\nemployee benefit funds, to permit employee monitoring of earmarked\r\nassets, and to ensure that employer promises are kept.\" Belanger,\r\n71 F.3d at 454 (citing Fort Halifax, 482 U.S. at 15).\r\nAlthough \"[t]here is no authoritative checklist that can\r\nbe consulted to determine conclusively if [benefits] rise to the\r\nlevel of [a] plan\" under ERISA, id. at 455, we will be inclined to\r\nfind a plan where there are elements that \"involve administrative\r\nactivity potentially subject to employer abuse,\" Fort Halifax, 482\r\nU.S. at 16. A mere purchase of insurance by an employer is not\r\nsufficient to establish a plan under ERISA. See Wickman, 908 F.2d\r\nat 1082. Where insurance has been purchased by an employer, the\r\n\"crucial factor in determining if a 'plan' has been established is\r\nwhether the purchase of the insurance policy constituted an\r\nexpressed intention by the employer to provide benefits on a\r\nregular and long term basis.\" Id. at 1083. Similarly, whether a\r\n\"reasonable employee would perceive an ongoing commitment by the\r\nemployer to provide employee benefits\" is an important\r\nconsideration. Belanger, 71 F.3d at 455.\r\n\nC. Was Baig's disability coverage a \"plan\" under ERISA? \r\nNew England Mutual argues that an employer's\r\nreimbursement of premiums paid directly by an employee should\r\nconstitute substantial evidence of the existence of an ERISA plan.\r\nThe policy at issue here was not initially established by a\r\ncontractual arrangement between Cardiology Associates and New\r\nEngland Mutual; rather, Baig made the initial purchase directly.\r\nBaig paid the premiums directly to New England Mutual. The policy\r\nwas an individual policy covering only Baig himself. Under these\r\nparticular circumstances, the reimbursement by his employer of\r\npremiums paid directly by Baig did not create a plan under ERISA.\r\nAs the district court stated:\r\n     When an employer deals directly with\r\nthe insurer and actually purchases an\r\ninsurance policy for an employee, there may be\r\nsufficient participation to meet the\r\n\"established or maintained\" requirement under\r\nERISA. On the other hand, an employer who\r\nsimply pays its employees enough so that the\r\nemployees are encouraged on their own to buy\r\ninsurance policies could not be thought to\r\nhave established or maintained any policy that\r\nany individual employee might purchase. Cash\r\nreimbursement after the fact presents no\r\ndifferent case.\r\n\nBaig, 985 F. Supp. at 14. Even where an employer actually purchases\r\nan insurance policy, or makes payments directly, there may not be\r\na \"plan\" for ERISA purposes. In this case even these elements are\r\nabsent, and nothing else about the coverage at issue implicates any\r\nof the policy concerns underlying ERISA. The administrative burdens\r\non Cardiology Associates were nearly nonexistent, and its financial\r\nobligations were limited to after-the-fact reimbursement, such that\r\nthere was little chance for abuse, carelessness or misappropriation\r\nof funds of the sort that might escape Baig's oversight or threaten\r\nhis benefits.\r\nNew England Mutual also argues that Cardiology Associates\r\nevidenced its \"intention . . . to provide benefits on a regular and\r\nlong term basis,\" Wickman, 908 F.2d at 1083, by the terms of Baig's\r\nemployment agreement, which required Cardiology Associates to\r\nprovide disability coverage for Baig, and by the fact that after\r\nNew England Mutual rescinded Baig's policy, Cardiology Associates\r\npurchased a group disability policy covering Baig and other\r\nemployees. In Wickman we stated that if an employer's \"purchase of\r\nthe insurance policy constituted an express intention by the\r\nemployer to provide benefits on a regular and long term basis,\"\r\nsuch intention would be a \"crucial factor\" in determining the\r\nexistence of a plan. Id. Where there is such a purchase, evidence\r\ndemonstrating the express intention of an employer to provide\r\ncontinuing benefits is among those \"factors [which] tend to be more\r\nindicative of the existence of a plan than others.\" Belanger, 71\r\nF.3d at 455. Here, however, the employer did not purchase the\r\ninsurance. Indeed, the policy itself did not bear any relationship\r\nto Baig's employment, and would have continued in effect as long as\r\nBaig continued to pay the premiums, regardless of any changes in\r\nhis employment situation. Moreover, Cardiology Associates' post-hoc\r\nactions provide, at most, only limited evidence of its intent,\r\nunder Wickman, to cover Baig on a regular and long term basis at\r\nthe time the policy with New England Mutual was purchased.\r\nWe conclude based on the undisputed facts of this case\r\nthat the district court correctly found that Baig's disability\r\ninsurance coverage was not an \"employee welfare benefit plan\"\r\ngoverned by ERISA. Because there was no other basis claimed for\r\nfederal subject matter jurisdiction, the district court properly\r\ndismissed the case.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Even where an employer actually purchases\r\nan insurance policy, or makes payments directly, there may not be\r\na \"plan\" for ERISA purposes. In this case even these elements are\r\nabsent, and nothing else about the coverage at issue implicates any\r\nof the policy concerns underlying ERISA. The administrative burdens\r\non Cardiology Associates were nearly nonexistent, and its financial\r\nobligations were limited to after-the-fact reimbursement, such that\r\nthere was little chance for abuse, carelessness or misappropriation\r\nof funds of the sort that might escape Baig's oversight or threaten\r\nhis benefits.\r\nNew England Mutual also argues that Cardiology Associates\r\nevidenced its \"intention . . . to provide benefits on a regular and\r\nlong term basis,\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wickman,</span> <span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1083</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, by the terms of Baig's\r\nemployment agreement, which required Cardiology Associates to\r\nprovide disability coverage for Baig, and by the fact that after\r\nNew England Mutual rescinded Baig's policy, Cardiology Associates\r\npurchased a group disability policy covering Baig and other\r\nemployees. In Wickman we stated that if an employer's \"purchase of\r\nthe insurance policy constituted an express intention by the\r\nemployer to provide benefits on a regular and long term basis,\"\r\nsuch intention would be a \"crucial factor\" in determining the\r\nexistence of a plan. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Where there </span><pre class=\"inline\">is such a purchase, evidence\r\ndemonstrating the express intention of an employer to provide\r\ncontinuing benefits is among those \"factors [which] tend to be more\r\nindicative of the existence of a plan than others.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709201\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Belanger,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/709201/edmund-h-belanger-v-wyman-gordon-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Here, however, the employer did not purchase the\r\ninsurance. Indeed, the policy itself did not bear any relationship\r\nto Baig's employment, and would have continued in effect as long as\r\nBaig continued to pay the premiums, regardless of any changes in\r\nhis employment situation. Moreover, Cardiology Associates' post-hoc\r\nactions provide, at most, only limited evidence of its intent,\r\nunder Wickman, to cover Baig on a regular and long term basis at\r\nthe time the policy with New England Mutual was purchased.\r\nWe conclude based on the undisputed facts of this case\r\nthat the district court correctly found that Baig's disability\r\ninsurance coverage was not an \"employee welfare benefit plan\"\r\ngoverned by ERISA. Because there was no other basis claimed for\r\nfederal subject matter jurisdiction, the district court properly\r\ndismissed the case.\r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
