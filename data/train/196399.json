Defendant-\r\n\nappellant  Michael Olude advances a lone assignment of error.  He\r\n\nclaims that he  was merely a minor participant in  the offense of\r\n\nconviction,  and that the lower court erred in refusing to reduce\r\n\nhis  offense level accordingly.   See U.S.S.G.  3B1.2(b).   We do\r                                               \r\n\nnot agree.\r\n\n          Absent a mistake of law   and we discern none here   we\r\n\nreview a  district court's  factual findings anent  a defendant's\r\n\nrole in the offense only  for clear error.  See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAkitoye,  923 F.2d  221, 227  (1st Cir.  1991); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nOcasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir. 1990).  Although  this is not\r                \r\n\nan  insurmountable hurdle, it is nevertheless a daunting one.  As\r\n\nwe  have  said before,  battles over  a  defendant's role  in the\r\n\noffense are fact-based and, therefore, \"will almost always be won\r\n\nor lost  in the district  court.\"  United States  v. Graciani, 61\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 70,  75 (1st Cir. 1995).  There  is no basis for a different\r\n\nresult here.\r\n\n          We will  not belabor  the obvious.   See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.  Ruiz-Garcia,  886  F.2d  474,  477  (1st  Cir.  1989)\r                                 \r\n\n(warning, in a  sentencing appeal, that an appellate court should\r\n\nnot \"wast[e]  overtaxed judicial resources razing  castles in the\r\n\nair\").  The appellant  had the burden of proving  his entitlement\r\n\nto a  downward role-in-the-offense  adjustment.  See  Ocasio, 914\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  332-33.    In  determining  whether  the  appellant  had\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nsatisfied that burden, the sentencing court was not obligated  to\r\n\naccept   the   appellant's   self-interested   account   of   his\r\n\ninvolvement.  See United  States v. Paz-Uribe, 891 F.2d  396, 399\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st  Cir.), cert. denied, 495  U.S. 951 (1990).   And, moreover,\r                                   \r\n\neven if, as appellant claims, he was merely a courier, he was not\r\n\nautomatically   entitled   to   a  downward   role-in-the-offense\r\n\nadjustment.    See, e.g.,  United States  v. Lopez-Gil,  965 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1124, 1131 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 484 (1992); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Cepeda, 907 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                          \r\n\n          We need  go no further.   Though appellant, represented\r\n\non appeal by able counsel,  presents a somewhat sympathetic case,\r\n\nhe has not  overcome the  formidable standard of  review.   After\r\n\nall, in the world  of guideline sentencing, \"where there  is more\r\n\nthan  one plausible  view  of the  circumstances, the  sentencing\r\n\ncourt's choice  among supportable alternatives cannot  be clearly\r\n\nerroneous.\"  United  States v.
