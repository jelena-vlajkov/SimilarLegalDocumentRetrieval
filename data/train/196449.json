Plaintiff-appellee  Susan Hayes\r\n\nargues that under Johnson v. Jones,      U.S.    , 115 S. Ct.\r                                              \r\n\n2151 (1995), this court lacks appellate jurisdiction.\r\n\n          Paradis has raised two issues on appeal.  The first\r\n\nissue is  a  purely legal  one:   whether in  1991, when  the\r\n\nchallenged conduct occurred, there was a clearly  established\r\n\nright  under  the  fourteenth  amendment's  equal  protection\r\n\nclause to be  free from sex discrimination  in the workplace.\r\n\nUnder Johnson,  \"a district  court's pretrial rejection  of a\r                         \r\n\nproffered  qualified  immunity  defense  remains  immediately\r\n\nappealable  as a collateral order to the extent that it turns\r\n\non a pure issue  of law . . .  .\"  Stella v.

Exercising\r\n\nthis jurisdiction, we  summarily affirm the  district court's\r                                                   \r\n\npurely  legal   determination  that,  at  the   time  of  the\r\n\nchallenged conduct, there existed a clearly established right\r\n\nunder the  fourteenth amendment's equal protection  clause to\r\n\nbe  free from  sex  discrimination  in  the workplace.    See\r                                                                         \r\n\nLipsett v.  University of Puerto  Rico, 864 F.2d  881, 884-85\r                                                  \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1988)  (holding  that sex-based  discrimination is\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nactionable under 42 U.S.C.   1983 as a violation of the equal\r\n\nprotection clause). \r\n\n          Paradis' second  argument on appeal  is as follows:\r\n\neven if there was  a clearly established constitutional right\r\n\nto be  free from sex  discrimination in the  workplace, \"[i]t\r\n\ncannot  be   said  that   Paradis'  action   was  objectively\r\n\nunreasonable    given    the   extraordinary    circumstances\r\n\nconfronting him.\"   Although cloaked as a purely legal issue,\r\n\nthis   argument  is  actually   fact-based.    The  objective\r\n\nreasonableness of Paradis' conduct (under clearly established\r\n\nlaw) will necessarily turn on an  issue of fact:  whether the\r\n\nconduct  was  motivated by  sex-based  animus.   See  Poe  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHaydon,  853 F.2d 418, 431 (6th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  1007  (1989).    Under  Johnson,  \"a  district  court's\r                                                 \r\n\npretrial  rejection of  a qualified  immunity defense  is not\r\n\nimmediately appealable to the extent that  it turns on . .  .\r\n\nan issue of fact . . . .\"  Stella, supra, at 6-7.  Therefore,\r                                                    \r\n\nwe lack jurisdiction to  consider the second issue raised  by\r\n\nthis appeal.\r\n\n          Affirmed in  part, dismissed in part,  and remanded\r                                                                         \r\n\nfor further proceedings.
