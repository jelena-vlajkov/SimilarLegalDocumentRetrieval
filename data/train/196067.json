This is a petition\r                                                   \n\nby National Surface Cleaning, Inc. to review and set aside an\n\norder of the  National Labor Relations Board  finding that it\n\nunlawfully  discharged  employees  Humberto   Yeppes,  Carlos\n\nSilva,  Libardo  Quintero,  and  Jairo and  Cesar  Duque,  in\n\nviolation of  Section 8(a)(4) and  (1) of the  National Labor\n\nRelations Act, 29 U.S.C.   158(a)(4) and (1).  In re National\r                                                                         \n\nSurface Cleaning, 314 NLRB No. 92 (July 28, 1994).  The Board\r                            \n\nfound National  violated the Act by notifying Yeppes on March\n\n13,  1993  that he  would never  work  for the  company again\n\nbecause  of  having filed  an  unfair  labor practice  charge\n\nagainst  it on  March 2,  1993, and  by discharging  the four\n\nothers for assisting or  supporting him.  National's position\n\nis that (1) substantial evidence does not support the Board's\n\nfinding as  to Yeppes  because  he was  let go  prior to  its\n\nlearning of  the charge,  (2) the Board  misconstrued section\n\n8(a)(4)  in  ruling  that  it protects  the  others,  and (3)\n\nignored evidence indicating National's actions were in no way\n\nbased upon the charge.\n\n          Background\r                                \n\n          National is engaged in  asbestos removal at various\n\nsites  in and  around New York.   At  each site  it employs a\n\nproject  manager, foremen,  and  a crew  of asbestos  removal\n\nworkers,  members of  the  Mason Tenders  Union.   Typically,\n\nthese workers are hired on a  project by project basis.  They\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nmay be laid off for some time, and recalled when required.\n\n          As of  February 1992  the employees in  the present\n\ncase were all working at  1411 Broadway under project manager\n\nPablo Ortega.   On February  21, Ortega laid  off the  entire\n\ncrew,1 with  the exception of  five employees who  he brought\n\nto a new  project at the Grace building.   Some of those laid\n\noff  believed  they  were not  transferred  because  National\n\nintended to complete the Grace job with non-union workers.\n\n          On March 2, 1992, Yeppes visited the Grace building\n\nand thanked Ortega for having employed  him at 1411 Broadway,\n\nbut  Ortega did not  offer him work  at the new  site.  Later\n\nthat day, Yeppes  filed an unfair labor  practice charge with\n\nthe Board,  alleging National laid off its  employees at 1411\n\nBroadway and did not recall them to the Grace site because of\n\ntheir  union membership.  Around  March 5 Yeppes  and some of\n\nthe others also complained to the union local.  On March 6 or\n\n7,  Ortega called Quintero and asked him to contact the group\n\nwho  had been laid  off from 1411  Broadway and tell  them to\n\nreport  to work  at the  Grace building  on Monday,  March 9.\n\nQuintero  complied,  but  did  not  call  Yeppes  because  he\n\nregarded Yeppes  as a supervisor2 and  therefore not included\n\nin the group.  On March 9, all except Yeppes began working at\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  There  was some dispute as to whether Yeppes was laid off\nat this time or sometime prior to the others.\n\n2.  Yeppes had at times been employed as a project manager.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nthe Grace site.\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          National  received Yeppes' Board complaint on March\n\n9, and  Ortega testified to hearing  about it by  March 10 or\n\n11.   However, a union  representative had visited  the Grace\n\nsite to check union cards sometime before March 9.3\n\n          On March 12, foreman  Javiar Alzate told  Quintero,\n\nSilva  and the Duque brothers upon their arrival at work that\n\nthey should not  begin and to wait for  Ortega.  According to\n\nthe employees, when Ortega arrived he accused  them of filing\n\na  complaint against him, which  they denied.   He claimed to\n\nhave seen Yeppes' name on a complaint but admitted he had not\n\nseen  the others'  names.   He then  told them  they were  no\n\nlonger needed at the Grace building but might be able to find\n\nwork at  100 Wall  Street or  1411 Broadway.   He also  asked\n\nJairo Duque to talk to Yeppes.  Ortega testified that he laid\n\nthem off because they had been  late to work on March 12 (and\n\nJairo Duque had  missed several days  that week) and  because\n\nthey  never showed up at 1411 Broadway,4 but it is undisputed\n\nthat the only subject  he discussed with them on  the morning\n\nof the 12th was the complaint.  Later that day foreman Alzate\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  The  testimony of  Jairo Duque  suggests that  Ortega was\nprompted  to recall the laid off workers after the union shop\nsteward visited the building.\n\n4.  Ortega  testified that  he called  the Duque  brothers on\nFriday  evening, March  12, and  left a  message for  them to\nreport to 1411 Broadway the next day for a weekend job.  They\nclaim they were  never told.  They did go  to 100 Wall Street\non Monday, March  16, but  found no one  there and,  assuming\nOrtega had misled them, never went to the 1411 Broadway site.\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\ntold  two other employees that  a group could  no longer work\n\nfor  National because they had put in a complaint against the\n\ncompany.    The  brother of  one  of  the  employees, also  a\n\nforeman, told him the same thing.\n\n          On March  13 Ortega called  Yeppes and said  he had\n\nfound out about the  complaint and was upset that  Yeppes had\n\ncome to thank  him and then turned around  and filed a charge\n\nagainst him.  Yeppes  testified that Ortega then told  him he\n\nwould never work for  the company again.  Ortega  denied ever\n\nsaying  this.  Yeppes in  fact has never  worked for National\n\nagain,  and the other  four, despite efforts,  have also been\n\nunable to get themselves rehired.5\n\n                            Yeppes\r                                              \n\n          Section 8(a)(4)  of the  Act makes it  unlawful \"to\n\ndischarge  or  otherwise  discriminate  against  an  employee\n\nbecause he has  filed charges or  given testimony under  this\n\nAct.\"   N.L.R.A.   8(a)(4), 29 U.S.C.   158(a)(4).  The Board\n\nfound  Ortega's decision  not to  recall Yeppes to  the Grace\n\nbuilding along with the others on March 9 did not violate the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  Quintero once  sought work  at 1411 Broadway  with a  co-\nworker, the co-worker was  hired, but Quintero was told  by a\nsupervisor that  he had  been instructed  not to  hire anyone\ninvolved in the complaint against the company.  Another time,\nhe  had been under the  impression that he  had been rehired,\nbut when he showed up he  was informed he was not among those\nrecalled because  he was involved  in the complaint.   Ortega\neventually rehired  Silva for the 1411  Broadway weekend job,\nbut  we decline  to  disturb the  Board's  finding that  this\n\"simply represents . .  . that Ortega changed his  mind about\nSilva,\" and had no effect on the March 12 events.\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nAct, but that Ortega's March 13  communication with Yeppes to\n\nthe  effect  that he  would  never  work  for National  again\n\nbecause he had filed charges  against Ortega and the company,\n\ndid.  The question here is not whether   8(a)(4) applies, but\n\nwhether Yeppes was effectively discharged on March 13 because\n\nof the  charge, or for  unrelated reasons  sometime prior  to\n\nNational's (or Ortega's) awareness of the charge, as National\n\ncontends.\n\n          National  claims  the  evidence   establishes  that\n\nOrtega  never intended to recall Yeppes after he was laid off\n\nsometime  in February because he felt he could no longer work\n\nwith  Yeppes6 and  never  intended to  hire  him again.    It\n\ninsists that Yeppes had therefore been discharged well before\n\nit  became  aware  of   his  unfair  labor  practice  charge.\n\nNational points to the fact that on March 2 Yeppes sought out\n\nOrtega  and thanked  him for  having given  him work,  and to\n\nOrtega's testimony  that he was dissatisfied  with Yeppes and\n\nthat  it  was his  practice simply  to  never recall  such an\n\nemployee, rather than  to inform him  that he is  permanently\n\ndischarged, and  that all  of this conclusively  supports the\n\ninference that Yeppes had  been discharged effective prior to\n\nhis  ever having filed the charge.  It furthermore claims the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.  National  claims  Yeppes  had  repeated  difficulty  with\nOrtega, in large part because he had once been employed  as a\nsupervisor and  the younger  and less experienced  Ortega had\nworked under him.\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nBoard had no basis  for crediting Yeppes' testimony regarding\n\nOrtega's March 13 threat that Yeppes would never work for the\n\ncompany again when Ortega denied ever making it.\n\n          We are satisfied that the Board reasonably resolved\n\nthese credibility issues against National, and its conclusion\n\nthat the March 13  conversation transformed Yeppes' temporary\n\nlay off into permanent  discharge is supported by substantial\n\nevidence.  Universal Camera  Corp. v. NLRB, 341 U.S.  474, 71\r                                                      \n\nS.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).  The  Board found no evidence\n\nYeppes had  been permanently  discharged simply by  virtue of\n\nthe fact  that he was not  recalled along with the  others on\n\nMarch  9.   Further,  simply  because  Ortega had  difficulty\n\nworking  with Yeppes  does  not mean  other National  project\n\nmanagers  did  or would,  so  even  if Ortega  himself  never\n\nintended  to recall  Yeppes this  does not  mean he  had been\n\ndischarged  by   National.     Yeppes   had  completed   jobs\n\nsatisfactorily for other National supervisors, and had been a\n\nproject  manager himself prior to working for Ortega.  And if\n\nYeppes  had already  been permanently  discharged,  why would\n\nOrtega  need to tell him  on March 13,  while castigating him\n\nfor filing charges against him and the company, that he would\n\nnever  work  for  the  company  again,  as  the  Board found.\n\nFinally, there  was evidence that other  supervisors had been\n\ntold not to use  any of the employees associated  with filing\n\nthe  charge,  providing the  Board  with  reason to  conclude\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nOrtega's threat was neither fictional nor \n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nidle, and was  prompted by and  delivered in retaliation  for\n\nYeppes' having exercised his rights under the Act.\n\n                   The Four Other Employees\r                                                       \n\n          As to the other  four employees, the questions are,\n\nfirst, whether  they were discharged; second,  if so, whether\n\nthis was for being late  to work and not showing up  at a job\n\nto  which they  had  allegedly been  reassigned, as  National\n\ncontends, or because National believed  they had participated\n\nin  filing charges  under the  Act, as  the Board  found; and\n\nthird,  whether      8(a)(4)  prohibits   an  employer   from\n\ndischarging  or otherwise discriminating  against an employee\n\nfor believing  that he  \"supported\" or \"assisted\"  another in\n\nrelation to filing such charges against it.\n\n          Reasons for the Discharge\r                                               \n\n          The  Board  concluded   that  the  four  had   been\n\ndischarged,   \"because  they  had   a  reasonable  basis  for\n\nbelieving  . .  . that  the Company  no longer  desired their\n\nservices,\" citing Ridgeway Trucking Co., 243 NLRB 1048 (1979)\r                                                   \n\n(\"the  fact of  a discharge  does not  depend on  the  use of\n\nformal  words of  firing,\"  but upon  whether the  employer's\n\nwords or  actions \"would logically  lead a prudent  person to\n\nbelieve his  tenure had been terminated\").  Second, the Board\n\nfound their discharge was in retaliation for the unfair labor\n\npractice charge, which National believed they \"supported\"  or\n\n\"assisted\" Yeppes in filing.\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\n          National counters that  the evidence is clear  that\n\nQuintero,  Silva  and  the  Duque  brothers  were  discharged\n\nbecause they were late to work  on March 12, and did not show\n\nup  at 1411  Broadway on March  14, the  job to  which Ortega\n\ntestified  he had  reassigned them.   The  Board's considered\n\nassessment  of the  evidence  found it  did not  support this\n\nversion of events.  \n\n          Again, we find the Board's conclusion is based upon\n\nreasonable resolutions  of credibility issues.   There was no\n\nevidence lateness was discussed during Ortega's interrogation\n\nof the  four employees  on the  morning of  March 12,  nor is\n\nthere any solid evidence each of them was late  on that day.7\n\nThere was evidence, however,  that during this meeting Ortega\n\nwas visibly  upset by news  of the charge,  initially accused\n\nthe  four men of having filed  it, repeatedly questioned them\n\nabout it,  specifically  requested that  Jairo Duque  contact\n\nYeppes in a manner  that suggested, as the Board  found, that\n\nhe meant for Jairo  to talk Yeppes into dropping  the charge,\n\nand simultaneously informed all  four that they were  off the\n\njob.  The four denied  ever being told to report for  work at\n\n1411 Broadway on Saturday,  March 14.  Nor is  there evidence\n\nthat  the supervisor on that  project expected them.   On the\n\ncontrary, they testified that Ortega told them to try to find\r                                                                 \n\n                    \r                                \n\n7.  In  fact,  there was  testimony  that  Silva was  already\nupstairs  suiting up  for work  when he was  told to  go back\ndownstairs and wait for Ortega to arrive.\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nwork  elsewhere, at 100 Wall  Street or 1411  Broadway.  When\n\nthey  tried the former, they found no one there and concluded\n\nthey had been, in effect, discharged.\n\n          The Scope of Section 8(a)(4)\r                                                  \n\n          National  contends in  any event  that  an employer\n\ncannot  be  found in  violation of     8(a)(4) for  taking an\n\nadverse action against an  employee unless that employee has,\n\nstrictly, \"filed  charges or given testimony  under the Act.\"\n\nN.L.R.A.   8(a)(4), 29 U.S.C.   158(a)(4), and that the Board\n\nimpermissibly  broadened its  scope  by ruling  that it  also\n\nprotects supporting  or assisting another in  relation to the\n\nfiling of charges.\n\n          Section 8(a)(4) should be  read broadly in favor of\n\nthe employee,  NLRB v.

This is a petition\r                                                   \n\nby National Surface Cleaning, Inc. to review and set aside an\n\norder of the  National Labor Relations Board  finding that it\n\nunlawfully  discharged  employees  Humberto   Yeppes,  Carlos\n\nSilva,  Libardo  Quintero,  and  Jairo and  Cesar  Duque,  in\n\nviolation of  Section 8(a)(4) and  (1) of the  National Labor\n\nRelations Act, 29 U.S.C.   158(a)(4) and (1).  In re National\r                                                                         \n\nSurface Cleaning, 314 NLRB No. 92 (July 28, 1994).  The Board\r                            \n\nfound National  violated the Act by notifying Yeppes on March\n\n13,  1993  that he  would never  work  for the  company again\n\nbecause  of  having filed  an  unfair  labor practice  charge\n\nagainst  it on  March 2,  1993, and  by discharging  the four\n\nothers for assisting or  supporting him.  National's position\n\nis that (1) substantial evidence does not support the Board's\n\nfinding as  to Yeppes  because  he was  let go  prior to  its\n\nlearning of  the charge,  (2) the Board  misconstrued section\n\n8(a)(4)  in  ruling  that  it protects  the  others,  and (3)\n\nignored evidence indicating National's actions were in no way\n\nbased upon the charge.\n\n          Background\r                                \n\n          National is engaged in  asbestos removal at various\n\nsites  in and  around New York.   At  each site  it employs a\n\nproject  manager, foremen,  and  a crew  of asbestos  removal\n\nworkers,  members of  the  Mason Tenders  Union.   Typically,\n\nthese workers are hired on a  project by project basis.  They\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nmay be laid off for some time, and recalled when required.\n\n          As of  February 1992  the employees in  the present\n\ncase were all working at  1411 Broadway under project manager\n\nPablo Ortega.   On February  21, Ortega laid  off the  entire\n\ncrew,1 with  the exception of  five employees who  he brought\n\nto a new  project at the Grace building.   Some of those laid\n\noff  believed  they  were not  transferred  because  National\n\nintended to complete the Grace job with non-union workers.\n\n          On March 2, 1992, Yeppes visited the Grace building\n\nand thanked Ortega for having employed  him at 1411 Broadway,\n\nbut  Ortega did not  offer him work  at the new  site.  Later\n\nthat day, Yeppes  filed an unfair labor  practice charge with\n\nthe Board,  alleging National laid off its  employees at 1411\n\nBroadway and did not recall them to the Grace site because of\n\ntheir  union membership.  Around  March 5 Yeppes  and some of\n\nthe others also complained to the union local.  On March 6 or\n\n7,  Ortega called Quintero and asked him to contact the group\n\nwho  had been laid  off from 1411  Broadway and tell  them to\n\nreport  to work  at the  Grace building  on Monday,  March 9.\n\nQuintero  complied,  but  did  not  call  Yeppes  because  he\n\nregarded Yeppes  as a supervisor2 and  therefore not included\n\nin the group.  On March 9, all except Yeppes began working at\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  There  was some dispute as to whether Yeppes was laid off\nat this time or sometime prior to the others.\n\n2.  Yeppes had at times been employed as a project manager.\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nthe Grace site.\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          National  received Yeppes' Board complaint on March\n\n9, and  Ortega testified to hearing  about it by  March 10 or\n\n11.   However, a union  representative had visited  the Grace\n\nsite to check union cards sometime before March 9.3\n\n          On March 12, foreman  Javiar Alzate told  Quintero,\n\nSilva  and the Duque brothers upon their arrival at work that\n\nthey should not  begin and to wait for  Ortega.  According to\n\nthe employees, when Ortega arrived he accused  them of filing\n\na  complaint against him, which  they denied.   He claimed to\n\nhave seen Yeppes' name on a complaint but admitted he had not\n\nseen  the others'  names.   He then  told them  they were  no\n\nlonger needed at the Grace building but might be able to find\n\nwork at  100 Wall  Street or  1411 Broadway.   He also  asked\n\nJairo Duque to talk to Yeppes.  Ortega testified that he laid\n\nthem off because they had been  late to work on March 12 (and\n\nJairo Duque had  missed several days  that week) and  because\n\nthey  never showed up at 1411 Broadway,4 but it is undisputed\n\nthat the only subject  he discussed with them on  the morning\n\nof the 12th was the complaint.  Later that day foreman Alzate\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  The  testimony of  Jairo Duque  suggests that  Ortega was\nprompted  to recall the laid off workers after the union shop\nsteward visited the building.\n\n4.  Ortega  testified that  he called  the Duque  brothers on\nFriday  evening, March  12, and  left a  message for  them to\nreport to 1411 Broadway the next day for a weekend job.  They\nclaim they were  never told.  They did go  to 100 Wall Street\non Monday, March  16, but  found no one  there and,  assuming\nOrtega had misled them, never went to the 1411 Broadway site.\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\ntold  two other employees that  a group could  no longer work\n\nfor  National because they had put in a complaint against the\n\ncompany.    The  brother of  one  of  the  employees, also  a\n\nforeman, told him the same thing.\n\n          On March  13 Ortega called  Yeppes and said  he had\n\nfound out about the  complaint and was upset that  Yeppes had\n\ncome to thank  him and then turned around  and filed a charge\n\nagainst him.  Yeppes  testified that Ortega then told  him he\n\nwould never work for  the company again.  Ortega  denied ever\n\nsaying  this.  Yeppes in  fact has never  worked for National\n\nagain,  and the other  four, despite efforts,  have also been\n\nunable to get themselves rehired.5\n\n                            Yeppes\r                                              \n\n          Section 8(a)(4)  of the  Act makes it  unlawful \"to\n\ndischarge  or  otherwise  discriminate  against  an  employee\n\nbecause he has  filed charges or  given testimony under  this\n\nAct.\"   N.L.R.A.   8(a)(4), 29 U.S.C.   158(a)(4).  The Board\n\nfound  Ortega's decision  not to  recall Yeppes to  the Grace\n\nbuilding along with the others on March 9 did not violate the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  Quintero once  sought work  at 1411 Broadway  with a  co-\nworker, the co-worker was  hired, but Quintero was told  by a\nsupervisor that  he had  been instructed  not to  hire anyone\ninvolved in the complaint against the company.  Another time,\nhe  had been under the  impression that he  had been rehired,\nbut when he showed up he  was informed he was not among those\nrecalled because  he was involved  in the complaint.   Ortega\neventually rehired  Silva for the 1411  Broadway weekend job,\nbut  we decline  to  disturb the  Board's  finding that  this\n\"simply represents . .  . that Ortega changed his  mind about\nSilva,\" and had no effect on the March 12 events.\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nAct, but that Ortega's March 13  communication with Yeppes to\n\nthe  effect  that he  would  never  work  for National  again\n\nbecause he had filed charges  against Ortega and the company,\n\ndid.  The question here is not whether   8(a)(4) applies, but\n\nwhether Yeppes was effectively discharged on March 13 because\n\nof the  charge, or for  unrelated reasons  sometime prior  to\n\nNational's (or Ortega's) awareness of the charge, as National\n\ncontends.\n\n          National  claims  the  evidence   establishes  that\n\nOrtega  never intended to recall Yeppes after he was laid off\n\nsometime  in February because he felt he could no longer work\n\nwith  Yeppes6 and  never  intended to  hire  him again.    It\n\ninsists that Yeppes had therefore been discharged well before\n\nit  became  aware  of   his  unfair  labor  practice  charge.\n\nNational points to the fact that on March 2 Yeppes sought out\n\nOrtega  and thanked  him for  having given  him work,  and to\n\nOrtega's testimony  that he was dissatisfied  with Yeppes and\n\nthat  it  was his  practice simply  to  never recall  such an\n\nemployee, rather than  to inform him  that he is  permanently\n\ndischarged, and  that all  of this conclusively  supports the\n\ninference that Yeppes had  been discharged effective prior to\n\nhis  ever having filed the charge.  It furthermore claims the\n\n                    \r                                \n\n6.  National  claims  Yeppes  had  repeated  difficulty  with\nOrtega, in large part because he had once been employed  as a\nsupervisor and  the younger  and less experienced  Ortega had\nworked under him.\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nBoard had no basis  for crediting Yeppes' testimony regarding\n\nOrtega's March 13 threat that Yeppes would never work for the\n\ncompany again when Ortega denied ever making it.\n\n          We are satisfied that the Board reasonably resolved\n\nthese credibility issues against National, and its conclusion\n\nthat the March 13  conversation transformed Yeppes' temporary\n\nlay off into permanent  discharge is supported by substantial\n\nevidence.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1951).  The  Board found no evidence\n\nYeppes had  been permanently  discharged simply by  virtue of\n\nthe fact  that he was not  recalled along with the  others on\n\nMarch  9.   Further,  simply  because  Ortega had  difficulty\n\nworking  with Yeppes  does  not mean  other National  project\n\nmanagers  did  or would,  so  even  if Ortega  himself  never\n\nintended  to recall  Yeppes this  does not  mean he  had been\n\ndischarged  by   National.     Yeppes   had  completed   jobs\n\nsatisfactorily for other National supervisors, and had been a\n\nproject  manager himself prior to working for Ortega.  And if\n\nYeppes  had already  been permanently  discharged,  why would\n\nOrtega  need to tell him  on March 13,  while castigating him\n\nfor filing charges against him and the company, that he would\n\nnever  work  for  the  company  again,  as  the  Board found.\n\nFinally, there  was evidence that other  supervisors had been\n\ntold not to use  any of the employees associated  with filing\n\nthe  charge,  providing the  Board  with  reason to  conclude\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nOrtega's threat was neither fictional nor \n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nidle, and was  prompted by and  delivered in retaliation  for\n\nYeppes' having exercised his rights under the Act.\n\n                   The Four Other Employees\r                                                       \n\n          As to the other  four employees, the questions are,\n\nfirst, whether  they were discharged; second,  if so, whether\n\nthis was for being late  to work and not showing up  at a job\n\nto  which they  had  allegedly been  reassigned, as  National\n\ncontends, or because National believed  they had participated\n\nin  filing charges  under the  Act, as  the Board  found; and\n\nthird,  whether      8(a)(4)  prohibits   an  employer   from\n\ndischarging  or otherwise discriminating  against an employee\n\nfor believing  that he  \"supported\" or \"assisted\"  another in\n\nrelation to filing such charges against it.\n\n          Reasons for the Discharge\r                                               \n\n          The  Board  concluded   that  the  four  had   been\n\ndischarged,   \"because  they  had   a  reasonable  basis  for\n\nbelieving  . .  . that  the Company  no longer  desired their\n\nservices,\" citing Ridgeway Trucking Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(1979)\r                                                   \n\n(\"the  fact of  a discharge  does not  depend on  the  use of\n\nformal  words of  firing,\"  but upon  whether the  employer's\n\nwords or  actions \"would logically  lead a prudent  person to\n\nbelieve his  tenure had been terminated\").  Second, the Board\n\nfound their discharge was in retaliation for the unfair labor\n\npractice charge, which National believed they \"supported\"  or\n\n\"assisted\" Yeppes in filing.\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\n          National counters that  the evidence is clear  that\n\nQuintero,  Silva  and  the  Duque  brothers  were  discharged\n\nbecause they were late to work  on March 12, and did not show\n\nup  at 1411  Broadway on March  14, the  job to  which Ortega\n\ntestified  he had  reassigned them.   The  Board's considered\n\nassessment  of the  evidence  found it  did not  support this\n\nversion of events.  \n\n          Again, we find the Board's conclusion is based upon\n\nreasonable resolutions  of credibility issues.   There was no\n\nevidence lateness was discussed during Ortega's interrogation\n\nof the  four employees  on the  morning of  March 12,  nor is\n\nthere any solid evidence each of them was late  on that day.7\n\nThere was evidence, however,  that during this meeting Ortega\n\nwas visibly  upset by news  of the charge,  initially accused\n\nthe  four men of having filed  it, repeatedly questioned them\n\nabout it,  specifically  requested that  Jairo Duque  contact\n\nYeppes in a manner  that suggested, as the Board  found, that\n\nhe meant for Jairo  to talk Yeppes into dropping  the charge,\n\nand simultaneously informed all  four that they were  off the\n\njob.  The four denied  ever being told to report for  work at\n\n1411 Broadway on Saturday,  March 14.  Nor is  there evidence\n\nthat  the supervisor on that  project expected them.   On the\n\ncontrary, they testified that Ortega told them to try to find\r                                                                 \n\n                    \r                                \n\n7.  In  fact,  there was  testimony  that  Silva was  already\nupstairs  suiting up  for work  when he was  told to  go back\ndownstairs and wait for Ortega to arrive.\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nwork  elsewhere, at 100 Wall  Street or 1411  Broadway.
