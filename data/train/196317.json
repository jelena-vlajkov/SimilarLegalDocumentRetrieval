On May 4,  1994, appellant Jose Ortiz-Perez\r                           \r\n\nwas  indicted on one  count of reentering  the United States,\r\n\nafter   having  been   deported,   without  having   obtained\r\n\npermission to reenter from the Attorney General, in violation\r\n\nof 8 U.S.C.   1326.  On June 6, 1994, he moved to dismiss the\r\n\nindictment.  While Ortiz-Perez  concedes that his reentry was\r\n\nillegal, he claims that  the government misled him concerning\r\n\nhis  right to reenter  and therefore should  be estopped from\r\n\nprosecuting him  for his illegal  reentry.  After  the motion\r\n\nwas  denied, Ortiz-Perez  entered  an unconditional  plea  of\r\n\nguilty.  He  now appeals the denial by the  district court of\r\n\nhis motion to dismiss.\r\n\n     This court has held  \"with monotonous regularity that an\r\n\nunconditional guilty plea effectuates a waiver of any and all\r\n\nindependent  non-jurisdictional lapses  that may  have marred\r\n\nthe  case's progress up to  that point, thereby absolving any\r\n\nerrors in  the trial  court's antecedent rulings  (other than\r\n\nerrors that  implicate the  court's  jurisdiction).\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

A claim of estoppel is  an affirmative\r\n\ndefense, not a  challenge to the court's  jurisdiction.  Fed.\r\n\nR.  Civ. P.  8(c).  Therefore,  by entering  an unconditional\r\r\n\nplea of guilty,  Ortiz-Perez has waived  any right to  appeal\r\n\nthedistrictcourt'sdenial ofhismotiontodismiss theindictment.1\r\n\n     The  government's  motion   for  summary  affirmance  is\r\n\ngranted.
