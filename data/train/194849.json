Plaintiffs Vilma E. Rivera and Victor\n                     \n\nOtero  challenge  the  district  court's  decision  to  grant\n\ndefendant Corporacion Insular  de Seguros's (\"CIS's\")  motion\n\nfor judgment as a  matter of law, see Fed. R. Civ.  P. 50, on\n                                     \n\nplaintiffs'  negligence claim.    Finding  no  error  in  the\n\ndecision below, we affirm.\n\n          We  summarize only the  relevant facts.   This is a\n\nmedical malpractice  case which plaintiffs brought  on behalf\n\nof their daughter  Vivian, who was injured  during childbirth\n\nas  a result  of a  doctor's  alleged negligence.   In  their\n\noriginal complaint, plaintiffs sued the doctor involved, CIS,\n\nthe  hospital's  insurance   carrier,  and  several   unnamed\n\ninsurance  companies.    Before  trial,  however,  plaintiffs\n\nsettled with  the doctor.   Subsequently,  plaintiffs amended\n\ntheir  complaint to  state a  direct action  against  CIS for\n\nnegligence, and the case then proceeded to trial against CIS.\n\nAt the  close of the  evidence, CIS moved  for judgment  as a\n\nmatter of law,  arguing that plaintiffs'  claim had not  been\n\nfiled within the time specified in the policy.  Finding merit\n\nin  that argument,  the district  court  granted the  motion.\n\nThis appeal followed. \n\n          Plaintiffs' central contention is  that CIS, by not\n\nspecifically pleading it, waived the affirmative defense upon\n\nwhich the district court relied  to grant the Rule 50 motion.\n\nWe do not agree.   In its answer, CIS included the  following\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nstatement  under  the   heading  of  \"Affirmative  Defenses\":\n\n\"[W]hatever  policy may ha[ve] been issued to [the hospital],\n\nif any, would be limited to its terms, clauses and conditions\n\nand by its limit of  coverage.\"  Plaintiffs were therefore on\n\nnotice that CIS would defend on the basis of the terms of the\n\npolicy,  and, having had the  policy in their possession well\n\nbefore the  trial  date, can  hardly claim  surprise at  CIS'\n\nreliance upon  its express terms  as support for its  Rule 50\n\nmotion.  Cf.  Mitchell v. Jefferson County Bd.  of Educ., 936\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  539,  544  (11th Cir.  1991)  (\"Liberal  pleading rules\n\nrequire a court  to determine whether a  plaintiff has notice\n\nthat a defendant is relying on an unpled affirmative  defense\n\nand whether the plaintiff can legitimately claim surprise and\n\nprejudice   from    a   failure   to   plead    the   defense\n\naffirmatively.\").    See   also  Valle  v.  Heirs   of  Julio\n                                                             \n\nWiscovitch &amp; The Globe Indemnity Co., 88 P.R.R. 84, 88 (1963)\n                                    \n\n(\"The purpose  of the rule [that affirmative defenses must be\n\npleaded] is to  avoid surprises.\"); 5  Charles Alan Wright  &amp;\n\nArthur  R.  Miller,  Federal Practice  and  Procedure    1274\n                                                     \n\n(1990) (\"An  affirmative defense  may be  pleaded in  general\n\nterms  and will  be  held  to  be sufficient,  and  therefore\n\ninvulnerable  to a  motion to  strike,  as long  as it  gives\n\nplaintiff  fair  notice  of the  nature  of  the defense.\").1\n\n                    \n\n1.  Plaintiffs rely upon  Valle, 88 P.R.R. at 88-89, to argue\n                               \nthat CIS waived its defense under  Puerto Rico law.  In  that\ncase, the court held that an allegation in an answer that the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nAccordingly, we  agree with  the district  court's conclusion\n\nthat CIS did  not waive  the defense upon  which its Rule  50\n\nmotion was based.  \n\n          Moreover,  having  carefully  reviewed  plaintiffs'\n\nremaining  arguments, we  find  each of  them  to be  without\n\nmerit.    We   further  find  that  the  appeal  presents  no\n\nsubstantial  question,  and  we  therefore  deny  plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for  oral argument  and summarily  affirm pursuant  to\n\nLocal Rule 27.1.\n\n                    \n\ninsurance   \"policy   `was  subject   to   the   clauses  and\nrestrictions appearing therein,'\" was  not sufficient to  put\nthe plaintiff  on notice  that the  insurer would  assert the\ninsured's \"lack of  cooperation\" as a defense at  trial.  Id.\n                                                             \nat 89.  The court  reasoned that, based on the aforementioned\nclause, the  insured  would have  no  way of  discerning  the\nspecific defense the  insurer intended to use at  trial.  Id.\n                                                             \nat 88-89.  \n      The  instant case  does not,  however,  raise the  same\nnotice concerns.   CIS stated as an  affirmative defense that\nits  liability was  limited by the  terms of the  policy.  At\ntrial, CIS  argued simply that  a claim was not  filed within\nthe  date specified  in the  policy.   As plaintiffs  had the\npolicy well before trial, they cannot claim lack of notice of\nthat defense.   In our view, therefore,  plaintiffs' reliance\nupon Valle is unavailing.  In any event, the requirements for\n          \npleading affirmative defenses are procedural and,  therefore,\ndepend on federal law, not Commonwealth law.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n",
