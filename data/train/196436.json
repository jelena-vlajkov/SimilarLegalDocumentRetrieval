This is an  appeal by William\r                    KEETON, District Judge\r                                          \r\n\nE. Donoghue (\"Donoghue\"), Plaintiff-Appellant, from a Preliminary\r\n\nInjunction of limited  scope.  Donoghue asserts that the district\r\n\ncourt erred in its  interpretation of contract documents executed\r\n\nby the parties and asks this court to expand relief to, or nearer\r\n\nto, the  full scope  he  requested in  the  district court.    We\r\n\nconclude that if the  district court committed any error  of law,\r\n\nthe error was  harmless in relation  to the issues  before us  in\r\n\nthis appeal.  Also, we conclude  that the district court did  not\r\n\nabuse  its discretion  in  fashioning the  limited  scope of  the\r\n\nPreliminary Injunction entered.  We therefore affirm the district\r\n\ncourt's order.\r\n\n          To avoid uncertainty that  might otherwise exist  about\r\n\nthe  effect of the district court's order (and our affirmance) on\r\n\nfurther proceedings in this  case, we explicitly state  the bases\r\n\nof  our affirmance and explicitly note certain conclusions of the\r\n\ndistrict  court upon  which we  do not  rely.   These conclusions\r                                                \r\n\nrelate  to  issues that  are  at  least potentially  mixed-legal-\r\n\nfactual issues that would be  more appropriately decided, both in\r\n\nthe district court  and on appeal, after  the parties have  had a\r\n\nfull  opportunity  for  discovery  and  development  of  evidence\r\n\nbearing upon the factual elements of the legal-factual mix.  They\r\n\nare  open to de novo  consideration in the  district court during\r                              \r\n\nfurther proceedings there, as well as on appeal.\r\n\n                               -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n                       I.

Before July 1989\r\n\n          Donoghue  is  an investment  adviser  well-known  as an\r\n\nexpert on money  markets and mutual  funds.  Acting  individually\r\n\nand through  a  number of  corporate  entities, he  has  marketed\r\n\nadvice for more than twenty years in books, newsletters, columns,\r\n\non-line services, and  public appearances.   One of his  business\r\n\nentities  was The  Donoghue Organization,  Inc., a  Massachusetts\r\n\ncorporation  of which  Donoghue was  the sole  stockholder.   Its\r\n\nflagship publication was  Donoghue's MoneyLetter--a  semi-monthly\r                                                          \r\n\nnewsletter introduced by  Donoghue in 1980.   In 1986, Donoghue's\r                                                                           \r\n\nMoneyLetter was voted \"Best Financial Advisory Newsletter\" by the\r                     \r\n\nNewsletter Association.\r\n\nB.  Documents Dated July 28, 1989\r          B.  Documents Dated July 28, 1989\r\n\n          Simultaneously,  two documents  were executed.   Though\r\n\nsigned by Donoghue  in September 1989, these agreements were made\r\n\n\"as  of\"  July 28, 1989.   They  were  called the  Stock Purchase\r\n\nAgreement (\"SPA\")  and the Personal Services  and Non-Competition\r\n\nAgreement (\"PSA\").\r\n\n          The Stock Purchase Agreement  was signed by Donoghue as\r\n\nsole shareholder of The Donoghue  Organization, Inc. and Mary Ann\r\n\nBonomo as Vice  President of IBC  USA (Publications), Inc.  (\"IBC\r\n\nUSA\").  Under the  terms of the SPA, Defendant-Appellant  IBC USA\r\n\npurchased  all 10,000  shares  of Common  Stock  of The  Donoghue\r\n\nOrganization, Inc. from Donoghue for $2,000,000.\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          The Personal Services and Non-Competition Agreement was\r\n\nalso signed  by Donoghue and Mary Ann Bonomo.  Under the terms of\r\n\nthe  PSA,  Donoghue  became  a  part-time  employee  of IBC  USA,\r\n\nagreeing  to devote approximately  one-third of  his professional\r\n\ntime  to  editorial,  promotional,  and  other  activities mainly\r\n\ninvolving the MoneyLetter publication.   The initial term of  the\r                                   \r\n\nPSA was set at five years, with one five-year extension available\r\n\nat the option of IBC USA.\r\n\n          A central subject of dispute  in this litigation is the\r\n\nscope and extent of the right of IBC USA and its new wholly owned\r\n\nsubsidiary, IBC/Donoghue, Inc., also a Defendant-Appellee, to use\r\n\nDonoghue's  name.   The  contractual  rights  of the  Defendants-\r\n\nAppellees are controlled by the SPA and the PSA.\r\n\n          A provision of the SPA declares:\r\n\n            The rights  to use  the name  \"William E.\r\n            Donoghue\"  and  variations  thereof  have\r\n            always  been the  property of  the Seller\r\n            [Donoghue], not the Company [The Donoghue\r\n            Organization,  Inc.],  and  Buyer's  [IBC\r\n            USA's] rights to the use of such name are\r\n            governed   by   the   Personal   Services\r\n            Agreement.\r\n\nSPA cl. 3(m).\r\n\n          The  PSA  elaborates  on the  rights  to  use the  name\r\n\n\"William E. Donoghue\" stated above in  the SPA.  The relevant PSA\r\n\nprovision appeared  as one  long paragraph, reproduced  here with\r\n\nbracketed  insertions and  spacing that we  have inserted  to aid\r\n\nreading.\r\n\n            Use of Employee's Name.

Developments Before Amendment of the PSA on July 21, 1994\r          C.  Developments Before Amendment of the PSA on July 21, 1994\r\n\n          Notwithstanding the currently  alleged deficiencies  in\r\n\nthe  clarity  and specificity  of  the SPA  and  PSA, and  in the\r\n\nperformance of each party under these agreements, the first five-\r\n\nyear term of the PSA passed relatively uneventfully.  During this\r\n\nterm,  IBC  USA  changed  the  corporate  name  of  The  Donoghue\r\n\nOrganization,  Inc. to  IBC/Donoghue, Inc.;  Donoghue contributed\r\n\narticles  to Donoghue's MoneyLetter  and performed  various other\r                                             \r\n\nduties under terms of the PSA.\r\n\n                               -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          According  to clause  2(b)  of  the  PSA, IBC  USA  was\r\n\nrequired to give notice  to Donoghue one year before the last day\r\n\nof  the term of the PSA if IBC  USA wished to exercise its option\r\n\nto extend the term of  the PSA for an additional five  years.  In\r\n\nearly July of  1993, before  the one-year benchmark  of July  28,\r\n\n1993, IBC  USA initiated discussions with  Donoghue regarding the\r\n\npossibility  of  amending the  PSA  before extending  it  for the\r\n\nadditional five-year term.\r\n\n          IBC  USA  proposed   to  restructure  the  compensation\r\n\nprovisions of the PSA, primarily to eliminate the 5% royalty that\r\n\nwould have first begun  to accrue when the second  five-year term\r\n\ncommenced.   In  return,  IBC USA  proposed  to increase  various\r\n\nincentive payments to  Donoghue, based on the number of telephone\r\n\ninquiries generated by his columns, appearances, and  books.  The\r\n\nrecord  is  unclear  about  how this  proposal,  or  negotiations\r\n\nrelating to it, proceeded or whether any progress was made toward\r\n\namending the PSA.\r\n\n          In any event,  on July  16, 1993, IBC  USA gave  formal\r\n\nnotice  to Donoghue of its  desire to exercise  its options under\r\n\nclauses 2(b)  and 11 of the PSA to extend, for an additional five\r\n\nyears,  to July 29, 1999,  the term of  (1) Donoghue's employment\r\n\nand (2) the license to use his name.\r\n\nD.   Amendment of the  PSA on  July 21, 1994  and the Failure  of\r          D.   Amendment of the  PSA on  July 21, 1994  and the Failure  of\r\n     Negotiations\r               Negotiations\r\n\n          Negotiations   regarding  an   amendment  of   the  PSA\r\n\ncontinued as the first five-year term was coming to a  close.  On\r\n\n                               -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nJuly 21, 1994, just before the end of the initial five-year  term\r\n\nof the PSA, the parties executed a modification of the agreement.\r\n\nThis modification extended for one month the time period in which\r\n\nIBC USA could use Donoghue's name without paying the 5% royalty:\r\n\n          IBC/USA will  continue to have  the right  to\r\n          use   the  name   William  E.   Donoghue  and\r\n          variations thereof  on or in  connection with\r\n          the  existing  products  of  IBC/USA  without\r\n          payment of the stated 5% royalty until August\r\n          31, 1994.\r\n\nApp.  at 00062.   In return for this  concession, IBC USA allowed\r\n\nDonoghue  to send his  employees to  IBC USA's  weekly Donoghue's\r                                                                           \r\n\nMoneyLetter  Investment Committee  meetings during  the  month of\r                     \r\n\nAugust, 1994.\r\n\n          This interim  provision delaying  the time when  the 5%\r\n\nroyalty payments would begin to  accrue was itself modified, with\r\n\nDonoghue's consent.   The  commencing date when  royalty payments\r\n\nwould  begin  was  moved  to  October  31,  1994.    Negotiations\r\n\nregarding  a  permanent  amendment  to  the  PSA,  however,  were\r\n\nunsuccessful.  The  parties never agreed to any further amendment\r\n\nof the PSA.\r\n\n          As the  final interim  extension was  about  to end  in\r\n\nOctober,  1994,  Defendants-Appellees removed  Donoghue's surname\r\n\nfrom   Donoghue's  MoneyLetter,  making   the  new  title  simply\r                                        \r\n\nMoneyLetter.    The name  of  the  corporate subsidiary  remained\r                     \r\n\nIBC/Donoghue, Inc., however, and MoneyLetter continued to contain\r                                                      \r\n\nreferences  to Donoghue  and  his name  within  the text  of  the\r\n\nnewsletter.   For  example,  one section  of  the newsletter  was\r\n\ndevoted to the \"Donoghue Signal,\" a statistical measure of market\r\n\n                               -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nperformance.   Also, MoneyLetter  was  labeled as  \"a service  of\r                                          \r\n\nIBC/Donoghue, Inc.\" on the  bottom of the first page.  William E.\r\n\nDonoghue was  listed in the  masthead as \"Founder  &amp; Contributing\r\n\nEditor\" of MoneyLetter.\r                                \r\n\n          Defendants-Appellees  now  no  longer publish  anything\r\n\nwith the name \"William E. Donoghue\" appearing in the  name of the\r\n\npublication,  but  they  do  market  publications  in  which  the\r\n\ncorporate name IBC/Donoghue  is used within the title.

Other Developments\r          E.  Other Developments\r\n\n          The precipitating  event for the current  civil action,\r\n\nhowever,  was not the use of Donoghue's  name in the name or text\r\n\nof any newsletter or  the nonpayment of royalties but  rather the\r\n\nuse  of Donoghue's  name  and likeness  in promotional  materials\r\n\nadvertising MoneyLetter.\r                                 \r\n\n          In  December   1994,  IBC   USA  sent  a   direct  mail\r\n\nadvertisement for MoneyLetter to the general investing public and\r                                       \r\n\nthe  professional investment  community.   The envelope  in which\r\n\nthis  mailing   was  sent  featured  a   photograph  of  Donoghue\r\n\npurportedly gesturing at advertisements of five large mutual fund\r\n\ncompanies.   Above the photograph  was a statement  in large type\r\n\nand in quotation marks:  \"I'm sick and tired of investors getting\r\n\n                               -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nripped-off  by ads like these!\"  There were similar statements in\r\n\nsmaller type below the photograph and on the back of the envelope\r\n\nas well.  The district court found that Donoghue had neither made\r\n\nnor authorized any of  the statements on the envelope.

Inside  the envelope was  a letter, purportedly\r                         \r\n\nsigned by Donoghue, that further criticized the advertisements of\r\n\nsuch mutual  fund companies as Value  Line, Fidelity Investments,\r\n\nDreyfus  Corporation,  Berger  Associates,  Inc.,   and  Scudder,\r\n\nStevens &amp; Clark, Inc.  The district court found that Donoghue had\r\n\nnot authorized this letter.

Moreover,\r\n\nValue Line  threatened litigation against Donoghue  and has since\r\n\nfiled an action in federal court for the Southern District of New\r\n\nYork  against IBC USA and IBC/Donoghue, Inc. claiming that it has\r\n\nbeen  injured   by  the  \"explicitly  false,\"   \"deceptive,\"  and\r\n\n\"misleading\"  statements in  the direct  mail campaign.

The  columnist observed  that  use of  such \"back-tested\"\r\n\nresults  was inconsistent  with the  published views  of Donoghue\r\n\nhimself.\r\n\n          Approximately  two weeks after  the publication  of the\r\n\nForbes  piece, on  May  8, 1995,  Donoghue  commenced this  civil\r                \r\n\naction, claiming infringement  of the trademark in his name under\r\n\nthe Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.    1125 (Count I); improper use of  his\r\n\nname and photograph in  violation of Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 214,   3A\r\n\n(Count II);  trademark infringement  under the common  law (Count\r\n\nIII);  breach  of  contract,  including  the  obligation  to  pay\r\n\nroyalties  (Count IV);  and violation  of Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 93A\r\n\n(Count V).\r\n\n                 II.  The District Court Decision\r                           II.  The District Court Decision\r\n         of Donoghue's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\r                   of Donoghue's Motion for Preliminary Injunction\r\n\n          Based  upon counts I and  II, Donoghue filed  on May 8,\r\n\n1995,  along  with  his  complaint,  a  motion  for  a  temporary\r\n\nrestraining order  and a preliminary injunction.   Donoghue asked\r\n\nthe court  to enjoin  the Defendants-Appellees  from distributing\r\n\nany newsletter, publication or promotional materials:\r\n\n                               -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          upon which  the name  William E.  Donoghue or\r\n          any  variation  thereof  (including  but  not\r\n          limited to \"Donoghue,\" the \"Donoghue Signal,\"\r\n          \"IBC/Donoghue\"   or   \"IBC/Donoghue,   Inc.\")\r\n          appears,  or   upon  which  any   picture  of\r\n          plaintiff William E. Donoghue appears . . . .\r\n\nApp. at 00073.   The only ways in which  the Defendants-Appellees\r\n\nwould  have been able to use Donoghue's name under this requested\r\n\ninjunction would have been  as a by-line for an  article actually\r\n\nwritten  by Donoghue or in  the masthead of  MoneyLetter with the\r                                                                  \r\n\ntitle \"Founder &amp; Contributing Editor.\"\r\n\n          After  a hearing  on May 10,  1995, the  district court\r\n\nentered a  temporary restraining  order of  a more  limited scope\r\n\nthan  Donoghue had  requested.   On May  26, 1995,  after further\r\n\nbriefing by  the parties,  the district court  granted Donoghue's\r\n\nmotion for a preliminary  injunction.  The Preliminary Injunction\r\n\nfashioned  by the  district  court, however,  like the  Temporary\r\n\nRestraining Order that preceded it, was significantly narrower in\r\n\nscope than Donoghue had requested.\r\n\n          Instead of granting a blanket prohibition on the use of\r\n\nDonoghue's  name,  the  district  court focused  on  the  alleged\r\n\nharmful activity of  the Defendants-Appellees.  As  a result, the\r\n\ncourt required only that the Defendants-Appellees:\r\n\n          1.  refrain from distributing to any customer\r\n          or  potential  customer  or anyone  else  any\r\n          advertising or promotional  materials or  any\r\n          other material in  which William E.  Donoghue\r\n          is  represented  as criticizing  or otherwise\r\n          commenting  on any specific  person or entity\r\n          and  any  other  material   which  represents\r\n          William E.  Donoghue as stating  things which\r\n          are inconsistent with his views as stated  in\r\n          his previously published material;\r\n\n                               -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          2.  refrain from distributing to any customer\r\n          or potential customer or anyone else material\r\n          which   contains    William   E.   Donoghue's\r\n          photograph, portrait or likeness, without the\r\n          plaintiff's express prior written consent;\r\n\n          3.  refrain from distributing to any customer\r\n          or  potential  customer  or anyone  else  any\r\n          material  in  which  the  name   \"William  E.\r\n          Donoghue\" or any variation thereof appears in\r\n          the  title   of  the  material,   unless  the\r\n          defendants   pay   the  plaintiff   royalties\r\n          pursuant to [clause] 11 of the Personal Sales\r\n          [sic] Agreement.\r\n\nDonoghue v. IBC/USA  (Publications), Inc., 886  F. Supp. at  955.\r                                                   \r\n\nIn fashioning  this Preliminary  Injunction,  the district  court\r\n\nproperly considered  (1) the likelihood of  Donoghue's success on\r\n\nthe merits; (2) whether  Donoghue would suffer irreparable injury\r\n\nif the injunction were not granted; (3) the injury to Defendants-\r\n\nAppellees  from  granting the  injunction;  and  (4) whether  the\r\n\npublic interest  would be  adversely affected by  the injunction.\r\n\nSee Keds Corp.  v.

Some of the supporting\r\n\nfindings  and conclusions  of the  district court in  arriving at\r\n\nthis order, however,  were possibly erroneous  and, in our  view,\r\n\nthey were prematurely decided, as explained below.\r\n\n               III.  Contract Interpretation Issues\r                         III.  Contract Interpretation Issues\r\n\nA.  Introduction\r          A.  Introduction\r\n\n          When  a court  looks  to the  words  of a  document  to\r\n\nconsider  the  meaning  of those  words  in  the  context of  the\r\n\n                               -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nagreement, the search is for manifested meaning, not a  privately\r\n\nheld belief or  intent of  one party, not  communicated to  other\r\n\nparties  to the  bargain.   See  Rose-Derry  Corp. v.  Procter  &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nSchwartz, Inc., 193 N.E.  50, 52 (Mass. 1934).   Moreover, if the\r                        \r\n\nparties execute two or more  documents, with a manifested  intent\r\n\nthat  the documents  together express  their entire  agreement, a\r\n\ncourt reads  the documents together, rather  than construing each\r\n\nas if it  stood alone.  FDIC v. Singh, 977  F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1992).\r\n\n          In this  case, the  initial agreement was  expressed in\r\n\nthe two documents dated July  28, 1989.  By their own  terms they\r\n\nmanifest an  understanding that together  they completely express\r\n\none  integrated  agreement.   For example,  clause  2 of  the SPA\r\n\nreads:\r\n\n          Other  Agreements.   Simultaneously  with the\r                                     \r\n          Closing Seller  and Buyer shall  enter into a\r\n          Personal    Services    and   Non-Competition\r\n          Agreement substantially in the  form attached\r\n          as   Exhibit   2   (the  \"Personal   Services\r\n          Agreement\").\r\n\nApp. at 00026.  Also, as previously noted, clause 3(m) of the SPA\r\n\nexplicitly states  that the  rights to  use  Donoghue's name  are\r\n\ngoverned  by the  PSA.   Accordingly, we  read the  two documents\r\n\ntogether, as we  understand the  district court to  have done  as\r\n\nwell,  when  searching for  manifested  meaning  relevant to  any\r\n\nexisting dispute between the parties.\r\n\nB.  The District Court's Interpretation of the Royalty Provisions\r          B.  The District Court's Interpretation of the Royalty Provisions\r\n\n                               -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          The  statements of  the district  court explaining  its\r\n\norder  for entry  of the  Preliminary Injunction  are subject  to\r\n\nbeing interpreted as  including several distinct and  potentially\r\n\nsignificant  rulings as a matter of law,  all made as part of the\r\n\ncourt's reasoned decision to  grant the Preliminary Injunction in\r\n\nthe precise terms fashioned.\r\n\n          We  discuss  these  rulings   separately  as  well   as\r\n\ntogether.   We have chosen the order in which we discuss them for\r\n\nconvenience only; we explicitly  do not imply that this  order of\r\n\nconsideration  is compelled  by precedent or  logic.   Indeed, we\r\n\nconclude that the  several rulings are interrelated  in ways that\r\n\nmake it appropriate for  a court to  consider all of them  before\r\n\ndeciding any.   Our separation of  the district court's  combined\r\n\ndetermination into four parts and our designation  of those parts\r\n\nas \"First  Ruling,\" \"Second Ruling,\" \"Third  Ruling,\" and \"Fourth\r\n\nRuling\" are our formulations made only to facilitate reference.\r\n\n          Moreover, the  phrasing of these four  rulings is ours,\r\n\nnot  that of  the litigants.   We  have  chosen this  phrasing to\r\n\nexpress what we understand  to be the substantive content  of the\r                                                                   \r\n\ndeterminations  of  the district  court,  explicit and  implicit.\r\n\nEach  of the parties to this appeal has chosen somewhat different\r\n\nphrasings, which we find  to be ambiguous.  Examples  include the\r\n\ncontrasting statements of the  parties about whether the district\r\n\ncourt  ruled that a use of Donoghue's  name was:  (1) permissible\r\n\nwithout  regard  to whether  the use  would  result in  a royalty\r\n\nobligation, or  (2) permissible only on  condition that royalties\r\n\n                               -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nbe  paid,  or (3)  permissible only  on  condition that  the user\r\n\nexplicitly  acknowledge a  royalty obligation  (without, however,\r\n\nstating the precise conditions that would determine the  fact and\r\n\nthe amount of the royalty obligation).\r\n\n          We  have chosen this  course of stating  our reading of\r\n\nthe meaning of the district court's rulings, including reasonable\r\n\ninferences  about   implicit  assumptions  as  well  as  explicit\r\n\ndeclarations,  because the  scope of  this court's  authority and\r\n\nresponsibility is not  limited to  choosing one or  the other  of\r\n\npartisan  descriptions of  the  district court's  reasoning.   We\r\n\nexamine   that  reasoning  from   the  perspective  of  impartial\r\n\nappellate review, and not through partisan lenses.\r\n\n          First  Ruling.    The  district court  ruled  that  the\r                    First  Ruling.\r\n\nagreement of  the parties was unambiguous--not  only with respect\r\n\nto  the scope and extent of the rights of Defendants-Appellees to\r\n\nuse the name of William E. Donoghue but also with  respect to the\r\n\namount of royalties they would have to pay as a result.\r\n\n          Second  Ruling.   The  district  court  ruled that  the\r                    Second  Ruling.\r\n\nagreement unambiguously meant that Defendants-Appellees were free\r\n\nto remove Donoghue's name from the name of a product and continue\r\n\nto  use Donoghue's  name within  the text  of the product  and in\r\n\nmaterials marketing the product.\r\n\n          Third  Ruling.    The  district court  ruled  that  the\r                    Third  Ruling.\r\n\nagreement unambiguously meant that, when  exercising their rights\r\n\nunder the  Second  Ruling, Defendants-Appellees  would  incur  no\r\n\nobligation to pay any royalties during the second five-year term.\r\n\n                               -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          Fourth  Ruling.

The plain language of this\r\n          provision does  not  require the  payment  of\r\n          royalties for use of  the plaintiff's name in\r\n          connection with the defendants'  products, as\r\n          long as the plaintiff's  name does not appear\r\n          in   \"the  name\"   of  the  products.     The\r\n          plaintiff's   argument   that   it  was   his\r\n          understanding   that   he  was   entitled  to\r\n          royalties for  all uses of his  name does not\r\n          alter the plain meaning  of [clause] 11.  \"As\r\n          a  general  principle,   a  court   considers\r\n          extrinsic  evidence  to  discern intent  only\r\n          when   a   contract   term   is   ambiguous.\"\r\n          Massachusetts  Mun.

In the next paragraph of its Memorandum,\r\n\nhowever,  the district  court  rejected the  contention that  the\r\n\n                               -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nJuly 21, 1994 amendment was inconsistent with the court's reading\r\n\nof the agreement.\r\n\n            The plaintiff  claims that [clause]  11 was\r\n          changed  by  an  amendment  to  the  Personal\r\n          Services  Agreement,  dated  July  21,  1994.\r\n          That amendment allowed  IBC/USA to  \"continue\r\n          to have the right to use the  name William E.\r\n          Donoghue  and variations  thereof  on  or  in\r\n          connection  with  the  existing  products  of\r\n          IBC/USA  without  payment  of  the  stated 5%\r\n          royalty   until  August   31,  1994.\"     The\r\n          plaintiff claims that this  amendment implies\r\n          that the  5% royalty was required  to be paid\r\n          on use  of the  plaintiff's name even  if the\r\n          name  did  not appear  in  the  title of  the\r\n          defendants' publications.   Otherwise, argues\r\n          the  plaintiff,  there  would  have  been  no\r\n          reason to  include the phrase  \"in connection\r\n          with the existing products.\"  The  court does\r\n          not agree with the plaintiff's analysis.  The\r\n          language of the amendment tracks the language\r\n          of  [clause] 11,  which permitted  IBC/USA to\r\n          \"use  the  name   William  E.  Donoghue   and\r\n          variations thereof  on or in  connection with\r\n          any  and  all  of the  existing  products and\r\n          services  of  IBC/USA.\"     The   amendment's\r\n          addition, \"without  payment of the  stated 5%\r                                                                 \r\n          royalty\"  clearly  refers   to  the   royalty\r                           \r\n          provision of [clause] 11.  Rather than change\r\n          the circumstances giving rise to the right to\r\n          receive a royalty, the amendment only forgave\r\n          the   payment   of   royalties  which   would\r\n          otherwise have  been due under  paragraph 11,\r\n          i.e.,  royalties  flowing  from  the  sale of\r                        \r\n          products  in  which   the  plaintiff's   name\r\n          appears in the name.

This \"unless\" clause  implies that\r                                     \r\n\nthe district court  made what  we have designated  as its  Fourth\r\n\nRuling--Defendants-Appellees were authorized by the  agreement to\r\n\nuse Donoghue's  name in the  corporate title of  the wholly-owned\r\n\nsubsidiary, IBC/Donoghue, Inc.  Were this not so, the court would\r\n\nhave needed to  determine the appropriate measure  of damages for\r\n\nbreach of an obligation not to use Donoghue's name in a corporate\r\n\ntitle  rather than  declaring, as  it did  in the  passage quoted\r\n\nimmediately below, that Defendants-Appellees could not escape the\r\n\nobligation (or  \"requirement\") of  paying royalties if  they used\r\n\nDonoghue's  name in this way  and other conditions  for a royalty\r\n\nobligation were satisfied:\r\n\n          The fact  that  the plaintiff's  name is  now\r\n          part of the corporate name of the entity that\r\n          was  sold  to  IBC/USA  does  not  permit the\r\n          defendants  to  escape the  Personal Services\r\n          Agreement's  requirement  of  the payment  of\r\n          royalties for use of the  plaintiff's name in\r\n          the  title  of the  defendants' publications.\r\n          The  plaintiff is thus  likely to  prevail in\r\n          establishing that the use  of his name in the\r\n          titles  of  these  publications  without  the\r\n          payment    of     compensation    constitutes\r\n          unauthorized use in contravention of [clause]\r\n          11.\r\n\nId. at 953.\r            \r\n\n                               -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nC.

Although the  maxim is  acceptable  as a  statement of\r\n\n\"general  principle,\"  proceeding  on  the  assumption  that   no\r\n\nexception  applies to the case at hand  may lead to error, as the\r\n\ncase now before us illustrates.\r\n\n          One exception to the general principle is that  a court\r\n\nmay consider parol and extrinsic evidence for the very purpose of\r\n\n                               -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\ndeciding whether  the documentary  expression of the  contract is\r\n\nambiguous.  As this court has said once before:\r\n\n          In determining whether  an ambiguity  exists,\r                                                                \r\n          as a matter of  law, the [trier] may consider\r\n          parol and extrinsic evidence.  If the [trier]\r\n          determines  that  the  contract  in  question\r\n          contains  no ambiguity, then  no extrinsic or\r\n          parol evidence  is [to be considered  by] the\r\n          trier of fact . . . .\r\n\nBoston Edison  Co. v.

An agreement may\r\n\nbe ambiguous  in one  respect and  clear in  another.  The  legal\r\n\nconsequences that flow from a  determination of ambiguity in  one\r\n\nrespect do  not automatically  apply to  a  dispute over  another\r\n\nmatter as to which the agreement is clear.\r\n\n          In  other  words,  a  party claiming  to  benefit  from\r\n\nclarity  of an  agreement in  relation to  one kind  of potential\r\n\ndispute about meaning must  show that there is an  actual dispute\r\n\nbetween  the parties  about the  meaning of  the agreement  as to\r\n\nwhich the  asserted clear provision  is relevant.   Clarity about\r\n\nsome   hypothetical  issue   not   in   dispute  is   irrelevant.\r\n\nConversely,  a  party claiming  to  benefit  from ambiguity  (for\r\n\nexample,  by  being   allowed  to   proffer  extrinsic   evidence\r\n\nsupporting its interpretation) must show ambiguity in the meaning\r\n\nof  the  agreement with  respect to  the  very issue  in dispute.\r\n\n                               -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nDemonstration of ambiguity  in some respect  not material to  any\r\n\nexisting dispute serves no useful purpose.\r\n\n          Because  ambiguity  in  relation to  some  hypothetical\r\n\ndispute  that  has not  arisen  as  an  existing  controversy  is\r\n\nimmaterial, a court's determination regarding any ambiguity  that\r\n\nwill make a difference  in outcome must be made  with sensitivity\r\n\nto what are  the existing  genuine disputes  between the  parties\r\n\n(real and not merely hypothetical controversies).  Only by having\r\n\nthis understanding can  a court begin to  consider with precision\r\n\nand  particularity  the  alternative  meanings  proposed  by  the\r\n\ndisputing parties.\r\n\n          Thus, if  either or both  of the parties  proposes that\r\n\nextrinsic evidence should be received and considered by the court\r\n\nor by the finder of  facts (the jury in a jury trial or the judge\r\n\nas finder of facts in a nonjury proceeding), concrete proffers of\r\n\nthe proposed extrinsic evidence are important aids to the court's\r\n\nperforming  its function of  determining both whether  there is a\r\n\nmaterial ambiguity in the language  of the agreement and whether,\r                  \r\n\nfor that reason or  for some other reason, extrinsic  evidence is\r\n\nadmissible  and sufficient  to present  a genuine  dispute to  be\r\n\nresolved by a  finder of facts.   It will sometimes  be virtually\r\n\nimpossible for  a court  to determine  with confidence whether  a\r\n\ncontract is ambiguous in a material respect  or whether extrinsic\r\n\nevidence  should be admitted unless the court first knows what is\r\n\nthe  proffered  extrinsic  evidence,  and  what  is  the  alleged\r\n\nambiguity it allegedly addresses.\r\n\n                               -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          Although, at first glance, a court's proceeding in this\r\n\nway may seem  to subvert  the \"general principle\"  and the  parol\r\n\nevidence   rule  itself,   closer   examination  discloses   that\r\n\nproceeding in this way  facilitates decisions consistent with the\r\n\nprinciple,  the   rule  itself,  and   their  underlying   policy\r\n\nfoundations.   A  key point  is that courts  consider contentions\r\n\nregarding  ambiguity or lack of ambiguity not in the abstract and\r\n\nnot in relation to hypothetical disputes that a vivid imagination\r\n\nmay conceive but  instead in relation to  concrete disputes about\r\n\nthe  meaning  of   an  agreement  as   applied  to  an   existing\r\n\ncontroversy.  Often  the existing controversy arises  from a turn\r\n\nof events that  was not foreseen and addressed  by the parties in\r\n\ntheir negotiations.\r\n\n          When  invoking  a  standard   of  materiality  of   any\r\n\ndemonstrated ambiguity and reviewing proffered extrinsic evidence\r\n\nto determine whether that standard of materiality has been met, a\r\n\ncourt is proceeding  in a way compatible both  with Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw and with the  views of distinguished commentators on  the law\r\n\nof contracts.   The Supreme Judicial  Court of Massachusetts  has\r\n\nheld that  \"[a  contract] is  to  be read  in  the light  of  the\r\n\ncircumstances of its execution, which may enable the court to see\r\n\nthat its words are  really ambiguous.\"  Robert Indus.  v.

In  another case, the Supreme\r\n\nJudicial Court  affirmed the judgment of a trial court, observing\r\n\nthat \"[t]he judge  quite properly  heard evidence to  aid in  the\r\n\nconstruction of the agreement, even before he decided whether the\r\n\n                               -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nagreement was ambiguous.\"  Cullinet Software, Inc. v.

Donoghue\"   (argued  as  including   only  \"William\r\n\nDonoghue,  Bill Donoghue,  Will Donoghue,  Billy  Donoghue, etc.\"\r\n\nApp. at 00683) were used in the title of a publication.\r\n\n                               -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\n          The  proffered interpretations  of the  parties are  at\r\n\npolar extremes;  the district  court's interpretation,  though at\r\n\nneither pole, is closer to Donoghue's proposed interpretation.\r\n\n          These possible interpretations do not exhaust  the list\r\n\nof  plausible  possibilities,  however.    We  add  one  more  to\r\n\nillustrate the  point, making  clear, however,  that  we are  not\r\n\nmaking any ruling as  to the correct interpretation at  this time\r\n\nand do not mean our illustrative  suggestion to be given any more\r\n\nor different consideration in further proceedings than that given\r\n\nto   other   plausible   interpretations   of   the   documentary\r\n\nmanifestations of the agreement of the parties.\r\n\n          The   possible  interpretation   we  suggest   is  that\r\n\nDefendants-Appellees  were not free to change only the title of a\r\n\nproduct and nothing more, then continue to use Donoghue's name as\r\n\nbefore in the text  of the product, or packaging,  or promotional\r\n\nmaterials, and  thereby escape the royalty  obligation they would\r\n\nhave had  if Donoghue's name  had remained  in the  title.   This\r\n\npossible  turn of events was not explicitly addressed in the text\r\n\nof either the SPA or the PSA.\r\n\n          In thinking about whether  there was in the transaction\r\n\nas a  whole an implicit answer  for each turn of  events that has\r\n\noccurred,  one may consider what  most likely would have happened\r\n\nif  a  negotiator  had  explicitly  called  attention to  such  a\r\n\npossibility  during  negotiations.     For  example,  suppose   a\r\n\nnegotiator for the parties now designated as Defendants-Appellees\r\n\nhad stated during negotiations  that they understood the proposed\r\n\n                               -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nagreement  to be  that  they would  no  longer have  any  royalty\r\n\nobligation  if they just deleted the Donoghue name from the title\r\n\nof the product and continued to use the  Donoghue name within the\r\n\ntext of the product  and in advertizing the product.   Unless one\r\n\ncan   reasonably  say  it   is  likely   this  statement   of  an\r\n\nunderstanding not previously  expressed would have  been accepted\r\n\nand negotiations would have proceeded unruffled, the reasoning of\r\n\nthe district court about what the parties' agreement in this case\r\n\nunambiguously  means is unpersuasive.\r\n\n          Of  even greater  moment  in relation  to the  existing\r\n\ncontroversy between the parties in this case  is that a reader of\r\n\nthe full text of the two documents executed by the parties  might\r\n\nreasonably conclude that the parties had not explicitly addressed\r\n\nanother possible turn of events that later did  occur -- that IBC\r\n\nUSA would  decide to  create a  wholly-owned  subsidiary and  use\r\n\n\"Donoghue\"  in  its  corporate name.    Suppose  IBC USA,  during\r\n\nnegotiations, had openly  stated that it would interpret  the two\r\n\ndocuments together, as then drafted, to grant it the right to use\r\n\n\"Donoghue\" in a new corporate entity's name (and to do so without\r\n\nany royalty obligation as long as IBC USA and its  subsidiary did\r\n\nnot  include  \"Donoghue\"  in  the  name of  a  product).    Is it\r\n\nreasonable  to  believe that  such  a statement  would  have been\r\n\naccepted  by Donoghue,  without incident,  so negotiations  would\r\n\nthen have proceeded unruffled?\r\n\n          We believe that it is more appropriate at this time not\r                                                                           \r\n\nto determine whether  the agreement is ambiguous in  any material\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nrespect, not to determine whether or not extrinsic evidence about\r                      \r\n\nthe manifested meaning may be received, and not to make any final\r                                                         \r\n\nresolution  of   the  dispute  between  the   parties  about  the\r\n\nmanifested meaning of  the agreement.   Those matters are  better\r\n\nleft  to decision after the district court has before it proffers\r\n\nof proposed extrinsic evidence that might be admissible and might\r\n\nbear upon the final  decision about meaning in some  respect that\r\n\nis material to  an existing  controversy and not  merely to  some\r\n\nhypothetical  dispute.   The  district court  can  then make  the\r\n\ndecision  with  the benefit  of a  precise  focus on  proffers of\r\n\nextrinsic evidence proposed for admissibility  and consideration.\r\n\nAlso, the court  will have more assurance that  the case is being\r\n\ndecided on the merits and in a way consistent with the objectives\r\n\nunderlying  the parol  evidence  rule and  the general  principle\r\n\nregarding use of extrinsic evidence in determining the meaning of\r\n\nan integrated agreement.\r\n\n          Thus, our affirmance of the district court's order does\r\n\nnot  imply  approval of  the court's  reasoning  that the  PSA is\r\n\nunambiguous and what  it means  as to the  rights of  Defendants-\r\n\nAppellees  to use Donoghue's name  and as to  their obligation to\r\n\npay royalties  (previously designated as Ruling  One, Ruling Two,\r\n\nRuling  Three, and  Ruling Four).   We  conclude that  the issues\r\n\nregarding the scope  of the right to use  Donoghue's name and the\r\n\nrights  to royalties  should  not have  been  decided before  the\r\n\nparties  had  a reasonable  opportunity  to  develop the  factual\r\n\nrecord more fully.  We  explicitly do not make any rulings  as to\r                                                   \r\n\n                               -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nthe alleged ambiguity of the contract on any material issue or as\r\n\nto  whether extrinsic  evidence  may  appropriately be  received.\r\n\nThose  decisions  must be  made, in  the  first instance,  in the\r\n\ndistrict  court, after  opportunity  for the  parties to  proffer\r\n\nwhatever  extrinsic  evidence they  rely  upon  to support  their\r\n\nvarious contentions.\r\n\n           IV.  Support for the Preliminary Injunction\r                     IV.  Support for the Preliminary Injunction\r\n                       on the Terms Stated\r                                 on the Terms Stated\r\n\nA.  Conduct Enjoined\r          A.  Conduct Enjoined\r\n\n          Notwithstanding  our  determination  that some  of  the\r\n\nconclusions  reached by  the  district court  were premature,  we\r\n\naffirm the Preliminary Injunction  as entered.  We do  so because\r\n\nthere  is  ample   support  elsewhere  in  the   record  for  the\r\n\nPreliminary Injunction as fashioned by the district court.\r\n\n          The  Preliminary  Injunction  prevents the  Defendants-\r\n\nAppellees from  (1) distributing  materials in which  Donoghue is\r\n\nrepresented as criticizing a specific person or entity or stating\r\n\nthings inconsistent  with his  published views;  (2) distributing\r\n\nmaterials  with Donoghue's  photograph  or  likeness without  his\r\n\nprior written consent; and (3) using Donoghue's name in the title\r\n\nof a  publication  unless  royalty  payments  are  made.    These\r\n\nprohibitions are not very  onerous, and the findings of  fact and\r\n\nconclusions of law  of the  district court, apart  from those  we\r\n\nhave  determined  to be  premature,  amply  support granting  the\r\n\nPreliminary Injunction to the extent allowed.\r\n\n                               -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          First,  the district  court  found that  Donoghue is  a\r\n\nnationally known  investment advisor who  has a reputation  as an\r\n\nexpert in mutual and money market  funds.  As a result, the court\r\n\nconcluded that Donoghue's name was worthy of trademark protection\r\n\nunder the Lanham Act, 15  U.S.C.   1125(a).  Specifically  citing\r\n\nthis  court's decision in Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo., 9 F.3d  175 (1st  Cir. 1993), the  district court  concluded\r             \r\n\nthat  Donoghue's name  had  acquired \"secondary  meaning.\"   And,\r\n\nbecause  \"[t]he  likelihood of  confusion  in  the public's  mind\r\n\noccasioned  by an unauthorized use of the plaintiff's name by the\r\n\ndefendants is clear . . . any unauthorized use of the plaintiff's\r\n\nname by  the defendants would  constitute an infringement  of the\r\n\nplaintiff's  trademark  in  his   name.\"    Donoghue  v.  IBC/USA\r                                                                           \r\n\n(Publications) Inc., 886  F. Supp.  at 953.   Thus, Donoghue  was\r                             \r\n\nlikely to prevail on Count I of his complaint.\r\n\n          Second, the  district court  found that  the statements\r\n\nattributed to Donoghue  in the December 1994 direct  mailing were\r\n\nnot  consistent with  his  previous writings  and his  investment\r\n\nphilosophy.  Id.  As there was a specific consistency requirement\r                         \r\n\nin  Exhibit 12  to  the  PSA,  App.  at  00057,  such  attributed\r\n\nstatements were unauthorized.  Thus, the district court concluded\r\n\nthat Donoghue was  likely to  prevail on his  breach of  contract\r\n\nclaim (Count IV).\r\n\n          Third, the district  court concluded that Donoghue  was\r\n\nlikely to prevail on his claim that the Defendants-Appellees used\r\n\nhis name and photograph  in a manner that violated  Mass. Gen. L.\r\n\n                               -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nch. 214    3A (Count II).   The section of the  statute quoted by\r\n\nthe district court reads:\r\n\n          Any person whose name, portrait or picture is\r\n          used within the commonwealth  for advertising\r\n          purposes or for the purposes of trade without\r\n          his written consent may  bring a civil action\r\n          in the  superior court against  the person so\r\n          using  his  name,  portrait  or  picture,  to\r\n          prevent and restrain the use thereof . . . .\r\n\nMass. Gen.  L. ch. 214   3A.   The court found  that \"[w]hile the\r\n\nplaintiff  previously  authorized  the  defendants'  use  of  his\r\n\npicture, it is  clear that he does  not do so now.\"   Donoghue v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nIBC/USA  (Publications),  Inc.,  886  F.  Supp.  at  954.   Thus,\r                                        \r\n\nDonoghue was likely to prevail on Count II.\r\n\n          Finally,  the  district   court  rejected   Defendants-\r\n\nAppellees' affirmative defense that Donoghue had \"unclean hands.\"\r\n\nUnder  the precedent of this  circuit, a district  court has wide\r\n\ndiscretion  in deciding  whether  to bar  recovery  based upon  a\r\n\nplaintiff's alleged \"unclean  hands.\"  K  Mart Corp. v.  Oriental\r                                                                           \r\n\nPlaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 912 (1st Cir. 1989)(citing Codex Corp.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Milgro Elec. Corp., 717  F.2d 622, 633 (1st Cir.  1983), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 446  U.S. 931 (1984)).   Given  the record before  us, we\r                \r\n\ncannot  say   that  the   district   court's  finding   regarding\r\n\nDefendants-Appellees'   unclean   hands   defense   was   clearly\r\n\nerroneous.\r\n\n          Thus,  there  is  ample  support in  the  record  for a\r\n\nPreliminary Injunction as entered in this case.  Although we have\r\n\ndetermined that a few of  the rulings made by the district  court\r\n\n                               -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nwere premature, these rulings,  if error either on the  merits or\r\n\nbecause prematurely decided, were only harmless error.\r\n\nB.  Rejection of Other Injunctive Relief\r          B.  Rejection of Other Injunctive Relief\r\n\n          Plaintiff-Appellant Donoghue has appealed the  order of\r\n\nthe  district court  because  he had  requested  a more  sweeping\r\n\npreliminary  injunction  than  the  one granted.    We  conclude,\r\n\nhowever, that  just as there is  ample support in the  record for\r\n\nthe relief  ordered in  the Preliminary  Injunction, so  also are\r\n\nthere sound reasons for not ordering relief of greater scope.\r\n\n          Donoghue contends that the Defendants-Appellees are not\r\n\nallowed to use  his name even in the text  of publications and in\r\n\npromotional  materials; his  motion for a  preliminary injunction\r\n\nrequested  that the district court  so order.   App. at 00072-73.\r\n\nDonoghue admits, however, that Defendants-Appellees are permitted\r\n\nto use his name in the title of publications as long  as they pay\r\n\nhim the required  5% royalty.   He also  admits that  Defendants-\r\n\nAppellees  are  permitted  to  use his  name  in  the  text of  a\r\n\npublication if his name is also in the title of that publication.\r\n\n          Thus, Donoghue's argument for greater injunctive relief\r\n\nthan that granted  can be  seen as an  argument that  Defendants-\r\n\nAppellees  are not  permitted to use  his name  in the  text of a\r\n\nproduct unless his  name appears in the title  of that product as\r\n\nwell.   And  because  any use  of  his name  in  the title  of  a\r\n\npublication requires a royalty  payment, Donoghue is thus arguing\r\n\nthat any  authorized use of his name in the text of a publication\r\n\n                               -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nrequires a royalty  payment.   The harm, then,  that Donoghue  is\r\n\nseeking to prevent by his request for a more sweeping preliminary\r\n\ninjunction  is primarily,  if  not entirely,  delayed receipt  of\r\n\nroyalty payments--a kind of harm ordinarily redressed by an award\r\n\nof monetary  damages.   \"But  an  entitlement to  money  damages,\r\n\nwithout more, rarely constitutes an adequate basis for injunctive\r\n\nrelief.\"  CMM Cable  Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast  Properties, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n48 F.3d 618, 622 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          We conclude  that the district  court did not  make any\r\n\nerror of law  or clearly erroneous finding  of fact, and  did not\r\n\nabuse its discretion  in determining that Donoghue  has not shown\r\n\nthat  irreparable  harm will  result from  a  failure to  enter a\r\n\npreliminary  injunction as broad as he seeks.  The district court\r\n\nsupportably determined  that if  an entitlement to  money damages\r\n\naccrues during  the pendency of this litigation, a monetary award\r\n\nat the conclusion of the case will be an adequate remedy.\r\n\n                          V.  Conclusion\r                                    V.  Conclusion\r\n\n          For the  reasons explained in Parts  I-III, we conclude\r\n\nthat the record  before the  district court when  it ordered  the\r\n\nPreliminary  Injunction and now before us  is insufficient for us\r\n\nto determine whether  the four rulings  identified in Part  III.B\r\n\nwere erroneous as  a matter of law.   Therefore, we explicitly do\r\n\nnot rely  on these  rulings in  reaching our  decision.  We  also\r\n\ndetermine, however, for the  reasons stated in Part IV,  that the\r\n\norder for entry of the Preliminary Injunction on the terms stated\r\n\n                               -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nwas adequately supported by other findings and conclusions of the\r\n\ndistrict court.  That  being so, we conclude  that the errors  of\r\n\nlaw,  if any,  in the  four rulings  identified were  harmless in\r\n\nrelation to the issues before us in this appeal.\r\n\n          The district court's order for entry of the Preliminary\r\n\nInjunction is \r\n\n          AFFIRMED.\r                    AFFIRMED\r\n\n                               -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n",

Before July 1989</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donoghue is an investment adviser well-known as an expert on money markets and mutual funds.  Acting individually and through a number of corporate entities, he has marketed advice for more than twenty years in books, newsletters, columns, on-line services, and public appearances.  One of his business entities was The Donoghue Organization, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation of which Donoghue was the sole stockholder.  Its flagship publication was Donoghue's MoneyLetter--a semi-monthly newsletter introduced by Donoghue in 1980.  In 1986, Donoghue's MoneyLetter was voted \"Best Financial Advisory Newsletter\" by the Newsletter Association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Documents Dated July 28, 1989</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simultaneously, two documents were executed.  Though signed by Donoghue in September 1989, these agreements were made \"as of\" July 28, 1989.  They were called the Stock Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") and the Personal Services and Non-Competition Agreement (\"PSA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Stock Purchase Agreement was signed by Donoghue as sole shareholder of The Donoghue Organization, Inc. and Mary Ann Bonomo as Vice President of IBC USA (Publications), Inc.  (\"IBC USA\").  Under the terms of the SPA, Defendant-Appellant IBC USA purchased all 10,000 shares of Common Stock of The Donoghue Organization, Inc. from Donoghue for $2,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Personal Services and Non-Competition Agreement was also signed by Donoghue and Mary Ann Bonomo.  Under the terms of the PSA, Donoghue became a part-time employee of IBC USA, agreeing to devote approximately one-third of his professional time to editorial, promotional, and other activities mainly involving the MoneyLetter publication.  The initial term of the PSA was set at five years, with one five-year extension available at the option of IBC USA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A central subject of dispute in this litigation is the scope and extent of the right of IBC USA and its new wholly owned subsidiary, IBC/Donoghue, Inc., also a Defendant-Appellee, to use Donoghue's name.  The contractual rights of the Defendants-Appellees are controlled by the SPA and the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A provision of the SPA declares:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>The rights to use the name \"William E. Donoghue\" and variations thereof have always been the property of the Seller [Donoghue], not the Company [The Donoghue Organization, Inc.], and Buyer's [IBC USA's] rights to the use of such name are governed by the Personal Services Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPA cl. 3(m).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSA elaborates on the rights to use the name \"William E.

Donoghue or any variation thereof in any registered or unregistered trademark, to Employee, provided that an agreement for continued use by IBC/USA has not been concluded, but nothing herein shall be deemed to grant any right, title or interest, or any agreement to grant any right, title or interest, to Employee in or to any name or mark (registered or unregistered) or portion thereof not constituting the name William E. Donoghue or a variation thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PSA cl. 11.  The dispute between the parties centers primarily upon the interpretation of this clause and relevant statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>C. Developments Before Amendment of the PSA on July 21, 1994</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the currently alleged deficiencies in the clarity and specificity of the SPA and PSA, and in the performance of each party under these agreements, the first five-year term of the PSA passed relatively uneventfully.  During this term, IBC USA changed the corporate name of The Donoghue Organization, Inc. to IBC/Donoghue, Inc.;   Donoghue contributed articles to Donoghue's MoneyLetter and performed various other duties under terms of the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to clause 2(b) of the PSA, IBC USA was required to give notice to Donoghue one year before the last day of the term of the PSA if IBC USA wished to exercise its option to extend the term of the PSA for an additional five years.  In early July of 1993, before the one-year benchmark of July 28, 1993, IBC USA initiated discussions with Donoghue regarding the possibility of amending the PSA before extending it for the additional five-year term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBC USA proposed to restructure the compensation provisions of the PSA, primarily to eliminate the 5% royalty that would have first begun to accrue when the second five-year term commenced.  In return, IBC USA proposed to increase various incentive payments to Donoghue, based on the number of telephone inquiries generated by his columns, appearances, and books.  The record is unclear about how this proposal, or negotiations relating to it, proceeded or whether any progress was made toward amending the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, on July 16, 1993, IBC USA gave formal notice to Donoghue of its desire to exercise its options under clauses 2(b) and 11 of the PSA to extend, for an additional five years, to July 29, 1999, the term of (1) Donoghue's employment and (2) the license to use his name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>D. Amendment of the PSA on July 21, 1994 and the Failure of Negotiations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negotiations regarding an amendment of the PSA continued as the first five-year term was coming to a close.  On July 21, 1994, just before the end of the initial five-year term of the PSA, the parties executed a modification of the agreement.  This modification extended for one month the time period in which IBC USA could use Donoghue's name without paying the 5% royalty:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>IBC/USA will continue to have the right to use the name William E. Donoghue and variations thereof on or in connection with the existing products of IBC/USA without payment of the stated 5% royalty until August 31, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. at 00062.  In return for this concession, IBC USA allowed Donoghue to send his employees to IBC USA's weekly Donoghue's MoneyLetter Investment Committee meetings during the month of August, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interim provision delaying the time when the 5% royalty payments would begin to accrue was itself modified, with Donoghue's consent.  The commencing date when royalty payments would begin was moved to October 31, 1994.  Negotiations regarding a permanent amendment to the PSA, however, were unsuccessful.  The parties never agreed to any further amendment of the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the final interim extension was about to end in October, 1994, Defendants-Appellees removed Donoghue's surname from Donoghue's MoneyLetter, making the new title simply MoneyLetter.   The name of the corporate subsidiary remained IBC/Donoghue, Inc., however, and MoneyLetter continued to contain references to Donoghue and his name within the text of the newsletter.  For example, one section of the newsletter was devoted to the \"Donoghue Signal,\" a statistical measure of market performance.  Also, MoneyLetter was labeled as \"a service of IBC/Donoghue, Inc.\" on the bottom of the first page.  William E. Donoghue was listed in the masthead as \"Founder &amp; Contributing Editor\" of MoneyLetter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants-Appellees now no longer publish anything with the name \"William E. Donoghue\" appearing in the name of the publication, but they do market publications in which the corporate name IBC/Donoghue is used within the title.  Examples are IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Average, IBC/Donoghue's Mutual Funds Almanac, and IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Directory.   IBC USA has not paid Donoghue any royalties (under either the $1,000-per-year or the 5% provision) since October of 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Other Developments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precipitating event for the current civil action, however, was not the use of Donoghue's name in the name or text of any newsletter or the nonpayment of royalties but rather the use of Donoghue's name and likeness in promotional materials advertising MoneyLetter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1994, IBC USA sent a direct mail advertisement for MoneyLetter to the general investing public and the professional investment community.  The envelope in which this mailing was sent featured a photograph of Donoghue purportedly gesturing at advertisements of five large mutual fund companies.  Above the photograph was a statement in large type and in quotation marks:  \"I'm sick and tired of investors getting ripped-off by ads like these!\"   There were similar statements in smaller type below the photograph and on the back of the envelope as well.  The district court found that Donoghue had neither made nor authorized any of the statements on the envelope.  Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications), Inc., 886 F.Supp. 947, 951 (D.Mass.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also found that, \"[w]hile [Donoghue] had used strong language in the past to criticize techniques and motives of financial planners and brokers, he had not previously criticized mutual funds by name in the manner portrayed on the envelope.\"  Id.  Inside the envelope was a letter, purportedly signed by Donoghue, that further criticized the advertisements of such mutual fund companies as Value Line, Fidelity Investments, Dreyfus Corporation, Berger Associates, Inc., and Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, Inc.  The district court found that Donoghue had not authorized this letter.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donoghue received two written complaints regarding the direct mail advertisement--from Berger Associates, Inc. and Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, Inc.  App. at 00304-09.  Moreover, Value Line threatened litigation against Donoghue and has since filed an action in federal court for the Southern District of New York against IBC USA and IBC/Donoghue, Inc. claiming that it has been injured by the \"explicitly false,\" \"deceptive,\" and \"misleading\" statements in the direct mail campaign.  App. at 00319.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Forbes magazine columnist's comment, published under the date April 24, 1995, publicly criticized Donoghue for the statements attributed to him in this MoneyLetter promotional mailing and for continued promotion of the \"Donoghue Signal\" by touting hypothetical results that would have been achieved had an investor used the \"Donoghue Signal\" over a period commencing in 1980, even though the \"Donoghue Signal\" was first introduced in 1988.  The columnist observed that use of such \"back-tested\" results was inconsistent with the published views of Donoghue himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately two weeks after the publication of the Forbes piece, on May 8, 1995, Donoghue commenced this civil action, claiming infringement of the trademark in his name under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125 (Count I);  improper use of his name and photograph in violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 214, Sec. 3A (Count II);  trademark infringement under the common law (Count III);  breach of contract, including the obligation to pay royalties (Count IV);  and violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A (Count V).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>II. The District Court Decision of Donoghue's Motion for</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Preliminary Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon counts I and II, Donoghue filed on May 8, 1995, along with his complaint, a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.  Donoghue asked the court to enjoin the Defendants-Appellees from distributing any newsletter, publication or promotional materials:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>upon which the name William E. Donoghue or any variation thereof (including but not limited to \"Donoghue,\" the \"Donoghue Signal,\" \"IBC/Donoghue\" or \"IBC/Donoghue, Inc.\") appears, or upon which any picture of plaintiff William E. Donoghue appears....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. at 00073.  The only ways in which the Defendants-Appellees would have been able to use Donoghue's name under this requested injunction would have been as a by-line for an article actually written by Donoghue or in the masthead of MoneyLetter with the title \"Founder &amp; Contributing Editor.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing on May 10, 1995, the district court entered a temporary restraining order of a more limited scope than Donoghue had requested.  On May 26, 1995, after further briefing by the parties, the district court granted Donoghue's motion for a preliminary injunction.  The Preliminary Injunction fashioned by the district court, however, like the Temporary Restraining Order that preceded it, was significantly narrower in scope than Donoghue had requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of granting a blanket prohibition on the use of Donoghue's name, the district court focused on the alleged harmful actively of the Defendants-Appellees.  As a result, the court required only that the Defendants-Appellees:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>1. refrain from distributing to any customer or potential customer or anyone else any advertising or promotional materials or any other material in which William E. Donoghue is represented as criticizing or otherwise commenting on any specific person or entity and any other material which represents William E. Donoghue as stating things which are inconsistent with his views as stated in his previously published material;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>2. refrain from distributing to any customer or potential customer or anyone else material which contains William E. Donoghue's photograph, portrait or likeness, without the plaintiff's express prior written consent;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>3. refrain from distributing to any customer or potential customer or anyone else any material in which the name \"William E. Donoghue\" or any variation thereof appears in the title of the material, unless the defendants pay the plaintiff royalties pursuant to [clause] 11 of the Personal Sales [sic] Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications), Inc., 886 F.Supp. at 955.   In fashioning this Preliminary Injunction, the district court properly considered (1) the likelihood of Donoghue's success on the merits;  (2) whether Donoghue would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were not granted;  (3) the injury to Defendants-Appellees from granting the injunction;  and (4) whether the public interest would be adversely affected by the injunction.  See Keds Corp. v. Renee Intern. Trading Corp., 888 F.2d 215, 220 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the order of the district court was proper in the circumstances of this case.  Some of the supporting findings and conclusions of the district court in arriving at this order, however, were possibly erroneous and, in our view, they were prematurely decided, as explained below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Contract Interpretation Issues</p>\n    <p>A. Introduction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a court looks to the words of a document to consider the meaning of those words in the context of the agreement, the search is for manifested meaning, not a privately held belief or intent of one party, not communicated to other parties to the bargain.  See Rose-Derry Corp. v. Proctor &amp; Schwartz, Inc., 288 Mass. 332, 193 N.E. 50, 52 (1934).  Moreover, if the parties execute two or more documents, with a manifested intent that the documents together express their entire agreement, a court reads the documents together, rather than construing each as if it stood alone.  FDIC v. Singh, 977 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the initial agreement was expressed in the two documents dated July 28, 1989.  By their own terms they manifest an understanding that together they completely express one integrated agreement.  For example, clause 2 of the SPA reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>Other Agreements.   Simultaneously with the Closing Seller and Buyer shall enter into a Personal Services and Non-Competition Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 2 (the \"Personal Services Agreement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. at 00026.  Also, as previously noted, clause 3(m) of the SPA explicitly states that the rights to use Donoghue's name are governed by the PSA.  Accordingly, we read the two documents together, as we understand the district court to have done as well, when searching for manifested meaning relevant to any existing dispute between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>B. The District Court's Interpretation of the Royalty Provisions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statements of the district court explaining its order for entry of the Preliminary Injunction are subject to being interpreted as including several distinct and potentially significant rulings as a matter of law, all made as part of the court's reasoned decision to grant the Preliminary Injunction in the precise terms fashioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss these rulings separately as well as together.  We have chosen the order in which we discuss them for convenience only;  we explicitly do not imply that this order of consideration is compelled by precedent or logic.  Indeed, we conclude that the several rulings are interrelated in ways that make it appropriate for a court to consider all of them before deciding any.  Our separation of the district court's combined determination into four parts and our designation of those parts as \"First Ruling,\" \"Second Ruling,\" \"Third Ruling,\" and \"Fourth Ruling\" are our formulations made only to facilitate reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the phrasing of these four rulings is ours, not that of the litigants.  We have chosen this phrasing to express what we understand to be the substantive content of the determinations of the district court, explicit and implicit.  Each of the parties to this appeal has chosen somewhat different phrasings, which we find to be ambiguous.  Examples include the contrasting statements of the parties about whether the district court ruled that a use of Donoghue's name was:  (1) permissible without regard to whether the use would result in a royalty obligation, or (2) permissible only on condition that royalties be paid, or (3) permissible only on condition that the user explicitly acknowledge a royalty obligation (without, however, stating the precise conditions that would determine the fact and the amount of the royalty obligation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have chosen this course of stating our reading of the meaning of the district court's rulings, including reasonable inferences about implicit assumptions as well as explicit declarations, because the scope of this court's authority and responsibility is not limited to choosing one or the other of partisan descriptions of the district court's reasoning.  We examine that reasoning from the perspective of impartial appellate review, and not through partisan lenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Ruling.   The district court ruled that the agreement of the parties was unambiguous--not only with respect to the scope and extent of the rights of Defendants-Appellees to use the name of William E. Donoghue but also with respect to the amount of royalties they would have to pay as a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Ruling.   The district court ruled that the agreement unambiguously meant that Defendants-Appellees were free to remove Donoghue's name from the name of a product and continue to use Donoghue's name within the text of the product and in materials marketing the product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third Ruling.   The district court ruled that the agreement unambiguously meant that, when exercising their rights under the Second Ruling, Defendants-Appellees would incur no obligation to pay any royalties during the second five-year term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth Ruling.   The district court implicitly ruled that the agreement authorized Defendants-Appellees to use Donoghue's name in the corporate title of the wholly-owned subsidiary, IBC/Donoghue, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching the Second and Third rulings, the district court included, as steps of reasoning, the following interpretation of clause 11 of the PSA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Clause] 11 only requires the IBC/USA to pay the plaintiff royalties for use of the plaintiff's name on revenues received \"from the sale ... of products or services including such name in the name thereof.\"  (Emphasis added.)   The plain language of this provision does not require the payment of royalties for use of the plaintiff's name in connection with the defendants' products, as long as the plaintiff's name does not appear in \"the name\" of the products.  The plaintiff's argument that it was his understanding that he was entitled to royalties for all uses of his name does not alter the plain meaning of [clause] 11.  \"As a general principle, a court considers extrinsic evidence to discern intent only when a contract term is ambiguous.\"  Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. v. Danvers, 411 Mass. 39, 577 N.E.2d 283, 289 (1991), citing Merrimack Valley Nat'l Bank v. Baird, 372 Mass. 721, 363 N.E.2d 688 (1977).  See also FDIC v. Singh, 977 F.2d 18, 24 (1st Cir.1992).  Because [clause] 11 is not ambiguous, this court will not consider extrinsic evidence of the parties' understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications) Inc., 886 F.Supp. 947, 951-52 (D.Mass.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donoghue contended that this interpretation was in conflict with both the PSA and the interim amendment to the PSA executed July 21, 1994.  In the next paragraph of its Memorandum, however, the district court rejected the contention that the July 21, 1994 amendment was inconsistent with the court's reading of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff claims that [clause] 11 was changed by an amendment to the Personal Services Agreement, dated July 21, 1994. That amendment allowed IBC/USA to \"continue to have the right to use the name William E. Donoghue and variations thereof on or in connection with the existing products of IBC/USA without payment of the stated 5% royalty until August 31, 1994.\"   The plaintiff claims that this amendment implies that the 5% royalty was required to be paid on use of the plaintiff's name even if the name did not appear in the title of the defendants' publications.  Otherwise, argues the plaintiff, there would have been no reason to include the phrase \"in connection with the existing products.\"   The court does not agree with the plaintiff's analysis.  The language of the amendment tracks the language of [clause] 11, which permitted IBC/USA to \"use the name William E. Donoghue and variations thereof on or in connection with any and all of the existing products and services of IBC/USA.\"   The amendment's addition, \"without payment of the stated 5% royalty \" clearly refers to the royalty provision of [clause] 11.  Rather than change the circumstances giving rise to the right to receive a royalty, the amendment only forgave the payment of royalties which would otherwise have been due under paragraph 11, i.e., royalties flowing from the sale of products in which the plaintiff's name appears in the name.  IBC/USA's right to use the name as before continued.  The royalty obligation was suspended for the period stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 952 (emphasis in original).  Because IBC USA had removed Donoghue's name from the title of MoneyLetter, the district court concluded that Donoghue was not entitled to any royalties even though his name was being used in the text of MoneyLetter through reference to such things as the \"Donoghue Signal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the district court also concluded that the use of the corporate name IBC/Donoghue in the title of various publications (IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Average, IBC/Donoghue's Mutual Funds Almanac and IBC/Donoghue Money Fund Directory ) was an invalid use of Donoghue's name under the PSA unless royalties were paid.   This \"unless\" clause implies that the district court made what we have designated as its Fourth Ruling--Defendants-Appellees were authorized by the agreement to use Donoghue's name in the corporate title of the wholly-owned subsidiary, IBC/Donoghue, Inc.  Were this not so, the court would have needed to determine the appropriate measure of damages for breach of an obligation not to use Donoghue's name in a corporate title rather than declaring, as it did in the passage quoted immediately below, that Defendants-Appellees could not escape the obligation (or \"requirement\") of paying royalties if they used Donoghue's name in this way and other conditions for a royalty obligation were satisfied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>The fact that the plaintiff's name is now part of the corporate name of the entity that was sold to IBC/USA does not permit the defendants to escape the Personal Services Agreement's requirement of the payment of royalties for use of the plaintiff's name in the title of the defendants' publications.  The plaintiff is thus likely to prevail in establishing that the use of his name in the titles of these publications without the payment of compensation constitutes unauthorized use in contravention of [clause] 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 953.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>C. Procedures for Resolving Disputes Over the Meaning of an Agreement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How is a court to proceed when confronted with disputes between parties about the meaning of an agreement they made?   Does it matter that all parties assert that the agreement is unambiguous, even though they seek very different rulings about what the agreement unambiguously means?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our description of an appropriate procedure for working out an answer to these questions in this case, we need not and do not purport to decide that the method we describe here is appropriate for all cases.  We do determine that this method is appropriate for our review of the four rulings of the district court we have identified above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching its First, Second, and Third rulings, the district court excluded all consideration of extrinsic evidence.  In support of this decision, the court cited \"the parol evidence rule\" as described in the following maxim.  \"As a general principle, a court considers extrinsic evidence to discern intent only when a contract term is ambiguous.\"  Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications) Inc., 886 F.Supp. at 952 (quoting Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. v. Danvers, 411 Mass. 39, 577 N.E.2d 283, 289 (1991)).  Although the maxim is acceptable as a statement of \"general principle,\" proceeding on the assumption that no exception applies to the case at hand may lead to error, as the case now before us illustrates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One exception to the general principle is that a court may consider parol and extrinsic evidence for the very purpose of deciding whether the documentary expression of the contract is ambiguous.  As this court has said once before:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>In determining whether an ambiguity exists, as a matter of law, the [trier] may consider parol and extrinsic evidence.  If the [trier] determines that the contract in question contains no ambiguity, then no extrinsic or parol evidence is [to be considered by] the trier of fact....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston Edison Co. v. F.E.R.C., 856 F.2d 361, 367 n. 3 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting Sunstream Jet Express, Inc. v. Int'l Air Service Co., 734 F.2d 1258, 1268 (7th Cir.1984)) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second exception to the general principle flows from the recognition that ambiguity is not an all-or-nothing characteristic of any set of words and phrases.  An agreement may be ambiguous in one respect and clear in another.  The legal consequences that flow from a determination of ambiguity in one respect do not automatically apply to a dispute over another matter as to which the agreement is clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, a party claiming to benefit from clarity of an agreement in relation to one kind of potential dispute about meaning must show that there is an actual dispute between the parties about the meaning of the agreement as to which the asserted clear provision is relevant.  Clarity about some hypothetical issue not in dispute is irrelevant.  Conversely, a party claiming to benefit from ambiguity (for example, by being allowed to proffer extrinsic evidence supporting its interpretation) must show ambiguity in the meaning of the agreement with respect to the very issue in dispute.  Demonstration of ambiguity in some respect not material to any existing dispute serves no useful purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because ambiguity in relation to some hypothetical dispute that has not arisen as an existing controversy is immaterial, a court's determination regarding any ambiguity that will make a difference in outcome must be made with sensitivity to what are the existing genuine disputes between the parties (real and not merely hypothetical controversies).  Only by having this understanding can a court begin to consider with precision and particularity the alternative meanings proposed by the disputing parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if either or both of the parties proposes that extrinsic evidence should be received and considered by the court or by the finder of facts (the jury in a jury trial or the judge as finder of facts in a nonjury proceeding), concrete proffers of the proposed extrinsic evidence are important aids to the court's performing its function of determining both whether there is a material ambiguity in the language of the agreement and whether, for that reason or for some other reason, extrinsic evidence is admissible and sufficient to present a genuine dispute to be resolved by a finder of facts.  It will sometimes be virtually impossible for a court to determine with confidence whether a contract is ambiguous in a material respect or whether extrinsic evidence should be admitted unless the court first knows what is the proffered extrinsic evidence, and what is the alleged ambiguity it allegedly addresses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although, at first glance, a court's proceeding in this way may seem to subvert the \"general principle\" and the parol evidence rule itself, closer examination discloses that proceeding in this way facilitates decisions consistent with the principle, the rule itself, and their underlying policy foundations.  A key point is that courts consider contentions regarding ambiguity or lack of ambiguity not in the abstract and not in relation to hypothetical disputes that a vivid imagination may conceive but instead in relation to concrete disputes about the meaning of an agreement as applied to an existing controversy.  Often the existing controversy arises from a turn of events that was not foreseen and addressed by the parties in their negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When invoking a standard of materiality of any demonstrated ambiguity and reviewing proffered extrinsic evidence to determine whether that standard of materiality has been met, a court is proceeding in a way compatible both with Massachusetts law and with the views of distinguished commentators on the law of contracts.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has held that \"[a contract] is to be read in the light of the circumstances of its execution, which may enable the court to see that its words are really ambiguous.\"  Robert Indus. v. Spence, 362 Mass. 751, 291 N.E.2d 407, 409 (1973).  In another case, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the judgment of a trial court, observing that \"[t]he judge quite properly heard evidence to aid in the construction of the agreement, even before he decided whether the agreement was ambiguous.\"  Cullinet Software, Inc. v. McCormack &amp; Dodge Corp., 400 Mass. 775, 511 N.E.2d 1101, 1102 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These Massachusetts decisions comport with the views of Professors Corbin and Farnsworth.  \"The writing can not prove its own completeness and accuracy....  The evidence that the [parol evidence] rule seems to exclude must sometimes be heard and weighed before it can be excluded by the rule.\"   Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts Sec. 582 at 448-50 (1960), quoted in, E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts Sec. 7.3 at 474 (2d ed. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p>D. Unresolved Issues Regarding Ambiguity and Potentially Admissible Extrinsic Evidence in This Case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The manifested meaning of the agreement of the parties, as interpreted by the district court in the passages from its Memorandum of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law quoted in Part III.B above, satisfied none of the parties to this case.  Donoghue had sought to bar the Defendants-Appellees from using his name at all without permission and payment of the 5% royalty.  The Defendants-Appellees, on the other hand, contended that they were licensed to use Donoghue's name freely in any manner they chose, as part of the official name of the wholly-owned corporate subsidiary as well as in publications.  They also contended that they would incur royalty obligations only if variations of \"William E. Donoghue\" (argued as including only \"William Donoghue, Bill Donoghue, Will Donoghue, Billy Donoghue, etc.\"   App. at 00683) were used in the title of a publication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proffered interpretations of the parties are at polar extremes;  the district court's interpretation, though at neither pole, is closer to Donoghue's proposed interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These possible interpretations do not exhaust the list of plausible possibilities, however.  We add one more to illustrate the point, making clear, however, that we are not making any ruling as to the correct interpretation at this time and do not mean our illustrative suggestion to be given any more or different consideration in further proceedings than that given to other plausible interpretations of the documentary manifestations of the agreement of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possible interpretation we suggest is that Defendants-Appellees were not free to change only the title of a product and nothing more, then continue to use Donoghue's name as before in the text of the product, or packaging, or promotional materials, and thereby escape the royalty obligation they would have had if Donoghue's name had remained in the title.  This possible turn of events was not explicitly addressed in the text of either the SPA or the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In thinking about whether there was in the transaction as a whole an implicit answer for each turn of events that has occurred, one may consider what most likely would have happened if a negotiator had explicitly called attention to such a possibility during negotiations.  For example, suppose a negotiator for the parties now designated as Defendants-Appellees had stated during negotiations that they understood the proposed agreement to be that they would no longer have any royalty obligation if they just deleted the Donoghue name from the title of the product and continued to use the Donoghue name within the text of the product and in advertising the product.  Unless one can reasonably say it is likely this statement of an understanding not previously expressed would have been accepted and negotiations would have proceeded unruffled, the reasoning of the district court about what the parties' agreement in this case unambiguously means is unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of even greater moment in relation to the existing controversy between the parties in this case is that a reader of the full text of the two documents executed by the parties might reasonably conclude that the parties had not explicitly addressed another possible turn of events that later did occur--that IBC USA would decide to create a wholly-owned subsidiary and use \"Donoghue\" in its corporate name.  Suppose IBC USA, during negotiations, had openly stated that it would interpret the two documents together, as then drafted, to grant it the right to use \"Donoghue\" in a new corporate entity's name (and to do so without any royalty obligation as long as IBC USA and its subsidiary did not include \"Donoghue\" in the name of a product).  Is it reasonable to believe that such a statement would have been accepted by Donoghue, without incident, so negotiations would then have proceeded unruffled?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that it is more appropriate at this time not to determine whether the agreement is ambiguous in any material respect, not to determine whether or not extrinsic evidence about the manifested meaning may be received, and not to make any final resolution of the dispute between the parties about the manifested meaning of the agreement.  Those matters are better left to decision after the district court has before it proffers of proposed extrinsic evidence that might be admissible and might bear upon the final decision about meaning in some respect that is material to an existing controversy and not merely to some hypothetical dispute.  The district court can then make the decision with the benefit of a precise focus on proffers of extrinsic evidence proposed for admissibility and consideration.  Also, the court will have more assurance that the case is being decided on the merits and in a way consistent with the objectives underlying the parol evidence rule and the general principle regarding use of extrinsic evidence in determining the meaning of an integrated agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our affirmance of the district court's order does not imply approval of the court's reasoning that the PSA is unambiguous and what it means as to the rights of Defendants-Appellees to use Donoghue's name and as to their obligation to pay royalties (previously designated as Ruling One, Ruling Two, Ruling Three, and Ruling Four).  We conclude that the issues regarding the scope of the right to use Donoghue's name and the rights to royalties should not have been decided before the parties had a reasonable opportunity to develop the factual record more fully.  We explicitly do not make any rulings as to the alleged ambiguity of the contract on any material issue or as to whether extrinsic evidence may appropriately be received.  Those decisions must be made, in the first instance, in the district court, after opportunity for the parties to proffer whatever extrinsic evidence they rely upon to support their various contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>IV.

We do so because there is ample support elsewhere in the record for the Preliminary Injunction as fashioned by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Preliminary Injunction prevents the Defendants-Appellees from (1) distributing materials in which Donoghue is represented as criticizing a specific person or entity or stating things inconsistent with his published views;  (2) distributing materials with Donoghue's photograph or likeness without his prior written consent;  and (3) using Donoghue's name in the title of a publication unless royalty payments are made.  These prohibitions are not very onerous, and the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the district court, apart from those we have determined to be premature, amply support granting the Preliminary Injunction to the extent allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court found that Donoghue is a nationally known investment advisor who has a reputation as an expert in mutual and money market funds.  As a result, the court concluded that Donoghue's name was worthy of trademark protection under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a).  Specifically citing this court's decision in Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., 9 F.3d 175 (1st Cir.1993), the district court concluded that Donoghue's name had acquired \"secondary meaning.\"   And, because \"[t]he likelihood of confusion in the public's mind occasioned by an unauthorized use of the plaintiff's name by the defendants is clear ... any unauthorized use of the plaintiff's name by the defendants would constitute an infringement of the plaintiff's trademark in his name.\"  Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications) Inc., 886 F.Supp. at 953.   Thus, Donoghue was likely to prevail on Count I of his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court found that the statements attributed to Donoghue in the December 1994 direct mailing were not consistent with his previous writings and his investment philosophy.  Id.  As there was a specific consistency requirement in Exhibit 12 to the PSA, App. at 00057, such attributed statements were unauthorized.  Thus, the district court concluded that Donoghue was likely to prevail on his breach of contract claim (Count IV).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the district court concluded that Donoghue was likely to prevail on his claim that the Defendants-Appellees used his name and photograph in a manner that violated Mass.Gen.L. ch. 214 Sec. 3A (Count II).  The section of the statute quoted by the district court reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>Any person whose name, portrait or picture is used within the commonwealth for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without his written consent may bring a civil action in the superior court against the person so using his name, portrait or picture, to prevent and restrain the use thereof....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.Gen.L. ch. 214 Sec. 3A.  The court found that \"[w]hile the plaintiff previously authorized the defendants' use of his picture, it is clear that he does not do so now.\"  Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications), Inc., 886 F.Supp. at 954.   Thus, Donoghue was likely to prevail on Count II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court rejected Defendants-Appellees' affirmative defense that Donoghue had \"unclean hands.\"   Under the precedent of this circuit, a district court has wide discretion in deciding whether to bar recovery based upon a plaintiff's alleged \"unclean hands.\"  K Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 912 (1st Cir.1989) (citing Codex Corp. v. Milgo Elec. Corp., 717 F.2d 622, 633 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 931, 104 S.Ct. 1719, 80 L.Ed.2d 191 (1984)).  Given the record before us, we cannot say that the district court's finding regarding Defendants-Appellees' unclean hands defense was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, there is ample support in the record for a Preliminary Injunction as entered in this case.  Although we have determined that a few of the rulings made by the district court were premature, these rulings, if error either on the merits or because prematurely decided, were only harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Rejection of Other Injunctive Relief</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-Appellant Donoghue has appealed the order of the district court because he had requested a more sweeping preliminary injunction than the one granted.  We conclude, however, that just as there is ample support in the record for the relief ordered in the Preliminary Injunction, so also are there sound reasons for not ordering relief of greater scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donoghue contends that the Defendants-Appellees are not allowed to use his name even in the text of publications and in promotional materials;  his motion for a preliminary injunction requested that the district court so order.  App. at 00072-73.  Donoghue admits, however, that Defendants-Appellees are permitted to use his name in the title of publications as long as they pay him the required 5% royalty.  He also admits that Defendants-Appellees are permitted to use his name in the text of a publication if his name is also in the title of that publication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Donoghue's argument for greater injunctive relief than that granted can be seen as an argument that Defendants-Appellees are not permitted to use his name in the text of a product unless his name appears in the title of that product as well.  And because any use of his name in the title of a publication requires a royalty payment, Donoghue is thus arguing that any authorized use of his name in the text of a publication requires a royalty payment.  The harm, then, that Donoghue is seeking to prevent by his request for a more sweeping preliminary injunction is primarily, if not entirely, delayed receipt of royalty payments--a kind of harm ordinarily redressed by an award of monetary damages.  \"But an entitlement to money damages, without more, rarely constitutes an adequate basis for injunctive relief.\"  CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v.

The district court supportably determined that if an entitlement to money damages accrues during the pendency of this litigation, a monetary award at the conclusion of the case will be an adequate remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons explained in Parts I-III, we conclude that the record before the district court when it ordered the Preliminary Injunction and now before us is insufficient for us to determine whether the four rulings identified in Part III.B were erroneous as a matter of law.  Therefore, we explicitly do not rely on these rulings in reaching our decision.  We also determine, however, for the reasons stated in Part IV, that the order for entry of the Preliminary Injunction on the terms stated was adequately supported by other findings and conclusions of the district court.  That being so, we conclude that the errors of law, if any, in the four rulings identified were harmless in relation to the issues before us in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order for entry of the Preliminary Injunction is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Donoghue (\"Donoghue\"), Plaintiff-Appellant, from a Preliminary Injunction of limited scope.  Donoghue asserts that the district court erred in its interpretation of contract documents executed by the parties and asks this court to expand relief to, or nearer to, the full scope he requested in the district court.  We conclude that if the district court committed any error of law, the error was harmless in relation to the issues before us in this appeal.  Also, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in fashioning the limited scope of the Preliminary Injunction entered.

These conclusions relate to issues that are at least potentially mixed-legal-factual issues that would be more appropriately decided, both in the district court and on appeal, after the parties have had a full opportunity for discovery and development of evidence bearing upon the factual elements of the legal-factual mix.  They are open to de novo consideration in the district court during further proceedings there, as well as on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background Facts</p>\n    <p>A. Before July 1989</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donoghue is an investment adviser well-known as an expert on money markets and mutual funds.  Acting individually and through a number of corporate entities, he has marketed advice for more than twenty years in books, newsletters, columns, on-line services, and public appearances.  One of his business entities was The Donoghue Organization, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation of which Donoghue was the sole stockholder.  Its flagship publication was Donoghue's MoneyLetter--a semi-monthly newsletter introduced by Donoghue in 1980.  In 1986, Donoghue's MoneyLetter was voted \"Best Financial Advisory Newsletter\" by the Newsletter Association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Documents Dated July 28, 1989</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simultaneously, two documents were executed.  Though signed by Donoghue in September 1989, these agreements were made \"as of\" July 28, 1989.  They were called the Stock Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") and the Personal Services and Non-Competition Agreement (\"PSA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Stock Purchase Agreement was signed by Donoghue as sole shareholder of The Donoghue Organization, Inc. and Mary Ann Bonomo as Vice President of IBC USA (Publications), Inc.  (\"IBC USA\").  Under the terms of the SPA, Defendant-Appellant IBC USA purchased all 10,000 shares of Common Stock of The Donoghue Organization, Inc. from Donoghue for $2,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Personal Services and Non-Competition Agreement was also signed by Donoghue and Mary Ann Bonomo.  Under the terms of the PSA, Donoghue became a part-time employee of IBC USA, agreeing to devote approximately one-third of his professional time to editorial, promotional, and other activities mainly involving the MoneyLetter publication.  The initial term of the PSA was set at five years, with one five-year extension available at the option of IBC USA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A central subject of dispute in this litigation is the scope and extent of the right of IBC USA and its new wholly owned subsidiary, IBC/Donoghue, Inc., also a Defendant-Appellee, to use Donoghue's name.  The contractual rights of the Defendants-Appellees are controlled by the SPA and the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A provision of the SPA declares:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>The rights to use the name \"William E. Donoghue\" and variations thereof have always been the property of the Seller [Donoghue], not the Company [The Donoghue Organization, Inc.], and Buyer's [IBC USA's] rights to the use of such name are governed by the Personal Services Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPA cl. 3(m).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSA elaborates on the rights to use the name \"William E.

Donoghue or any variation thereof in any registered or unregistered trademark, to Employee, provided that an agreement for continued use by IBC/USA has not been concluded, but nothing herein shall be deemed to grant any right, title or interest, or any agreement to grant any right, title or interest, to Employee in or to any name or mark (registered or unregistered) or portion thereof not constituting the name William E. Donoghue or a variation thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PSA cl. 11.  The dispute between the parties centers primarily upon the interpretation of this clause and relevant statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>C. Developments Before Amendment of the PSA on July 21, 1994</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the currently alleged deficiencies in the clarity and specificity of the SPA and PSA, and in the performance of each party under these agreements, the first five-year term of the PSA passed relatively uneventfully.  During this term, IBC USA changed the corporate name of The Donoghue Organization, Inc. to IBC/Donoghue, Inc.;   Donoghue contributed articles to Donoghue's MoneyLetter and performed various other duties under terms of the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to clause 2(b) of the PSA, IBC USA was required to give notice to Donoghue one year before the last day of the term of the PSA if IBC USA wished to exercise its option to extend the term of the PSA for an additional five years.  In early July of 1993, before the one-year benchmark of July 28, 1993, IBC USA initiated discussions with Donoghue regarding the possibility of amending the PSA before extending it for the additional five-year term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBC USA proposed to restructure the compensation provisions of the PSA, primarily to eliminate the 5% royalty that would have first begun to accrue when the second five-year term commenced.  In return, IBC USA proposed to increase various incentive payments to Donoghue, based on the number of telephone inquiries generated by his columns, appearances, and books.  The record is unclear about how this proposal, or negotiations relating to it, proceeded or whether any progress was made toward amending the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, on July 16, 1993, IBC USA gave formal notice to Donoghue of its desire to exercise its options under clauses 2(b) and 11 of the PSA to extend, for an additional five years, to July 29, 1999, the term of (1) Donoghue's employment and (2) the license to use his name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>D. Amendment of the PSA on July 21, 1994 and the Failure of Negotiations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negotiations regarding an amendment of the PSA continued as the first five-year term was coming to a close.  On July 21, 1994, just before the end of the initial five-year term of the PSA, the parties executed a modification of the agreement.  This modification extended for one month the time period in which IBC USA could use Donoghue's name without paying the 5% royalty:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>IBC/USA will continue to have the right to use the name William E. Donoghue and variations thereof on or in connection with the existing products of IBC/USA without payment of the stated 5% royalty until August 31, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. at 00062.  In return for this concession, IBC USA allowed Donoghue to send his employees to IBC USA's weekly Donoghue's MoneyLetter Investment Committee meetings during the month of August, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interim provision delaying the time when the 5% royalty payments would begin to accrue was itself modified, with Donoghue's consent.  The commencing date when royalty payments would begin was moved to October 31, 1994.  Negotiations regarding a permanent amendment to the PSA, however, were unsuccessful.  The parties never agreed to any further amendment of the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the final interim extension was about to end in October, 1994, Defendants-Appellees removed Donoghue's surname from Donoghue's MoneyLetter, making the new title simply MoneyLetter.   The name of the corporate subsidiary remained IBC/Donoghue, Inc., however, and MoneyLetter continued to contain references to Donoghue and his name within the text of the newsletter.  For example, one section of the newsletter was devoted to the \"Donoghue Signal,\" a statistical measure of market performance.  Also, MoneyLetter was labeled as \"a service of IBC/Donoghue, Inc.\" on the bottom of the first page.  William E. Donoghue was listed in the masthead as \"Founder &amp; Contributing Editor\" of MoneyLetter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants-Appellees now no longer publish anything with the name \"William E. Donoghue\" appearing in the name of the publication, but they do market publications in which the corporate name IBC/Donoghue is used within the title.  Examples are IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Average, IBC/Donoghue's Mutual Funds Almanac, and IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Directory.   IBC USA has not paid Donoghue any royalties (under either the $1,000-per-year or the 5% provision) since October of 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Other Developments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precipitating event for the current civil action, however, was not the use of Donoghue's name in the name or text of any newsletter or the nonpayment of royalties but rather the use of Donoghue's name and likeness in promotional materials advertising MoneyLetter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1994, IBC USA sent a direct mail advertisement for MoneyLetter to the general investing public and the professional investment community.  The envelope in which this mailing was sent featured a photograph of Donoghue purportedly gesturing at advertisements of five large mutual fund companies.  Above the photograph was a statement in large type and in quotation marks:  \"I'm sick and tired of investors getting ripped-off by ads like these!\"   There were similar statements in smaller type below the photograph and on the back of the envelope as well.  The district court found that Donoghue had neither made nor authorized any of the statements on the envelope.  Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications), Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court found that Donoghue had not authorized this letter.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donoghue received two written complaints regarding the direct mail advertisement--from Berger Associates, Inc. and Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, Inc.  App. at 00304-09.  Moreover, Value Line threatened litigation against Donoghue and has since filed an action in federal court for the Southern District of New York against IBC USA and IBC/Donoghue, Inc. claiming that it has been injured by the \"explicitly false,\" \"deceptive,\" and \"misleading\" statements in the direct mail campaign.  App. at 00319.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Forbes magazine columnist's comment, published under the date April 24, 1995, publicly criticized Donoghue for the statements attributed to him in this MoneyLetter promotional mailing and for continued promotion of the \"Donoghue Signal\" by touting hypothetical results that would have been achieved had an investor used the \"Donoghue Signal\" over a period commencing in 1980, even though the \"Donoghue Signal\" was first introduced in 1988.  The columnist observed that use of such \"back-tested\" results was inconsistent with the published views of Donoghue himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately two weeks after the publication of the Forbes piece, on May 8, 1995, Donoghue commenced this civil action, claiming infringement of the trademark in his name under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125 (Count I);  improper use of his name and photograph in violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 214, Sec. 3A (Count II);  trademark infringement under the common law (Count III);  breach of contract, including the obligation to pay royalties (Count IV);  and violation of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A (Count V).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>II. The District Court Decision of Donoghue's Motion for</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Preliminary Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon counts I and II, Donoghue filed on May 8, 1995, along with his complaint, a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.  Donoghue asked the court to enjoin the Defendants-Appellees from distributing any newsletter, publication or promotional materials:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>upon which the name William E. Donoghue or any variation thereof (including but not limited to \"Donoghue,\" the \"Donoghue Signal,\" \"IBC/Donoghue\" or \"IBC/Donoghue, Inc.\") appears, or upon which any picture of plaintiff William E. Donoghue appears....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. at 00073.  The only ways in which the Defendants-Appellees would have been able to use Donoghue's name under this requested injunction would have been as a by-line for an article actually written by Donoghue or in the masthead of MoneyLetter with the title \"Founder &amp; Contributing Editor.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing on May 10, 1995, the district court entered a temporary restraining order of a more limited scope than Donoghue had requested.  On May 26, 1995, after further briefing by the parties, the district court granted Donoghue's motion for a preliminary injunction.  The Preliminary Injunction fashioned by the district court, however, like the Temporary Restraining Order that preceded it, was significantly narrower in scope than Donoghue had requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of granting a blanket prohibition on the use of Donoghue's name, the district court focused on the alleged harmful actively of the Defendants-Appellees.  As a result, the court required only that the Defendants-Appellees:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>1. refrain from distributing to any customer or potential customer or anyone else any advertising or promotional materials or any other material in which William E.

Introduction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a court looks to the words of a document to consider the meaning of those words in the context of the agreement, the search is for manifested meaning, not a privately held belief or intent of one party, not communicated to other parties to the bargain.  See Rose-Derry Corp. v. Proctor &amp; Schwartz, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span>, 52 (1934).  Moreover, if the parties execute two or more documents, with a manifested intent that the documents together express their entire agreement, a court reads the documents together, rather than construing each as if it stood alone.  FDIC v. Singh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592214\"><a href=\"/opinion/592214/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-pritam-singh/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the initial agreement was expressed in the two documents dated July 28, 1989.  By their own terms they manifest an understanding that together they completely express one integrated agreement.  For example, clause 2 of the SPA reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>Other Agreements.   Simultaneously with the Closing Seller and Buyer shall enter into a Personal Services and Non-Competition Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 2 (the \"Personal Services Agreement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. at 00026.  Also, as previously noted, clause 3(m) of the SPA explicitly states that the rights to use Donoghue's name are governed by the PSA.  Accordingly, we read the two documents together, as we understand the district court to have done as well, when searching for manifested meaning relevant to any existing dispute between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>B. The District Court's Interpretation of the Royalty Provisions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statements of the district court explaining its order for entry of the Preliminary Injunction are subject to being interpreted as including several distinct and potentially significant rulings as a matter of law, all made as part of the court's reasoned decision to grant the Preliminary Injunction in the precise terms fashioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss these rulings separately as well as together.  We have chosen the order in which we discuss them for convenience only;  we explicitly do not imply that this order of consideration is compelled by precedent or logic.  Indeed, we conclude that the several rulings are interrelated in ways that make it appropriate for a court to consider all of them before deciding any.  Our separation of the district court's combined determination into four parts and our designation of those parts as \"First Ruling,\" \"Second Ruling,\" \"Third Ruling,\" and \"Fourth Ruling\" are our formulations made only to facilitate reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the phrasing of these four rulings is ours, not that of the litigants.  We have chosen this phrasing to express what we understand to be the substantive content of the determinations of the district court, explicit and implicit.  Each of the parties to this appeal has chosen somewhat different phrasings, which we find to be ambiguous.  Examples include the contrasting statements of the parties about whether the district court ruled that a use of Donoghue's name was:  (1) permissible without regard to whether the use would result in a royalty obligation, or (2) permissible only on condition that royalties be paid, or (3) permissible only on condition that the user explicitly acknowledge a royalty obligation (without, however, stating the precise conditions that would determine the fact and the amount of the royalty obligation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have chosen this course of stating our reading of the meaning of the district court's rulings, including reasonable inferences about implicit assumptions as well as explicit declarations, because the scope of this court's authority and responsibility is not limited to choosing one or the other of partisan descriptions of the district court's reasoning.  We examine that reasoning from the perspective of impartial appellate review, and not through partisan lenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Ruling.   The district court ruled that the agreement of the parties was unambiguous--not only with respect to the scope and extent of the rights of Defendants-Appellees to use the name of William E. Donoghue but also with respect to the amount of royalties they would have to pay as a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second Ruling.   The district court ruled that the agreement unambiguously meant that Defendants-Appellees were free to remove Donoghue's name from the name of a product and continue to use Donoghue's name within the text of the product and in materials marketing the product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third Ruling.   The district court ruled that the agreement unambiguously meant that, when exercising their rights under the Second Ruling, Defendants-Appellees would incur no obligation to pay any royalties during the second five-year term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth Ruling.   The district court implicitly ruled that the agreement authorized Defendants-Appellees to use Donoghue's name in the corporate title of the wholly-owned subsidiary, IBC/Donoghue, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching the Second and Third rulings, the district court included, as steps of reasoning, the following interpretation of clause 11 of the PSA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Clause] 11 only requires the IBC/USA to pay the plaintiff royalties for use of the plaintiff's name on revenues received \"from the sale ... of products or services including such name in the name thereof.\"  (Emphasis added.)   The plain language of this provision does not require the payment of royalties for use of the plaintiff's name in connection with the defendants' products, as long as the plaintiff's name does not appear in \"the name\" of the products.  The plaintiff's argument that it was his understanding that he was entitled to royalties for all uses of his name does not alter the plain meaning of [clause] 11.  \"As a general principle, a court considers extrinsic evidence to discern intent only when a contract term is ambiguous.\"  Massachusetts Mun.

In the next paragraph of its Memorandum, however, the district court rejected the contention that the July 21, 1994 amendment was inconsistent with the court's reading of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff claims that [clause] 11 was changed by an amendment to the Personal Services Agreement, dated July 21, 1994. That amendment allowed IBC/USA to \"continue to have the right to use the name William E. Donoghue and variations thereof on or in connection with the existing products of IBC/USA without payment of the stated 5% royalty until August 31, 1994.\"   The plaintiff claims that this amendment implies that the 5% royalty was required to be paid on use of the plaintiff's name even if the name did not appear in the title of the defendants' publications.  Otherwise, argues the plaintiff, there would have been no reason to include the phrase \"in connection with the existing products.\"   The court does not agree with the plaintiff's analysis.  The language of the amendment tracks the language of [clause] 11, which permitted IBC/USA to \"use the name William E. Donoghue and variations thereof on or in connection with any and all of the existing products and services of IBC/USA.\"   The amendment's addition, \"without payment of the stated 5% royalty \" clearly refers to the royalty provision of [clause] 11.  Rather than change the circumstances giving rise to the right to receive a royalty, the amendment only forgave the payment of royalties which would otherwise have been due under paragraph 11, i.e., royalties flowing from the sale of products in which the plaintiff's name appears in the name.  IBC/USA's right to use the name as before continued.  The royalty obligation was suspended for the period stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 952 </span>(emphasis in original).  Because IBC USA had removed Donoghue's name from the title of MoneyLetter, the district court concluded that Donoghue was not entitled to any royalties even though his name was being used in the text of MoneyLetter through reference to such things as the \"Donoghue Signal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the district court also concluded that the use of the corporate name IBC/Donoghue in the title of various publications (IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Average, IBC/Donoghue's Mutual Funds Almanac and IBC/Donoghue Money Fund Directory ) was an invalid use of Donoghue's name under the PSA unless royalties were paid.   This \"unless\" clause implies that the district court made what we have designated as its Fourth Ruling--Defendants-Appellees were authorized by the agreement to use Donoghue's name in the corporate title of the wholly-owned subsidiary, IBC/Donoghue, Inc.  Were this not so, the court would have needed to determine the appropriate measure of damages for breach of an obligation not to use Donoghue's name in a corporate title rather than declaring, as it did in the passage quoted immediately below, that Defendants-Appellees could not escape the obligation (or \"requirement\") of paying royalties if they used Donoghue's name in this way and other conditions for a royalty obligation were satisfied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>The fact that the plaintiff's name is now part of the corporate name of the entity that was sold to IBC/USA does not permit the defendants to escape the Personal Services Agreement's requirement of the payment of royalties for use of the plaintiff's name in the title of the defendants' publications.  The plaintiff is thus likely to prevail in establishing that the use of his name in the titles of these publications without the payment of compensation constitutes unauthorized use in contravention of [clause] 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 953.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>C.

In support of this decision, the court cited \"the parol evidence rule\" as described in the following maxim.  \"As a general principle, a court considers extrinsic evidence to discern intent only when a contract term is ambiguous.\"  Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications) <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

An agreement may be ambiguous in one respect and clear in another.  The legal consequences that flow from a determination of ambiguity in one respect do not automatically apply to a dispute over another matter as to which the agreement is clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, a party claiming to benefit from clarity of an agreement in relation to one kind of potential dispute about meaning must show that there is an actual dispute between the parties about the meaning of the agreement as to which the asserted clear provision is relevant.  Clarity about some hypothetical issue not in dispute is irrelevant.  Conversely, a party claiming to benefit from ambiguity (for example, by being allowed to proffer extrinsic evidence supporting its interpretation) must show ambiguity in the meaning of the agreement with respect to the very issue in dispute.  Demonstration of ambiguity in some respect not material to any existing dispute serves no useful purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because ambiguity in relation to some hypothetical dispute that has not arisen as an existing controversy is immaterial, a court's determination regarding any ambiguity that will make a difference in outcome must be made with sensitivity to what are the existing genuine disputes between the parties (real and not merely hypothetical controversies).  Only by having this understanding can a court begin to consider with precision and particularity the alternative meanings proposed by the disputing parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if either or both of the parties proposes that extrinsic evidence should be received and considered by the court or by the finder of facts (the jury in a jury trial or the judge as finder of facts in a nonjury proceeding), concrete proffers of the proposed extrinsic evidence are important aids to the court's performing its function of determining both whether there is a material ambiguity in the language of the agreement and whether, for that reason or for some other reason, extrinsic evidence is admissible and sufficient to present a genuine dispute to be resolved by a finder of facts.  It will sometimes be virtually impossible for a court to determine with confidence whether a contract is ambiguous in a material respect or whether extrinsic evidence should be admitted unless the court first knows what is the proffered extrinsic evidence, and what is the alleged ambiguity it allegedly addresses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although, at first glance, a court's proceeding in this way may seem to subvert the \"general principle\" and the parol evidence rule itself, closer examination discloses that proceeding in this way facilitates decisions consistent with the principle, the rule itself, and their underlying policy foundations.  A key point is that courts consider contentions regarding ambiguity or lack of ambiguity not in the abstract and not in relation to hypothetical disputes that a vivid imagination may conceive but instead in relation to concrete disputes about the meaning of an agreement as applied to an existing controversy.  Often the existing controversy arises from a turn of events that was not foreseen and addressed by the parties in their negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When invoking a standard of materiality of any demonstrated ambiguity and reviewing proffered extrinsic evidence to determine whether that standard of materiality has been met, a court is proceeding in a way compatible both with Massachusetts law and with the views of distinguished commentators on the law of contracts.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has held that \"[a contract] is to be read in the light of the circumstances of its execution, which may enable the court to see that its words are really ambiguous.\"  Robert Indus. v.

The Defendants-Appellees, on the other hand, contended that they were licensed to use Donoghue's name freely in any manner they chose, as part of the official name of the wholly-owned corporate subsidiary as well as in publications.  They also contended that they would incur royalty obligations only if variations of \"William E. Donoghue\" (argued as including only \"William Donoghue, Bill Donoghue, Will Donoghue, Billy Donoghue, etc.\"   App. at 00683) were used in the title of a publication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proffered interpretations of the parties are at polar extremes;  the district court's interpretation, though at neither pole, is closer to Donoghue's proposed interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These possible interpretations do not exhaust the list of plausible possibilities, however.  We add one more to illustrate the point, making clear, however, that we are not making any ruling as to the correct interpretation at this time and do not mean our illustrative suggestion to be given any more or different consideration in further proceedings than that given to other plausible interpretations of the documentary manifestations of the agreement of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possible interpretation we suggest is that Defendants-Appellees were not free to change only the title of a product and nothing more, then continue to use Donoghue's name as before in the text of the product, or packaging, or promotional materials, and thereby escape the royalty obligation they would have had if Donoghue's name had remained in the title.  This possible turn of events was not explicitly addressed in the text of either the SPA or the PSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In thinking about whether there was in the transaction as a whole an implicit answer for each turn of events that has occurred, one may consider what most likely would have happened if a negotiator had explicitly called attention to such a possibility during negotiations.  For example, suppose a negotiator for the parties now designated as Defendants-Appellees had stated during negotiations that they understood the proposed agreement to be that they would no longer have any royalty obligation if they just deleted the Donoghue name from the title of the product and continued to use the Donoghue name within the text of the product and in advertising the product.  Unless one can reasonably say it is likely this statement of an understanding not previously expressed would have been accepted and negotiations would have proceeded unruffled, the reasoning of the district court about what the parties' agreement in this case unambiguously means is unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of even greater moment in relation to the existing controversy between the parties in this case is that a reader of the full text of the two documents executed by the parties might reasonably conclude that the parties had not explicitly addressed another possible turn of events that later did occur--that IBC USA would decide to create a wholly-owned subsidiary and use \"Donoghue\" in its corporate name.  Suppose IBC USA, during negotiations, had openly stated that it would interpret the two documents together, as then drafted, to grant it the right to use \"Donoghue\" in a new corporate entity's name (and to do so without any royalty obligation as long as IBC USA and its subsidiary did not include \"Donoghue\" in the name of a product).  Is it reasonable to believe that such a statement would have been accepted by Donoghue, without incident, so negotiations would then have proceeded unruffled?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that it is more appropriate at this time not to determine whether the agreement is ambiguous in any material respect, not to determine whether or not extrinsic evidence about the manifested meaning may be received, and not to make any final resolution of the dispute between the parties about the manifested meaning of the agreement.  Those matters are better left to decision after the district court has before it proffers of proposed extrinsic evidence that might be admissible and might bear upon the final decision about meaning in some respect that is material to an existing controversy and not merely to some hypothetical dispute.  The district court can then make the decision with the benefit of a precise focus on proffers of extrinsic evidence proposed for admissibility and consideration.  Also, the court will have more assurance that the case is being decided on the merits and in a way consistent with the objectives underlying the parol evidence rule and the general principle regarding use of extrinsic evidence in determining the meaning of an integrated agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our affirmance of the district court's order does not imply approval of the court's reasoning that the PSA is unambiguous and what it means as to the rights of Defendants-Appellees to use Donoghue's name and as to their obligation to pay royalties (previously designated as Ruling One, Ruling Two, Ruling Three, and Ruling Four).  We conclude that the issues regarding the scope of the right to use Donoghue's name and the rights to royalties should not have been decided before the parties had a reasonable opportunity to develop the factual record more fully.  We explicitly do not make any rulings as to the alleged ambiguity of the contract on any material issue or as to whether extrinsic evidence may appropriately be received.  Those decisions must be made, in the first instance, in the district court, after opportunity for the parties to proffer whatever extrinsic evidence they rely upon to support their various contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>IV. Support for the Preliminary Injunction on the Terms Stated</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Conduct Enjoined</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding our determination that some of the conclusions reached by the district court were premature, we affirm the Preliminary Injunction as entered.  We do so because there is ample support elsewhere in the record for the Preliminary Injunction as fashioned by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Preliminary Injunction prevents the Defendants-Appellees from (1) distributing materials in which Donoghue is represented as criticizing a specific person or entity or stating things inconsistent with his published views;  (2) distributing materials with Donoghue's photograph or likeness without his prior written consent;  and (3) using Donoghue's name in the title of a publication unless royalty payments are made.  These prohibitions are not very onerous, and the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the district court, apart from those we have determined to be premature, amply support granting the Preliminary Injunction to the extent allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court found that Donoghue is a nationally known investment advisor who has a reputation as an expert in mutual and money market funds.  As a result, the court concluded that Donoghue's name was worthy of trademark protection under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a).  Specifically citing this court's decision in Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195026\"><a href=\"/opinion/195026/boston-beer-company-v-slesar-bros/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1993), the district court concluded that Donoghue's name had acquired \"secondary meaning.\"   And, because \"[t]he likelihood of confusion in the public's mind occasioned by an unauthorized use of the plaintiff's name by the defendants is clear ... any unauthorized use of the plaintiff's name by the defendants would constitute an infringement of the plaintiff's trademark in his name.\"  Donoghue v.

Thus, Donoghue was likely to prevail on Count I of his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court found that the statements attributed to Donoghue in the December 1994 direct mailing were not consistent with his previous writings and his investment philosophy.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  As there </span>was a specific consistency requirement in Exhibit 12 to the PSA, App. at 00057, such attributed statements were unauthorized.  Thus, the district court concluded that Donoghue was likely to prevail on his breach of contract claim (Count IV).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the district court concluded that Donoghue was likely to prevail on his claim that the Defendants-Appellees used his name and photograph in a manner that violated Mass.Gen.L. ch. 214 Sec. 3A (Count II).  The section of the statute quoted by the district court reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>Any person whose name, portrait or picture is used within the commonwealth for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without his written consent may bring a civil action in the superior court against the person so using his name, portrait or picture, to prevent and restrain the use thereof....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.Gen.L. ch. 214 Sec. 3A.  The court found that \"[w]hile the plaintiff previously authorized the defendants' use of his picture, it is clear that he does not do so now.\"  Donoghue v. IBC/USA (Publications), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Inc.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">954</span></span>.   Thus, Donoghue was likely to prevail on Count II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court rejected Defendants-Appellees' affirmative defense that Donoghue had \"unclean hands.\"   Under the precedent of this circuit, a district court has wide discretion in deciding whether to bar recovery based upon a plaintiff's alleged \"unclean hands.\"  K Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524046\"><a href=\"/opinion/524046/k-mart-corporation-v-oriental-plaza-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 912 (1st Cir.1989) (citing Codex Corp. v. Milgo Elec. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424866\"><a href=\"/opinion/424866/codex-corporation-v-milgo-electronic-corporation-codex-corporation-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 633 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span> </span>(1984)).  Given the record before us, we cannot say that the district court's finding regarding Defendants-Appellees' unclean hands defense was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, there is ample support in the record for a Preliminary Injunction as entered in this case.  Although we have determined that a few of the rulings made by the district court were premature, these rulings, if error either on the merits or because prematurely decided, were only harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Rejection of Other Injunctive Relief</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-Appellant Donoghue has appealed the order of the district court because he had requested a more sweeping preliminary injunction than the one granted.  We conclude, however, that just as there is ample support in the record for the relief ordered in the Preliminary Injunction, so also are there sound reasons for not ordering relief of greater scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donoghue contends that the Defendants-Appellees are not allowed to use his name even in the text of publications and in promotional materials;  his motion for a preliminary injunction requested that the district court so order.  App. at 00072-73.  Donoghue admits, however, that Defendants-Appellees are permitted to use his name in the title of publications as long as they pay him the required 5% royalty.  He also admits that Defendants-Appellees are permitted to use his name in the text of a publication if his name is also in the title of that publication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Donoghue's argument for greater injunctive relief than that granted can be seen as an argument that Defendants-Appellees are not permitted to use his name in the text of a product unless his name appears in the title of that product as well.  And because any use of his name in the title of a publication requires a royalty payment, Donoghue is thus arguing that any authorized use of his name in the text of a publication requires a royalty payment.  The harm, then, that Donoghue is seeking to prevent by his request for a more sweeping preliminary injunction is primarily, if not entirely, delayed receipt of royalty payments--a kind of harm ordinarily redressed by an award of monetary damages.  \"But an entitlement to money damages, without more, rarely constitutes an adequate basis for injunctive relief.\"  CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Properties, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"690274\"><a href=\"/opinion/690274/cmm-cable-rep-inc-dba-creative-media-management-inc-v-ocean-coast/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 622 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court did not make any error of law or clearly erroneous finding of fact, and did not abuse its discretion in determining that Donoghue has not shown that irreparable harm will result from a failure to enter a preliminary injunction as broad as he seeks.  The district court supportably determined that if an entitlement to money damages accrues during the pendency of this litigation, a monetary award at the conclusion of the case will be an adequate remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons explained in Parts I-III, we conclude that the record before the district court when it ordered the Preliminary Injunction and now before us is insufficient for us to determine whether the four rulings identified in Part III.B were erroneous as a matter of law.  Therefore, we explicitly do not rely on these rulings in reaching our decision.  We also determine, however, for the reasons stated in Part IV, that the order for entry of the Preliminary Injunction on the terms stated was adequately supported by other findings and conclusions of the district court.  That being so, we conclude that the errors of law, if any, in the four rulings identified were harmless in relation to the issues before us in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order for entry of the Preliminary Injunction is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
