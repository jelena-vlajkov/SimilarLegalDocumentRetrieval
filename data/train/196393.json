Pro se plaintiff Robert McClary appeals from\r                                   \r\n\nthe  summary dismissal  of his  habeas  corpus petition.   He\r\n\nclaims  that  his  conviction  for  trafficking  cocaine   is\r\n\nunconstitutional  because  the prosecutor  violated  Doyle v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nOhio,  426  U.S.  610 (1976),  by  improperly cross-examining\r                \r\n\nMcClary and  commenting on  McClary's post-arrest  silence in\r\n\nhis closing argument.\r\n\n     We have thoroughly reviewed  the record and the parties'\r\n\nbriefs  on appeal.  We are persuaded that the habeas petition\r\n\nwas properly  dismissed under  Anderson v. Charles,  447 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n404, 408-09  (1981), (per  curiam), and Grieco  v.

The  record  discloses  that  the\r\n\nevidence against McClary was strong and that the  error could\r\n\nnot have  had  a  substantial and  injurious  effect  on  the\r\n\nverdict.  See  Brecht v.  Abrahamson, 113 S.  Ct. 1711,  1722\r                                                \r\n\n(1993).   While  we  need not  decide  whether the  \"harmless\r\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\" test of Chapman v. California, 386\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  18, 24 (1967), should  be applied to  this appeal1, the\r\n\nevidence indicates that any  alleged Doyle error was harmless\r                                                      \r\n\nunder  this test  as well.
