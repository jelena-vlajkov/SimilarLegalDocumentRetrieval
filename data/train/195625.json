(\"HAVED\"),  a  nonprofit organization  which operates  group\n\nhomes for persons infected  with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus\n\n(\"HIV\"),  brought a  civil action  in the United  States District\n\nCourt  for the  District of  Puerto Rico  alleging discriminatory\n\nconduct by defendants-appellees in  violation of the Fair Housing\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C.     3601-3617 (1993) (\"FHA\").  The  district court\n\nruled  that the  principal  defendants, Jorge  Suarez Medina  and\n\nBaudilla  Albelo Suarez (hereinafter:   \"Suarez\"  or \"Suarezes\"),\n\nwere exempt from  liability under the FHA by  virtue of the \"pri-\n\nvate individual owner\" provision which applies to persons who own\n\nless than four \"single-family houses,\" see id.   3603(b)(1).

Upon learning  that HAVED intended to use  the site\n\nas  a group home for persons infected with HIV, defendants Milton\n\nDolittle  and Antonio  Padilla organized  neighborhood opposition\n\nand threatened and  coerced Suarez into  reneging on the  rental-\n\nsale agreement.  HAVED,  along with its directors and  a prospec-\n\ntive resident of the  proposed group home, initiated  the present\n\naction  charging  defendants  Suarez, Dolittle  and  Padilla with\n\nviolations of  FHA     3604 and 3617,  and Suarez with  breach of\n\ncontract under P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit. 31,     3371-3589 (1993).1  \n\nHAVED  demanded  declaratory and  injunctive  relief  as well  as\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages.  \n\n          Suarez  moved  to dismiss  the  complaint  for lack  of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction, citing FHA   3603(b)(1):\n\n     (b)  Nothing in  . .  . [section  3604  of this  title]\n          (other than subsection (c)) shall apply to    \n\n                    \n\n     1Section 3604 of the FHA provides, in pertinent part:  \n\n     [E]xcept as exempted by sections [3603(b) and 3607], it\n     shall be unlawful ---\n\n          (a)  To refuse to sell or rent after making a bona\n                                                            \n               fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the\n                         \n               sale  or  rental of,  or  otherwise make  un-\n                                                            \n               available or deny,  a dwelling to any  person\n                                \n               because of race, color, religion, sex, famil-\n               ial status, or national origin. \n\n42 U.S.C.   3604(a) (emphasis added).  The FHA amendments enacted\nin 1988  extended comparable protection to persons with a \"handi-\ncap,\" see, e.g.,  id.   3604(f), including  persons infected with\n                     \nHIV.

The Suarez Properties\n                          \n\n          At the time of the September 1992 rental-sale agreement\n\nwith HAVED, Suarez owned  four separate parcels of land  on which\n\nwere located five structures.  First, the \"Los Llanos  Property,\"\n                                    \n\nthe subject  of the  abortive rental-sale agreement,  consists of\n\none undivided  lot containing two unattached  residences.  Suarez\n\nholds undisputed title to the entire lot and one residence (House\n\nA) where the Suarezes  once resided.  Their son  built the second\n\nhouse on  the lot (House  B) as a  residence for his  own family.\n\nHowever, Mr. Suarez, Sr.,  was robbed while residing in  House A,\n\nand  the Suarezes  and their  son moved  away  from Los  Llanos. \n\nHouses A  and B  remained unoccupied  at the  time of  the HAVED-\n\nSuarez rental-sale agreement. \n\n          Second, the \"Guarico Residence,\" located in the Guarico\n                \n\nsection  of Corozal,  was designed  as a  two-story house  with a\n\nseparately  equipped,  single-family  apartment  on  each  floor.\n\nSuarez held title  to the lot and the house.   At the time of the\n\nrental-sale  agreement, the  Suarezes  resided  primarily in  the\n\nsecond-floor apartment, and the son and his family resided in the\n\nfirst-floor apartment.  Due to his physical impairments, however,\n\nMr. Suarez, Sr., sometimes lived \"interchangeably\" with his son's\n\nfamily in the  first-floor apartment.   The district court  ruled\n\nthat the Guarico Residence constituted one single-family house. \n\n          Third,  the \"Guarico  Rental\" is  a two-story,  single-\n               \n\nfamily  structure located  near the  Guarico Residence  but  on a\n\n                                5\n\nseparate lot.  At  the time of the rental-sale  agreement, Suarez\n\nheld title  to the house  and the  lot, and the  house was  being\n\nrented to a single family. \n\n          The fourth  real estate parcel, the  \"La Aldea Rental,\"\n                    \n\nis a single lot  in the La  Aldea section containing a  one-story\n\nstructure which Suarez purchased  in April 1991, and rented  to a\n\nsingle family (Apartment 1).  Prior to the rental-sale agreement,\n\nhowever,  Suarez renovated the  basement of  the building  into a\n\nseparate apartment  (Apartment 2), and  it was rented  to another\n\ntenant.\n\nB.   The District Court Proceedings\n                                   \n\n          Following  an evidentiary  hearing, the  district court\n\ndismissed the  HAVED complaint for lack of \"subject matter juris-\n\ndiction,\" citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6).    Pursuant to\n\nProvisos 1 and 3 of FHA   3603(b)(1), the court ruled that at the\n\ntime of the  rental-sale agreement with HAVED  in September 1992,\n\nSuarez  had a bona fide ownership interest in only three \"single-\n                                                        \n\nfamily houses\" (hereinafter:   \"SFH\" or \"SFHs\"):  (i) the Guarico\n\nRental, (ii) the  La Aldea Rental (Apartment 1), and (iii) the La\n\nAldea Rental (Apartment 2).2    \n\n                    \n\n     2The  district  court also  found,  under Proviso  4  and 42\nU.S.C.   3603(c), that Suarez did not qualify as a \"person in the\nbusiness of  selling or renting  dwellings,\" id., because  he had\n                                                \nnot  participated  in  more  than two  real  estate  transactions\nbetween  September 1991 and September 1992.   Because Suarez must\nsatisfy  all four provisos in order to qualify for the   3603(b)-\n(1) exemption, we need not reach this issue. \n\n                                6\n\n          Thus, the district  court explicitly declined  to treat\n\nthree abodes as  SFHs.  First,  the court ruled that  the Guarico\n\nResidence is not a  SFH under FHA   3603(b)(1) because  only SFHs\n\nthat  are \"sold  or rented\"  can be  counted toward  the four-SFH\n\nthreshold.  In other words, in the district court's view a defen-\n\ndant's  current residence is not counted as an SFH under Provisos\n                         \n\n1 and 3 unless  it is the subject of the sale  or rental transac-\n\ntion  giving rise to the cause of action  under the FHA, or it is\n                                                           \n\n\"on the market\"  at the time of the challenged  transaction.  See\n                                                                 \n\nHogar Agua  y Vida en el  Desierto, Inc. v. Suarez,  829 F. Supp.\n                                                  \n\n19, 22  (D.P.R. 1993) (citing Lamb  v. Sallee, 417  F. Supp. 282,\n                                             \n\n285 (E.D. Ky. 1976)).  Second, since Suarez, Sr., had been forced\n\nto vacate  House A at the Los  Llanos Property after the robbery,\n\nand to acquire the Guarico Residence, the district court conclud-\n\ned that it would be \"inequitable\" to treat House A as a SFH under\n\neither Proviso 1 or  3.  Id. at 22-23.   Finally, relying on  the\n                            \n\nsame equitable grounds noted in relation to House A, the district\n\ncourt ruled that House B on the Los Llanos Property should not be\n\ntreated  as a  SFH.   The court ruled,  in the  alternative, that\n\nHouse B  should not be  treated as  a SFH because  the Suarezes's\n\nson,  who  constructed House  B, was  its  bona fide  owner under\n                                                    \n\nPuerto Rico law; whereas the Suarezes simply held an  unexercised\n\n\"right  of accession\"  based on  their ownership  of the  land on\n\nwhich House B  is situated.

HAVED argues  that\n\nnothing in FHA   3603(b)(1) excludes \"owner-occupied\" houses from\n\nthe  term  \"single-family  house.\"    Furthermore,  HAVED  notes,\n\nProviso 2 explicitly  qualifies the term  SFH (\"any such  single-\n\nfamily house by a  private individual owner not residing  in such\n                                                                 \n\nhouse at the  time of such sale\"), a qualification  that would be\n     \n\nentirely  unnecessary if  the term  \"SFH\" itself  excluded owner-\n                                                                 \n\noccupied houses.   \n        \n\n          On the other  hand, Suarez says that  the Guarico Resi-\n\ndence  is  excluded from  consideration  under Provisos  1  and 3\n\nbecause the prefatory clause  in FHA   3603(b)(1) (exempting \"any\n\nsingle-family  house sold  or  rented by  the  [defendant]\" in  a\n                                     \n\ndiscriminatory manner) suggests that Congress did not intend that\n\nany property of the defendant count toward the four-SFH threshold\n\nunless that property  itself was up for sale or  rent at the time\n                                                     \n\n                    \n\nF.3d  247, 256 (1st Cir.  1993).  Nonetheless,  the latter rubric\nprovides no basis  for extending an FHA  exemption by withholding\n                                \nfrom  HAVED all  relief against  Suarez's alleged  discriminatory\n                       \nrefusal to  sell or rent the Los Llanos Property.  Moreover, even\nif the court were permitted to withhold injunctive relief, Suarez\nwould be answerable  for legal damages (actual  and punitive) for\n                                      \nany FHA violation.  See  42 U.S.C.   3613(c).  More  importantly,\n                       \nhowever,  Suarez  could  have asserted  no  cognizable  equitable\ndefense  in light of the fact that his misfortunes while residing\n       \nin Los Llanos were in no sense attributable to HAVED. \n\n                                13\n\nof  the  allegedly discriminatory  transaction.6   Suarez  argues\n\nthat this  must be so because the  references to \"such [SFHs]\" in\n                                                      \n\nProvisos 1 and  3 can only relate  back to the  prefatory clause,\n\nand incorporate  the requirement that only \"sold  or rented\" SFHs\n\nare  to be included in calculating the four-SFH threshold.  Thus,\n\nSuarez  says,  a  defendant's  residence normally  would  not  be\n\nincluded as a SFH unless it were on the market at the time of the\n\nalleged  discriminatory sale  or  rental.   Suarez discounts  the\n\nvalue  of  Proviso 2  as a  tool  for interpreting  the prefatory\n\nclause   in  FHA     3603(b)(1),  since   Proviso  2   creates  a\n\nconsiderably \"narrower\" and altogether independent exemption that\n\nallows  one discriminatory sale (but  not a rental)  of an owner-\n                                                                 \n\noccupied  SFH to be excluded within any two-year period.  Proviso\n        \n\n1,  on the other hand,  creates a \"broader  exemption\" for owners\n\nwho own no  more than three SFHs that are either for sale or rent\n                                                                 \n\nby the owner.7\n\n                    \n\n     6As  with his  other concessions, see  supra note  4, Suarez\n                                                 \nstipulates that the Guarico Residence would qualify as a \"single-\nfamily house\" in all respects, but for its status as his current,\n                                      \noff-market residence.  We  take no position respecting  the basis\nfor Suarez's  stipulation, but  confine our consideration  to the\ntwo issues briefed by the parties. \n\n     7Alternatively, Suarez argues that the Guarico Residence  is\nexcluded  under  the so-called  \"Mrs.  Murphy\"  exemption in  FHA\n  3603(b)(2), which exempts \"rooms or units in dwellings contain-\ning living quarters  occupied or  intended to be  occupied by  no\nmore than  four families living  independently of each  other, if\n                                                                 \nthe  owner  actually maintains  and occupies  one of  such living\n                                                                 \nquarters  as his  residence.\"   42 U.S.C.    3603(b)(2) (emphasis\n                           \nadded).    The \"Mrs.  Murphy\"  exemption  is totally  inapposite,\nhowever.   It provides an  exemption from section 3604 liability.\n                                                                \n\n                                14\n\n          The present  dispute prompts two inquiries.   The first\n\nis whether a  defendant's current residence is excluded  from the\n                                                       \n\nthreshold four-SFH calculus under Provisos 1 and 3 simply because\n\nit is his  primary or  current residence, even  though all  other\n\nSFHs owned but not occupied by the defendant are included without\n                                                         \n\nregard  to whether they were  concurrently \"on the  market.\"  The\n\nsecond  inquiry is  whether Congress  meant to  exclude  from the\n\nthreshold  four-SFH  calculus all  SFHs  owned  by the  defendant\n\n(including the primary residence)  not on the market at  the time\n\nthe defendant    for discriminatory reasons    refused to sell or\n\nrent a  different SFH to the  plaintiff.  We turn  to these ques-\n\ntions. \n\n     1.   Exclusion for Residence Qua Residence\n                                               \n\n          As its  prefatory clause  makes clear, the  FHA   3603-\n\n(b)(1) exemption     assuming its four provisos are  satisfied   \n\napplies  to any \"single-family house sold or rented by the owner\"\n           \n\nin  a discriminatory  manner.   For section  3603(b)(1) purposes,\n\ntherefore, the relevant  SFHs in this  case are Houses  A and  B,\n\nlocated on the Los Llanos Property Suarez refused to rent or sell\n\nto HAVED.  Section 3603(b)(1) neither defines the term \"SFH,\" nor\n\n                    \n\nIt does not exclude a structure from the Proviso 1 and 3 analyses\n                               \nunder FHA   3603(b)(1).   See id.   3604(b)  (\"nothing in section\n                                 \n[3604] . . .  shall apply to  . . .  rooms and units  . . .  .\").\nThus,  the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption could  have relevance only if,\nfor example, Suarez had refused  to sell or rent one unit  in the\n                                                                 \nGuarico Residence to HAVED.\n                 \n\n                                15\n\ndoes  its  prefatory clause  expressly  limit the  term  \"SFH\" to\n\nstructures in which  the defendant does not reside.   Conversely,\n\nas  Suarez acknowledges, if the  Suarezes had refused  to rent or\n\nsell their Guarico Residence to HAVED, the prefatory clause would\n                                                           \n\nnot have debarred  the Suarezes from a  section 3603(b)(1) exemp-\n\ntion merely because the  property being rented or sold  was their\n\nresidence. \n\n          The statutory  context in  which  the prefatory  clause\n\nappears undermines the Suarez contention as well.  See Skidgel v.\n                                                              \n\nMaine Dep't  of Human Servs.,  994 F.2d 930, 937  (1st Cir. 1993)\n                            \n\n(meaning of  particular statutory  language assessed in  light of\n\nentire  statute).  The four FHA   3603(b)(1) provisos do not give\n\nrise  to four  independent  exemptions, as  Suarez suggests,  but\n\nrepresent four  cumulative preconditions to  the single exemption\n                                                       \n\nset out in  the prefatory clause.  If any of the four provisos is\n\nnot satisfied, no section 3603(b)(1) exemption is appropriate. \n\n          Proviso 2  refers specifically to a  discrete subset of\n\nthe  \"discriminatory\"  SFH  sales  focused upon  in  the  section\n\n3603(b)(1) prefatory clause, namely,  sales of SFHs in  which the\n\ndefendant is not residing.  If  the unqualified term \"SFH\" in the\n                         \n\nprefatory  clause were intended to embrace only SFHs in which the\n\ndefendant is not residing, no such further qualification would be\n\nneeded in  Proviso 2.  See Mosquera-Perez v. INS, 3 F.3d 553, 556\n                                                \n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (court  should avoid interpretations which render\n\nany part of  statute meaningless).  Thus,  if the term  \"SFH,\" as\n\n                                16\n\nused  in  the prefatory  clause, applies  to residences  and non-\n                                                            \n\nresidences, the pendent references to \"such [SFHs]\" in Provisos 1\n\nand 3 also necessarily encompass the Suarezes's Guarico Residence\n\nqua residence. \n   \n\n          Finally, the legislative history discloses no basis for\n\nsecond-guessing the \"plain language\"  of section 3603(b)(1).  See\n                                                                 \n\nLaracuente v.

As\n\ninitially introduced in Congress,  the FHA contained few signifi-\n\ncant exemptions from liability, see, e.g., supra note 7 (describ-\n                                                \n\ning  \"Mrs.  Murphy\" exemption),  and  the  breadth of  the  FHA's\n\ncoverage caused  vigorous Senate opposition.   See generally Jean\n                                                            \n\nE.

Dirksen\n    \n\nproposed to assuage  opposition by exempting sales and rentals of\n\n\"any single-family house sold  or rented by an owner  residing in\n\nsuch house  at the time  of such sale or  rental, or who  was the\n\nmost recent resident of such house prior to such sale or rental.\"\n\nSee 114  Cong. Rec. 4571 (1968).   Yet even the  \"Dirksen substi-\n   \n\ntute,\"  later modified and enacted  as Proviso 2,  failed to gain\n\nenough  Senate support.  To break the deadlock, Senator Robert C.\n\nByrd proposed the expanded four-part exemption, later codified as\n\npresent section  3603(b)(1).   During floor debate,  Senator Byrd\n\noffered two illuminating hypotheticals  to demonstrate the cover-\n\n                                17\n\nage which would be provided under his proposal, but not under the\n\nDirksen substitute:\n\n          A  widow owns  and lives  in a  single-family\n                                      \n          dwelling.    She  also  owns  a single-family\n          dwelling across the street, the tenant there-\n          in being her daughter.  The daughter moves to\n          another  State. The widow  cannot qualify for\n          exemption  under  the Dirksen  substitute be-\n          cause she neither resides in the house across\n          the  street    of  which she is  the owner   \n          nor  is the  \"most  recent resident\"  of such\n          dwelling prior to a  subsequent sale or rent-\n          al.\n\n          An individual lives  in his own single-family\n                                 \n          dwelling located on a three-quarter-acre lot.\n          He  decides to  build a  second house  on the\n          lot.

Other  senators likewise  recognized that  the \"more\n\nthan three\"  threshold would include  houses in which  the seller\n\nresided.  See 114 Cong.

Rec. 5640.  \n     We  note two  sound  reasons for  devaluing this  statement.\nFirst,  as noted,  see supra  p. 19, inconsistent  expressions of\n                                                 \nsponsor intent are  insufficient to override the  plain import of\nthe statutory language.   Second, Senator Byrd's more generalized\nstatements  concerning a  rough numerical  symmetry in  statutory\nconstruction  were preceded by his detailed recitation of the two\n                           \nfact-specific hypotheticals discussed above.  See supra p. 18.\n                                                       \n\n                                19\n\n          Suarez  proposes to exclude the Guarico Residence under\n\nProvisos 1 and  3 because it was neither for rent nor sale at the\n\ntime he  refused to sell the  Los Llanos Property to  HAVED.  See\n                                                                 \n\nLamb  v. Sallee,  417 F.  Supp. 282,  285 (E.D.  Ky. 1976).   The\n               \n\ntheory is that the term  \"such [SFHs]\" in Provisos 1 and  3 unam-\n                              \n\nbiguously relates  back to the complete  phrase    \"single-family\n\nhouse  sold or rented  by an owner\"     in the section 3603(b)(1)\n                     \n\nprefatory clause.  The language of the statute is not dispositive\n\non  this issue, and the  interpretation proposed by  Suarez is at\n\nleast plausible.  \n\n          Although it  is conceivable  that Congress's  choice of\n\nthe indeterminate  modifier \"such\"  was intended only  to require\n\nthe  counting of residences qua residences under Provisos 1 and 3\n                               \n\n   in direct contrast to the  more constricted scope of the  term\n\n\"SFH\" under  Proviso 2      Provisos 1 and 3  reasonably might be\n\nread to impose the additional, distinct requirement that any SFH,\n\nregardless whether it is  the defendant's \"residence,\" be counted\n\nunder Provisos 1 and 3 only  if it is a \"single-family house sold\n                                                                 \n\nor  rented by an owner.\"   Indeed, Congress's  choice of words   \n                      \n\n\"sold or rented\"    in the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause is\n\na most curious usage.  In order for liability to attach under FHA\n\n  3604, a defendant need never have consummated the discriminato-\n                                               \n\nry rental  or sale  of the  SFH to  which the  section 3603(b)(1)\n\nprefatory clause adverts.  Rather, FHA liability attaches as soon\n\nas  the defendant \"refuses to  sell or rent  after [the plaintiff\n\n                                20\n\nmakes] a  bona fide offer,\" see  supra note 1, without  regard to\n                                      \n\nwhether the SFH is ever \"sold\" or \"rented\" to anyone.  With these\n                                                    \n\nlinguistic difficulties in  mind, it seems arguable  at least, in\n\nkeeping  with the structure and language of the statute, that the\n\nterm \"such,\"  as used in Provisos  1 and 3, imports  the same \"on\n\nthe market\"  qualification  necessarily implicit  in the  section\n\n3603(b)(1) prefatory clause.\n\n          As noted earlier, however, normally latent ambiguity in\n\na statutory  modifier like \"such\" should be construed in further-\n\nance  of the statute's remedial  goals.  See  Cia. Petrolera, 754\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at 428.  (\"When Congress uses broad generalized language in\n\na  remedial statute,  and  that language  is  not contravened  by\n\nauthoritative  legislative history, a  court should interpret the\n\nprovision generously  so as to effectuate  the important congres-\n\nsional  goals.\")   Not  only does  the authoritative  legislative\n\nhistory  not  contravene  the  HAVED  interpretation,  see  supra\n                                                                 \n\nSection  II.B.1,  it contradicts  the  Suarez  contention.   Most\n\nimportantly,  neither  hypothetical   advanced  by  Senator  Byrd\n\nassumed  or  intimated that  the seller's  residence was  \"on the\n\nmarket\" at the time  the discriminatory sale of the  second house\n\ntook  place, yet  Senator  Byrd included  both  these SFHs  under\n\nProvisos  1  and 3.

Upon learning that HAVED intended to use the site as a group home for persons infected with HIV, defendants Milton Dolittle and Antonio Padilla organized neighborhood opposition and threatened and coerced Suarez into reneging on the rental-sale agreement.  HAVED, along with its directors and a prospective resident of the proposed group home, initiated the present action charging defendants Suarez, Dolittle and Padilla with violations of FHA Secs. 3604 and 3617, and Suarez with breach of contract under P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Secs. 3371-3589 (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  HAVED demanded declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suarez moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Nothing in ...

The Suarez Properties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the September 1992 rental-sale agreement with HAVED, Suarez owned four separate parcels of land on which were located five structures.  First, the \"Los Llanos Property,\" the subject of the abortive rental-sale agreement, consists of one undivided lot containing two unattached residences.  Suarez holds undisputed title to the entire lot and one residence (House A) where the Suarezes once resided.  Their son built the second house on the lot (House B) as a residence for his own family.  However, Mr. Suarez, Sr., was robbed while residing in House A, and the Suarezes and their son moved away from Los Llanos.  Houses A and B remained unoccupied at the time of the HAVED-Suarez rental-sale agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the \"Guarico Residence,\" located in the Guarico section of Corozal, was designed as a two-story house with a separately equipped, single-family apartment on each floor.  Suarez held title to the lot and the house.  At the time of the rental-sale agreement, the Suarezes resided primarily in the second-floor apartment, and the son and his family resided in the first-floor apartment.  Due to his physical impairments, however, Mr. Suarez, Sr., sometimes lived \"interchangeably\" with his son's family in the first-floor apartment.  The district court ruled that the Guarico Residence constituted one single-family house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the \"Guarico Rental\" is a two-story, single-family structure located near the Guarico Residence but on a separate lot.  At the time of the rental-sale agreement, Suarez held title to the house and the lot, and the house was being rented to a single family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth real estate parcel, the \"La Aldea Rental,\" is a single lot in the La Aldea section containing a one-story structure which Suarez purchased in April 1991, and rented to a single family (Apartment 1).  Prior to the rental-sale agreement, however, Suarez renovated the basement of the building into a separate apartment (Apartment 2), and it was rented to another tenant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court dismissed the HAVED complaint for lack of \"subject matter jurisdiction,\" citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (6).  Pursuant to Provisos 1 and 3 of FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1), the court ruled that at the time of the rental-sale agreement with HAVED in September 1992, Suarez had a bona fide ownership interest in only three \"single-family houses\" (hereinafter:  \"SFH\" or \"SFHs\"):  (i) the Guarico Rental, (ii) the La Aldea Rental (Apartment 1), and (iii) the La Aldea Rental (Apartment 2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court explicitly declined to treat three abodes as SFHs.  First, the court ruled that the Guarico Residence is not a SFH under FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) because only SFHs that are \"sold or rented\" can be counted toward the four-SFH threshold.  In other words, in the district court's view a defendant's current residence is not counted as an SFH under Provisos 1 and 3 unless it is the subject of the sale or rental transaction giving rise to the cause of action under the FHA, or it is \"on the market\" at the time of the challenged transaction.  See Hogar Agua y Vida en el Desierto, Inc. v. Suarez, 829 F.Supp. 19, 22 (D.P.R.1993) (citing Lamb v. Sallee, 417 F.Supp. 282, 285 (E.D.Ky.1976)).  Second, since Suarez, Sr., had been forced to vacate House A at the Los Llanos Property after the robbery, and to acquire the Guarico Residence, the district court concluded that it would be \"inequitable\" to treat House A as a SFH under either Proviso 1 or 3.  Id. at 22-23.   Finally, relying on the same equitable grounds noted in relation to House A, the district court ruled that House B on the Los Llanos Property should not be treated as a SFH.  The court ruled, in the alternative, that House B should not be treated as a SFH because the Suarezes's son, who constructed House B, was its bona fide owner under Puerto Rico law;  whereas the Suarezes simply held an unexercised \"right of accession\" based on their ownership of the land on which House B is situated.  Id. at 23 (citing Castro Anguita v. Figueroa, 103 P.R.Dec. 847, 850-51, 3 Official Translations 1188-89 (1975)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the only dispute on appeal concerns the legal sufficiency of undisputed jurisdictional facts, we review the Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal de novo.  See Heno v. FDIC, 20 F.3d 1204, 1205 (1st Cir.1994).  We conclude, as a matter of law, that the Suarezes's claim to exemption is precluded by the FHA.  See FDIC v. Keating, 12 F.3d 314, 316 (1st Cir.1993) (statutory interpretations reviewed de novo ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We employ traditional tools of statutory interpretation, particularly the presumption that ambiguous language in a remedial statute is entitled to a generous construction consistent with its reformative mission.  See, e.g., Cia.  Petrolera Caribe, Inc. v. Arco Caribbean, Inc., 754 F.2d 404, 428-29 (1st Cir.1985) (noting that this canon of construction represents an \"especially reliable and legitimate\" indicator of congressional intent);  see generally 3 Norman J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction Sec. 60.01 (5th ed. 1992) [hereinafter Sutherland ].  This presumption has been relied on consistently by the courts in interpreting the omnibus remedial provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prominently include the Fair Housing Act itself.  See Casa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court of Puerto Rico, 988 F.2d 252, 257 n. 6 (1st Cir.1993) (citing Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 211-12, 93 S.Ct. 364, 367-68, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972));  see also City of Edmonds v. Washington State Bldg. Code Council, 18 F.3d 802, 804 (9th Cir.1994).  An important corollary for present purposes is that ambiguous exemptions from FHA liability are to be narrowly construed.  See, e.g., id.;  Elliott v. City of Athens, Georgia, 960 F.2d 975, 978-79 (11th Cir.) cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 376, 121 L.Ed.2d 287 (1992);  United States v. Columbus Country Club, 915 F.2d 877, 882-83 (3d Cir.1990) (collecting cases), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1205, 111 S.Ct. 2797, 115 L.Ed.2d 971 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this appellate perspective we consider which Suarez properties were \"single-family houses\" within the meaning of Provisos 1 and 3 of FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1).  The parties agree that two properties--the Guarico Rental and the La Aldea Rental--qualify as \"single-family houses\" within the meaning of the exemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, given the four-SFH limen established in section 3603(b)(1), the FHA exemption cannot stand if the Suarezes were bona fide \"owners\" of two SFHs in addition to the Guarico Rental and the La Aldea Rental.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Los Llanos Property, House A</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, HAVED argues that the district court exceeded its authority by fashioning an \"equitable\" exception which resulted in the exclusion of Los Llanos, House A, from the four-SFH calculus on the ground that the Suarezes had been forced to vacate the Los Llanos area due to neighborhood crime.  See In re Shoreline Concrete Co., 831 F.2d 903, 905 (9th Cir.1987) (\"Courts of equity are bound to follow express statutory commands to the same extent as are courts of law.\")  (citing Hedges v. Dixon County, 150 U.S. 182, 192, 14 S.Ct. 71, 74, 37 L.Ed. 1044 (1893)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although courts have on occasion engrafted equitable exceptions where rigid adherence to literal legislative language clearly would disserve legislative intent, see, e.g., Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, 455 U.S. 385, 398, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 1135, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982) (equitable tolling of filing deadlines), generally courts are loath \"to announce equitable exceptions to legislative requirements or prohibitions that are unqualified by the statutory text.\"  Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat'l Pension Fund, 493 U.S. 365, 376, 110 S.Ct. 680, 687, 107 L.Ed.2d 782 (1990) (emphasis added).  Moreover, \"[w]here Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of contrary legislative intent.\"  Andrus v. Glover Constr.  Co., 446 U.S. 608, 616-17, 100 S.Ct. 1905, 1910, 64 L.Ed.2d 548 (1980) (emphasis added).  Further, exemptions from the requirements of a remedial statute--like the FHA--are to be construed narrowly to limit exemption eligibility.  See Badaracco v. Commissioner, 464 U.S. 386, 398, 104 S.Ct. 756, 764, 78 L.Ed.2d 549 (1984) (rejecting taxpayer plea for \"nonliteral reading\" of tax statute \"on grounds of equity to the repentant taxpayer,\" and noting that, faced with a statute \"which must receive a strict construction,\" \"[c]ourts are not authorized to rewrite [the] statute because they might deem its effects susceptible of improvement.\");  supra p. 181.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we decline to endorse the equitable exception adopted by the district court, especially since Congress elected not to do so when it undertook to narrow FHA liability in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 3603(b).  Nothing in section 3603(b), nor in its legislative history, manifests a congressional intent to temper either the inflexible four-SFH formula or the categorical \"ownership\" standard.  Thus, we believe these FHA provisions reflect the sort of \"considered congressional policy choice\" that elevates the \"effectuation of certain broad social policies ... over the desire to do equity between particular parties.\"  Guidry, 493 U.S. at 376, 110 S.Ct. at 687.  Guidry cautions against creating equitable exceptions to comprehensive remedial statutes in an effort to protect individual defendants from occasional inequities, even inequities attributable to misfeasance by the plaintiffs.  Id. (holding that the district court had no equitable power to contravene ERISA's unqualified anti-garnishment provision by imposing a constructive trust upon pension benefits payable to a former union official who embezzled union funds).  The Guidry admonition holds even stronger sway where, as here, defendant-Suarez's misfortunes were in no sense due to HAVED's conduct.  The Court recognized in Guidry that any attempt to calibrate the precise point at which an individual defendant's vicissitudes are so \" 'especially ' inequitable\" as to outweigh the broad prophylactic policies underlying the congressional decision to protect the plaintiff class would immerse the courts in an inappropriate and \"impracticab[le]\" task.  Id. (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Guarico Residence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HAVED next contends that the district court committed reversible error in not treating the Guarico Residence as a SFH under Provisos 1 and 3 of FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1).  HAVED argues that nothing in FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) excludes \"owner-occupied\" houses from the term \"single-family house.\"   Furthermore, HAVED notes, Proviso 2 explicitly qualifies the term SFH (\"any such single-family house by a private individual owner not residing in such house at the time of such sale\"), a qualification that would be entirely unnecessary if the term \"SFH\" itself excluded owner-occupied houses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, Suarez says that the Guarico Residence is excluded from consideration under Provisos 1 and 3 because the prefatory clause in FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) (exempting \"any single-family house sold or rented by the [defendant]\" in a discriminatory manner) suggests that Congress did not intend that any property of the defendant count toward the four-SFH threshold unless that property itself was up for sale or rent at the time of the allegedly discriminatory transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Suarez argues that this must be so because the references to \"such [SFHs]\" in Provisos 1 and 3 can only relate back to the prefatory clause, and incorporate the requirement that only \"sold or rented\" SFHs are to be included in calculating the four-SFH threshold.  Thus, Suarez says, a defendant's residence normally would not be included as a SFH unless it were on the market at the time of the alleged discriminatory sale or rental.  Suarez discounts the value of Proviso 2 as a tool for interpreting the prefatory clause in FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1), since Proviso 2 creates a considerably \"narrower\" and altogether independent exemption that allows one discriminatory sale (but not a rental) of an owner-occupied SFH to be excluded within any two-year period.  Proviso 1, on the other hand, creates a \"broader exemption\" for owners who own no more than three SFHs that are either for sale or rent by the owner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present dispute prompts two inquiries.  The first is whether a defendant's current residence is excluded from the threshold four-SFH calculus under Provisos 1 and 3 simply because it is his primary or current residence, even though all other SFHs owned but not occupied by the defendant are included without regard to whether they were concurrently \"on the market.\"   The second inquiry is whether Congress meant to exclude from the threshold four-SFH calculus all SFHs owned by the defendant (including the primary residence) not on the market at the time the defendant--for discriminatory reasons--refused to sell or rent a different SFH to the plaintiff.  We turn to these questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Exclusion for Residence Qua Residence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its prefatory clause makes clear, the FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) exemption--assuming its four provisos are satisfied--applies to any \"single-family house sold or rented by the owner\" in a discriminatory manner.  For section 3603(b)(1) purposes, therefore, the relevant SFHs in this case are Houses A and B, located on the Los Llanos Property Suarez refused to rent or sell to HAVED.  Section 3603(b)(1) neither defines the term \"SFH,\" nor does its prefatory clause expressly limit the term \"SFH\" to structures in which the defendant does not reside.  Conversely, as Suarez acknowledges, if the Suarezes had refused to rent or sell their Guarico Residence to HAVED, the prefatory clause would not have debarred the Suarezes from a section 3603(b)(1) exemption merely because the property being rented or sold was their residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory context in which the prefatory clause appears undermines the Suarez contention as well.  See Skidgel v. Maine Dep't of Human Servs., 994 F.2d 930, 937 (1st Cir.1993) (meaning of particular statutory language assessed in light of entire statute).  The four FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) provisos do not give rise to four independent exemptions, as Suarez suggests, but represent four cumulative preconditions to the single exemption set out in the prefatory clause.  If any of the four provisos is not satisfied, no section 3603(b)(1) exemption is appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proviso 2 refers specifically to a discrete subset of the \"discriminatory\" SFH sales focused upon in the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause, namely, sales of SFHs in which the defendant is not residing.   If the unqualified term \"SFH\" in the prefatory clause were intended to embrace only SFHs in which the defendant is not residing, no such further qualification would be needed in Proviso 2.  See Mosquera-Perez v. INS, 3 F.3d 553, 556 (1st Cir.1993) (court should avoid interpretations which render any part of statute meaningless).  Thus, if the term \"SFH,\" as used in the prefatory clause, applies to residences and nonresidences, the pendent references to \"such [SFHs]\" in Provisos 1 and 3 also necessarily encompass the Suarezes's Guarico Residence qua residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the legislative history discloses no basis for second-guessing the \"plain language\" of section 3603(b)(1).  See Laracuente v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 891 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir.1989) (\"Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, the plain language of the statute is conclusive.\").  As initially introduced in Congress, the FHA contained few significant exemptions from liability, see, e.g., supra note 7 (describing \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption), and the breadth of the FHA's coverage caused vigorous Senate opposition.  See generally Jean E. Dubofsky, Fair Housing:  A Legislative History and a Perspective, 8 Washburn L.J. 149 (1969).  Senator Everett M. Dirksen proposed to assuage opposition by exempting sales and rentals of \"any single-family house sold or rented by an owner residing in such house at the time of such sale or rental, or who was the most recent resident of such house prior to such sale or rental.\"   See 114 Cong.Rec. 4571 (1968).  Yet even the \"Dirksen substitute,\" later modified and enacted as Proviso 2, failed to gain enough Senate support.  To break the deadlock, Senator Robert C. Byrd proposed the expanded four-part exemption, later codified as present section 3603(b)(1).  During floor debate, Senator Byrd offered two illuminating hypotheticals to demonstrate the coverage which would be provided under his proposal, but not under the Dirksen substitute:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>A widow owns and lives in a single-family dwelling.  She also owns a single-family dwelling across the street, the tenant therein being her daughter.  The daughter moves to another State.  The widow cannot qualify for exemption under the Dirksen substitute because she neither resides in the house across the street--of which she is the owner--nor is the \"most recent resident\" of such dwelling prior to a subsequent sale or rental.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>An individual lives in his own single-family dwelling located on a three-quarter-acre lot.  He decides to build a second house on the lot.  Ten years later misfortune forces him to parcel the lot and sell the house thereon.   He does not qualify under the Dirksen substitute exemption because he is neither \"residing in\" the adjacent dwelling nor was he the \"most recent resident\" thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">114 Cong.Rec. 5640 (1968) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asked why \"it was necessary to raise the number of houses owned by one party to three,\" Senator Byrd referred to these two hypotheticals, and noted that he had \"already discussed situations in which there would be at least two [single-family] houses involved.\"   Id. (emphasis added).  Significantly, both hypotheticals assumed that the houses in which the seller currently resided would be counted toward the four-SFH threshold in Provisos 1 and 3.  See Rice v. Rehner, 463 U.S. 713, 728, 103 S.Ct. 3291, 3300, 77 L.Ed.2d 961 (1983) (noting that interpretation of statute by sponsor is \" 'authoritative guide to the statute's construction' \") (citation omitted);  see also Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U.S. 253, 263, 106 S.Ct. 1834, 1840, 90 L.Ed.2d 248 (1986) (sponsor's statements credited if consistent with statutory language).  Other senators likewise recognized that the \"more than three\" threshold would include houses in which the seller resided.  See 114 Cong.Rec. 5641 (1968) (\"I know we have people who have a summer home or a winter home....  One could easily have three homes.\")  (statement of Senator Jordan).  Since this legislative history, at the very least, precludes our finding \"a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,\" Laracuente, 891 F.2d at 23, we must conclude that a defendant's residence, qua residence, is not to be excluded under Provisos 1 and 3 of section 3603(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Exemption for \"Off Market\" SFHs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suarez proposes to exclude the Guarico Residence under Provisos 1 and 3 because it was neither for rent nor sale at the time he refused to sell the Los Llanos Property to HAVED.  See Lamb v. Sallee, 417 F.Supp. 282, 285 (E.D.Ky.1976).  The theory is that the term \"such [SFHs]\" in Provisos 1 and 3 unambiguously relates back to the complete phrase--\"single-family house sold or rented by an owner\"--in the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause.  The language of the statute is not dispositive on this issue, and the interpretation proposed by Suarez is at least plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is conceivable that Congress's choice of the indeterminate modifier \"such\" was intended only to require the counting of residences qua residences under Provisos 1 and 3--in direct contrast to the more constricted scope of the term \"SFH\" under Proviso 2--Provisos 1 and 3 reasonably might be read to impose the additional, distinct requirement that any SFH, regardless whether it is the defendant's \"residence,\" be counted under Provisos 1 and 3 only if it is a \"single-family house sold or rented by an owner.\"   Indeed, Congress's choice of words--\"sold or rented\"--in the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause is a most curious usage.  In order for liability to attach under FHA Sec. 3604, a defendant need never have consummated the discriminatory rental or sale of the SFH to which the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause adverts.  Rather, FHA liability attaches as soon as the defendant \"refuses to sell or rent after [the plaintiff makes] a bona fide offer,\" see supra note 1, without regard to whether the SFH is ever \"sold\" or \"rented\" to anyone.   With these linguistic difficulties in mind, it seems arguable at least, in keeping with the structure and language of the statute, that the term \"such,\" as used in Provisos 1 and 3, imports the same \"on the market\" qualification necessarily implicit in the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, however, normally latent ambiguity in a statutory modifier like \"such\" should be construed in furtherance of the statute's remedial goals.  See Cia.  Petrolera, 754 F.2d at 428.  (\"When Congress uses broad generalized language in a remedial statute, and that language is not contravened by authoritative legislative history, a court should interpret the provision generously so as to effectuate the important congressional goals.\")   Not only does the authoritative legislative history not contravene the HAVED interpretation, see supra Section II.B.1, it contradicts the Suarez contention.  Most importantly, neither hypothetical advanced by Senator Byrd assumed or intimated that the seller's residence was \"on the market\" at the time the discriminatory sale of the second house took place, yet Senator Byrd included both these SFHs under Provisos 1 and 3.  Notwithstanding a conceivable vestige of literal ambiguity, therefore, we are persuaded to the view that the Guarico Residence must be included in the four-SFH calculus under section 3603(b)(1) consistent with the FHA's legislative history and its broad remedial design.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time HAVED was denied the opportunity to acquire the Los Llanos Property, allegedly on discriminatory grounds, Suarez held an undisputed ownership interest in \"more than three\" \"single-family houses\":  the Guarico Rental, the La Aldea Rental, the Los Llanos Property, House A, and the Guarico Residence.  Since Suarez cannot satisfy either Proviso 1 or Proviso 3, the alleged discriminatory refusal to proceed with the HAVED rental-sale agreement relating to the Los Llanos Property did not qualify for exemption under FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is vacated.

The burden of proving entitlement to an FHA exemption rested with Suarez.  See Massaro v.

Gendason, 545 F.2d 1224, 1226 (9th Cir.1976) (FHA);  see also 2A Sutherland Sec. 47.11, at 165 (general rule of construction).  Whatever its legal elements, entitlement to an FHA exemption turns on highly fact-dependent inquiries (e.g., the structural design or usage of each dwelling), such that Suarez is bound to these stipulations for purposes of the present litigation.  Cf. Railway Co. v. Ramsey, 89 U.S.  (22 Wall.) 322, 327, 22 L.Ed. 823 (1874) (\"Consent of parties cannot give the courts of the United States [subject matter] jurisdiction, but the parties may admit the existence of facts which show jurisdiction, and the courts may act judicially upon such an admission.\").  By the same token, no precedential significance should be ascribed to our acceptance of these stipulations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The cases Suarez cites in support of the equitable exception fashioned by the district court, see, e.g., FTC v. Security Rare Coin &amp; Bullion Corp., 931 F.2d 1312, 1314 (8th Cir.1991), concerned the equitable remedies a district court may impose after a defendant has been found in violation of a statutory prohibition.  For example, if the statute empowers the court to restrain violations, and neither expressly nor \"by a necessary and inescapable inference [ ] restricts the court's jurisdiction in equity,\" Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 1089, 90 L.Ed. 1332 (1946), the court could utilize all its traditional equitable powers or even desist from extending any equitable relief to the plaintiff where the equities warrant.  See Williams v. Jones, 11 F.3d 247, 256 (1st Cir.1993).  Nonetheless, the latter rubric provides no basis for extending an FHA exemption by withholding from HAVED all relief against Suarez's alleged discriminatory refusal to sell or rent the Los Llanos Property.  Moreover, even if the court were permitted to withhold injunctive relief, Suarez would be answerable for legal damages (actual and punitive) for any FHA violation.  See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 3613(c).  More importantly, however, Suarez could have asserted no cognizable equitable defense in light of the fact that his misfortunes while residing in Los Llanos were in no sense attributable to HAVED</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> As with his other concessions, see supra note 4, Suarez stipulates that the Guarico Residence would qualify as a \"single-family house\" in all respects, but for its status as his current, off-market residence.  We take no position respecting the basis for Suarez's stipulation, but confine our consideration to the two issues briefed by the parties</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Alternatively, Suarez argues that the Guarico Residence is excluded under the so-called \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption in FHA Sec. 3603(b)(2), which exempts \"rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his residence.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 3603(b)(2) (emphasis added).  The \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption is totally inapposite, however.  It provides an exemption from section 3604 liability.   It does not exclude a structure from the Proviso 1 and 3 analyses under FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1).  See id. Sec. 3604(b) (\"nothing in section [3604] ... shall apply to ... rooms and units....\").  Thus, the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption could have relevance only if, for example, Suarez had refused to sell or rent one unit in the Guarico Residence to HAVED</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The legislative history contains a reference arguably supportive of the Suarez interpretation of Provisos 1 and 3.  Senator Byrd suggested that he chose \"three\" as the threshold figure under Provisos 1 and 3 to match the \"Mrs. Murphy exemption,\" see supra note 7, which provides an exemption to a resident landlord of multi-family quarters (containing not more than four family quarters) who refuses to rent any family quarters in the building.  Senator Byrd noted that \"Mrs. Murphy\" must live in one of the four family quarters, so as to confine the \"protective reach\" of the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption \"to three units other than the one in which she lives.   In my amendment, therefore, I use 'three' as the number, in order to have parallel construction.\"   114 Cong.Rec. 5640</p>\n        <p>We note two sound reasons for devaluing this statement.  First, as noted, see supra p. 185, inconsistent expressions of sponsor intent are insufficient to override the plain import of the statutory language.  Second, Senator Byrd's more generalized statements concerning a rough numerical symmetry in statutory construction were preceded by his detailed recitation of the two fact-specific hypotheticals discussed above.

First, the \"Los Llanos Property,\" the subject of the abortive rental-sale agreement, consists of one undivided lot containing two unattached residences.  Suarez holds undisputed title to the entire lot and one residence (House A) where the Suarezes once resided.  Their son built the second house on the lot (House B) as a residence for his own family.  However, Mr. Suarez, Sr., was robbed while residing in House A, and the Suarezes and their son moved away from Los Llanos.

Suarez held title to the lot and the house.  At the time of the rental-sale agreement, the Suarezes resided primarily in the second-floor apartment, and the son and his family resided in the first-floor apartment.  Due to his physical impairments, however, Mr. Suarez, Sr., sometimes lived \"interchangeably\" with his son's family in the first-floor apartment.

The District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court dismissed the HAVED complaint for lack of \"subject matter jurisdiction,\" citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (6).  Pursuant to Provisos 1 and 3 of FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1), the court ruled that at the time of the rental-sale agreement with HAVED in September 1992, Suarez had a bona fide ownership interest in only three \"single-family houses\" (hereinafter:  \"SFH\" or \"SFHs\"):  (i) the Guarico Rental, (ii) the La Aldea Rental (Apartment 1), and (iii) the La Aldea Rental (Apartment 2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court explicitly declined to treat three abodes as SFHs.  First, the court ruled that the Guarico Residence is not a SFH under FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) because only SFHs that are \"sold or rented\" can be counted toward the four-SFH threshold.  In other words, in the district court's view a defendant's current residence is not counted as an SFH under Provisos 1 and 3 unless it is the subject of the sale or rental transaction giving rise to the cause of action under the FHA, or it is \"on the market\" at the time of the challenged transaction.

Second, since Suarez, Sr., had been forced to vacate House A at the Los Llanos Property after the robbery, and to acquire the Guarico Residence, the district court concluded that it would be \"inequitable\" to treat House A as a SFH under either Proviso 1 or 3.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1455301\"><a href=\"/opinion/1455301/lamb-v-sallee/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 22-23. </a></span>  Finally, relying on the same equitable grounds noted in relation to House A, the district court ruled that House B on the Los Llanos Property should not be treated as a SFH.  The court ruled, in the alternative, that House B should not be treated as a SFH because the Suarezes's son, who constructed House B, was its bona fide owner under Puerto Rico law;  whereas the Suarezes simply held an unexercised \"right of accession\" based on their ownership of the land on which House B is situated.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1455301\"><a href=\"/opinion/1455301/lamb-v-sallee/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 23 </a></span>(citing Castro Anguita v.

The Court recognized in Guidry that any attempt to calibrate the precise point at which an individual defendant's vicissitudes are so \" 'especially ' inequitable\" as to outweigh the broad prophylactic policies underlying the congressional decision to protect the plaintiff class would immerse the courts in an inappropriate and \"impracticab[le]\" task.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112353\"><a href=\"/opinion/112353/guidry-v-sheet-metal-workers-nat-pension-fund/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added).</a></span><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Guarico Residence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HAVED next contends that the district court committed reversible error in not treating the Guarico Residence as a SFH under Provisos 1 and 3 of FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1).  HAVED argues that nothing in FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) excludes \"owner-occupied\" houses from the term \"single-family house.\"   Furthermore, HAVED notes, Proviso 2 explicitly qualifies the term SFH (\"any such single-family house by a private individual owner not residing in such house at the time of such sale\"), a qualification that would be entirely unnecessary if the term \"SFH\" itself excluded owner-occupied houses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, Suarez says that the Guarico Residence is excluded from consideration under Provisos 1 and 3 because the prefatory clause in FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) (exempting \"any single-family house sold or rented by the [defendant]\" in a discriminatory manner) suggests that Congress did not intend that any property of the defendant count toward the four-SFH threshold unless that property itself was up for sale or rent at the time of the allegedly discriminatory transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Suarez argues that this must be so because the references to \"such [SFHs]\" in Provisos 1 and 3 can only relate back to the prefatory clause, and incorporate the requirement that only \"sold or rented\" SFHs are to be included in calculating the four-SFH threshold.  Thus, Suarez says, a defendant's residence normally would not be included as a SFH unless it were on the market at the time of the alleged discriminatory sale or rental.  Suarez discounts the value of Proviso 2 as a tool for interpreting the prefatory clause in FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1), since Proviso 2 creates a considerably \"narrower\" and altogether independent exemption that allows one discriminatory sale (but not a rental) of an owner-occupied SFH to be excluded within any two-year period.  Proviso 1, on the other hand, creates a \"broader exemption\" for owners who own no more than three SFHs that are either for sale or rent by the owner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present dispute prompts two inquiries.  The first is whether a defendant's current residence is excluded from the threshold four-SFH calculus under Provisos 1 and 3 simply because it is his primary or current residence, even though all other SFHs owned but not occupied by the defendant are included without regard to whether they were concurrently \"on the market.\"   The second inquiry is whether Congress meant to exclude from the threshold four-SFH calculus all SFHs owned by the defendant (including the primary residence) not on the market at the time the defendant--for discriminatory reasons--refused to sell or rent a different SFH to the plaintiff.  We turn to these questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Exclusion for Residence Qua Residence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its prefatory clause makes clear, the FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) exemption--assuming its four provisos are satisfied--applies to any \"single-family house sold or rented by the owner\" in a discriminatory manner.  For section 3603(b)(1) purposes, therefore, the relevant SFHs in this case are Houses A and B, located on the Los Llanos Property Suarez refused to rent or sell to HAVED.  Section 3603(b)(1) neither defines the term \"SFH,\" nor does its prefatory clause expressly limit the term \"SFH\" to structures in which the defendant does not reside.  Conversely, as Suarez acknowledges, if the Suarezes had refused to rent or sell their Guarico Residence to HAVED, the prefatory clause would not have debarred the Suarezes from a section 3603(b)(1) exemption merely because the property being rented or sold was their residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory context in which the prefatory clause appears undermines the Suarez contention as well.  See Skidgel v. Maine Dep't of Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608080\"><a href=\"/opinion/608080/jenna-skidgel-v-maine-department-of-human-services-v-louis-w-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></a></span>, 937 (1st Cir.1993) (meaning of particular statutory language assessed in light of entire statute).  The four FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1) provisos do not give rise to four independent exemptions, as Suarez suggests, but represent four cumulative preconditions to the single exemption set out in the prefatory clause.  If any of the four provisos is not satisfied, no section 3603(b)(1) exemption is appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proviso 2 refers specifically to a discrete subset of the \"discriminatory\" SFH sales focused upon in the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause, namely, sales of SFHs in which the defendant is not residing.   If the unqualified term \"SFH\" in the prefatory clause were intended to embrace only SFHs in which the defendant is not residing, no such further qualification would be needed in Proviso 2.  See Mosquera-Perez v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194914\"><a href=\"/opinion/194914/mosquera-perez-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 556 (1st Cir.1993) (court should avoid interpretations which render any part of statute meaningless).  Thus, if the term \"SFH,\" as used in the prefatory clause, applies to residences and nonresidences, the pendent references to \"such [SFHs]\" in Provisos 1 and 3 also necessarily encompass the Suarezes's Guarico Residence qua residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the legislative history discloses no basis for second-guessing the \"plain language\" of section 3603(b)(1).  See Laracuente v. Chase Manhattan Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533001\"><a href=\"/opinion/533001/elviraida-laracuente-v-the-chase-manhattan-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1989) (\"Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, the plain language of the statute is conclusive.\").  As initially introduced in Congress, the FHA contained few significant exemptions from liability, see, e.g., supra note 7 (describing \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption), and the breadth of the FHA's coverage caused vigorous Senate opposition.  See generally Jean E. Dubofsky, Fair Housing:  A Legislative History and a Perspective, 8 Washburn L.J. 149 (1969).  Senator Everett M. Dirksen proposed to assuage opposition by exempting sales and rentals of \"any single-family house sold or rented by an owner residing in such house at the time of such sale or rental, or who was the most recent resident of such house prior to such sale or rental.\"   See 114 Cong.Rec. 4571 (1968).  Yet even the \"Dirksen substitute,\" later modified and enacted as Proviso 2, failed to gain enough Senate support.  To break the deadlock, Senator Robert C. Byrd proposed the expanded four-part exemption, later codified as present section 3603(b)(1).  During floor debate, Senator Byrd offered two illuminating hypotheticals to demonstrate the coverage which would be provided under his proposal, but not under the Dirksen substitute:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>A widow owns and lives in a single-family dwelling.  She also owns a single-family dwelling across the street, the tenant therein being her daughter.  The daughter moves to another State.  The widow cannot qualify for exemption under the Dirksen substitute because she neither resides in the house across the street--of which she is the owner--nor is the \"most recent resident\" of such dwelling prior to a subsequent sale or rental.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>An individual lives in his own single-family dwelling located on a three-quarter-acre lot.  He decides to build a second house on the lot.  Ten years later misfortune forces him to parcel the lot and sell the house thereon.   He does not qualify under the Dirksen substitute exemption because he is neither \"residing in\" the adjacent dwelling nor was he the \"most recent resident\" thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">114 Cong.Rec. 5640 (1968) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asked why \"it was necessary to raise the number of houses owned by one party to three,\" Senator Byrd referred to these two hypotheticals, and noted that he had \"already discussed situations in which there would be at least two [single-family] houses involved.\"   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112353\"><a href=\"/opinion/112353/guidry-v-sheet-metal-workers-nat-pension-fund/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added). </a></span> Significantly, both hypotheticals assumed that the houses in which the seller currently resided would be counted toward the four-SFH threshold in Provisos 1 and 3.

Other senators likewise recognized that the \"more than three\" threshold would include houses in which the seller resided.  See 114 Cong.Rec. 5641 (1968) (\"I know we have people who have a summer home or a winter home....  One could easily have three homes.\")  (statement of Senator Jordan).  Since this legislative history, at the very least, precludes our finding \"a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533001\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Laracuente,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/533001/elviraida-laracuente-v-the-chase-manhattan-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, we must conclude that a defendant's residence, qua residence, is not to be excluded under Provisos 1 and 3 of section 3603(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Exemption for \"Off Market\" SFHs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suarez proposes to exclude the Guarico Residence under Provisos 1 and 3 because it was neither for rent nor sale at the time he refused to sell the Los Llanos Property to HAVED.  See Lamb v. Sallee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1455301\"><a href=\"/opinion/1455301/lamb-v-sallee/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span>, 285 (E.D.Ky.1976).  The theory is that the term \"such [SFHs]\" in Provisos 1 and 3 unambiguously relates back to the complete phrase--\"single-family house sold or rented by an owner\"--in the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause.  The language of the statute is not dispositive on this issue, and the interpretation proposed by Suarez is at least plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is conceivable that Congress's choice of the indeterminate modifier \"such\" was intended only to require the counting of residences qua residences under Provisos 1 and 3--in direct contrast to the more constricted scope of the term \"SFH\" under Proviso 2--Provisos 1 and 3 reasonably might be read to impose the additional, distinct requirement that any SFH, regardless whether it is the defendant's \"residence,\" be counted under Provisos 1 and 3 only if it is a \"single-family house sold or rented by an owner.\"   Indeed, Congress's choice of words--\"sold or rented\"--in the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause is a most curious usage.  In order for liability to attach under FHA Sec. 3604, a defendant need never have consummated the discriminatory rental or sale of the SFH to which the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause adverts.  Rather, FHA liability attaches as soon as the defendant \"refuses to sell or rent after [the plaintiff makes] a bona fide offer,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span>note 1, without regard to whether the SFH is ever \"sold\" or \"rented\" to anyone.   With these linguistic difficulties in mind, it seems arguable at least, in keeping with the structure and language of the statute, that the term \"such,\" as used in Provisos 1 and 3, imports the same \"on the market\" qualification necessarily implicit in the section 3603(b)(1) prefatory clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, however, normally latent ambiguity in a statutory modifier like \"such\" should be construed in furtherance of the statute's remedial goals.  See Cia.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"447837\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Petrolera,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/447837/cia-petrolera-caribe-inc-v-arco-caribbean-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">754</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span>.  (\"When Congress uses broad generalized language in a remedial statute, and that language is not contravened by authoritative legislative history, a court should interpret the provision generously so as to effectuate the important congressional goals.\")   Not only does the authoritative legislative history not contravene the HAVED interpretation, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span>Section II.B.1, it contradicts the Suarez contention.  Most importantly, neither hypothetical advanced by Senator Byrd assumed or intimated that the seller's residence was \"on the market\" at the time the discriminatory sale of the second house took place, yet Senator Byrd included both these SFHs under Provisos 1 and 3.  Notwithstanding a conceivable vestige of literal ambiguity, therefore, we are persuaded to the view that the Guarico Residence must be included in the four-SFH calculus under section 3603(b)(1) consistent with the FHA's legislative history and its broad remedial design.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time HAVED was denied the opportunity to acquire the Los Llanos Property, allegedly on discriminatory grounds, Suarez held an undisputed ownership interest in \"more than three\" \"single-family houses\":  the Guarico Rental, the La Aldea Rental, the Los Llanos Property, House A, and the Guarico Residence.  Since Suarez cannot satisfy either Proviso 1 or Proviso 3, the alleged discriminatory refusal to proceed with the HAVED rental-sale agreement relating to the Los Llanos Property did not qualify for exemption under FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is vacated.

Whatever its legal elements, entitlement to an FHA exemption turns on highly fact-dependent inquiries (e.g., the structural design or usage of each dwelling), such that Suarez is bound to these stipulations for purposes of the present litigation.

For example, if the statute empowers the court to restrain violations, and neither expressly nor \"by a necessary and inescapable inference [ ] restricts the court's jurisdiction in equity,\" Porter v.

See Williams v.

Nonetheless, the latter rubric provides no basis for extending an FHA exemption by withholding from HAVED all relief against Suarez's alleged discriminatory refusal to sell or rent the Los Llanos Property.  Moreover, even if the court were permitted to withhold injunctive relief, Suarez would be answerable for legal damages (actual and punitive) for any FHA violation.  See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 3613(c).  More importantly, however, Suarez could have asserted no cognizable equitable defense in light of the fact that his misfortunes while residing in Los Llanos were in no sense attributable to HAVED</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> As with his other concessions, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span>note 4, Suarez stipulates that the Guarico Residence would qualify as a \"single-family house\" in all respects, but for its status as his current, off-market residence.  We take no position respecting the basis for Suarez's stipulation, but confine our consideration to the two issues briefed by the parties</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Alternatively, Suarez argues that the Guarico Residence is excluded under the so-called \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption in FHA Sec. 3603(b)(2), which exempts \"rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his residence.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 3603(b)(2) (emphasis added).  The \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption is totally inapposite, however.  It provides an exemption from section 3604 liability.   It does not exclude a structure from the Proviso 1 and 3 analyses under FHA Sec. 3603(b)(1).  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Sec. 3604(b) </span>(\"nothing in section [3604] ... shall apply to ... rooms and units....\").  Thus, the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption could have relevance only if, for example, Suarez had refused to sell or rent one unit in the Guarico Residence to HAVED</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The legislative history contains a reference arguably supportive of the Suarez interpretation of Provisos 1 and 3.  Senator Byrd suggested that he chose \"three\" as the threshold figure under Provisos 1 and 3 to match the \"Mrs. Murphy exemption,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span>note 7, which provides an exemption to a resident landlord of multi-family quarters (containing not more than four family quarters) who refuses to rent any family quarters in the building.  Senator Byrd noted that \"Mrs. Murphy\" must live in one of the four family quarters, so as to confine the \"protective reach\" of the \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption \"to three units other than the one in which she lives.   In my amendment, therefore, I use 'three' as the number, in order to have parallel construction.\"   114 Cong.Rec. 5640</p>\n        <p>We note two sound reasons for devaluing this statement.  First, as noted, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span>p. 185, inconsistent expressions of sponsor intent are insufficient to override the plain import of the statutory language.  Second, Senator Byrd's more generalized statements concerning a rough numerical symmetry in statutory construction were preceded by his detailed recitation of the two fact-specific hypotheticals discussed above.
