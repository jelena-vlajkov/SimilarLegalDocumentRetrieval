Factual Background.\n                                           \n\n     Charles  Sullivan   (plaintiff  or Sullivan)  is the  former\n\nowner  and sole stockholder of SMC, which owned the stadium where\n\nthe New England Patriots  play their games.  His  father, William\n\nSullivan, was the Patriots' owner at all relevant times.\n\n     In 1987, William Sullivan  sought to sell a 49%  interest in\n\nthe Patriots to an investment banking firm not in the business of\n\nfootball, which, in  turn, was to sell the shares  to the public.\n\nThrough  this transaction,  plaintiff, through  SMC, expected  to\n\nobtain financing for his stadium.  \n\n     Under the terms of the  NFL Constitution and By-Laws, member\n\nteams  are  not permitted  to sell  shares  to the  public unless\n\nthree-fourths  of  the members  approve.    William Sullivan  was\n\nunable to persuade  the other  NFL owners to  allow his  proposed\n\ndeal, and in October 1988, he  instead sold the team to a private\n\nbuyer.   In February  1988, SMC  filed a  Chapter 11  petition in\n\nbankruptcy,  and  the  stadium  subsequently  was  sold  for  the\n\n\"bargain basement price\" of $25 million. \n\n     In May 1991,  William Sullivan sued  the NFL, alleging  that\n\nits  policy  against   public  ownership  violated   the  federal\n\nantitrust  laws  because  it  unreasonably  restrained  trade  in\n\nownership  interests in NFL teams.3   Charles Sullivan filed this\n\nlawsuit  several months later  against the NFL  and other parties\n\n                    \n\n3On  October  22,  1993,  a  jury awarded  William  Sullivan  $38\nmillion, which was reduced  by the district court upon  motion by\nthe  defendants  to  $17  million,  before  trebling.    The  NFL\ndefendants have appealed this verdict.  \n\n                               -3-\n\nallegedly  responsible for  enforcing  the challenged  rule.   He\n\nclaims  that, had  the public  offering of  Patriots' stock  been\n\npermitted, SMC would have received a $40 million dollar loan from\n\nthe  investment banking firm that would have been used to pay off\n\ndebts and to  make significant  renovations to the  stadium.   In\n\naddition, in 1987,  the stadium  held a lease  with the  Patriots\n\nwhich extended until 2002, which Sullivan alleges would have been\n\nextended for  20 years had  the sale  of the Patriots  stock gone\n\nthrough.    Finally, he  claims,  the  NFL policy  prevented  the\n\nPatriots from  making their own investment in  the maintenance of\n\nthe stadium, thus undermining SMC's  ability to keep the Patriots\n\nfrom  breaking  their  lease  with  SMC  and  moving  to  another\n\nlocation.4   \n\n     As  damages, plaintiff  claims  the amount  of the  enhanced\n\nmarket value of  the stadium  that would have  resulted from  the\n\nplanned renovations and the lease extension.\n\n                    \n\n4During   the  bankruptcy  proceedings,   plaintiff  received  an\nassignment  of all SMC's causes of action in consideration of the\nrelease of claims against SMC by plaintiff.  \n     The  NFL  argues  that   Sullivan,  as  SMC's  assignee,  is\nprecluded  from pursuing  its  antitrust claims  against the  NFL\ndefendants  because SMC did not disclose  these claims during the\ncourse  of the  bankruptcy proceedings.    They contend  that, at\nleast by October, 1990,  when he entered into a  stipulation with\nthe  bankruptcy  trustee resolving  claims  by  and against  him,\nSullivan  was fully  aware of  all  of the  facts upon  which his\ncomplaint is based and that his antitrust claims should have been\nraised  in the  bankruptcy proceedings.   In  their view,  SMC is\ntherefore estopped  from bringing a  legal action to  enforce the\nclaims against the NFL defendants.\n     For  the  purposes  of  this decision,  we  assume,  without\ndeciding, that SMC is  not estopped from bringing a  legal action\nto enforce these claims. \n\n                               -4-\n\n     The district court granted  summary judgment for defendants,\n\nholding  that  Sullivan lacked  antitrust  standing.   The  court\n\nreached  this  conclusion  by  determining   that  the  materials\n\nsubmitted indisputably showed that the injury  plaintiff suffered\n\nwas  not within the type contemplated by the antitrust laws; that\n\nits  impact was too indirect;  and that the  damages claimed were\n\ntoo speculative.  Plaintiff now appeals.  \n\n     Our  review  of a  grant  of  summary  judgment is  plenary.\n\nMendes v. Medtronic, Inc., 18 F.3d 13, 15 (1st Cir. 1994). \n                         \n\n          II.  General Principles of Antitrust Standing\n                                                       \n\n     Sullivan asserts that under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15\n\nU.S.C.   15(a) (1994),  he has standing both individually  and on\n\nbehalf of SMC  to maintain  a private damage  action against  the\n\nNFL.   Under Section 4, \"[A]ny person who shall be injured in his\n\nbusiness  or property  by  reason of  anything  forbidden in  the\n\nantitrust  laws may  sue therefor  in any  district court  of the\n\nUnited States in the  district in which the defendant  resides or\n\nis found . . . without  respect to the amount in controversy, and\n\nshall  recover threefold  the damages by  him sustained,  and the\n\ncost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\"5  \n\n     This statutory  language is  broad, conferring the  right to\n\nsue on \"any  person\" claiming  an injury causally  related to  an\n\n                    \n\n5It is  unquestioned that the requirements  of antitrust standing\nexceed  those  of  standing  in  a  constitutional  sense.

The two most\ncommonly stated tests focused  on the \"directness of the  injury\"\nto the alleged  antitrust violation, and whether  a plaintiff was\nin the \"target area\" of the antitrust conspiracy.

He contends that  he has satisfied the\n\nremaining factors, and  that the  court should  have granted  him\n\nstanding  to press his  antitrust suit, both  individually and on\n\nbehalf of SMC.\n\n     We  agree  that  the  district court  correctly  found  that\n\nSullivan's  complaint  met   three  of  the   Associated  General\n                                                                 \n\nContractors factors.  Sullivan  alleged, and presented  evidence,\n           \n\nof  a causal connection between  the application of  the NFL Rule\n\nand  SMC's inability to refinance the stadium because the sale of\n\nPatriots' stock  to the  public was  prohibited.   Sullivan  also\n\nalleged an improper motive on the part of defendants in that they\n\n\"sought  to  restrain  and  monopolize  interstate  commerce   in\n\n                               -8-\n\nprofessional  football\"   and  took  the  actions   they  did  in\n\nfurtherance of that  goal.  In addition,  Sullivan indicated that\n\ndefendants intended  to block the  refinancing of the  stadium by\n\ntheir  actions, or,  at the very  least, that  such a  harm was a\n\nforeseeable  consequence of the  application of  the Rule  to the\n\nPatriots.7   Nor does there  appear to be  a significant  risk of\n\nduplicate  recovery or  danger of  complex apportionment  in this\n\ncase,   as  the   injuries  of   which  Sullivan   complains  are\n\nsufficiently distinct from those alleged by William Sullivan, the\n\nonly other plausible litigant in this case.8\n\nB.  Factors Defeating Standing\n                              \n\n     We are  not persuaded, however, by  Sullivan's argument that\n\nhe   satisfies  the  remaining  Associated  General  Contractors'\n                                                                 \n\nfactors.  The existence  of antitrust injury is a  central factor\n\nin the standing calculus.9   In this case, its  absence, together\n\n                    \n\n7Of course, as  the Supreme Court has  noted, the presence of  an\nimproper motive on the part of the defendants is  not, by itself,\ndeterminative  of  antitrust  standing.   See  Associated General\n                                                                 \nContractors,  519  U.S.  at  537   &amp;  n.37  (noting  that  \"[t]he\n           \navailability of  the    4 remedy  to some  person who claims  its\nbenefit  is  not  a  question  of  the  specific  intent  of  the\nconspirators\") (quoting McCready, 457 U.S. at 479).\n                                \n\n8We  recognize that  there is  a risk  of duplicate  recovery and\ncomplex  apportionment of  damages  as between  Sullivan, in  his\nindividual  capacity,  and  SMC,  in  light  of  their  seemingly\noverlapping  injuries.   We  think  that  this  can  be  avoided,\nhowever,  given  that plaintiff  brings  this  single action  for\ndamages suffered by both.\n\n9Some  courts have  concluded that  a consideration  of antitrust\ninjury is of  threshold significance  in the  Section 4  standing\ninquiry.  See,  e.g., Balaklaw v.  Lovell, 14 F.3d 793,  797-98 &amp;\n                                         \nn.9 (2d Cir. 1994); Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Authority, 921 F.2d\n                                                       \n1438, 1449 (11th  Cir. 1991); see also  State of South  Dakota v.\n                                                              \n\n                               -9-\n\nwith  the  indirectness  of  the  injury  to  Sullivan,  and  the\n\nspeculative  nature   of  the  claimed  damages,   outweighs  the\n\nremaining factors.   We  therefore conclude that  plaintiff lacks\n\nstanding to pursue the claims brought on behalf of SMC.\n\n1.  The Nature of the Injury: Is it Antitrust Injury?\n                                                     \n\n     Sullivan contends that  he has suffered  \"antitrust injury,\"\n\nthat is, the type of injury that the antitrust laws were designed\n\nto prevent.  He relies principally  on McCready, 457 U.S. at 465,\n                                               \n\nand  Los  Angeles Coliseum,  791 F.2d  at  1356, to  support this\n                          \n\nclaim.\n\n     The   Supreme  Court  first   articulated  the   concept  of\n\n\"antitrust injury\"  in Brunswick Corp. v.  Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 429\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 477  (1977).   In Brunswick,  several small bowling  centers\n                                \n\nbrought  suit, challenging  the acquisition  of several  of their\n\ncompetitors  by  the  much  larger Brunswick  Corporation  as  an\n\nanticompetitive merger under  Section 7  of the  Clayton Act,  15\n\nU.S.C.     18, and  seeking treble  damages  under Section  4 for\n\n                    \n\nKansas  City Southern Industries, 880 F.2d 40, 46 (8th Cir. 1989)\n                                \n(noting primacy  of antitrust injury requirement).   Cf. Cargill,\n                                                                 \nInc. v. Montfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 110, n.5 (1986)\n                                  \n(pointing  out, in  the  course of  considering antitrust  injury\nrequirement for  private plaintiffs  seeking an  injunction under\nSection 16 of the Clayton Act, that a showing of antitrust injury\nwas  a  necessary  (though  not  always  sufficient)  element  of\nstanding to sue for damages under Section 4).  \n    We agree  that the absence of antitrust injury weighs heavily\nagainst  a grant  of standing.   We  need not  consider, however,\nwhether  this  should be  fatal  to standing  in  every instance,\nbecause in the circumstances  of this case, we conclude  that the\nbalance of factors as a whole weighs against a grant of standing.\n\n                               -10-\n\nprofits they would have made had the acquired centers gone out of\n\nbusiness.  Id. at 480-81.  \n              \n\n     Although plaintiffs had  alleged that Brunswick had  engaged\n\nin  predatory practices  designed  to lessen  competition in  the\n\nmarkets  it had entered,  they could prove  only that Brunswick's\n\nacquisitions had  deprived them of  profits they would  have made\n\nhad the acquired firms closed.  Id. at 488, 490 &amp; nn.15, 16.  The\n                                   \n\nCourt  noted that,  in essence,  plaintiffs were  not complaining\n\nthat Brunswick's  actions had reduced competition,  but preserved\n\nit,  thereby depriving  plaintiffs of  the benefits  of increased\n\nconcentration.   Id. at 488.  Rejecting the lower court's holding\n                    \n\nthat  any loss  \"causally linked\"  to \"the  mere presence  of the\n\nviolator in the market\" was compensable, id. at 486-87, the Court\n                                            \n\nfound  that  plaintiffs'  injury  was  not  of   \"`the  type  the\n\n[antitrust laws] were intended to forestall,'\" 429 U.S. at 487-88\n\n(citation  omitted).    The Court  held  that  to recover  treble\n\ndamages  under  Section  4,  a plaintiff  must  prove  \"antitrust\n                                                                 \n\ninjury,  which is  to say injury  of the type  the antitrust laws\n\nwere intended to  prevent and  that flows from  that which  makes\n\ndefendants' acts unlawful.\"  Id. at 489 (emphasis in original).\n                                \n\n     In Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465 (1982),\n                                           \n\nthe  first case  explicitly  to address  antitrust standing,  the\n\nCourt incorporated a focus on \"antitrust injury\" into its Section\n\n4 standing inquiry.   The plaintiff in McCready was  a subscriber\n                                               \n\nof  Blue Shield,  a health  insurance plan  that did  not provide\n\nreimbursement   for   psychotherapy    treatment   rendered    by\n\n                               -11-\n\npsychologists  (unless  \"prescribed\"  by  and  billed  through  a\n\nmedical  doctor),  while  providing reimbursement  for  the  same\n\ntreatment if given by a psychiatrist.  McCready  was treated by a\n\npsychologist,  and Blue Shield refused  to reimburse her for this\n\ntreatment.  McCready brought suit, alleging that  Blue Shield and\n\nan  association  of  psychiatrists  had engaged  in  an  unlawful\n\nconspiracy \"`to exclude and  boycott clinical psychologists  from\n\nreceiving compensation  under'\" the  Blue Shield plans,  and that\n\nBlue Shield's  failure to  reimburse was  in furtherance  of this\n\nconspiracy.  McCready, 457 U.S. at 470.\n                     \n\n     The  defendants  argued  that  McCready  had   not  suffered\n\n\"antitrust  injury\" because her injury did  not reflect the anti-\n\ncompetitive effect of  the alleged antitrust  violation.  Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n481-82.  McCready had not paid inflated fees for psychotherapy to\n\npsychiatrists, the supposed beneficiaries  of the conspiracy; nor\n\nhad she alleged  that her psychologists'  bills were higher  than\n\nthey would have been had the conspiracy not existed.  Id. at 481.\n                                                         \n\n     The Court, however, refused to so limit recovery.  While not\n\na competitor of the conspirators, the injury McCready suffered --\n\nsanction in the form  of the unreimbursed psychologists' services\n\n-- \"was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators\n\nsought  to inflict\"  on the  market.   Id.  at 483-84.   McCready\n                                          \n\nsuffered injury by virtue of the role she played in Blue Shield's\n\nanticompetitive scheme.    Denying reimbursement  to patients  of\n\npsychologists was the  \"very means\" by which Blue  Shield coerced\n\n                               -12-\n\nher to choose  between becoming an  unwilling participant in  its\n\nillegal campaign to boycott the  services of psychologists, or to\n\npay the costs of treatment  for the therapist of her choice  from\n\nher own pocket.  The harm to McCready was thus  a \"necessary step\n\nin effecting the ends of the alleged illegal conspiracy.\"  Id. at\n                                                              \n\n479.  The Court therefore found that McCready's injury \"`flow[ed]\n\nfrom  that which  makes  defendants' acts  unlawful,' within  the\n\nmeaning  of  Brunswick,\" falling  \"squarely  within  the area  of\n                      \n\ncongressional concern.\"  Id. at 484.\n                            \n\n     Sullivan  argues that  the  logic of  McCready supports  his\n                                                   \n\nstanding.  In  Sullivan's view,  the NFL rule  at issue  affected\n\ncompetition  in the market for football  stadia by preventing SMC\n\nfrom obtaining refinancing to pay for renovations that would have\n\nled the Patriots to  extend their lease, and by  interfering with\n\nthe Patriots'  capacity to  invest money  in  the maintenance  of\n\ntheir  stadium,  thus  undermining  SMC's  ability  to  keep  the\n\nPatriots from breaking their lease with SMC and moving to another\n\nlocation.     Further,  the  injury  to   SMC  was  \"inextricably\n\nintertwined\"  with that to the owner of the New England Patriots,\n\nsince SMC expected to benefit from a joint proposal to  conduct a\n\npublic offering of a minority ownership  in the team; and was  an\n\n\"integral  aspect\" of  the conspiracy  against the  owner  of the\n\nPatriots and was likely to result from the implementation of that\n\nconspiracy.\n\n     Like McCready,  Sullivan claims,  neither the fact  that SMC\n\nstood  in a vertical relationship  to the intended  victim of the\n\n                               -13-\n\nalleged antitrust  violation (purchasers of NFL  franchises), nor\n\nthe fact that SMC's injuries might be characterized as \"indirect\"\n\ndeprive SMC of standing.  Likewise, Sullivan's failure to show an\n\nincrease  in price or a lessening of supply in the stadia market,\n\nand the fact that Sullivan's personal losses  might be derivative\n\nof  those suffered by SMC  are not dispositive.   Sullivan points\n\nout  that McCready's losses, for  example, were at  least in part\n\nderivative of those suffered  by her employer, who as  the direct\n\npurchaser  of  the  group  health  insurance  from  Blue  Shield,\n\npresumably  did  not get  the benefit  of  its bargain  with Blue\n\nShield.\n\n      We disagree that McCready favors Sullivan's right to sue.  \n                               \n\nSullivan is correct  that McCready  did stand, in  part, for  the\n                                  \n\nCourt's refusal to limit recovery to those  whose injuries result\n\nfrom the  anti-competitive effect of the violation, and to extend\n\navailable recovery at least to some parties who stand in vertical\n\nrelationship (such  as  customers) to  the  direct victim  of  an\n\nantitrust  violation.10    Thus, the  fact  that  SMC  was not  a\n\ncompetitor  in the  market for  professional football  teams, the\n\ndirect  victim of  the alleged  antitrust violation,  but in  the\n\nrelated  market for football stadia, does not by itself mean that\n\n                    \n\n10In  this respect,  we disagree  with defendants'  argument that\nSMC, merely by virtue of its status as the Patriots' landlord, is\nnecessarily barred  from bringing suit for injury  to its tenant.\nWhether  a landlord has standing to sue  for injury to its tenant\ndepends,  in part,  on the  relationship of  the landlord  to the\nrelevant market and to  the antitrust violation.  For  example, a\nlandlord may have standing to sue for injuries to a  tenant based\non  its status  as a  competitor in an  adjacent market,  see Los\n                                                                 \nAngeles Coliseum, 791 F.2d at 1363-65.\n                \n\n                               -14-\n\nhe lacks standing here.  See McCready at 472 (refusing to engraft\n                                     \n\nartificial constraints  on Section 4, stating  that \"`the statute\n\ndoes  not confine its protection to  consumers, or to purchasers,\n\nor to competitors, or  to sellers'\") (internal citation omitted).\n\n     The  circuits  are  split,  however, over  the  question  of\n\nwhether  a plaintiff must be  either a consumer  or competitor in\n\nthe market harmed by the antitrust violation at issue in order to\n\nestablish  antitrust  injury.    Some courts  have  held  that  a\n\nplaintiff may establish antitrust  injury by proof that he  was a\n\nconsumer or competitor in the relevant market, or by showing that\n                                                 \n\nhis  injury was  \"inextricably  intertwined\" with  the injury  to\n\ncompetition, in that the  plaintiff was \"`manipulated or utilized\n\nby  [d]efendant as a fulcrum,  conduit or market  force to injure\n\ncompetitors  or   participants  in   the  relevant   product  and\n\ngeographic market.'\"  Province  v.

Supp.  at 770  (quoting\n                                \nMcCready, 457 U.S. at 472); see also Ostrofe, 740 F.2d at 746-47.\n                                            \n\n                               -16-\n\nrestraining competition  in the market for  professional football\n\nfranchises, nor the  \"very means\" by which  the defendants sought\n\nto  do so.  Indeed,  according to plaintiff's  own complaint, the\n\npurpose  of the NFL policy was to \"exclude competitive entry into\n\nthe  business  of  professional  football  by  . .  .  television\n\ncompanies, motion  picture producers, investment  bankers, owners\n\nof other professional sports teams, home entertainment companies,\n\nand  entertainment  companies  generally.\"   The  policy  is  not\n\nalleged  to  have a  similar  anticompetitive  effect on  stadia.\n\nMoreover, the instruments of the alleged conspiracy were the  NFL\n\nand member club owners, not Sullivan or SMC.     \n\n     Nor does the Ninth Circuit's holding in Los Angeles Coliseum\n                                                                 \n\nbolster  Sullivan's claim that he  suffered antitrust injury.  In\n\nthat case,  the  Los Angeles  Coliseum  and the  Oakland  Raiders\n\nattempted  to negotiate  a deal  to relocate  the Raiders  to Los\n\nAngeles  to  play in  the Coliseum  (the  Rams' old  home field),\n\nfollowing the Rams' move to Anaheim.  In its effort to block this\n\nmove, the  NFL invoked a  league rule requiring  three-fourths of\n\nthe member  teams to  approve  a team's  relocation into  another\n\nteam's league  territory.  The  Coliseum and the  Raiders brought\n\nsuit, claiming that this  was an unlawful restraint of  trade, in\n\nviolation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.   1.  A jury\n\nfound  that the NFL rule violated the antitrust laws, and awarded\n\ndamages to both the Coliseum and the Raiders.  \n\n     In  holding  that the  Coliseum had  standing to  bring this\n\nantitrust  action, the court found that the Coliseum had suffered\n\n                               -17-\n\n\"antitrust injury,\" because the NFL had \"restrained competition .\n\n.  .  among football stadia by restraining the Raiders['] attempt\n\nto move and operate in Los  Angeles.\"  791 F.2d at 1364 (emphasis\n                   \n\nin  original).   Had the  Raiders been permitted  to move  to Los\n\nAngeles,  the Coliseum would have been able to bid effectively to\n\nhave them  as a tenant.   The rule  restraining such a  move, the\n\ncourt held, was  precisely of  the type that  the antitrust  laws\n\nwere designed to prevent.  Id.\n                              \n\n     The rule at issue  here posed no similar restraint  on SMC's\n\ncapacity to compete  for a pro football team's tenancy.  In fact,\n\nin 1987, the year of the attempted sale, SMC and the Patriots had\n\na lease that ran  until the year  2002, regardless of the  team's\n\nownership.\n\n                               -18-\n\n2. Directness of the Injury\n                           \n\n     Sullivan argues that SMC suffered direct harm as a result of\n\nthe NFL's restraints on the stadia market.  He maintains that Los\n                                                                 \n\nAngeles Coliseum  supports this claim, and  compares SMC's status\n                \n\nto that of the Coliseum.  \n\n     In  Los Angeles Coliseum, the Coliseum had been engaged in a\n                             \n\nbidding  struggle with  a rival  stadium for  the tenancy  of the\n\nOakland  Raiders when  the  NFL's invocation  of its  restrictive\n\nrelocation rule  foreclosed further negotiations,  thus depriving\n\nthe  Coliseum of expected revenue for leasing the facility to the\n\nRaiders for  their games.  791  F.2d at 1365.   The Ninth Circuit\n\nconcluded that the NFL's illegal territorial restraints  directly\n\nand foreseeably  restrained competition in the  stadia market, in\n\nwhich  the Coliseum participated,  and that the  harm it suffered\n\nwas a  direct result of the NFL's illegal territorial restraints.\n\nId. \n   \n\n     In an attempt to limit the reach of this  holding, the court\n\nstated  that it  was \"confident  that [this]  ruling will  not be\n\nmisinterpreted as being a broad endorsement of antitrust standing\n\nfor  all parties who might  have contracted with  the Raiders had\n\nthey not  been restrained in  their relocation  plans.   Football\n\nstadia  constitute  a  special market  distinguished  from  those\n\ncomprised   by,  say,   hotels,  laundering   establishments,  or\n\nlimousine   services,  by   their   indispensable  and   intimate\n\nconnection  with professional  football and  football teams.   An\n\ninjury  such as that suffered by the Coliseum in the present case\n\n                               -19-\n\ncannot be  characterized fairly as an  indirect `ripple effect.'\"\n\nId. at 1365.\n   \n\n     Sullivan  seems to argue that since  SMC, like the Coliseum,\n\nis a participant  in the  market for football  stadia, it  enjoys\n\nsimilar distinguished status by  virtue of its \"indispensable and\n\nintimate  connection  with  professional  football  and  football\n\nteams,\" and  should be able likewise  to recover.   The injury to\n\nSMC,  and its relation  to the rule  at issue in  this case, are,\n\nhowever, clearly distinguishable.\n\n     The rule at issue  in Los Angeles Coliseum affected  where a\n                                                               \n\nteam could be located.  In precluding a team from relocating in a\n\nparticular area,  the rule necessarily  restrained competition in\n\nthe related market for football stadia.  Once the NFL invoked its\n\nrule to block the  Raiders from moving into the  Rams' territory,\n\nthe Coliseum (and, indeed, all other stadia in that location) was\n\nbarred from competing with other stadia for the Raiders' tenancy.\n\n     The rule at issue in this case had no  similar direct effect\n\non  SMC,  nor  on  the market  in  which  it  was a  participant.\n\nPlaintiff claims  that the NFL rule  restricting public ownership\n\nof NFL teams was the \"but for\" cause of the loss of  his stadium,\n\ninjuring SMC as follows: the NFL rejected William Sullivan's plan\n\nto  sell 49% of his stock to  an investment bank, which, in turn,\n\nwould sell the  stock to the public; as a result, SMC did not get\n\nrefinancing; SMC  therefore could not pay its debts, nor complete\n\nrenovations; SMC could not  get an extension on its  lease (which\n\nwas contingent on the sale of Patriots' stock), and was forced to\n\n                               -20-\n\nfile for bankruptcy.  We think that any injury suffered by SMC as\n\na result of the NFL  rule was indirect, and a consequence  of the\n\ndirect injury inflicted on the Patriots' owner.\n\n     In addition, the  fact that William Sullivan, the party most\n\ndirectly  harmed  by  the  alleged violation,  has  pursued  (and\n\nindeed,  obtained   a  verdict  in)  his   own  antitrust  action\n\ndiminishes another  possible rationale  for allowing Sullivan  to\n\nproceed  in this case.   See Associated  General Contractors, 459\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  at 542 (existence of an identifiable class of persons whose\n\nself-interest  likely to  motivate them  to vindicate  the public\n\ninterest  in antitrust  enforcement diminishes  the justification\n\nfor allowing a more remote party to sue).12\n\n3. Speculative Nature of the Damages\n                                    \n\n                    \n\n12Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, the district court's finding\nthat there was no  significant risk of duplicative  recoveries or\ndanger  of complex apportionment of  damages is not  at odds with\nits  determination  that  the  fact  that  William  Sullivan  was\npursuing  his own  antitrust action  weighed against  a  grant of\nstanding.  In considering the risk of duplicativeness and complex\napportionment  of  damages,  courts are  concerned  with  keeping\nantitrust   actions  within   judicially  manageable   limits  by\ncurtailing litigation involving apportionment of damages among an\narray  of  parties  claiming  injury.    See  Associated  General\n                                                                 \nContractors, 459 U.S. at  543-45 &amp; nn.50-51; see  also Southaven,\n                                                                \n715  F.2d  at  1087.    In  considering  directness,  courts  are\nconcerned with the  question of which among the  affected parties\nare  most likely to be  motivated to pursue  an antitrust action.\nWhile  in the  usual  case, this  would  be those  most  directly\naffected by the antitrust violation,  in some cases, more  remote\nparties  might be more likely  to detect and  pursue an antitrust\naction.  See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542; see\n                                                                 \nalso  Ashmore,  843 F.  Supp.  at  766-67 (appropriate  to  grant\n             \nstanding  to  employees  discharged  for  refusal   to  implement\ndiscriminatory   pricing   system,  because   purchasers,  though\ndirectly  damaged by  anticompetitive  effect of  violation,  are\nleast likely to discover it).  \n\n                               -21-\n\n     The  district court  found  that \"[g]iven  that an  extended\n\nchain  of independent events would  have had to  have occurred to\n\ngive credence to the Plaintiff's damages claim on behalf of SMC,\"\n\nthe  damages claims were \"at  best, highly speculative.\"   828 F.\n\nSupp. at 118.  Sullivan claims that damages to SMC are measurable\n\nin terms of the enhanced market value of the  stadium which would\n\nhave resulted from the planned renovations,  the extension of the\n\nlease with  the  Patriots,  and  the  potential  for  deals  with\n\npromoters for  other entertainment and  sports events.   We think\n\nthat calculating these  damages would  \"necessitate wide  ranging\n\nspeculation,\" Southaven  Land Co.,  715 F.2d  at 1088,  about the\n                                 \n\nfuture value of a refinanced, renovated, debt-free stadium with a\n\nnew lease.  Because the harm to SMC was indirect, and was caused,\n\nin part,  by independent intervening factors  (notably, its prior\n\nserious indebtedness, as well as its failure to secure additional\n\nsources  of commercial  financing),  we agree  with the  district\n\ncourt that SMC's damages claims are \"highly speculative,\" and are\n\nan additional factor weighing against a grant of standing in this\n\ncase.   See  Associated  General  Contractors,  459 U.S.  at  542\n                                             \n\n(finding   that  damages  were  speculative  because  injury  was\n\nindirect, and  because it may  have been produced  by independent\n\nintervening factors).\n\n     The Ninth Circuit's holding in  Los Angeles Coliseum is  not\n                                                         \n\nto the contrary.   In that case, the estimated damages claimed by\n\nthe Coliseum included  claims for  lost profits  that would  have\n\nbeen earned had luxury  stadium boxes been built in  the Coliseum\n\n                               -22-\n\nand rented for the  1980 football season.  791 F.2d at 1366.  The\n\ncourt noted these estimates  may have been unfounded due  to lack\n\nof  proof of causation.   Id.  Nonetheless,  the court upheld the\n                             \n\ndamages award, holding that even without considering the elements\n\nin  question (lost  profits  from would-have-been  luxury boxes),\n\nthere  was  sufficient evidence,  including  attendance and  seat\n\nprice estimates offered by the Raiders, to uphold the total award\n\nof damages.  Id.\n                \n\n     Los Angeles Coliseum is distinguishable in several important\n                         \n\nrespects.   As the  Ninth  Circuit found,  the Coliseum  suffered\n\ndirect harm as a result of the NFL's antitrust violation: but for\n\nthe NFL's interference in its negotiations with the  Raiders, the\n\nColiseum likely would have  secured their tenancy.  Id.  at 1365.\n                                                       \n\nThe damages suffered were therefore intimately connected with the\n\nantitrust violation.   Moreover,  losses based on  attendance and\n\nticket  price  estimates were  the  foreseeable  result of  these\n\ndamages, and  are  precisely  the  type  of  damages  courts  can\n\ncalculate  easily.    By  contrast, the  asserted  harm  here  is\n\nindirect, and likely the result, at least in part, of independent\n\nintervening  factors;  nor is  the  enhanced  market value  of  a\n\nrefinanced, renovated, debt-free stadium with a new lease easy to\n\ncalculate.  It is the combination of  these factors that leads us\n\nto conclude  that any damages to  SMC as a result  of the alleged\n\nantitrust  violation  are  highly  speculative.   See  Associated\n                                                                 \n\nGeneral Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542.\n                   \n\n                               -23-\n\n     Having   considered   the   relevant    Associated   General\n                                                                 \n\nContractors' factors, we  conclude that the balance  in this case\n            \n\nweighs against a grant  of standing.  We therefore  conclude that\n\nSullivan may not pursue an antitrust action on behalf of SMC.\n\n      IV.  Application to Sullivan's Personal Damages Claims\n                                                            \n\n     Sullivan   also  claims  that  the  NFL's  restrictive  rule\n\ndirectly damaged him in his individual  capacity, by charging him\n\nwith  an array  of expenses  arising out  of the  SMC bankruptcy,\n\nincluding  the  payment  of  legal and  other  professional  fees\n\nassociated   with  the   bankruptcy   proceeding   itself,   lost\n\nopportunity  to   purchase  debt  at  a   discounted  rate,  lost\n\ncompensation and  benefits, and anguish  and emotional  distress.\n\nIn  that, as the district court found, these damages \"merely flow\n\nfrom the  alleged injuries to SMC,\" 828 F. Supp. at 120, they are\n\nthat  much further removed from the injuries claimed on behalf of\n\nSMC.  We therefore conclude, consistent  with our conclusion that\n\nSMC did  not  suffer \"antitrust  injury,\"  and that  any  damages\n\nsuffered were too  indirect and speculative to  sustain an action\n\non its behalf, that Sullivan likewise lacks standing to pursue an\n\nantitrust action for damages suffered in his individual capacity.\n\nThe decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n                                              \n\n                               -24-\n",

William Sullivan was unable to persuade the other NFL owners to allow his proposed deal, and in October 1988, he instead sold the team to a private buyer.  In February 1988, SMC filed a Chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy, and the stadium subsequently was sold for the \"bargain basement price\" of $25 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1991, William Sullivan sued the NFL, alleging that its policy against public ownership violated the federal antitrust laws because it unreasonably restrained trade in ownership interests in NFL teams.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Charles Sullivan filed this lawsuit several months later against the NFL and other parties allegedly responsible for enforcing the challenged rule.  He claims that, had the public offering of Patriots' stock been permitted, SMC would have received a $40 million dollar loan from the investment banking firm that would have been used to pay off debts and to make significant renovations to the stadium.  In addition, in 1987, the stadium held a lease with the Patriots which extended until 2002, which Sullivan alleges would have been extended for 20 years had the sale of the Patriots stock gone through.  Finally, he claims, the NFL policy prevented the Patriots from making their own investment in the maintenance of the stadium, thus undermining SMC's ability to keep the Patriots from breaking their lease with SMC and moving to another location.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As damages, plaintiff claims the amount of the enhanced market value of the stadium that would have resulted from the planned renovations and the lease extension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment for defendants, holding that Sullivan lacked antitrust standing.

In Associated General Contractors itself, the Court found that two factors, the causal connection between the Union's alleged injuries and the violation of the antitrust laws, and the allegation of improper motive, supported a grant of standing, 459 U.S. at 537, 103 S.Ct. at 908, but that a consideration of the remaining relevant factors weighed heavily against standing, id. at 545, 103 S.Ct. at 912.

Factors Supporting Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan argues that the district court was correct when, evaluating the relevant factors as they applied to claims brought on behalf of SMC, it found that plaintiff had alleged, and presented evidence of, a causal connection between the alleged antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff, and an improper motive on the part of defendants;  and when it found no significant risk of duplicate recoveries or danger of complex apportionment in this case.  He maintains, however, that the court erred in its determination that the absence of the remaining Associated General Contractors factors required the court to deny standing.  He contends that he has satisfied the remaining factors, and that the court should have granted him standing to press his antitrust suit, both individually and on behalf of SMC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the district court correctly found that Sullivan's complaint met three of the Associated General Contractors factors.  Sullivan alleged, and presented evidence, of a causal connection between the application of the NFL Rule and SMC's inability to refinance the stadium because the sale of Patriots' stock to the public was prohibited.  Sullivan also alleged an improper motive on the part of defendants in that they \"sought to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce in professional football\" and took the actions they did in furtherance of that goal.  In addition, Sullivan indicated that defendants intended to block the refinancing of the stadium by their actions, or, at the very least, that such a harm was a foreseeable consequence of the application of the Rule to the Patriots.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Nor does there appear to be a significant risk of duplicate recovery or danger of complex apportionment in this case, as the injuries of which Sullivan complains are sufficiently distinct from those alleged by William Sullivan, the only other plausible litigant in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Factors Defeating Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded, however, by Sullivan's argument that he satisfies the remaining Associated General Contractors' factors.  The existence of antitrust injury is a central factor in the standing calculus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In this case, its absence, together with the indirectness of the injury to Sullivan, and the speculative nature of the claimed damages, outweighs the remaining factors.  We therefore conclude that plaintiff lacks standing to pursue the claims brought on behalf of SMC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>1. The Nature of the Injury:  Is it Antitrust Injury?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan contends that he has suffered \"antitrust injury,\" that is, the type of injury that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent.  He relies principally on McCready, 457 U.S. at 465, 102 S.Ct. at 2540, and Los Angeles Coliseum, 791 F.2d at 1356, to support this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court first articulated the concept of \"antitrust injury\" in Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 429 U.S. 477, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977).  In Brunswick, several small bowling centers brought suit, challenging the acquisition of several of their competitors by the much larger Brunswick Corporation as an anticompetitive merger under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 18, and seeking treble damages under Section 4 for profits they would have made had the acquired centers gone out of business.  Id. at 480-81, 97 S.Ct. at 693.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although plaintiffs had alleged that Brunswick had engaged in predatory practices designed to lessen competition in the markets it had entered, they could prove only that Brunswick's acquisitions had deprived them of profits they would have made had the acquired firms closed.  Id. at 488, 490 &amp; nn. 15, 16, 97 S.Ct. at 697, 698 &amp; nn. 15, 16.   The Court noted that, in essence, plaintiffs were not complaining that Brunswick's actions had reduced competition, but preserved it, thereby depriving plaintiffs of the benefits of increased concentration.  Id. at 488, 97 S.Ct. at 697.   Rejecting the lower court's holding that any loss \"causally linked\" to \"the mere presence of the violator in the market\" was compensable, id. at 486-87, 97 S.Ct. at 696, the Court found that plaintiffs' injury was not of \" 'the type the [antitrust laws] were intended to forestall,' \" 429 U.S. at 487-88, 97 S.Ct. at 696-97 (citation omitted).  The Court held that to recover treble damages under Section 4, a plaintiff must prove \"antitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.\"  Id. at 489, 97 S.Ct. at 697 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 102 S.Ct. 2540, 73 L.Ed.2d 149 (1982), the first case explicitly to address antitrust standing, the Court incorporated a focus on \"antitrust injury\" into its Section 4 standing inquiry.  The plaintiff in McCready was a subscriber of Blue Shield, a health insurance plan that did not provide reimbursement for psychotherapy treatment rendered by psychologists (unless \"prescribed\" by and billed through a medical doctor), while providing reimbursement for the same treatment if given by a psychiatrist.  McCready was treated by a psychologist, and Blue Shield refused to reimburse her for this treatment.  McCready brought suit, alleging that Blue Shield and an association of psychiatrists had engaged in an unlawful conspiracy \" 'to exclude and boycott clinical psychologists from receiving compensation under' \" the Blue Shield plans, and that Blue Shield's failure to reimburse was in furtherance of this conspiracy.  McCready, 457 U.S. at 470, 102 S.Ct. at 2543.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argued that McCready had not suffered \"antitrust injury\" because her injury did not reflect the anticompetitive effect of the alleged antitrust violation.  Id. at 481-82, 102 S.Ct. at 2549-50.   McCready had not paid inflated fees for psychotherapy to psychiatrists, the supposed beneficiaries of the conspiracy;  nor had she alleged that her psychologists' bills were higher than they would have been had the conspiracy not existed.  Id. at 481, 102 S.Ct. at 2549.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court, however, refused to so limit recovery.  While not a competitor of the conspirators, the injury McCready suffered--sanction in the form of the unreimbursed psychologists' services--\"was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict\" on the market.  Id. at 483-84, 102 S.Ct. at 2550-51.   McCready suffered injury by virtue of the role she played in Blue Shield's anticompetitive scheme.  Denying reimbursement to patients of psychologists was the \"very means\" by which Blue Shield coerced her to choose between becoming an unwilling participant in its illegal campaign to boycott the services of psychologists, or to pay the costs of treatment for the therapist of her choice from her own pocket.  The harm to McCready was thus a \"necessary step in effecting the ends of the alleged illegal conspiracy.\"  Id. at 479, 102 S.Ct. at 2548.   The Court therefore found that McCready's injury \" 'flow[ed] from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful,' within the meaning of Brunswick,\" falling \"squarely within the area of congressional concern.\"  Id. at 484, 102 S.Ct. at 2551.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan argues that the logic of McCready supports his standing.  In Sullivan's view, the NFL rule at issue affected competition in the market for football stadia by preventing SMC from obtaining refinancing to pay for renovations that would have led the Patriots to extend their lease, and by interfering with the Patriots' capacity to invest money in the maintenance of their stadium, thus undermining SMC's ability to keep the Patriots from breaking their lease with SMC and moving to another location.  Further, the injury to SMC was \"inextricably intertwined\" with that to the owner of the New England Patriots, since SMC expected to benefit from a joint proposal to conduct a public offering of a minority ownership in the team;  and was an \"integral aspect\" of the conspiracy against the owner of the Patriots and was likely to result from the implementation of that conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like McCready, Sullivan claims, neither the fact that SMC stood in a vertical relationship to the intended victim of the alleged antitrust violation (purchasers of NFL franchises), nor the fact that SMC's injuries might be characterized as \"indirect\" deprive SMC of standing.  Likewise, Sullivan's failure to show an increase in price or a lessening of supply in the stadia market, and the fact that Sullivan's personal losses might be derivative of those suffered by SMC are not dispositive.  Sullivan points out that McCready's losses, for example, were at least in part derivative of those suffered by her employer, who as the direct purchaser of the group health insurance from Blue Shield, presumably did not get the benefit of its bargain with Blue Shield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree that McCready favors Sullivan's right to sue.  Sullivan is correct that McCready did stand, in part, for the Court's refusal to limit recovery to those whose injuries result from the anti-competitive effect of the violation, and to extend available recovery at least to some parties who stand in vertical relationship (such as customers) to the direct victim of an antitrust violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Thus, the fact that SMC was not a competitor in the market for professional football teams, the direct victim of the alleged antitrust violation, but in the related market for football stadia, does not by itself mean that he lacks standing here.  See McCready at 472, 102 S.Ct. at 2544 (refusing to engraft artificial constraints on Section 4, stating that \" 'the statute does not confine its protection to consumers, or to purchasers, or to competitors, or to sellers' \") (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuits are split, however, over the question of whether a plaintiff must be either a consumer or competitor in the market harmed by the antitrust violation at issue in order to establish antitrust injury.  Some courts have held that a plaintiff may establish antitrust injury by proof that he was a consumer or competitor in the relevant market, or by showing that his injury was \"inextricably intertwined\" with the injury to competition, in that the plaintiff was \" 'manipulated or utilized by [d]efendant as a fulcrum, conduit or market force to injure competitors or participants in the relevant product and geographic market.' \"  Province v. Cleveland Press Pub. Co., 787 F.2d 1047, 1052 (6th Cir.1986) (quoting Southaven, 715 F.2d at 1086);  see Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., Inc., 740 F.2d 739, 745-46 (9th Cir.1984) (though neither a consumer nor competitor in the relevant market, fact that injury to plaintiff was a necessary means to achieve the conspirators' illegal end sufficient to establish antitrust injury);  Ashmore v. Northeast Petroleum Division of Cargill, 843 F.Supp. 759, 769-70 (same);  Donahue v. Pendleton Woolen Mills, 633 F.Supp. 1423, 1435-39 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (following Ostrofe ).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have interpreted Supreme Court caselaw and the antitrust laws more narrowly, holding that a plaintiff must be a market participant in order to establish antitrust injury.  See Bichan v. Chemetron Corp., 681 F.2d 514, 519 (7th Cir.1982) (Section 4 protects only parties injured as customers or competitors in a defined market, or in a discrete area of the economy);  see also Winther v. DEC International, Inc., 625 F.Supp. 100, 102-03 (D.Colo.1985).  We need not resolve this conflict, because even under a broad reading of McCready, SMC cannot support its claim of antitrust injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read broadly, McCready extends antitrust standing to parties who can establish that their injury was a \"necessary step\" and the \"means\" employed by the conspirators to achieve their illegal ends, regardless of the parties' direct market participation.  See McCready, 457 U.S. at 479, 484 n. 21, 102 S.Ct. at 2548, 2551 n. 21;  Ostrofe, 740 F.2d at 745-46;  Ashmore, 843 F.Supp. at 768-70 &amp; nn. 16, 18.   Unlike McCready and her co-plaintiffs, neither Sullivan nor SMC were \"necessary\" instruments to effectuate the alleged conspiracy.  Denying stadium refinancing was not a \"necessary step\" in restraining competition in the market for professional football franchises, nor the \"very means\" by which the defendants sought to do so.  Indeed, according to plaintiff's own complaint, the purpose of the NFL policy was to \"exclude competitive entry into the business of professional football by ... television companies, motion picture producers, investment bankers, owners of other professional sports teams, home entertainment companies, and entertainment companies generally.\"   The policy is not alleged to have a similar anticompetitive effect on stadia.  Moreover, the instruments of the alleged conspiracy were the NFL and member club owners, not Sullivan or SMC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Ninth Circuit's holding in Los Angeles Coliseum bolster Sullivan's claim that he suffered antitrust injury.  In that case, the Los Angeles Coliseum and the Oakland Raiders attempted to negotiate a deal to relocate the Raiders to Los Angeles to play in the Coliseum (the Rams' old home field), following the Rams' move to Anaheim.  In its effort to block this move, the NFL invoked a league rule requiring three-fourths of the member teams to approve a team's relocation into another team's league territory.  The Coliseum and the Raiders brought suit, claiming that this was an unlawful restraint of trade, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1.  A jury found that the NFL rule violated the antitrust laws, and awarded damages to both the Coliseum and the Raiders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In holding that the Coliseum had standing to bring this antitrust action, the court found that the Coliseum had suffered \"antitrust injury,\" because the NFL had \"restrained competition ... among football stadia by restraining the Raiders['] attempt to move and operate in Los Angeles.\"  791 F.2d at 1364 (emphasis in original).  Had the Raiders been permitted to move to Los Angeles, the Coliseum would have been able to bid effectively to have them as a tenant.  The rule restraining such a move, the court held, was precisely of the type that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule at issue here posed no similar restraint on SMC's capacity to compete for a pro football team's tenancy.  In fact, in 1987, the year of the attempted sale, SMC and the Patriots had a lease that ran until the year 2002, regardless of the team's ownership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Directness of the Injury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan argues that SMC suffered direct harm as a result of the NFL's restraints on the stadia market.  He maintains that Los Angeles Coliseum supports this claim, and compares SMC's status to that of the Coliseum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Los Angeles Coliseum, the Coliseum had been engaged in a bidding struggle with a rival stadium for the tenancy of the Oakland Raiders when the NFL's invocation of its restrictive relocation rule foreclosed further negotiations, thus depriving the Coliseum of expected revenue for leasing the facility to the Raiders for their games.  791 F.2d at 1365.   The Ninth Circuit concluded that the NFL's illegal territorial restraints directly and foreseeably restrained competition in the stadia market, in which the Coliseum participated, and that the harm it suffered was a direct result of the NFL's illegal territorial restraints.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to limit the reach of this holding, the court stated that it was \"confident that [this] ruling will not be misinterpreted as being a broad endorsement of antitrust standing for all parties who might have contracted with the Raiders had they not been restrained in their relocation plans.  Football stadia constitute a special market distinguished from those comprised by, say, hotels, laundering establishments, or limousine services, by their indispensable and intimate connection with professional football and football teams.  An injury such as that suffered by the Coliseum in the present case cannot be characterized fairly as an indirect 'ripple effect.' \"  Id. at 1365.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan seems to argue that since SMC, like the Coliseum, is a participant in the market for football stadia, it enjoys similar distinguished status by virtue of its \"indispensable and intimate connection with professional football and football teams,\" and should be able likewise to recover.  The injury to SMC, and its relation to the rule at issue in this case, are, however, clearly distinguishable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule at issue in Los Angeles Coliseum affected where a team could be located.  In precluding a team from relocating in a particular area, the rule necessarily restrained competition in the related market for football stadia.  Once the NFL invoked its rule to block the Raiders from moving into the Rams' territory, the Coliseum (and, indeed, all other stadia in that location) was barred from competing with other stadia for the Raiders' tenancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule at issue in this case had no similar direct effect on SMC, nor on the market in which it was a participant.  Plaintiff claims that the NFL rule restricting public ownership of NFL teams was the \"but for\" cause of the loss of his stadium, injuring SMC as follows:  the NFL rejected William Sullivan's plan to sell 49% of his stock to an investment bank, which, in turn, would sell the stock to the public;  as a result, SMC did not get refinancing;  SMC therefore could not pay its debts, nor complete renovations;  SMC could not get an extension on its lease (which was contingent on the sale of Patriots' stock), and was forced to file for bankruptcy.  We think that any injury suffered by SMC as a result of the NFL rule was indirect, and a consequence of the direct injury inflicted on the Patriots' owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the fact that William Sullivan, the party most directly harmed by the alleged violation, has pursued (and indeed, obtained a verdict in) his own antitrust action diminishes another possible rationale for allowing Sullivan to proceed in this case.  See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542, 103 S.Ct. at 910 (existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest likely to motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement diminishes the justification for allowing a more remote party to sue).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Speculative Nature of the Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that \"[g]iven that an extended chain of independent events would have had to have occurred to give credence to the Plaintiff's damages claim on behalf of SMC,\" the damages claims were \"at best, highly speculative.\"  828 F.Supp. at 118.   Sullivan claims that damages to SMC are measurable in terms of the enhanced market value of the stadium which would have resulted from the planned renovations, the extension of the lease with the Patriots, and the potential for deals with promoters for other entertainment and sports events.  We think that calculating these damages would \"necessitate wide ranging speculation,\" Southaven Land Co., 715 F.2d at 1088, about the future value of a refinanced, renovated, debt-free stadium with a new lease.  Because the harm to SMC was indirect, and was caused, in part, by independent intervening factors (notably, its prior serious indebtedness, as well as its failure to secure additional sources of commercial financing), we agree with the district court that SMC's damages claims are \"highly speculative,\" and are an additional factor weighing against a grant of standing in this case.  See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542, 103 S.Ct. at 910 (finding that damages were speculative because injury was indirect, and because it may have been produced by independent intervening factors).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit's holding in Los Angeles Coliseum is not to the contrary.  In that case, the estimated damages claimed by the Coliseum included claims for lost profits that would have been earned had luxury stadium boxes been built in the Coliseum and rented for the 1980 football season.  791 F.2d at 1366.   The court noted these estimates may have been unfounded due to lack of proof of causation.  Id.  Nonetheless, the court upheld the damages award, holding that even without considering the elements in question (lost profits from would-have-been luxury boxes), there was sufficient evidence, including attendance and seat price estimates offered by the Raiders, to uphold the total award of damages.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Los Angeles Coliseum is distinguishable in several important respects.  As the Ninth Circuit found, the Coliseum suffered direct harm as a result of the NFL's antitrust violation:  but for the NFL's interference in its negotiations with the Raiders, the Coliseum likely would have secured their tenancy.  Id. at 1365.   The damages suffered were therefore intimately connected with the antitrust violation.  Moreover, losses based on attendance and ticket price estimates were the foreseeable result of these damages, and are precisely the type of damages courts can calculate easily.  By contrast, the asserted harm here is indirect, and likely the result, at least in part, of independent intervening factors;  nor is the enhanced market value of a refinanced, renovated, debt-free stadium with a new lease easy to calculate.  It is the combination of these factors that leads us to conclude that any damages to SMC as a result of the alleged antitrust violation are highly speculative.

The two most commonly stated tests focused on the \"directness of the injury\" to the alleged antitrust violation, and whether a plaintiff was in the \"target area\" of the antitrust conspiracy.  See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 535-36 &amp; n. 33, 103 S.Ct. at 907 &amp; n. 33 (citations omitted);  Phillip E. Areeda &amp; Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, p 334.1 (1993 Supp.).  A third test considered whether the injury was \" 'arguably within the zone of interests protected by the antitrust laws.' \"  Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 536 n. 33, 103 S.Ct. at 907 n. 33 (citation omitted).  In Associated General Contractors, the Court, noting that it was \"virtually impossible to announce a black-letter rule that will dictate the result in every case,\" 459 U.S. at 536, 103 S.Ct. at 907, drew on these tests to outline a series of factors to guide courts in deciding whether a private plaintiff should have standing to pursue an antitrust action in a particular case.

Kansas City Southern Industries, 880 F.2d 40, 46 (8th Cir.1989) (noting primacy of antitrust injury requirement).  Cf. Cargill, Inc. v.

We need not consider, however, whether this should be fatal to standing in every instance, because in the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the balance of factors as a whole weighs against a grant of standing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In this respect, we disagree with defendants' argument that SMC, merely by virtue of its status as the Patriots' landlord, is necessarily barred from bringing suit for injury to its tenant.  Whether a landlord has standing to sue for injury to its tenant depends, in part, on the relationship of the landlord to the relevant market and to the antitrust violation.  For example, a landlord may have standing to sue for injuries to a tenant based on its status as a competitor in an adjacent market, see Los Angeles Coliseum, 791 F.2d at 1363-65</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> These courts reason that the injury suffered by a plaintiff used as a means to effect an antitrust violation is within the core of Congressional concern underlying the antitrust laws, which is \"to create a private enforcement mechanism that would deter violators and deprive them of the fruits of their illegal actions and would provide ample compensation to the victims of antitrust violations.\"  Ashmore, 843 F.Supp. at 770 (quoting McCready, 457 U.S. at 472, 102 S.Ct. at 2544);  see also Ostrofe, 740 F.2d at 746-47</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, the district court's finding that there was no significant risk of duplicative recoveries or danger of complex apportionment of damages is not at odds with its determination that the fact that William Sullivan was pursuing his own antitrust action weighed against a grant of standing.  In considering the risk of duplicativeness and complex apportionment of damages, courts are concerned with keeping antitrust actions within judicially manageable limits by curtailing litigation involving apportionment of damages among an array of parties claiming injury.  See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 543-45 &amp; nn. 50-51, 103 S.Ct. at 911-12 &amp; nn. 50-51;   see also Southaven, 715 F.2d at 1087.   In considering directness, courts are concerned with the question of which among the affected parties are most likely to be motivated to pursue an antitrust action.  While in the usual case, this would be those most directly affected by the antitrust violation, in some cases, more remote parties might be more likely to detect and pursue an antitrust action.   See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542, 103 S.Ct. at 910;   see also Ashmore, 843 F.Supp. at 766-67 (appropriate to grant standing to employees discharged for refusal to implement discriminatory pricing system, because purchasers, though directly damaged by anticompetitive effect of violation, are least likely to discover it)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

His father, William Sullivan, was the Patriots' owner at all relevant times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, William Sullivan sought to sell a 49% interest in the Patriots to an investment banking firm not in the business of football, which, in turn, was to sell the shares to the public.  Through this transaction, plaintiff, through SMC, expected to obtain financing for his stadium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the terms of the NFL Constitution and By-Laws, member teams are not permitted to sell shares to the public unless three-fourths of the members approve.  William Sullivan was unable to persuade the other NFL owners to allow his proposed deal, and in October 1988, he instead sold the team to a private buyer.  In February 1988, SMC filed a Chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy, and the stadium subsequently was sold for the \"bargain basement price\" of $25 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1991, William Sullivan sued the NFL, alleging that its policy against public ownership violated the federal antitrust laws because it unreasonably restrained trade in ownership interests in NFL teams.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Charles Sullivan filed this lawsuit several months later against the NFL and other parties allegedly responsible for enforcing the challenged rule.  He claims that, had the public offering of Patriots' stock been permitted, SMC would have received a $40 million dollar loan from the investment banking firm that would have been used to pay off debts and to make significant renovations to the stadium.  In addition, in 1987, the stadium held a lease with the Patriots which extended until 2002, which Sullivan alleges would have been extended for 20 years had the sale of the Patriots stock gone through.  Finally, he claims, the NFL policy prevented the Patriots from making their own investment in the maintenance of the stadium, thus undermining SMC's ability to keep the Patriots from breaking their lease with SMC and moving to another location.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As damages, plaintiff claims the amount of the enhanced market value of the stadium that would have resulted from the planned renovations and the lease extension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment for defendants, holding that Sullivan lacked antitrust standing.  The court reached this conclusion by determining that the materials submitted indisputably showed that the injury plaintiff suffered was not within the type contemplated by the antitrust laws;  that its impact was too indirect;  and that the damages claimed were too speculative.

Under Section 4, \"[A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found ... without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statutory language is broad, conferring the right to sue on \"any person\" claiming an injury causally related to an antitrust injury.

Factors Supporting Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan argues that the district court was correct when, evaluating the relevant factors as they applied to claims brought on behalf of SMC, it found that plaintiff had alleged, and presented evidence of, a causal connection between the alleged antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff, and an improper motive on the part of defendants;  and when it found no significant risk of duplicate recoveries or danger of complex apportionment in this case.  He maintains, however, that the court erred in its determination that the absence of the remaining Associated General Contractors factors required the court to deny standing.  He contends that he has satisfied the remaining factors, and that the court should have granted him standing to press his antitrust suit, both individually and on behalf of SMC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the district court correctly found that Sullivan's complaint met three of the Associated General Contractors factors.  Sullivan alleged, and presented evidence, of a causal connection between the application of the NFL Rule and SMC's inability to refinance the stadium because the sale of Patriots' stock to the public was prohibited.  Sullivan also alleged an improper motive on the part of defendants in that they \"sought to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce in professional football\" and took the actions they did in furtherance of that goal.  In addition, Sullivan indicated that defendants intended to block the refinancing of the stadium by their actions, or, at the very least, that such a harm was a foreseeable consequence of the application of the Rule to the Patriots.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Nor does there appear to be a significant risk of duplicate recovery or danger of complex apportionment in this case, as the injuries of which Sullivan complains are sufficiently distinct from those alleged by William Sullivan, the only other plausible litigant in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

The existence of antitrust injury is a central factor in the standing calculus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In this case, its absence, together with the indirectness of the injury to Sullivan, and the speculative nature of the claimed damages, outweighs the remaining factors.

The plaintiff in McCready was a subscriber of Blue Shield, a health insurance plan that did not provide reimbursement for psychotherapy treatment rendered by psychologists (unless \"prescribed\" by and billed through a medical doctor), while providing reimbursement for the same treatment if given by a psychiatrist.  McCready was treated by a psychologist, and Blue Shield refused to reimburse her for this treatment.  McCready brought suit, alleging that Blue Shield and an association of psychiatrists had engaged in an unlawful conspiracy \" 'to exclude and boycott clinical psychologists from receiving compensation under' \" the Blue Shield plans, and that Blue Shield's failure to reimburse was in furtherance of this conspiracy.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110752\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">McCready,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110752/blue-shield-of-va-v-mccready/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 102 S.Ct. at 2543.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argued that McCready had not suffered \"antitrust injury\" because her injury did not reflect the anticompetitive effect of the alleged antitrust violation.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110752\"><a href=\"/opinion/110752/blue-shield-of-va-v-mccready/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 481-82, </a></span>102 S.Ct. at 2549-50.

McCready suffered injury by virtue of the role she played in Blue Shield's anticompetitive scheme.  Denying reimbursement to patients of psychologists was the \"very means\" by which Blue Shield coerced her to choose between becoming an unwilling participant in its illegal campaign to boycott the services of psychologists, or to pay the costs of treatment for the therapist of her choice from her own pocket.  The harm to McCready was thus a \"necessary step in effecting the ends of the alleged illegal conspiracy.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110752\"><a href=\"/opinion/110752/blue-shield-of-va-v-mccready/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 479, </a></span>102 S.Ct. at 2548.   The Court therefore found that McCready's injury \" 'flow[ed] from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful,' within the meaning of Brunswick,\" falling \"squarely within the area of congressional concern.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110752\"><a href=\"/opinion/110752/blue-shield-of-va-v-mccready/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 484, </a></span>102 S.Ct. at 2551.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan argues that the logic of McCready supports his standing.  In Sullivan's view, the NFL rule at issue affected competition in the market for football stadia by preventing SMC from obtaining refinancing to pay for renovations that would have led the Patriots to extend their lease, and by interfering with the Patriots' capacity to invest money in the maintenance of their stadium, thus undermining SMC's ability to keep the Patriots from breaking their lease with SMC and moving to another location.  Further, the injury to SMC was \"inextricably intertwined\" with that to the owner of the New England Patriots, since SMC expected to benefit from a joint proposal to conduct a public offering of a minority ownership in the team;  and was an \"integral aspect\" of the conspiracy against the owner of the Patriots and was likely to result from the implementation of that conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like McCready, Sullivan claims, neither the fact that SMC stood in a vertical relationship to the intended victim of the alleged antitrust violation (purchasers of NFL franchises), nor the fact that SMC's injuries might be characterized as \"indirect\" deprive SMC of standing.  Likewise, Sullivan's failure to show an increase in price or a lessening of supply in the stadia market, and the fact that Sullivan's personal losses might be derivative of those suffered by SMC are not dispositive.  Sullivan points out that McCready's losses, for example, were at least in part derivative of those suffered by her employer, who as the direct purchaser of the group health insurance from Blue Shield, presumably did not get the benefit of its bargain with Blue Shield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree that McCready favors Sullivan's right to sue.  Sullivan is correct that McCready did stand, in part, for the Court's refusal to limit recovery to those whose injuries result from the anti-competitive effect of the violation, and to extend available recovery at least to some parties who stand in vertical relationship (such as customers) to the direct victim of an antitrust violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Thus, the fact that SMC was not a competitor in the market for professional football teams, the direct victim of the alleged antitrust violation, but in the related market for football stadia, does not by itself mean that he lacks standing here.

Unlike McCready and her co-plaintiffs, neither Sullivan nor SMC were \"necessary\" instruments to effectuate the alleged conspiracy.  Denying stadium refinancing was not a \"necessary step\" in restraining competition in the market for professional football franchises, nor the \"very means\" by which the defendants sought to do so.  Indeed, according to plaintiff's own complaint, the purpose of the NFL policy was to \"exclude competitive entry into the business of professional football by ... television companies, motion picture producers, investment bankers, owners of other professional sports teams, home entertainment companies, and entertainment companies generally.\"   The policy is not alleged to have a similar anticompetitive effect on stadia.

In that case, the Los Angeles Coliseum and the Oakland Raiders attempted to negotiate a deal to relocate the Raiders to Los Angeles to play in the Coliseum (the Rams' old home field), following the Rams' move to Anaheim.  In its effort to block this move, the NFL invoked a league rule requiring three-fourths of the member teams to approve a team's relocation into another team's league territory.  The Coliseum and the Raiders brought suit, claiming that this was an unlawful restraint of trade, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1.  A jury found that the NFL rule violated the antitrust laws, and awarded damages to both the Coliseum and the Raiders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In holding that the Coliseum had standing to bring this antitrust action, the court found that the Coliseum had suffered \"antitrust injury,\" because the NFL had \"restrained competition ... among football stadia by restraining the Raiders['] attempt to move and operate in Los <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Angeles.\"</span>  <span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1364</span> </span>(emphasis in original).

Plaintiff claims that the NFL rule restricting public ownership of NFL teams was the \"but for\" cause of the loss of his stadium, injuring SMC as follows:  the NFL rejected William Sullivan's plan to sell 49% of his stock to an investment bank, which, in turn, would sell the stock to the public;  as a result, SMC did not get refinancing;  SMC therefore could not pay its debts, nor complete renovations;  SMC could not get an extension on its lease (which was contingent on the sale of Patriots' stock), and was forced to file for bankruptcy.  We think that any injury suffered by SMC as a result of the NFL rule was indirect, and a consequence of the direct injury inflicted on the Patriots' owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the fact that William Sullivan, the party most directly harmed by the alleged violation, has pursued (and indeed, obtained a verdict in) his own antitrust action diminishes another possible rationale for allowing Sullivan to proceed in this case.

Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">118</span></span>.   Sullivan claims that damages to SMC are measurable in terms of the enhanced market value of the stadium which would have resulted from the planned renovations, the extension of the lease with the Patriots, and the potential for deals with promoters for other entertainment and sports events.  We think that calculating these damages would \"necessitate wide ranging speculation,\" Southaven Land <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423945\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/423945/southaven-land-co-inc-v-malone-hyde-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1088</span></a></span>, about the future value of a refinanced, renovated, debt-free stadium with a new lease.  Because the harm to SMC was indirect, and was caused, in part, by independent intervening factors (notably, its prior serious indebtedness, as well as its failure to secure additional sources of commercial financing), we agree with the district court that SMC's damages claims are \"highly speculative,\" and are an additional factor weighing against a grant of standing in this case.  See Associated General <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110831\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Contractors,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110831/associated-gen-contractors-of-cal-inc-v-carpenters/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. at 910 (finding that damages were speculative because injury was indirect, and because it may have been produced by independent intervening factors).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit's holding in Los Angeles Coliseum is not to the contrary.  In that case, the estimated damages claimed by the Coliseum included claims for lost profits that would have been earned had luxury stadium boxes been built in the Coliseum and rented for the 1980 football <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">season.</span>  <span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1366</span></span>.   The court noted these estimates may have been unfounded due to lack of proof of causation.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Nonetheless, the </span>court upheld the damages award, holding that even without considering the elements in question (lost profits from would-have-been luxury boxes), there was sufficient evidence, including attendance and seat price estimates offered by the Raiders, to uphold the total award of damages.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Los Angeles Coliseum is distinguishable in several important respects.  As the Ninth Circuit found, the Coliseum suffered direct harm as a result of the NFL's antitrust violation:  but for the NFL's interference in its negotiations with the Raiders, the Coliseum likely would have secured their tenancy.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1365. </span>  The damages suffered were therefore intimately connected with the antitrust violation.  Moreover, losses based on attendance and ticket price estimates were the foreseeable result of these damages, and are precisely the type of damages courts can calculate easily.  By contrast, the asserted harm here is indirect, and likely the result, at least in part, of independent intervening factors;  nor is the enhanced market value of a refinanced, renovated, debt-free stadium with a new lease easy to calculate.  It is the combination of these factors that leads us to conclude that any damages to SMC as a result of the alleged antitrust violation are highly speculative.

In that, as the district court found, these damages \"merely flow from the alleged injuries to <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">SMC,\"</span> <span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
