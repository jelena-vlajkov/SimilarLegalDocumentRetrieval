The alleged malpractice involved treatment of a knee\n\ninjury which plaintiff sustained while  he was on active duty\n\nin  the United States Army.

In Feres the Court\r                                                               \n\nheld  that the  FTCA's limited  waiver of  sovereign immunity\n\ndoes not extend to \"injuries to servicemen where the injuries\n\narise  out of  or are in  the course of  activity incident to\n\nservice.\"  Feres, 340 U.S. at 146.   \r                            \n\n          Plaintiff argues on appeal that  the Feres doctrine\r                                                                \n\ndoes not  apply  because:  (1) he  was  \"off  duty,\"  playing\n\nbasketball, when he suffered his  first knee injury, and  (2)\n\nthe  medical  care  he  received in  military  hospitals  was\n\nrendered in  part by  civilian employees.   A straightforward\n\napplication  of  the  \"incident to  service\"  test,  however,\n\ndepends  on  plaintiff's  military   status  in  relation  to\n\ndefendant's   allegedly   negligent   provision  of   medical\n\ntreatment.   Accord Hata v.  United States, 23  F.3d 230, 235\r                                                      \n\n(9th  Cir. 1994);  Quintana  v.

Plaintiff  was an  active\r                     \n\nservicemember  who was  entitled  to medical  treatment at  a\n\nmilitary hospital precisely  because of his  military status.\n\nAccordingly, his  claim is  barred regardless of  the medical\n\ncondition treated  or the  civilian status of  the government\n\nemployees who allegedly  participated in it.  See Loughney v.\r                                                                      \n\nUnited States,  839  F.2d 186,  188  (3d Cir.  1988)  (citing\r                         \n\nUnited States v.

In essence, he challenges the wisdom of\n\nthe Feres  doctrine.   This court is  fundamentally precluded\r                     \n\nfrom   deviating   from   the   doctrine,   which  has   been\n\nconsistently, and recently, reaffirmed by the Supreme  Court.\n\nSee Johnson, 481 U.S. at 688-90 &amp; n.5.      \r                       \n\n          In light  of this disposition, we  need not address\n\nthe other infirmities in plaintiff's complaint.\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \n\n                              3\r\r\n",
