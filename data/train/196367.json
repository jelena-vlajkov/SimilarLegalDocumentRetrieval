Hobart, Assistant United  States Attorney, with  whom\r                               \r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\r                                               \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per  Curiam.     Appellant,  who  pled  guilty   to\r                                 \r\n\nconspiracy  and to possession of cocaine with intent to sell,\r\n\nappeals because of the sentencing  court's failure to allow a\r\n\nthree  point   reduction  in  his  base   offense  level  for\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility.  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.  We affirm.\r\n\n          The appeal  is a classic  example of taking  off on\r\n\nthe  wrong foot.  Appellant's  brief flatly charges the court\r\n\nwith \"totally disregarding the plea [agreement].\"  \"Appellant\r\n\nspecifically  bargained for, and  expected, . . .  the three-\r\n\npoint  reduction . . . when entering his plea.\"  This was not\r\n\nso.  The agreement is to be read as a whole  for what it was.\r\n\nIt was  between the  parties.   Appellant fails  to recognize\r\n\nthat  though it  stated  he was  entitled  to a  three  point\r\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility, the agreement was\r\n\nthat  the government  would so  recommend at  sentencing, and\r\n\nexpressly recited that it was not  binding on the court.   In\r\n\naddition,  the  court  orally  repeated  this  admonition  to\r\n\nappellant before accepting his plea.\r\n\n          The Presentence Report originally  recommended that\r\n\nappellant   be   recognized   as  accepting   responsibility.\r\n\nThereafter,  however,  a  supplementary  report  recited  new\r\n\ninformation tending to  show appellant's previous  statements\r\n\nabout his role  to be  \"an extreme minimization  of his  true\r\n\noffense behavior.\"   The government acknowledged  that it was\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nnonetheless  bound  by  the  agreement, and  recommended  the\r\n\nreduction.\r\n\n          Appellant was  allowed to address  the court before\r\n\nthe   sentencing,   besides  presenting   his   case  through\r\n\ncounsel.1  The court ultimately ruled,\r\n\n               I do not find on the totality of the\r\n          record before the Court that  there's any\r\n          genuine   acceptance   of  responsibility\r\n          here.\r\n\nThe record  was short, but there was  adequate foundation for\r\n\nthe court's conclusion.  See United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n28,  29, 30 (1st Cir.  1990).  Appellant  spoke frequently of\r\n\nhis children -- which the court said was irrelevant -- of the\r\n\ntaxes  he  had paid,  and the  information  he had  given the\r\n\ngovernment -- which the prosecutor felt had not been truthful\r\n\n-- and, generally, how, though  guilty, he was not as bad  as\r\n\nwas  made out.   Acceptance  of responsibility  involves more\r\n\nthan repetition  of a formula.   Id. at 30; United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nOcasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993).   The burden is\r                         \r\n\non the  defendant to prove  entitlement to a  reduction, id.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nand we  see no clear error.   Id. at 5  (\"[w]here a defendant\r                                             \r\n\nresorts to evasions, distortions, or half-truths in an effort\r\n\nto  minimize  his   culpability,\"  the  court   may  withhold\r\n\nacceptance-of-responsibility credit under   3E1.1).\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.
