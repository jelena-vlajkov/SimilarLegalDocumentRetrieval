Over twenty-four centuries ago,\n          SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\n                               \n\na Greek philosopher warned that \"[h]aste in every business brings\n\nfailures.\"   VII  Herodotus,  Histories, ch.  10.    This  appeal\n                                       \n\nillustrates that courts are no exception  to the rule.  The  tale\n\nfollows.\n\n                                I\n\n          Plaintiffs, former  members  of  the  Zoning  Board  of\n\nAppeals of Tewksbury, Massachusetts, claimed that defendants (the\n\ntown   and  various  municipal  officials)  had  ousted  them  in\n\nderogation of  their First  Amendment guarantees.   They  brought\n\nthis civil rights action in federal district court seeking, inter\n                                                                 \n\nalia,  reinstatement and  money  damages.    The  case  proceeded\n    \n\nuneventfully through the discovery phase.  The day of trial found\n\nthe parties  ready for a full-dress courtroom confrontation.  But\n\neven as  the attorneys  surveyed prospective  jurors, a  visiting\n\njudge,  new to  the case,  directed defendants  to move  then and\n\nthere for  summary judgment.   The  judge accepted  a perfunctory\n\noral  motion and  gave the  parties  thirty minutes  in which  to\n\nprepare  for argument.   Plaintiffs  objected  to this  procedure\n\nwithout  avail.   Following  a hearing  that consisted  mainly of\n\ncounsels' haranguing, the  judge again brushed  aside plaintiffs'\n\nprotest anent  the  procedure and  informed the  parties that  he\n\nwould  issue  a  bench  decision  three days  later.    When  the\n\nlitigants  appeared  as  ordered, a  further  exchange  occurred,\n\nculminating  in the  entry of  summary  judgment for  defendants.\n\nThis appeal ensued.\n\n                                2\n\n          Although we  understand defendants' entreaties  that we\n\nturn  a blind eye to procedural  irregularities and focus instead\n\non whether the presence of genuine issues of material fact can be\n\ndiscerned,  we decline to  delve into the  substantive aspects of\n\nplaintiffs'  cause  of   action.    Given  the   case's  posture,\n\nleapfrogging to the merits would display  much the same disregard\n\nfor   established  protocol  that  marred  the  district  court's\n\nperformance.  Courts cannot make  up new rules as they go  along,\n\nwhether  to promote  notions of  judicial  economy or  to suit  a\n\njudge's  fancy.    Because  the lower  court  employed  a  flawed\n\nprocedural  regime, we reverse  its ruling, vacate  the judgment,\n\nand reinstate the case for trial.1\n\n                                II\n\n          Although defendants moved orally for summary  judgment,\n\ntheir motion  was made  at the direction  of the court.   Placing\n\nsubstance  over form, we regard what transpired as the functional\n\nequivalent of  a sua  sponte grant of  summary judgment.   To  be\n                            \n\nsure,  district courts  possess  the  power  to  trigger  summary\n\njudgment on  their own  initiative, see,  e.g., Jardines  Bacata,\n                                                                 \n\nLtd. v.  Diaz-Marquez, 878 F.2d  1555, 1560 (1st Cir.  1989), but\n                     \n\nthe power is  invariably tempered by the need to  ensure that the\n\nparties   are  given  adequate  notice  to  bring  forward  their\n\nevidence.   See  Celotex  Corp.  v. Catrett,  477  U.S. 317,  326\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n     1We express  no opinion as  to whether defendants  should be\nallowed,  at this  late date,  to  file a  properly authenticated\nmotion for summary judgment in the court below.  That matter   as\nwell as the  related matter of the viability of such a motion, if\nfiled   is for the district court.\n\n                                3\n\n(1986); Jardines  Bacata, 878 F.2d  at 1561; Bonilla  v. Nazario,\n                                                                \n\n843 F.2d  34, 37 (1st  Cir. 1988).   In this connection,  we have\n\nwarned that a court's power  to grant summary judgment sua sponte\n                                                                 \n\nshould be used  with great circumspection.  As the case before us\n\nillustrates, \"[c]ourts that yearn  for the blossom when only  the\n\nbud  is  ready act  at their  peril; proceeding  with unnecessary\n\nhaste frequently results in more leisurely repentance.\"  Jardines\n                                                                 \n\nBacata, 878 F.2d at 1560-61.\n      \n\n          Although summary judgment is  a useful shortcut leading\n\nto final adjudication  on the merits in a  relatively small class\n\nof cases, its proper province is  to weed out claims that do  not\n\nwarrant trial rather than simply  to clear a court's docket.   To\n\nallow  summary judgment, a  court must  find, after  studying the\n\nparties'   evidentiary  proffers   and  giving  the   benefit  of\n\nreasonable doubt to  those against whom  the motion is  directed,\n\nthat there is  no genuine issue of  material fact in dispute  and\n\nthat the motion's  proponent is entitled to judgment  as a matter\n\nof law.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P.  56(c).  Since Rule 56  provides in\n            \n\npart that motions for summary  judgment \"shall be served at least\n\n10 days  before the  time fixed for  the hearing,\"  and expressly\n\nallows  nonmovants to  \"serve opposing  affidavits\"  at any  time\n\nprior to  the day of  the hearing, id., summary  judgment targets\n                                      \n\nshould be  secure in the knowledge  that they will  have at least\n\nten days in which to  formulate and prepare their best opposition\n\nto an impending motion.  In our view, this notice  requirement is\n\nnot mere window dressing.\n\n                                4\n\n          Sua  sponte  summary  judgments are  a  special subset.\n                     \n\nThere  are two particular  conditions precedent that  attach when\n\nthe  subset is  deployed.    First, the  discovery phase  must be\n\nsufficiently  advanced  that  the  court  can  make  an  accurate\n\ndetermination of \"whether a  genuine issue of material fact  does\n\nor  does not  exist,\" Jardines  Bacata,  878 F.2d  at 1561,  and,\n                                      \n\nrelatedly,  for  the  litigants to  know  what  material evidence\n\nlikely  can be adduced.   Second, the  target \"must  have been on\n\nnotice  to bring  forth  all  of its  evidence  on the  essential\n\nelements of the  critical claim or defense.\"  Id.   Proper notice\n                                                 \n\naffords  parties  opposing summary  judgment  the  opportunity to\n\ninform the  \"court precisely what  they intend to prove  and how,\n\nbefore [the court] can say  there are no `genuine' and `material'\n\nissues  of fact.\"   Bonilla, 843  F.2d at  37; see  generally 10A\n                                                             \n\nCharles A. Wright  et al., Federal Practice and  Procedure   2720\n                                                          \n\nat 34  (1983) (explaining  why \"great care  must be  exercised to\n\nassure   that  the  [unsuccessful  party]  has  had  an  adequate\n\nopportunity to show that  there is a genuine  issue and that  his\n\nopponent  is not  entitled to  summary  judgment as  a matter  of\n\nlaw\").\n\n          Waiver aside,2 it  is well settled in this circuit that\n\n                    \n\n     2In the summary judgment context as elsewhere, notice can be\nwaived.   See, e.g., Osbakken v.  Venable, 931 F.2d  36, 37 (10th\n                                         \nCir. 1991);  Morrison v. Washington  County, Ala., 700  F.2d 678,\n                                                 \n683  (11th Cir.),  cert. denied,  464 U.S.  864 (1983);  see also\n                                                                 \nUnited States v. Olano, 113  S. Ct. 1770, 1777 (1993) (\"Deviation\n                      \nfrom a legal rule is `error' unless the rule has  been waived.\").\nWe need not explore the  implications of waiver in this instance,\nhowever,  as  plaintiffs  objected  in a  timely  manner  to  the\nunorthodox procedure imposed by the lower court  and, thus, fully\n\n                                5\n\nall summary  judgment proceedings,  including those initiated  by\n\nthe district judge,  will be held to the  standards enunciated in\n\nRule 56 itself.   See Donate-Romero  v.  Colorado, 856  F.2d 384,\n                                                 \n\n387 (1st  Cir. 1988).   Given this  benchmark, we think  that the\n\nnotice requirement for sua sponte summary judgment demands at the\n                                 \n\nvery least  that the  parties (1) be  made aware  of the  court's\n\nintention  to mull  such an  approach,  and (2)  be afforded  the\n\nbenefit of the minimum 10-day period mandated by Rule 56.\n\n                               III\n\n          Against this  backdrop, it  is painfully  apparent that\n\nthe case  at bar comprises  an especially egregious example  of a\n\ncourt,   obviously   well   intentioned,   nonetheless   unfairly\n\nsandbagging  litigants.  When plaintiffs appeared for trial, they\n\nhad  no  inkling  that  the  judge  might  entertain,  let  alone\n\ninitiate,  a  hearing  on  summary  judgment.3   By  like  token,\n\nplaintiffs  were afforded thirty minutes, rather than the minimum\n\nperiod of ten days allotted by  Rule 56, in order to prepare  for\n\nthe hearing and  marshal their evidence  in opposition to  brevis\n                                                                 \n\ndisposition.  It  is, moreover, no sufficient answer  to say that\n\nplaintiffs  were  on  notice  to  be  prepared  for trial;  trial\n\npreparation is neither  the same as, nor an acceptable substitute\n\nfor,  the special sort of preparation, e.g., securing affidavits,\n                                           \n\nneeded to oppose a motion for summary judgment.\n\n                    \n\npreserved their rights.\n\n     3Defendants had not previously filed any dispositive motions\ndespite  the fact  that the  suit had  been pending for  over two\nyears.\n\n                                6\n\n          In  addition   to  the  flaws  already  discussed,  the\n\nprocedure employed below contained a further vice.   The \"motion\"\n\nfor summary judgment  was never reduced to writing  and, in point\n\nof  fact, was  never  fully  articulated  either  by  defendants'\n\ncounsel or by the district  judge.  It is a bedrock rule of civil\n\nlitigation  that  a  party who  has  exercised  due diligence  is\n\nentitled to be apprised of his opponent's theory of the case, and\n\nthat rule  has particular force  in the summary  judgment milieu.\n\nSee, e.g.,  D. Mass. Loc.  R. 56.1 (stipulating that  motions for\n         \n\nsummary  judgment  must  \"include  a  concise  statement  of  the\n\nmaterial facts  of record as  to which the moving  party contends\n\nthere is no  genuine issue to be tried,\"  together with paginated\n\nreferences   to  deposition   transcripts   and  other   relevant\n\ndocumentation).  The rule was flouted in this instance.\n\n                                IV\n\n          We  need go no  further.4  Sua  sponte summary judgment\n                                                \n\n                    \n\n     4We recognize that,  in some jurisdictions,  improper notice\nanent  a summary judgment  initiative may be  considered harmless\nerror, circumstances  permitting.   See, e.g.,  Powell v.  United\n                                                                 \nStates, 849  F.2d 1576,  1582 (5th  Cir. 1988)  (holding improper\n      \nnotice to be  harmless where \"the nonmoving party  admits that he\nhas  no additional evidence anyway  or . .  . the appellate court\nevaluates  all of the  nonmoving party's additional  evidence and\nfinds no  genuine issue  of material  fact\").  Assuming  arguendo\n                                                                 \nthat  we would  apply the  jurisprudence of  harmless error  in a\nconcinnous case, the doctrine would not salvage the ruling below.\nHere,  it is  virtually  impossible  to say  with  any degree  of\nconfidence  that the structural  defects in the  summary judgment\nproceeding produced an  entirely benign effect.   In combination,\nthe amorphous  character of the  motion, the lack of  notice, and\nthe   shortness  of  time  for  gathering  evidentiary  materials\nresulted in unprepared attorneys attempting  hastily to summarize\nevidence and arguing at length  with the judge about issues which\nmay  have been  only tangentially  relevant.   Consequently,  the\nabsence  of  harm cannot  be  gleaned  from  the record  and  the\n\n                                7\n\nis a remedy which, although available, must be handled with care.\n\nIn this tricky area  of the law, an undue emphasis on  speed is a\n\nsurefire  way  to  court  reversal.    So  it  is  here:   having\n\ndetermined that the proceedings below were undertaken too hastily\n\nand without a proper prophylaxis, we sustain the appeal.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.  Costs to appellants.\n                                                      \n\n                    \n\njudgment must be reversed.\n\n                                8\n",

Because the lower court employed a flawed procedural regime, we reverse its ruling, vacate the judgment, and reinstate the case for trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although defendants moved orally for summary judgment, their motion was made at the direction of the court.  Placing substance over form, we regard what transpired as the functional equivalent of a sua sponte grant of summary judgment.  To be sure, district courts possess the power to trigger summary judgment on their own initiative, see, e.g., Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v. Diaz-Marquez, 878 F.2d 1555, 1560 (1st Cir.1989), but the power is invariably tempered by the need to ensure that the parties are given adequate notice to bring forward their evidence.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986);  Jardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1561;  Bonilla v. Nazario, 843 F.2d 34, 37 (1st Cir.1988).  In this connection, we have warned that a court's power to grant summary judgment sua sponte should be used with great circumspection.  As the case before us illustrates, \"[c]ourts that yearn for the blossom when only the bud is ready act at their peril;  proceeding with unnecessary haste frequently results in more leisurely repentance.\"  Jardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1560-61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although summary judgment is a useful shortcut leading to final adjudication on the merits in a relatively small class of cases, its proper province is to weed out claims that do not warrant trial rather than simply to clear a court's docket.  To allow summary judgment, a court must find, after studying the parties' evidentiary proffers and giving the benefit of reasonable doubt to those against whom the motion is directed, that there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and that the motion's proponent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Since Rule 56 provides in part that motions for summary judgment \"shall be served at least 10 days before the time fixed for the hearing,\" and expressly allows nonmovants to \"serve opposing affidavits\" at any time prior to the day of the hearing, id., summary judgment targets should be secure in the knowledge that they will have at least ten days in which to formulate and prepare their best opposition to an impending motion.  In our view, this notice requirement is not mere window dressing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sua sponte summary judgments are a special subset.  There are two particular conditions precedent that attach when the subset is deployed.  First, the discovery phase must be sufficiently advanced that the court can make an accurate determination of \"whether a genuine issue of material fact does or does not exist,\" Jardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1561, and, relatedly, for the litigants to know what material evidence likely can be adduced.  Second, the target \"must have been on notice to bring forth all of its evidence on the essential elements of the critical claim or defense.\"  Id.  Proper notice affords parties opposing summary judgment the opportunity to inform the \"court precisely what they intend to prove and how, before [the court] can say there are no 'genuine' and 'material' issues of fact.\"  Bonilla, 843 F.2d at 37;  see generally 10A Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2720 at 34 (1983) (explaining why \"great care must be exercised to assure that the [unsuccessful party] has had an adequate opportunity to show that there is a genuine issue and that his opponent is not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Waiver aside,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> it is well settled in this circuit that all summary judgment proceedings, including those initiated by the district judge, will be held to the standards enunciated in Rule 56 itself.  See Donate-Romero v. Colorado, 856 F.2d 384, 387 (1st Cir.1988).  Given this benchmark, we think that the notice requirement for sua sponte summary judgment demands at the very least that the parties (1) be made aware of the court's intention to mull such an approach, and (2) be afforded the benefit of the minimum 10-day period mandated by Rule 56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, it is painfully apparent that the case at bar comprises an especially egregious example of a court, obviously well intentioned, nonetheless unfairly sandbagging litigants.  When plaintiffs appeared for trial, they had no inkling that the judge might entertain, let alone initiate, a hearing on summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  By like token, plaintiffs were afforded thirty minutes, rather than the minimum period of ten days allotted by Rule 56, in order to prepare for the hearing and marshal their evidence in opposition to brevis disposition.  It is, moreover, no sufficient answer to say that plaintiffs were on notice to be prepared for trial;  trial preparation is neither the same as, nor an acceptable substitute for, the special sort of preparation, e.g., securing affidavits, needed to oppose a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the flaws already discussed, the procedure employed below contained a further vice.  The \"motion\" for summary judgment was never reduced to writing and, in point of fact, was never fully articulated either by defendants' counsel or by the district judge.  It is a bedrock rule of civil litigation that a party who has exercised due diligence is entitled to be apprised of his opponent's theory of the case, and that rule has particular force in the summary judgment milieu.  See, e.g., D.Mass.Loc.R. 56.1 (stipulating that motions for summary judgment must \"include a concise statement of the material facts of record as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried,\" together with paginated references to deposition transcripts and other relevant documentation).

We need not explore the implications of waiver in this instance, however, as plaintiffs objected in a timely manner to the unorthodox procedure imposed by the lower court and, thus, fully preserved their rights</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Defendants had not previously filed any dispositive motions despite the fact that the suit had been pending for over two years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We recognize that, in some jurisdictions, improper notice anent a summary judgment initiative may be considered harmless error, circumstances permitting.  See, e.g., Powell v.

Assuming arguendo that we would apply the jurisprudence of harmless error in a concinnous case, the doctrine would not salvage the ruling below.  Here, it is virtually impossible to say with any degree of confidence that the structural defects in the summary judgment proceeding produced an entirely benign effect.  In combination, the amorphous character of the motion, the lack of notice, and the shortness of time for gathering evidentiary materials resulted in unprepared attorneys attempting hastily to summarize evidence and arguing at length with the judge about issues which may have been only tangentially relevant.  Consequently, the absence of harm cannot be gleaned from the record and the judgment must be reversed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

They brought this civil rights action in federal district court seeking, inter alia, reinstatement and money damages.  The case proceeded uneventfully through the discovery phase.  The day of trial found the parties ready for a full-dress courtroom confrontation.  But even as the attorneys surveyed prospective jurors, a visiting judge, new to the case, directed defendants to move then and there for summary judgment.  The judge accepted a perfunctory oral motion and gave the parties thirty minutes in which to prepare for argument.  Plaintiffs objected to this procedure without avail.  Following a hearing that consisted mainly of counsels' haranguing, the judge again brushed aside plaintiffs' protest anent the procedure and informed the parties that he would issue a bench decision three days later.  When the litigants appeared as ordered, a further exchange occurred, culminating in the entry of summary judgment for defendants.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we understand defendants' entreaties that we turn a blind eye to procedural irregularities and focus instead on whether the presence of genuine issues of material fact can be discerned, we decline to delve into the substantive aspects of plaintiffs' cause of action.

We need not explore the implications of waiver in this instance, however, as plaintiffs objected in a timely manner to the unorthodox procedure imposed by the lower court and, thus, fully preserved their rights</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Defendants had not previously filed any dispositive motions despite the fact that the suit had been pending for over two years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We recognize that, in some jurisdictions, improper notice anent a summary judgment initiative may be considered harmless error, circumstances permitting.  See, e.g., Powell v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508147\"><a href=\"/opinion/508147/l-earl-powell-jr-and-estate-of-lela-b-powell-deceased-l-earl/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1576</span></a></span>, 1582 (5th Cir.1988) (holding improper notice to be harmless where \"the nonmoving party admits that he has no additional evidence anyway or ... the appellate court evaluates all of the nonmoving party's additional evidence and finds no genuine issue of material fact\").  Assuming arguendo that we would apply the jurisprudence of harmless error in a concinnous case, the doctrine would not salvage the ruling below.  Here, it is virtually impossible to say with any degree of confidence that the structural defects in the summary judgment proceeding produced an entirely benign effect.  In combination, the amorphous character of the motion, the lack of notice, and the shortness of time for gathering evidentiary materials resulted in unprepared attorneys attempting hastily to summarize evidence and arguing at length with the judge about issues which may have been only tangentially relevant.  Consequently, the absence of harm cannot be gleaned from the record and the judgment must be reversed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
