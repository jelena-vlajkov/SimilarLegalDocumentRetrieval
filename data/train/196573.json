Following a two-day  trial, a jury  found\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\ndefendant-appellant  Rafael  Sarit-Rosario   (Sarit)  guilty   of\r\n\npossessing heroin  with intent to  distribute in violation  of 21\r\n\nU.S.C.   841(a)(1)  &amp; (b)(1)(C).   The district  court imposed  a\r\n\nthirty-month incarcerative sentence.  Sarit appeals.   Discerning\r\n\nno substantial question of law or fact, we summarily affirm.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r\n\n          Sarit's brief  purports to advance four  arguments, but\r\n\nthe  first  two   are  merely  variations  on   the  same  theme.\r\n\nConsequently, there are  three issues presented  on appeal.   Two\r\n\nare meritless, and  the third   on  which we make no  qualitative\r\n\njudgment   is not properly before us.\r\n\n          1.  At trial,  Sarit pinned his hopes on  an entrapment\r\n\ndefense.  Despite neglecting to move for judgment of acquittal at\r\n\nthe close of all the evidence, Fed. R. Crim. P. 29, he now argues\r\n\nthat the government  failed to  prove beyond  a reasonable  doubt\r\n\nthat it had not entrapped him.  He is wrong.\r\n\n          Once  an entrapment  defense is  properly in  play, the\r\n\ngovernment's proof must  be sufficient to  negate the claim  that\r\n\n(a) the government improperly induced the defendant to commit the\r\n\noffense, and (b) the defendant lacked a predisposition  to commit\r\n\nit.  See  United States v.  Gifford, 17 F.3d  462, 468 (1st  Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1994);  United States v. Rodriguez,  858 F.2d 809,  812 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1988).   \"[T]he  defense fails  if the  jury is  persuaded beyond\r\n\nreasonable doubt that either [element] is lacking in a particular\r                                      \r\n\ncase.\"   Rodriguez,  858 F.2d  at 815.   The  mere fact  that the\r                            \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ngovernment afforded  the defendant  an opportunity to  commit the\r\n\ncrime does not prove entrapment.  See United States v. Coady, 809\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n          On a  sufficiency challenge,  we must take  the record,\r\n\nand  all  reasonable  inferences  therefrom, in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable to the government   and we must resolve all credibility\r\n\nconflicts  in the manner most  compatible with the  verdict.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States  v. Valle,     F.3d     ,     (1st Cir.  1995) [No.\r                                 \r\n\n95-1832, slip op. at 13]; Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467.  Applying this\r                                           \r\n\nstandard, appellant's claim collapses.  If the jury believed  the\r\n\nversion  of  the  transaction  to  which  the  prosecution's  key\r\n\nwitness, Miguel Morel, testified, there was no entrapment.1\r\n\n          2.   Sarit  next challenges  the district  court's jury\r\n\ninstructions anent entrapment.   This claim, too, is procedurally\r\n\ndefaulted.   Having  failed  contemporaneously to  object to  the\r\n\ninstructions,  he can prevail only upon a showing of plain error.\r\n\nSee  United States v. Weston, 960  F.2d 212, 216 (1st Cir. 1992);\r                                      \r\n\nsee also Fed. R. Crim. P. 30, 52(b).\r                  \r\n\n          Even apart from this obvious procedural default, we see\r\n\nno error.  On appeal, Sarit asserts that the instructions did not\r\n\napprise the jury that, in order  to convict, it must find that he\r\n\nintended to commit the crimes charged prior to any contact he may\r\n\nhave  had with government  agents.  This  assertion misstates the\r\n\nlaw.  Taking the charge as a whole, see Weston, 960 F.2d at  216,\r                                                        \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1We note in passing  that Morel's testimony was corroborated\r\nin important particulars by other evidence in the record.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nwe  believe that  the  instructions  lay  out and  explicate  the\r\n\nelements of the entrapment defense with the requisite clarity and\r\n\ncompleteness.  See, e.g., Gifford, 17 F.3d at 468; Rodriguez, 858\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 812.  There was no error.\r\n\n          3.   Finally, Sarit asseverates that  his trial counsel\r\n\nprovided  him with  constitutionally deficient  representation in\r\n\nderogation of his Sixth  Amendment rights.  This claim  is raised\r\n\nfor  the first  time  on appeal.   We  decline  to entertain  it.\r\n\nAbsent  exceptional  circumstances  (most assuredly  not  present\r\n\nhere), fact-specific ineffective assistance claims not seasonably\r\n\npresented in the trial court cannot be broached on direct appeal,\r\n\nbut must be pursued collaterally by recourse to 28 U.S.C.   2255.\r\n\nSee, e.g., United  States v.  Mala, 7 F.3d  1058, 1063 (1st  Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1993) (collecting cases), cert. denied,  114 S. Ct. 1839  (1994).\r                                                \r\n\nHence, we dismiss this  claim without prejudice to Sarit's  right\r\n\nto pursue it collaterally.2\r\n\n          We need go  no further.   For the  reasons stated,  the\r\n\njudgment below is summarily\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2We do  not imply that this claim has any force.  That issue\r\nis not before us.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n",

The mere fact that the government afforded the defendant an opportunity to commit the crime does not prove entrapment.  See United States v. Coady, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481634\"><a href=\"/opinion/481634/united-states-v-neil-patrick-coady/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a sufficiency challenge, we must take the record, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the government--and we must resolve all credibility conflicts in the manner most compatible with the verdict.

Applying this standard, appellant's claim collapses.   If the jury believed the version of the transaction to which the prosecution's key witness, Miguel Morel, testified, there was no entrapment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Sarit next challenges the district court's jury instructions anent entrapment.   This claim, too, is procedurally defaulted.   Having failed contemporaneously to object to the instructions, he can prevail only upon a showing of plain error.  See United States v. Weston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580695\"><a href=\"/opinion/580695/united-states-v-albert-weston-united-states-of-america-v-paul-r-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 216 (1st Cir.1992);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even apart from this obvious procedural default, we see no error.   On appeal, Sarit asserts that the instructions did not apprise the jury that, in order to convict, it must find that he intended to commit the crimes charged prior to any contact he may have had with government agents.   This assertion misstates the law.   Taking the charge as a whole, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580695\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Weston,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/580695/united-states-v-albert-weston-united-states-of-america-v-paul-r-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, we believe that the instructions lay out and explicate the elements of the entrapment defense with the requisite clarity and completeness.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Gifford,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>;  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512578\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rodriguez,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/512578/united-states-v-felix-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>.

Finally, Sarit asseverates that his trial counsel provided him with constitutionally deficient representation in derogation of his Sixth Amendment rights.   This claim is raised for the first time on appeal.   We decline to entertain it.   Absent exceptional circumstances (most assuredly not present here), fact-specific ineffective assistance claims not seasonably presented in the trial court cannot be broached on direct appeal, but must be pursued collaterally by recourse to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.  See, e.g., United States v. Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1839</span> </span>(1994).   Hence, we dismiss this claim without prejudice to Sarit's right to pursue it collaterally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
