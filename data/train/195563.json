Plaintiff  appeals the denial of leave\n                    \n\nto amend his civil rights complaint.  We affirm.\n\n           The events  leading to the  denial of  plaintiff's\n\nmotion  for   leave  to  amend  are,   briefly,  as  follows.\n\nPlaintiff's  complaint  initially  asserted  claims  under 42\n\nU.S.C.   1983, and state law, against five defendants.  After\n\na  screening  by  the  magistrate  revealed  defects  in  the\n\nstatement  of some of  the claims, plaintiff  was afforded an\n\nopportunity  to amend  or face  a dismissal of  the defective\n\nclaims. Plaintiff chose not to amend  at that time, resulting\n\nin dismissal of the case against three of the defendants.\n\n          The  remaining two  defendants  were  the  Town  of\n\nBennington, New  Hampshire, and David E.  Mancini, the Town's\n\nChief of Police.   The federal claims against them  fell into\n\ntwo groups.   First, there  were claims  stemming from  Chief\n\nMancini's alleged failure to obtain a search warrant prior to\n\nconducting  a  search  of  plaintiff's  property.     Second,\n\nplaintiff  claimed that  Mancini, acting  in the  capacity of\n\ntown  prosecutor, wrongfully initiated and prosecuted certain\n\nmisdemeanor charges against plaintiff.  \n\n          At a pretrial conference  in July, 1993, defendants\n\nindicated  that  they expected  to  file  a summary  judgment\n\nmotion on various grounds.   The district judge set September\n\n15,  1993 as  the  last  date for  the  filing of  a  summary\n\njudgment motion, and  December 15, 1993  as the closing  date\n\nfor discovery.  \n\n          Defendants  filed  their  summary judgment  motion,\n\nreplete with affidavits and  exhibits, on the scheduled date.\n\nPlaintiff offered voluminous materials in opposition, much of\n\nit irrelevant.  Summary judgment was awarded to defendants on\n\na  showing that in fact Mancini had obtained a facially valid\n\nsearch warrant from a neutral and detached  state judge prior\n\nto the challenged search.  As to the  second group of claims,\n\nMancini was insulated from civil liability by the doctrine of\n\nabsolute prosecutorial immunity, see Buckley  v. Fitzsimmons,\n                                                            \n\n113 S. Ct. 2606, 2615 (1993), and there were no facts showing\n\nthat the  Town had  pursued  an unlawful  policy or  practice\n\ncausally  related  to  any  constitutional  violation.    The\n\npendent   state   claims   were   simultaneously   dismissed.\n\nPlaintiff does not  here renew his  challenge to the  summary\n\njudgment.  \n\n          Plaintiff  filed the  subject motion to  amend nine\n\ndays after  defendants filed  their summary judgment  motion.\n\nThe  amendment was apparently designed to avoid the thrust of\n\ndefendants' summary  judgment arguments.  It  added three new\n\nfederal  claims based on the  new premise that  even if there\n\nwas a  warrant for the  search, the underlying  affidavit was\n\nfalse  and  the  warrant  invalid.   In  addition,  plaintiff\n\n                             -3-\n\nincluded constitutional challenges to the manner in which the\n\nsearch and arrest were effected. \n\n          A  decision to grant or  deny a motion  to amend is\n\ncommitted  to  the  sound  discretion  of  the  trial  court.\n\nColmenares Vivas  v. Sun  Alliance Ins.  Co., 807  F.2d 1102,\n                                            \n\n1108 (1st Cir.  1986).  It will be disturbed  only on a clear\n\nshowing of  abuse, meaning that \"no  sufficient justification\n\nappears.\"   Correa-Martinez  v. Arrillaga-Belendez,  903 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n49, 59 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing Foman v.  Davis, 371 U.S. 178,\n                                              \n\n182 (1962)); accord Clair Recreation Ctr., Inc. v.

While Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) provides that \"leave to\n\namend shall be  freely given when  justice so requires,\"  the\n\ncourt need not \"grant every request to amend, come what may.\"\n\nCorrea-Martinez,  903 F.2d  at  59; Colmenares,  807 F.2d  at\n                                              \n\n1108.     Rather  the  court   may,  indeed  must,  give  due\n\nconsideration to  factors such  as the substantive  merits of\n\nthe amendment,  the need to  prevent undue delay,  bad faith,\n\nand prejudice to  the opposing  party.  Foman  v. Davis,  371\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 178, 182 (1962).\n\n          We see  no abuse here.   The magistrate  found that\n\nwhile the  amendments might  not be substantively  futile, on\n\nbalance leave to amend should be denied because,\n\n     The delay exercised by plaintiff is significant, as\n     he filed  the motion  after defendants  filed their\n     motion for summary  judgment.  Plaintiff  was aware\n     of the factual  allegations underlying these claims\n\n                             -4-\n\n     when    the    original   complaint    was   filed.\n     Furthermore,   this  case   is  ready   for  trial.\n     Allowing leave  to amend to add  new legal theories\n     at this  time would likely require  the retaking of\n     several depositions and other discovery delays.\n\nOrder  at 3-4 (Feb. 18,  1994).  The  district court affirmed\n\nthe magistrate's  decision.  While plaintiff correctly points\n\nout that when  he filed  his motion to  amend, the  discovery\n\nclosing date  was actually  several weeks  away,1 we find  no\n\nfault with the balance struck by the magistrate.  \n\n          The amendment offered substantially different legal\n\ntheories  and  raised  new  factual  issues at  a  time  when\n\ndefendants   had   already   finished   their   own  pretrial\n\npreparation.   Plaintiff had delayed in  filing the amendment\n\nfor almost two months after the pretrial conference at  which\n\nthe substance of  defendant's objections had been  aired.  In\n\nthe meantime, defendants  had prepared for summary  judgment,\n\nand possibly  a trial,  on the  basis of plaintiff's  initial\n\ntheories.           Plaintiff's explanation for his delay was\n\nthat he  had misplaced his previous attorney's notes.  Though\n\nwe do not gainsay  the magistrate's finding of no  bad faith,\n\nnevertheless plaintiff knew the basis for the claims from the\n\noutset,  and had already pleaded two of them in a state civil\n\n                    \n\n1.  There was  still pending a motion by  plaintiff to compel\ndiscovery.    The  magistrate  was also  mistaken  about  the\nretaking of depositions, since  apparently neither party  had\n  \nnoticed any depositions.   This too,  is of marginal  import,\nthe material point being that the amendment raised new issues\nthat  would  have  required  additional  discovery, including\ndepositions.  \n\n                             -5-\n\nsuit  which  he was  simultaneously pursuing.   A  perusal of\n\nplaintiff's various  filings shows too, that  despite his pro\n                                                             \n\nse status, he is adept at pleading and motion practice.\n  \n\n          Finding no abuse of discretion in the lower court's\n\ndetermination  that it  would have  been unjust  to belatedly\n\nburden  the  defendants with  new  discovery  and delay,  the\n\njudgment below is affirmed.    \n                           \n\n                             -6-\n",

The amendment was apparently designed to avoid the thrust of defendants' summary judgment arguments.  It added three new federal claims based on the new premise that even if there was a warrant for the search, the underlying affidavit was false and the warrant invalid.  In addition, plaintiff included constitutional challenges to the manner in which the search and arrest were effected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decision to grant or deny a motion to amend is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.

Rather the court may, indeed must, give due consideration to factors such as the substantive merits of the amendment, the need to prevent undue delay, bad faith, and prejudice to the opposing party.   Foman v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 182 (1962).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no abuse here.  The magistrate found that while the amendments might not be substantively futile, on balance leave to amend should be denied because,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The delay exercised by plaintiff is significant, as he filed the motion after defendants filed their motion for summary judgment.  Plaintiff was aware of the factual allegations underlying these claims when the original complaint was filed.  Furthermore, this case is ready for trial.  Allowing leave to amend to add new legal theories at this time would likely require the retaking of several depositions and other discovery delays.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Order at 3-4 (Feb. 18, 1994).  The district court affirmed the magistrate's decision.  While plaintiff correctly points out that when he filed his motion to amend, the discovery closing date was actually several weeks away,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> we find no fault with the balance struck by the magistrate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amendment offered substantially different legal theories and raised new factual issues at a time when defendants had already finished their own pretrial preparation.  Plaintiff had delayed in filing the amendment for almost two months after the pretrial conference at which the substance of defendant's objections had been aired.  In the meantime, defendants had prepared for summary judgment, and possibly a trial, on the basis of plaintiff's initial theories.  Plaintiff's explanation for his delay was that he had misplaced his previous attorney's notes.  Though we do not gainsay the magistrate's finding of no bad faith, nevertheless plaintiff knew the basis for the claims from the outset, and had already pleaded two of them in a state civil suit which he was simultaneously pursuing.  A perusal of plaintiff's various filings shows too, that despite his pro se status, he is adept at pleading and motion practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no abuse of discretion in the lower court's determination that it would have been unjust to belatedly burden the defendants with new discovery and delay, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There was still pending a motion by plaintiff to compel discovery.  The magistrate was also mistaken about the re taking of depositions, since apparently neither party had noticed any depositions.  This too, is of marginal import, the material point being that the amendment raised new issues that would have required additional discovery, including depositions</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
