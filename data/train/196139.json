On September  9, 1993,  after a  one-night\r                           \r\n\nstay  in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the claimant Gloria Echeverry\r\n\npassed  through the  security  checkpoint at  the Luis  Munoz\r\n\nMarin International Airport on  her way to board a  flight to\r\n\nMiami, Florida.  A private security guard viewed the first of\r\n\nEcheverry's two carry-on bags as it passed through  the X-ray\r\n\nmachine.   The guard's suspicion  was aroused by a mysterious\r\n\nshape in the first bag; the guard asked Echeverry whether the\r\n\nbag was hers, and Echeverry replied in the affirmative. \r\n\n     The guard  opened the first carry-on  bag and discovered\r\n\nlarge amounts of cash wrapped in four towels.  The guard then\r\n\nsummoned a Puerto Rico police officer, who in turn eventually\r\n\ncalled DEA  agents to the scene.  The second carry-on bag was\r\n\nalso searched  and found to  contain cash wrapped  in towels;\r\n\ntogether  the  bags  contained  $200,226.00.   The  cash  was\r\n\nretained  by the DEA, and Echeverry was allowed to leave with\r\n\na receipt for the money.\r\n\n     Virtually everything else  that occurred at  the airport\r\n\nis  disputed.     Pertinently,  the  government  claims  that\r\n\nEcheverry consented to a search of both bags.  The government\r\n\nalso says  that Echeverry voluntarily provided  police with a\r\n\nremarkable story about the source of the money:  according to\r\n\nthe  prosecutors, she stated that the $200,000 was a gift out\r\n\nof  the  blue  from  her  wealthy  Italian  boyfriend,  whose\r\n\naddress, telephone number and occupation were unknown to her,\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nand was delivered to her in a brown paper bag  by a stranger.\r\n\n     On the other hand, Echeverry denies ever consenting to a\r\n\nsearch  of  her bags  and  says she  was  detained, isolated,\r\n\ninterrogated,  and that  prior to  her alleged  detention she\r\n\nmade no statement whatever about the origin of the cash.  She\r\n\nsays that she was told by the police of their general  policy\r\n\nto detain persons carrying  cash and that she was  ordered to\r\n\nremain  in  a  separate location  until  the  DEA  arrived to\r\n\ninterrogate her.\r\n\n     On January  20, 1994,  the United States  filed a  civil\r\n\nforfeiture complaint against the money in the district court,\r\n\nalleging  that the  cash was the  proceeds of or  was used in\r\n\nconnection with drug trafficking.  See 21 U.S.C.   881(a)(6).\r                                                  \r\n\nOn February 25, 1994,  Echeverry filed a claim to  the seized\r\n\ncash.  On March  8, 1994, she filed a motion to dismiss.  She\r\n\nsubsequently  filed a  motion,  and supporting  affidavit, to\r\n\nsuppress  much of  the evidence  on the  ground that  the law\r\n\nenforcement agents had obtained  her statements and  physical\r\n\nevidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\r\n\n     On July 12,  1994, the district judge  issued an opinion\r\n\nand order denying  the claimant's motions  to dismiss and  to\r\n\nsuppress and  directing Echeverry  to show cause  why summary\r\n\njudgment should  not  be  entered  for the  government.    In\r\n\nresponse  to the  court's  sua sponte  order, the  government\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nmoved  for  entry of  forfeiture judgment  on July  14, 1994.\r\n\nEcheverry filed her response on August 4, 1994.  The district\r\n\ncourt entered an  order on September 23,  1994, again denying\r\n\nthe  claimant's dismissal  and suppression  motions, granting\r\n\nsummary  judgment   for  the   United  States  and   ordering\r\n\nforfeiture of the money.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n     The  chief issue in this  appeal is the district court's\r\n\nresolution of contested factual disputes  on summary judgment\r\n\nwithout an  evidentiary hearing.  In deciding that the search\r\n\nand  resulting  statements at  the  airport  were legal,  the\r\n\ndistrict  judge relied explicitly on the government's version\r\n\nof  the  facts.    Pertinently, the  opinion  stated  without\r\n\nqualification  that  Echeverry provided  the  boyfriend story\r\n\nvoluntarily and that she \"was  never detained by the security\r\n\npersonnel, local police officer [sic] or DEA agents\" and \"was\r\n\nfree  to leave at her will.\"   Then, in ruling that there was\r\n\nprobable  cause to believe that  the cash was  linked to drug\r\n\ntrafficking,  the   district  judge  relied   on  Echeverry's\r\n\nexplanation of how she received the cash.\r\n\n     In  concluding that  Echeverry was  never detained,  the\r\n\ndistrict court cited  to the affidavits of  three officers or\r\n\nagents.  Acknowledging that  Echeverry had filed an affidavit\r\n\n\"contradicting\"  those of the  government, the district court\r\n\nsaid that  Echeverry's affidavit was  \"self-serving\" and  did\r\n\n\"not  create an  issue  of  fact  so  as  to  defeat  summary\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\njudgment.\"  Her affidavit  is certainly self-serving, as most\r\n\nlitigation affidavits  are, but it goes  somewhat beyond mere\r\n\nconclusion and  is undeniably  at odds with  the government's\r\n\nversion.  Her affidavit said in part:\r\n\n     [After the  luggage  was opened]  Officer  Carreras\r\n     told  me  that  I  would be  detained  pending  the\r\n     arrival of  the DEA.  Officer  Carreras stated that\r\n     it  was  their policy  to  detain  anyone who  came\r\n     through  the airport  carrying money.   Upon  being\r\n     told that  I would  be  detained, Officer  Carreras\r\n     picked up my two pieces  of luggage and ordered  me\r\n     to  follow him  to a  small room  where I  was held\r\n     until  the arrival  of  the DEA.    Prior to  being\r\n     detained, I made no statement concerning the origin\r\n     of the money in my possession.\r\n\n     A  determination of  whose version  of events  should be\r\n\nbelieved  clearly  cannot  be  made  without  an  evidentiary\r\n\nhearing  of some  kind.   Neither  of  the versions  of  what\r\n\nhappened   at   the   airport   was   inherently  incredible;\r\n\nEcheverry's  version  was  squarely  supported by  her  sworn\r\n\naffidavit.   Under these circumstances, we do not see how the\r\n\ndistrict court could determine  that the factual issues could\r\n\nbe resolved  in the  government's favor without  hearing from\r\n\nlive  witnesses  and  giving  Echeverry  the  opportunity  to\r\n\ntestify in open court.   See, e.g., United States  v. Taylor,\r                                                                        \r\n\n13  F.3d 786 (4th Cir. 1994); United States v. Berkowitz, 927\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1376, 1385  (7th Cir.  1991), cert. denied,  113 S.

See One  1958 Plymouth Sedan  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nPennsylvania,  380 U.S. 693, 696 (1965).  Further, the use of\r                        \r\n\nEcheverry's unusual  account of  how she received  the funds,\r\n\nand her professed ignorance  of information about her alleged\r\n\nboyfriend, played  an important role in  the district court's\r\n\ndetermination that the property was subject to forfeit.\r\n\n     The judgment of  the district court  is vacated and  the\r                                                                \r\n\nmatter is remanded for  further proceedings.  Without seeking\r                              \r\n\nto  prescribe the  course of  the proceedings  on remand,  we\r\n\nthink  that the district court  might be well  advised in due\r\n\ncourse  to hold  an  evidentiary hearing  to determine  whose\r\n\nversion of the airport events is correct before attempting to\r\n\nresolve either the suppression or the forfeiture issues.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r                                 \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n",

Gloria<br>Isabel Echeverry Berrio Bueno Monsalve, Claimant, Appellant.</p>\n    <p class=\"docket\">No. 94-2228</p>\n    <p class=\"court\">United States Court of Appeals,<br>First Circuit.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">June 13, 1995</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jose Vazquez, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, was on briefs for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.Puerto Rico</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA, BOUDIN and LYNCH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 9, 1993, after a one-night stay in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the claimant Gloria Echeverry passed through the security checkpoint at the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport on her way to board a flight to Miami, Florida.  A private security guard viewed the first of Echeverry's two carry-on bags as it passed through the X-ray machine.  The guard's suspicion was aroused by a mysterious shape in the first bag;  the guard asked Echeverry whether the bag was hers, and Echeverry replied in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guard opened the first carry-on bag and discovered large amounts of cash wrapped in four towels.  The guard then summoned a Puerto Rico police officer, who in turn eventually called DEA agents to the scene.  The second carry-on bag was also searched and found to contain cash wrapped in towels;  together the bags contained $200,226.00.  The cash was retained by the DEA, and Echeverry was allowed to leave with a receipt for the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually everything else that occurred at the airport is disputed.  Pertinently, the government claims that Echeverry consented to a search of both bags.  The government also says that Echeverry voluntarily provided police with a remarkable story about the source of the money:  according to the prosecutors, she stated that the $200,000 was a gift out of the blue from her wealthy Italian boyfriend, whose address, telephone number and occupation were unknown to her, and was delivered to her in a brown paper bag by a stranger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, Echeverry denies ever consenting to a search of her bags and says she was detained, isolated, interrogated, and that prior to her alleged detention she made no statement whatever about the origin of the cash.  She says that she was told by the police of their general policy to detain persons carrying cash and that she was ordered to remain in a separate location until the DEA arrived to interrogate her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1994, the United States filed a civil forfeiture complaint against the money in the district court, alleging that the cash was the proceeds of or was used in connection with drug trafficking.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(a)(6).  On February 25, 1994, Echeverry filed a claim to the seized cash.  On March 8, 1994, she filed a motion to dismiss.  She subsequently filed a motion, and supporting affidavit, to suppress much of the evidence on the ground that the law enforcement agents had obtained her statements and physical evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, 1994, the district judge issued an opinion and order denying the claimant's motions to dismiss and to suppress and directing Echeverry to show cause why summary judgment should not be entered for the government.  In response to the court's sua sponte order, the government moved for entry of forfeiture judgment on July 14, 1994.  Echeverry filed her response on August 4, 1994.  The district court entered an order on September 23, 1994, again denying the claimant's dismissal and suppression motions, granting summary judgment for the United States and ordering forfeiture of the money.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chief issue in this appeal is the district court's resolution of contested factual disputes on summary judgment without an evidentiary hearing.  In deciding that the search and resulting statements at the airport were legal, the district judge relied explicitly on the government's version of the facts.  Pertinently, the opinion stated without qualification that Echeverry provided the boyfriend story voluntarily and that she \"was never detained by the security personnel, local police officer [sic] or DEA agents\" and \"was free to leave at her will.\"  Then, in ruling that there was probable cause to believe that the cash was linked to drug trafficking, the district judge relied on Echeverry's explanation of how she received the cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that Echeverry was never detained, the district court cited to the affidavits of three officers or agents.  Acknowledging that Echeverry had filed an affidavit \"contradicting\" those of the government, the district court said that Echeverry's affidavit was \"self-serving\" and did \"not create an issue of fact so as to defeat summary judgment.\"  Her affidavit is certainly self-serving, as most litigation affidavits are, but it goes somewhat beyond mere conclusion and is undeniably at odds with the government's version.  Her affidavit said in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[After the luggage was opened] Officer Carreras told me that I would be detained pending the arrival of the DEA.  Officer Carreras stated that it was their policy to detain anyone who came through the airport carrying money.  Upon being told that I would be detained, Officer Carreras picked up my two pieces of luggage and ordered me to follow him to a small room where I was held until the arrival of the DEA.  Prior to being detained, I made no statement concerning the origin of the money in my possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A determination of whose version of events should be believed clearly cannot be made without an evidentiary hearing of some kind.  Neither of the versions of what happened at the airport was inherently incredible;  Echeverry's version was squarely supported by her sworn affidavit.  Under these circumstances, we do not see how the district court could determine that the factual issues could be resolved in the government's favor without hearing from live witnesses and giving Echeverry the opportunity to testify in open court.  See, e.g., United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660199\"><a href=\"/opinion/660199/no-93-1470/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span> </a></span>(4th Cir. 1994);  United States v. Berkowitz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557342\"><a href=\"/opinion/557342/united-states-v-marvin-berkowitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1376</span></a></span>, 1385 (7th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span> </span>(1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Echeverry was in fact detained involuntarily by the police, held in isolation for a substantial period, given no Miranda warning, and then made statements that are potentially quite damaging, there are at least colorable issues raised as to whether the statements could be used in the forfeiture proceeding.  See One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107043\"><a href=\"/opinion/107043/one-1958-plymouth-sedan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, 696 (1965).  Further, the use of Echeverry's unusual account of how she received the funds, and her professed ignorance of information about her alleged boyfriend, played an important role in the district court's determination that the property was subject to forfeit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.  Without seeking to prescribe the course of the proceedings on remand, we think that the district court might be well advised in due course to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whose version of the airport events is correct before attempting to resolve either the suppression or the forfeiture issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
