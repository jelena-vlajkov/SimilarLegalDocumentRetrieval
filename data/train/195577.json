Claimant Florence  Edwards appeals  a\n                    \n\ndistrict court order affirming a decision of the Secretary of\n\nHealth  and  Human  Services  that  denies  social   security\n\ndisability benefits.  We affirm.\n\n          The background facts are thoroughly detailed in the\n\ndecisions below.  Briefly,  claimant alleges a disability due\n\nto  injuries she  sustained on  February 28,  1988,  when she\n\njumped from  a second  story window  to escape  a fire.   She\n\nsuffered significant  fractures to both feet  and a fractured\n\nvertebrae.    After  a month  in  the  hospital and  physical\n\ntherapy on an outpatient basis, she returned to her work at a\n\nshoe company  in September, 1988.   Adjustments were  made in\n\nher work duties to  accommodate her new mobility limitations,\n\nand  she  remained  at her  job  until  the  plant closed  in\n\nDecember,  1988.    For  a  period  thereafter  she  accepted\n\nunemployment  benefits.    In  April, 1989  she  underwent  a\n\nsubtalor fusion of the  left foot.  At the time  the treating\n\northopedist  noted that as a result of her fractures her feet\n\nwere  significantly deformed,  with residual  arthritis.   In\n\nJuly,  1990, a similar  subtalor fusion was  performed on her\n\nright foot.   It is  not disputed that  claimant relies on  a\n\ncane, walks with difficulty, and apparently suffers permanent\n\nlimitations on  her ambulatory  abilities.  She  also suffers\n\nfrom hypertension and obesity, and complains of chronic lower\n\nback pain.  \n\n                             -2-\n\n          There  were two  hearings before  an Administrative\n\nLaw Judge  (ALJ)  on claimant's  application  for  disability\n\nbenefits.   Claimant was represented  by the same  counsel at\n\nboth hearings.   A decision denying benefits  after the first\n\nhearing was  vacated by the  Appeals Council, and  the matter\n\nremanded to  the ALJ for  the taking  of additional  evidence\n\nrelating to claimant's post- operative condition.  The second\n\nhearing also resulted in a decision to deny benefits, and the\n\nAppeals  Council  denied review.    On  cross-motions by  the\n\nparties, the district court affirmed the Secretary's decision\n\nin a lengthy memorandum opinion. \n\n          The  ALJ's  second   decision  found  claimant  not\n\ndisabled  at step  five of  the familiar  sequential analytic\n\nprocess, in that  claimant had a residual functional capacity\n\nto perform a limited range of unskilled sedentary  jobs which\n\nexist in  significant numbers  in the  national economy.   20\n\nC.F.R.     404.1520(f), 404.1561, 404.1566.   Claimant renews\n\nin this  court several of  the multiple assignments  of error\n\nshe urged below, and attempts to add a new one  for the first\n\ntime on appeal.               First   claimant   argues,   as\n\nbelow,  that the  ALJ failed  to develop  an adequate  record\n\nrelating  to  her residual  functional  capacity,  because he\n\nviolated an \"explicit order from  the Appeals Council to have\n\nthe examining physician [Dr.  Shea] complete a specific form.\n\n. . \"  According to claimant, Dr. Shea should have filled out\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe very same  preprinted form  that was  used by  claimant's\n\ntreating doctor, Dr. Wachs.\n\n          Claimant's reading  of the Appeals  Council's order\n\nis questionable,1  but we  need  not tarry  over this  detail\n\nbecause the record developed below  is clearly adequate.  The\n\nALJ had before him  a thorough residual functional assessment\n\nfrom Dr.  Wachs, who was associated  with claimant's treating\n\northopedist.   In  addition,  there was  a full  consultative\n\nexamination  by Dr.  Shea,  who was  also  familiar with  the\n\nclaimant, having  evaluated her in  connection with  previous\n\napplications.      Dr.   Shea's   report   contains  detailed\n\nassessments  of   appellant's  range  of   motion,  reflexes,\n\nflexion,  walking, sitting,  and  standing  abilities.   Both\n\ndoctors  reported  substantial   limitations  on   claimant's\n\nfunctional abilities,  reducing the  range of work  which she\n\nmight perform to less  than the full range of  sedentary jobs\n\navailable.\n\n          It  is true  that the  two doctors' reports  are in\n\ndifferent formats, but we  fail to see any prejudice  in this\n\n                    \n\n1.    The Appeals Council instructed  the ALJ to obtain, with\nthe  cooperation  of  claimant's attorney,  medical  evidence\nrelating to claimant's post-operative condition,  \n     [F]rom   the   claimant's  treating   sources   .  .   .\n     a medical assessment  of the claimant's ability  to\n     perform  work-related  activities (20  CFR 404.1513\n     and  416.913).   Further the  [ALJ] will  obtain an\n     orthopedic consultative examination with  a medical\n     assessment  in order  to  resolve the  [severity of\n     claimant's limitations]. \n\n                             -4-\n\nasymmetry.    Each  report formed  the  basis  of a  separate\n\nhypothetical question  propounded  to the  vocational  expert\n\n(VE).   The VE  identified approximately  67,500 jobs  in the\n\nnational economy  which claimant  might  perform despite  the\n\nfunctional  limitations reported  by Dr.  Wachs,  and 135,000\n\njobs despite  the limitations observed  by Dr.  Shea.2   Even\n\nthe  lower of  these two  estimates sufficed  to  satisfy the\n\nSecretary's  burden  of  showing  \"significant   numbers\"  of\n\nsuitable jobs  in the national economy. 20 C.F.R.   404.1566;\n\nsee  also Keating v. Secretary of HHS, 848 F.2d 271, 276 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.  1988) (to show that work exists in significant numbers,\n\nthe Secretary must show significant, not isolated, numbers of\n\njobs which a claimant can perform).3  \n\n                    \n\n2.   The numbers in the text are the adjusted totals computed\nby the ALJ.   The ALJ adjusted the VE's raw  figures downward\nusing  percentage  decreases  which  the VE  had  said  would\naccount for claimant's various  limitations.  Our own reading\nof the transcript suggests that the ALJ's adjusted figure may\nbe  lower than the VE intended, as we glimpse the possibility\nof a double deduction, but since any mistake is in claimant's\nfavor, we need not explore the matter further.  \n\n3.   While  claimant urges  that the meaning  of \"significant\nnumbers\"  varies with the facts  of each case,  she points to\nnothing that might diminish the significance of the very high\nnumbers  in her case.  Her claim that her disability prevents\nher  from  driving  is   somewhat  contradicted  by  her  own\ntestimony, and her alternate  contention that there is little\npublic transportation  is  irrelevant.    See  Lopez-Diaz  v.\n                                                         \nSecretary of HEW, 585 F.2d 1137, 1140-42 (1st Cir. 1978).  We\n                \nalso do  not consider claimant's contentions  relating to the\n\"significance\"  of  the smaller  numbers given  by the  VE in\nresponse to hypotheticals which  were based on the claimant's\nsubjective complaints, because the VE found those  complaints\nnot credible.  \n\n                             -5-\n\n          Since  the  ALJ's   conclusion  finds   substantial\n\nsupport in  the  treating doctor's,  Dr. Wach's,  assessment,\n\nclaimant's fallback argument that the ALJ substituted his own\n\nopinion for that of Dr. Shea is irrelevant, and in any event,\n\nrests on  a strained reading of the record.  It is clear that\n\nclaimant suffered no prejudice from the format of  Dr. Shea's\n\nreport.\n\n          Second,  claimant  argues  that  the  ALJ  did  not\n\nproperly evaluate  her subjective complaints of pain.  On our\n\nown review, we  agree with  the district court  that the  ALJ\n\ngave  full  and  careful  consideration  to  claimant's  pain\n\ncomplaints in  conformity with the regulations  and case law.\n\nSee Avery  v. Secretary  of HHS,  797 F.2d 19,  21 (1st  Cir.\n                               \n\n1986).  The record  does not support the contention  that the\n\nALJ gave  undue weight to claimant's  use of non-prescription\n\npain medications.    We  defer to  the  ALJ's  assessment  of\n\nclaimant's  credibility, especially  as  it was  supported by\n\nspecific findings.  See  Frustaglia v. Secretary of HHS,  829\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n          Third,  claimant  argues,  for the  first  time  on\n\nappeal, that  there was insufficient evidence  because the VE\n\n\"mischaracterized,\"  as  exertionally sedentary,  the various\n\njobs he identified  as available to a  person with claimant's\n\ncharacteristics.   The VE testified  that \"some\" jobs  in the\n\nfollowing  categories would  be suitable:   machine operation\n\n                             -6-\n\njobs,  such  as  grinding,  buffing   and  polishing;  manual\n\nassembler; inspector; and cashier/ticket seller.    \n\n          In  her  appellate  brief,  claimant  assigns  code\n\nnumbers  to  these job  titles  based on  information  in the\n\nDictionary  of  Occupational  Titles (revised  4th  ed. 1991)\n\n(DOT).   All  of  the  code numbers  which  claimant  assigns\n\ncorrespond to jobs  which the DOT  classifies as requiring  a\n\ngreater than \"sedentary\" \n\nexertional  capacity, and  in one  instance, a  greater skill\n\nlevel than claimant possesses.4   \n\n          The VE, however, did not assign DOT code numbers in\n\nhis  testimony, only  general  job titles.    While the  code\n\nnumbers  affixed by  claimant  refer to  similar job  titles,\n\nthere are   numerous DOT listings  with superficially similar\n\ntitles, or work descriptions, some of which are classified as\n\nsedentary and  unskilled.5   Claimant's point thus  cannot be\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  code numbers  and corresponding  titles assigned  by\nclaimant  are:  sanding machine  buffer,  D.O.T. 662.685-022;\npolisher, D.O.T. 705.684-058; polisher  and buffer II, D.O.T.\n705.684-062; grinder, D.O.T. 555.685-026; grinder  II, D.O.T.\n603.664-010; assembler, small  products, D.O.T.  706-684-022;\nproduction  assembler,  D.O.T.   706-687-010;  inspector   of\nplastics  and composites, D.O.T.  806.261-046; ticket seller,\nD.O.T. 211.467-030; cashier  II, D.O.T. 211.462-010;  cashier\nI, D.O.T. 211.362.010.\n\n5.  For  example, the  DOT classifies  the following  jobs as\nexertionally sedentary, and requiring no more than 0-3 months\nof vocational preparation: check cashier, D.O.T. 211.462-026;\ncashier, tube room, 211.482.010; pricer, message and delivery\nservice,  214.467-014;  tax  clerk,  219.487-010;  scheduler,\n238.367-034;   heel  sorter,  788.584-010.     Moreover,  the\nSecretary's   Medical-Vocational   Guidelines,  which   takes\n\n                             -7-\n\nreadily verified  by simply comparing some  DOT listings with\n\nthe VE's testimony.\n\n          In other circumstances,  the uncertainty  generated\n\nby claimant's  observations might  cause concern.   While not\n\nthe only  reliable source  of job information,  the Secretary\n\ntakes  administrative notice  of  the accuracy  of the  DOT's\n\ngeneralized job  descriptions. See  20 C.F.R.    404.1566(d),\n                                  \n\nSubpart  P, app.  2,    200.00(b).   The Secretary  bears the\n\nburden of proving the  existence of jobs in the  economy that\n\nthe claimant can  perform.   See Goodermote  v. Secretary  of\n                                                             \n\nHHS,  690 F.2d  5,  7 (1st  Cir. 1982).    A clear  dichotomy\n   \n\nbetween the DOT and the VE's testimony on this point may call\n\ninto question the sufficiency of the Secretary's evidence.\n\n          Courts have vacated the Secretary's decisions where\n\nthe VE's testimony is contradicted in its entirety by the DOT\n\nand the only reasonable  explanation seems to be that  the VE\n\nmade a mistake.   See, e.g., Young  v. Secretary of HHS,  957\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  386,   392  (7th  Cir.  1992)  (VE's  testimony  as  to\n\ncharacteristics of claimant's  former jobs inconsistent  with\n\nDOT description);  Ellison v. Sullivan, 921  F.2d 816, 821-22\n                                      \n\n                    \n\nadministrative  notice  of  the  numbers  of  jobs  generally\navailable  in  the  economy,   reports  the  existence  of  a\nsignificant range of sedentary work available to a person  of\nclaimant's  age  (36)  and  skills  (unskilled).  20  C.F.R.,\nSubpart  P, app.  2,  Table  No. 1,  Rule  201.24.   The  ALJ\nproperly used the guidelines  only as a \"frame  of reference\"\nhere  because the  claimant  cannot perform  a full  range of\nsedentary  activity.   20  C.F.R.,  Subpart  P,   app.  2,   \n200.00(d); 20 C.F.R.   404.1569. \n\n                             -8-\n\n(8th Cir. 1990) (claimant limited to sedentary work, all jobs\n\nlisted by  VE rated as light  to heavy); Tom  v. Heckler, 779\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1250,  1255-56, 1257  n.12  (7th  Cir. 1985)  (claimant\n\nlimited to sedentary  work; all  jobs listed by  VE rated  as\n\nlight);  Mimms v. Heckler, 750  F.2d 180, 186  (2d Cir. 1984)\n                         \n\n(same).  In at least one of the cases, Tom, the court treated\n                                          \n\nan irreconcilable conflict as  the equivalent of plain error,\n\nremanding  despite  the failure  of  the  claimant to  object\n\nbelow.  \n\n          Here,  however,   not  only  is   the  alleged  DOT\n\ncontradiction  uncertain,  but the  circumstances surrounding\n\nclaimant's failure to object at the hearing suggest that this\n\nuncertainty is better  explained by hindsight  interpretation\n\nthan  by  actual error.    Claimant  was represented  at  the\n\nhearing by  an experienced attorney, who  evinced no surprise\n\nor  confusion at  the VE's  testimony.   On the  contrary, he\n\ncomplimented the VE on  the thoroughness of his presentation.\n\nThe attorney  was keenly aware that a discrepancy between the\n\nVE's articulation and  the DOT  might be  used to  claimant's\n\nadvantage, as shown  by a specific objection he  made minutes\n\nbefore to another  VE's opinion in the same case.   A copy of\n\nthe DOT was apparently available in the hearing room, for the\n\ntranscript shows that the  VE  directly consulted the  DOT at\n\nan earlier point in  his testimony.  Nevertheless, claimant's\n\nattorney did not  request specific DOT code numbers, nor seek\n\n                             -9-\n\nany  other  information that  might  shed light  on  the VE's\n\nsources.   The first  allusion to this  allegedly striking VE\n\nerror  appears  in  a  one-sentence  paragraph  inserted into\n\nclaimant's motion for reconsideration of the district court's\n\ndecision.  \n\n          \"We have long recognized that social security cases\n\nare not strictly  adversarial.\"   Evangelista v.

Here, however,  we\n   \n\nsee  no  good excuse  for the  failure  to raise  this matter\n\nsooner, and  claimant offers  none.  In  these circumstances,\n\nthere  is no unfairness  in applying the  \"ordinary rule that\n\nappellate courts will not  consider issues not raised below.\"\n\nGonzalez-Ayala v.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are thoroughly detailed in the decisions below.  Briefly, claimant alleges a disability due to injuries she sustained on February 28, 1988, when she jumped from a second story window to escape a fire.  She suffered significant fractures to both feet and a fractured vertebrae.  After a month in the hospital and physical therapy on an outpatient basis, she returned to her work at a shoe company in September, 1988.  Adjustments were made in her work duties to accommodate her new mobility limitations, and she remained at her job until the plant closed in December, 1988.  For a period thereafter she accepted unemployment benefits.  In April, 1989 she underwent a subtalor fusion of the left foot.  At the time the treating orthopedist noted that as a result of her fractures her feet were significantly deformed, with residual arthritis.  In July, 1990, a similar subtalor fusion was performed on her right foot.  It is not disputed that claimant relies on a cane, walks with difficulty, and apparently suffers permanent limitations on her ambulatory abilities.  She also suffers from hypertension and obesity, and complains of chronic lower back pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were two hearings before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) on claimant's application for disability benefits.  Claimant was represented by the same counsel at both hearings.  A decision denying benefits after the first hearing was vacated by the Appeals Council, and the matter remanded to the ALJ for the taking of additional evidence relating to claimant's post- operative condition.  The second hearing also resulted in a decision to deny benefits, and the Appeals Council denied review.  On cross-motions by the parties, the district court affirmed the Secretary's decision in a lengthy memorandum opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ's second decision found claimant not disabled at step five of the familiar sequential analytic process, in that claimant had a residual functional capacity to perform a limited range of unskilled sedentary jobs which exist in significant numbers in the national economy.  20 C.F.R. Secs. 404.1520(f), 404.1561, 404.1566.  Claimant renews in this court several of the multiple assignments of error she urged below, and attempts to add a new one for the first time on appeal.  First claimant argues, as below, that the ALJ failed to develop an adequate record relating to her residual functional capacity, because he violated an \"explicit order from the Appeals Council to have the examining physician [Dr. Shea] complete a specific form ... \" According to claimant, Dr. Shea should have filled out the very same preprinted form that was used by claimant's treating doctor, Dr. Wachs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant's reading of the Appeals Council's order is questionable,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but we need not tarry over this detail because the record developed below is clearly adequate.  The ALJ had before him a thorough residual functional assessment from Dr. Wachs, who was associated with claimant's treating orthopedist.  In addition, there was a full consultative examination by Dr. Shea, who was also familiar with the claimant, having evaluated her in connection with previous applications.  Dr. Shea's report contains detailed assessments of appellant's range of motion, reflexes, flexion, walking, sitting, and standing abilities.  Both doctors reported substantial limitations on claimant's functional abilities, reducing the range of work which she might perform to less than the full range of sedentary jobs available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the two doctors' reports are in different formats, but we fail to see any prejudice in this asymmetry.  Each report formed the basis of a separate hypothetical question propounded to the vocational expert (VE).  The VE identified approximately 67,500 jobs in the national economy which claimant might perform despite the functional limitations reported by Dr. Wachs, and 135,000 jobs despite the limitations observed by Dr. Shea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Even the lower of these two estimates sufficed to satisfy the Secretary's burden of showing \"significant numbers\" of suitable jobs in the national economy.  20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1566;   see also Keating v. Secretary of HHS, 848 F.2d 271, 276 (1st Cir. 1988) (to show that work exists in significant numbers, the Secretary must show significant, not isolated, numbers of jobs which a claimant can perform).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the ALJ's conclusion finds substantial support in the treating doctor's, Dr. Wach's, assessment, claimant's fallback argument that the ALJ substituted his own opinion for that of Dr. Shea is irrelevant, and in any event, rests on a strained reading of the record.  It is clear that claimant suffered no prejudice from the format of Dr. Shea's report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, claimant argues that the ALJ did not properly evaluate her subjective complaints of pain.  On our own review, we agree with the district court that the ALJ gave full and careful consideration to claimant's pain complaints in conformity with the regulations and case law.   See Avery v. Secretary of HHS, 797 F.2d 19, 21 (1st Cir. 1986).  The record does not support the contention that the ALJ gave undue weight to claimant's use of non-prescription pain medications.  We defer to the ALJ's assessment of claimant's credibility, especially as it was supported by specific findings.  See Frustaglia v. Secretary of HHS, 829 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, claimant argues, for the first time on appeal, that there was insufficient evidence because the VE \"mischaracterized,\" as exertionally sedentary, the various jobs he identified as available to a person with claimant's characteristics.  The VE testified that \"some\" jobs in the following categories would be suitable:  machine operation jobs, such as grinding, buffing and polishing;  manual assembler;  inspector;  and cashier/ticket seller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her appellate brief, claimant assigns code numbers to these job titles based on information in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (revised 4th ed.  1991) (DOT).  All of the code numbers which claimant assigns correspond to jobs which the DOT classifies as requiring a greater than \"sedentary\" exertional capacity, and in one instance, a greater skill level than claimant possesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VE, however, did not assign DOT code numbers in his testimony, only general job titles.  While the code numbers affixed by claimant refer to similar job titles, there are numerous DOT listings with superficially similar titles, or work descriptions, some of which are classified as sedentary and unskilled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Claimant's point thus cannot be readily verified by simply comparing some DOT listings with the VE's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other circumstances, the uncertainty generated by claimant's observations might cause concern.  While not the only reliable source of job information, the Secretary takes administrative notice of the accuracy of the DOT's generalized job descriptions.  See 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1566(d), Subpart P, app. 2, Sec. 200.00(b).  The Secretary bears the burden of proving the existence of jobs in the economy that the claimant can perform.   See Goodermote v. Secretary of HHS, 690 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1982).  A clear dichotomy between the DOT and the VE's testimony on this point may call into question the sufficiency of the Secretary's evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have vacated the Secretary's decisions where the VE's testimony is contradicted in its entirety by the DOT and the only reasonable explanation seems to be that the VE made a mistake.   See, e.g., Young v. Secretary of HHS, 957 F.2d 386, 392 (7th Cir. 1992) (VE's testimony as to characteristics of claimant's former jobs inconsistent with DOT description);   Ellison v. Sullivan, 921 F.2d 816, 821-22 (8th Cir. 1990) (claimant limited to sedentary work, all jobs listed by VE rated as light to heavy);   Tom v. Heckler, 779 F.2d 1250, 1255- 56, 1257 n.12 (7th Cir. 1985) (claimant limited to sedentary work;  all jobs listed by VE rated as light);   Mimms v. Heckler, 750 F.2d 180, 186 (2d Cir. 1984) (same).  In at least one of the cases, Tom, the court treated an irreconcilable conflict as the equivalent of plain error, remanding despite the failure of the claimant to object below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, not only is the alleged DOT contradiction uncertain, but the circumstances surrounding claimant's failure to object at the hearing suggest that this uncertainty is better explained by hindsight interpretation than by actual error.  Claimant was represented at the hearing by an experienced attorney, who evinced no surprise or confusion at the VE's testimony.  On the contrary, he complimented the VE on the thoroughness of his presentation.  The attorney was keenly aware that a discrepancy between the VE's articulation and the DOT might be used to claimant's advantage, as shown by a specific objection he made minutes before to another VE's opinion in the same case.  A copy of the DOT was apparently available in the hearing room, for the transcript shows that the VE directly consulted the DOT at an earlier point in his testimony.  Nevertheless, claimant's attorney did not request specific DOT code numbers, nor seek any other information that might shed light on the VE's sources.  The first allusion to this allegedly striking VE error appears in a one-sentence paragraph inserted into claimant's motion for reconsideration of the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have long recognized that social security cases are not strictly adversarial.\"   Evangelista v. Secretary of HHS, 826 F.2d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 1987).  Here, however, we see no good excuse for the failure to raise this matter sooner, and claimant offers none.  In these circumstances, there is no unfairness in applying the \"ordinary rule that appellate courts will not consider issues not raised below.\"   Gonzalez-Ayala v. Secretary of HHS, 807 F.2d 255, 256 (1st Cir. 1986) (citations omitted);   see also Torres v. Secretary of HHS, 870 F.2d 742 (1st Cir. 1989) (claimant's argument that ALJ's hypothetical omitted a crucial fact will not be entertained for first time on appeal where issues were simple, it was not likely that VE failed to consider the omitted fact, and claimant could have posed his own hypothetical);   cf.  Evangelista, 826 F.2d at 142- 43 (where claimant was able to fairly present his case and the ALJ's decision was based on substantial evidence, appeals court will not remand for presentation by claimant of arguably \"new and material evidence\" in absence of \"good cause\" adequate to excuse the failure to offer the evidence sooner).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Appeals Council instructed the ALJ to obtain, with the cooperation of claimant's attorney, medical evidence relating to claimant's post-operative condition,</p>\n        <p>[F]rom the claimant's treating sources ... a medical assessment of the claimant's ability to perform work-related activities (20 CFR 404.1513 and 416.913).  Further the [ALJ] will obtain an orthopedic consultative examination with a medical assessment in order to resolve the [severity of claimant's limitations].</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The numbers in the text are the adjusted totals computed by the ALJ.  The ALJ adjusted the VE's raw figures downward using percentage decreases which the VE had said would account for claimant's various limitations.  Our own reading of the transcript suggests that the ALJ's adjusted figure may be lower than the VE intended, as we glimpse the possibility of a double deduction, but since any mistake is in claimant's favor, we need not explore the matter further</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> While claimant urges that the meaning of \"significant numbers\" varies with the facts of each case, she points to nothing that might diminish the significance of the very high numbers in her case.  Her claim that her disability prevents her from driving is somewhat contradicted by her own testimony, and her alternate contention that there is little public transportation is irrelevant.   See Lopez-Diaz v. Secretary of HEW, 585 F.2d 1137, 1140-42 (1st Cir. 1978).  We also do not consider claimant's contentions relating to the \"significance\" of the smaller numbers given by the VE in response to hypotheticals which were based on the claimant's subjective complaints, because the VE found those complaints not credible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The code numbers and corresponding titles assigned by claimant are:  sanding machine buffer, D.O.T. 662.685-022;  polisher, D.O.T. 705.684-058;  polisher and buffer II, D.O.T. 705.684-062;  grinder, D.O.T. 555.685-026;  grinder II, D.O.T. 603.664-010;  assembler, small products, D.O.T. 706-684-022;  production assembler, D.O.T. 706-687-010;  inspector of plastics and composites, D.O.T. 806.261-046;  ticket seller, D.O.T. 211.467-030;  cashier II, D.O.T. 211.462-010;  cashier I, D.O.T. 211.362.010</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> For example, the DOT classifies the following jobs as exertionally sedentary, and requiring no more than 0-3 months of vocational preparation:  check cashier, D.O.T. 211.462-026;  cashier, tube room, 211.482.010;  pricer, message and delivery service, 214.467-014;  tax clerk, 219.487-010;  scheduler, 238.367-034;  heel sorter, 788.584-010.  Moreover, the Secretary's Medical-Vocational Guidelines, which takes administrative notice of the numbers of jobs generally available in the economy, reports the existence of a significant range of sedentary work available to a person of claimant's age (36) and skills (unskilled).  20 C.F.R., Subpart P, app. 2, Table No. 1, Rule 201.24.  The ALJ properly used the guidelines only as a \"frame of reference\" here because the claimant cannot perform a full range of sedentary activity.  20 C.F.R., Subpart P, app. 2, Sec. 200.00(d);  20 C.F.R.

Secretary of HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494588\"><a href=\"/opinion/494588/19-socsecrepser-60-unemplinsrep-cch-17576-joseph-t-frustaglia-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, claimant argues, for the first time on appeal, that there was insufficient evidence because the VE \"mischaracterized,\" as exertionally sedentary, the various jobs he identified as available to a person with claimant's characteristics.  The VE testified that \"some\" jobs in the following categories would be suitable:  machine operation jobs, such as grinding, buffing and polishing;  manual assembler;  inspector;  and cashier/ticket seller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her appellate brief, claimant assigns code numbers to these job titles based on information in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (revised 4th ed.  1991) (DOT).  All of the code numbers which claimant assigns correspond to jobs which the DOT classifies as requiring a greater than \"sedentary\" exertional capacity, and in one instance, a greater skill level than claimant possesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VE, however, did not assign DOT code numbers in his testimony, only general job titles.  While the code numbers affixed by claimant refer to similar job titles, there are numerous DOT listings with superficially similar titles, or work descriptions, some of which are classified as sedentary and unskilled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Claimant's point thus cannot be readily verified by simply comparing some DOT listings with the VE's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other circumstances, the uncertainty generated by claimant's observations might cause concern.  While not the only reliable source of job information, the Secretary takes administrative notice of the accuracy of the DOT's generalized job descriptions.  See 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1566(d), Subpart P, app. 2, Sec. 200.00(b).  The Secretary bears the burden of proving the existence of jobs in the economy that the claimant can perform.   See Goodermote v. Secretary of HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409370\"><a href=\"/opinion/409370/william-edward-goodermote-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 1982).  A clear dichotomy between the DOT and the VE's testimony on this point may call into question the sufficiency of the Secretary's evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have vacated the Secretary's decisions where the VE's testimony is contradicted in its entirety by the DOT and the only reasonable explanation seems to be that the VE made a mistake.   See, e.g., Young v. Secretary of HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578270\"><a href=\"/opinion/578270/john-s-young-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 392 (7th Cir. 1992) (VE's testimony as to characteristics of claimant's former jobs inconsistent with DOT description);   Ellison v.

In at least one of the cases, Tom, the court treated an irreconcilable conflict as the equivalent of plain error, remanding despite the failure of the claimant to object below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, not only is the alleged DOT contradiction uncertain, but the circumstances surrounding claimant's failure to object at the hearing suggest that this uncertainty is better explained by hindsight interpretation than by actual error.  Claimant was represented at the hearing by an experienced attorney, who evinced no surprise or confusion at the VE's testimony.  On the contrary, he complimented the VE on the thoroughness of his presentation.  The attorney was keenly aware that a discrepancy between the VE's articulation and the DOT might be used to claimant's advantage, as shown by a specific objection he made minutes before to another VE's opinion in the same case.  A copy of the DOT was apparently available in the hearing room, for the transcript shows that the VE directly consulted the DOT at an earlier point in his testimony.  Nevertheless, claimant's attorney did not request specific DOT code numbers, nor seek any other information that might shed light on the VE's sources.  The first allusion to this allegedly striking VE error appears in a one-sentence paragraph inserted into claimant's motion for reconsideration of the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have long recognized that social security cases are not strictly adversarial.\"   Evangelista v.

The ALJ adjusted the VE's raw figures downward using percentage decreases which the VE had said would account for claimant's various limitations.
