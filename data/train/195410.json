James  W.  Whitman,  a Rhode  Island\n                     \n\nprisoner, filed a pro se complaint seeking declaratory relief\n                        \n\nand  damages pursuant to 42  U.S.C.   1983.   Whitman claimed\n\nthat from 1979 to 1988 prison officials had repeatedly denied\n\nhim the opportunity to donate  blood in exchange for sentence\n\nreduction under a  state statute  then in effect.   See  R.I.\n                                                       \n\nGen.  Laws    42-56-25 (repealed  June 1988).    The district\n\ncourt,    endorsing    a   magistrate-judge's    report   and\n\nrecommendation, dismissed the complaint for failure  to state\n\na  claim  because, at  its  core,  the complaint  essentially\n\nsought sentence reduction to  which money damages were merely\n\nsubordinate, and,  as such, presented only unexhausted habeas\n\nclaims.  With the modification discussed below, we affirm for\n\nsubstantially the reasons stated in the magistrate's June 15,\n\n1993  report  and  recommendation,  to  which  we  add  these\n\ncomments.\n\n          To begin,  Whitman's complaint for  relief does not\n\nexplicitly request  a reduction of sentence;  rather, he asks\n\nto be  granted an \"accreditation,\" i.e.,  a recognition, that\n                                       \n\nbut  for defendant's  conduct, he  would otherwise  have been\n\nentitled  to 320  days of  good-time.   In addition,  Whitman\n\nseeks $150  per day for each  day he would have  had deducted\n\nfrom  his sentence  had defendant  not deprived  him \"of  the\n\nopportunity to  donate blood  in exchange for  a commensurate\n\nsentence reduction.\"\n\n                             -2-\n\n          Although  Whitman does not go so far as to say that\n\nhe  wants neither  sentence reduction  nor early  release, he\n\ninsists  that the  relief  sought is  solely  to redress  his\n\ndeprivation of  the due process rights recognized  in Raso v.\n                                                          \n\nMoran,  551  F.  Supp.  294  (D.R.I.  1982),1  and  that  the\n     \n\ndistrict court mistakenly construed his complaint as a habeas\n\ncorpus action solely  because Whitman had phrased part of the\n\nrelief sought as sentence related.  Whitman contends that the\n                                 \n\ndesignated  320-day good-time loss  was simply to demonstrate\n\nfor purposes of  calculating damages how  much time he  could\n\nhave  earned if  he had  not been  denied the  opportunity to\n\ndonate blood.\n\n          To  the extent  that Whitman  seeks to  shorten the\n\nduration  of his  confinement, the  district court  correctly\n\nfound  that such relief is cognizable  only in federal habeas\n\ncorpus, with  its  concomitant requirement  of exhaustion  of\n\n                    \n\n1.    Raso  decided  that the  statute  created  two separate\n          \nconstitutionally protected liberty interests.  The first, and\nthe one  about which Whitman complains, is that \"inmates have\na  legitimate  expectation  that   they  will  be  given  the\nopportunity to donate blood up to four times a year in return\nfor a  ten-day sentence reduction absent disqualification for\nhealth reasons.\"   Id. at 299.  The second,  triggered once a\n                      \nblood  donation is made, entitles an inmate to a reduction in\nsentence.  Id.   Raso also decided that the  statute required\n                     \nprison officials to establish and administer a blood donation\nprogram in  which all  qualified  inmates could  participate.\nId. at 298.   To protect an inmate from  wrongful deprivation\n   \nof the opportunity  to give blood, Raso  concluded that there\n                                       \nmust  be  notice   and  a  statement   of  reasons  for   any\ndisqualification as well as procedures by which inmates could\nchallenge  the  accuracy  of  that  determination  and submit\nwritten evidence of their health status.  Id. at 301.\n                                            \n\n                             -3-\n\nstate remedies, 28 U.S.C.    2254(b).  Preiser  v. Rodriguez,\n                                                            \n\n411 U.S.  475,  500 (1973).    Whitman, however,  also  seeks\n\ndeclaratory relief and an award  of monetary damages to which\n\nexhaustion would not  apply.  Id.  at 494; see also  Wolff v.\n                                                          \n\nMcDonnell,  418  U.S. 539,  555  (1974).   Nonetheless,  even\n         \n\nthough  Whitman's  complaint  does   not  seek  release  from\n\ncustody,  the  adjudication of  his    1983  claims,  at this\n\njuncture, would invariably require a federal court to address\n\nthe question  of  the constitutionality  of state  procedures\n\nutilized  to  determine  eligibility  for  the  blood   donor\n\nprogram.   The \"core\"  of Whitman's complaint  is the alleged\n\ndenial  of  the  constitutionally  protected  opportunity  to\n\nreduce  his sentence  by donating blood.   Raso,  in deciding\n                                               \n\nwhat process was  due before that opportunity  could be taken\n\naway, observed  that such a denial  was substantially similar\n\nto the  restoration of good-time credits  considered in Wolff\n                                                             \n\nv.

Raso viewed the\n                                                  \n\nstatutory right to participate in the  blood donor program as\n\none  that  \"directly  affects  the duration  of  an  inmate's\n\nsentence  and possibly  affects  the actual  duration of  his\n\nconfinement.\"  Id.  To that extent, it was proper to construe\n                  \n\nthe complaint as a habeas petition and to require exhaustion.\n\nPreiser, 411 U.S. at 500;  see Young v.

See Bressman v.

While  we note that Granberry v. Greer, 481 U.S. 129, 135\n                                          \n&amp;   n.7   (1987),  would   not   require   exhaustion  of   a\nnonmeritorious  habeas petition, Whitman's  petition raises a\ncolorable federal claim.\n\n                             -5-\n\nrather than stayed indefinitely), cert.  granted, 62 U.S.L.W.\n                                                \n\n3470  (1994).    Thus,  the district  court  should  consider\n\nstaying Whitman's    1983 action  until the state  courts are\n\ngiven   the   opportunity    to   resolve   allegations    of\n\nconstitutional  error  involving  the  administration  of the\n\ninmate early release blood donor program under R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n  42-56-25.\n\n          The district court judgment is  affirmed insofar as\n                                                  \n\nit directs  exhaustion of state remedies  relating to alleged\n\nviolations  of any  liberty interests  inherent in  R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws    42-56-25;  the judgment  is  reversed insofar  as  it\n                                             \n\ndismisses  the    1983 action.   The  action is  remanded for\n                                                         \n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Unless the\n\ndistrict court  determines that the    1983 claims  are time-\n\nbarred, or that a dismissal without prejudice is  adequate to\n\npreserve them,  further district  court proceedings on  the  \n\n1983  claims should  be  stayed pending  exhaustion of  state\n\nremedies.3\n\n          Affirmed in  part; reversed  in part; remanded  for\n                                                             \n\nfurther proceedings.\n                   \n\n                    \n\n3.  Alternatively,  the  district   court  may  consider  the\npropriety of a conditional stay.  See, e.g., Dewyer v. Davis,\n                                                            \n842 F.

Whitman, a Rhode Island prisoner, filed a pro se complaint seeking declaratory relief and damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.  Whitman claimed that from 1979 to 1988 prison officials had repeatedly denied him the opportunity to donate blood in exchange for sentence reduction under a state statute then in effect.  See R.I. Gen. Laws Sec. 42-56-25 (repealed June 1988).  The district court, endorsing a magistrate-judge's report and recommendation, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim because, at its core, the complaint essentially sought sentence reduction to which money damages were merely subordinate, and, as such, presented only unexhausted habeas claims.  With the modification discussed below, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated in the magistrate's June 15, 1993 report and recommendation, to which we add these comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, Whitman's complaint for relief does not explicitly request a reduction of sentence;  rather, he asks to be granted an \"accreditation,\" i.e., a recognition, that but for defendant's conduct, he would otherwise have been entitled to 320 days of good-time.  In addition, Whitman seeks $150 per day for each day he would have had deducted from his sentence had defendant not deprived him \"of the opportunity to donate blood in exchange for a commensurate sentence reduction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Whitman does not go so far as to say that he wants neither sentence reduction nor early release, he insists that the relief sought is solely to redress his deprivation of the due process rights recognized in  Raso v. Moran, 551 F. Supp. 294 (D.R.I. 1982),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that the district court mistakenly construed his complaint as a habeas corpus action solely because Whitman had phrased part of the relief sought as sentence related.  Whitman contends that the designated 320-day good-time loss was simply to demonstrate for purposes of calculating damages how much time he could have earned if he had not been denied the opportunity to donate blood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Whitman seeks to shorten the duration of his confinement, the district court correctly found that such relief is cognizable only in federal habeas corpus, with its concomitant requirement of exhaustion of state remedies, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254(b).   Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973).  Whitman, however, also seeks declaratory relief and an award of monetary damages to which exhaustion would not apply.   Id. at 494;   see also Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555 (1974).  Nonetheless, even though Whitman's complaint does not seek release from custody, the adjudication of his Sec. 1983 claims, at this juncture, would invariably require a federal court to address the question of the constitutionality of state procedures utilized to determine eligibility for the blood donor program.  The \"core\" of Whitman's complaint is the alleged denial of the constitutionally protected opportunity to reduce his sentence by donating blood.  Raso, in deciding what process was due before that opportunity could be taken away, observed that such a denial was substantially similar to the restoration of good- time credits considered in Wolff v. McDonnell, and found foreclosed under  Preiser.  Wolff, 418 U.S. at 554, 561;   Raso, 551 F. Supp. at 300.  Raso viewed the statutory right to participate in the blood donor program as one that \"directly affects the duration of an inmate's sentence and possibly affects the actual duration of his confinement.\"  Id. To that extent, it was proper to construe the complaint as a habeas petition and to require exhaustion.   Preiser, 411 U.S. at 500;   see Young v. Kenny, 907 F.2d 874, 876 (9th Cir. 1989) (\"habeas must be the exclusive federal remedy not just when a state prisoner requests the invalidation or reduction of his sentence, but whenever the requested relief requires as its predicate a determination that a sentence being served is invalid or unconstitutionally long\") (collecting cases), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1127;   Offet v. Solem, 823 F.2d 1256, 1257 (8th Cir. 1987) (Sec. 1983 complaint for declaratory relief and damages indirectly attacks the length of confinement and directly implicates the policies of federal-state comity requiring exhaustion).  Whitman's request to amend would not yield a different result.   See Bressman v. Farrier, 900 F.2d 1305, 1307 (8th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1127.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, where, as here, the complaint could be read as invoking both a civil rights and habeas remedy,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the district court should stay rather than dismiss the suit.

Thus, the district court should consider staying Whitman's Sec. 1983 action until the state courts are given the opportunity to resolve allegations of constitutional error involving the administration of the inmate early release blood donor program under R.I.

Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge ]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James J. Whitman on brief pro se.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Michael B. Grant, Senior Legal Counsel, Rhode Island Department of Corrections, on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Torruella, Selya and Cyr, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Per Curiam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James W. Whitman, a Rhode Island prisoner, filed a pro se complaint seeking declaratory relief and damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.  Whitman claimed that from 1979 to 1988 prison officials had repeatedly denied him the opportunity to donate blood in exchange for sentence reduction under a state statute then in effect.  See R.I. Gen. Laws Sec. 42-56-25 (repealed June 1988).  The district court, endorsing a magistrate-judge's report and recommendation, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim because, at its core, the complaint essentially sought sentence reduction to which money damages were merely subordinate, and, as such, presented only unexhausted habeas claims.  With the modification discussed below, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated in the magistrate's June 15, 1993 report and recommendation, to which we add these comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, Whitman's complaint for relief does not explicitly request a reduction of sentence;  rather, he asks to be granted an \"accreditation,\" i.e., a recognition, that but for defendant's conduct, he would otherwise have been entitled to 320 days of good-time.  In addition, Whitman seeks $150 per day for each day he would have had deducted from his sentence had defendant not deprived him \"of the opportunity to donate blood in exchange for a commensurate sentence reduction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Whitman does not go so far as to say that he wants neither sentence reduction nor early release, he insists that the relief sought is solely to redress his deprivation of the due process rights recognized in  Raso v. Moran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2365771\"><a href=\"/opinion/2365771/raso-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span> </a></span>(D.R.I. 1982),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that the district court mistakenly construed his complaint as a habeas corpus action solely because Whitman had phrased part of the relief sought as sentence related.  Whitman contends that the designated 320-day good-time loss was simply to demonstrate for purposes of calculating damages how much time he could have earned if he had not been denied the opportunity to donate blood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Whitman seeks to shorten the duration of his confinement, the district court correctly found that such relief is cognizable only in federal habeas corpus, with its concomitant requirement of exhaustion of state remedies, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254(b).   Preiser v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108772\"><a href=\"/opinion/108772/preiser-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 500 (1973).  Whitman, however, also seeks declaratory relief and an award of monetary damages to which exhaustion would not apply.   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108772\"><a href=\"/opinion/108772/preiser-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 494; </a></span>  see also Wolff v. McDonnell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span>, 555 (1974).  Nonetheless, even though Whitman's complaint does not seek release from custody, the adjudication of his Sec. 1983 claims, at this juncture, would invariably require a federal court to address the question of the constitutionality of state procedures utilized to determine eligibility for the blood donor program.  The \"core\" of Whitman's complaint is the alleged denial of the constitutionally protected opportunity to reduce his sentence by donating blood.  Raso, in deciding what process was due before that opportunity could be taken away, observed that such a denial was substantially similar to the restoration of good- time credits considered in Wolff v. McDonnell, and found foreclosed under  Preiser.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wolff,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 561;   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2365771\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Raso,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/2365771/raso-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Raso viewed the statutory right to participate in the blood donor program as one that \"directly affects the duration of an inmate's sentence and possibly affects the actual duration of his confinement.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2365771\"><a href=\"/opinion/2365771/raso-v-moran/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> To that </a></span>extent, it was proper to construe the complaint as a habeas petition and to require exhaustion.   <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108772\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Preiser,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/108772/preiser-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>;   see Young v.

Whitman's request to amend would not yield a different result.   See Bressman v.
