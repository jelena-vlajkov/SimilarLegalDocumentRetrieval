Christopher Turner,  a Massachusetts\r                                 \r\n\nprisoner, appeals pro se the dismissal of his complaint under\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   1983.  We affirm.\r\n\n     Turner's complaint  was  filed  on  February  28,  1994.\r\n\nNamed as defendants were (1) two Assistant District Attorneys\r\n\nwho had  prosecuted charges  against Turner stemming  from an\r\n\narrest in June  1990 while  Turner was on  parole, (2)  three\r\n\nMassachusetts parole officers who later  brought him in on  a\r\n\nparole violation  warrant related to that arrest, and (3) the\r\n\nChairperson of  the Massachusetts Parole Board.   The charges\r\n\nunderlying the June 1990 arrest were dismissed with prejudice\r\n\non  September  19, 1990.    The  essence of  the  complaint's\r\n\nallegations is  that use of those  dismissed charges resulted\r\n\nin Turner's parole revocation and deprived him of due process\r\n\nof law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\n\n     The  district court  found  that the  lawsuit was  filed\r\n\nbeyond the statute of limitations  and was time-barred.   The\r\n\napplicable statute of limitations  for   1983 actions arising\r\n\nin Massachusetts requires that  such claims be brought within\r\n\nthree years.    Street v.  Vose, 936  F.2d 38,  39 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1991); Mass. Gen. L. ch. 260,    2A.  Turner does not dispute\r\n\nthat three years is the correct limitations period.   Rather,\r\n\nTurner  argues  that,  for  various  reasons, the  applicable\r\n\nperiod in which to sue should be suspended.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     First,  Turner  claims that  his  status  as a  prisoner\r\n\nprevented a  timely filing  of his complaint.   However,  the\r\n\nMassachusetts tolling  statute, Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 260,    7,\r\n\ndeleted imprisonment as  a tolling condition  in 1987.1   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat  40-41 &amp; n.4.   In addition, assuming  that Turner's claim\r\n\naccrued  between June  14,  1990, when  he was  arrested, and\r\n\nSeptember 19, 1990, when those charges were dismissed, Turner\r\n\nhas not been continuously  incarcerated since then.  Turner's\r\n\nfilings  indicate  that after  the  charges  were dropped  in\r\n\nSeptember 1990, he was  released on parole in  December 1990,\r\n\nand remained on supervised release until September 1991, when\r\n\nhis parole was revoked.\r\n\n     Second,  Turner  contends that  he  was  unaware of  the\r\n\npertinent   limitations  period  because   of  the  allegedly\r\n\ninadequate law library and  legal assistance available at the\r\n\nDisciplinary  Department Unit at  M.C.I. Cedar  Junction, the\r\n\nrestricted  unit where he  was confined  for over  two years.\r\n\nTurner appears  to claim that such  conditions of confinement\r\n\nwere a legal disability sufficient to toll the running of the\r\n\nthree year  limitations period.  While  equitable tolling has\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  To the  extent that Turner contends  that the limitations\r\nperiod should  be tolled  under Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  260,    7\r\nbecause of mental incompetence, that claim was not before the\r\ndistrict  court and no basis for such  a claim appears in the\r\nrecord.  In the  same vein, Turner's reliance on  Wheatley v.\r                                                                      \r\nAT  &amp;  T Co.,  418  Mass. 394,  636  N.E. 2d  265  (1994), is\r                        \r\nmisplaced.    Wheatley  held  that  an  equivocal  employment\r                                  \r\ntermination notice did not trigger the running of the statute\r\nof limitations. \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nbeen  applied in   1983  cases, see, e.g.,  Lown v. Brimeyer,\r                                                                        \r\n\n956 F.2d  780, 782 (8th Cir.),  cert. denied, 113  S. Ct. 176\r                                                        \r\n\n(1992); Smith v. Chicago Heights, 951 F.2d 834, 839 (7th Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1992), the application of the doctrine is inappropriate here.\r\n\nTurner states  that after his  return to prison  he consulted\r\n\nwith  two attorneys, and, moreover, does  not allege that his\r\n\naccess  to the prison law library was denied or restricted at\r\n\nanytime or that it  did not contain the basic tools for legal\r\n\nresearch.  See Wilson v. Geisen, 956 F.2d  738, 742 (7th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1992).   In  short, Turner  failed to  show that  despite his\r\n\ndiligence, he could not obtain the information needed to file\r\n\nhis  complaint on time.  See Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n920  F.2d 446, 451-52 (7th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n1261 (1991).\r\n\n     Since Turner's claims--based on events  that occurred in\r\n\n1990--accrued more than  three years prior  to the filing  of\r\n\nthis complaint in February 1994, they were properly dismissed\r\n\nby the district court as time-barred.\r\n\n     Accordingly,  the judgment  of  the  district  court  is\r\n\naffirmed.   The defendants'  motion to dismiss  the appeal as\r                    \r\n\nuntimely is denied as moot.\r                              \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
