Claimant Pedro Rivera  Ojeda filed an\n                    \n\napplication for  Social Security disability benefits  on June\n\n20,  1990, alleging a back condition, severe back pain, and a\n\nnervous condition.   After a  hearing, the ALJ  conceded that\n\nclaimant had  a severe  back  impairment that  precluded  his\n\nreturn to  his former job as  a janitor required  to do heavy\n\nwork.   The  ALJ  found,  however,  that  despite  claimant's\n\nexertional   impairments   claimant  retained   the  residual\n\nfunctional capacity to perform light  work.  The ALJ  further\n\nfound  that claimant's  non-exertional impairments  (his pain\n\nand mental  condition)  did not  significantly  restrict  his\n\ncapacity  to perform the  full range of  jobs requiring light\n\nwork.   Accordingly, the ALJ  found claimant not  disabled at\n\nstep 4  of the  sequential  evaluation process,  20 C.F.R.   \n\n404.1520(e),  on  the  ground  that  claimant's  impairments,\n\nalthough they  precluded performing  his former  janitor job,\n\ndid  not preclude his return to his  former type of work as a\n                                                \n\njanitor.    This  type  of  work,  the ALJ  ruled,  generally\n\nrequires no more than light work.\n\n     After  the Appeals Council denied claimant's request for\n\nreview of  the  ALJ's  decision,  claimant  appealed  to  the\n\ndistrict court, which affirmed.  Claimant appeals, contending\n\nthat  the  Secretary's  determination  is  not  supported  by\n\nsubstantial evidence.  We affirm.\n\n     The  objective  medical  evidence concerning  claimant's\n\nphysical condition can be summarized as follows.  Dr. Ruiz, a\n\ngeneral practitioner, examined  claimant on January  5, 1990,\n\nand diagnosed cervical and dorso-lumbar spondlyoarthritis and\n\nmuscle  spasm and left carpal tunnel syndrome.  Dr. Vargas, a\n\nphysiatrist, treated claimant between February and April 1990\n\nand reported moderate to severe muscle spasm, but good muscle\n\ntone  and no atrophy, and  left carpal tunnel  syndrome.  Dr.\n\nGonzalez Cotto, a neurologist,  examined claimant on July 23,\n\n1990, and diagnosed chronic discogenic disease.\n\n     The record contains substantial  evidence to support the\n\nALJ's  functional conclusion  that  claimant,  despite  these\n\nimpairments, retains the exertional capacity to perform light\n\nwork.   Dr. Sanchez, a non-examining  physician, reviewed the\n\nmedical  evidence  in  the  record and  prepared  a  residual\n\nfunctional  capacity  assessment form  on  February 5,  1991,\n\naccompanied  by brief  medical findings.   On  the form,  Dr.\n\nSanchez checked  boxes indicating  that claimant can  lift or\n\ncarry 20  pounds, 10 pounds  frequently, can stand,  walk, or\n\nsit six hours, and can climb, balance, stoop,  kneel, crouch,\n\nand  crawl  occasionally.   Dr.  Sanchez  further found  that\n\nclaimant could not perform  repetitive movements in his upper\n\nextremities,  and  was  limited  in his  capacity  for  gross\n\nmanipulation by the hands.\n\n     Another non-examining physician, Dr.  Marxuach, reviewed\n\nthe medical  evidence in the  record and prepared  a residual\n\nfunctional  capacity  assessment  form  on August  13,  1990,\n\naccompanied by  brief medical  findings.  Dr.  Marxuach, like\n\nDr. Sanchez, checked boxes  indicating that claimant can lift\n\nor carry 20 pounds, 10 pounds frequently, can stand, walk, or\n\n                             -3-\n\nsit six hours, and can climb,  balance, stoop, kneel, crouch,\n\nand  crawl  occasionally.    Dr. Marxuach  noted  no  further\n\nlimitations.\n\n     The   governing  regulations   state  that   light  work\n\n\"involves  lifting  no more  than 20  pounds  at a  time with\n\nfrequent lifting  or carrying of  objects weighing  up to  10\n\npounds [and] requires  a good deal  of walking or  standing.\"\n\n20  C.F.R.   404.1567(b).   These regulations  do not require\n\nthat  a person be able to perform repetitive movements of the\n\nupper extremities or gross  manipulation of the hands,  or be\n\nable  to climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl more\n\nthan  occasionally, in  order to  be able  to perform  a full\n\nrange  of jobs requiring light work.  Thus, both Dr. Sanchez'\n\nand Dr.  Marxuach's findings support the  ALJ's determination\n\nthat claimant can perform light work.\n\n     We have held that the amount of weight that can properly\n\nbe given  the  conclusions of  non-testifying,  non-examining\n\nphysicians \"will vary with the circumstances.\"  Berrios Lopez\n                                                             \n\nv.  Secretary of Health and Human Services, 951 F.2d 427, 431\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and\n                                                             \n\nHuman Services, 647  F.2d 218, 223 (1st  Cir. 1981)); Gordils\n                                                             \n\nv.

In  some cases,  written  reports\n\nsubmitted by non-testifying, non-examining  physicians cannot\n\nalone   constitute  substantial   evidence,  see   Browne  v.\n                                                         \n\n                             -4-\n\nRichardson, 468 F.2d  1003 (1972),  although this  is not  an\n          \n\nabsolute  rule.   Berrios  Lopez,  supra,  951  F.2d at  431;\n                                        \n\nGordils,  supra, 921 F.2d at  328.  This  issue has generally\n               \n\narisen in cases where such reports were the primary  evidence\n\nof a claimant's residual  functional capacity, since \"the ALJ\n\nis  not qualified  to assess  claimant's residual  functional\n\ncapacity  based on the bare  medical record.\"  Berrios Lopez,\n                                                            \n\nsupra, 951 F.2d at 430.\n     \n\n     In  this   case,  however,  these   residual  functional\n\ncapacity assessments by non-examining physicians are not  the\n\nonly evidence expressed in functional terms that supports the\n\nSecretary's conclusion  that claimant retains the capacity to\n\nperform light work.  Dr. Vargas cleared claimant to return to\n\nwork  on  April  5,  1990, which  suggests  that  Dr.  Vargas\n\nbelieved  that claimant  could  return to  his heavy  janitor\n\nposition.   At the  hearing, furthermore,  claimant testified\n\nthat a doctor  had recommended that he  walk at least a  half\n\nmile, and that  \"the doctors  have told me  that the  maximum\n\nthat I'd [sic] might be able to try to lift  would be fifteen\n\nto twenty pounds.\"  This testimony relates a partial residual\n\nfunctional capacity assessment  made by examining physicians.\n\nSince light work,  again, \"involves lifting  no more than  20\n\npounds  at a  time,\" 20  C.F.R.    404.1567(b), this  partial\n\nresidual functional capacity assessment bolsters the findings\n\nof the  non-examining physicians  that  claimant can  perform\n\n                             -5-\n\nlight  work.  Based on this  evidence we find that the record\n\ndoes  contain substantial functional  evidence to support the\n\nSecretary's conclusion to that effect.\n\n     A  finding  that  a  claimant can  perform  light  work,\n\nhowever,  does  not  necessarily  mean that  a  claimant  can\n\nperform  any particular type of  work -- such  as the janitor\n            \n\nwork  in this case -- that requires an exertional capacity to\n\ndo no  more than light work.  Janitor work in general may, or\n\nmay  not, require other  specific capabilities  that claimant\n\nmay, or may not, possess.  Claimant argues that the ALJ, as a\n\nlayman, was not qualified  to reach the vocational conclusion\n\nthat   janitor  work   in  general   does  not   require  any\n\ncapabilities that claimant's impairments  deny him.  To reach\n\nthat  vocational conclusion, claimant  insists, the testimony\n\nof  a  vocational  expert,  at  step  5  of   the  sequential\n\nevaluation  process,  20  C.F.R.     404.1520(f),   would  be\n\nnecessary.  \n\n     We need not  resolve this question.  Even  if we were to\n\nfind that the record  lacked substantial vocational  evidence\n\nfor  the conclusion at step 4 that claimant could perform his\n\nformer type of work  as a janitor, we would  still affirm the\n\nSecretary  at step  5, without  need for  the testimony  of a\n\nvocational   expert,   by  applying   the  Medical-Vocational\n\nGuidelines,  20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart  P, Appendix 2 (\"the\n\ngrid\").\n\n                             -6-\n\n     The grid  is based  on a claimant's  exertional capacity\n\nand  can  only  be  applied  where claimant's  non-exertional\n\nlimitations do not significantly impair claimant's ability to\n\nperform at a given exertional level.  Sherwin v. Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHealth and Human  Services, 685  F.2d 1, 3  (1st Cir.  1982),\n                          \n\ncert.  denied, 461  U.S.  958 (1983).    We find  substantial\n             \n\nevidence in  the record  to support the  Secretary's findings\n\nthat claimant's non-exertional impairments -- back pain and a\n\nmental condition  -- do not significantly  impair his ability\n\nto perform a full range of light work.\n\n     In  addressing claimant's  complaints of back  pain, the\n\nALJ  expressly followed  the  analysis required  by Avery  v.\n                                                         \n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, 797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir.\n                                      \n\n1986), for  evaluating subjective complaints of  pain.  Based\n\non   the   medical  evidence   already  mentioned,   the  ALJ\n\npermissibly  found  that claimant  did  not  suffer from  any\n\nobjective medical condition that would ordinarily be expected\n\nto  cause disabling  pain.   As  we  have noted,  Dr.  Vargas\n\ncleared claimant to return  to work in April  1990.  The  ALJ\n\nalso  stated that his doubts about the severity of claimant's\n\npain were \"further corroborated  by the claimant's appearance\n\nand  demeanor at  the  hearing.    The  claimant  was  in  no\n\nsignificant physical  or emotional distress, and  he was able\n\nto move about freely.  He provided information accurately and\n\nrelated  adequately.\"    The  ALJ  concluded  that  \"claimant\n\n                             -7-\n\npossibly  has  mild occasional  discomfort associated  to his\n\ncondition,  but he does not  have disabling .  . . distress.\"\n\nThe record contains ample evidence to support this finding.\n\n     As  for claimant's  mental condition, progress  notes of\n\nhis treatment by the Mental  Health Program of the Department\n\nof Health stated that he had a somatoform disorder.  Although\n\nhe  complained  of  uneasiness  and an  inability  to  sleep,\n\nclaimant was nevertheless found to  be oriented in the  three\n\nspheres,   cooperative,   coherent,   and    relevant,   with\n\nappropriate  affect.    Claimant  was  also  reported  to  be\n\n\"feeling   better   with   medication.\"      A  non-examining\n\npsychologist reviewed the record and,  in an October 9, 1990,\n\nreport,  found  that  claimant was  suffering  from  anxiety-\n\nrelated  disorders with  no severe  impairment and  with only\n\nslight functional limitations.  In view of this  evidence, we\n\ncannot find  a lack  of substantial  evidence to support  the\n\nSecretary's finding that claimant's mental condition did  not\n\nsignificantly affect his ability to perform the full range of\n\njobs that require light work.\n\n     Given   the   amply-supported  findings   that  claimant\n\npossessed the  exertional capacity to perform  light work and\n\nthat his pain and his mental condition did not  significantly\n\naffect his  ability to do  so, Rule  202.16 of  the grid  can\n\nproperly  be  applied in  this case.    That Rule  dictates a\n\nfinding of \"not disabled.\"\n\n                             -8-\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  \n                                                   \n\n                             -9-\n",

After a hearing, the ALJ conceded that claimant had a severe back impairment that precluded his return to his former job as a janitor required to do heavy work.  The ALJ found, however, that despite claimant's exertional impairments claimant retained the residual functional capacity to perform light work.  The ALJ further found that claimant's non-exertional impairments (his pain and mental condition) did not significantly restrict his capacity to perform the full range of jobs requiring light work.  Accordingly, the ALJ found claimant not disabled at step 4 of the sequential evaluation process, 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1520(e), on the ground that claimant's impairments, although they precluded performing his former janitor job, did not preclude his return to his former type of work as a janitor.

Dr. Vargas, a physiatrist, treated claimant between February and April 1990 and reported moderate to severe muscle spasm, but good muscle tone and no atrophy, and left carpal tunnel syndrome.

Dr. Sanchez, a non-examining physician, reviewed the medical evidence in the record and prepared a residual functional capacity assessment form on February 5, 1991, accompanied by brief medical findings.  On the form, Dr. Sanchez checked boxes indicating that claimant can lift or carry 20 pounds, 10 pounds frequently, can stand, walk, or sit six hours, and can climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl occasionally.  Dr. Sanchez further found that claimant could not perform repetitive movements in his upper extremities, and was limited in his capacity for gross manipulation by the hands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another non-examining physician, Dr. Marxuach, reviewed the medical evidence in the record and prepared a residual functional capacity assessment form on August 13, 1990, accompanied by brief medical findings.  Dr. Marxuach, like Dr. Sanchez, checked boxes indicating that claimant can lift or carry 20 pounds, 10 pounds frequently, can stand, walk, or sit six hours, and can climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl occasionally.

These regulations do not require that a person be able to perform repetitive movements of the upper extremities or gross manipulation of the hands, or be able to climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl more than occasionally, in order to be able to perform a full range of jobs requiring light work.

This issue has generally arisen in cases where such reports were the primary evidence of a claimant's residual functional capacity, since \"the ALJ is not qualified to assess claimant's residual functional capacity based on the bare medical record.\"   Berrios Lopez, supra, 951 F.2d at 430.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, these residual functional capacity assessments by non-examining physicians are not the only evidence expressed in functional terms that supports the Secretary's conclusion that claimant retains the capacity to perform light work.  Dr. Vargas cleared claimant to return to work on April 5, 1990, which suggests that Dr. Vargas believed that claimant could return to his heavy janitor position.  At the hearing, furthermore, claimant testified that a doctor had recommended that he walk at least a half mile, and that \"the doctors have told me that the maximum that I'd [sic] might be able to try to lift would be fifteen to twenty pounds.\"  This testimony relates a partial residual functional capacity assessment made by examining physicians.  Since light work, again, \"involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time,\" 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1567(b), this partial residual functional capacity assessment bolsters the findings of the non-examining physicians that claimant can perform light work.  Based on this evidence we find that the record does contain substantial functional evidence to support the Secretary's conclusion to that effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A finding that a claimant can perform light work, however, does not necessarily mean that a claimant can perform any particular type of work-such as the janitor work in this case-that requires an exertional capacity to do no more than light work.  Janitor work in general may, or may not, require other specific capabilities that claimant may, or may not, possess.  Claimant argues that the ALJ, as a layman, was not qualified to reach the vocational conclusion that janitor work in general does not require any capabilities that claimant's impairments deny him.  To reach that vocational conclusion, claimant insists, the testimony of a vocational expert, at step 5 of the sequential evaluation process, 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1520(f), would be necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve this question.  Even if we were to find that the record lacked substantial vocational evidence for the conclusion at step 4 that claimant could perform his former type of work as a janitor, we would still affirm the Secretary at step 5, without need for the testimony of a vocational expert, by applying the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R.

Sherwin v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 685 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 958 (1983).

Secretary of Health and Human Services, 797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1986), for evaluating subjective complaints of pain.  Based on the medical evidence already mentioned, the ALJ permissibly found that claimant did not suffer from any objective medical condition that would ordinarily be expected to cause disabling pain.  As we have noted, Dr. Vargas cleared claimant to return to work in April 1990.  The ALJ also stated that his doubts about the severity of claimant's pain were \"further corroborated by the claimant's appearance and demeanor at the hearing.  The claimant was in no significant physical or emotional distress, and he was able to move about freely.  He provided information accurately and related adequately.\"  The ALJ concluded that \"claimant possibly has mild occasional discomfort associated to his condition, but he does not have disabling ... distress.\"  The record contains ample evidence to support this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for claimant's mental condition, progress notes of his treatment by the Mental Health Program of the Department of Health stated that he had a somatoform disorder.  Although he complained of uneasiness and an inability to sleep, claimant was nevertheless found to be oriented in the three spheres, cooperative, coherent, and relevant, with appropriate affect.  Claimant was also reported to be \"feeling better with medication.\"  A non-examining psychologist reviewed the record and, in an October 9, 1990, report, found that claimant was suffering from anxiety-related disorders with no severe impairment and with only slight functional limitations.  In view of this evidence, we cannot find a lack of substantial evidence to support the Secretary's finding that claimant's mental condition did not significantly affect his ability to perform the full range of jobs that require light work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the amply-supported findings that claimant possessed the exertional capacity to perform light work and that his pain and his mental condition did not significantly affect his ability to do so, Rule 202.16 of the grid can properly be applied in this case.

After a hearing, the ALJ conceded that claimant had a severe back impairment that precluded his return to his former job as a janitor required to do heavy work.  The ALJ found, however, that despite claimant's exertional impairments claimant retained the residual functional capacity to perform light work.  The ALJ further found that claimant's non-exertional impairments (his pain and mental condition) did not significantly restrict his capacity to perform the full range of jobs requiring light work.  Accordingly, the ALJ found claimant not disabled at step 4 of the sequential evaluation process, 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1520(e), on the ground that claimant's impairments, although they precluded performing his former janitor job, did not preclude his return to his former type of work as a janitor.  This type of work, the ALJ ruled, generally requires no more than light work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Appeals Council denied claimant's request for review of the ALJ's decision, claimant appealed to the district court, which affirmed.  Claimant appeals, contending that the Secretary's determination is not supported by substantial evidence.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The objective medical evidence concerning claimant's physical condition can be summarized as follows.  Dr. Ruiz, a general practitioner, examined claimant on January 5, 1990, and diagnosed cervical and dorso-lumbar spondlyoarthritis and muscle spasm and left carpal tunnel syndrome.  Dr. Vargas, a physiatrist, treated claimant between February and April 1990 and reported moderate to severe muscle spasm, but good muscle tone and no atrophy, and left carpal tunnel syndrome.  Dr. Gonzalez Cotto, a neurologist, examined claimant on July 23, 1990, and diagnosed chronic discogenic disease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains substantial evidence to support the ALJ's functional conclusion that claimant, despite these impairments, retains the exertional capacity to perform light work.  Dr. Sanchez, a non-examining physician, reviewed the medical evidence in the record and prepared a residual functional capacity assessment form on February 5, 1991, accompanied by brief medical findings.  On the form, Dr. Sanchez checked boxes indicating that claimant can lift or carry 20 pounds, 10 pounds frequently, can stand, walk, or sit six hours, and can climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl occasionally.  Dr. Sanchez further found that claimant could not perform repetitive movements in his upper extremities, and was limited in his capacity for gross manipulation by the hands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another non-examining physician, Dr. Marxuach, reviewed the medical evidence in the record and prepared a residual functional capacity assessment form on August 13, 1990, accompanied by brief medical findings.  Dr. Marxuach, like Dr. Sanchez, checked boxes indicating that claimant can lift or carry 20 pounds, 10 pounds frequently, can stand, walk, or sit six hours, and can climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl occasionally.  Dr. Marxuach noted no further limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The governing regulations state that light work \"involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds [and] requires a good deal of walking or standing.\"  20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1567(b).  These regulations do not require that a person be able to perform repetitive movements of the upper extremities or gross manipulation of the hands, or be able to climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl more than occasionally, in order to be able to perform a full range of jobs requiring light work.  Thus, both Dr. Sanchez' and Dr. Marxuach's findings support the ALJ's determination that claimant can perform light work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that the amount of weight that can properly be given the conclusions of non-testifying, non-examining physicians \"will vary with the circumstances.\"   Berrios Lopez v.
