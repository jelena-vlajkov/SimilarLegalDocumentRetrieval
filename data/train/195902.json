During the pendency of the direct appeal of\r                           \n\nhis conviction  and sentence  for conspiracy, bank  fraud and\n\nmoney laundering, Ambrose  Devaney filed pro se  a motion for\r                                                           \n\ndiscovery and  a motion  to  compel service  in the  district\n\ncourt.   Although  \"[a]s  a general  rule  with only  limited\n\nexceptions, entry of a notice of appeal divests  the district\n\ncourt of  jurisdiction to  adjudicate any matters  related to\n\nthe  appeal,\" United States v. Distasio, 820 F.2d 20, 23 (1st\r                                                   \n\nCir.  1987) (citing  cases), the  district court  denied both\n\nmotions.    In these  circumstances, and  because we  find no\n\nsubstantial  question  presented by  the  pro  se appeal,  we\r                                                             \n\nconsider the appeal and dismiss it on its merits.

We find no abuse of discretion in\n\nthe district court's  denial of  Devaney's discovery  motion.\n\nSee  Buckley, 847  F.2d  at 1003  (post  judgment motion  for\r                        \n\ndiscovery within discretion of district court).\r\r\n\n     Nor  do we  find  any error  in  the court's  denial  of\n\nDevaney's motion to compel  the government to serve him  as a\n\npro se  litigant.  Since  Devaney was represented  by counsel\r                  \n\nbefore the  district court, his motion to  compel service was\n\nan implicit request to  proceed via \"hybrid\"  representation.\n\nMcKaskle  v.
