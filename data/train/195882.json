A male,\n\nacting alone, presented a teller with a handwritten robbery note.\n\nAccording  to a bank audit, the teller gave the robber $1,185.10.\n\nThe robber  fled from the  bank on foot.   The bank's  video sur-\n\nveillance  system recorded the robbery and it was also  witnessed\n\nby others in the bank.\n\n          On  May 23,  1993,  the defendant  was indicted  on one\n\ncount of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C.A.   2113(a) by a Grand Jury\n\nsitting in  Boston,  Massachusetts.   On  January 28,  1994,  the\n\ndefendant was convicted by a jury in United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts.  On April  20, 1994, the trial\n\njudge sentenced the defendant  to prison for 210 months  with two\r\r\n\nyears  supervised release  and  a special  assessment of  $50.00.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                II\r                                          II\n\n                   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\r                             SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n          The court's standard of appellate review for challenges\n\nbased on the sufficiency of the evidence is settled.  \"[O]ur task\n\nis to review  the record  to determine whether  the evidence  and\n\nreasonable  inferences therefrom,  taken as  a whole  and in  the\n\nlight most  favorable to the prosecution, would  allow a rational\n\njury to determine  beyond a reasonable doubt  that the defendants\n\nwere guilty as charged.\"   United States v.

See 18 U.S.C.A.   2113(a) (\"whoever, by\r                                       \n\nforce and  violence, or by  intimidation, takes,  or attempts  to\n\ntake, from the person or presence of another any property\").  The\n\ndefendant complains  that the circumstantial evidence placing him\n\nat the scene of  the crime, namely the forensic  evidence related\n\nto  his fingerprints and handwriting,  is \"too weak  to support a\n\nreasonable  inference of  guilt.\"1   The  defendant argues  that,\n\nunder a  line of  \"fingerprints only\"  cases, identity  cannot be\n\nestablished solely by forensic evidence found on a movable object\n\nat  the   crime  scene   absent  sufficient  evidence   that  the\n\nfingerprints were placed on the object at the time of the crime.\n\n          We  have  not  yet addressed  the  \"fingerprints  only\"\n\nissue.   The defendant is correct that other circuits have, under\n\nvarious circumstances, struck  down convictions  based solely  on\n\n                    \r                              \n\n1   For purposes of  this appeal, the  defendant does not dispute\nthat he wrote the demand note used in the bank robbery.\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nfingerprints obtained from  movable items.

An FBI\n\nforensic  document examiner  with twenty-seven  years' experience\n\ntestified that, based on  a comparison of the handwriting  on the\n\ndemand  note and a written exemplar provided by the defendant, he\n\nwas reasonably  certain that  the same individual  wrote on  both\n\nsheets of paper.\n\n          The incriminating nature of the demand note and related\n\ntestimony by two  FBI experts is obvious.   However, we need  not\n\ndetermine whether evidence related to this \"movable\" object alone\n\nis sufficient to  identify the defendant  as the government  also\n\nadduced other  evidence.   Isabel  Araujo,  the bank  teller  who\n\nreceived the demand note and handed over the cash, testified that\n\nthe robber was  a black  male dressed in  a multi-colored  black,\n\nwhite and red  jacket with  a baseball hat.   She  \"guesstimated\"\n\nthat  he was  approximately six  feet tall,  explaining that  she\n\ndetermined the  measurement by comparison to her  father whom she\n\nknew to be  approximately that  height.  Araujo  did concede,  on\n\nboth direct and cross-examination, that immediately following the\n\nrobbery  she had reported to police officials that the robber was\n\nsomewhat  shorter (between 5'7\"  and 5'9\").   She  also testified\n\nthat she did not remember if the robber had facial hair.2\n                    \r                              \n\n2   A prosecution witness,  State Police Sergeant  Michael Tobin,\ntestified  on cross-examination  that  Araujo told  him that  the\nrobber was clean-shaven.\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          The government also  introduced a videotape,  retrieved\n\nfrom the bank's security cameras,  which depicted the interior of\n\nthe bank during  the robbery  and showed Araujo  and the  robber.\n\nThe   defense  introduced   a  still   photograph  electronically\n\nreproduced from the videotape, again depicting the  robber at the\n\nscene of the crime.3\n\n          The  defendant was  present  in  the  courtroom  during\n\ntrial.  The jury  had the opportunity to compare  the testimonial\n\nand   photo-graphic    evidence   of   the    robber's   physical\n\ncharacteristics with the outward appearance of the defendant.  As\n\npart of the deliberative process, the jury was entitled to assess\n\nwitness credibility  and to weigh  the evidence  adduced by  both\n\nsides.4\n\n          Based on our review  of the entire record in  the light\n\nmost favorable  to the prosecution, we conclude that the evidence\n\nintroduced at trial would allow a rational jury to find, beyond a\n\nreasonable  doubt,  that the  defendant  was  the  robber and  to\n\nconvict the defendant for bank robbery.\n\n                               III\r                                         III\n\n              REFUSAL TO DEPART UNDER THE GUIDELINES\r                        REFUSAL TO DEPART UNDER THE GUIDELINES\n\n                    \r                              \n\n3  We have reviewed  both the videotape and the  still photograph\nand acknowledge that neither  presents a particularly sharp image\nof the robber.\n\n4  At  trial, the  defendant introduced evidence  to support  his\ncontention  that  he differed  in  physical  appearance from  the\nrobber in terms of height and facial hair.\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          The  defendant next  requests a de  novo review  of his\r                                                            \n\nsentence  on  the grounds  that  the  district court  erroneously\n\nconcluded it  lacked the authority  to depart downward  under the\n\nguidelines.5   The government responds that  the district court's\n\nrefusal to  depart was discretionary and  unreviewable on appeal.\n\nWe agree.\n\n          By statute, a defendant may appeal  a sentence based on\n\nan  incorrect  application  of  the sentencing  guidelines.    18\n\nU.S.C.A.   3742(a)(2)  (West Supp. 1994).

Wade, appeals his conviction and sentence for bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2113(a).  He asserts that the evidence introduced at trial was not sufficient to support a conviction under the statute.  He further asserts that the district court's refusal to depart downward was based on an erroneous belief that the court lacked the authority under the guidelines to do so.  We affirm the conviction.  We lack jurisdiction to review the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 11, 1992, the Boston Five Cent Savings Bank, 569 Washington Street, Boston, Massachusetts, was robbed shortly after 9:00 a.m.  The bank was federally insured.  A male, acting alone, presented a teller with a handwritten robbery note.  According to a bank audit, the teller gave the robber $1,185.10.  The robber fled from the bank on foot.  The bank's video surveillance system recorded the robbery and it was also witnessed by others in the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 1993, the defendant was indicted on one count of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2113(a) by a Grand Jury sitting in Boston, Massachusetts.  On January 28, 1994, the defendant was convicted by a jury in United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  On April 20, 1994, the trial judge sentenced the defendant to prison for 210 months with two years supervised release and a special assessment of $50.00.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's standard of appellate review for challenges based on the sufficiency of the evidence is settled.  \"[O]ur task is to review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty as charged.\"  United States v. DeMasi, No. 92-2062, slip op. at 16 (1st Cir.  Oct. 26, 1994) (quoting United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1550 (1994), modified on other grounds sub nom., United States v. Piper, No. 94-1197 slip op.  (1st Cir.  Sept. 8, 1994)).  We credit both direct and circumstantial evidence but do not weigh the relative weight of the evidence or make credibility determinations.  United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 589-90 (1st Cir. 1994);  Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d at 1031;  United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).  Rather, \"the jury is at liberty to select freely among a variety of reasonable alternative constructions of the evidence.\"  Loder, 23 F.3d at 590 (citing United States v. Smith, 680 F.2d 255, 259 (1st Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1110 (1983)).  As a result, we affirm convictions so long as the jury verdict finds support in a \"plausible rendition of the record,\" United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1005 (1993)), even if a verdict \"other than one of guilt could reasonably have been reached.\"  DeMasi, slip op. at 16;  see United States v. Vavlitis, 9 F.3d 206, 212 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"government need not disprove every reasonable hypothesis of innocence\" where record supports verdict beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain a conviction for bank robbery, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the defendant as the robber.  See 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2113(a) (\"whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another any property\").  The defendant complains that the circumstantial evidence placing him at the scene of the crime, namely the forensic evidence related to his fingerprints and handwriting, is \"too weak to support a reasonable inference of guilt.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The defendant argues that, under a line of \"fingerprints only\" cases, identity cannot be established solely by forensic evidence found on a movable object at the crime scene absent sufficient evidence that the fingerprints were placed on the object at the time of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have not yet addressed the \"fingerprints only\" issue.  The defendant is correct that other circuits have, under various circumstances, struck down convictions based solely on fingerprints obtained from movable items.  See, e.g., Mikes v. Borg, 947 F.2d 353, 356-57, 360-61 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 3055 (1992);  United States v. Corso, 439 F.2d 956, 957 (4th Cir. 1971);  United States v. Collon, 426 F.2d 939, 942 (6th Cir. 1970).  Conversly, convictions are upheld on appeal where the trial record includes incriminating evidence beyond that found on the movable object.  See, e.g., United States v. Luna, 21 F.3d. 874, 883-84 (9th Cir. 1994) (bank robbery conviction not based only on fingerprints where bank teller testified that robber, like defendant, had tattoo on neck);  McMillan v. G omez, 19 F.3d 465, 469 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 170 (1994) (conviction not based only on fingerprints where evidence indicated that defendant's fingerprints \"could have only been put on [movable object] at a time very close to the murder\");  United States v. Field, 875 F.2d 130, 136-37 (7th Cir. 1989) (conviction not based only on fingerprints where there was \"plenty of evidence from which the jury could infer\" that defendant placed fingerprints on money orders during unlawful alteration).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the record to determine if the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to convict the defendant under the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced the handwritten demand note used in the robbery with the following appearing on it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Good morning I will be empting [sic] your drawer this morning no die no tricks [sic] I have a bomb and gun that will self destruct immediately so dont [sic] do anything stupid thank you!!!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An FBI fingerprint specialist with nearly thirty years' experience testified that, based on a comparison of the defendant's fingerprints and those present on the demand note, he was certain the defendant had handled the demand note.  An FBI forensic document examiner with twenty-seven years' experience testified that, based on a comparison of the handwriting on the demand note and a written exemplar provided by the defendant, he was reasonably certain that the same individual wrote on both sheets of paper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incriminating nature of the demand note and related testimony by two FBI experts is obvious.  However, we need not determine whether evidence related to this \"movable\" object alone is sufficient to identify the defendant as the government also adduced other evidence.  Isabel Araujo, the bank teller who received the demand note and handed over the cash, testified that the robber was a black male dressed in a multi-colored black, white and red jacket with a baseball hat.  She \"guesstimated\" that he was approximately six feet tall, explaining that she determined the measurement by comparison to her father whom she knew to be approximately that height.  Araujo did concede, on both direct and cross-examination, that immediately following the robbery she had reported to police officials that the robber was somewhat shorter (between 5'7\" and 5'9\").  She also testified that she did not remember if the robber had facial hair.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also introduced a videotape, retrieved from the bank's security cameras, which depicted the interior of the bank during the robbery and showed Araujo and the robber.  The defense introduced a still photograph electronically reproduced from the videotape, again depicting the robber at the scene of the crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant was present in the courtroom during trial.  The jury had the opportunity to compare the testimonial and photo-graphic evidence of the robber's physical characteristics with the outward appearance of the defendant.  As part of the deliberative process, the jury was entitled to assess witness credibility and to weigh the evidence adduced by both sides.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our review of the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the evidence introduced at trial would allow a rational jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was the robber and to convict the defendant for bank robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>REFUSAL TO DEPART UNDER THE GUIDELINES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant next requests a de novo review of his sentence on the grounds that the district court erroneously concluded it lacked the authority to depart downward under the guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The government responds that the district court's refusal to depart was discretionary and unreviewable on appeal.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By statute, a defendant may appeal a sentence based on an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.  18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 3742(a)(2) (West Supp. 1994).  Refusal by the trial judge to depart is not considered an \"incorrect application\" of the guidelines.  United States v. Tucker, 892 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1989).  \"It is by now axiomatic that a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on a sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range.\"  United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994), petition for cert. filed, (Oct. 25, 1994) (quoting United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1290 (1st Cir. 1992);  United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct 224 (1992);  United States v. Hilton, 946 F.2d 955, 957 (1st Cir. 1991);  United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1991)).  There is an exception to this general rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>[A]ppellate jurisdiction may attach if it appears that the failure to depart stemmed from the sentencing court's mistaken impression that it lacked the legal authority to deviate from the guideline range or, relatedly, from the court's misapprehension of the rules governing departures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (quoting United States v.

However, there can be little doubt that the court made a fact-based, discretionary decision not to depart.  The government, apparently concerned that the trial judge's initial remarks could be characterized as ambiguous on appeal, elicited a clarification:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>AUSA: Just for clarity of the record, is the Court's finding that it does not find the facts in the Presentence Report sufficiently unusual to support a departure?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>COURT: In other words, on the basis of the fact [sic] that have been brought to my attention, I do not feel that they warrant a departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Final Judgment confirms the discretionary nature of the trial judge's refusal to depart downward.  The \"Statement of Reasons\" section includes the following text:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>The sentence is within the guideline range ... and the sentence is imposed for the following reasons(s):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>THE COURT DOES NOT FIND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FACTS AS SET FORTH IN THE PRESENTENCE REPORT AND DEFENDANT'S SENTENCING SUBMISSIONS WARRANT DEPARTURE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, cognizant of its legal authority to depart, examined the facts of the defendant's case and made a discretionary decision not to depart based on those facts.

He asserts that the evidence introduced at trial was not sufficient to support a conviction under the statute.

A male, acting alone, presented a teller with a handwritten robbery note.  According to a bank audit, the teller gave the robber $1,185.10.  The robber fled from the bank on foot.  The bank's video surveillance system recorded the robbery and it was also witnessed by others in the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 1993, the defendant was indicted on one count of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2113(a) by a Grand Jury sitting in Boston, Massachusetts.  On January 28, 1994, the defendant was convicted by a jury in United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  On April 20, 1994, the trial judge sentenced the defendant to prison for 210 months with two years supervised release and a special assessment of $50.00.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's standard of appellate review for challenges based on the sufficiency of the evidence is settled.  \"[O]ur task is to review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty as charged.\"  United States v.

See 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2113(a) (\"whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another any property\").  The defendant complains that the circumstantial evidence placing him at the scene of the crime, namely the forensic evidence related to his fingerprints and handwriting, is \"too weak to support a reasonable inference of guilt.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The defendant argues that, under a line of \"fingerprints only\" cases, identity cannot be established solely by forensic evidence found on a movable object at the crime scene absent sufficient evidence that the fingerprints were placed on the object at the time of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have not yet addressed the \"fingerprints only\" issue.  The defendant is correct that other circuits have, under various circumstances, struck down convictions based solely on fingerprints obtained from movable items.  See, e.g., Mikes v. Borg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570447\"><a href=\"/opinion/570447/melvin-mikes-v-robert-g-borg-warden-attorney-general-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span>, 356-57, 360-61 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Conversly, convictions are upheld on appeal where the trial record includes incriminating evidence beyond that found on the movable object.  See, e.g., United States v.

An FBI forensic document examiner with twenty-seven years' experience testified that, based on a comparison of the handwriting on the demand note and a written exemplar provided by the defendant, he was reasonably certain that the same individual wrote on both sheets of paper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incriminating nature of the demand note and related testimony by two FBI experts is obvious.  However, we need not determine whether evidence related to this \"movable\" object alone is sufficient to identify the defendant as the government also adduced other evidence.  Isabel Araujo, the bank teller who received the demand note and handed over the cash, testified that the robber was a black male dressed in a multi-colored black, white and red jacket with a baseball hat.  She \"guesstimated\" that he was approximately six feet tall, explaining that she determined the measurement by comparison to her father whom she knew to be approximately that height.  Araujo did concede, on both direct and cross-examination, that immediately following the robbery she had reported to police officials that the robber was somewhat shorter (between 5'7\" and 5'9\").  She also testified that she did not remember if the robber had facial hair.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also introduced a videotape, retrieved from the bank's security cameras, which depicted the interior of the bank during the robbery and showed Araujo and the robber.  The defense introduced a still photograph electronically reproduced from the videotape, again depicting the robber at the scene of the crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant was present in the courtroom during trial.  The jury had the opportunity to compare the testimonial and photo-graphic evidence of the robber's physical characteristics with the outward appearance of the defendant.  As part of the deliberative process, the jury was entitled to assess witness credibility and to weigh the evidence adduced by both sides.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our review of the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the evidence introduced at trial would allow a rational jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was the robber and to convict the defendant for bank robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>REFUSAL TO DEPART UNDER THE GUIDELINES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant next requests a de novo review of his sentence on the grounds that the district court erroneously concluded it lacked the authority to depart downward under the guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The government responds that the district court's refusal to depart was discretionary and unreviewable on appeal.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By statute, a defendant may appeal a sentence based on an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.  18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 3742(a)(2) (West Supp. 1994).  Refusal by the trial judge to depart is not considered an \"incorrect application\" of the guidelines.  United States v.

However, there can be little doubt that the court made a fact-based, discretionary decision not to depart.
