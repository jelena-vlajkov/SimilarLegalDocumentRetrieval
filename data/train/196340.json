Stern, United States  Attorney, and  C. Jeffrey Kinder,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  In October 1993, defendant Bryon Miseph was\r                           \r\n\nsentenced to  a combined 100-month prison  term following his\r\n\nguilty  plea  to  cocaine  and  firearms  offenses.    Nearly\r\n\nfourteen  months later, he filed a motion under Fed. R. Crim.\r\n\nP.  41(e) for the return  of some eighteen  firearms that had\r\n\nbeen taken from his  residence following his arrest--claiming\r\n\nthat the  items  had  been unlawfully  seized  and  had  been\r\n\nunrelated  to  his  criminal  activity.    In  response,  the\r\n\ngovernment stated that, after  notice to all known interested\r\n\nparties  had been provided and  no claim had  been filed, the\r\n\nproperty had been administratively forfeited and subsequently\r\n\ndestroyed.    Evidence  attesting   to  the  declaration   of\r\n\nforfeiture and  the destruction  was provided.   The district\r\n\ncourt denied  the motion the following  day--finding that the\r\n\nproperty was no longer  in existence and that, in  any event,\r\n\nit  had been \"lawfully seized  and forfeited.\"  Defendant now\r\n\nappeals,  claiming  that  he  never received  notice  of  the\r\n\nforfeiture.   He notes in this regard that, pursuant to court\r\n\norder,  he  had been  confined  under \"house  arrest\"  in his\r\n\nparents' residence in East Falmouth, Massachusetts during the\r\n\nrelevant period.\r\n\n     The issue before  us is  a narrow one.   The  government\r\n\nacknowledges  that  a  district  court  has  jurisdiction  to\r\n\nentertain  collateral due  process attacks  on administrative\r\n\nforfeitures.  See,  e.g., United States  v. Giraldo, 45  F.3d\r                                                               \r\r\n\n509,  511 (1st Cir. 1995)  (per curiam) (listing  cases).  It\r\n\nalso  acknowledges that  the destruction  of the  property in\r\n\nquestion here did not  render such an action moot--suggesting\r\n\nthat the  motion could  have  been treated  as an  \"equitable\r\n\nclaim for damages,\" see, e.g., Rufu v. United States, 20 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n63, 65 (2d Cir.  1994); United States v. Martinson,  809 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n1364, 1366-69 (9th Cir. 1987), and noting that a civil action\r\n\nfor damages would in any event lie, see, e.g., Mora v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 955 F.2d 156,  160 (2d Cir. 1992); cf.  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Mosquera,  845  F.2d  1122,  1126 (1st  Cir.  1988)  (per\r                        \r\n\ncuriam).   The government  simply contends that,  as the Rule\r\n\n41(e) motion  was properly  denied, we should  affirm without\r\n\nprejudice  to   defendant  filing   a  separate   action  for\r\n\nappropriate relief.\r\n\n     We  agree.    Defendant   has  raised  his  due  process\r\n\nchallenge for the  first time only on  appeal.  As  such, the\r\n\ndistrict  court's ruling  obviously  cannot be  considered an\r\n\nabuse  of discretion  based upon  the record then  before the\r\n\ncourt.  To be  sure, it might have  been better practice  had\r\n\nthe  district  court  afforded defendant  an  opportunity  to\r\n\naddress  the  government's  opposition before  ruling.    Yet\r\n\ndefendant (who claims that he first learned of the forfeiture\r\n\nand  destruction  by  reading  such  opposition)  could  have\r\n\npresented his due process challenge to the lower court by way\r\n\nof  a timely motion for reconsideration, but failed to do so.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nUnder these circumstances, we  think it appropriate to affirm\r\n\nthe  district  court's  order,  albeit  without prejudice  to\r\n\ndefendant's  assertion  of  his   due  process  claim  in  an\r\n\nindependent action under 28 U.S.C.   1331.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  \r                          \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
