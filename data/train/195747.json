We\r                                          \r\n\nare  left to  decide important  issues that  require  a balancing\r\n\nbetween First Amendment rights and governmental interests.\r\n\n          Defendant-Appellant    Beacon     Hill    Architectural\r\n\nCommission (the  \"Commission\") enacted  a regulation, the  Street\r\n\nFurniture   Guideline,   which    effectively   bans    newspaper\r\n\ndistribution boxes from the public streets of the Historic Beacon\r\n\nHill  District in  Boston, Massachusetts  (the \"District\").   The\r\n\nvalidity of this  regulation was  challenged in a  suit filed  in\r\n\ndistrict  court by  Plaintiffs-Appellees,  a group  of  newspaper\r\n\npublishers (the \"Newspapers\").   The district court held that the\r\n\nCommission lacked the authority to adopt the  regulation and also\r\n\nthat it violated rights  guaranteed by the First Amendment.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGlobe Newspaper Co. v.  Beacon Hill Architectural Comm'n,  847 F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp. 178 (D. Mass. 1994).  \r\n\n          In the  ensuing appeal by the  Commission, we concluded\r\n\nthat  the  appropriate  course  of  action  was  to  certify  the\r\n\ndispositive issue of state  law to the Supreme Judicial  Court of\r\n\nMassachusetts (the \"SJC\") and so proceeded.  To the question\r\n\n          Did the Beacon Hill  Architectural Commission\r\n          have the authority  under 1955  Massachusetts\r\n          Act  Chapter 616  (as amended)  to adopt  the\r\n          \"Street Furniture Guideline\"?\r\n\nthe SJC answered in the affirmative.   See Globe Newspaper Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBeacon Hill Architectural Comm'n,  421 Mass. 570 (1996).   In its\r                                          \r\n\nresponse,  the  SJC held  that  the Commission  had  authority to\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nregulate   newsracks   and  other   \"street   furniture\"  through\r\n\nrulemaking  and to  completely ban  entire classes  of structures\r\n\nsuch as newsracks.  Id. at 590-91.  Specifically, it said:\r                                 \r\n\n          As    to    streets   and    sidewalks,   the\r\n          [C]ommission's  jurisdiction   is  concurrent\r\n          with    appropriate    municipal    agencies.\r\n          Regulation  of  the  sidewalks is  rationally\r\n          related  to   the  goal  of   preserving  the\r\n          Historic Beacon Hill District.   Section 4 of\r\n          the enabling [A]ct provides  the [C]ommission\r\n          with the authority to issue rules that govern\r\n          private   conduct   within   its   particular\r\n          geographic  area  of   responsibility.     We\r\n          conclude  that,   apart  from  constitutional\r\n          considerations,  outright   bans  on  certain\r\n          classes  of structures are merely a practical\r\n          consequence of the [C]ommission's  ability to\r\n          proscribe        inappropriate       exterior\r\n          architectural features within the [D]istrict.\r\n\nId.  We  thus focus  our attention on  the constitutional  issue,\r             \r\n\nwhich  requires  us to  determine  whether  the Street  Furniture\r\n\nGuideline violates  rights guaranteed  by the First  Amendment to\r\n\nthe Newspapers.   We  conclude that it  does not and  reverse the\r\n\ndecision of the district court.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          The Historic Beacon Hill District was created by an act\r\n\nof the Massachusetts General Court in 1955.   See 1955 Mass. Acts\r                                                           \r\n\nch. 616 (\"the Act\"), as amended by 1958 Mass. Acts ch. 314 &amp; 315,\r\n\n1963 Mass. Acts ch. 622, 1965 Mass.

The Act is intended to\r\n\n          promote  the educational,  cultural, economic\r\n          and general welfare of the public through the\r\n          preservation  of  the  historic  Beacon  Hill\r\n          district, and to maintain said district  as a\r\n          landmark in  the history of  architecture and\r\n          as a  tangible reminder  of old Boston  as it\r\n          existed    in   the   early   days   of   the\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          commonwealth.\r\n\n1955  Mass.

Indeed,  it was  listed in  the\r\n\nNational Register  of Historic  Places and designated  a National\r\n\nHistoric Landmark on October  15, 1966, pursuant to the  National\r\n\nHistoric Preservation Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C.A. 470 et seq.\r                                                                   \r\n\n          The Commission  was created to review  proposed changes\r\n\nto the \"exterior architectural feature[s]\" of \"structures\" within\r\n\nthe  District.

Anyone  wishing  to  construct,\r                   \r\n\nreconstruct  or   alter  an  exterior  architectural  feature  is\r\n\nrequired  to  apply  to  the  Commission  for  a  certificate  of\r\n\nappropriateness.

Agreed Statement of Facts at 4, p. 16.\r\n\n3     The  record  shows that  the  Newspapers'  publications are\r\navailable in stores and newsracks near the District as follows:\r\n\n                    HERALD   USA    GLOBE   WSJ    NYT    TAB\r\n\n   Stores within\r\n   one block of       4       2      10      2      4      0\r\n   the District\r\n   Newsracks                                  \r\n   within one         4       9       7      1      6      7\r\n   block of the\r\n   District\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ncomplain  of the  \"unsightliness,  congestion  and  inconvenience\r\n\nassociated with  the vending machines.\"   The Commission believed\r\n\nthat   the   newsracks   violated   the   guideline   prohibiting\r\n\nfree-standing  signs.   It took  no enforcement  action, however,\r\n\nbecause a  city-wide regulation of newsracks  was being discussed\r\n\nin the early 1980s. \r\n\n          In 1990, no regulation  having been adopted, the Beacon\r\n\nHill Civic Association petitioned  the Commission for a guideline\r\n\nto exclude newsracks from  the District.  After holding  a public\r\n\nmeeting  regarding  the  petition,4  the Commission  conducted  a\r\n\nsurvey  and completed,  in January,  1991, a  study entitled  the\r\n\n\"Publication Distribution Box Report (the \"Report\").  See Exhibit\r                                                                   \r\n\nH (in the record).   Soon thereafter, on  February 21, 1991,  the\r\n\nCommission  held  a  public  hearing5 on  the  proposal  to adopt\r\n\nguidelines for  newsracks and, ultimately, adopted  the following\r\n\nguideline:\r\n\n          Publication  distribution  boxes  (any  boxes\r\n          placed   on   the  sidewalks   to  distribute\r\n          publications,  whether  for  charge  or  not)\r\n          visible  from a  public way  are not  allowed\r\n          within the District. \r\n\nIn its  decision, the  Commission indicated that  the publication\r\n\ndistribution guideline  (\"PDG\") was consistent with its guideline\r\n\nbanning freestanding signs and the Commission's decisions denying\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   Although notice of this meeting was mailed to the Newspapers'\r\nmain  offices,  notice  was  not received  by  their  Circulation\r\nDepartments and,  of the  Newspapers, only  the TAB  appeared and\r\ncommented on the petition.\r\n\n5  Again, although notice was mailed, the Newspapers' Circulation\r\nDepartments did not receive the notice and, thus, did not attend.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nthe  installation   of  traffic  signal  control   boxes  on  the\r\n\nsidewalks,  and the  regulation of  the installation  of a  cable\r\n\ntelevision system in the District. \r\n\n          A few months  later, on April  1, 1991, the  Commission\r\n\nnotified the Newspapers of  the new guideline.  One  month later,\r\n\nit requested that the  Newspapers remove their newsracks by  June\r\n\n1,  1991.    Then,  after  the   Newspapers  requested  that  the\r\n\nCommission reconsider  its decision to adopt  its regulation, the\r\n\nCommission  heard testimony  from the  Newspapers in  July, 1991.\r\n\nAfter voting to deny reconsideration, the Commission extended the\r\n\nremoval  deadline until  October 1,  1991.   Within a  month, the\r\n\nNewspapers  brought suit  in  district court  seeking declaratory\r\n\nrelief,  damages, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief\r\n\nfrom  the regulation, on the grounds that it violated their First\r\n\nAmendment right to distribute newspapers in the District. \r\n\n          After  a bench  trial  on stipulated  facts, the  court\r\n\nruled from  the  bench that  the  regulation offended  the  First\r\n\nAmendment: \r\n\n          . .  . , \"instead of  being narrowly tailored\r\n          with  respect to  the limitation  on speech[,\r\n          the PDG] is  narrowly tailored to  focus only\r\n          on speech.  It  applies to no form  of visual\r\n          clutter other than public[ation] distribution\r\n          boxes. . . .\"  Significantly, the trial judge\r\n          was  \"troubled  whether  there  is  statutory\r\n          authority   for   the   particular  kind   of\r\n          legislative rule making\"  illustrated by  the\r\n          guideline.   He  did not  decide the  case on\r\n          state  law  grounds,  however,  because  \"the\r\n          questions     about     the     Architectural\r\n          Commission's authority are at least debatable\r\n          on the present record . . . and perhaps would\r\n          require some supplementation of the record in\r\n          order for the Court to resolve them. . . .\"\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nGlobe Newspaper, 40 F.3d at 20 (quoting bench trial transcript).\r                         \r\n\n          After the bench ruling but before judgment had entered,\r\n\nthe  Commission  adopted  a  new  guideline--the  present  Street\r\n\nFurniture  Guideline--that bans all  \"street furniture,\" not just\r\n\nnewsracks, from the District:\r\n\n          Street furniture, as defined below, shall not\r\n          be  permitted  in  the  Historic  Beacon Hill\r\n          District  with  the  exception   of  approved\r\n          store-front  merchandise   stands  and  those\r\n          structures  erected  or placed  by authorized\r\n          public  agencies  for  public  safety  and/or\r\n          public welfare purposes.  Street furniture is\r\n          defined as any structure erected or placed in\r\n          the public or private  ways on a temporary or\r\n          permanent basis.\r\n\n          Authorized   public   safety/public   welfare\r\n          street furniture includes, but is not limited\r\n          to, such structures as street lights, traffic\r\n          lights,  mail  boxes,  fire hydrants,  street\r\n          trees,  and  trash  receptacles.

This time, the district judge\r\n\nnot only  held that the new  guideline fared no better  under the\r\n\nFirst Amendment,  but also  that the Commission  lacked authority\r\n\nunder  Massachusetts law to adopt the new regulation.6  See Globe\r                                                                           \r\n\nNewspaper, 847 F.

We  know that\r\n\nfew  constitutional rights,  if  any, are  absolute, and  in most\r\n\nconstitutional litigation what courts are called upon to do is to\r\n\nbalance  competing fundamental  rights.

First,\r\n\nMinneapolis Star, one of  a line of cases establishing  rules for\r                          \r\n\nthe economic regulation  of the  press, did not  involve a  time,\r\n\nplace and manner  restriction.   The tax on  newsprint there  was\r\n\nheld unconstitutional,  because it applied only to  the press and\r\n\ndiscriminated in favor  of one class of  publishers over another;\r\n\ni.e., it  was not generally  applicable.   Minneapolis Star,  460\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.  at  581.   More  importantly, unlike  the  Street Furniture\r\n\nGuideline   which  adversely   affects   only   one   method   of\r\n\ndistribution,  the   regulation  there  rendered  all   forms  of\r\n\ncirculation  more  burdensome.   Second,  unlike  the  case of  a\r\n\ndiscriminatory  tax,  the  Commission  asserts,  and  the  Street\r\n\nFurniture Guideline  present regulation advances,  colorable non-\r\n\ncontent-discriminatory purposes:   aesthetics.   Last, we believe\r\n\nit is not  coincidental that  neither of the  two newsrack  cases\r\n\ndecided by the Court, Discovery Network and Plain Dealer, engaged\r                                                                  \r\n\nin a Minneapolis Star  analysis.  Indeed, none of the  cases that\r                               \r\n\nhave  dealt  with  restrictions   on  newsracks  have  found  the\r                                                         \r\n\nrestrictions to be content-based, have a content-based impact, or\r\n\notherwise  trigger strict scrutiny  because they  singled-out the\r                                                     \r\n\npress for  regulation;  in fact,  Minneapolis  Star is  not  even\r                                                             \r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nmentioned in the two  newsrack cases decided  by the Court.

While  the  Newspapers\r\n\ncomplain that  the Street  Furniture Guideline \"affects  no other\r\n\nsimilarly  situated object\"  in the  District, the  truth  of the\r\n\nmatter is that there simply is no other such object.  Not only is\r\n\nthere  no  record  evidence  that  any  other  entity--public  or\r\n\nprivate--uses  newsracks or  other  objects  that  are  similarly\r\n\nanchored to lampposts, signposts, or fixtures on the sidewalks to\r\n\ndistribute its product to the public, but there is also no record\r\n\nevidence  that such  an  entity  would  not  be  subject  to  the\r\n\nchallenged  regulation.

Contrary to  the Newspapers'\r                   \r\n\ncontentions, that exempt street  furniture, store-front signs, or\r\n\nother tangible signs of modern life may also constitute or add to\r\n\n\"visual  clutter\"  does not  necessarily render  the differential\r\n\ntreatment unjustified:  this  argument ignores legitimate, if not\r\n\nobvious,  differences  among  those  on-street  or  other visible\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nobjects  that are  essential to the  public safety  and welfare--\r\n\nstreet  and traffic  lights,  mail boxes,  fire hydrants,  street\r\n\ntrees,  traffic  and parking  signs,  trash  receptacles, parking\r\n\nmeters  and hitchposts--and the  preferred distribution  means of\r\n\nprivate  entities.

It is  safe to  assume, at least  in the  absence of\r\n\nrecord  evidence to  the  contrary, that  the newsracks'  overall\r\n\nbulky structure  is reasonably predictable as  compared to store-\r\n\nfront signs,  which lend themselves more  readily to case-by-case\r\n\nreview:   designing  the newsracks'  appearance may  reduce their\r\n\ncomplained-of  \"unsightliness\"  but it  does not  eliminate their\r\n\ncomplained-of \"congestion and inconvenience.\" \r\n\n          Perhaps most importantly, we disagree with the district\r\n\ncourt's conclusion  that,  as  in  Minneapolis  Star,  \"[s]imilar\r                                                              \r\n\nconcerns . . . in the  sense of 'censorial effects' are raised by\r\n\nthe  . . .

As  to the  Newspapers'  claim that  the\r\n\ncensorial effects of the Street Furniture Guideline extend beyond\r\n\nthe District, we find nothing in the record, other that this bald\r\n\nassertion,  to merit such a conclusion.  The allegation that this\r\n\nregulation \"sends  affected publishers  the message that  if they\r\n\ncriticize, annoy or otherwise offend any official with power over\r\n\nany  forum,  they may  face  another expensive  and  futile court\r\n\nbattle\"  implies that the  Commission has acted  in a retaliatory\r\n\nmanner by enacting this legislation, an argument which is totally\r\n\nunsupported by any evidence.\r\n\n          Finally, we  are unpersuaded  by  the Newspapers  claim\r\n\nthat, because  the regulation  deprives publishers of  an already\r\n\nsignificant and  still growing  percentage of their  readers, its\r\n\nimpact  is  hardly  \"incidental.\"    While,  as  alleged  by  the\r\n\nNewspapers, newsracks may indeed be  the \"indisputable workhorse\"\r\n\nof the daily press (a contention belied by the evidence regarding\r\n\nthe District, ante at 5 n.1), nothing in the record suggests, let\r                            \r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nalone demonstrates,  how the removal of  the District's newsracks\r\n\nis  so burdensome that it is not \"incidental.\"  As we see it, the\r\n\nNewspapers' complaint boils down  to the potential reader passing\r\n\nthrough  the District or the  non-subscribing resident and, as we\r\n\ndiscuss  later,   ample  alternative  channels   exist  for   the\r\n\nNewspapers  to  reach even  these  accidental transients  passing\r\n\nthrough  the District as well as those readers with more frequent\r\n\nties to the District.\r\n\n          In sum, we find no cognizable basis for invoking strict\r\n\nscrutiny and, thus, apply an intermediate level of scrutiny.\r\n\n  D.

The  district\r\n\ncourt  did not decide either  way.  Instead,  it took for granted\r\n\nthat the Commission satisfied the significant government interest\r\n\nprong  when  it   \"assume[d]  arguendo   that  the   Commission's\r\n\n[a]esthetic  interest  is  greater   than  that  of  the  average\r\n\ncommunity, because  [the District] has been  designated a special\r\n\nhistoric district.\"   Globe Newspaper, 847 F.

First,  and without a doubt, it  promotes the\r\n\nCommission's significant or  substantial14 government interest in\r\n\npreserving the District's aesthetics:  as the SJC observed,  \"the\r\n\n[C]ommission  has determined that  [newsracks] are inappropriate,\r\n\nin part  because they did  not exist at  the time with  which the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nCir. 1994).\r\n\n14  \"The term  'significant interest' is equivalent to  the terms\r\n'important  interest'  and  'substantial  interest,'   and  these\r\nphrases  are  often used  interchangeably.\"   Rodney A.

Second,  as the Report's review of\r                   \r\n\nthe  five  available  alternatives15 indicate,  the  Commission's\r\n\naesthetic interest  in  preserving the  District's  historic  and\r\n\narchitectural  character would  not  be achieved  as effectively,\r\n\nabsent the regulation:   banning the newsracks would effectively,\r\n\nas the  Commission's Report  observed, most completely  \"reverse\"\r\n\ntheir inappropriateness and \"be most consistent with the purposes\r\n\nof  the [D]istrict.\"16   Exhibit  H at  7.

We believe\r\nthat none of these contentions withstand scrutiny.  First, if, by\r\nrequiring  that the  Commission \"actively  consider[] alternative\r\nnewsrack design proposals,\" the dissent means to suggest that the\r\nCommission  was required  to implement  or experiment  with other\r\nalternatives  before finally  choosing the  total ban,  we simply\r\ndisagree that Discovery Network requires this.\r                                         \r\n          Second, that  the Commission  failed to send  notice of\r\nthe public hearing to  the plaintiffs' circulation departments is\r\nirrelevant  because  the  Commission  granted  a  reconsideration\r\nhearing upon the Newspapers'  request after the original  ban was\r\npromulgated.\r\n          Finally, we disagree with the dissent's last point that\r\nthe   Commission's  failure   to   regulate   newsracks   on   an\r\nindividualized  basis,  as  it  does  some  other  appurtenances,\r\ndisplays  a  decision  lacking  careful calculation.    That  the\r\nCommission  has chosen a total ban on only newsracks, and applied\r\ndifferent  measures more  relevant  to  the other  appurtenances,\r\nshows that  the Commission  made its  determination based  on the\r\ninterests and concerns uniquely related to newsracks.\r\n\n16  The dissent contends that the Commission's actions -- holding\r\ntwo public meetings, conducting a survey, publishing a study, and\r\ntaking additional testimony at the  Newspapers' request -- do not\r\nevidence a  \"carefully calculated\" determination that  the ban on\r\nnewsracks  is the  most suitable  solution \"proportionate  to the\r\nresulting  burdens  on any  protected First  Amendment activity.\"\r\nSee  post at  5-6  (citing Discovery  Network,  507 U.S.  at  416\r                                                       \r\nn.12).  The dissent  suggests that the Commission's  decision was\r\nnot  \"carefully  calculated\"  because  it  failed  to  employ  or\r\nconsider incremental, experimental alternatives to a total ban on\r\nnewsracks.  Id. at 6.  We believe, however, that the Commission's\r                         \r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nwithout burdening \"substantially more\"  speech than is necessary:\r\n\nit  does not  burden, or  otherwise adversely  affect, any  other\r\n\nmeans of distribution, including the use of street vendors in the\r\n\npublic forum.   See ante at  5 n.1.  Significantly,  we note that\r                                  \r\n\nthe  district court  acknowledged,  albeit implicitly,  that  the\r\n\nchallenged regulation  meets this test:   nowhere in  its opinion\r\n\ndid  the  district  court  conclude  that  the  Street  Furniture\r\n\nGuideline would fail to advance the Commission's interest or that\r\n\nits  interest  would  be   achieved  as  effectively  absent  the\r\n\nregulation.\r\n\n          In  reaching  our conclusion,  we  are  mindful of  the\r\n\ndistrict court's \"findings\" that the Commission's interest  could\r\n\nnot be  met  by,  say, \"subjecting  newsracks  and  other  street\r\n\nfurniture to  the same review process  as store-front merchandise\r\n\nracks,\"  and   that  it  treats  some   \"street  furniture\"  with\r\n\n\"preference.\"    Unlike the  district court,  however, we  do not\r\n\nconclude that  such findings compel a  determination--at least in\r\n\nthis   case--that   the   Street   Furniture   Guideline   burden\r\n\n\"substantially more\"  speech than is necessary  to accomplish its\r\n\npurpose  and, thus,  is narrowly  tailored.   While the  district\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nstudy, in addition to  its other actions, demonstrate that  it in\r\nfact carefully  calculated its determination  of the  alternative\r\nthat most comprehensively met  each of its interests and,  at the\r\nsame time, burdened no more speech than necessary to further this\r\ninterest.

Additionally,  we do not\r                              \r\nread National Amusements  to require the Commission  to engage in\r                                  \r\nexperimental  employment of  alternative  measures  or  otherwise\r\nengage   in  further   calculation   of   the  \"suitability\"   of\r\nalternatives  beyond that  which  its study  demonstrates it  has\r\ndone.\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\ncourt   correctly  considered   the  fact   that  less-burdensome\r\n\nalternatives  exist, it gives too much weight to that fact alone.\r\n\nIn so  doing, it essentially  discounts from the  equation Ward's\r                                                                         \r\n\ninquiry into  whether  the Street  Furniture Guideline  \"promotes\r\n\n[the Commission's  interests such] that [they]  would be achieved\r                                                                           \r\n\nless effectively absent the [Street Furniture Guideline].\"  Ward,\r                                                                          \r\n\n491 U.S. at 799 (emphasis added).17\r\n\n          We explain:    As  an  initial  matter,  the  Court  in\r\n\nDiscovery Network  explained that the existence  of \"numerous and\r                           \r\n\nobvious  less-burdensome  alternatives  .  .  .  is  certainly  a\r                                                                           \r\n\nrelevant consideration.\"  Discovery Network, 507 U.S. at 418 n.13\r                                                     \r\n\n(emphasis added).  Standing alone, this plainly means that, while\r\n\n\"certainly a relevant consideration,\"  id., it is not necessarily\r                                                    \r\n\na  controlling  one:  i.e.,  that  \"numerous  and  obvious  less-\r                                    \r\n\nburdensome alternatives\" exist does  not automatically compel the\r\n\nconclusion that a regulation  burdens \"substantially more\" speech\r\n\nthan is  necessary.  When read in light of Ward, it becomes clear\r                                                         \r\n\nthat   less-burdensome  alternatives   must   be  considered   in\r\n\nconnection with  the inquiry into whether,  absent the challenged\r                                                                           \r\n\nregulation,   the  government's   interests  are   achieved  less\r                                                                           \r\n\neffectively.

In this regard, it also noted that the \"benefit to\r                      \r\n\nbe  derived from the removal  of 62 newsracks  while about 1,500-\r\n\n2,000 remain in place  was considered 'minute' by  the [d]istrict\r\n\n[c]ourt and 'paltry' by the [c]ourt of [a]ppeals.\"  Id. \r                                                                 \r\n\n          Unlike the  city  in Discovery  Network,  however,  the\r                                                           \r\n\nCommission's actions since newsracks  became a subject of concern\r\n\nin  the  early  1980s   --including  survey,  report  and  public\r\n\nhearings-- demonstrate that it carefully calculated the costs and\r\n\nbenefits.  The path it chose to follow--eliminating the newsracks\r\n\naltogether--is  the most  effective  solution  aimed at  reducing\r\n\nvisual clutter and preserving the  District's historic character.\r\n\nDesigning the newsracks to better \"blend in\" and conform with the\r\n\nDistrict's architectural  and historic character  by having, say,\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nan  \"old-fashioned\"   or  colonial  \"look,\"  would   promote  the\r\n\nCommission's  interest by  reducing  their  \"unsightliness.\"   It\r\n\nwould  not achieve,  however,  as effective  a reduction  in \"the\r\n\nvisual clutter created by their presence on the sidewalks [which]\r\n\nclearly detracts from the historic and architectural character of\r\n\nthe   [D]istrict,\"18  or,  for  that  matter,  the  long-standing\r\n\nconcerns regarding \"congestion and inconvenience.\" \r\n\n          Our  conclusion  is  not   swayed  by  the  Newspapers'\r\n\nprotestations that the Street  Furniture Guideline, as applied to\r\n\nCharles  Street (the most commercial in the District), is a \"lost\r\n\ncause\"  and that the regulation  does not remove  all evidence of\r\n\nmodern life.   It is also not influenced  by the district court's\r\n\nfinding  that there has been  \"no showing that  newsracks are any\r\n\nmore inherently  out of keeping with  the architectural character\r\n\nof the [D]istrict than other modern innovations.\"19  847 F. Supp.\r\n\nat  194-95.   These  contentions  miss the  point.    As the  SJC\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n18  See The Report, Exhibit H at 2.\r                 \r\n\n19   In any event,  we disagree  with this observation.   As  the\r\nAgreed  Statement  of  Facts  indicates,  the  District's  street\r\npattern includes many narrow  pedestrian streets and lanes.   The\r\nnewsracks, which  began to appear on the  scene in the 1980s, are\r\nobviously out of character with the District's street pattern and\r\nit is utterly irrelevant that some  streets may not be as  narrow\r\nas they once were.  Furthermore, as the Agreed Statement of Facts\r\nevidences,  much  of the  exempt  \"street  furniture\" that  would\r\nconstitute  \"other  modern  innovations\"  was  installed  in  the\r\nDistrict  long before newsracks came on the scene and, indeed, in\r\nsome  cases apparently prior to  the creation of  the District in\r\n1995.   That said, we reiterate that this observation ignores the\r\nobvious differences between the public  safety/welfare structures\r\nproviding indispensable services  and private structures  erected\r\non public  property whose function, although  no doubt important,\r\ncan  be served  in ways  that do  not require  \"appropriation\" of\r\npublic property.\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\ncorrectly  observed, \"the  [C]ommission's charge  is to  preserve\r\n\nwhat it can of  the . . .

In  any event, we dismiss  as\r\n\ndisingenuous  the  Newspapers'  suggestion  that  the  challenged\r\n\nregulation  is not part of a \"comprehensive\" plan because it does\r\n\nnot  ban all \"street furniture\"  or all evidence  of modern life:\r\n\nnot  only is the  Street Furniture Guideline  consistent with its\r\n\nlong-standing   prohibition   against  freestanding   signs,  the\r\n\nCommission's  guidelines,  review  process,  decisions  regarding\r\n\ncable  television control boxes and traffic control boxes, not to\r\n\nmention its thorough approach  regarding newsracks, all speak for\r\n\nthemselves.

The  Vincent Court  compared the  sign ban  to the\r                                     \r\n\nordinance banning handbilling to address littering problems  that\r\n\nthe Court struck down in Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147 (1939).\r                                                     \r\n\nIn making its  determination that  the total ban  in Vincent  was\r                                                                      \r\n\nnarrowly  tailored   to  serve   the  government's   interest  in\r\n\naesthetics,   the  Court   distinguished   between  the   state's\r\n\nunconstitutional exercise  of police power to  regulate litter by\r\n\nprohibiting the distribution of handbills and  the constitutional\r\n\nexercise of  that power  to completely eliminate  the substantive\r\n\nevil addressed.  Unlike  the situation of littering, the  evil in\r\n\nVincent,  as here,  \"is not  merely a  possible byproduct  of the\r                 \r\n\n[protected expressive]  activity, but is created by the medium of\r\n\nexpression itself.\"   Id. at 810.   The Court held  that, because\r                                   \r\n\nthe Vincent regulation directly resolved the evil the city sought\r                     \r\n\nto address, the medium of expression, the regulation was narrowly\r\n\ntailored to the city's interest in aesthetics and limiting visual\r\n\nblight.   Id.   Similarly,  the Commission's  ban on  the use  of\r                       \r\n\nprivate newsracks,  which are both  the exact evil  presented and\r\n\nthe medium of  expression, is narrowly tailored to the government\r\n\ninterest  in  eliminating the  visual  blight  and congestion  on\r\n\npublic property caused by that evil.\r\n\n          Moreover,  unlike cases where  the medium of expression\r\n\ninvolves the exercise  of speech  by an individual  or where  the\r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\nmedium is  a uniquely  valuable  mode of  expression, see,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nLadue,      U.S. at    , 114  S. Ct. at 2045  (citing cases), the\r               \r\n\nmedium  of  expression  here is  the  use  of  a privately  owned\r\n\nstructure  placed on  public property  for which,  as  we discuss\r\n\nbelow,  there are  ample alternative  channels available  for the\r\n\ndistribution of the Newspapers' publications.\r\n\n          In sum, we conclude--contrary  to the district  court--\r\n\nthat the Street Furniture Guideline is narrowly tailored.\r\n\n          The Final Hurdle:  Ample Alternative Channels?\r                    The Final Hurdle:  Ample Alternative Channels?\r\n\n          The district  court did  not reach this  final prong,20\r\n\nbut  we  must  before  the   full  First  Amendment  analysis  is\r\n\ncompleted.\r\n\n          Below, and on appeal,  the Commission claims that ample\r\n\nalternative channels exist.  The challenged regulation, it points\r\n\nout,  leaves   unaffected  the   Newspapers'  primary   means  of\r\n\ndistribution  within  the  District:   home  delivery,  sales  by\r\n\nstores,  street vendors,  and mail.

Further still,  it is\r\n\nundisputed that no point  within the District is more  than 1,000\r\n\nfeet  (approximately 1/5 of a mile) from a source of publications\r\n\nand  that adjacent  to the  District numerous  additional sources\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n20  Although the district court found that the PDG  did not leave\r\nopen ample  alternative channels  for free publications,  such as\r\nthe  TAB, it  did  not make  this  finding regarding  the  Street\r\nFurniture Guideline.\r\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\nexist,  including  newsracks:21   this,  it  emphasizes, is  well\r\n\nwithin  the  1/4  mile  distance that  the  Sixth  Circuit  found\r\n\nsufficient in Plain Dealer when it upheld a ban on newsracks in a\r                                    \r\n\nresidential neighborhood.

Given that  the regulation  neither\r\n\naffects the TAB's primary means of  distribution, the mail, which\r\n\naccounts  for 79% of its  distribution, nor prohibits  the use of\r\n\nstreet vendors, such  \"practical boundaries\" exist here.   In any\r\n\nevent, absent  any record  evidence regarding the  feasibility or\r\n\ninfeasibility of  street vending  for free publications,  such as\r\n\nthe TAB, we are particularly reluctant to treat free publications\r\n\ndifferently than those  \"for charge,\" or  to otherwise alter  our\r\n\nconclusion. \r\n\n          In short,  \"[a]s the Court phrased it: 'That the city's\r\n\nlimitations on volume  may reduce  to some  degree the  potential\r\n\naudience  for respondent's speech is of no consequence, for there\r\n\nhas been no  showing that the remaining  avenues of communication\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n25    When the  district  court made  its  bench ruling  that the\r\noriginal regulation did not leave open ample alternative channels\r\nit noted that  \"there is a special  problem\" with respect  to the\r\nimpact upon free  publications, such  as the TAB.   Although  the\r\nNewspapers had not raised  this issue and despite the  absence of\r\nrecord evidence, the district court's conclusion was based on the\r\nassumption that stores would not have the same economic incentive\r\nto serve  as conduits for the distribution  of free publications.\r\nDespite the  subsequent admission  of evidence showing  that \"no-\r\ncharge\" publications  were carried in the  District's stores, the\r\ncourt  did  not  abandon its  \"finding\"  on  this  point when  it\r\nreconsidered  its  ruling on  the new  regulation.

Here, because the SFG leaves  intact an\r              \r\n\nalternative means of distribution within the public forum, and in\r\n\nthe  absence of  any record  evidence \"call[ing]  into legitimate\r\n\nquestion   the    adequacy   of   the    alternate   routes   for\r\n\n[distribution],\" National Amusements, 43 F.3d at 745, we conclude\r                                              \r\n\nthat the Street Furniture  Guideline's effective ban on newsracks\r\n\nin no way runs afoul of  the Newspapers' First Amendment right to\r\n\ndistribute their publications.  Accordingly, with this last prong\r\n\nsatisfied, we  find that  the challenged guideline  passes muster\r\n\nunder the First  Amendment:  it is  a reasonable, content-neutral\r\n\ntime, place  and manner restriction  on the Newspapers'  right to\r\n\ndistribute their publications in the District.\r\n\n                     Some Additional Thoughts\r                               Some Additional Thoughts\r\n\n          We have considered the  Newspapers' other arguments and\r\n\nfind them  to be without  merit.   We pause briefly,  however, to\r\n\nrespond to a few of them.\r\n\n          First:    Contrary  to  their contention,  and  as  the\r\n\nforegoing discussion makes clear, the Street Furniture  Guideline\r\n\nin  no  way  denies the  Newspapers  the  ability  to make  their\r\n\npublications  available  to  those  \"willing  to  receive\"  them.\r\n\nIndeed, there is  simply nothing  in the record  to support  this\r\n\nbald assertion.  \r\n\n          Second:   We also reject  as utterly without  merit the\r\n\nnotion that, by upholding a ruling that bans  a common and useful\r\n\nmeans  of newspaper  distribution, our  decision today  opens the\r\n\n                               -44-\r\r\n\ndoor to the \"piecemeal destruction of the public forum.\"  We  are\r\n\nsimply at  a loss to see  how the public forum  is \"destroyed\" by\r\n\nsuch a valid content neutral, time, place and  manner restriction\r\n\non  the distribution of  protected speech--particularly where, as\r\n\nhere, the  Newspapers are  free to distribute  their publications\r\n\nfrom  the  very same  spot within  the  public forum  where their\r\n\nnewsracks have been located.  \r\n\n          Last, but  not least:   We also  dismiss as  irrelevant\r\n\ntheir  claim  that  the  SJC's  decision  signals  a  danger  for\r\n\nnewsracks in all  historic districts:  even if this were true, as\r\n\nlong as  the regulations are  valid content neutral,  time, place\r\n\nand manner restrictions,  what of it?  As  noted above, while the\r\n\nFirst Amendment guarantees  the right to  circulate publications,\r\n\nit  does not  guarantee  the  right  to  do  so  through  private\r\n\nstructures erected  on public  property.   No  one disputes  that\r\n\nregulations  governing newsracks,  because  they  facilitate  the\r\n\ndistribution of protected speech,  are subject to First Amendment\r\n\nscrutiny.    What  the  Newspapers fail  to  appreciate  is  that\r\n\nnewsracks  are nothing  more  than structures  occupying, if  not\r\n\nmonopolizing, public  space  on  the  sidewalks,  which--with  or\r\n\nwithout  publications  within--simply   are  not  immunized  from\r\n\nregulations passing muster under the First Amendment.  \r\n\n          In  sum, our  opinion  today stands  unaffected by  the\r\n\nclatter of these alarmist  claims.  Without more ado,  we reverse\r\n\nthe district court's decision.\r\n\n                       II.  Attorney's Fees\r                                 II.

In  light of our  opinion today\r\n\nreversing the judgment below  on the merits, we need  not address\r\n\nthe Commission's  claims of error.  As a judgment in favor of the\r\n\nNewspapers  is reversed on the merits,  that party is no longer a\r\n\n\"prevailing  party\" under 42 U.S.C.    1988 and,  thus, no longer\r\n\nentitled to attorney's fees under that statute.

The  Commission is  required first  to\r\n\ndemonstrate  that  it  carefully  considered  obvious alternative\r\n\nregulatory  means before  imposing its  outright ban  against all\r\n\nnewsracks within the  District.   See Cincinnati, 113  S. Ct.  at\r                                                          \r\n\n1510 n.13 (rejecting  \"mere rational basis review\").   The record\r\n\ndoes not demonstrate that the Commission has met its burden.\r\n\n          By the  same token, the unquestionable  efficiency of a\r\n\ntotal  ban  on  all  newsracks  does  not   satisfy  the  \"narrow\r                    \r\n\ntailoring\" requirement.   Otherwise, there would  be virtually no\r\n\nrole  left  to be  served  by the  requirement  that governmental\r\n\nentities  \"carefully  calculate\"  the  burdens  their  regulatory\r\n\nactions impose on protected expressive  activity, see id. at 1510\r                                                                   \r\n\nn.12,  since an  outright ban will  almost invariably  prove most\r\n\nefficient in  rooting out  unbecoming  appurtenances.   Moreover,\r\n\nunlike  public-safety  regulations, for  example, esthetics-based\r\n\nregulations often  stem from  subjective assessments  not readily\r\n\namenable either to objective measurement or empirical refutation,\r\n\nthereby warranting careful  judicial scrutiny.

Charles  Street,  for\r\n\nexample,  accommodates  numerous  modern commercial  conveniences\r\n\n(e.g., gas stations) presumably  alien, if not offensive,  to the\r               \r\n\nesthetic sensibilities of even the most indurate \"old Bostonian.\"\r\n\nThus,  notwithstanding the  Commission  mandate  to preserve  the\r\n\nDistrict's colonial and post-colonial  characteristics, residents\r\n\nrely  upon   (or   at  least   tolerate)  many   uncharacteristic\r\n\nobtrusions,  at  least  one  of which  (cable  television  boxes)\r\n\npresumably  was  introduced   after  the  Commission   came  into\r\n\nexistence in 1955.  Various other anachronous utilities abound as\r\n\nwell    including paved roads and sidewalks, automobiles, traffic\r\n\nsignals, streetlights,  trash receptacles,  mail boxes,  and fire\r\n\nhydrants     not  only along  Charles  Street but  throughout the\r\n\nDistrict.   Even though  many of these  nonconforming modernities\r\n\nare  regulated by the Commission    often robustly    rather than\r                                                                           \r\n\nbanned outright,  the Commission concedes that  newsracks are the\r                         \r\n\nonly \"street furniture\" it subjects to an outright ban.  \r\n\n          As the district  court correctly noted, there can be no\r\n\nquestion that  an outright  ban on all  nonconforming modernities\r\n\n(e.g., as at Plymouth Plantation or Williamsburg) offers the most\r               \r\n\nefficient  approach to  restoring  historical  and  architectural\r\n\nintegrity.   Where  the First  Amendment is  implicated, however,\r\n\n                               -49-\r\r\n\nefficient  governmental regulation  must be  \"narrowly tailored.\"\r\n\nYet  the  Commission  neither demonstrates  that  \"obvious  less-\r\n\nburdensome alternatives\" are unavailable, Cincinnati,  113 S.

Plainly, these  obvious alternatives, if efficacious,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ncolor, location,  and attachment;  and (5) delaying  any District\r\nregulation  pending  the  City's  decision  whether  to  regulate\r\nnewsracks city-wide.  The  Staff Report fails to  demonstrate the\r\nrequired \"narrow tailoring,\" for three reasons.  \r\n    First,  the  Report was  based  solely  on  surveys of  then-\r                                                                           \r\nexisting newsracks, see  Commission Staff Report, at 65 (\"None of\r                                 \r\nthe distribution  box designs can  be said to  be architecturally\r\nappropriate\"),  and  does  not  consider  the  feasibility  of  a\r\ndifferent  newsrack  design  more  consonant   with  the  desired\r\nesthetics.   Indeed, the analysis of Alternative #4 merely states\r\nthat any such design criteria would have  \"to be drafted\" at some\r\nlater time.   See id.  at 68.   This plainly  does not amount  to\r                              \r\n\"careful calculation.\"\r\n\n    Second,  the Commission  points to  no other  record evidence\r\nthat  it  ever actively  considered  alternative  newsrack design\r\nproposals.  Even though the  Commission now acknowledges that  it\r\nfailed to send notice of its November 15, 1990, public hearing to\r                               \r\nplaintiffs' respective circulation  departments, the Staff Report\r\ntouts  the fact  that,  after years  of  public opposition  to  a\r\nnewsrack ban, plaintiffs  had lodged  no comments  at the  public\r\nhearing.  In a  letter to the Commission shortly after  the first\r\nguideline  was promulgated,  however, the  Boston Globe  not only\r\nobjected to the \"notice\" provided by the Commission, but reminded\r\nthe Commission of the Globe's \"historical willingness\" throughout\r\nthe preceding eight-year period to negotiate a mutually agreeable\r\nnewsrack guideline short of a total ban. \r\n\n    Finally, the  Report rejects  Alternatives 2-4 on  the ground\r\nthat  they  would   tax  the  Commission's  limited   enforcement\r\nresources.  Administrative burden is an appropriate consideration\r\nin the  \"careful calculation\"  inquiry.  Yet  even accepting  the\r\nCommission's    uncorroborated    reference   to    its   limited\r\nadministrative resources,  it fails because  it simply  presumes,\r\nsub  silentio,  that the  expressive  activity  here involved  is\r                       \r\nsomehow  due less  protection than the  anachronous appurtenances\r\nthe  Commission  has decided  to regulate,  but  not to  ban, and\r\ntherefore that  it is less deserving  of individualized treatment\r\nunder the Commission's ad  hoc permitting process.  Nor  does the\r                                        \r\nReport  attempt a  comprehensive overview  of current  Commission\r\nadministrative   enforcement   expenditures   relating   to   its\r\nregulation of these other unhistorical appurtenances.  \r\n\n                               -51-\r\r\n\nwould be much  less burdensome on  the important First  Amendment\r\n\nexpressive activity the Commission proposes to ban outright.\r\n\n          As  the court  appropriately  acknowledges, of  course,\r\n\nconsiderable deference is due  the Commission.  See supra  p. 31.\r                                                                   \r\n\n          Nevertheless, deference to an outright ban on protected\r\n\nexpressive activity  cannot be predicated on anything less than a\r\n\nreasoned  showing  that  the  Commission  \"carefully  calculated\"\r\n\nalternative means  with a  view to their  suitability to  address\r\n\nlegitimate  regulatory interests  proportionate to  the resulting\r                                                         \r\n\nburdens on  any protected First Amendment  activity.

On the other  hand, \"narrow tailoring\"  in the present\r                \r\n\ncontext  does not  require the  government  to employ  the \"least\r\n\nrestrictive  means,\"  but  to  demonstrate  that   it  \"carefully\r\n\ncalculated\"  the suitability of obvious alternatives proportional\r                                      \r\n\nto its legitimate esthetic objectives.  Each case is to be judged\r\n\non its particular  facts, of course, and  a total ban  might pass\r\n\nmuster  were it  made to  appear that  the  Commission \"carefully\r\n\ncalculated\"  less burdensome  alternatives and  justifiably found\r\n\nthem wanting.\r\n\n          The  failure  to  make  such a  showing  is  especially\r\n\nflagrant  in the present context, since the Commission settled on\r\n\n                               -53-\r\r\n\na  total  ban because  newsracks  were  unknown in  post-colonial\r\n\ntimes,  yet  it  continues  to  regulate,  rather  than  prohibit\r\n\noutright,    numerous   post-colonial    appurtenances,   without\r\n\nexplaining  why a  newsrack  need inevitably  be more  unbecoming\r\n\nhistorically  and architecturally  than a  trash receptacle  or a\r\n\nstreetlight  pole.   If  its response  is  merely that  the trash\r\n\nreceptacle or streetlight pole serves a more useful purpose which\r\n\nmust  somehow   be  tolerated,  then  the   Commission  seriously\r\n\nundervalues  both  the  utility  of  expressive  activity  (i.e.,\r                                                                         \r\n\nnewspaper  distribution)  and the  First Amendment  protection to\r\n\nwhich it is entitled.

In 1981, it formally adopted the policies as \"guidelines.\"   The guidelines regulate exterior architectural features such as masonry, roofs, windows, sash and shutters, doors, trim, paint, and ironwork.  One of the guidelines states that \"[f]reestanding signs are not permitted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs distribute their newspapers in the District via home delivery, store sales, street vendors, and \"newsracks.\"   Newsracks are newspaper distribution boxes painted in various colors and featuring the name of the newspaper and other advertising logos.  They are commonly anchored to lampposts, signposts, or fixtures on the sidewalk.  The plaintiffs maintain a total of thirty-nine newsracks in the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newsracks were first introduced to the District in the early 1980s.  By 1983, Beacon Hill residents had begun to complain of the \"unsightliness, congestion and inconvenience associated with the vending machines.\"   Although the Commission believed that the newsracks violated the guideline prohibiting free-standing signs, it took no enforcement action because a city-wide regulation of newsracks was being discussed in the early 1980s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, no regulation having been adopted, the Beacon Hill Civic Association petitioned the Commission for a guideline to exclude newsracks from the District.  On February 21, 1991, the Commission adopted the following guideline:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Publication distribution boxes (any boxes placed on the sidewalks to distribute publications, whether for charge or not) visible from a public way are not allowed within the District.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 1, 1991, the Commission notified the plaintiffs of the new guideline.  One month later, it requested that the plaintiffs remove their newsracks by June 1, 1991.  The plaintiffs have not applied for any certificates of appropriateness.  The parties agree however that, given the blanket ban imposed by the guideline, filing an application for such a certificate with the Commission would have been a futile exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed this action in district court on August 28, 1991, seeking declaratory relief, damages, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief from the publication distribution guideline, which allegedly violated their First Amendment right to distribute newspapers on Beacon Hill.  Following a bench trial on stipulated facts, the court ruled from the bench that the publication distribution guideline offended the First Amendment.  The guideline, \"instead of being narrowly tailored with respect to the limitation on speech[,] is narrowly tailored to focus only on speech.  It applies to no form of visual clutter other than public[ation] distribution boxes....\"  Significantly, the trial judge was \"troubled whether there is statutory authority for the particular kind of legislative rule making\" illustrated by the guideline.  He did not decide the case on state law grounds, however, because \"the questions about the Architectural Commission's authority are at least debatable on the present record ... and perhaps would require some supplementation of the record in order for the Court to resolve them....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before judgment had entered, the Commission adopted a new guideline that bans all \"street furniture\"--not just publication distribution boxes--from the District:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Street furniture, as defined below, shall not be permitted in the Historic Beacon Hill District with the exception of approved store-front merchandise stands and those structures erected or placed by authorized public agencies for public safety and/or public welfare purposes.  Street furniture is defined as any structure erected or placed in the public or private ways on a temporary or permanent basis.  Authorized public safety/public welfare street furniture includes, but is not limited to, such structures as street lights, traffic lights, mail boxes, fire hydrants, street trees, and trash receptacles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Any such authorized public safety/public welfare street furniture or approved store-front merchandise stands shall be subject to Commission review and shall be in keeping with the architectural and historic character of the District and the criteria for exterior architectural features as specified in Chapter 616 of the Acts of 1955 as amended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission moved for reconsideration of the judgment, arguing that the new guideline is free from the constitutional defects of the old.  The district judge found that the new guideline fared no better under the First Amendment.  See Globe Newspaper v. Beacon Hill Architectural Comm'n, 847 F.Supp. 178 (D.Mass.1994).  This time, however, he held that the Commission lacked authority under Massachusetts law to adopt the street furniture guideline.  We examine the state law portion of the opinion in detail, and ultimately certify the issue of the Commission's rulemaking authority to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE COMMISSION'S RULEMAKING AUTHORITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Are newsracks \"structures\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the beginning of this litigation, the plaintiffs have insisted that only buildings are \"structures\" with \"exterior architectural features,\" and that newsracks are not \"structures\" within the Commission's jurisdiction.  They now also claim that the Commission lacks authority to regulate anything on the sidewalks or streets of Beacon Hill.  This new argument merely restates the threshold issue--are newsracks \"structures\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court so assumed without deciding.  Although the plaintiffs' reading of \"structure\" presented \"a close and rather curious question,\" Judge Keeton noted that the examples of \"structure\" given in the uniform state building code include tents, platforms, bins, and even flagpoles--none of which would be \"structures\" in the sense urged by the plaintiffs.  Id. at 183.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To complicate matters, the guidelines themselves seem to ratify the plaintiffs' interpretation.  The introduction to the guidelines states in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>[T]he statute authorizes the Beacon Hill Architectural Commission to review proposed changes to the exterior architectural features of buildings within the historic district.... Owners contemplating changes to the exterior of any building within the ... District should be aware that no alteration will be approved that is inappropriate to the historical character, architectural design, and materials of the building or its setting [emphasis added].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, like the district court, find the interpretation of \"structure\" to be a close question.  It is unnecessary to resolve this threshold issue, however, because we have decided to certify to the SJC the ultimate question of the Commission's authority to adopt the street furniture guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Substantive rulemaking authority</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the distinction between substantive and procedural rulemaking is not entirely clear, it seems clear enough in the context of this case.  The district court defined substantive rulemaking authority as the power to \"adopt rules that state substantive criteria for determining whether individual applications will be granted.\"  Globe Newspaper, 847 F.Supp. at 183.   The street furniture guideline is a substantive rule.  It makes plain that nothing can be done to make private \"street furniture\" appropriate to the District.  In other words, applications for certificates of appropriateness will be denied whenever the structure involved is a piece of private street furniture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does the Commission have the power to adopt substantive rules?   The 1965 amendment to Sec. 4 of the Act provides in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>The commission may adopt, amend and repeal rules for the regulation of its affairs and the conduct of its business[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1965 Mass.Acts c. 429, Sec. 2.  The district court interpreted this amendment as authority for procedural rulemaking only.  The Commission argues that this reading reduces the amendment to surplusage;  it reasons as follows.  During its first ten years (1955-65), the Commission could not have carried out its statutory mandate if it lacked the implied power to make procedural rules for the conduct of its hearings, the filing and processing of applications, and the assignment of its staff.  Therefore, the 1965 amendment necessarily added something new:  the power to adopt substantive rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken at face value, this argument suggests that any time a governmental entity is expressly authorized to adopt rules, and the language of the authorization is not expressly limited to procedural rulemaking, the entity has been granted substantive rulemaking power.  We doubt that the truth is quite so simple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law at the time of the 1965 amendment does not dispel our doubt.  The district court cited several cases for the proposition that the phrase \"conduct of its business\" was commonly used to refer to matters of procedure and internal management.  See Insurance Co. of North Am. v. Commissioner of Ins., 327 Mass. 745, 101 N.E.2d 335, 338 (1951) (commissioner of insurance shall grant license to an entity that has adopted \"by-laws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business\");  Burt v. Municipal Council of Taunton, 275 Mass. 535, 176 N.E. 511 (1931) (municipal order creating a bidding process for city contracts is a rule for \"the conduct of the general business affairs of the city\");  Tapper v. Boston Chamber of Commerce, 249 Mass. 235, 144 N.E. 89 (1924) (directors may fix a reasonable charge for use of Chamber facilities, based on their authority to adopt rules \"for the government and proper business conduct of the Chamber\").  None of the cases, however, addresses the dichotomy between substantive and procedural rulemaking, or explicitly states that the defendant could adopt only procedural rules.  It is one thing to say that the phrase \"conduct of its business\" has been held to authorize a given procedural rule;  it is quite another to say that the phrase authorizes procedural rules alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final case cited by the district court, Farnham v. Lenox Motor Car Co., 229 Mass. 478, 118 N.E. 874 (1918), held that the superior court's rules \"regulating practice and procedure, expediting the trial of causes and the general conduct of its business\" do not overcome the parties' constitutional right to have controverted facts decided by a jury.  No court rule, substantive or procedural, could have changed the outcome in Farnham. Lacking controlling authority in the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, we find it fairly debatable whether the Act expressly confers substantive rulemaking power on the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission draws an analogy between its own rulemaking authority and that conferred by Mass.Gen.L. c. 40C, the general law authorizing cities and towns to establish historic districts.  Section 10(e) of c. 40C provides in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>The Commission ... may adopt and amend such rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this act and prescribe such forms as it shall deem desirable and necessary for the regulation of its affairs and the conduct of its business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The comparison seems strained.  First, the Commission cites no authority for its claim that the language of Sec. 10(e) \"is very clearly substantive rulemaking authority.\"   Second, the phrase \"not inconsistent with the provisions of this act\" does not appear in the Beacon Hill Act.  As the Commission acknowledges, the rulemaking language in c. 40C is \"similar but not identical to that in the Commission's statute.\"   We find nothing conclusive in the comparison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Is the guideline consistent with the Act?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the Act expressly or implicitly authorizes substantive rulemaking,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a reviewing court has to determine whether the street furniture guideline is consistent with the Act.  No agency can adopt a substantive rule that clashes with substantive requirements found in its own enabling statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 7 of the Act, which we quoted earlier, sets forth a list of factors that the Commission \"shall consider,\" in addition to \"any other pertinent factors,\" in passing upon an application for a certificate of appropriateness (emphasis added):  e.g., \"the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the exterior architectural feature involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district judge's view, the street furniture guideline flouts the mandate of 1955 Mass.Acts Sec. 7 because it bans all newsracks without regard to the setting or the exterior architectural features of any particular newsrack.  Most of the other guidelines deal with the mutable characteristics of structures;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  the street furniture guideline bans the structures themselves.  In effect, the Commission will no longer consider the exterior architectural features of street furniture on a case-by-case basis.  Yet the guidelines are prefaced by this comment:  \"Each application is considered on its individual merits, but the Beacon Hill Architectural Commission will act in accordance with the following guidelines[.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission replies that it has a mandate to make aesthetic judgments to \"preserv[e]\" and \"maintain\" the historic Beacon Hill District in accordance with the purpose of the Act.  Sec.  2.  Aesthetic judgments involve, to some extent, the exercise of sound discretion.  Although the Commission's idea of good taste is not all that matters under the Act, the legislature has arguably vested the Commission with broad discretion to decide the appropriateness of whole classes of exterior architectural features, and even whole classes of structures, if necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CERTIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We previously denied the Commission's motion to certify the question of its authority to adopt the street furniture guideline to the SJC.  The denial, which was provisional, was based in part on the Commission's failure to request certification below.  For the reasons that follow, we now certify the question on our own motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the state law issues in this case may be determinative.  We have found no controlling authority in the SJC's decisions, and \"the course [the] state court[ ] would take\" is not \"reasonably clear.\"  Nieves v. University of Puerto Rico, 7 F.3d 270, 275 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Porter v. Nutter, 913 F.2d 37, 41 n. 4 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, significant concerns of federal-state comity have been raised here.  Soon after the publication distribution guideline was adopted, the Commission requested that all newsracks be removed from Beacon Hill.  The plaintiffs brought this action without having filed applications for certificates of appropriateness.  Although there is no doubt that the applications would have been denied, the Massachusetts courts were deprived of an opportunity to review the decisions of the Commission for factual and legal sufficiency.  Where, as here, the parties have bypassed a state procedure that would have permitted a state court to decide an issue of state law on which there is no controlling authority, certification of the issue serves our \"concern to promote federal-state comity....\"  Fischer, 857 F.2d at 7 n. 2 (quoting White v. Edgar, 320 A.2d 668, 675 (Me.1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the delays of certification will not prejudice the parties.  The Commission itself, albeit belatedly, moved for certification.  The plaintiffs' newsracks will not be disturbed unless there is a final judgment by this court reversing the judgment below.  We therefore need not rush to decide a difficult First Amendment issue in order to prevent the chilling of protected speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the state law issues in this case may have ramifications for other governmental entities that derive their rulemaking authority from similar statutory language.  Home rule is a matter of peculiarly state and local concern.  Where possible, state courts should rule in the first instance on the scope of local governmental authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are rarely \"receptive to ... requests for certification newly asserted on appeal,\" Nieves, 7 F.3d at 278, in an appropriate case we may certify an issue of state law on our own motion.  See Maine Drilling and Blasting, Inc. v. Insurance Co. of North Am., 34 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1994).  We do so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A question certified to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, with jurisdiction retained pending that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CERTIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed in Globe Newspaper Co., et al. v. Beacon Hill Architectural Commission, No. 94-1538, a question of Massachusetts law on which we are unable to find clear, controlling precedent in the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts may be determinative in this case.  Accordingly, we certify the following question to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts pursuant to its Rule 1:03--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>Did the Beacon Hill Architectural Commission have authority under 1955 Mass.Acts c. 616 (as amended) to adopt the \"Street Furniture Guideline\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated and discussed the facts relevant to the question certified in Globe Newspaper Co.   We, of course, welcome the advice or comment of the Supreme Judicial Court on any other question of Massachusetts law it deems material to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clerk will transmit this question and our opinion in this case, along with copies of the briefs, exhibits, and appendix to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On appeal, the Commission has not argued (as it did before the district court) that, even absent express authorization in the Act, the Commission has implied authority to adopt substantive rules because it has been vested with \"broad discretion and flexibility.\"   See Commission Brief at 21 (\"Since the 1965 amendment provides express power for substantive rulemaking, the only question to be answered is whether or not the Street Furniture Guideline is within the express authority granted\").  The Commission's argument of implied authority would normally be deemed waived on appeal.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).  Because we are certifying the issue of the Commission's rulemaking authority to the SJC, the SJC remains free to address arguments that we might ignore.  Cf. Fischer v. Bar Harbor Banking and Trust Co., 857 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1018, 109 S.Ct. 1135, 103 L.Ed.2d 196 (1989) (failure to raise an issue before the district court does not necessarily prevent this court from certifying the issue to the state supreme court)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., \"Roofs and Roof Structures\" Guideline no. 5 (\"[u]npainted mill-finished aluminum is inappropriate\" for \"flashing, gutters, and downspouts\");  \"Windows, Sash and Shutters\" Guideline no. 4 (\"[o]nly clear-paned, non-tinted glass shall be used....\").  A significant exception is the guideline banning freestanding signs, the authority for which the district court also questioned</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The parties also make several pragmatic arguments as to whether a ban on newsracks serves the purposes of the Act.  The Commission asserts that there is no historical precedent for the newsracks.  \"[T]he visual clutter created by their presence on the sidewalks ... clearly detracts from the historic and architectural character of the district.\"   Moreover, the newsracks have \"accumulated ... to the point that pedestrian access is being significantly restricted.\"   Based on its experience and expertise, and its mandate to promote the \"educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the public through the preservation of the historic Beacon Hill district,\" 1955 Mass.Acts Sec. 2, the Commission made a reasonable judgment that newsracks and other types of street furniture are not appropriate to the district</p>\n        <p>The plaintiffs counter that the streets and sidewalks of Beacon Hill, in 1955 as well as today, bear no resemblance to their Nineteenth Century precursors.  The public way is already crowded with innovations such as automobiles, paved roads, traffic lights, parking meters, and parking signs;  \"there was and is little or no history to preserve on the streets and sidewalks of Beacon Hill.\"   The aesthetics of the streets and sidewalks were \"a lost cause\" even before the first newsracks arrived.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The Act is intended to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>promote the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the public through the preservation of the historic Beacon Hill district, and to maintain said district as a landmark in the history of architecture and as a tangible reminder of old Boston as it existed in the early days of the commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1955 Mass.Acts c. 616, Sec. 2.  The historical significance of the Beacon Hill District can hardly be doubted.  As the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>The [Beacon Hill] area was closely built up for the homes of persons of taste and culture in the architectural style of urban residences prevailing a century or more ago....  [T]he Beacon Hill section, with some exceptions, has remained to this day rather surprisingly free from inharmonious intrusions.  Its general appearance is substantially what it was several generations ago.  The Bulfinch front, so-called, of the State House, completed before the year 1800, is at the highest point of the hill.  The famous Boston Common is located on the other side of Beacon Street, opposite the southerly boundary of the ... district.  The area has contained the homes of many persons of distinction in the life of the State and Nation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Opinion of the Justices, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></span>, 786-87, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span> </span>(1955).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant-appellant, Beacon Hill Architectural Commission, was created to review proposed changes to \"exterior architectural feature[s]\" within the District.  1955 Mass.Acts c. 616, Sec. 7.  An \"exterior architectural feature\" is defined as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>the architectural style and general arrangement of such portion of the exterior of a structure as is designed to be open to view from a public way, including kind, color and texture of the building material of such portion and type of all windows, doors, lights, signs, and other fixtures appurtenant to such portion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at Sec. </span>3.  Only \"structure[s]\" have exterior architectural features within the meaning of the act.  The term \"structure,\" the parties agree, is defined by reference to Mass.Gen.L. c. 143, Sec. 1 (in lieu of the Boston Building Code, which no longer exists) as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>a combination of materials assembled at a fixed location to give support or shelter, such as a building, framework, retaining wall, tent, reviewing stand, platform, bin, fence, sign, flagpole, recreational tramway, mast for radio antenna or the like.  The word \"structure\" shall be construed, where the context allows, as though followed by the words \"or part or parts thereof\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anyone who wishes to construct, reconstruct or alter an exterior architectural feature must apply to the Commission for a certificate of appropriateness.  \"In passing upon appropriateness,\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the exterior architectural feature involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1955 Mass.Acts c. 616, Sec. 7.  The Commission must \"spread upon its records the reasons for [its] determination\" that a certificate of appropriateness should not issue.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  A party </span>aggrieved by the Commission's decision can appeal to the Superior Court for Suffolk County, which \"shall annul the determination of the commission\" if it is \"unwarranted by the evidence\" or \"insufficient in law.\"   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at Sec. </span>10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, given the stream of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the Commission developed uniform policies toward certain recurring types of proposed alterations.  In 1981, it formally adopted the policies as \"guidelines.\"   The guidelines regulate exterior architectural features such as masonry, roofs, windows, sash and shutters, doors, trim, paint, and ironwork.  One of the guidelines states that \"[f]reestanding signs are not permitted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs distribute their newspapers in the District via home delivery, store sales, street vendors, and \"newsracks.\"   Newsracks are newspaper distribution boxes painted in various colors and featuring the name of the newspaper and other advertising logos.  They are commonly anchored to lampposts, signposts, or fixtures on the sidewalk.  The plaintiffs maintain a total of thirty-nine newsracks in the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Newsracks were first introduced to the District in the early 1980s.  By 1983, Beacon Hill residents had begun to complain of the \"unsightliness, congestion and inconvenience associated with the vending machines.\"   Although the Commission believed that the newsracks violated the guideline prohibiting free-standing signs, it took no enforcement action because a city-wide regulation of newsracks was being discussed in the early 1980s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, no regulation having been adopted, the Beacon Hill Civic Association petitioned the Commission for a guideline to exclude newsracks from the District.  On February 21, 1991, the Commission adopted the following guideline:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Publication distribution boxes (any boxes placed on the sidewalks to distribute publications, whether for charge or not) visible from a public way are not allowed within the District.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 1, 1991, the Commission notified the plaintiffs of the new guideline.  One month later, it requested that the plaintiffs remove their newsracks by June 1, 1991.  The plaintiffs have not applied for any certificates of appropriateness.  The parties agree however that, given the blanket ban imposed by the guideline, filing an application for such a certificate with the Commission would have been a futile exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed this action in district court on August 28, 1991, seeking declaratory relief, damages, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief from the publication distribution guideline, which allegedly violated their First Amendment right to distribute newspapers on Beacon Hill.  Following a bench trial on stipulated facts, the court ruled from the bench that the publication distribution guideline offended the First Amendment.  The guideline, \"instead of being narrowly tailored with respect to the limitation on speech[,] is narrowly tailored to focus only on speech.  It applies to no form of visual clutter other than public[ation] distribution boxes....\"  Significantly, the trial judge was \"troubled whether there is statutory authority for the particular kind of legislative rule making\" illustrated by the guideline.  He did not decide the case on state law grounds, however, because \"the questions about the Architectural Commission's authority are at least debatable on the present record ... and perhaps would require some supplementation of the record in order for the Court to resolve them....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before judgment had entered, the Commission adopted a new guideline that bans all \"street furniture\"--not just publication distribution boxes--from the District:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Street furniture, as defined below, shall not be permitted in the Historic Beacon Hill District with the exception of approved store-front merchandise stands and those structures erected or placed by authorized public agencies for public safety and/or public welfare purposes.  Street furniture is defined as any structure erected or placed in the public or private ways on a temporary or permanent basis.  Authorized public safety/public welfare street furniture includes, but is not limited to, such structures as street lights, traffic lights, mail boxes, fire hydrants, street trees, and trash receptacles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Any such authorized public safety/public welfare street furniture or approved store-front merchandise stands shall be subject to Commission review and shall be in keeping with the architectural and historic character of the District and the criteria for exterior architectural features as specified in Chapter 616 of the Acts of 1955 as amended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission moved for reconsideration of the judgment, arguing that the new guideline is free from the constitutional defects of the old.  The district judge found that the new guideline fared no better under the First Amendment.  See Globe Newspaper v. Beacon Hill Architectural Comm'n, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span> </span>(D.Mass.1994).  This time, however, he held that the Commission lacked authority under Massachusetts law to adopt the street furniture guideline.  We examine the state law portion of the opinion in detail, and ultimately certify the issue of the Commission's rulemaking authority to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE COMMISSION'S RULEMAKING AUTHORITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Are newsracks \"structures\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the beginning of this litigation, the plaintiffs have insisted that only buildings are \"structures\" with \"exterior architectural features,\" and that newsracks are not \"structures\" within the Commission's jurisdiction.  They now also claim that the Commission lacks authority to regulate anything on the sidewalks or streets of Beacon Hill.  This new argument merely restates the threshold issue--are newsracks \"structures\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court so assumed without deciding.  Although the plaintiffs' reading of \"structure\" presented \"a close and rather curious question,\" Judge Keeton noted that the examples of \"structure\" given in the uniform state building code include tents, platforms, bins, and even flagpoles--none of which would be \"structures\" in the sense urged by the plaintiffs.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 183.</span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To complicate matters, the guidelines themselves seem to ratify the plaintiffs' interpretation.  The introduction to the guidelines states in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>[T]he statute authorizes the Beacon Hill Architectural Commission to review proposed changes to the exterior architectural features of buildings within the historic district.... Owners contemplating changes to the exterior of any building within the ... District should be aware that no alteration will be approved that is inappropriate to the historical character, architectural design, and materials of the building or its setting [emphasis added].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, like the district court, find the interpretation of \"structure\" to be a close question.  It is unnecessary to resolve this threshold issue, however, because we have decided to certify to the SJC the ultimate question of the Commission's authority to adopt the street furniture guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Substantive rulemaking authority</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the distinction between substantive and procedural rulemaking is not entirely clear, it seems clear enough in the context of this case.  The district court defined substantive rulemaking authority as the power to \"adopt rules that state substantive criteria for determining whether individual applications will be granted.\"  Globe <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Newspaper,</span> <span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">183</span></span>.   The street furniture guideline is a substantive rule.  It makes plain that nothing can be done to make private \"street furniture\" appropriate to the District.  In other words, applications for certificates of appropriateness will be denied whenever the structure involved is a piece of private street furniture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does the Commission have the power to adopt substantive rules?   The 1965 amendment to Sec. 4 of the Act provides in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>The commission may adopt, amend and repeal rules for the regulation of its affairs and the conduct of its business[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1965 Mass.Acts c. 429, Sec. 2.  The district court interpreted this amendment as authority for procedural rulemaking only.  The Commission argues that this reading reduces the amendment to surplusage;  it reasons as follows.  During its first ten years (1955-65), the Commission could not have carried out its statutory mandate if it lacked the implied power to make procedural rules for the conduct of its hearings, the filing and processing of applications, and the assignment of its staff.  Therefore, the 1965 amendment necessarily added something new:  the power to adopt substantive rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken at face value, this argument suggests that any time a governmental entity is expressly authorized to adopt rules, and the language of the authorization is not expressly limited to procedural rulemaking, the entity has been granted substantive rulemaking power.  We doubt that the truth is quite so simple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law at the time of the 1965 amendment does not dispel our doubt.  The district court cited several cases for the proposition that the phrase \"conduct of its business\" was commonly used to refer to matters of procedure and internal management.  See Insurance Co. of North Am. v. Commissioner of Ins., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2202546\"><a href=\"/opinion/2202546/insurance-co-of-north-america-v-commissioner-of-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2202546\"><a href=\"/opinion/2202546/insurance-co-of-north-america-v-commissioner-of-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 338 (1951) (commissioner of insurance shall grant license to an entity that has adopted \"by-laws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business\");  Burt v. Municipal Council of Taunton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span> </span>(1931) (municipal order creating a bidding process for city contracts is a rule for \"the conduct of the general business affairs of the city\");  Tapper v. Boston Chamber of Commerce, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span> </span>(1924) (directors may fix a reasonable charge for use of Chamber facilities, based on their authority to adopt rules \"for the government and proper business conduct of the Chamber\").  None of the cases, however, addresses the dichotomy between substantive and procedural rulemaking, or explicitly states that the defendant could adopt only procedural rules.  It is one thing to say that the phrase \"conduct of its business\" has been held to authorize a given procedural rule;  it is quite another to say that the phrase authorizes procedural rules alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final case cited by the district court, Farnham v. Lenox Motor Car Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span> </span>(1918), held that the superior court's rules \"regulating practice and procedure, expediting the trial of causes and the general conduct of its business\" do not overcome the parties' constitutional right to have controverted facts decided by a jury.  No court rule, substantive or procedural, could have changed the outcome in Farnham. Lacking controlling authority in the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, we find it fairly debatable whether the Act expressly confers substantive rulemaking power on the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission draws an analogy between its own rulemaking authority and that conferred by Mass.Gen.L. c. 40C, the general law authorizing cities and towns to establish historic districts.  Section 10(e) of c. 40C provides in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>The Commission ... may adopt and amend such rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this act and prescribe such forms as it shall deem desirable and necessary for the regulation of its affairs and the conduct of its business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The comparison seems strained.  First, the Commission cites no authority for its claim that the language of Sec. 10(e) \"is very clearly substantive rulemaking authority.\"   Second, the phrase \"not inconsistent with the provisions of this act\" does not appear in the Beacon Hill Act.  As the Commission acknowledges, the rulemaking language in c. 40C is \"similar but not identical to that in the Commission's statute.\"   We find nothing conclusive in the comparison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Is the guideline consistent with the Act?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the Act expressly or implicitly authorizes substantive rulemaking,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a reviewing court has to determine whether the street furniture guideline is consistent with the Act.  No agency can adopt a substantive rule that clashes with substantive requirements found in its own enabling statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 7 of the Act, which we quoted earlier, sets forth a list of factors that the Commission \"shall consider,\" in addition to \"any other pertinent factors,\" in passing upon an application for a certificate of appropriateness (emphasis added):  e.g., \"the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the exterior architectural feature involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district judge's view, the street furniture guideline flouts the mandate of 1955 Mass.Acts Sec. 7 because it bans all newsracks without regard to the setting or the exterior architectural features of any particular newsrack.  Most of the other guidelines deal with the mutable characteristics of structures;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  the street furniture guideline bans the structures themselves.  In effect, the Commission will no longer consider the exterior architectural features of street furniture on a case-by-case basis.  Yet the guidelines are prefaced by this comment:  \"Each application is considered on its individual merits, but the Beacon Hill Architectural Commission will act in accordance with the following guidelines[.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission replies that it has a mandate to make aesthetic judgments to \"preserv[e]\" and \"maintain\" the historic Beacon Hill District in accordance with the purpose of the Act.  Sec.  2.  Aesthetic judgments involve, to some extent, the exercise of sound discretion.  Although the Commission's idea of good taste is not all that matters under the Act, the legislature has arguably vested the Commission with broad discretion to decide the appropriateness of whole classes of exterior architectural features, and even whole classes of structures, if necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CERTIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We previously denied the Commission's motion to certify the question of its authority to adopt the street furniture guideline to the SJC.  The denial, which was provisional, was based in part on the Commission's failure to request certification below.  For the reasons that follow, we now certify the question on our own motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the state law issues in this case may be determinative.  We have found no controlling authority in the SJC's decisions, and \"the course [the] state court[ ] would take\" is not \"reasonably clear.\"  Nieves v. University of Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194980\"><a href=\"/opinion/194980/marta-v-u-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 275 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Porter v. Nutter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547470\"><a href=\"/opinion/547470/john-s-porter-v-harold-nutter/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 41 n. 4 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, significant concerns of federal-state comity have been raised here.  Soon after the publication distribution guideline was adopted, the Commission requested that all newsracks be removed from Beacon Hill.  The plaintiffs brought this action without having filed applications for certificates of appropriateness.  Although there is no doubt that the applications would have been denied, the Massachusetts courts were deprived of an opportunity to review the decisions of the Commission for factual and legal sufficiency.  Where, as here, the parties have bypassed a state procedure that would have permitted a state court to decide an issue of state law on which there is no controlling authority, certification of the issue serves our \"concern to promote federal-state comity....\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fischer,</span> <span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">7</span> </span>n. 2 (quoting White v. Edgar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1906362\"><a href=\"/opinion/1906362/white-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 675 (Me.1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the delays of certification will not prejudice the parties.  The Commission itself, albeit belatedly, moved for certification.  The plaintiffs' newsracks will not be disturbed unless there is a final judgment by this court reversing the judgment below.

Beacon Hill Architectural Commission, No. 94-1538, a question of Massachusetts law on which we are unable to find clear, controlling precedent in the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts may be determinative in this case.  Accordingly, we certify the following question to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts pursuant to its Rule 1:03--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>Did the Beacon Hill Architectural Commission have authority under 1955 Mass.Acts c. 616 (as amended) to adopt the \"Street Furniture Guideline\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated and discussed the facts relevant to the question certified in Globe Newspaper Co.

The Commission's argument of implied authority would normally be deemed waived on appeal.  See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Commission asserts that there is no historical precedent for the newsracks.  \"[T]he visual clutter created by their presence on the sidewalks ... clearly detracts from the historic and architectural character of the district.\"   Moreover, the newsracks have \"accumulated ... to the point that pedestrian access is being significantly restricted.\"   Based on its experience and expertise, and its mandate to promote the \"educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the public through the preservation of the historic Beacon Hill district,\" 1955 Mass.Acts Sec. 2, the Commission made a reasonable judgment that newsracks and other types of street furniture are not appropriate to the district</p>\n        <p>The plaintiffs counter that the streets and sidewalks of Beacon Hill, in 1955 as well as today, bear no resemblance to their Nineteenth Century precursors.  The public way is already crowded with innovations such as automobiles, paved roads, traffic lights, parking meters, and parking signs;  \"there was and is little or no history to preserve on the streets and sidewalks of Beacon Hill.\"   The aesthetics of the streets and sidewalks were \"a lost cause\" even before the first newsracks arrived.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
