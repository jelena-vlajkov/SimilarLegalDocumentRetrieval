Defendant Ellerton P. Whitney  appears\r                                \n\nin this court for the fifth time in connection with  his 1991\n\nbank fraud conviction.   He here appeals from the denial of a\n\nrequest  for post-conviction  relief--a request  styled as  a\n\nmotion for  new trial under  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 33 or,  in the\n\nalternative, as a petition for relief under 28 U.S.C.   2255.\n\nFor  the following reasons, as  well as those  recited by the\n\ndistrict court, we affirm. \n\n     The instant request  for relief was  prompted by  events\n\noccurring   during   Whitney's   earlier   appeal   from  his\n\nresentencing.  Whitney  notes that the  government there,  in\n\naddressing the amount of loss for purposes of calculating the\n\noffense level, argued that the district court could  consider\n\nlosses  attributable to \"uncharged  loans\" under the relevant\n\nconduct provision of the sentencing guidelines.  See U.S.S.G.\r                                                                \n\n  1B1.3.   He also notes  that we endorsed such  a measure in\n\nour decision.   See United  States v. Whitney,  21 F.3d  420,\r                                                         \n\nslip  op.   at  5  (1st  Cir.  1994)   (per  curiam)  (table)\n\n(\"Especially considering that additional losses resulted from\n\nuncharged  conduct  that  was  part  of  a  common scheme  or\n\nplan,...   we   find  no   error   in   the  court's   [loss]\n\ndetermination.\").  In the belief that neither the presentence\n\nreport (PSR) nor the district court had made any reference to\n\nuncharged   relevant   conduct,  Whitney   infers   that  the\n\ngovernment's (and  this court's)  reference pertained  to the\n\nsubsequent CRB and FCB loans.  From this premise, he proceeds\n\nto  conclude,  inter alia,  that:  (1) this  court  \"by clear\r                                     \r\r\n\nimplication\" found him not  liable for \"61.4% of  the conduct\n\nfor which he was  specifically accused, tried, convicted, and\n\ntwice sentenced,\" Brief at 9-10;  (2) his conviction was thus\n\nimproperly based on charges  not appearing in the indictment;\n\nand  (3) the  government's eleventh-hour  admission  of these\n\nfacts  constitutes  misconduct  warranting dismissal  of  the\n\nindictment,  or  at least  \"new  evidence\"  warranting a  new\n\ntrial.\n\n     Whitney's premise is wrong.  The PSR did, in fact, refer\n\nto uncharged relevant  conduct (apart  from the  CRB and  FCB\n\nloans).  See PSR   40  (\"Nor does the figure above [referring\r                        \n\nto  the  losses  specified  in  the  indictment]  reflect  an\n\napproximately $100,000 loss to the Dartmouth Bank as part  of\n\nthe same  scheme presented  earlier in  this report.\").   The\n\ndistrict court specifically  incorporated this amount in  its\n\nloss  calculations.     See  4/27/93  Order   at  3;  4/26/93\r                                       \n\nTranscript at 86.  And  the reference to \"uncharged  conduct\"\n\nin  our earlier opinion was made with the Dartmouth Bank loss\n\nin mind.\n\n     In any  event, Whitney's  complaint here is  little more\n\nthan  a  rehash of  his  \"variance\"  argument that  has  been\n\nrejected by this court on two previous occasions.  See United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v.
