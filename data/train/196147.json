Two former employees of American\r                                      \r\n\nHonda Motor  Company,  defendants John  Billmyer  and  Dennis\r\n\nJosleyn, have  been on  trial in  the district  court charged\r\n\nwith RICO, conspiracy and  mail fraud violations arising from\r\n\nan alleged commercial bribery scheme involving Honda dealers.\r\n\nThe defendants were indicted by a federal grand jury on March\r\n\n11,  1994, and  trial began  in February  1995.   About three\r\n\nweeks into the trial, Josleyn  served a subpoena duces  tecum\r\n\non American Honda, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c).  It is\r\n\nthis  demand that gave rise to the present proceeding in this\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n     The  Josleyn  subpoena   demanded  that  American  Honda\r\n\nproduce inter alia  a file maintained  by Sherry Cameron,  an\r                              \r\n\nAmerican  Honda  vice  president, that  consists  largely  of\r\n\ninformation  received  from  the company's  outside  counsel,\r\n\nnotes  taken by  her  during conversations  with counsel  and\r\n\nmemoranda reflecting such information.  American Honda  moved\r\n\nto quash the subpoena  on attorney-client privilege and work-\r\n\nproduct  grounds.  Its former  law firm, Lyon  &amp; Lyon, joined\r\n\nthe  motion, asserting that certain of the documents were its\r\n\nwork product and protected under the work-product doctrine.\r\n\n     The  district  court found  that  Josleyn  had made  the\r\n\nthreshold  showing required under  United States  v. LaRouche\r                                                                         \r\n\nCampaign, 841 F.2d 1176 (1st Cir. 1988), to warrant in camera\r                                                                         \r\n\nreview  of the  documents in  the Cameron  file.   After some\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nwrangling, American Honda submitted  the file to the district\r\n\ncourt,  but appealed the court's LaRouche ruling.  This Court\r                                                     \r\n\ndismissed  that appeal on April  4, 1995, on  the ground that\r\n\nthe district court's order  was not final.  United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBillmyer, No. 95-1324, 95-1325, slip op. at 1 (1st Cir., Apr.\r                    \r\n\n19,  1995).   We  recognized that  American Honda  might have\r\n\ndifficulty  appealing any  subsequent  orders  rejecting  its\r\n\nprivilege claims  because it would no  longer have possession\r\n\nof the files and  could not automatically provoke a  contempt\r\n\nproceeding.  Id.\r                            \r\n\n     The district judge then conducted an in camera review of\r                                                               \r\n\nthe Cameron  file and issued  a 40-page order  appraising the\r\n\ndocuments page by page.   Although he found much of  the file\r\n\nto  be protected  either by  attorney-client privilege  or as\r\n\nwork product, the judge found that some of the documents were\r\n\nunprotected,  either  because  neither  doctrine  applied  or\r\n\nbecause the privilege had been  waived.  American Honda  then\r\n\nmoved  for the  return of  the sealed  documents, so  that it\r\n\ncould  test  the rulings  in a  contempt proceeding,  but the\r\n\ndistrict court denied the motion and made ready to reveal the\r\n\ndisputed materials to the defendants.\r\n\n     American  Honda and  Lyon  &amp; Lyon  then filed  immediate\r\n\nappeals,  challenging   the   proposed  disclosure   of   the\r\n\ndocuments; in the alternative,  writs of mandamus were sought\r\n\nif the appeal were dismissed.  American Honda objected to all\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nof  the disclosures while Lyon &amp; Lyon restricted its claim to\r\n\none  document.  At  appellants' request, this  court on April\r\n\n19, 1995, stayed the district court's order pending expedited\r\n\nreview.    The district  court  then  suspended the  criminal\r\n\ntrial,  awaiting a ruling by  this court.   Briefs were filed\r\n\nhere on April 28, 1995, and oral argument was heard on May 1,\r\n\n1995.\r\n\n     On May 4, 1995, this court decided the case and released\r\n\na  brief  order  in advance  of  this  opinion,  so that  the\r\n\nrecessed criminal  trial could  be resumed immediately.   Our\r\n\norder  stated  that  the  district  court's  order  directing\r\n\ndisclosure  of the  disputed  materials did  not qualify  for\r\n\nreview either under the  collateral order doctrine or through\r\n\nmandamus.   We directed  entry of  judgment, issuance  of the\r\n\nmandate  forthwith, and  dissolution  of the  April 19  stay.\r\n\nThis opinion is to  explain the reasons for our  dismissal of\r\n\nthe appeals and denial of mandamus.\r\n\n     The first  question is whether American Honda and Lyon &amp;\r\n\nLyon may appeal from the discovery  order.  Surprisingly, the\r\n\nlaw in this area is more tangled than one would expect, given\r\n\nthe  recurring nature of the problem.  From the standpoint of\r\n\nthe proceeding itself--a  criminal trial--there is no  \"final\r\n\ndecision\"  until  the trial  ends.    Corporacion Insular  de\r                                                                         \r\n\nSeguros  v.  Garcia,  876  F.2d  254,  256  (1st  Cir.  1989)\r                               \r\n\n(\"Garcia\").  But the  collateral order doctrine recognized in\r                    \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nCohen v. Beneficial Indus.  Loan Corp., 337 U.S.  541, 545-47\r                                                  \r\n\n(1949), provides one means for examining issues that arise in\r\n\nthe course of a continuing proceeding; failing that, mandamus\r\n\nremains a  possibility.   Appellants invoke both  concepts in\r\n\nthis court.\r\n\n     At the threshold Josleyn  urges dismissal because a non-\r\n\nparty normally  cannot appeal  an order enforcing  a subpoena\r\n\nbut must provoke a contempt order as the basis for an appeal.\r\n\nUnited States v. Ryan, 402 U.S.  530 (1971).  That path is no\r                                 \r\n\nlonger  open  to  American  Honda  and may  never  have  been\r\n\navailable to Lyon  &amp; Lyon.   Given the  judicial interest  in\r\n\nallowing  a  trial court  to  inspect  disputed documents  in\r                                                                         \r\n\ncamera,  we  decline  to  hold  that  a  holder  of documents\r                  \r\n\nforfeits appeal  rights otherwise available by  allowing such\r\n\nan inspection.\r\n\n     Conversely, we  do not  think that the  district court's\r\n\ndiscovery order becomes a \"final decision\" under  28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1291 simply  because contempt is  not available as  a vehicle\r\n\nfor review.  Perlman v. United States, 247 U.S. 7, 13 (1918),\r                                                 \r\n\nand Cobbledick v.

In\r\n\nthis circuit, to qualify for immediate appeal as a collateral\r\n\norder, an order must involve\r\n\n     (1) an issue essentially unrelated to the merits of\r\n     the  main  dispute,   capable  of  review   without\r\n     disrupting   the  main   trial;   (2)  a   complete\r\n     resolution   of  the   issue,  not   one  that   is\r\n     `unfinished'   or   `inconclusive';  (3)   a  right\r\n     incapable  of  vindication  on  appeal  from  final\r\n     judgment;  and  (4)  an  important   and  unsettled\r\n     question of controlling law, not  merely a question\r\n     of  the   proper  exercise  of  the  trial  court's\r\n     discretion.\r\n\nUnited States v. Sorren, 605 F.2d 1211, 1213 (1st Cir. 1979).\r                                   \r\n\nIn addition, the Supreme  Court has warned that interlocutory\r\n\nappeals \"are  especially inimical  to the effective  and fair\r\n\nadministration of the criminal law.\"  Abney v.

As  to the\r\n\nthird prong, any disclosure that occurs now will be virtually\r\n\nunreviewable  after  a final  judgment.   In  the case  of an\r\n\nacquittal,  no appeal  can  ensue,  and  in  the  case  of  a\r\n\nconviction,  any  appeal would  be  taken  by defendants  who\r\n\neither sought or acquiesced in the disclosure.\r\n\n     The  remaining, and most  daunting, question  is whether\r\n\nthis  case presents  a  distinct and  important legal  issue.\r\n\nAlthough not  all  circuits employ  such  a test,  it  enjoys\r\n\nconsiderable  support.

Ordinarily, a  discovery order\r\n\nwill  meet the legal-importance  test only  if it  presents a\r\n\nclaim  of clear-cut legal error and not merely a challenge to\r\n\nthe   district  judge's   factual   determinations   or   the\r\n\napplication of a settled legal rule to the particular facts.\r\n\n     The  requirement of  an important  legal issue  rests in\r                                                         \r\n\npart on the increased  likelihood that such an appeal  may be\r\n\nfruitful;  legal rulings  are  reviewed de  novo, while  more\r                                                            \r\n\ndeferential standards of review  apply to factual findings or\r\n\napplication of known legal  rules to specific facts.   See In\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nre Extradition of  Howard, 996 F.2d  1320, 1327-28 (1st  Cir.\r                                     \r\n\n1992).   It is  not easy  to justify the  interruption of  an\r\n\nongoing  proceeding,  especially   a  criminal  trial,  where\r\n\naffirmance is  very likely because the issues  are ones where\r\n\nthe  district court is reviewed only for clear error or abuse\r\n\nof discretion.\r\n\n     In addition,  where the appeal occurs  during a criminal\r\n\ntrial,  a  mistrial  may  result  if  the appeal  process  is\r\n\nprolonged, raising  both  speedy trial  and  double  jeopardy\r\n\nconcerns.   United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 768 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1994).  Were  every factual dispute or law  application issue\r\n\nposed by  a privilege claim  open to interlocutory  review in\r\n\nmid-trial,  it  could  take  weeks to  secure  the  necessary\r\n\ntranscripts, learn background facts  that the trial judge has\r\n\nabsorbed  over many  months,  and then  replicate and  review\r\n\ndistrict court rulings.\r\n\n     Admittedly,  this collateral  order  test does  create a\r\n\npossibility that disclosure of documents may be ordered based\r\n\non a mistake of  fact or a misapplication of settled law, and\r\n\nthe error may escape review.  But litigation  is full of such\r\n\ninstances:     a  temporary   restraining  order   may  cause\r\n\nirreparable  harm;  burdensome  discovery  may  be  compelled\r\n\nbefore  review  can be  secured;  a  witness whose  claim  of\r\n\nprivilege is overruled may  answer rather than risk contempt.\r\n\nThe finality  rule  reflects  a  compromise  among  competing\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\ninterests.   Given the protection afforded  by the collateral\r\n\norder  doctrine and mandamus,  we think that  there is little\r\n\nchance of any grave miscarriage of justice.\r\n\n     No  one  can make  a  seamless web  out  of  all of  the\r\n\ndecisions  on  collateral  orders.    The  circuits  are  not\r\n\nunanimous in every nuance, see 15A Wright, supra,   3911, and\r                                                            \r\n\neven  within  circuits,  a  wider  scope  of  review  may  be\r\n\navailable  for some   interlocutory orders, such  as an order\r\n\ndenying a claim of immunity or an order imposing sanctions on\r\n\na non-party for  contempt.  E.g.,  Lowinger v. Broderick,  50\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 61,  64 (1st  Cir. 1995)  (immunity).   But we  have set\r\n\nforth the  collateral order  doctrine in  this circuit  as it\r\n\napplies  to  discovery  orders,  and  must  respect  our  own\r\n\nprecedents. \r\n\n     Turning to the merits, we conclude that the  claims made\r\n\nin these attempted appeals  do not reveal any clear  error of\r\n\nlaw.   The district judge  at the outset  accurately laid out\r\n\nthe rules  applicable to  the  attorney-client privilege  and\r\n\nwork-product protection, including  the pertinent  exceptions\r\n\nand  waiver.   He reviewed  the  documents virtually  line by\r\n\nline, finding  some pages  or portions  to be  protected from\r\n\ndisclosure  and  some unprotected.    Most  of the  arguments\r\n\nraised on appeal are patently  attacks on factual findings or\r\n\non the application  of legal  standards to those  facts.   To\r\n\nreview each ruling would  require a time-consuming effort and\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nentail  a delay all out of  proportion to any likelihood of a\r\n\nreversal. \r\n\n     But American Honda does raise one issue that involves an\r\n\narguable claim  of legal  error.   In  examining the  Cameron\r\n\n\"legal  file,\"  the  district  judge concluded  that,  as  to\r\n\ncertain  portions of  the  materials  protected by  attorney-\r\n\nclient privilege,  American Honda  had waived  the privilege.\r\n\nAmerican Honda says that the district judge misunderstood the\r\n\nlegal  standard  for  an  implied waiver  of  the  privilege.\r\n\nSpecifically, the district court found that \r\n\n     American Honda has  disclosed to the  United States\r\n     government considerable portions of the information\r\n     acquired  through  internal investigation  into the\r\n     conduct   comprising   the   charges  against   the\r\n     defendants  in  this  case. .  .  .    In light  of\r\n     American Honda's disclosure of information acquired\r\n     through  internal  investigation,  the court  finds\r\n     that  American Honda has waived the attorney-client\r\n     privilege  with  respect  to  documents  containing\r\n     information      acquired     through      internal\r\n     investigation.\r\n\n     The court then listed the  portions of the materials  as\r\n\nto which American Honda  had waived the privilege.   American\r\n\nHonda now contends that  waiver results only when  the client\r\n\nreveals privileged communications to  a third party, not when\r\n\nthe client reveals \"the  information\" contained in privileged\r\n\ncommunications.    American Honda  argues  that  the district\r\n\ncourt clearly  erred by finding  a waiver from  the company's\r\n\ndisclosure  to the  government  of facts,  not of  privileged\r                                                    \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\ncommunications.  E.g., Upjohn Co. v.  United States, 449 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n383, 395 (1980).\r\n\n     The  district  judge  may  have  meant  that  privileged\r\n\ncommunications were disclosed to the government and therefore\r                          \r\n\nprivilege as to  those topics was waived.  On the other hand,\r\n\nthe judge  twice referred  to American Honda's  disclosure of\r\n\n\"information,\"  and  did  not   indicate  that  any  specific\r\n\nprivileged  documents had been  disclosed.  So  the judge may\r\n\nhave found waiver because the substance of the communications\r\n\nhad  already  been revealed  to  the  government by  American\r\n\nHonda.  If the court's ruling embraced this latter theory, we\r\n\nagree that  a legal issue  is raised, but  do not  agree that\r\n\nsuch a theory constitutes legal error.2\r\n\n     To put the matter in context, we note that the documents\r\n\nas to  which waiver was found appear  to be pages or portions\r\n\nof pages setting forth information gathered by Lyon &amp; Lyon at\r\n\nthe behest of American Honda  from sources whose identity  is\r\n\nnot  revealed.    The  information  consists  importantly  of\r\n\nallegations or evidence as to payments  made by Honda dealers\r\n\nto  Honda employees.  The documents, prepared by Lyon &amp; Lyon,\r\n\nCameron  or  others,  reflect   the  communication  of  these\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2In noting the ambiguity,  we intend no criticism.   The\r\ndistrict  judge's   careful  analysis,  detailed   order  and\r\ndocument-by-document  review--undertaken in  the middle  of a\r\ncomplex trial--were altogether admirable.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nallegations  or evidence  to Cameron  or other  executives of\r\n\nAmerican Honda.\r\n\n     It  is  fair to  read the  district  court's order  as a\r\n\nfinding that the same allegations or evidence were thereafter\r\n\ndisclosed by American Honda to government investigators.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court  does  not   describe  means  of  disclosure;\r\n\nappellants' briefs shed no light upon the matter, but also do\r\n\nnot  contest the finding that such a disclosure occurred.  We\r\n\nthus  take the case as  one in which  American Honda received\r\n\nfactual information  from its counsel,  disclosed those facts\r\n\nto  the government, and  now seeks to  withhold the documents\r\n\nthat reflect the original  communication of that  information\r\n\nto American Honda.\r\n\n     One might  ask why  there is  any basis  for a  claim of\r\n\nprivilege  in  the first  instance,  since  the privilege  is\r\n\nprimarily designed to protect communications by the client to\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe lawyer in  order to procure  legal advise.   See VIII  J.\r                                                                \r\n\nWigmore,  Evidence    2320,  at  628-29  (J. McNaughton,  ed.\r                              \r\n\n1961).   Possibly some of the information was provided to the\r\n\nlaw  firm by American Honda employees.  Or the district court\r\n\nmay have  deemed the material privileged  (aside from waiver)\r\n\nbecause  the  lawyer's  communications  to   the  client  are\r\n\nsecondarily protected as needed to prevent inferring what the\r\n\nclient said to the lawyer.

Wigmore tells us that \"[j]udicial decision gives\r\n\nno  clear answer  to th[e] question\"  of what  constitutes \"a\r\n\nwaiver by implication,\" and that only a few general instances\r\n\nare  well  settled.

Admitting that  \"authority is scanty,\"\r               \r\n\nMcCormick cites a number of cases in which disclosures by the\r\n\nclient, other than  those involving in-court testimony,  have\r\n\nbeen  held to be a waiver.   I McCormick on Evidence   93, at\r                                                                \r\n\n377-48 (J. Strong ed., 4th ed. 1992).\r\n\n     Appellants   respond   that   the   privilege   protects\r\n\n\"communications, not facts,\" Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 395, so that\r                                               \r\n\nAmerican Honda  cannot have  waived the privilege  as to  the\r\n\nnotes or memoranda merely by  revealing to the government the\r\n\nallegations or  evidence recorded in the  notes or memoranda.\r\n\nThe distinction is useful in some circumstances--say, where a\r\n\nparty tries to refuse to testify about an automobile accident\r\n\non  the ground that he gave his counsel a private description\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nof  the  same accident.    But, once  again,  the distinction\r\n\nappears to have little to do with the present problem.\r\n\n     Here, the  gist of the  matter is that  counsel informed\r\n\nthe  client of  detailed evidence and  allegations concerning\r\n\npossible bribes  of its  employees, and  the client  chose to\r\n\nmake this same information available to the government.  What\r\n\nis sought by the defense in the criminal trial is merely  the\r\n\nrecordations by or for the  client of this same  information.\r\n\nThe information  now having been  disclosed by the  client to\r\n\nthe government, it  is unclear what  damage to the  attorney-\r\n\nclient  privilege  can occur  from  making the  corresponding\r\n\nportions of the file available.  the district court carefully\r\n\nlimited the disclosures to the factual allegations, excluding\r\n\nany commentary on their legal implications.\r\n\n     Indeed, American Honda's disclosure to the government of\r\n\nthe  factual information received from  its law firm not only\r\n\nreveals that  information, and American  Honda's knowledge of\r\n\nit, but makes an  inquiry into the  source and basis for  the\r\n\ninformation hard to avoid.   A risk of unfairness  is evident\r\n\nwhere  information is provided to  one side in  a case (here,\r\n\nthe United States)  and then  an inquiry into  its origin  is\r\n\nshielded by a claim of privilege.   In a variety of contexts,\r\n\nthe affirmative  use of privileged information  has been held\r\n\nto  be a waiver of  privilege.  See  P. Rice, Attorney-Client\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nPrivilege in the United States   9.34, at 711,    938, 9.40  \r                                          \r\n\n950, at 752-53 (1993) (collecting cases).\r\n\n     Given the disclosure to the government, the waiver label\r\n\nis presumptively apt.   Waiver doctrine has only a  few hard-\r\n\nedged rules; as to many permutations,  it is a fluid body  of\r\n\nprecedent  reflecting a  variety  of  concerns, including  an\r\n\ninsistence on  real confidentiality and limitations  based on\r\n\nfairness.     See   \"Developments  in   the   Law--Privileged\r                             \r\n\nCommunications,\" 98 Harv. L.  Rev. 1450, 1629-32 (1985).   In\r                                              \r\n\nthis instance, confidentiality has largely been dissolved  by\r\n\nAmerican Honda's own actions.\r\n\n     One argument not made by appellants is that, as a matter\r                                 \r\n\nof policy, private revelations  to the government of possible\r\n\ncriminal conduct  ought not waive  the privilege as  to third\r\n\nparties.   The  concern,  of  course, is  to  encourage  such\r\n\nrevelations.  The  general tendency  of the law  is to  treat\r\n\nwaivers  as an  all-or-nothing  proposition, e.g.,  ALI Model\r                                                                         \r\n\nCode  of Evidence, Rule 231, comment (a) (1942); but there is\r                             \r\n\na  trace  of  support  for  limited  waivers  in  some  cases\r\n\ninvolving   confidential   disclosures  to   the  government.\r\n\nDiversified Industries,  Inc. v. Meredith, 572  F.2d 606 (8th\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1977).  See generally Rice, supra, 9.86-9.87 (collecting\r                                                  \r\n\nand analyzing the cases).\r\n\n     On  the other hand, it  is a serious  matter to withhold\r\n\nfrom a defendant in a criminal case details that have already\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nbeen made available  to the government  by a person  claiming\r\n\nthe  privilege.  If there  were ever an  argument for limited\r\n\nwaiver, it  might well  depend importantly  on just  what had\r\n\nbeen disclosed to the  government and on what understandings.\r\n\nWithout intending  to preclude such  an argument in  a future\r\n\ncase, we think that it  is enough in this one to  say that no\r\n\nsuch claim of limited waiver has been argued to us.\r\n\n     This discussion also disposes of the alternative request\r\n\nfor mandamus.   Mandamus is a discretionary writ available in\r\n\nextraordinary  circumstances  to   redress  grievous   error.\r\n\nGarcia,  876 F.2d  at 260.   While  it is  not restricted  to\r                  \r\n\nerrors of law, it does require that the error be manifest and\r\n\nthe burden of  showing manifest error  is upon the  applicant\r\n\nfor the writ.  No such legal error has been  shown and, as to\r\n\nthe  district  court's   fact-findings  and  applications  of\r\n\nsettled rules to particular  facts, it is enough to  say that\r\n\nwe have found no manifest error.\r\n\n     Judgment has  been previously  entered.  We  direct that\r\n\nthis opinion be filed  and transmitted to the  district court\r\n\nand the  parties to the appeal.  Each side shall bear its own\r\n\ncosts.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r                                 \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n",

Two former employees of American\r                                      \r\n\nHonda Motor  Company,  defendants John  Billmyer  and  Dennis\r\n\nJosleyn, have  been on  trial in  the district  court charged\r\n\nwith RICO, conspiracy and  mail fraud violations arising from\r\n\nan alleged commercial bribery scheme involving Honda dealers.\r\n\nThe defendants were indicted by a federal grand jury on March\r\n\n11,  1994, and  trial began  in February  1995.   About three\r\n\nweeks into the trial, Josleyn  served a subpoena duces  tecum\r\n\non American Honda, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c).  It is\r\n\nthis  demand that gave rise to the present proceeding in this\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n     The  Josleyn  subpoena   demanded  that  American  Honda\r\n\nproduce inter alia  a file maintained  by Sherry Cameron,  an\r                              \r\n\nAmerican  Honda  vice  president, that  consists  largely  of\r\n\ninformation  received  from  the company's  outside  counsel,\r\n\nnotes  taken by  her  during conversations  with counsel  and\r\n\nmemoranda reflecting such information.  American Honda  moved\r\n\nto quash the subpoena  on attorney-client privilege and work-\r\n\nproduct  grounds.  Its former  law firm, Lyon  &amp; Lyon, joined\r\n\nthe  motion, asserting that certain of the documents were its\r\n\nwork product and protected under the work-product doctrine.\r\n\n     The  district  court found  that  Josleyn  had made  the\r\n\nthreshold  showing required under  United States  v. LaRouche\r                                                                         \r\n\nCampaign, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503067\"><a href=\"/opinion/503067/united-states-v-the-larouche-campaign-appeal-of-national-broadcasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1st Cir. 1988), to warrant in camera\r                                                                         \r\n\nreview  of the  documents in  the Cameron  file.

This Court\r                                                     \r\n\ndismissed  that appeal on April  4, 1995, on  the ground that\r\n\nthe district court's order  was not final.

We  recognized that  American Honda  might have\r\n\ndifficulty  appealing any  subsequent  orders  rejecting  its\r\n\nprivilege claims  because it would no  longer have possession\r\n\nof the files and  could not automatically provoke a  contempt\r\n\nproceeding.  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503067\"><a href=\"/opinion/503067/united-states-v-the-larouche-campaign-appeal-of-national-broadcasting/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r                            \r\n\n     The district </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">judge then conducted an in camera review of\r                                                               \r\n\nthe Cameron  file and issued  a 40-page order  appraising the\r\n\ndocuments page by page.   Although he found much of  the file\r\n\nto  be protected  either by  attorney-client privilege  or as\r\n\nwork product, the judge found that some of the documents were\r\n\nunprotected,  either  because  neither  doctrine  applied  or\r\n\nbecause the privilege had been  waived.  American Honda  then\r\n\nmoved  for the  return of  the sealed  documents, so  that it\r\n\ncould  test  the rulings  in a  contempt proceeding,  but the\r\n\ndistrict court denied the motion and made ready to reveal the\r\n\ndisputed materials to the defendants.\r\n\n     American  Honda and  Lyon  &amp; Lyon  then filed  immediate\r\n\nappeals,  challenging   the   proposed  disclosure   of   the\r\n\ndocuments; in the alternative,  writs of mandamus were sought\r\n\nif the appeal were dismissed.  American Honda objected to all\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nof  the disclosures while Lyon &amp; Lyon restricted its claim to\r\n\none  document.  At  appellants' request, this  court on April\r\n\n19, 1995, stayed the district court's order pending expedited\r\n\nreview.    The district  court  then  suspended the  criminal\r\n\ntrial,  awaiting a ruling by  this court.   Briefs were filed\r\n\nhere on April 28, 1995, and oral argument was heard on May 1,\r\n\n1995.\r\n\n     On May 4, 1995, this court decided the case and released\r\n\na  brief  order  in advance  of  this  opinion,  so that  the\r\n\nrecessed criminal  trial could  be resumed immediately.   Our\r\n\norder  stated  that  the  district  court's  order  directing\r\n\ndisclosure  of the  disputed  materials did  not qualify  for\r\n\nreview either under the  collateral order doctrine or through\r\n\nmandamus.   We directed  entry of  judgment, issuance  of the\r\n\nmandate  forthwith, and  dissolution  of the  April 19  stay.\r\n\nThis opinion is to  explain the reasons for our  dismissal of\r\n\nthe appeals and denial of mandamus.\r\n\n     The first  question is whether American Honda and Lyon &amp;\r\n\nLyon may appeal from the discovery  order.  Surprisingly, the\r\n\nlaw in this area is more tangled than one would expect, given\r\n\nthe  recurring nature of the problem.  From the standpoint of\r\n\nthe proceeding itself--a  criminal trial--there is no  \"final\r\n\ndecision\"  until  the trial  ends.

Appellants invoke both  concepts in\r\n\nthis court.\r\n\n     At the threshold Josleyn  urges dismissal because a non-\r\n\nparty normally  cannot appeal  an order enforcing  a subpoena\r\n\nbut must provoke a contempt order as the basis for an appeal.\r\n\nUnited States v.

Were  every factual dispute or law  application issue\r\n\nposed by  a privilege claim  open to interlocutory  review in\r\n\nmid-trial,  it  could  take  weeks to  secure  the  necessary\r\n\ntranscripts, learn background facts  that the trial judge has\r\n\nabsorbed  over many  months,  and then  replicate and  review\r\n\ndistrict court rulings.\r\n\n     Admittedly,  this collateral  order  test does  create a\r\n\npossibility that disclosure of documents may be ordered based\r\n\non a mistake of  fact or a misapplication of settled law, and\r\n\nthe error may escape review.  But litigation  is full of such\r\n\ninstances:     a  temporary   restraining  order   may  cause\r\n\nirreparable  harm;  burdensome  discovery  may  be  compelled\r\n\nbefore  review  can be  secured;  a  witness whose  claim  of\r\n\nprivilege is overruled may  answer rather than risk contempt.\r\n\nThe finality  rule  reflects  a  compromise  among  competing\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\ninterests.

But we  have set\r\n\nforth the  collateral order  doctrine in  this circuit  as it\r\n\napplies  to  discovery  orders,  and  must  respect  our  own\r\n\nprecedents. \r\n\n     Turning to the merits, we conclude that the  claims made\r\n\nin these attempted appeals  do not reveal any clear  error of\r\n\nlaw.   The district judge  at the outset  accurately laid out\r\n\nthe rules  applicable to  the  attorney-client privilege  and\r\n\nwork-product protection, including  the pertinent  exceptions\r\n\nand  waiver.   He reviewed  the  documents virtually  line by\r\n\nline, finding  some pages  or portions  to be  protected from\r\n\ndisclosure  and  some unprotected.    Most  of the  arguments\r\n\nraised on appeal are patently  attacks on factual findings or\r\n\non the application  of legal  standards to those  facts.   To\r\n\nreview each ruling would  require a time-consuming effort and\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nentail  a delay all out of  proportion to any likelihood of a\r\n\nreversal. \r\n\n     But American Honda does raise one issue that involves an\r\n\narguable claim  of legal  error.   In  examining the  Cameron\r\n\n\"legal  file,\"  the  district  judge concluded  that,  as  to\r\n\ncertain  portions of  the  materials  protected by  attorney-\r\n\nclient privilege,  American Honda  had waived  the privilege.\r\n\nAmerican Honda says that the district judge misunderstood the\r\n\nlegal  standard  for  an  implied waiver  of  the  privilege.\r\n\nSpecifically, the district court found that \r\n\n     American Honda has  disclosed to the  United States\r\n     government considerable portions of the information\r\n     acquired  through  internal investigation  into the\r\n     conduct   comprising   the   charges  against   the\r\n     defendants  in  this  case. .  .  .    In light  of\r\n     American Honda's disclosure of information acquired\r\n     through  internal  investigation,  the court  finds\r\n     that  American Honda has waived the attorney-client\r\n     privilege  with  respect  to  documents  containing\r\n     information      acquired     through      internal\r\n     investigation.\r\n\n     The court then listed the  portions of the materials  as\r\n\nto which American Honda  had waived the privilege.   American\r\n\nHonda now contends that  waiver results only when  the client\r\n\nreveals privileged communications to  a third party, not when\r\n\nthe client reveals \"the  information\" contained in privileged\r\n\ncommunications.    American Honda  argues  that  the district\r\n\ncourt clearly  erred by finding  a waiver from  the company's\r\n\ndisclosure  to the  government  of facts,  not of  privileged\r                                                    \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\ncommunications.  E.g., Upjohn Co. v.  United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r                                                               \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">383</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395 (1980).\r\n\n     The  district  judge  may  have  meant  that  privileged\r\n\ncommunications were disclosed to the government and therefore\r                          \r\n\nprivilege as to  those topics was waived.  On the other hand,\r\n\nthe judge  twice referred  to American Honda's  disclosure of\r\n\n\"information,\"  and  did  not   indicate  that  any  specific\r\n\nprivileged  documents had been  disclosed.  So  the judge may\r\n\nhave found waiver because the substance of the communications\r\n\nhad  already  been revealed  to  the  government by  American\r\n\nHonda.  If the court's ruling embraced this latter theory, we\r\n\nagree that  a legal issue  is raised, but  do not  agree that\r\n\nsuch a theory constitutes legal error.2\r\n\n     To put the matter in context, we note that the documents\r\n\nas to  which waiver was found appear  to be pages or portions\r\n\nof pages setting forth information gathered by Lyon &amp; Lyon at\r\n\nthe behest of American Honda  from sources whose identity  is\r\n\nnot  revealed.    The  information  consists  importantly  of\r\n\nallegations or evidence as to payments  made by Honda dealers\r\n\nto  Honda employees.  The documents, prepared by Lyon &amp; Lyon,\r\n\nCameron  or  others,  reflect   the  communication  of  these\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2In noting the ambiguity,  we intend no criticism.   The\r\ndistrict  judge's   careful  analysis,  detailed   order  and\r\ndocument-by-document  review--undertaken in  the middle  of a\r\ncomplex trial--were altogether admirable.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nallegations  or evidence  to Cameron  or other  executives of\r\n\nAmerican Honda.\r\n\n     It  is  fair to  read the  district  court's order  as a\r\n\nfinding that the same allegations or evidence were thereafter\r\n\ndisclosed by American Honda to government investigators.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court  does  not   describe  means  of  disclosure;\r\n\nappellants' briefs shed no light upon the matter, but also do\r\n\nnot  contest the finding that such a disclosure occurred.  We\r\n\nthus  take the case as  one in which  American Honda received\r\n\nfactual information  from its counsel,  disclosed those facts\r\n\nto  the government, and  now seeks to  withhold the documents\r\n\nthat reflect the original  communication of that  information\r\n\nto American Honda.\r\n\n     One might  ask why  there is  any basis  for a  claim of\r\n\nprivilege  in  the first  instance,  since  the privilege  is\r\n\nprimarily designed to protect communications by the client to\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe lawyer in  order to procure  legal advise.

Possibly some of the information was provided to the\r\n\nlaw  firm by American Honda employees.  Or the district court\r\n\nmay have  deemed the material privileged  (aside from waiver)\r\n\nbecause  the  lawyer's  communications  to   the  client  are\r\n\nsecondarily protected as needed to prevent inferring what the\r\n\nclient said to the lawyer.  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\r                                           \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r</span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n\n     In  all  events,  the question  here  is  the effect  of\r\n\nAmerican  Honda's  disclosure  of  this  information  to  the\r\n\ngovernment.

But, once  again,  the distinction\r\n\nappears to have little to do with the present problem.\r\n\n     Here, the  gist of the  matter is that  counsel informed\r\n\nthe  client of  detailed evidence and  allegations concerning\r\n\npossible bribes  of its  employees, and  the client  chose to\r\n\nmake this same information available to the government.  What\r\n\nis sought by the defense in the criminal trial is merely  the\r\n\nrecordations by or for the  client of this same  information.\r\n\nThe information  now having been  disclosed by the  client to\r\n\nthe government, it  is unclear what  damage to the  attorney-\r\n\nclient  privilege  can occur  from  making the  corresponding\r\n\nportions of the file available.  the district court carefully\r\n\nlimited the disclosures to the factual allegations, excluding\r\n\nany commentary on their legal implications.\r\n\n     Indeed, American Honda's disclosure to the government of\r\n\nthe  factual information received from  its law firm not only\r\n\nreveals that  information, and American  Honda's knowledge of\r\n\nit, but makes an  inquiry into the  source and basis for  the\r\n\ninformation hard to avoid.   A risk of unfairness  is evident\r\n\nwhere  information is provided to  one side in  a case (here,\r\n\nthe United States)  and then  an inquiry into  its origin  is\r\n\nshielded by a claim of privilege.   In a variety of contexts,\r\n\nthe affirmative  use of privileged information  has been held\r\n\nto  be a waiver of  privilege.  See  P. Rice, Attorney-Client\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nPrivilege in the United States   9.34, at 711,    938, 9.40  \r                                          \r\n\n950, at 752-53 (1993) (collecting cases).\r\n\n     Given the disclosure to the government, the waiver label\r\n\nis presumptively apt.   Waiver doctrine has only a  few hard-\r\n\nedged rules; as to many permutations,  it is a fluid body  of\r\n\nprecedent  reflecting a  variety  of  concerns, including  an\r\n\ninsistence on  real confidentiality and limitations  based on\r\n\nfairness.

The  concern,  of  course, is  to  encourage  such\r\n\nrevelations.  The  general tendency  of the law  is to  treat\r\n\nwaivers  as an  all-or-nothing  proposition, e.g.,  ALI Model\r                                                                         \r\n\nCode  of Evidence, Rule 231, comment (a) (1942); but there is\r                             \r\n\na  trace  of  support  for  limited  waivers  in  some  cases\r\n\ninvolving   confidential   disclosures  to   the  government.\r\n\nDiversified Industries,  Inc. v.

If there  were ever an  argument for limited\r\n\nwaiver, it  might well  depend importantly  on just  what had\r\n\nbeen disclosed to the  government and on what understandings.\r\n\nWithout intending  to preclude such  an argument in  a future\r\n\ncase, we think that it  is enough in this one to  say that no\r\n\nsuch claim of limited waiver has been argued to us.\r\n\n     This discussion also disposes of the alternative request\r\n\nfor mandamus.   Mandamus is a discretionary writ available in\r\n\nextraordinary  circumstances  to   redress  grievous   error.\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524263\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Garcia,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/524263/corporacion-insular-de-seguros-v-hon-juan-antonio-garcia-appeal-of-dr/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  at <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.   While  it is  not restricted  to\r                  \r\n\nerrors of law, it does require that the error be manifest and\r\n\nthe burden of  showing manifest error  is upon the  applicant\r\n\nfor the writ.  No such legal error has been  shown and, as to\r\n\nthe  district  court's   fact-findings  and  applications  of\r\n\nsettled rules to particular  facts, it is enough to  say that\r\n\nwe have found no manifest error.\r\n\n     Judgment has  been previously  entered.
