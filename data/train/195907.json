Petitioner-\n\nAppellant Alan D. Roberts challenges the constitutionality of his\n\nconviction  and  sentence under  this law  because, prior  to his\n\ndecision not to take  a blood/alcohol test, (1) a  police officer\n\ninformed Roberts  of \"the consequences\"  of refusing to  take the\n\ntest but did not mention the mandatory jail sentence, and (2) the\n\npolice  officer denied Roberts' request to call his attorney.  We\n\nfind  that  under  the  particular circumstances  of  this  case,\n\nRoberts' constitutional right to due process was violated and his\n\npetition for writ of habeas corpus must be granted as to his two-\n\nday mandatory sentence.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          On  January   25,  1991,  Officer  Alan   Main  of  the\n\nWaterville, Maine Police Department stopped Roberts after Officer\n\nMain observed Roberts driving  erratically.  Officer Main smelled\n\nalcohol  on Roberts'  breath  and suspected  Roberts was  driving\n\nwhile  intoxicated   but  initially  arrested  Roberts  only  for\n\noperating a vehicle with  a suspended license in violation  of 29\n\nM.R.S.A.     2184.    Officer Main  handcuffed  Roberts  and then\n\ntransported him to the  Waterville Police Station for processing.\n\nRoberts remained in handcuffs throughout the relevant time period\n\nat issue in this case.\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          At  the  police  station,  Officer  Main  read  Maine's\n\n\"implied  consent\" form to Roberts, which is normally read to any\n\ndriver  stopped or arrested for operating  under the influence of\n\nintoxicating liquor pursuant  to 29  M.R.S.A.   1312.   The  form\n\nstates:\n\n            By operating  or attempting to  operate a\n            motor vehicle in  this State  you have  a\n            duty to submit  to and complete  chemical\n            tests  to  determine  your  blood-alcohol\n            level and drug concentration.\n\n            I will  give you  a breath test  unless I\n            decide it is unreasonable, in  which case\n            another chemical test will be  given.  If\n            you are  requested to  take a blood  test\n            you  may ask that  your physician perform\n            the  test if your physician is reasonably\n            available.\n\n            If you  fail to comply with  your duty to\n            submit  to  and  complete chemical  tests\n            your driver's license or permit  or right\n            to apply for or  obtain a license will be\n            suspended for  at least 6 months  and may\n            be suspended  as long  as 3 years.   Your\n            failure to  submit to a chemical  test is\n            admissible against  you at any  trial for\n            operating  while  under the  influence of\n            intoxicating liquor or drugs.\n\n            I  have been advised  of the consequences\n            of  failure to  comply  with the  duty to\n            submit to and complete a chemical test at\n            the request of an officer and DO NOT WISH\n            TO SUBMIT TO A TEST.\n\n                                 \n                                 Signature  of   Person  Refusing\nTest\n\n          Maine's  implied consent  form  essentially tracks  the\n\nlanguage of the \"implied consent\" statute which requires officers\n\nto  warn suspected  drunk  drivers of  potential consequences  of\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nrefusing to take the blood/alcohol test.  29 M.R.S.A.   1312.  As\n\nthe statute was originally enacted, the only two consequences for\n\nfailure  to consent were, as  the form states,  suspension of the\n\nsuspect's driver's license and the admission of the fact that the\n\nsuspect refused  to take the test in evidence at trial.  In 1987,\n\nhowever, the Maine legislature amended its statute to provide two\n\nadditional  consequences, both involving sentencing, for refusing\n\nto take a blood/alcohol test.   1987 Maine Laws, ch. 791.   Under\n\nthe current  law, a defendant's refusal to  submit to the test is\n\nconsidered to be an \"aggravating factor\" for the determination of\n\nthat  defendant's   sentence   and,  more   significantly,   that\n\ndefendant's refusal  will result in a  mandatory minimum sentence\n\nof 48 hours incarceration  upon conviction.  29 M.R.S.A.    1312-\n\nB(2) &amp; (2)(B)(4).\n\n          Unfortunately,  these changes  did not  make their  way\n\ninto  the portion of the  statute mandating what  the police must\n\nsay to suspected  drunk drivers after those drivers  are stopped.\n\n29 M.R.S.A.   1312(1).   As a result, the \"implied  consent\" form\n\nwas  never changed  to  reflect the  additional consequences  for\n\nrefusing to  submit to  a blood/alcohol  test.   Likewise, during\n\nRoberts'  processing at  the police  station, Officer  Main never\n\ninformed Roberts  of the  additional consequences,  including the\n\nmandatory jail sentence. \n\n          During the period  when Officer Main was  administering\n\nthe \"implied consent\" procedure to Roberts, Roberts asked several\n\ntimes  to  use  the telephone  for  the  purpose  of calling  his\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nattorney.   Officer  Main  refused to  allow  Roberts to  do  so.\n\nOfficer Main claimed that he denied Roberts permission to contact\n\nhisattorneybecauseRobertswas uncooperativeandshoutingobscenities.\n\n          Roberts  eventually refused  to take  the blood/alcohol\n\ntest.  He  also refused to sign the \"implied  consent\" form after\n\nthe  form was  read  to him.   Subsequently,  the police  filed a\n\ncriminal  complaint  against  Roberts charging  him,  among other\n\nthings, with  operating a  motor vehicle under  the influence  of\n\nintoxicating liquor (\"OUI\") and  operating on a suspended license\n\nin violation  of 29  M.R.S.A.    1312-B and  29  M.R.S.A.    2184\n\nrespectively.   \n\n          After a trial in the Maine district court,  Roberts was\n\nconvicted  on  the OUI  and  operating  on  a  suspended  license\n\ncharges.  At sentencing, the  court followed the requirements  of\n\n29 M.R.S.A.    1312-B(2)(B)(4) and imposed  the mandatory minimum\n\n48-hour sentence of incarceration as a result of Roberts' refusal\n\nto take a  blood/alcohol test.1  Roberts appealed  his conviction\n\nto  the  Kennebec County  Superior Court  and  then to  the Maine\n\nSupreme Judicial Court.  Both appellate courts denied his appeal.\n\nFollowing  remand  for   the  imposition  of   sentence,  Roberts\n\ninitiated  a Petition  for Writ  of Habeas  Corpus in  the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Maine.  The Maine state\n\ntrial court ordered the  sentence of incarceration stayed pending\n\nthe  outcome of proceedings on  the habeas corpus  petition.  The\n                    \r                              \n\n1   The court also imposed a 90-day license suspension and a fine\nfor  Roberts' conviction  of  the substantive  offenses of  drunk\ndriving and driving with a suspended license. \n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nfederal district court dismissed  Roberts' habeas corpus petition\n\non October 29, 1993.  Roberts then brought this appeal.\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n                          II.  ANALYSIS\r                                    II.  ANALYSIS\n\n          Roberts  raises  two  related  issues  on  appeal:  (1)\n\nwhether  Officer Main's  refusal  to allow  Roberts  to call  his\n\nattorney  before deciding  whether to  take a  blood/alcohol test\n\ndenied Roberts of his  Sixth Amendment right to counsel;  and (2)\n\nwhether  Maine's  \"implied   consent\"  form  is   misleading  and\n\ninaccurate, in violation of  Roberts' constitutional right to due\n\nprocess.  Although  Roberts' Sixth Amendment right to  counsel is\n\nnot implicated  in this case, we do  find a violation of Roberts'\n\ndue process rights on  the grounds that all of  the circumstances\n\nof  the  case, including,  but  not  limited to,  the  misleading\n\ninformation, deprived Roberts of fundamental fairness.\n\n          A.  Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel \r                    A.  Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel\r                                                        \n\n          The Sixth Amendment to  the United States  Constitution\n\nguarantees  that, \"[i]n  all criminal  prosecutions, the  accused\n\nshall enjoy the right to . . . have the Assistance of Counsel for\n\nhis defense.\"  U.S. Const.  amend. VI.  It is axiomatic  that the\n\nright to counsel attaches only  upon \"the initiation of adversary\n\njudicial  criminal  proceedings\"   against  the  defendant,   and\n\nthereafter  the right  applies to  all \"critical  stages\" of  the\n\nprosecution, before,  during and after  trial.

In general terms,  the point at which the right  to counsel\n\nattaches is  when \"formal charges\"  have been  initiated or  when\n\n\"the government  has committed  itself to  prosecute.\"  Moran  v.\r                                                                       \n\nBurbine, 475 U.S. 412,  430-32 (1986); Gouveia, 467 U.S.  at 189;\r                                                        \n\nKirby,  406  U.S.  at  689.    \"By  its  very terms,  [the  Sixth\r               \n\nAmendment]  becomes applicable  only when  the  government's role\n\nshifts from investigation  to accusation.   For it  is only  then\n\nthat the assistance of  one versed in the 'intricacies   . . . of\n\nlaw,'  . .  .  is  needed to  assure that  the prosecution's case\n\nencounters 'the  crucible  of meaningful  adversarial  testing.'\"\n\nMoran, 475 U.S. at  430 (1986) (quoting United States  v. Cronic,\r                                                                          \n\n466 U.S. 648, 656 (1984)).\n\n          In the  present case,  state officials had  not brought\n\nany  formal charges against Roberts for drunk driving at the time\n\nRoberts  refused to take the blood/alcohol test.  The first state\n\naction  that  could conceivably  resemble  a  formal charge,  the\n\nfiling of the criminal complaint against Roberts for OUI, did not\n\noccur until after  Roberts refused to submit to the  test.  Thus,\n\nat the point  when Roberts was  denied his request to  speak with\n\nhis attorney, the government had not yet committed to prosecuting\n\nhim for OUI, nor had the government shifted its role from that of\n\ninvestigation to  accusation.  We find,  therefore, that Roberts'\n\nright to  counsel had  not attached  at the  time of the  alleged\n\nviolation of his Sixth  Amendment rights.  See McVeigh  v. Smith,\r                                                                          \n\n872  F.2d 725  (6th Cir.  1989) (finding  that the  Supreme Court\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nrejected the argument that a suspect's right to counsel  attaches\n\nprior  to  taking a  blood alcohol  test  in Nyflot  v.

According to\n\nRoberts,  the mandatory  sentencing consequences  of  refusing to\n\ntake  the  blood/alcohol  test,   combined  with  the  misleading\n\ninformation  provided by  Maine regarding  the consequences  that\n\nwould arise from his refusal  to take the test and the  denial of\n\nRoberts'  request   to  call  his   attorney  to  clear   up  the\n\nmisunderstanding, somehow transformed the  normally investigatory\n\ntesting  procedure  into  an   adversarial,  quasi-prosecutorial,\n\nsentencing proceeding.   Appealing as  this argument  may be,  we\n\nmust  reject it.   Whatever  limited circumstances  may  exist in\n\nwhich the right to counsel attaches prior to a formal charge,  it\n\ncannot include  the circumstances in the present case because the\n\npolice were still waiting for the  outcome of their investigation\n\n--  either from the results of the blood/alcohol test or from the\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nfact  of  defendant's refusal  to submit  to  the test  -- before\n\ndeciding whether or  not to bring charges  against the defendant.\n\nThe  government had  not  yet crossed  the constitutional  divide\n\nbetween investigator  and accuser.   As  a threshold matter,  the\n\nright to counsel had  not yet attached when Robert's  request for\n\ncounsel was  denied, and, therefore, we cannot reach the further,\n\nand admittedly close, question of whether or not Roberts decision\n\nto take the blood/alcohol test involved a \"critical stage\" of the\n\nprosecution  at which  the right  to have  the advice  of counsel\n\nwould otherwise be constitutionally required.\n\n          B.

The\n\npolice  officer took Roberts into custody  and, while Roberts was\n\nhandcuffed at  the police  station, presented  him with a  choice\n\nthat   had  irrevocable   sentencing  consequences   involving  a\n\nmandatory period of incarceration.   Roberts was asked to  take a\n\nblood/alcohol test and told that  if he refused to submit to  the\n\ntest,  his drivers license would be suspended and the fact of his\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nrefusal  could be used  against him at  trial.  Roberts  was then\n\ninformed that he had been \"advised of the consequences of failure\n\nto  comply.\"  This statement  was misleading because  there is at\n\nleast one additional consequence of failing to consent to a test:\n\na 48-hour term of incarceration.  Roberts was never told that his\n\nrefusal to take the test could also result in a mandatory two-day\n\njail  sentence if  he were to  be convicted of  driving under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol.   Thus,  Roberts was not  informed of  \"the\r                                                                           \n\nconsequences\"  of failing  to comply  with the  \"implied consent\"\n\nprocedure.\n\n          Following  Officer  Main's  reading  of   the  \"implied\n\nconsent\" form, Roberts asked to call his attorney before deciding\n\nwhether  or not  to take  the blood/alcohol  test.   Officer Main\n\ndenied  this  request,  despite   the  apparent  absence  of  any\n\ninconvenience or  unreasonable delay in allowing  the phone call.\n\nIf  allowed to speak with  his attorney, Roberts  could have been\n\ninformed  of the  sentencing consequences  of  a decision  not to\n\nsubmit to the blood/alcohol  test, thus clarifying the misleading\n\ninformation  provided by  Maine's  \"implied consent\"  form.   The\n\nattorney could have also  provided advice to Roberts at  the only\n\npoint during  the process for determining  Roberts' sentence when\n\nthe mandatory  consequences of the two-day  term of incarceration\n\ncould still be  avoided.   The attorney's advice  would come  too\n\nlate at the  sentencing hearing  itself, at which  time there  is\n\nnothing the attorney can  do to mitigate or rebut  the imposition\n\nof the  48-hour jail term.   Roberts thus had to  make a decision\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nwith irrevocable  consequences for  his sentence after  the state\n\nprovided  him  with  inaccurate  information with  which  he  was\n\nexpected to  make  that  decision.   Under  this  combination  of\n\ncircumstances,  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  state  to  honor  a\n\nreasonable request to call an attorney.  Refusing to provide this\n\nsimple safeguard violated Roberts' right to due process.\n\n          A   review  of   the  Mathews   factors   confirms  our\r                                                 \n\nconclusion.  The liberty interest deprived by the state's actions\n\nin  this case is Roberts' freedom from the mandatory two-day jail\n\nsentence imposed  because of the refusal to  take a blood/alcohol\n\ntest.    Roberts'  interest  in  freedom  from  incarceration  is\n\ncertainly worthy  of substantial  due process protections.   See,\r                                                                          \n\ne.g.,  United  States v.  Salerno,  481  U.S.  739,  750  (1987);\r                                           \n\nAddington  v. Texas, 441 U.S.  418, 423-25 (1979).   In addition,\r                             \n\nMaine placed Roberts in a position  where he was forced to make a\n\ndecision  between  cooperating with  investigators  and suffering\n\nmandatory   and  irrevocable  consequences   for  his  subsequent\n\nsentencing.  Cooperation in this  case would probably have sealed\n\nRoberts' fate at  trial but  it also would  have avoided  certain\n\nharsher penalties.   Roberts  thus faced  a situation  similar in\n\nsome  respects to  plea  bargaining.   As such,  Maine's \"implied\n\nconsent\"  procedure implicates  Roberts'  right  to receive  fair\n\ntreatment by the prosecution  during plea bargaining.  Santobello\r                                                                           \n\nv. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 261-62 (1971); Brady v. United States,\r                                                                          \n\n397 U.S. 742, 756-58  (1970); United States v. Bouthot,  878 F.2d\r                                                                \n\n1506, 1511 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n          Moreover,   the   mandatory   sentencing   consequences\n\nstemming  from Roberts'  refusal to  take the  blood/alcohol test\n\ninjects  important  elements  of  sentencing procedure  into  the\n\npolice investigation of a suspected OUI offense.  Because Roberts\n\ncan do  nothing to contest  the imposition  of a 48-hour  term of\n\nincarceration  at  the sentencing  hearing  itself, the  critical\n\npoint  for  calculating  a   key  portion  of  Roberts'  sentence\n\nessentially occurs at the  time Roberts is requested to  take the\n\nblood/alcohol test.  Thus, this case implicates Roberts' interest\n\nin fair sentencing procedures.  Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349,\r                                                            \n\n358 (1977); United States v. Doe, 655  F.2d 920, 927-28 (9th Cir.\r                                          \n\n1980).  We find, therefore, that Maine's actions  towards Roberts\n\nimplicate  important liberty  interests deserving  of substantial\n\ndue process protection.\n\n          Turning to the second  consideration under Mathews, the\r                                                                      \n\nrisk of erroneous  deprivation of  the liberty  interest and  the\n\nprobable value of  an additional procedural safeguard, we  find a\n\nstrong due process justification  for allowing Roberts to contact\n\nhis attorney.   Although Officer Main's refusal  to allow Roberts\n\nto call his attorney did not significantly increase the risk that\n\nRoberts would  be erroneously convicted  of an  OUI offense,  the\n\nofficer's conduct greatly  increased the risk that a two-day jail\n\nsentence would be imposed  on Roberts as  a result of a  decision\n\nmade  in reliance  upon  misleading information.   The  erroneous\n\ndeprivation thus consists of attaching sentencing consequences to\n\na choice  that an  individual may  not  have made  had the  state\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nprovided him or her  with accurate information.  In  other words,\n\nabsent the inaccurate information, the  two-day jail term may not\n\nhave been imposed.\n\n          We  are faced here with a unique situation in which the\n\nsentencing consequences of incarceration  are imposed not so much\n\nfor the  substantive criminal conduct itself but for the separate\n\nvolitional act of refusing to cooperate with the investigation of\n\nthat conduct.  As  such, an erroneous deprivation of  liberty can\n\nresult   from  a   suspect's   behavior   under  rather   dubious\n\ncircumstances,  if not false pretenses, created by the state.  In\n\nthis  case, Roberts might have chosen to cooperate and thus avoid\n\nthe mandatory term  of incarceration  if he had  been allowed  to\n\nspeak  with his lawyer and  correct the inaccurate information he\n\nreceived.   Once Roberts'  decision was made,  however, there was\n\nnothing  the attorney or judge  could do at  sentencing to remedy\n\nRoberts' tainted decision.\n\n          On  the  other side  of the  coin,  there is  much that\n\nallowing  Roberts to  call  his attorney  could  do to  safeguard\n\nagainst the type of  erroneous deprivation of liberty at  risk in\n\nthis  case.   Plainly and  simply, Roberts'  attorney could  have\n\ninformed  Roberts of  the additional  sentencing  consequences of\n\nrefusing  to take  the  blood/alcohol test,  thus correcting  the\n\nstate's misleading information.   The attorney could also counsel\n\nRoberts on the advisability of cooperating to avoid the mandatory\n\ntwo-day sentence.  This is  the only point at which such  counsel\n\nhas any  value; once the decision whether or not to submit to the\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\ntest is made, the die is cast, and nothing the attorney can do at\n\nsentencing will mitigate the effect of the two-day sentence.\n\n          The present situation  thus presents concerns analogous\n\nto  those expressed by the Supreme Court  in many of its right to\n\ncounsel cases.   See Wade,  388 U.S.  at 224 (affording  right to\r                                   \n\ncounsel at  critical pre-trial  stages of proceedings  \"where the\n\nresults might well settle the accused's fate and reduce the trial\n\nitself to a  mere formality\");  Ash, 413 U.S.  at 315-16  (noting\r                                             \n\nthat \"there were  times when  the subsequent trial  would cure  a\n\none-sided confrontation between  prosecuting authorities and  the\n\nuncounseled defendant,\"  rendering  the absence  of  an  attorney\n\nacceptable,  but that there were other times when an attorney was\n\nrequired  because there was no  such \"opportunity to cure defects\n\nat trial\"); Maine v.

We\r                                                \n\ntherefore  conclude  that   Maine's  implied  consent   procedure\n\npresents a  substantial risk of erroneous  deprivation of liberty\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nand  that  allowing Roberts  to call  his  attorney is  likely to\n\nalleviate  the  risk  and,  as such,  is  a  valuable  procedural\n\nsafeguard.\n\n          Finally,  we consider the  state's interest in refusing\n\nto   allow  Roberts   to   call  his   attorney,  including   any\n\nadministrative and fiscal burdens such a phone call would entail.\n\nThere  is nothing in the record to indicate that allowing Roberts\n\nto call  his lawyer from the  police station would impose  on the\n\npolice any meaningful burden whatsoever.   On the contrary, Maine\n\nlaw  allows  for suspected  drunk  drivers to  request  their own\n\nphysician  to  conduct  the  blood/alcohol  test   if  reasonably\n\navailable.   29 M.R.S.A.   1312.  Maine thus already contemplates\n\nmaking  reasonable accommodations  for  drunk  driving  suspects.\n\nAllowing  a simple  phone  call  to  an  attorney  is  much  less\n\nintrusive on the implied consent process than arranging a medical\n\nprocedure with the suspect's doctor.\n\n          Given  the transient  nature of  the evidence  in drunk\n\ndriving  cases -- that is, the blood/alcohol level in a suspect's\n\nblood  -- the  police  may  certainly  proceed with  the  implied\n\nconsent procedure if  a delay  would affect the  test results  or\n\notherwise  interfere with the testing procedure.   The police may\n\nrefuse  to wait for a suspect who  is unable to reach an attorney\n\nwithin a reasonable period  of time or refuse to  undertake time-\n\nconsuming and  burdensome efforts to  contact an attorney  who is\n\nnot immediately available.  There is no indication, however, that\n\nsuch was the case here.   Officer Main testified that he  did not\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nallow  Roberts   to  call   his  attorney  because   Roberts  was\n\nuncooperative and shouting  obscenities.  We see  no relevance of\n\nthis fact to any state  interest in refusing to allow Roberts  to\n\nmake  a phone  call before  deciding whether or  not to  take the\n\nblood/alcohol  test.   We  therefore  find  no significant  state\n\ninterest in refusing to  allow Roberts to call his  attorney that\n\nwould justify what we consider to be a denial of due process. \n\n          To  clarify, we  do  not discount  Maine's interest  in\n\nimposing an implied consent  procedure to encourage the voluntary\n\ntesting of drunk drivers, nor do we have any quarrel with Maine's\n\ndesire  to   impose  harsher  penalties  on   those  refusing  to\n\ncooperate.   We see very  little interest, however,  in denying a\n\nreasonable request  at the  police station  to call an  attorney,\n\nwhere  that call could  serve to clear  up misleading information\n\nregarding the testing procedure provided by the state.\n\n          Furthermore, we do  not find,  in this  case at  least,\n\nthat a suspected drunk driver has a due process  right to contact\n\nan  attorney  whenever  the  state  imposes mandatory  sentencing\n\nconsequences  upon   the  refusal  of  the  suspect   to  take  a\n\nblood/alcohol test.  Rather, we find that where the suspect makes\n\na  reasonable  request to  contact his  or  her attorney  and the\n\nattorney can correct misleading information provided by the state\n\nat a  point when the suspect must make a decision that is crucial\n\nfor his or her  subsequent sentencing, due process requires  that\n\nthe suspect's request be honored.\n\n          We  are  confronted  with  a   substantially  different\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nsituation  in this  case  than the  one  that the  Supreme  Court\n\nconsidered  in South Dakota v. Neville, 459  U.S. 553 (1983).  In\r                                                \n\nNeville, the Supreme Court  held that the Due Process  Clause was\r                 \n\nnot violated when  a police  officer failed to  warn a  suspected\n\ndrunk driver that his  refusal to submit to a  blood-alcohol test\n\ncould be  used against him  at trial.   The  Court reasoned  that\n\nbecause the drunk  driver in  that case  was specifically  warned\n\nthat  his refusal  to  submit to  the test  would  result in  the\n\nsuspension  of his license, the driver knew that his refusal \"was\n\nnot a 'safe  harbor,' free of adverse consequences.\"  Id. at 566.\r                                                                  \n\nThe Court also  noted that it  was \"unrealistic  to say that  the\n\nwarnings  given   here  implicitly  assure  a   suspect  that  no\n\nconsequences other than those mentioned will occur.\"  Id.2 \r                                                                  \n\n          Unlike  Neville,  the  present  case is  not  a  simple\r                                   \n\n\"failure to  warn\" situation  involving a state's  withholding of\n\ninformation  that it was never required to provide.  Rather, this\n\nis  a  case in  which a  mandatory  sentence of  incarceration is\n\nattached to  a suspect's decision  to take a  blood/alcohol test,\n\nwhere the suspect is  given misleading information that indicates\n\nno  such sentence  exists;  and further,  where  that suspect  is\n\ndenied  permission to speak to an attorney who could have cleared\n\nup the misunderstanding and who could have provided advice at the\n                    \r                              \n\n2  The instructions  given to the defendant in  Neville contained\r                                                                 \nno language resembling the misleading statement in this case that\nthe  suspect  had  been  \"advised  of  the  consequences.\"    The\ninstructions in Neville  merely informed the  suspect that if  he\r                                 \nrefused to  take  a  blood/alcohol  test, his  license  could  be\nsuspended.  The suspect was then merely asked: \"Do you understand\nwhat I told you?\"  Neville, 459 U.S. at 555 n.2.\r                                    \n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nonly point  where the  sentencing consequences could  be avoided.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not address the due process implications of\n\nthese  circumstances.    Instead,  Neville  dealt  with  a  quite\r                                                    \n\ndifferent  issue:  the  due  process implications  of  a  state's\n\nfailure to  warn about the use at trial of a suspect's refusal to\n\ntake a blood/alcohol test.  The differences between the two cases\n\nare stark.\n\n          First,  Neville considered  an interest  of much  lower\r                                   \n\nmagnitude  than   Roberts'  liberty  interest  in   freedom  from\n\nincarceration.  As the Supreme Court  found, the use of the  fact\n\nthat a suspect  refused to submit to  a test as evidence  against\n\nthat  suspect at  trial  does not  implicate the  suspect's Fifth\n\nAmendment right  against  self-incrimination.    Id.  at  558-64.\r                                                             \n\nThus, the suspect in Neville had no  protectable liberty interest\r                                      \n\nbeyond the  general right to  a fair trial,  a right which  faced\n\nlittle risk of erroneous  deprivation in that case.   Neville did\r                                                                       \n\nnot  involve  a  mandatory  sentence  that  risked  depriving  an\n\nindividual  of the  important  liberty interest  of freedom  from\n\nincarceration, a liberty interest that is involved here.\n\n          Second, the  consequence about  which  Maine failed  to\n\nwarn Roberts in the present case is irrevocable and irrebuttable,\n\nmaking the  suggested procedural safeguard --  permission to call\n\nan attorney  -- crucial to protecting  Roberts' liberty interest.\n\nIn  the  Neville  case,  however, the  consequences  involved  an\r                          \n\nevidentiary disadvantage  that  could be  rebutted, mitigated  or\n\notherwise explained by counsel at trial.  The blood/alcohol test,\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\ntherefore,  was  not  the  only  point  in  Neville  at  which  a\r                                                             \n\nprocedural safeguard would have had any value.\n\n          Third, there is an  additional element of unfairness in\n\nthis  case, not found in Neville, due to the misleading nature of\r                                          \n\nthe  instructions given  to Roberts.   In  the Neville  case, the\r                                                                \n\nSupreme Court  specifically noted that  the suspect was  given no\n\nimplicit  assurances  that  he  was  being   warned  of  all  the\n\nconsequences  of  refusing to  submit  to  testing,  id. at  566,\r                                                                 \n\nwhereas in  this case, Roberts was told  that he had been advised\n\nof \"the  consequences,\" incorrectly  implying that there  were no\n\nadditional consequences.   As a  result, Roberts faced  a greater\n\nrisk  of erroneous deprivation of his liberty than the suspect in\n\nNeville.\r                 \n\n          Due   process   may   not  require   warnings   of  the\n\nconsequences of refusing to take a blood/alcohol test, and it may\n\nnot  require  a full  right to  counsel  for suspects  facing the\n\ndecision  whether or  not  to  submit  to  testing.    Under  the\n\ncircumstances of this case, however, as a matter of fair play and\n\ndecency,  due  process  does  require  that  Roberts  be  given a\n\nreasonable opportunity  to call  his attorney before  deciding on\n\nwhether to be tested.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\n\n          For the  foregoing reasons, we find  that the mandatory\n\n48-hour jail  sentence imposed  on Roberts  pursuant  to    1312-\n\nB(2)(B)(4)  violates  due  process.     The  infirmities  in  the\n\nprocedures surrounding  Roberts' arrest did  not, however,  taint\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nhis underlying  convictions for drunk driving and  driving with a\n\nsuspended  license.

First,  the\nsuspect is never informed  of the most serious, unmitigable,  and\nirremediable sanction  for refusing to  be tested.   Second, were\nthe  State to  choose  to force  testing  upon the  suspect  not-\nwithstanding  his refusal, it is far from clear that the \"option\"\nof  refusal  would  avail  the  suspect  anything  other  than  a\nmandatory minimum sentence.

The Smith  court reasoned that  an alleged  \"mixed\r                                  \nmessage\" from a police officer \"could not have reasonably invited\n[the defendant's]  reliance. .  .\" because  it was  never claimed\nthat the officer informed Smith that his conduct was lawful.

Although   it  is\npreconditioned on an OUI conviction, all meaningful discretion on\nthe  part of  the sentencing  court is  withdrawn as  an unwarned\nconsequence of  the defendant's noncriminal refusal  to submit to\ntesting.  Second, no mitigating circumstances, either in relation\nto  the refusal to be tested  or the commission of the underlying\noffense,  can enable the  court to  sentence below  the mandatory\nminimum.    Third, the  statutory  description  of the  mandatory\nminimum  sentence  for refusing  testing      as an  \"aggravating\nfactor,\" see   1312-B(2)  (\"refusal to submit to  a chemical test\r                      \nshall  in every case  be an aggravating  factor\")     is itself a\nmisleading euphemism for what is in reality a conclusive sentenc-\r                                                                           \ning  mandate which the court  is required not  merely to consider\r                                                   \nbut to impose without regard to any mitigating circumstance.  \n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\nconviction  obtained through  procedural due  process violation);\n\nWright, 373 U.S. at 287 (same).\r                \n\n          (ii) The Risk of Erroneous Deprivation\r                    (ii) The Risk of Erroneous Deprivation\r                                                          \n\n          The risk that an  erroneous deprivation of liberty will\n\noccur  is roughly  commensurate with  the relevance  the unwarned\n\nconsequence  bears to  the  decision  to  refuse  testing.    The\n\nunwarned  mandatory  term  of  confinement     the  most  serious\n\nconsequence     surely  bears  great relevance  to the  \"no-test\"\n\ndecision;  even a  presumptively determinative  relevance in  the\n\npresent circumstances.\n\n          Significant  derivative risks attach  to the inaccurate\n\nadvisory  as  well.   No  doubt  there  are  many first-time  OUI\n\nsuspects with neither  the knowledge nor the experience to assess\n\nwhether  their blood-alcohol  content  exceeds  the  prima  facie\r                                                                           \n\nintoxication level  prescribed by statute.  For such suspects, at\n\nleast,  it cannot  be claimed  that an  accurate advisory  on the\n\nmandatory minimum term of confinement attendant upon a refusal to\n\nsubmit to testing would  not materially influence their decision.\n\nThus,  the deceptive  \"implied consent\"  advisory not  only risks\n\nerroneous  conviction  (e.g., as  a  consequence  of allowing  an\r                                      \n\nunwarned  refusal in  evidence  where chemical  testing may  have\n\nrevealed a blood-alcohol content below the prima facie level) but\r                                                                \n\na sentence more severe than would have been imposed by the  court\r                    \n\nbut  for the suspect's unwarned refusal to be tested (e.g., where\r                                                                    \n\nreliable  test  results  would  have  disclosed  a  blood-alcohol\n\ncontent below the prima facie intoxication level).\r                                       \n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\n          The  undeniable value  of  a ready  alternative to  the\n\ndeceptive advisory is  obvious.  The legitimate  interests of the\n\nState, as well as the accused, would be significantly advanced by\n\nthe  simple inclusion of a  straightforward warning that a first-\n\ntime refusal to submit to chemical  testing must be followed by a\n\nminimum term of confinement upon conviction for operating a motor\n\nvehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Indeed,  it  is\n\ndifficult to  posit a legitimate governmental  interest served by\r                                          \n\nimplicitly misleading  OUI suspects  into refusing to  be tested.\r                                                            \n\nRather,  the State's  legitimate interest  in obtaining  the most\n\nreliable   evidence  of   intoxication,  through   the  voluntary\n\n                               -44-\r\r\n\ncooperation  of OUI  suspects, is better  served by  advising the\r                                                  \n\nsuspect of all sanctions for refusing testing.\r                                               \n\n          The State  has a  paramount interest in  minimizing any\n\npre-testing   delay  which  might  render  chemical-test  results\n\nunreliable.  See  Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770-71.   In all likeli-\r                                     \n\nhood,   however,  a  simple,  straightforward  amendment  to  the\n\nstandard advisory  would expedite chemical testing; certainly, it\n\nwould not  delay it.16   And the  effort to eradicate  the tragic\n\nconsequences  of  drunken  driving  on Maine  highways  would  be\n\nadvanced thereby, rather than hindered. \n\n          The  ease with  which an  alternative procedure  can be\n\nimplemented  likewise weighs heavily in favor  of an amendment to\n\nthe standard advisory,  see Mathews,  424 U.S. at  348 (\"At  some\r                                             \n\npoint  the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual .\n\n. . may be  outweighed by the cost.\"), especially  since it would\n\noccasion neither pre-testing delay nor significant expense.\n\n          As  the  mandatory  minimum  sentence  was  imposed  in\n\nviolation of the Due Process Clause, I agree that the writ should\n\nenter  in  the event  the  State of  Maine  does  not vacate  the\n\nmandatory  minimum sentence  and afford  petitioner  a meaningful\n\n                    \r                              \n\n16  The majority opinion persuasively demonstrates  that no Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel arose until well after Roberts refused\nto be tested.

Secs. 1312, 1312-B.  Petitioner-Appellant Alan D. Roberts challenges the constitutionality of his conviction and sentence under this law because, prior to his decision not to take a blood/alcohol test, (1) a police officer informed Roberts of \"the consequences\" of refusing to take the test but did not mention the mandatory jail sentence, and (2) the police officer denied Roberts' request to call his attorney.  We find that under the particular circumstances of this case, Roberts' constitutional right to due process was violated and his petition for writ of habeas corpus must be granted as to his two-day mandatory sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1991, Officer Alan Main of the Waterville, Maine Police Department stopped Roberts after Officer Main observed Roberts driving erratically.  Officer Main smelled alcohol on Roberts' breath and suspected Roberts was driving while intoxicated but initially arrested Roberts only for operating a vehicle with a suspended license in violation of 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 2184.  Officer Main handcuffed Roberts and then transported him to the Waterville Police Station for processing.  Roberts remained in handcuffs throughout the relevant time period at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the police station, Officer Main read Maine's \"implied consent\" form to Roberts, which is normally read to any driver stopped or arrested for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor pursuant to 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312.  The form states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>By operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle in this State you have a duty to submit to and complete chemical tests to determine your blood-alcohol level and drug concentration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>I will give you a breath test unless I decide it is unreasonable, in which case another chemical test will be given.  If you are requested to take a blood test you may ask that your physician perform the test if your physician is reasonably available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>If you fail to comply with your duty to submit to and complete chemical tests your driver's license or permit or right to apply for or obtain a license will be suspended for at least 6 months and may be suspended as long as 3 years.  Your failure to submit to a chemical test is admissible against you at any trial for operating while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>I have been advised of the consequences of failure to comply with the duty to submit to and complete a chemical test at the request of an officer and DO NOT WISH TO SUBMIT TO A TEST.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Signature of Person Refusing Test</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Maine's implied consent form essentially tracks the language of the \"implied consent\" statute which requires officers to warn suspected drunk drivers of potential consequences of refusing to take the blood/alcohol test.  29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312.  As the statute was originally enacted, the only two consequences for failure to consent were, as the form states, suspension of the suspect's driver's license and the admission of the fact that the suspect refused to take the test in evidence at trial.  In 1987, however, the Maine legislature amended its statute to provide two additional consequences, both involving sentencing, for refusing to take a blood/alcohol test.  1987 Maine Laws, ch. 791.  Under the current law, a defendant's refusal to submit to the test is considered to be an \"aggravating factor\" for the determination of that defendant's sentence and, more significantly, that defendant's refusal will result in a mandatory minimum sentence of 48 hours incarceration upon conviction.  29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312-B(2) &amp; (2)(B)(4).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, these changes did not make their way into the portion of the statute mandating what the police must say to suspected drunk drivers after those drivers are stopped.  29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312(1).  As a result, the \"implied consent\" form was never changed to reflect the additional consequences for refusing to submit to a blood/alcohol test.  Likewise, during Roberts' processing at the police station, Officer Main never informed Roberts of the additional consequences, including the mandatory jail sentence.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">During the period when Officer Main was administering the \"implied consent\" procedure to Roberts, Roberts asked several times to use the telephone for the purpose of calling his attorney.  Officer Main refused to allow Roberts to do so.  Officer Main claimed that he denied Roberts permission to contact his attorney because Roberts was uncooperative and shouting obscenities.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Roberts eventually refused to take the blood/alcohol test.  He also refused to sign the \"implied consent\" form after the form was read to him.  Subsequently, the police filed a criminal complaint against Roberts charging him, among other things, with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor (\"OUI\") and operating on a suspended license in violation of 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312-B and 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 2184 respectively.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">After a trial in the Maine district court, Roberts was convicted on the OUI and operating on a suspended license charges.  At sentencing, the court followed the requirements of 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312-B(2)(B)(4) and imposed the mandatory minimum 48-hour sentence of incarceration as a result of Roberts' refusal to take a blood/alcohol test.<sup>1</sup> Roberts appealed his conviction to the Kennebec County Superior Court and then to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.  Both appellate courts denied his appeal.  Following remand for the imposition of sentence, Roberts initiated a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Maine.  The Maine state trial court ordered the sentence of incarceration stayed pending the outcome of proceedings on the habeas corpus petition.  The federal district court dismissed Roberts' habeas corpus petition on October 29, 1993.  Roberts then brought this appeal.</p>\n        <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Roberts raises two related issues on appeal:  (1) whether Officer Main's refusal to allow Roberts to call his attorney before deciding whether to take a blood/alcohol test denied Roberts of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel;  and (2) whether Maine's \"implied consent\" form is misleading and inaccurate, in violation of Roberts' constitutional right to due process.  Although Roberts' Sixth Amendment right to counsel is not implicated in this case, we do find a violation of Roberts' due process rights on the grounds that all of the circumstances of the case, including, but not limited to, the misleading information, deprived Roberts of fundamental fairness.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A. Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that, \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to ... have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  VI.  It is axiomatic that the right to counsel attaches only upon \"the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\" against the defendant, and thereafter the right applies to all \"critical stages\" of the prosecution, before, during and after trial.  United States v. Gouveia, 467 U.S. 180, 189, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 2298, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984);  United States v. Ash, 413 U.S. 300, 310-13, 93 S.Ct. 2568, 2574-75, 37 L.Ed.2d 619 (1973);  Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 688-90, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 1881-83, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972);  United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 225-27, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1931-32, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The initiation of adversary judicial proceedings is normally \"by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\"  Kirby, 406 U.S. at 689, 92 S.Ct. at 1882.   In general terms, the point at which the right to counsel attaches is when \"formal charges\" have been initiated or when \"the government has committed itself to prosecute.\"  Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 430-32, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 1145-47, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986);  Gouveia, 467 U.S. at 189, 104 S.Ct. at 2298;  Kirby, 406 U.S. at 689, 92 S.Ct. at 1882.  \"By its very terms, [the Sixth Amendment] becomes applicable only when the government's role shifts from investigation to accusation.  For it is only then that the assistance of one versed in the 'intricacies ... of law,' ... is needed to assure that the prosecution's case encounters 'the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.' \"  Moran, 475 U.S. at 430, 106 S.Ct. at 1146 (1986) (quoting United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2045, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984)).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, state officials had not brought any formal charges against Roberts for drunk driving at the time Roberts refused to take the blood/alcohol test.  The first state action that could conceivably resemble a formal charge, the filing of the criminal complaint against Roberts for OUI, did not occur until after Roberts refused to submit to the test.  Thus, at the point when Roberts was denied his request to speak with his attorney, the government had not yet committed to prosecuting him for OUI, nor had the government shifted its role from that of investigation to accusation.  We find, therefore, that Roberts' right to counsel had not attached at the time of the alleged violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.  See McVeigh v. Smith, 872 F.2d 725 (6th Cir.1989) (finding that the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a suspect's right to counsel attaches prior to taking a blood alcohol test in Nyflot v. Minnesota Comm'r of Public Safety, 474 U.S. 1027, 106 S.Ct. 586, 88 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985), in which the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal raising the right to counsel argument for lack of substantial federal question);  Langelier v. Coleman, 861 F.2d 1508, 1510 n. 3 (11th Cir.1988) (noting right to counsel had not yet attached when suspect was asked to take a blood/alcohol test).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We recognize the possibility that the right to counsel might conceivably attach before any formal charges are made, or before an indictment or arraignment, in circumstances where the \" 'government had crossed the constitutionally significant divide from fact-finder to adversary.' \"  United States v. Larkin, 978 F.2d 964, 969 (7th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1323, 122 L.Ed.2d 709 (1993) (quoting United States Ex Rel. Hall v. Lane, 804 F.2d 79, 82 (7th Cir.1986)).  Such circumstances, however, must be extremely limited and, indeed, we are unable to cite many examples.  See Larkin, 978 F.2d at 969 (citing Bruce v. Duckworth, 659 F.2d 776, 783 (7th Cir.1981), for the proposition that the government may not intentionally delay formal charges for the purpose of holding a lineup outside the presence of counsel).  Overall, Supreme Court jurisprudence on the Sixth Amendment appears to allow for few exceptions to the bright-line rule that the right to counsel does not attach until the government initiates official proceedings by making a formal charge.  See United States v. Heinz, 983 F.2d 609, 612-13 (5th Cir.1993) (interpreting Gouveia, 467 U.S. at 187-90, 104 S.Ct. at 2296-99, and other Supreme Court precedent as establishing a strictly formal test for determining the initiation of judicial proceedings as opposed to a more functional test based on whether the government had taken on an adversarial stance towards the defendant or whether the government had focussed its investigation on the defendant);  see also Moran, 475 U.S. at 431, 106 S.Ct. at 1146 (\"The clear implication of the holding [in Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 106 S.Ct. 477, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) ], and one that confirms the teaching of Gouveia, is that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach until after the initiation of formal charges.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Roberts asserts that the special circumstances of this case establish a Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  According to Roberts, the mandatory sentencing consequences of refusing to take the blood/alcohol test, combined with the misleading information provided by Maine regarding the consequences that would arise from his refusal to take the test and the denial of Roberts' request to call his attorney to clear up the misunderstanding, somehow transformed the normally investigatory testing procedure into an adversarial, quasi-prosecutorial, sentencing proceeding.  Appealing as this argument may be, we must reject it.  Whatever limited circumstances may exist in which the right to counsel attaches prior to a formal charge, it cannot include the circumstances in the present case because the police were still waiting for the outcome of their investigation--either from the results of the blood/alcohol test or from the fact of defendant's refusal to submit to the test--before deciding whether or not to bring charges against the defendant.  The government had not yet crossed the constitutional divide between investigator and accuser.  As a threshold matter, the right to counsel had not yet attached when Robert's request for counsel was denied, and, therefore, we cannot reach the further, and admittedly close, question of whether or not Roberts decision to take the blood/alcohol test involved a \"critical stage\" of the prosecution at which the right to have the advice of counsel would otherwise be constitutionally required.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">B. Due Process</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We do find merit, however, in Roberts' claim that Officer Main's actions violated Roberts' right to due process.  The combination of circumstances in this case presents a unique situation in which the state of Maine failed to meet the requirements of fundamental fairness.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause of the Constitution prohibits deprivations of life, liberty, or property without \"fundamental fairness\" through governmental conduct that offends the community's sense of justice, decency and fair play.  Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 432-34, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 1146-48, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986);  United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 432, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1643, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973);  Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 442, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 1514-15, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960);  Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172-73, 72 S.Ct. 205, 209-10, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952);  United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 560 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 148, 126 L.Ed.2d 110 (1993).  \"Due process\" is a flexible concept--\"the processes required by the Clause with respect to the termination of a protected interest will vary depending upon the importance attached to the interest and the particular circumstances under which the deprivation may occur.\"  Walters v. National Ass'n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 320, 105 S.Ct. 3180, 3189, 87 L.Ed.2d 220 (1985).  The test for determining whether state action violates the Due Process Clause, formally set out in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), requires a court to consider:  (1) the private interest that will be affected by the government's action;  (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the existing procedure and the probable utility of additional or substitute procedural safeguards;  and (3) the government's interest in adhering to the existing procedure, including fiscal and administrative burdens that additional procedures might entail.  Id.; Walters, 473 U.S. at 321, 105 S.Ct. at 3189;  Mackey v. Montrym, 443 U.S. 1, 10, 99 S.Ct. 2612, 2617, 61 L.Ed.2d 321 (1979);  In re Nineteen Appeals Arising Out of San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 982 F.2d 603, 611 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We find that Officer Main's actions in this case deprived Roberts of liberty in a manner lacking in fundamental fairness and offensive to the universal sense of fair play.  The police officer took Roberts into custody and, while Roberts was handcuffed at the police station, presented him with a choice that had irrevocable sentencing consequences involving a mandatory period of incarceration.  Roberts was asked to take a blood/alcohol test and told that if he refused to submit to the test, his drivers license would be suspended and the fact of his refusal could be used against him at trial.  Roberts was then informed that he had been \"advised of the consequences of failure to comply.\"   This statement was misleading because there is at least one additional consequence of failing to consent to a test:  a 48-hour term of incarceration.  Roberts was never told that his refusal to take the test could also result in a mandatory two-day jail sentence if he were to be convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol.  Thus, Roberts was not informed of \"the consequences\" of failing to comply with the \"implied consent\" procedure.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Following Officer Main's reading of the \"implied consent\" form, Roberts asked to call his attorney before deciding whether or not to take the blood/alcohol test.  Officer Main denied this request, despite the apparent absence of any inconvenience or unreasonable delay in allowing the phone call.  If allowed to speak with his attorney, Roberts could have been informed of the sentencing consequences of a decision not to submit to the blood/alcohol test, thus clarifying the misleading information provided by Maine's \"implied consent\" form.  The attorney could have also provided advice to Roberts at the only point during the process for determining Roberts' sentence when the mandatory consequences of the two-day term of incarceration could still be avoided.  The attorney's advice would come too late at the sentencing hearing itself, at which time there is nothing the attorney can do to mitigate or rebut the imposition of the 48-hour jail term.  Roberts thus had to make a decision with irrevocable consequences for his sentence after the state provided him with inaccurate information with which he was expected to make that decision.  Under this combination of circumstances, it is incumbent upon the state to honor a reasonable request to call an attorney.  Refusing to provide this simple safeguard violated Roberts' right to due process.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A review of the Mathews factors confirms our conclusion.  The liberty interest deprived by the state's actions in this case is Roberts' freedom from the mandatory two-day jail sentence imposed because of the refusal to take a blood/alcohol test.  Roberts' interest in freedom from incarceration is certainly worthy of substantial due process protections.  See, e.g., United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 2103, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987);  Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 423-25, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1807-09, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979).  In addition, Maine placed Roberts in a position where he was forced to make a decision between cooperating with investigators and suffering mandatory and irrevocable consequences for his subsequent sentencing.  Cooperation in this case would probably have sealed Roberts' fate at trial but it also would have avoided certain harsher penalties.  Roberts thus faced a situation similar in some respects to plea bargaining.  As such, Maine's \"implied consent\" procedure implicates Roberts' right to receive fair treatment by the prosecution during plea bargaining.  Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 261-62, 92 S.Ct. 495, 498-99, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971);  Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 756-58, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1473-74, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970);  United States v. Bouthot, 878 F.2d 1506, 1511 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the mandatory sentencing consequences stemming from Roberts' refusal to take the blood/alcohol test injects important elements of sentencing procedure into the police investigation of a suspected OUI offense.  Because Roberts can do nothing to contest the imposition of a 48-hour term of incarceration at the sentencing hearing itself, the critical point for calculating a key portion of Roberts' sentence essentially occurs at the time Roberts is requested to take the blood/alcohol test.  Thus, this case implicates Roberts' interest in fair sentencing procedures.  Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1204-05, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977);  United States v. Doe, 655 F.2d 920, 927-28 (9th Cir.1980).  We find, therefore, that Maine's actions towards Roberts implicate important liberty interests deserving of substantial due process protection.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the second consideration under Mathews, the risk of erroneous deprivation of the liberty interest and the probable value of an additional procedural safeguard, we find a strong due process justification for allowing Roberts to contact his attorney.  Although Officer Main's refusal to allow Roberts to call his attorney did not significantly increase the risk that Roberts would be erroneously convicted of an OUI offense, the officer's conduct greatly increased the risk that a two-day jail sentence would be imposed on Roberts as a result of a decision made in reliance upon misleading information.  The erroneous deprivation thus consists of attaching sentencing consequences to a choice that an individual may not have made had the state provided him or her with accurate information.  In other words, absent the inaccurate information, the two-day jail term may not have been imposed.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We are faced here with a unique situation in which the sentencing consequences of incarceration are imposed not so much for the substantive criminal conduct itself but for the separate volitional act of refusing to cooperate with the investigation of that conduct.  As such, an erroneous deprivation of liberty can result from a suspect's behavior under rather dubious circumstances, if not false pretenses, created by the state.  In this case, Roberts might have chosen to cooperate and thus avoid the mandatory term of incarceration if he had been allowed to speak with his lawyer and correct the inaccurate information he received.  Once Roberts' decision was made, however, there was nothing the attorney or judge could do at sentencing to remedy Roberts' tainted decision.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">On the other side of the coin, there is much that allowing Roberts to call his attorney could do to safeguard against the type of erroneous deprivation of liberty at risk in this case.  Plainly and simply, Roberts' attorney could have informed Roberts of the additional sentencing consequences of refusing to take the blood/alcohol test, thus correcting the state's misleading information.  The attorney could also counsel Roberts on the advisability of cooperating to avoid the mandatory two-day sentence.  This is the only point at which such counsel has any value;  once the decision whether or not to submit to the test is made, the die is cast, and nothing the attorney can do at sentencing will mitigate the effect of the two-day sentence.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The present situation thus presents concerns analogous to those expressed by the Supreme Court in many of its right to counsel cases.  See Wade, 388 U.S. at 224, 87 S.Ct. at 1931 (affording right to counsel at critical pre-trial stages of proceedings \"where the results might well settle the accused's fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality\");  Ash, 413 U.S. at 315-16, 93 S.Ct. at 2576 (noting that \"there were times when the subsequent trial would cure a one-sided confrontation between prosecuting authorities and the uncounseled defendant,\" rendering the absence of an attorney acceptable, but that there were other times when an attorney was required because there was no such \"opportunity to cure defects at trial\");  Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 170, 106 S.Ct. 477, 484, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985);  see also Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 133, 88 S.Ct. 254, 256, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967) (reviewing holding in Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948), where the absence of counsel during sentencing combined with false assumptions about the defendant's criminal record was found to deprive the defendant of due process, and noting that the counsel in that case \" 'might not have changed the sentence, but he could have taken steps to see that the conviction and sentence were not predicated on misinformation or misreading of court records, a requirement of fair play which absence of counsel withheld from this prisoner.' \")  (quoting Townsend, 334 U.S. at 741, 68 S.Ct. at 1255).   We therefore conclude that Maine's implied consent procedure presents a substantial risk of erroneous deprivation of liberty and that allowing Roberts to call his attorney is likely to alleviate the risk and, as such, is a valuable procedural safeguard.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we consider the state's interest in refusing to allow Roberts to call his attorney, including any administrative and fiscal burdens such a phone call would entail.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that allowing Roberts to call his lawyer from the police station would impose on the police any meaningful burden whatsoever.  On the contrary, Maine law allows for suspected drunk drivers to request their own physician to conduct the blood/alcohol test if reasonably available.  29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312.  Maine thus already contemplates making reasonable accommodations for drunk driving suspects.  Allowing a simple phone call to an attorney is much less intrusive on the implied consent process than arranging a medical procedure with the suspect's doctor.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Given the transient nature of the evidence in drunk driving cases--that is, the blood/alcohol level in a suspect's blood--the police may certainly proceed with the implied consent procedure if a delay would affect the test results or otherwise interfere with the testing procedure.  The police may refuse to wait for a suspect who is unable to reach an attorney within a reasonable period of time or refuse to undertake time-consuming and burdensome efforts to contact an attorney who is not immediately available.  There is no indication, however, that such was the case here.  Officer Main testified that he did not allow Roberts to call his attorney because Roberts was uncooperative and shouting obscenities.  We see no relevance of this fact to any state interest in refusing to allow Roberts to make a phone call before deciding whether or not to take the blood/alcohol test.  We therefore find no significant state interest in refusing to allow Roberts to call his attorney that would justify what we consider to be a denial of due process.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">To clarify, we do not discount Maine's interest in imposing an implied consent procedure to encourage the voluntary testing of drunk drivers, nor do we have any quarrel with Maine's desire to impose harsher penalties on those refusing to cooperate.  We see very little interest, however, in denying a reasonable request at the police station to call an attorney, where that call could serve to clear up misleading information regarding the testing procedure provided by the state.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we do not find, in this case at least, that a suspected drunk driver has a due process right to contact an attorney whenever the state imposes mandatory sentencing consequences upon the refusal of the suspect to take a blood/alcohol test.  Rather, we find that where the suspect makes a reasonable request to contact his or her attorney and the attorney can correct misleading information provided by the state at a point when the suspect must make a decision that is crucial for his or her subsequent sentencing, due process requires that the suspect's request be honored.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We are confronted with a substantially different situation in this case than the one that the Supreme Court considered in South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553, 103 S.Ct. 916, 74 L.Ed.2d 748 (1983).  In Neville, the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause was not violated when a police officer failed to warn a suspected drunk driver that his refusal to submit to a blood-alcohol test could be used against him at trial.  The Court reasoned that because the drunk driver in that case was specifically warned that his refusal to submit to the test would result in the suspension of his license, the driver knew that his refusal \"was not a 'safe harbor,' free of adverse consequences.\"  Id. at 566, 103 S.Ct. at 924.   The Court also noted that it was \"unrealistic to say that the warnings given here implicitly assure a suspect that no consequences other than those mentioned will occur.\"  Id.<sup>2</sup></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Unlike Neville, the present case is not a simple \"failure to warn\" situation involving a state's withholding of information that it was never required to provide.  Rather, this is a case in which a mandatory sentence of incarceration is attached to a suspect's decision to take a blood/alcohol test, where the suspect is given misleading information that indicates no such sentence exists;  and further, where that suspect is denied permission to speak to an attorney who could have cleared up the misunderstanding and who could have provided advice at the only point where the sentencing consequences could be avoided.  The Supreme Court did not address the due process implications of these circumstances.  Instead, Neville dealt with a quite different issue:  the due process implications of a state's failure to warn about the use at trial of a suspect's refusal to take a blood/alcohol test.  The differences between the two cases are stark.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">First, Neville considered an interest of much lower magnitude than Roberts' liberty interest in freedom from incarceration.  As the Supreme Court found, the use of the fact that a suspect refused to submit to a test as evidence against that suspect at trial does not implicate the suspect's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  Id. at 558-64, 103 S.Ct. at 919-23.   Thus, the suspect in Neville had no protectable liberty interest beyond the general right to a fair trial, a right which faced little risk of erroneous deprivation in that case.  Neville did not involve a mandatory sentence that risked depriving an individual of the important liberty interest of freedom from incarceration, a liberty interest that is involved here.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, the consequence about which Maine failed to warn Roberts in the present case is irrevocable and irrebuttable, making the suggested procedural safeguard--permission to call an attorney--crucial to protecting Roberts' liberty interest.  In the Neville case, however, the consequences involved an evidentiary disadvantage that could be rebutted, mitigated or otherwise explained by counsel at trial.  The blood/alcohol test, therefore, was not the only point in Neville at which a procedural safeguard would have had any value.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Third, there is an additional element of unfairness in this case, not found in Neville, due to the misleading nature of the instructions given to Roberts.  In the Neville case, the Supreme Court specifically noted that the suspect was given no implicit assurances that he was being warned of all the consequences of refusing to submit to testing, id. at 566, 103 S.Ct. at 924, whereas in this case, Roberts was told that he had been advised of \"the consequences,\" incorrectly implying that there were no additional consequences.  As a result, Roberts faced a greater risk of erroneous deprivation of his liberty than the suspect in Neville.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Due process may not require warnings of the consequences of refusing to take a blood/alcohol test, and it may not require a full right to counsel for suspects facing the decision whether or not to submit to testing.  Under the circumstances of this case, however, as a matter of fair play and decency, due process does require that Roberts be given a reasonable opportunity to call his attorney before deciding on whether to be tested.</p>\n        <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the mandatory 48-hour jail sentence imposed on Roberts pursuant to Sec. 1312-B(2)(B)(4) violates due process.  The infirmities in the procedures surrounding Roberts' arrest did not, however, taint his underlying convictions for drunk driving and driving with a suspended license.  Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to issue a writ of habeas corpus upon the failure of the State of Maine to vacate the mandatory 48-hour jail sentence imposed pursuant to Sec. 1312-B(2)(B)(4) and to accord Roberts a sentencing hearing at which no minimum sentence is mandated.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">CYR, Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Although I am pleased to concur in the result reached in the ably crafted majority opinion, I write separately on the due process claim.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court (\"Law Court\"), citing State v. Plante, 417 A.2d 991, 994 (1980) (pre-Neville ), erroneously concluded that \"the right to a warning of the consequences of refusing a chemical test is not one of constitutional dimensions.\"  State v. Roberts, 609 A.2d 702, 703 (Me.1992).<sup>3</sup>  The district court below likewise erred in ruling that a \"requirement that a driver submit to a chemical test does not implicate the due process clause of the Constitution,\" Roberts v. Maine, No. 93-0154-B, slip op. at 3 (D.Me. Sept. 24, 1993) (magistrate-judge's proposed findings and recommendation), aff'd, slip op. at 1 (D.Me. Oct. 27, 1993) (emphasis added).  Consequently, neither court reached Roberts' due process claim.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Law Court premised its conclusion in large part on South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553, 103 S.Ct. 916, 74 L.Ed.2d 748 (1983).  See Roberts, 609 A.2d at 703 (\"the [Neville] Court reasoned that allowing the suspect to choose whether to submit to testing is 'a matter of legislative grace' bestowed by the state legislature and thus, not subject to constitutional protections.\").  However, the statement relied on by the Law Court related to Neville's Fifth Amendment self-incrimination claim, not the due process claim.  See infra at p. 1297.  The Neville Court explicitly qualified its statement so as to obviate any intimation that penalties for refusing to submit to chemical testing are beyond the scope of the Due Process Clause.  Neville, 459 U.S. at 560, 103 S.Ct. at 920 (\"Such penalty for refusing to take a blood-alcohol test is unquestionably legitimate, assuming appropriate procedural safeguards.\")  (emphasis added).<sup>4</sup></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional underpinnings for the more recent Supreme Court pronouncements on \"implied consent\" procedures stem from Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966).  See Nyflot v. Minnesota Comm'r of Pub. Safety, 474 U.S. 1027, 1027-29, 106 S.Ct. 586, 586-88, 88 L.Ed.2d 567 (1984) (summary dismissal for want of substantial federal question) (opinion of White, J., dissenting from summary dismissal);  Neville, 459 U.S. 553, 103 S.Ct. 916;  see also Mackey v. Montrym, 443 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2612, 61 L.Ed.2d 321 (1979);  Dixon v. Love, 431 U.S. 105, 97 S.Ct. 1723, 52 L.Ed.2d 172 (1977);  Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 1589, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971);  Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432, 77 S.Ct. 408, 1 L.Ed.2d 448 (1957).  Schmerber held the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination inapplicable because blood-alcohol level testing (\"chemical testing\"), albeit a Fourth Amendment search and seizure, simply yields real or physical evidence as distinguished from \"testimonial\" evidence.  Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 765, 86 S.Ct. at 1832-33.   Accordingly, the State may force a nonconsenting suspect to submit to a reasonable chemical test under exigent circumstances, without a warrant, provided there is probable cause to arrest the suspect for \"operating under the influence\" (\"OUI\").  Id. at 766-72, 86 S.Ct. at 1833-37.   And since alcohol and drugs are evanescent substances inexorably metabolized by the body, the \"exigent circumstances\" requirement is almost invariably met by the urgent need to test before a warrant can be obtained.  Id. at 770-71, 86 S.Ct. at 1835-36.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Years later, in Neville, the Supreme Court rejected two distinct constitutional challenges to an \"implied consent\" statute which empowered South Dakota to introduce into evidence an OUI suspect's refusal to submit to chemical testing.  First, the Court held that the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was never implicated because the State did not impermissibly coerce the refusal.  Neville, 459 U.S. at 562-64, 103 S.Ct. at 921-23.   Second, and more to the present point, the Court rejected Neville's substantive due process claim premised on Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976).  Neville, 459 U.S. at 564-66, 103 S.Ct. at 922-24.   Even though Neville was not warned that his refusal to submit to chemical testing could be offered against him at trial, and notwithstanding the fact that the police had advised him that his silence could not be used against him, see Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 467-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624-27, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the Supreme Court nevertheless found no \"misleading implicit assurances\" that the refusal to be tested would not be introduced in evidence, since \"the warning that [Neville] could lose his driver's license made it clear that refusing the test was not a 'safe harbor,' free of adverse consequences.\"  Neville, 459 U.S. at 565-66, 103 S.Ct. at 923-24.  Neville thus upheld the power of the State to penalize refusals to submit to chemical testing, but explicitly conditioned its exercise on the availability of \"appropriate procedural protections.\"  Id.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The procedural due process analysis appropriate to the present context contrasts starkly with the substantive due process analysis in Neville, where the only unwarned adverse consequence was that the State ultimately might be allowed to request the trier of fact, at trial, to infer that the refusal to be tested constituted evidence of his consciousness of guilt (intoxication).  See S.D.Codified Laws Sec. 32-23-10.1.  (1980) (\"such refusal may be admissible\" in evidence at trial.)   In such a setting, a defendant would be afforded the full panoply of procedural protections available at trial.   First, the State's evidentiary proffer of the refusal to be tested would be subject to objection by the defendant;  for example, on grounds that it did not evince the suspect's consciousness of guilt but mere confusion as to his legal rights.  See Fed.R.Evid. 401, 403.  Second, if the refusal were admitted in evidence, the defendant would be allowed to introduce evidence to rebut any \"consciousness of guilt\" inference.  Finally, the trier of fact would be permitted, and could not be required, see Carella v. California, 491 U.S. 263, 265, 109 S.Ct. 2419, 2420, 105 L.Ed.2d 218 (1989) (per curiam);  Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 514, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 2454, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979), to infer \"consciousness of guilt,\" but only to consider it, along with all other evidence, in determining whether the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Thus, in Neville, no unwarned consequence flowed inexorably from the refusal to be tested.  All conventional trial procedures for barring and rebutting the refusal evidence remained available, including the right to defend against it on the issue of guilt.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, no meaningful procedure remained for Roberts to defend against the term of confinement mandated upon conviction for OUI as a consequence of the unwarned refusal to be tested.  See Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 133-34, 88 S.Ct. 254, 256-57, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967) (sentencing is critical stage in criminal process);  see also Palmer v. City of Euclid, 402 U.S. 544, 546, 91 S.Ct. 1563, 1564-65, 29 L.Ed.2d 98 (1971) (per curiam);  cf. Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 137-39, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 2187, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (even where sentencing court is vested with explicit sentencing discretion, sua sponte upward departure--absent prior notice to defendant--raises serious due process concerns).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Under the Maine \"implied consent\" procedure, see 29 M.R.S.A. Secs. 1312, 1312-B (Supp.1994) (collectively:  \"section 1312\"), the suspect is never warned that refusal to be tested entails a mandatory minimum sentence upon conviction for OUI.  No matter how compelling or innocent the suspect's reason for refusing to be tested, see, e.g., Jamros v. Jensen, 221 Neb. 426, 377 N.W.2d 119, 123 (1985), the sentencing court must impose a minimum term of confinement, without regard to whether either the trier of fact or the sentencing judge ascribes the slightest \"consciousness of guilt\" to the suspect's refusal to be tested.  Thus, in due process terms Maine's standard \"implied consent\" procedure differs essentially from the process upheld in Neville, particularly with respect to the absence of adequate predeprivation notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.  See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1493, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The State need not acquiesce in an OUI suspect's refusal to submit to testing under an \"implied consent\" statute.  Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770-71, 86 S.Ct. at 1835-36.   But once it opts to allow suspects to refuse chemical testing, it may not disregard procedural due process constraints under the Fourteenth Amendment by depriving suspects of their protected liberty interest in remaining free from incarceration, without affording either adequate predeprivation notice or meaningful postdeprivation process.  See Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 541, 105 S.Ct. at 1493 (\"While the legislature may elect not to confer [an interest], it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest, once conferred, without appropriate procedural safeguards.\")</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion in the present case essentially relies on a Doyle-based substantive due process analysis, see Doyle, 426 U.S. at 617-19, 96 S.Ct. at 2244-45, in concluding that it was fundamentally unfair for the State of Maine to subject Roberts to an unwarned mandatory minimum term of confinement for refusing to be tested.  See supra pp. 1291-92.  Although I am in substantial agreement with its substantive due process analysis, particularly that the warnings given Roberts included seriously \"misleading implicit assurances\"--a subject neither reached by the Law Court nor discussed by the district court--it is less clear to me that a substantive due process analysis is appropriate following Albright v. Oliver, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Even though the Fourteenth Amendment affords both substantive and procedural due process protections, the Supreme Court cautioned in Albright that \"where a particular amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due process must be the guide for analyzing these claims.\"  Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 813.   In the present context, therefore, Albright appears to require at least initial resort to the procedural due process jurisprudence having particular application to similar proceedings.  See Mackey, 443 U.S. at 10-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2617-22 (applying procedural due process analysis to license suspension for refusal to submit to chemical testing).<sup>5</sup></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The cornerstone regimen for identifying the particular process appropriate to deprivations of life, liberty or property is limned in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).</p>\n        <p>Identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors:  First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action;  second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards;  and finally, the government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Under section 1312-B(2)(B)(4) (1987), a person convicted as a first-time OUI offender must serve not less than a two-day term of confinement if he refused to submit to chemical testing.  Maine alone mandates a minimum term of confinement upon conviction for OUI after failing to submit to chemical testing, yet inexplicably withholds from its standard \"implied consent\" advisory any mention of the mandatory minimum term of confinement attending the refusal to submit.  See supra p. 1289.<sup>6</sup></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The standard advisory contemplates that the police provide two explicit warnings before requesting an OUI suspect to submit to chemical testing.  First, the suspect is to be informed that refusal to be tested will result in an administrative suspension of motor vehicle operating privileges for not less than six months nor more than three years.  Id. Sec. 1312(1) (first offense).  Second, the police \"should also inform the [suspect] that the failure to comply with the duty to submit to a chemical test is admissible in evidence\" at a subsequent OUI trial.  Id.  Although a failure so to inform the suspect does not render any chemical-test result inadmissible, see id., no sanction omitted from the standard advisory can be imposed upon the accused, except the mandatory minimum sentence at issue in this appeal.  See id. Sec. 1312(1), (2), (8).<sup>7</sup></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Among the other forty-nine states, only four impose any nonadministrative sanction for refusing chemical testing.  Two states, New York and New Jersey, prescribe mandatory minimum civil fines following an adjudication in a separate proceeding, based on an independent showing that the suspect failed to submit to chemical testing.  See N.Y.Veh. &amp; Traf.Law Sec. 1194(2)(c) (1994) (separate administrative proceeding);  N.J.Stat.Ann. Sec. 39:4-50.4a (1994) (separate judicial proceeding).  See also State v. DiSomma, 262 N.J.Super. 375, 621 A.2d 55 (App.Div.1993).<sup>8</sup>  Three states, Alaska, Minnesota and Nebraska, have made it a separate criminal offense to refuse to submit to chemical testing, but only if the suspect was so informed at the time the request to submit was made.  See Ak.Stat.Ann. Sec. 28.35.032(a) (1994) (\"after being advised ... that the refusal is a crime\");  Minn.Stat. Sec. 169.123(b) (1994) (\"At the time the test is requested, the person shall be informed ... that refusal to take a test is a crime.);   Neb.Rev.Stat. Sec. 60-6,197(10) (1993) (\"Any person who is required to submit to a ... chemical blood test ... shall be advised of (a) the consequences of refusing to submit to such test or tests....\");  see also Jamros, 377 N.W.2d at 123 (holding that defendant cannot be convicted unless forewarned that refusal to submit is separate crime).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In sum, then, section 1312, unlike the \"implied consent\" procedure in any other state, neither criminalizes the refusal to submit to chemical testing nor contemplates that the suspect be forewarned that a criminal penalty, let alone a mandatory minimum term of confinement, may attend the refusal.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Absent adequate notice that particular conduct has been criminalized, a person may not be convicted or punished for it.  See Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 361-63, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1706-08, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964) (failure to afford notice that statute criminalized particular activity);  Wright v. Georgia, 373 U.S. 284, 293, 83 S.Ct. 1240, 1246, 10 L.Ed.2d 349 (1963) (same);  Lambert v. California, 355 U.S. 225, 227, 78 S.Ct. 240, 242, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (1957) (\"Notice is required before property interests are disturbed, before assessments are made, before penalties are assessed.\").  As a general rule, of course, publication of a criminal statute affords adequate notice to the public at large.  Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 199, 111 S.Ct. 604, 609, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991) (\"Based on the notion that the law is definite and knowable, the common law presumed that every person knew the law.\").  And, of course, the common-law rule--that every person is presumed to know the law--not only applies in criminal cases, United States v. International Mins. &amp; Chem.  Corp., 402 U.S. 558, 563, 91 S.Ct. 1697, 1700-01, 29 L.Ed.2d 178 (1970), but has prompted little concern in the usual course.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The common-law rule would be perverted, however, were it used to shield from constitutional challenge a deceptive State advisory that is delivered directly to the individual suspect and implicitly undermines any constructive notice presumptively afforded by publication.  See Raley v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 423, 438-39, 79 S.Ct. 1257, 1266-67, 3 L.Ed.2d 1344 (1959);  see also Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 875 n. 3, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3169 n. 3, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987) (citing Lambert, 355 U.S. at 228, 78 S.Ct. at 242) (\"If the regulation in question established a standard of conduct to which the probationer had to conform on pain of penalty--e.g. a restriction on his movements--the state court could not constitutionally adopt so unnatural an interpretation of the language that the regulation would fail to provide adequate notice.\")  (emphasis added).  Accordingly, in my view, constructive notice by publication cannot insulate from procedural due process challenge the deceptive assurances the standard \"implied consent\" form instructs the police to communicate directly to the suspect immediately prior to the decision to refuse to submit to chemical testing.  See Raley, 360 U.S. at 438-39, 79 S.Ct. at 1266-67.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court made clear in Neville, 459 U.S. at 566, 103 S.Ct. at 924, that courts should be realistic in their assessment of the context in which the allegedly misleading assurances are communicated to the suspect.  It would be unrealistic in the extreme to suggest that a suspect in custody, whose only actual knowledge comes directly from the police in the form prescribed by law, nonetheless must be deemed on notice that the police advisory incorrectly states the actual consequences of refusing to be tested.<sup>9</sup>  See Raley, 360 U.S. at 438-39, 79 S.Ct. at 1266-67 (Although the Commission gave erroneous advice to the witnesses, \"the fact remains that at the inquiry [it was] the voice of the State most presently speaking to the appellants.\")  (emphasis added);  see also supra notes 8 &amp; 9.  Implicit in any such unrealistic assessment is the premise that a suspect in custody--denied access to counsel and totally dependent upon the State for the integrity of the implied consent advisory--should be presumed to have had not merely constructive notice, but the requisite actual knowledge of the procedural provisions of the \"implied consent\" statute that alone might alert him, but see infra note 13, to the criminal sanction attendant to a refusal to submit to testing.  See supra note 5.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The standard \"implied consent\" advisory, naturally interpreted, see Griffin, 483 U.S. at 875, n. 3, 107 S.Ct. at 3169, n. 3, realistically and in context, see Neville, 459 U.S. at 566, 103 S.Ct. at 924, undermines whatever constructive notice might normally be presumed from mere publication of section 1312.  See Raley, 360 U.S. at 438-39, 79 S.Ct. at 1266-67.<sup>10</sup>  The Court in Raley concluded that certain witnesses had been convicted without due process \"for exercising a privilege which the State clearly had told [them] was available....\"  Id. at 438, 79 S.Ct. at 1266 (emphasis added).  The Court even reversed the conviction of another witness, Brown, who was never advised that a privilege existed, but whose attempts to assert privilege had been facilitated by the Commission.<sup>11</sup>  Id. at 430, 79 S.Ct. at 1262.   See Neville, 459 U.S. at 566, 103 S.Ct. at 924 (leaving open the possibility that the State might \"unfairly trick\" a person with an \"implicit promise\");  cf. Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 571, 85 S.Ct. 476, 484, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965) (vacating convictions, as violative of procedural due process, on grounds that defendants had been advised by police officials that picketing was permitted at the arrest site).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the standard \"implied consent\" advisory challenged by Roberts conveys not merely a \"mixed message,\" see United States v. Smith, 940 F.2d 710, 715 (1st Cir.1991), but one likely to befuddle a Philadelphia lawyer.  While it requires the police to advise the suspect that he has the duty to submit to testing, it also requires that the suspect be told that he may elect not to submit to testing, subject only to certain administrative and evidentiary consequences.  Although it is conceivable that \"lesser included\" sanctions for refusing testing might be encompassed within Neville's \"no safe harbor\" rationale, see Neville, 459 U.S. at 565-66, 103 S.Ct. at 923-24, Maine's standard advisory could only be salvaged on the counterintuitive theory that notice of the lesser sanction should be deemed to encompass the greater--both in terms of severity and constitutional dimension--thereby abandoning the central constitutional concern for meaningful process.  See Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 551, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965) (due process clause envisions that the process due be accorded \"at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner\");  Raley, 360 U.S. at 438, 79 S.Ct. at 1266;  cf. United States v. Cardiff, 344 U.S. 174, 176-77, 73 S.Ct. 189, 190, 97 L.Ed. 200 (1952) (\"We cannot sanction taking a man by the heels for refusing to grant the permission which this Act on its face apparently gave him the right to withhold.  That would be making an act criminal without fair and effective notice.\")  (overturning criminal conviction for refusing admittance to government inspector in reliance on regulatory provision that appeared to confer right to refuse).<sup>12</sup></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Although the standard \"implied consent\" advisories on the administrative (license suspension) and evidentiary (admission of test refusal) sanctions for refusing testing afford fair notice that refusal is \"not a safe harbor\", Neville, 459 U.S. at 566, 103 S.Ct. at 924, Neville does not insulate from constitutional challenge state-prescribed advisories that actively instigate the natural and realistic interpretation that no sanction more serious than the warned sanctions will attach to the suspect's refusal to submit to testing.<sup>13</sup>  See, e.g., Raley, 360 U.S. at 425, 79 S.Ct. at 1259-60.   Furthermore, by instructing the police to bait the \"no-test\" option with the implicit assurance that \"the consequences\" for refusing chemical testing are noncriminal in nature, see supra p. 1299, the standard advisory seems well suited to snare even the most wary suspect.  After all, rarely in the experience of courts, let alone ordinary citizens, are law enforcement officers cast as exclusive advisors to custodial suspects concerning a state-tendered option not to perform an implied duty, and then instructed to warn individual suspects of the noncriminal sanctions for abjuring their duty, without mentioning the criminal consequences.   Under no natural interpretation of the standard advisory is it fair to say that a suspect is afforded meaningful pre-refusal notice of the mandatory minimum sentence.<sup>14</sup>  See Raley, 360 U.S. at 438-39, 79 S.Ct. at 1266-67;  cf. Reich v. Collins, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 547, 550-51, 130 L.Ed.2d 454 (1994) (denial of procedural due process results where statute, naturally read, allowed citizen choice between predeprivation or postdeprivation challenge to tax assessment, but state supreme court disallowed postdeprivation review after citizen had elected to prepay tax assessment).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A coordinate procedural safeguard under the Due Process Clause dictates that any opportunity to be heard shall be provided \"at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\"  Armstrong, 380 U.S. at 552, 85 S.Ct. at 1191.   As there is no meaningful post-refusal opportunity to be heard on the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence under section 1312, and no suggestion that the state sentencing court contemplated a two-day term of confinement irrespective of the mandated minimum imposed pursuant to section 1312-B(2)(B)(4), I can only conclude that the process accorded Roberts violated fundamental notions of procedural due process.<sup>15</sup></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the analyses contemplated by the Supreme Court in Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903, clearly indicate that all appropriate process can be accorded under section 1312 simply by adding a few words to the standard \"implied consent\" advisory.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(i) The Private Interest</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The core liberty interest Roberts asserts in remaining free from incarceration is entitled to full procedural due process protection.  See Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 571-72, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2706-07, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972);  Bouie, 378 U.S. at 362, 84 S.Ct. at 1707 (overturning criminal conviction obtained through procedural due process violation);  Wright, 373 U.S. at 287, 83 S.Ct. at 1242-43 (same).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(ii) The Risk of Erroneous Deprivation</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The risk that an erroneous deprivation of liberty will occur is roughly commensurate with the relevance the unwarned consequence bears to the decision to refuse testing.  The unwarned mandatory term of confinement--the most serious consequence--surely bears great relevance to the \"no-test\" decision;  even a presumptively determinative relevance in the present circumstances.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Significant derivative risks attach to the inaccurate advisory as well.  No doubt there are many first-time OUI suspects with neither the knowledge nor the experience to assess whether their blood-alcohol content exceeds the prima facie intoxication level prescribed by statute.  For such suspects, at least, it cannot be claimed that an accurate advisory on the mandatory minimum term of confinement attendant upon a refusal to submit to testing would not materially influence their decision.  Thus, the deceptive \"implied consent\" advisory not only risks erroneous conviction (e.g., as a consequence of allowing an unwarned refusal in evidence where chemical testing may have revealed a blood-alcohol content below the prima facie level) but a sentence more severe than would have been imposed by the court but for the suspect's unwarned refusal to be tested (e.g., where reliable test results would have disclosed a blood-alcohol content below the prima facie intoxication level).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The undeniable value of a ready alternative to the deceptive advisory is obvious.  The legitimate interests of the State, as well as the accused, would be significantly advanced by the simple inclusion of a straightforward warning that a first-time refusal to submit to chemical testing must be followed by a minimum term of confinement upon conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  The State would advance its prospects for obtaining the most reliable evidence of intoxication--the suspect's blood-alcohol level, see Mackey, 443 U.S. at 19, 99 S.Ct. at 2621 (characterizing \"chemical test\" results as \"the most reliable form of evidence of intoxication for use in subsequent proceedings.\")--while the suspect in custody would receive full, fair, and timely notice of the relevant options and their consequences.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(iii) Governmental Interests</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the governmental interests at stake, and the administrative and fiscal burdens attendant to any additional procedural safeguard, must be considered.  See Mathews, 424 U.S. at 347-48, 96 S.Ct. at 908-09.   Although the police power is among the least limitable, Lambert, 355 U.S. at 228, 78 S.Ct. at 242-43, the State of Maine points to no governmental interest in omitting mention of the mandatory minimum sentence in its standard advisory.  Indeed, it is difficult to posit a legitimate governmental interest served by implicitly misleading OUI suspects into refusing to be tested.  Rather, the State's legitimate interest in obtaining the most reliable evidence of intoxication, through the voluntary cooperation of OUI suspects, is better served by advising the suspect of all sanctions for refusing testing.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The State has a paramount interest in minimizing any pre-testing delay which might render chemical-test results unreliable.  See Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770-71, 86 S.Ct. at 1835-36.   In all likelihood, however, a simple, straightforward amendment to the standard advisory would expedite chemical testing;  certainly, it would not delay it.<sup>16</sup>  And the effort to eradicate the tragic consequences of drunken driving on Maine highways would be advanced thereby, rather than hindered.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The ease with which an alternative procedure can be implemented likewise weighs heavily in favor of an amendment to the standard advisory, see Mathews, 424 U.S. at 348, 96 S.Ct. at 909 (\"At some point the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual ... may be outweighed by the cost.\"), especially since it would occasion neither pre-testing delay nor significant expense.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">As the mandatory minimum sentence was imposed in violation of the Due Process Clause, I agree that the writ should enter in the event the State of Maine does not vacate the mandatory minimum sentence and afford petitioner a meaningful sentencing hearing at which section 1312-B(2)(B)(4) is not applied.</p>\n        <p>1 The court also imposed a 90-day license suspension and a fine for Roberts' conviction of the substantive offenses of drunk driving and driving with a suspended license.</p>\n        <p>2 The instructions given to the defendant in Neville contained no language resembling the misleading statement in this case that the suspect had been \"advised of the consequences.\"   The instructions in Neville merely informed the suspect that if he refused to take a blood/alcohol test, his license could be suspended.  The suspect was then merely asked:  \"Do you understand what I told you?\"  Neville, 459 U.S. at 555 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. at 918 n. 2.</p>\n        <p>3 Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254, we accord de novo review to state court rulings on federal constitutional issues, Wellman v. Maine, 962 F.2d 70, 72 (1st Cir.1992), as well as to mixed questions of fact and law, id.  (\"Federal court may give different weight to the facts as found by the state court and may reach a different conclusion in light of the legal standard\") (quoting Sumner v. Mata, 455 U.S. 591, 597, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 1306-07, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982)).  See also Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1492, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (\"minimum procedural requirements are a matter of federal law, they are not diminished by the fact that the State may have specified its own procedures that it may deem adequate for determining the preconditions to adverse official action.\").</p>\n        <p>4 Indeed, the Plante case itself, upon which the Law Court directly relied in Roberts, 609 A.2d at 703, involved a self-incrimination claim as well.  See Plante, 417 A.2d at 994.   Viewed in context, the statement that an OUI suspect's \"right to refuse\" testing is \"simply a matter of grace bestowed by the ... Legislature,\" Neville, 459 U.S. at 565, 103 S.Ct. at 923, was meant merely to emphasize that the right to refuse testing, unlike the right to silence underlying Miranda warnings, is not of \"constitutional dimension.\"  Id.  Thus, Neville in no sense eroded the \"constitutional dimension\" inherent in the traditional procedural safeguards attending deprivations of protected liberty interests.  Id. at 560, 103 S.Ct. at 920-21.   See Mackey v. Montrym, 443 U.S. 1, 17-19, 99 S.Ct. 2612, 2620-22, 61 L.Ed.2d 321 (1979).</p>\n        <p>5 Were it otherwise, however, it should be noted that \"fundamental fairness\" was disserved in the instant case by the presence of an important factor specifically found absent in Neville, 459 U.S. at 563-64, 103 S.Ct. at 922-23.   That is, the Maine \"implied consent\" advisory, whether by design or inadvertence, assuredly has the effect of \"subtly coerc[ing] [suspects] into choosing the option [viz., refusal to be tested] that the State ha[s] no right to compel, rather than offering a true choice.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Cf. Roberts, 609 A.2d at 703 n. 1 (\"As in Neville, the warnings provided in this case were not designed to \"trick\" the defendant into refusing a test, then using the refusal against him at trial.\")  (emphasis added).  As the Supreme Court excepted such subtle coercion from the sweep of its ruling rejecting Neville's Fifth Amendment claim against self-incrimination, Neville, 459 U.S. at 566, 103 S.Ct. at 924, this factor too would weigh heavily against the Maine \"implied consent\" advisory under any substantive due process analysis which may remain open following Albright.   See Albright, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 114 S.Ct. at 820-21 (Souter, J., concurring) (due process clause affords protections not directly addressed by more particular constitutional provision).</p>\n        <p>Under either a procedural or substantive due process analysis, however, the State may not deprive a person of the core liberty interest in remaining free from incarceration, without affording either adequate advance notice or meaningful post-refusal process, by imposing a mandatory minimum term of confinement upon an unwarned suspect for electing to accept a state-tendered option to refuse chemical testing.  Cf. Burns, 501 U.S. at 137-39, 111 S.Ct. at 2187;  Neville, 459 U.S. at 563, 103 S.Ct. at 922 (noting that it is legitimate for the State to \"offer [the] option of refusing the test, with the attendant penalties for making that choice.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p>6 The police are required to read a standard advisory to the OUI suspect, see Roberts, 609 A.2d at 703, and no more, see id. at 704.   The Law Court concluded that it is \"without authority to expand the warning to encompass the full range of potential penalties,\" id., and we are bound by its interpretation of the Maine statute, see Ortiz v. Dubois, 19 F.3d 708, 713 n. 5 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 739, 130 L.Ed.2d 641 (1995).  Thus, the omission of the mandatory minimum sentence from the standard advisory plainly originates in section 1312.</p>\n        <p>7 Section 1312(1) states:</p>\n        <p>Before any test specified is given, the law enforcement officer shall inform the person as to whom there is probable cause that, if the person fails to comply with the duty to submit to and complete the required chemical tests at the direction of the law enforcement officer, that person's license ... will be suspended for a minimum of 6 months and may be as long as 3 years.  The officer should also inform the person that the failure to comply with the duty to submit to a chemical tests (sic) is admissible in evidence against that person at any trial for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.</p>\n        <p>No test results may be excluded as evidence in any proceeding before any administrative officer or court of this State as a result of the failure of the law enforcement officer to comply with this prerequisite.  The only effects of the failure of the officer to comply with this prerequisite are as provided in subsections 2 and 8.</p>\n        <p>Section 1312(2) states in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>Any suspension in effect shall be removed if, after hearing, it is determined that the person who failed to submit to the test would not have failed to submit but for the failure of the law enforcement officer to give either or both of the warnings required by subsection 1.</p>\n        <p>Section 1312(8) states in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>If the law enforcement officer ... fails to give either of the warnings required under subsection 1, the failure of the person to comply with the duty to submit to the chemical tests shall not be admissible, except when a test was required pursuant to subsection 11, paragraph D [testing after an accident involving death].</p>\n        <p>8 Under New Jersey law, the mandatory $250 civil fine is to be imposed following a separate judicial proceeding, but only if the suspect was so informed prior to refusing testing.  N.J.Stat.Ann. Sec. 39:4-50.2.  Under New York law, a mandatory minimum $250 fine is to be imposed, following a separate administrative proceeding, provided the suspect was forewarned that refusal to be tested may result in a license suspension.  N.Y.Veh. &amp; Traf.Law Sec. 1194(2)(c).</p>\n        <p>9 A compelling public interest normally warrants invoking the common-law presumption of constructive notice based on publication;  quite simply, there is no practicable alternative.  See International Mins. &amp; Chem.  Corp., 402 U.S. at 563, 91 S.Ct. at 1701 (\"The principle that ignorance of the law is no defense applies whether the law be a statute or a duly promulgated and published regulation.\")   But where the only purpose served by the presumption is to perpetuate a seriously flawed \"implied consent\" advisory that is inherently unfair to the suspect and counterproductive to any legitimate State interest, due process must be first served.  See infra pp. 1303-05.</p>\n        <p>10 In Raley, certain witnesses were advised by the Ohio Un-American Activities Commission, a creature of the Ohio Legislature, that they were entitled to assert a state-created privilege against self-incrimination.  Raley, 360 U.S. at 424-25, 79 S.Ct. at 1259-60.   The Commission advisory was inaccurate, however, as an Ohio statute conferred automatic transactional immunity upon witnesses in return for their testimony.  Id. at 431, 79 S.Ct. at 1263 (quoting Ohio Rev.Code Sec. 101.44).  After the witnesses were convicted of criminal contempt of the Ohio Legislature for refusing to answer questions put by its Commission, id. at 432, 79 S.Ct. at 1263, the United States Supreme Court set aside their convictions as violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id. at 437, 79 S.Ct. at 1265-66.</p>\n        <p>11 Significantly, the Commission permitted Brown to utilize a \"shorthand\" method for claiming privilege, id. 360 U.S. at 430-31, 79 S.Ct. at 1262 (\"the Chairman's concern [as to whether Brown was asserting privilege] is inexplicable on any other basis than that he deemed the privilege available at the inquiry, and his statements would tend to create such an impression in one appearing at the inquiry\"), without informing him that the claim was invalid, id. at 431-32, 79 S.Ct. at 1262-63.</p>\n        <p>12 The Law Court observed that Sec. 1312 was not designed to trick Roberts into refusing to be tested.  Roberts, 609 A.2d at 703 n. 1, (\"As in Neville, the warnings provided in [Roberts'] case were not designed to \"trick\" the defendant into refusing a test, then using the refusal against him at trial.\")   Supreme Court case law makes clear, however, that where an \"established state procedure\" deprives a person of a protected liberty interest without appropriate safeguards, a violation of procedural due process obtains.  See Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 436, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 1158, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982);  see also Raley, 360 U.S. at 438, 79 S.Ct. at 1266 (\"While there is no suggestion that the Commission had any intent to deceive the appellants, ... to sustain the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court on such a basis after the Commission had acted as it did would be to sanction the most indefensible sort of entrapment by the State--convicting a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State clearly had told him was available to him.\")</p>\n        <p>13 The standard \"implied consent\" advisory presents suspects with a deceptive choice in two vital respects.  First, the suspect is never informed of the most serious, unmitigable, and irremediable sanction for refusing to be tested.  Second, were the State to choose to force testing upon the suspect notwithstanding his refusal, it is far from clear that the \"option\" of refusal would avail the suspect anything other than a mandatory minimum sentence.  Compare Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 29, Sec. 1312 (1987) with Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 29, Sec. 1312(2) (Supp.1985-86).</p>\n        <p>Unlike the defendant in Smith, 940 F.2d at 715 (rejecting entrapment-by-estoppel claim), there is no suggestion that Roberts had any knowledge that the \"no-test\" option tendered by the arresting officer was punishable by a mandatory term of confinement.  The Smith court reasoned that an alleged \"mixed message\" from a police officer \"could not have reasonably invited [the defendant's] reliance ...\" because it was never claimed that the officer informed Smith that his conduct was lawful.  Id. at 715.   In the present case, however, reliance upon the deceptive advisory was plainly reasonable.  The alternative conclusion would be either that the information actually provided the suspect at the scene is immaterial, but see id., or that constructive notice of the statutory language trumps the knowledge actually acquired by the suspect from the police officer at the scene.  But see Raley, 360 U.S. at 438-39, 79 S.Ct. at 1266-67.</p>\n        <p>14 Moreover, under the rule of lenity, any ambiguity in the standard \"implied consent\" advisory must be resolved in favor of the accused.  See United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931, 952, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 2764, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988) (identifying purposes underlying rule of lenity as:  the promotion of fair notice \"to those subject to the criminal laws, minimiz[ing] the risk of selective or arbitrary enforcement, and ... maintain[ing] the proper balance between [the legislature], prosecutors and courts....\").</p>\n        <p>15 It is neither plausible to suggest, nor discernible from the record, that the mandatory minimum term of confinement was imposed simply as punishment for the underlying OUI offense.  First, the mandatory minimum sentence was not preordained by the OUI conviction but by the unwarned refusal to submit to testing in the moments following the arrest.  Although it is preconditioned on an OUI conviction, all meaningful discretion on the part of the sentencing court is withdrawn as an unwarned consequence of the defendant's noncriminal refusal to submit to testing.  Second, no mitigating circumstances, either in relation to the refusal to be tested or the commission of the underlying offense, can enable the court to sentence below the mandatory minimum.  Third, the statutory description of the mandatory minimum sentence for refusing testing--as an \"aggravating factor,\" see Sec. 1312-B(2) (\"refusal to submit to a chemical test shall in every case be an aggravating factor\")--is itself a misleading euphemism for what is in reality a conclusive sentencing mandate which the court is required not merely to consider but to impose without regard to any mitigating circumstance.</p>\n        <p>16 The majority opinion persuasively demonstrates that no Sixth Amendment right to counsel arose until well after Roberts refused to be tested.  But though I share the view that Roberts was not accorded the process due when confronted with the choice whether to submit to chemical testing, I am unable to agree with the court that he was entitled to the assistance of counsel at that time, as distinguished from appropriate notice of the consequences of refusing.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Secs. 1312, 1312-B.  Petitioner-Appellant Alan D. Roberts challenges the constitutionality of his conviction and sentence under this law because, prior to his decision not to take a blood/alcohol test, (1) a police officer informed Roberts of \"the consequences\" of refusing to take the test but did not mention the mandatory jail sentence, and (2) the police officer denied Roberts' request to call his attorney.  We find that under the particular circumstances of this case, Roberts' constitutional right to due process was violated and his petition for writ of habeas corpus must be granted as to his two-day mandatory sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1991, Officer Alan Main of the Waterville, Maine Police Department stopped Roberts after Officer Main observed Roberts driving erratically.  Officer Main smelled alcohol on Roberts' breath and suspected Roberts was driving while intoxicated but initially arrested Roberts only for operating a vehicle with a suspended license in violation of 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 2184.  Officer Main handcuffed Roberts and then transported him to the Waterville Police Station for processing.  Roberts remained in handcuffs throughout the relevant time period at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the police station, Officer Main read Maine's \"implied consent\" form to Roberts, which is normally read to any driver stopped or arrested for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor pursuant to 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312.  The form states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>By operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle in this State you have a duty to submit to and complete chemical tests to determine your blood-alcohol level and drug concentration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>I will give you a breath test unless I decide it is unreasonable, in which case another chemical test will be given.  If you are requested to take a blood test you may ask that your physician perform the test if your physician is reasonably available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>If you fail to comply with your duty to submit to and complete chemical tests your driver's license or permit or right to apply for or obtain a license will be suspended for at least 6 months and may be suspended as long as 3 years.  Your failure to submit to a chemical test is admissible against you at any trial for operating while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>I have been advised of the consequences of failure to comply with the duty to submit to and complete a chemical test at the request of an officer and DO NOT WISH TO SUBMIT TO A TEST.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Signature of Person Refusing Test</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Maine's implied consent form essentially tracks the language of the \"implied consent\" statute which requires officers to warn suspected drunk drivers of potential consequences of refusing to take the blood/alcohol test.  29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312.  As the statute was originally enacted, the only two consequences for failure to consent were, as the form states, suspension of the suspect's driver's license and the admission of the fact that the suspect refused to take the test in evidence at trial.  In 1987, however, the Maine legislature amended its statute to provide two additional consequences, both involving sentencing, for refusing to take a blood/alcohol test.  1987 Maine Laws, ch. 791.  Under the current law, a defendant's refusal to submit to the test is considered to be an \"aggravating factor\" for the determination of that defendant's sentence and, more significantly, that defendant's refusal will result in a mandatory minimum sentence of 48 hours incarceration upon conviction.  29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312-B(2) &amp; (2)(B)(4).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, these changes did not make their way into the portion of the statute mandating what the police must say to suspected drunk drivers after those drivers are stopped.  29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312(1).  As a result, the \"implied consent\" form was never changed to reflect the additional consequences for refusing to submit to a blood/alcohol test.  Likewise, during Roberts' processing at the police station, Officer Main never informed Roberts of the additional consequences, including the mandatory jail sentence.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">During the period when Officer Main was administering the \"implied consent\" procedure to Roberts, Roberts asked several times to use the telephone for the purpose of calling his attorney.  Officer Main refused to allow Roberts to do so.  Officer Main claimed that he denied Roberts permission to contact his attorney because Roberts was uncooperative and shouting obscenities.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Roberts eventually refused to take the blood/alcohol test.  He also refused to sign the \"implied consent\" form after the form was read to him.  Subsequently, the police filed a criminal complaint against Roberts charging him, among other things, with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor (\"OUI\") and operating on a suspended license in violation of 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312-B and 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 2184 respectively.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">After a trial in the Maine district court, Roberts was convicted on the OUI and operating on a suspended license charges.  At sentencing, the court followed the requirements of 29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312-B(2)(B)(4) and imposed the mandatory minimum 48-hour sentence of incarceration as a result of Roberts' refusal to take a blood/alcohol test.<sup>1</sup> Roberts appealed his conviction to the Kennebec County Superior Court and then to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.  Both appellate courts denied his appeal.  Following remand for the imposition of sentence, Roberts initiated a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Maine.  The Maine state trial court ordered the sentence of incarceration stayed pending the outcome of proceedings on the habeas corpus petition.  The federal district court dismissed Roberts' habeas corpus petition on October 29, 1993.  Roberts then brought this appeal.</p>\n        <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Roberts raises two related issues on appeal:  (1) whether Officer Main's refusal to allow Roberts to call his attorney before deciding whether to take a blood/alcohol test denied Roberts of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel;  and (2) whether Maine's \"implied consent\" form is misleading and inaccurate, in violation of Roberts' constitutional right to due process.  Although Roberts' Sixth Amendment right to counsel is not implicated in this case, we do find a violation of Roberts' due process rights on the grounds that all of the circumstances of the case, including, but not limited to, the misleading information, deprived Roberts of fundamental fairness.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A. Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that, \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to ... have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  VI.  It is axiomatic that the right to counsel attaches only upon \"the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\" against the defendant, and thereafter the right applies to all \"critical stages\" of the prosecution, before, during and after trial.

The first state action that could conceivably resemble a formal charge, the filing of the criminal complaint against Roberts for OUI, did not occur until after Roberts refused to submit to the test.  Thus, at the point when Roberts was denied his request to speak with his attorney, the government had not yet committed to prosecuting him for OUI, nor had the government shifted its role from that of investigation to accusation.  We find, therefore, that Roberts' right to counsel had not attached at the time of the alleged violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.  See McVeigh v.

According to Roberts, the mandatory sentencing consequences of refusing to take the blood/alcohol test, combined with the misleading information provided by Maine regarding the consequences that would arise from his refusal to take the test and the denial of Roberts' request to call his attorney to clear up the misunderstanding, somehow transformed the normally investigatory testing procedure into an adversarial, quasi-prosecutorial, sentencing proceeding.  Appealing as this argument may be, we must reject it.  Whatever limited circumstances may exist in which the right to counsel attaches prior to a formal charge, it cannot include the circumstances in the present case because the police were still waiting for the outcome of their investigation--either from the results of the blood/alcohol test or from the fact of defendant's refusal to submit to the test--before deciding whether or not to bring charges against the defendant.  The government had not yet crossed the constitutional divide between investigator and accuser.  As a threshold matter, the right to counsel had not yet attached when Robert's request for counsel was denied, and, therefore, we cannot reach the further, and admittedly close, question of whether or not Roberts decision to take the blood/alcohol test involved a \"critical stage\" of the prosecution at which the right to have the advice of counsel would otherwise be constitutionally required.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">B. Due Process</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We do find merit, however, in Roberts' claim that Officer Main's actions violated Roberts' right to due process.  The combination of circumstances in this case presents a unique situation in which the state of Maine failed to meet the requirements of fundamental fairness.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause of the Constitution prohibits deprivations of life, liberty, or property without \"fundamental fairness\" through governmental conduct that offends the community's sense of justice, decency and fair play.

The police officer took Roberts into custody and, while Roberts was handcuffed at the police station, presented him with a choice that had irrevocable sentencing consequences involving a mandatory period of incarceration.  Roberts was asked to take a blood/alcohol test and told that if he refused to submit to the test, his drivers license would be suspended and the fact of his refusal could be used against him at trial.  Roberts was then informed that he had been \"advised of the consequences of failure to comply.\"   This statement was misleading because there is at least one additional consequence of failing to consent to a test:  a 48-hour term of incarceration.  Roberts was never told that his refusal to take the test could also result in a mandatory two-day jail sentence if he were to be convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol.  Thus, Roberts was not informed of \"the consequences\" of failing to comply with the \"implied consent\" procedure.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Following Officer Main's reading of the \"implied consent\" form, Roberts asked to call his attorney before deciding whether or not to take the blood/alcohol test.  Officer Main denied this request, despite the apparent absence of any inconvenience or unreasonable delay in allowing the phone call.  If allowed to speak with his attorney, Roberts could have been informed of the sentencing consequences of a decision not to submit to the blood/alcohol test, thus clarifying the misleading information provided by Maine's \"implied consent\" form.  The attorney could have also provided advice to Roberts at the only point during the process for determining Roberts' sentence when the mandatory consequences of the two-day term of incarceration could still be avoided.  The attorney's advice would come too late at the sentencing hearing itself, at which time there is nothing the attorney can do to mitigate or rebut the imposition of the 48-hour jail term.  Roberts thus had to make a decision with irrevocable consequences for his sentence after the state provided him with inaccurate information with which he was expected to make that decision.  Under this combination of circumstances, it is incumbent upon the state to honor a reasonable request to call an attorney.  Refusing to provide this simple safeguard violated Roberts' right to due process.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A review of the Mathews factors confirms our conclusion.  The liberty interest deprived by the state's actions in this case is Roberts' freedom from the mandatory two-day jail sentence imposed because of the refusal to take a blood/alcohol test.  Roberts' interest in freedom from incarceration is certainly worthy of substantial due process protections.  See, e.g., United States v. Salerno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 750, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In addition, Maine placed Roberts in a position where he was forced to make a decision between cooperating with investigators and suffering mandatory and irrevocable consequences for his subsequent sentencing.  Cooperation in this case would probably have sealed Roberts' fate at trial but it also would have avoided certain harsher penalties.  Roberts thus faced a situation similar in some respects to plea bargaining.  As such, Maine's \"implied consent\" procedure implicates Roberts' right to receive fair treatment by the prosecution during plea bargaining.  Santobello v.

Because Roberts can do nothing to contest the imposition of a 48-hour term of incarceration at the sentencing hearing itself, the critical point for calculating a key portion of Roberts' sentence essentially occurs at the time Roberts is requested to take the blood/alcohol test.  Thus, this case implicates Roberts' interest in fair sentencing procedures.  Gardner v. Florida, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109622\"><a href=\"/opinion/109622/gardner-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 358, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109622\"><a href=\"/opinion/109622/gardner-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We find, therefore, that Maine's actions towards Roberts implicate important liberty interests deserving of substantial due process protection.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the second consideration under Mathews, the risk of erroneous deprivation of the liberty interest and the probable value of an additional procedural safeguard, we find a strong due process justification for allowing Roberts to contact his attorney.  Although Officer Main's refusal to allow Roberts to call his attorney did not significantly increase the risk that Roberts would be erroneously convicted of an OUI offense, the officer's conduct greatly increased the risk that a two-day jail sentence would be imposed on Roberts as a result of a decision made in reliance upon misleading information.  The erroneous deprivation thus consists of attaching sentencing consequences to a choice that an individual may not have made had the state provided him or her with accurate information.  In other words, absent the inaccurate information, the two-day jail term may not have been imposed.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We are faced here with a unique situation in which the sentencing consequences of incarceration are imposed not so much for the substantive criminal conduct itself but for the separate volitional act of refusing to cooperate with the investigation of that conduct.  As such, an erroneous deprivation of liberty can result from a suspect's behavior under rather dubious circumstances, if not false pretenses, created by the state.  In this case, Roberts might have chosen to cooperate and thus avoid the mandatory term of incarceration if he had been allowed to speak with his lawyer and correct the inaccurate information he received.  Once Roberts' decision was made, however, there was nothing the attorney or judge could do at sentencing to remedy Roberts' tainted decision.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">On the other side of the coin, there is much that allowing Roberts to call his attorney could do to safeguard against the type of erroneous deprivation of liberty at risk in this case.  Plainly and simply, Roberts' attorney could have informed Roberts of the additional sentencing consequences of refusing to take the blood/alcohol test, thus correcting the state's misleading information.  The attorney could also counsel Roberts on the advisability of cooperating to avoid the mandatory two-day sentence.  This is the only point at which such counsel has any value;  once the decision whether or not to submit to the test is made, the die is cast, and nothing the attorney can do at sentencing will mitigate the effect of the two-day sentence.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The present situation thus presents concerns analogous to those expressed by the Supreme Court in many of its right to counsel cases.

We therefore conclude that Maine's implied consent procedure presents a substantial risk of erroneous deprivation of liberty and that allowing Roberts to call his attorney is likely to alleviate the risk and, as such, is a valuable procedural safeguard.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we consider the state's interest in refusing to allow Roberts to call his attorney, including any administrative and fiscal burdens such a phone call would entail.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that allowing Roberts to call his lawyer from the police station would impose on the police any meaningful burden whatsoever.  On the contrary, Maine law allows for suspected drunk drivers to request their own physician to conduct the blood/alcohol test if reasonably available.  29 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1312.  Maine thus already contemplates making reasonable accommodations for drunk driving suspects.  Allowing a simple phone call to an attorney is much less intrusive on the implied consent process than arranging a medical procedure with the suspect's doctor.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Given the transient nature of the evidence in drunk driving cases--that is, the blood/alcohol level in a suspect's blood--the police may certainly proceed with the implied consent procedure if a delay would affect the test results or otherwise interfere with the testing procedure.  The police may refuse to wait for a suspect who is unable to reach an attorney within a reasonable period of time or refuse to undertake time-consuming and burdensome efforts to contact an attorney who is not immediately available.  There is no indication, however, that such was the case here.  Officer Main testified that he did not allow Roberts to call his attorney because Roberts was uncooperative and shouting obscenities.  We see no relevance of this fact to any state interest in refusing to allow Roberts to make a phone call before deciding whether or not to take the blood/alcohol test.  We therefore find no significant state interest in refusing to allow Roberts to call his attorney that would justify what we consider to be a denial of due process.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">To clarify, we do not discount Maine's interest in imposing an implied consent procedure to encourage the voluntary testing of drunk drivers, nor do we have any quarrel with Maine's desire to impose harsher penalties on those refusing to cooperate.  We see very little interest, however, in denying a reasonable request at the police station to call an attorney, where that call could serve to clear up misleading information regarding the testing procedure provided by the state.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we do not find, in this case at least, that a suspected drunk driver has a due process right to contact an attorney whenever the state imposes mandatory sentencing consequences upon the refusal of the suspect to take a blood/alcohol test.  Rather, we find that where the suspect makes a reasonable request to contact his or her attorney and the attorney can correct misleading information provided by the state at a point when the suspect must make a decision that is crucial for his or her subsequent sentencing, due process requires that the suspect's request be honored.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We are confronted with a substantially different situation in this case than the one that the Supreme Court considered in South Dakota v. Neville, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110832\"><a href=\"/opinion/110832/south-dakota-v-neville/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110832\"><a href=\"/opinion/110832/south-dakota-v-neville/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110832\"><a href=\"/opinion/110832/south-dakota-v-neville/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span> </a></span>(1983).  In Neville, the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause was not violated when a police officer failed to warn a suspected drunk driver that his refusal to submit to a blood-alcohol test could be used against him at trial.  The Court reasoned that because the drunk driver in that case was specifically warned that his refusal to submit to the test would result in the suspension of his license, the driver knew that his refusal \"was not a 'safe harbor,' free of adverse consequences.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110832\"><a href=\"/opinion/110832/south-dakota-v-neville/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 566, </a></span>103 S.Ct. at 924.   The Court also noted that it was \"unrealistic to say that the warnings given here implicitly assure a suspect that no consequences other than those mentioned will occur.\"  Id.<sup>2</sup></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Unlike Neville, the present case is not a simple \"failure to warn\" situation involving a state's withholding of information that it was never required to provide.  Rather, this is a case in which a mandatory sentence of incarceration is attached to a suspect's decision to take a blood/alcohol test, where the suspect is given misleading information that indicates no such sentence exists;  and further, where that suspect is denied permission to speak to an attorney who could have cleared up the misunderstanding and who could have provided advice at the only point where the sentencing consequences could be avoided.  The Supreme Court did not address the due process implications of these circumstances.  Instead, Neville dealt with a quite different issue:  the due process implications of a state's failure to warn about the use at trial of a suspect's refusal to take a blood/alcohol test.  The differences between the two cases are stark.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">First, Neville considered an interest of much lower magnitude than Roberts' liberty interest in freedom from incarceration.  As the Supreme Court found, the use of the fact that a suspect refused to submit to a test as evidence against that suspect at trial does not implicate the suspect's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110832\"><a href=\"/opinion/110832/south-dakota-v-neville/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 558-64, </a></span>103 S.Ct. at 919-23.   Thus, the suspect in Neville had no protectable liberty interest beyond the general right to a fair trial, a right which faced little risk of erroneous deprivation in that case.  Neville did not involve a mandatory sentence that risked depriving an individual of the important liberty interest of freedom from incarceration, a liberty interest that is involved here.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, the consequence about which Maine failed to warn Roberts in the present case is irrevocable and irrebuttable, making the suggested procedural safeguard--permission to call an attorney--crucial to protecting Roberts' liberty interest.  In the Neville case, however, the consequences involved an evidentiary disadvantage that could be rebutted, mitigated or otherwise explained by counsel at trial.  The blood/alcohol test, therefore, was not the only point in Neville at which a procedural safeguard would have had any value.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Third, there is an additional element of unfairness in this case, not found in Neville, due to the misleading nature of the instructions given to Roberts.  In the Neville case, the Supreme Court specifically noted that the suspect was given no implicit assurances that he was being warned of all the consequences of refusing to submit to testing, id. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110832\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">566,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110832/south-dakota-v-neville/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span>, whereas in this case, Roberts was told that he had been advised of \"the consequences,\" incorrectly implying that there were no additional consequences.  As a result, Roberts faced a greater risk of erroneous deprivation of his liberty than the suspect in Neville.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Due process may not require warnings of the consequences of refusing to take a blood/alcohol test, and it may not require a full right to counsel for suspects facing the decision whether or not to submit to testing.  Under the circumstances of this case, however, as a matter of fair play and decency, due process does require that Roberts be given a reasonable opportunity to call his attorney before deciding on whether to be tested.</p>\n        <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the mandatory 48-hour jail sentence imposed on Roberts pursuant to Sec. 1312-B(2)(B)(4) violates due process.  The infirmities in the procedures surrounding Roberts' arrest did not, however, taint his underlying convictions for drunk driving and driving with a suspended license.  Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to issue a writ of habeas corpus upon the failure of the State of Maine to vacate the mandatory 48-hour jail sentence imposed pursuant to Sec. 1312-B(2)(B)(4) and to accord Roberts a sentencing hearing at which no minimum sentence is mandated.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">CYR, Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Although I am pleased to concur in the result reached in the ably crafted majority opinion, I write separately on the due process claim.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court (\"Law Court\"), citing State v.

Neville thus upheld the power of the State to penalize refusals to submit to chemical testing, but explicitly conditioned its exercise on the availability of \"appropriate procedural protections.\"  Id.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The procedural due process analysis appropriate to the present context contrasts starkly with the substantive due process analysis in Neville, where the only unwarned adverse consequence was that the State ultimately might be allowed to request the trier of fact, at trial, to infer that the refusal to be tested constituted evidence of his consciousness of guilt (intoxication).  See S.D.Codified Laws Sec. 32-23-10.1.  (1980) (\"such refusal may be admissible\" in evidence at trial.)   In such a setting, a defendant would be afforded the full panoply of procedural protections available at trial.   First, the State's evidentiary proffer of the refusal to be tested would be subject to objection by the defendant;  for example, on grounds that it did not evince the suspect's consciousness of guilt but mere confusion as to his legal rights.  See Fed.R.Evid. 401, 403.  Second, if the refusal were admitted in evidence, the defendant would be allowed to introduce evidence to rebut any \"consciousness of guilt\" inference.  Finally, the trier of fact would be permitted, and could not be required, see Carella v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112298\"><a href=\"/opinion/112298/carella-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 265, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112298\"><a href=\"/opinion/112298/carella-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

All conventional trial procedures for barring and rebutting the refusal evidence remained available, including the right to defend against it on the issue of guilt.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, no meaningful procedure remained for Roberts to defend against the term of confinement mandated upon conviction for OUI as a consequence of the unwarned refusal to be tested.

Furthermore, by instructing the police to bait the \"no-test\" option with the implicit assurance that \"the consequences\" for refusing chemical testing are noncriminal in nature, see supra p. 1299, the standard advisory seems well suited to snare even the most wary suspect.  After all, rarely in the experience of courts, let alone ordinary citizens, are law enforcement officers cast as exclusive advisors to custodial suspects concerning a state-tendered option not to perform an implied duty, and then instructed to warn individual suspects of the noncriminal sanctions for abjuring their duty, without mentioning the criminal consequences.   Under no natural interpretation of the standard advisory is it fair to say that a suspect is afforded meaningful pre-refusal notice of the mandatory minimum sentence.<sup>14</sup>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105925\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Raley,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/105925/raley-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">438-39</span></a></span>, 79 S.Ct. at 1266-67;  cf.

The unwarned mandatory term of confinement--the most serious consequence--surely bears great relevance to the \"no-test\" decision;  even a presumptively determinative relevance in the present circumstances.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Significant derivative risks attach to the inaccurate advisory as well.  No doubt there are many first-time OUI suspects with neither the knowledge nor the experience to assess whether their blood-alcohol content exceeds the prima facie intoxication level prescribed by statute.  For such suspects, at least, it cannot be claimed that an accurate advisory on the mandatory minimum term of confinement attendant upon a refusal to submit to testing would not materially influence their decision.  Thus, the deceptive \"implied consent\" advisory not only risks erroneous conviction (e.g., as a consequence of allowing an unwarned refusal in evidence where chemical testing may have revealed a blood-alcohol content below the prima facie level) but a sentence more severe than would have been imposed by the court but for the suspect's unwarned refusal to be tested (e.g., where reliable test results would have disclosed a blood-alcohol content below the prima facie intoxication level).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The undeniable value of a ready alternative to the deceptive advisory is obvious.  The legitimate interests of the State, as well as the accused, would be significantly advanced by the simple inclusion of a straightforward warning that a first-time refusal to submit to chemical testing must be followed by a minimum term of confinement upon conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  The State would advance its prospects for obtaining the most reliable evidence of intoxication--the suspect's blood-alcohol level, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110126\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mackey,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110126/mackey-v-montrym/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 99 S.Ct. at 2621 (characterizing \"chemical test\" results as \"the most reliable form of evidence of intoxication for use in subsequent proceedings.\")--while the suspect in custody would receive full, fair, and timely notice of the relevant options and their consequences.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(iii) Governmental Interests</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the governmental interests at stake, and the administrative and fiscal burdens attendant to any additional procedural safeguard, must be considered.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mathews,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">347-48</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. at 908-09.

Indeed, it is difficult to posit a legitimate governmental interest served by implicitly misleading OUI suspects into refusing to be tested.  Rather, the State's legitimate interest in obtaining the most reliable evidence of intoxication, through the voluntary cooperation of OUI suspects, is better served by advising the suspect of all sanctions for refusing testing.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The State has a paramount interest in minimizing any pre-testing delay which might render chemical-test results unreliable.  See Schmerber, 384 U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107262\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">770-71,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/107262/schmerber-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110657\"><a href=\"/opinion/110657/logan-v-zimmerman-brush-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 436, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110657\"><a href=\"/opinion/110657/logan-v-zimmerman-brush-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">1266</span> </a></span>(\"While there is no suggestion that the Commission had any intent to deceive the appellants, ... to sustain the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court on such a basis after the Commission had acted as it did would be to sanction the most indefensible sort of entrapment by the State--convicting a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State clearly had told him was available to him.\")</p>\n        <p>13 The standard \"implied consent\" advisory presents suspects with a deceptive choice in two vital respects.  First, the suspect is never informed of the most serious, unmitigable, and irremediable sanction for refusing to be tested.  Second, were the State to choose to force testing upon the suspect notwithstanding his refusal, it is far from clear that the \"option\" of refusal would avail the suspect anything other than a mandatory minimum sentence.  Compare Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 29, Sec. 1312 (1987) with Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 29, Sec. 1312(2) (Supp.1985-86).</p>\n        <p>Unlike the defendant in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565998\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Smith,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/565998/united-states-v-edward-t-smith-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">715</span> </a></span>(rejecting entrapment-by-estoppel claim), there is no suggestion that Roberts had any knowledge that the \"no-test\" option tendered by the arresting officer was punishable by a mandatory term of confinement.  The Smith court reasoned that an alleged \"mixed message\" from a police officer \"could not have reasonably invited [the defendant's] reliance ...\" because it was never claimed that the officer informed Smith that his conduct was lawful.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565998\"><a href=\"/opinion/565998/united-states-v-edward-t-smith-jr/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 715. </a></span>  In the present case, however, reliance upon the deceptive advisory was plainly reasonable.  The alternative conclusion would be either that the information actually provided the suspect at the scene is immaterial, but see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565998\"><a href=\"/opinion/565998/united-states-v-edward-t-smith-jr/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> or that </a></span>constructive notice of the statutory language trumps the knowledge actually acquired by the suspect from the police officer at the scene.  But see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105925\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Raley,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/105925/raley-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">438-39</span></a></span>, 79 S.Ct. at 1266-67.</p>\n        <p>14 Moreover, under the rule of lenity, any ambiguity in the standard \"implied consent\" advisory must be resolved in favor of the accused.  See United States v. Kozminski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112144\"><a href=\"/opinion/112144/united-states-v-kozminski/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>, 952, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112144\"><a href=\"/opinion/112144/united-states-v-kozminski/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2751</span></a></span>, 2764, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112144\"><a href=\"/opinion/112144/united-states-v-kozminski/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span> </a></span>(1988) (identifying purposes underlying rule of lenity as:  the promotion of fair notice \"to those subject to the criminal laws, minimiz[ing] the risk of selective or arbitrary enforcement, and ... maintain[ing] the proper balance between [the legislature], prosecutors and courts....\").</p>\n        <p>15 It is neither plausible to suggest, nor discernible from the record, that the mandatory minimum term of confinement was imposed simply as punishment for the underlying OUI offense.  First, the mandatory minimum sentence was not preordained by the OUI conviction but by the unwarned refusal to submit to testing in the moments following the arrest.  Although it is preconditioned on an OUI conviction, all meaningful discretion on the part of the sentencing court is withdrawn as an unwarned consequence of the defendant's noncriminal refusal to submit to testing.  Second, no mitigating circumstances, either in relation to the refusal to be tested or the commission of the underlying offense, can enable the court to sentence below the mandatory minimum.  Third, the statutory description of the mandatory minimum sentence for refusing testing--as an \"aggravating factor,\" see Sec. 1312-B(2) (\"refusal to submit to a chemical test shall in every case be an aggravating factor\")--is itself a misleading euphemism for what is in reality a conclusive sentencing mandate which the court is required not merely to consider but to impose without regard to any mitigating circumstance.</p>\n        <p>16 The majority opinion persuasively demonstrates that no Sixth Amendment right to counsel arose until well after Roberts refused to be tested.  But though I share the view that Roberts was not accorded the process due when confronted with the choice whether to submit to chemical testing, I am unable to agree with the court that he was entitled to the assistance of counsel at that time, as distinguished from appropriate notice of the consequences of refusing.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
