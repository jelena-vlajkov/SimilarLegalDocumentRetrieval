Plaintiff's  action   was  properly\n                        \n\ndismissed under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state  a\n\ncause of action.\n\n            1.  The  defendants, all private persons,  can not be\n\nheld liable  under 42 U.S.C.    1983  for their  alleged acts  in\n\nemploying \"false representations and phony process to induce  the\n\npolicemen to  falsely arrest\" and imprison  plaintiff because the\n\nprivate defendants'  actions do not constitute  \"state action,\" a\n\nrequisite of a   1983 cause of action.    See Daniel v. Ferguson,\n                                                                \n\n839 F.2d 1124, 1129-31 (5th Cir. 1988) (even if private defendant\n\ndid  provide  police with  false  information,  the state  action\n\nrequirement  for     1983  liability  was  not  satisfied   since\n\n\"[p]olice  reliance in making an arrest on information given by a\n\nprivate  party does not make  the private party  a state actor\").\n\nPlaintiff's citation  below to  Canty v.  Richmond, 383  F. Supp.\n                                                  \n\n1396  (E.D. Va.  1974),  was unavailing  to  establish the  state\n\naction requirement because  in that case,  the plaintiff  alleged\n\nthat  the  private  defendants  had  conspired with  governmental\n\nactors to  falsely arrest  him.   Although  a conspiracy  between\n\nofficial  and private actors is one means through which the state\n\naction  requirement can be satisfied, plaintiff did not allege in\n\nthe  present  case  such  an agreement  between  the  police  and\n\ndefendants to violate plaintiff's rights.  Instead, he  contended\n\nthat defendants had  misled the police with  false statements and\n\nphony documents.\n\n            2.  Nor did plaintiff state a claim under 42 U.S.C.  \n\n1985(2)  for  conspiracy  to  obstruct  state  court  proceedings\n\nbecause plaintiff failed to allege that defendants were motivated\n\nby any  class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.

If plaintiff intended to assert a state law tort\n\naction for false arrest and false imprisonment, plaintiff did not\n\nallege diversity  jurisdiction and failed to  establish any basis\n\nfor the  federal district  court  to exercise  jurisdiction  over\n\nstate law tort claims.\n\n            Affirmed.\n                    \n\n                              - 3 -\n",
