After  the district  court\n                                   \n\ndenied  his suppression  motion, appellant  John Burke  entered a\n\nconditional   guilty  plea   to  a   charge  that   he  knowingly\n\nmanufactured marijuana in  violation of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) and\n\n18  U.S.C.   2.   On appeal, he renews  his claim that the search\n\nwarrant  affidavit  failed  to  show  probable  cause  and  that,\n\nconsequently, evidence  seized from his home  must be suppressed.\n\nHe also claims that  the district court erred in  calculating his\n\nsentence based on 50  marijuana plants and an equivalency  of one\n\nkilogram per plant.  We affirm.\n\n                        I. Probable Cause\n                                         \n\n     In July 1991, Bangor Police Officer Roy McKinney applied for\n\na warrant to search  the home occupied by appellant Burke and his\n\nwife  Susan at 330  Fern Street in Bangor,  Maine.  The affidavit\n\nfiled by McKinney in support of the warrant application described\n\ntwo  conversations  in  which   an  unidentified  individual  had\n\nreported to  a confidential  informant about an  indoor marijuana\n\ngrowing operation.  The informant, who had proven reliable in the\n\npast,  had passed on the  information to a  Detective Gastia, who\n\nthen passed it on to McKinney.\n\n     As reported  in the affidavit, the  unidentified person made\n\nthe following assertions:\n\n     (1) A person named \"John\" was growing 40 marijuana plants in\nhis house;\n     (2) The  unidentified person had been to John's house, which\nwas on Fern Street in Bangor, and it \"reeked\" of marijuana;\n     (3) The house had a new addition;\n     (4) A search warrant previously had been executed  at John's\nhouse, resulting  in  the seizure  of  marijuana plants  from  an\nindoor growing operation;\n\n                               -2-\n\n     (5) John had \"beat the charge\".\n     The  affidavit  also   contained  the  following  additional\n\ninformation from McKinney:1\n\n     (6)  In 1989, McKinney had executed a warrant at the home of\nJohn Burke, at 330 Fern Street, and uncovered an elaborate indoor\nmarijuana growing operation;\n     (7)  John Burke had  not been prosecuted  in connection with\nthe 1989 seizure;\n     (8) 330 Fern Street had a new addition;\n     (9)  Two cars parked  at 330 Fern  Street on June  19, 1991,\nwere identified  through Department  of Motor Vehicle  records as\nbelonging to Susan and John Burke, of 330 Fern Street;\n     (10) Power consumption records  for 330 Fern Street revealed\na pattern of usage  consistent with indoor marijuana cultivation,\nwith  a  dramatic drop  in usage  following  the 1989  search and\nsubstantial increases beginning again in the fall of 1990.\n\n     Burke contends  that this  affidavit was deficient  and that\n\nthe warrant therefore was invalid.  His primary complaint is that\n\nthe  central   information  in   the  affidavit  comes   from  an\n\nunidentified  person   whose  reliability  and   credibility  are\n\nuntested and unknown.  The issuing judge, he argues, had no basis\n\nupon  which to  credit  this individual's  assertions, which  had\n\npassed  through two  other  persons before  reaching the  affiant\n\nMcKinney.\n\n     Our limited role in evaluating a judge's decision to issue a\n\nsearch warrant is well established:\n\n          We review  the issuance  of a search  warrant with\n     \"great deference,\"  United States  v. Ciampa, 793  F.2d\n                                                 \n     19,  22 (1st Cir. 1986), to verify that there existed a\n\n                    \n\n1 Defendant makes much of the fact that the affidavit reports the\ninformant's  conversations with Gastia \"in substance\" rather than\nverbatim.    Unlike Burke,  we do  not  believe that  this phrase\nsuggests  that the  information  provided to  the magistrate  was\nunreliable.  In our view, McKinney used the  phrase to inform the\nmagistrate fully  that he was providing what  he believed to be a\nsubstantively accurate,  though not word-for-word,  report of the\nconversations between Gastia and the informant.   \n\n                               -3-\n\n     \"substantial  basis\" for the judicial officer's common-\n     sense determination that,  \"given all the circumstances\n     set  forth in  the  affidavit .  .  . ,  including  the\n     `veracity'   and  `basis   of  knowledge'   of  persons\n     supplying  hearsay  information,  there  [was]  a  fair\n     probability  that  contraband  or evidence  of  a crime\n     [would] be found in a particular place.\"\n\nUnited States v. Scalia, No. 93-1018, slip op. at 4 (1st Cir. May\n                       \n\n21,  1993) (quoting United States  v. Caggiano, 899  F.2d 99, 102\n                                              \n\n(1st  Cir. 1990) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39\n                                           \n\n(1983))).      Having  conducted   such   a   \"totality  of   the\n\ncircumstances\" scrutiny  of the affidavit here,  we are satisfied\n\nthat the issuing  judge had substantial  support for his  finding\n\nthat \"there existed a fair probability that marijuana and related\n\nparaphernalia would  be found in  appellant's residence,\" Scalia,\n                                                                \n\nslip op. at 8-9.  Although the original source of the information\n\nleading to the search was anonymous, several  factors vouched for\n\nthe reliability  of this  person's assertions.   Most significant\n\nwas  McKinney's  experience  and knowledge  as  a  result of  his\n\ninvolvement in the  1989 search  of Burke's home.   The  source's\n\ninformation  that an  individual on  Fern Street  named John  was\n\ngrowing  marijuana  dovetailed  with  McKinney's  knowledge  that\n\nmarijuana  plants had been seized two years earlier from the home\n\nof John Burke  at 330 Fern Street.   The source's  further report\n\nthat  \"John\"  had \"beat  the  charge\"  coincided with  McKinney's\n\nknowledge that Burke  had not been prosecuted as  a result of the\n\n1989 seizure.   This coincidence of McKinney's knowledge with the\n\nsource's information served to corroborate that information.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States  v. Taylor,  985 F.2d  3,  6 (1st  Cir. 1993)  (\"An\n                        \n\n                               -4-\n\naffiant's knowledge  of the  target's prior criminal  activity or\n\nrecord clearly is material to the probable cause determination.\")\n\n     It  also is  significant that  the source's  information was\n\nbased on personal observation.  See Scalia, slip op. at  7.  This\n                                          \n\nindividual had been to Burke's home and reported that it \"reeked\"\n\nof marijuana.  But see United States v. DeLeon, 979 F.2d 761, 765\n                                              \n\n(9th  Cir.  1992)  (warrant  cannot  be  based  on  untrained  or\n\ninexperienced person's claim to  have smelled growing plants that\n\nhave  no commonly recognized odor).   The source  also noted that\n\nthe house had  a new  addition, a fact  corroborated by  McKinney\n\nbased on both  his 1989 search and  a drive-by after he  received\n\nthe 1991 tip.\n\n     Some  weight also attaches to  the established record of the\n\nconfidential  informant,  through  whom  the  unidentified source\n\ncommunicated to the police officers.  According to the affidavit,\n\nthat informant  (\"CI#102\") had  provided information in  the past\n\nthat led to three felony drug arrests and the  seizure of several\n\npounds  of marijuana.    In addition,  McKinney  stated that  the\n\ninformant recently had provided  information to him and Detective\n\nGastia  that  was used  to  secure  another search  warrant  that\n\nresulted indiscovery ofan indoor marijuanacultivating operation.2\n\n                    \n\n2  If we  were to  assign  no weight  to the  reliability of  the\ninformant in this context,  we would be in the  peculiar position\nof  inviting  informants  to  be  less  forthcoming  about  their\nsources.   For example, to avoid questions about the unidentified\nperson, the  informant could  have relayed the  information about\nthe Fern Street marijuana operation as if it were the informant's\ndirect  knowledge.  The issuing judge  then would have considered\nonly the  informant's veracity and reliability  in evaluating the\nwarrant  application.   In  any event,  we  think that  the  past\n\n                               -5-\n\n     McKinney's  own  investigation   further  corroborated   the\n\nlikelihood that  Burke once  again was  growing marijuana  at 330\n\nFern  Street.  The power  source records he  obtained showed that\n\nthe residents  of  330  Fern Street  resumed  an  unusually  high\n\nconsumption of electricity after a  lapse in time that  coincided\n\nwith  the  period  immediately  following  the  1989  search  and\n\nseizure, when Burke predictably  would have been inclined  to lie\n\nlow.  McKinney confirmed that the  Burkes still lived at 330 Fern\n\nStreet  by checking  motor vehicle  records for  the cars  parked\n\nthere. \n\n     This confluence of factors was  more than ample to establish\n\nprobable  cause.   Although the  multi-link chain  of information\n\nbegan with  an unidentified  individual, the reliability  of that\n\ninformation  was   reinforced  by  the  proven   history  of  the\n\nconfidential  informant, McKinney's  personal knowledge,  and the\n\ndocumentary   evidence  developed  through  investigation.    The\n\nstandard  of probable cause  requires a probability,  not a prima\n\nfacie  showing,  of criminal  activity.    See United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nCiampa, 793 F.2d  19, 22  (1st Cir. 1986).   Unquestionably,  the\n      \n\nissuing judge  here was given  a sufficient basis  for concluding\n\nthat a new crop of marijuana probably was being cultivated at 330\n\nFern Street.\n\n                    \n\nhistory of the informant is relevant and does strengthen the case\nfor the warrant: it  suggests not only that the  information from\nthe original source is being accurately reported but, as a matter\nof fact, that the informant has reliable sources.\n\n                               -6-\n\n     We take a moment to discuss briefly Burke's allegation  that\n\nthe warrant was defective because of a material omission from the\n\naffidavit.   He  claims that  McKinney was  at least  reckless in\n\nfailing to notify the magistrate that the unidentified source had\n\nreported  that \"John\" had \"beat  the [1989] charge  due to search\n                                                                 \n\nand  seizure problems.\"  The affidavit  did not give a reason for\n                     \n\nthe lack of prosecution.\n\n     The district court held  an evidentiary hearing into Burke's\n\nclaim  that  material  information  had been  excluded  from  the\n\naffidavit, concluding  that there was \"no indication  of any kind\n\nof deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard of the truth.\"  See\n                                                                 \n\nTr.  of July 16, 1992, at  28.  We are  satisfied that that court\n\nfully explored this issue, and that no basis for invalidating the\n\nwarrant  exists.  Any  discrepancy between the  actual reason for\n\nthe lack of prosecution  in 1989 and the source's  explanation is\n\nof marginal significance,  if any, to  the existence of  probable\n\ncause.    In  our  view,  the  crucial  fact  was   the  lack  of\n\nprosecution, and on that point, the source and affiant were fully\n\nin accord.\n\n                       II. Number of Plants\n                                           \n\n     Under the  Sentencing Guidelines,  when an offense  involves\n\nfifty or more marijuana  plants, the court is required  to equate\n\neach plant  with  one kilogram  of marijuana  in determining  the\n\ndefendant's  base offense  level.   See U.S.S.G.    2D1.1.   When\n                                       \n\n                               -7-\n\nfewer  than fifty  plants are  at issue,  the equivalency  is 100\n\ngrams for each plant.3\n\n     The  district court  found  that the  offense here  involved\n\nfifty  plants, and  Burke  consequently was  sentenced under  the\n\nharsher one-kilogram-per-plant standard.  The court's computation\n\nincluded 32  plants ranging in  size from one-  to three-and-one-\n\nhalf feet that  were found in  a large basement  room in the  new\n\naddition and two  plants of  similar size found  in an  adjoining\n\nsmaller  room.   The  court  also  included 16  one-to-three-inch\n\ncuttings, each growing  in a separate pot, that were found in the\n\nsmall room.4 \n\n     Burke disputes the district  court's calculation.  He argues\n\nthat at least some,  and perhaps all, of  the 16 small  replanted\n\ncuttings lacked sufficient root  development to be deemed plants.\n\nAnd he  emphasizes that an error  on just one plant  would have a\n\n                    \n\n3 The relevant portion of the provision is as follows:\n\n          In  the case  of  an offense  involving  marihuana\n     plants,  if  the  offense   involved  (A)  50  or  more\n     marihuana plants,  treat each plant as  equivalent to 1\n     KG of  marihuana; (B)  fewer than 50  marihuana plants,\n     treat  each plant as equivalent to  100 G of marihuana.\n     Provided,  however, that  if the  actual weight  of the\n     marihuana  is greater,  use  the actual  weight of  the\n     marihuana.\n\n4 A total of 36 one-to-three-inch cuttings was found in the small\nroom.  Although the  court believed that all of these were likely\nto  be plants within the  meaning of the  Guidelines, the experts\nwho testified at the  sentencing hearing had examined only  16 of\nthem.  The  court therefore  decided to give  the defendant  \"the\nbenefit  of the  doubt\"  and to  exclude  the other  20  from his\ncalculation.  See Tr. of Aug. 12, 1992, at 86.\n                 \n\n                               -8-\n\ndramatic impact on his sentence because of the 50-plant threshold\n\nfor the one-kilogram equivalency.\n\n     The  district  court's determination  that  the  16 cuttings\n\nshould  be   classified  as   plants  rests   both  on  a   legal\n\ndetermination -- what constitutes a \"plant\" under the guidelines?\n\n--  and  a factual  determination --  did  the cuttings  at issue\n\nfulfill those requirements?  After a careful review of the record\n\nand caselaw, we find no reversible error in either respect.\n\n     The  court defined  a plant  for sentencing  purposes as  \"a\n\ncutting with a root formation,\" Tr. of August 12, at 85.  This is\n\nconsistent with the definition previously accepted by this court,\n\nsee United States  v. McMahon, 935 F.2d 397,  401 (1st Cir. 1991)\n                             \n\n(defining  plants as  \"cuttings with  roots\"), as  well  as other\n\ncourts, see, e.g., United States v. Edge, 989  F.2d 871, 879 (6th\n                                        \n\nCir.  1993)  (a  marijuana  cutting  is  a  \"plant\"  for  federal\n\nsentencing purposes  \"if there is readily  observable evidence of\n\nroot formation\");  United States  v. Bechtol, 939  F.2d 603,  604\n                                            \n\n(8th Cir. 1991) (a cutting with \"root hairs\" -- \"fine projections\n\ncoming from the stem\" -- is a plant); United States  v. Eves, 932\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  856, 859  (10th  Cir. 1991)  (endorsing  holding in  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

Speltz,\n                                                                \n\n733  F. Supp. 1311, 1312  (D. Minn. 1990)  (\"cuttings with roots\"\n\nare  marijuana plants).   We see  no reason  to depart  from this\n\nrelatively straightforward, widely utilized standard.\n\n                               -9-\n\n     Indeed,  even Burke agrees that  the presence of  roots is a\n\ndeterminative  factor  in  identifying  a plant.    He  suggests,\n\nhowever,  a  more  functional   approach  than  is  reflected  by\n\nprecedent.  Based  on the  testimony presented by  his expert  at\n\ntrial, Burke  argues that new growth  on a cutting may  be termed\n\nroots -- and the cutting identified as a \"plant\" -- only when the\n\ngrowth \"physiologically functions as a root.\"  See Brief at 21.\n                                                  \n\n     We  decline to  embrace  this functional  refinement to  the\n\n\"cuttings  with  roots\" definition.    If  a cutting  has  growth\n\nextending from its base  that is differentiated from its  stem or\n\nstalk,  a court  must  be  permitted  to  use  its  eyesight  and\n\ncommonsense to conclude that it has before it a plant with roots.\n\nTo  require a court to determine whether the growth is performing\n\nall of the technical functions of roots is to complicate a matter\n\nthat Congress intended to simplify:\n\n     As Judge Devitt noted in [United States v.] Fitol, [733\n                                                      \n     F. Supp. 1312 (D. Minn. 1990)], the legislative purpose\n     was to remedy the problems  associated with determining\n     the weight  of marijuana -- specifically, whether seeds\n     and  stems should  be  weighed in  the  mix --  and  to\n     supplant this test with a more simple  method; a method\n     providing  that the  number  of \"plants  regardless  of\n     weight\" would  trigger the mandatory  minimum sentence.\n     733  F.   Supp.  at  1315.     We  perceive   that  the\n     congressional   intent  was   to   simplify,   not   to\n     complicate, the  method of determining the  high end or\n     low end mandatory sentences.  To accept the appellant's\n     formulation  would   be  to   turn  our  face   on  the\n     legislative purpose.\n\nEves, 932 F.2d at 860 (quoted in Edge, 989 F.2d at  878).  In our\n                                     \n\nview,  plant status  is  sufficiently established  when there  is\n\n\"some readily observable evidence of root formation,\"   Edge, 989\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 877.  In other words, at the first sign of roots, a plant\n\n                               -10-\n\nexists for sentencing  purposes.   Cf. Bechtol, 939  F.2d at  605\n                                              \n\n(rejecting viability as the  standard for whether a cutting  is a\n\nplant); Eves, 932 F.2d at 857 (same).\n            \n\n     It  is the government's burden  to prove, by a preponderance\n\nof the  evidence, that each of  the 16 contested specimens  was a\n\nplant.   See United States  v. Wright, 873 F.2d  437, 441-42 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.  1989) (preponderance  of the  evidence standard  applies to\n\nsentencing issues).   The district court's finding that  each had\n\nsufficient  root development to be  classified as a  plant may be\n\nreversed only for  clear error. See Eves, 932 F.2d at 859; United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Carlisle, 907 F.2d 94, 96 (9th Cir. 1990) (per curiam).\n                  \n\n     We find no such  error.  The district court  heard extensive\n\ntestimony from two  experts, viewed a  videotape of the  cuttings\n\ntaken  at the time of the seizure, and examined photographs taken\n\nby the defendant's expert after the cuttings had been pulled from\n\ntheir pots and  dried.  Both experts agreed that  the cuttings as\n\nviewed in the videotape  were healthy and thriving.   Both agreed\n\nthat at least some of the cuttings when examined displayed growth\n\nfrom  the base,  and  that  the  videotape  showed  that  all  36\n\nspecimens  in the small room  (20 of which  the court discounted,\n\nsee supra at n.4) were of similar height and condition.\n         \n\n     With this consensus  as a foundation, the district court had\n\nample support for finding that the cuttings all were sufficiently\n\ndeveloped to be classified  as plants.  The government's  expert,\n\nDr. Lydon, explicitly testified that the growth on the six to ten\n\ncuttings  that he personally examined was a form of roots, and he\n\n                               -11-\n\nfound the remnants of roots in the growing medium from which  the\n\ncuttings had been removed.   He identified roots on 12 of  the 16\n\ncuttings shown in the photographs.  He further testified that the\n\nleaves on  the cuttings in  the videotape could  be as large  and\n\nhealthy  as they  were only  if there  existed a  root system  to\n\nsustain them.   This was  particularly so, he  said, because  the\n\ncuttings were placed under intense light to spur their growth. \n\n     Although  the defense expert,  Professor Colby, contradicted\n\ncertain of Lydon's testimony, it  was within the district court's\n\nprovince to evaluate what  it heard and make judgments  about the\n\nweight to attribute to each expert's views.  Colby stated that he\n\nsaw  no plant  matter in  the  rock wool  that had  contained the\n\ncuttings.   The court,  however, reasonably could  credit Lydon's\n\ncontrary  testimony in light  of its own ability  to see roots on\n\nmost of the 16 cuttings in Colby's photographs.  Similarly, Colby\n\ntestified that  the growth at  the base  of the cuttings  was not\n\nroots  but simply \"primordia,\" or the precursor of roots to come.\n\nIn   our   view,   the   court   properly   could   reject   this\n\ncharacterization   of  the   growth  because   Colby's  testimony\n\nprimarily focused on when  plants have \"functional root systems,\"\n\nsee Tr. of August 6, at  37, rather than on when the  first stage\n   \n\nof the system manifests.5\n\n                    \n\n5 Colby testified that the \"newly emerging growth\" at the base of\nsome  of  the  cuttings  was  not  \"roots\"  because  it  was  not\nperforming  the function of roots.   Tr. of August  6, at 38.  He\nexplained  that  one  of  the  critical  functions  of  roots  --\nabsorbing water -- requires  root hairs.  The root  hairs develop\non  secondary  roots, which  in turn  are  formed off  of primary\nroots.  Id.  He further testified:\n           \n\n                               -12-\n\n     Burke  makes  much  of the  fact  that  both  Lydon and  the\n\ndistrict court acknowledged  that several of the  cuttings in the\n\nphotographs showed no visible signs of roots.   See Tr. of August\n                                                   \n\n12, at 47, 52, 67.  The testimony, however, clearly permitted the\n\ndistrict  court to conclude  that each  of the  similarly healthy\n\nplants in  the videotape must  have had  the same  level of  root\n\ngrowth  as  the  six  to ten  examined  by  Lydon,  and that  the\n\ninability  to see  them  in the  photographs  was the  result  of\n\nfuzziness in the pictures or loss of the roots when  the cuttings\n\nwere pulled from the pots and dried.\n\n     Two  other points  highlighted  by Burke  similarly fail  to\n\nundermine  the  district  court's  finding.    Detective McKinney\n\ntestified that the  cuttings continued to  grow for several  days\n\nfollowing their  seizure,  and Burke  suggests that  it was  only\n\nduring  this time  -- if  at all --  that the  cuttings developed\n\nenough to be  termed plants.   The district  court, however,  was\n\nfree  to   credit  Lydon's  contrary  testimony   that  the  root\n\n                    \n\n     What we're looking for is a root system.   And in order\n     for  a plant  to be  classified as  a fully  functional\n     living  organism . . . it's got to have functional root\n     systems, leaf systems and stem systems.\"  Id. at 38-39.\n                                                  \n\n     In his testimony  on the process  by which cuttings  develop\nroots, Lydon stated that callus tissue first develops in the spot\nwhere roots later will emerge.  Tr.  of August 12, at 34.  In his\nview, when  sufficient tissue  develops  at that  location to  be\ndifferentiated from the stem,  the root system has begun  and the\nspecimen  may be  defined  as  a  \"cutting  with  roots.\"    This\ndescription is consistent with the approach for recognizing roots\nadopted by  the court in Edge  (callus tissue is not  a root, but\n                             \nsmall  \"hair-like  projections\"  are  the  beginning  of  a  root\nsystem).  See 989 F.2d at 878-79 &amp; nn.9, 10.\n             \n\n                               -13-\n\ndevelopment he saw could  not have been achieved in  just several\n\ndays.  See Tr. of August 12, at 16.\n          \n\n     Burke  also  challenges Lydon's  reliance  on  the size  and\n\nhealth  of the leaves to support his conclusion that the cuttings\n\nmust have  had roots.   He notes  that the government  expert was\n\nunable  to  say  unequivocally that  Burke  had  removed  all the\n\npreviously grown  large leaves from the  cuttings before planting\n\nthem  -- the  technique  typically used  by experienced  growers.\n\nBurke's theory is that, if the leaves as viewed in  the videotape\n\nwere on the plants before the replanting, their size would not be\n\nevidence of  functioning roots.   But  Lydon's testimony  was not\n\npremised solely on the  size of the  leaves.  He saw  significant\n\nroot  formation, and primarily relied  on the size  of the leaves\n\nonly for his  conclusion that  the plants he  did not  personally\n\nobserve must have had the same root development.\n\n     Finally,  Burke contends  that, at  the least,  the district\n\ncourt  should have reduced the number  of plants by 10 percent to\n\nreflect the  typical failure  rate of  marijuana cuttings.   This\n\ntheory, adopted by  the court in United States v.  Angell, 794 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp.  874, 876  (D.  Minn. 1992),  was  never presented  to  the\n\ndistrict court, and  we decline to consider it for the first time\n\non appeal.   See McMahon,  935 F.2d  at 399-400.   Defendant  had\n                        \n\nample  opportunity to  develop  support for  this theory  through\n\neither of the two experts who testified.  On this record, we have\n\nno basis for disturbing the district court's calculation.\n\n                         III. Due Process\n                                         \n\n                               -14-\n\n     Burke  argues that  the  equivalency  of  one plant  to  one\n\nkilogram  of  marijuana  in  the Sentencing  Guidelines  lacks  a\n\nrational  basis  and therefore  constitutes  a  violation of  due\n\nprocess.  This court recently rejected this argument, see Taylor,\n                                                                \n\n985 F.2d at  9.  Although Burke attempts to  distinguish his case\n\nbecause  it involves  a different  and allegedly  less productive\n\nvariety  of the marijuana plant, the rationale of Taylor is fully\n                                                        \n\napplicable.  See id. (\"Congress reasonably may opt for a punitive\n                    \n\ndeterrent against large-scale marijuana  manufacturing operations\n\nwhich  pose a  greater  threat than  small-scale operations,  and\n\nwarrant   exponentially  enhanced   punishment.\")     This  claim\n\ntherefore also fails.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                                   Concurrence follows.\n\n                               -15-\n\n     OAKES, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.

Probable Cause\n                                         \n\n     In July 1991, Bangor Police Officer Roy McKinney applied for\n\na warrant to search  the home occupied by appellant Burke and his\n\nwife  Susan at 330  Fern Street in Bangor,  Maine.  The affidavit\n\nfiled by McKinney in support of the warrant application described\n\ntwo  conversations  in  which   an  unidentified  individual  had\n\nreported to  a confidential  informant about an  indoor marijuana\n\ngrowing operation.  The informant, who had proven reliable in the\n\npast,  had passed on the  information to a  Detective Gastia, who\n\nthen passed it on to McKinney.\n\n     As reported  in the affidavit, the  unidentified person made\n\nthe following assertions:\n\n     (1) A person named \"John\" was growing 40 marijuana plants in\nhis house;\n     (2) The  unidentified person had been to John's house, which\nwas on Fern Street in Bangor, and it \"reeked\" of marijuana;\n     (3) The house had a new addition;\n     (4) A search warrant previously had been executed  at John's\nhouse, resulting  in  the seizure  of  marijuana plants  from  an\nindoor growing operation;\n\n                               -2-\n\n     (5) John had \"beat the charge\".\n     The  affidavit  also   contained  the  following  additional\n\ninformation from McKinney:1\n\n     (6)  In 1989, McKinney had executed a warrant at the home of\nJohn Burke, at 330 Fern Street, and uncovered an elaborate indoor\nmarijuana growing operation;\n     (7)  John Burke had  not been prosecuted  in connection with\nthe 1989 seizure;\n     (8) 330 Fern Street had a new addition;\n     (9)  Two cars parked  at 330 Fern  Street on June  19, 1991,\nwere identified  through Department  of Motor Vehicle  records as\nbelonging to Susan and John Burke, of 330 Fern Street;\n     (10) Power consumption records  for 330 Fern Street revealed\na pattern of usage  consistent with indoor marijuana cultivation,\nwith  a  dramatic drop  in usage  following  the 1989  search and\nsubstantial increases beginning again in the fall of 1990.\n\n     Burke contends  that this  affidavit was deficient  and that\n\nthe warrant therefore was invalid.  His primary complaint is that\n\nthe  central   information  in   the  affidavit  comes   from  an\n\nunidentified  person   whose  reliability  and   credibility  are\n\nuntested and unknown.  The issuing judge, he argues, had no basis\n\nupon  which to  credit  this individual's  assertions, which  had\n\npassed  through two  other  persons before  reaching the  affiant\n\nMcKinney.\n\n     Our limited role in evaluating a judge's decision to issue a\n\nsearch warrant is well established:\n\n          We review  the issuance  of a search  warrant with\n     \"great deference,\"  United States  v.

Although the original source of the information\n\nleading to the search was anonymous, several  factors vouched for\n\nthe reliability  of this  person's assertions.   Most significant\n\nwas  McKinney's  experience  and knowledge  as  a  result of  his\n\ninvolvement in the  1989 search  of Burke's home.   The  source's\n\ninformation  that an  individual on  Fern Street  named John  was\n\ngrowing  marijuana  dovetailed  with  McKinney's  knowledge  that\n\nmarijuana  plants had been seized two years earlier from the home\n\nof John Burke  at 330 Fern Street.   The source's  further report\n\nthat  \"John\"  had \"beat  the  charge\"  coincided with  McKinney's\n\nknowledge that Burke  had not been prosecuted as  a result of the\n\n1989 seizure.   This coincidence of McKinney's knowledge with the\n\nsource's information served to corroborate that information.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States  v.

The source  also noted that\n\nthe house had  a new  addition, a fact  corroborated by  McKinney\n\nbased on both  his 1989 search and  a drive-by after he  received\n\nthe 1991 tip.\n\n     Some  weight also attaches to  the established record of the\n\nconfidential  informant,  through  whom  the  unidentified source\n\ncommunicated to the police officers.  According to the affidavit,\n\nthat informant  (\"CI#102\") had  provided information in  the past\n\nthat led to three felony drug arrests and the  seizure of several\n\npounds  of marijuana.    In addition,  McKinney  stated that  the\n\ninformant recently had provided  information to him and Detective\n\nGastia  that  was used  to  secure  another search  warrant  that\n\nresulted indiscovery ofan indoor marijuanacultivating operation.2\n\n                    \n\n2  If we  were to  assign  no weight  to the  reliability of  the\ninformant in this context,  we would be in the  peculiar position\nof  inviting  informants  to  be  less  forthcoming  about  their\nsources.   For example, to avoid questions about the unidentified\nperson, the  informant could  have relayed the  information about\nthe Fern Street marijuana operation as if it were the informant's\ndirect  knowledge.  The issuing judge  then would have considered\nonly the  informant's veracity and reliability  in evaluating the\nwarrant  application.   In  any event,  we  think that  the  past\n\n                               -5-\n\n     McKinney's  own  investigation   further  corroborated   the\n\nlikelihood that  Burke once  again was  growing marijuana  at 330\n\nFern  Street.  The power  source records he  obtained showed that\n\nthe residents  of  330  Fern Street  resumed  an  unusually  high\n\nconsumption of electricity after a  lapse in time that  coincided\n\nwith  the  period  immediately  following  the  1989  search  and\n\nseizure, when Burke predictably  would have been inclined  to lie\n\nlow.  McKinney confirmed that the  Burkes still lived at 330 Fern\n\nStreet  by checking  motor vehicle  records for  the cars  parked\n\nthere. \n\n     This confluence of factors was  more than ample to establish\n\nprobable  cause.   Although the  multi-link chain  of information\n\nbegan with  an unidentified  individual, the reliability  of that\n\ninformation  was   reinforced  by  the  proven   history  of  the\n\nconfidential  informant, McKinney's  personal knowledge,  and the\n\ndocumentary   evidence  developed  through  investigation.    The\n\nstandard  of probable cause  requires a probability,  not a prima\n\nfacie  showing,  of criminal  activity.    See United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nCiampa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471650\"><a href=\"/opinion/471650/united-states-v-vincent-ciampa/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22  (1st Cir. 1986).   Unquestionably,  the\n      \n\nissuing judge  here was given  a sufficient basis  for concluding\n\nthat a new crop of marijuana probably was being cultivated at 330\n\nFern Street.\n\n                    \n\nhistory of the informant is relevant and does strengthen the case\nfor the warrant: it  suggests not only that the  information from\nthe original source is being accurately reported but, as a matter\nof fact, that the informant has reliable sources.\n\n                               -6-\n\n     We take a moment to discuss briefly Burke's allegation  that\n\nthe warrant was defective because of a material omission from the\n\naffidavit.   He  claims that  McKinney was  at least  reckless in\n\nfailing to notify the magistrate that the unidentified source had\n\nreported  that \"John\" had \"beat  the [1989] charge  due to search\n                                                                 \n\nand  seizure problems.\"  The affidavit  did not give a reason for\n                     \n\nthe lack of prosecution.\n\n     The district court held  an evidentiary hearing into Burke's\n\nclaim  that  material  information  had been  excluded  from  the\n\naffidavit, concluding  that there was \"no indication  of any kind\n\nof deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard of the truth.\"  See\n                                                                 \n\nTr.  of July 16, 1992, at  28.  We are  satisfied that that court\n\nfully explored this issue, and that no basis for invalidating the\n\nwarrant  exists.  Any  discrepancy between the  actual reason for\n\nthe lack of prosecution  in 1989 and the source's  explanation is\n\nof marginal significance,  if any, to  the existence of  probable\n\ncause.    In  our  view,  the  crucial  fact  was   the  lack  of\n\nprosecution, and on that point, the source and affiant were fully\n\nin accord.\n\n                       II. Number of Plants\n                                           \n\n     Under the  Sentencing Guidelines,  when an offense  involves\n\nfifty or more marijuana  plants, the court is required  to equate\n\neach plant  with  one kilogram  of marijuana  in determining  the\n\ndefendant's  base offense  level.   See U.S.S.G.    2D1.1.   When\n                                       \n\n                               -7-\n\nfewer  than fifty  plants are  at issue,  the equivalency  is 100\n\ngrams for each plant.3\n\n     The  district court  found  that the  offense here  involved\n\nfifty  plants, and  Burke  consequently was  sentenced under  the\n\nharsher one-kilogram-per-plant standard.  The court's computation\n\nincluded 32  plants ranging in  size from one-  to three-and-one-\n\nhalf feet that  were found in  a large basement  room in the  new\n\naddition and two  plants of  similar size found  in an  adjoining\n\nsmaller  room.   The  court  also  included 16  one-to-three-inch\n\ncuttings, each growing  in a separate pot, that were found in the\n\nsmall room.4 \n\n     Burke disputes the district  court's calculation.  He argues\n\nthat at least some,  and perhaps all, of  the 16 small  replanted\n\ncuttings lacked sufficient root  development to be deemed plants.\n\nAnd he  emphasizes that an error  on just one plant  would have a\n\n                    \n\n3 The relevant portion of the provision is as follows:\n\n          In  the case  of  an offense  involving  marihuana\n     plants,  if  the  offense   involved  (A)  50  or  more\n     marihuana plants,  treat each plant as  equivalent to 1\n     KG of  marihuana; (B)  fewer than 50  marihuana plants,\n     treat  each plant as equivalent to  100 G of marihuana.\n     Provided,  however, that  if the  actual weight  of the\n     marihuana  is greater,  use  the actual  weight of  the\n     marihuana.\n\n4 A total of 36 one-to-three-inch cuttings was found in the small\nroom.  Although the  court believed that all of these were likely\nto  be plants within the  meaning of the  Guidelines, the experts\nwho testified at the  sentencing hearing had examined only  16 of\nthem.  The  court therefore  decided to give  the defendant  \"the\nbenefit  of the  doubt\"  and to  exclude  the other  20  from his\ncalculation.  See Tr. of Aug. 12, 1992, at 86.\n                 \n\n                               -8-\n\ndramatic impact on his sentence because of the 50-plant threshold\n\nfor the one-kilogram equivalency.\n\n     The  district  court's determination  that  the  16 cuttings\n\nshould  be   classified  as   plants  rests   both  on  a   legal\n\ndetermination -- what constitutes a \"plant\" under the guidelines?\n\n--  and  a factual  determination --  did  the cuttings  at issue\n\nfulfill those requirements?  After a careful review of the record\n\nand caselaw, we find no reversible error in either respect.\n\n     The  court defined  a plant  for sentencing  purposes as  \"a\n\ncutting with a root formation,\" Tr. of August 12, at 85.  This is\n\nconsistent with the definition previously accepted by this court,\n\nsee United States  v.

He  suggests,\n\nhowever,  a  more  functional   approach  than  is  reflected  by\n\nprecedent.  Based  on the  testimony presented by  his expert  at\n\ntrial, Burke  argues that new growth  on a cutting may  be termed\n\nroots -- and the cutting identified as a \"plant\" -- only when the\n\ngrowth \"physiologically functions as a root.\"  See Brief at 21.\n                                                  \n\n     We  decline to  embrace  this functional  refinement to  the\n\n\"cuttings  with  roots\" definition.

The government's  expert,\n\nDr. Lydon, explicitly testified that the growth on the six to ten\n\ncuttings  that he personally examined was a form of roots, and he\n\n                               -11-\n\nfound the remnants of roots in the growing medium from which  the\n\ncuttings had been removed.   He identified roots on 12 of  the 16\n\ncuttings shown in the photographs.  He further testified that the\n\nleaves on  the cuttings in  the videotape could  be as large  and\n\nhealthy  as they  were only  if there  existed a  root system  to\n\nsustain them.   This was  particularly so, he  said, because  the\n\ncuttings were placed under intense light to spur their growth. \n\n     Although  the defense expert,  Professor Colby, contradicted\n\ncertain of Lydon's testimony, it  was within the district court's\n\nprovince to evaluate what  it heard and make judgments  about the\n\nweight to attribute to each expert's views.  Colby stated that he\n\nsaw  no plant  matter in  the  rock wool  that had  contained the\n\ncuttings.   The court,  however, reasonably could  credit Lydon's\n\ncontrary  testimony in light  of its own ability  to see roots on\n\nmost of the 16 cuttings in Colby's photographs.  Similarly, Colby\n\ntestified that  the growth at  the base  of the cuttings  was not\n\nroots  but simply \"primordia,\" or the precursor of roots to come.\n\nIn   our   view,   the   court   properly   could   reject   this\n\ncharacterization   of  the   growth  because   Colby's  testimony\n\nprimarily focused on when  plants have \"functional root systems,\"\n\nsee Tr. of August 6, at  37, rather than on when the  first stage\n   \n\nof the system manifests.5\n\n                    \n\n5 Colby testified that the \"newly emerging growth\" at the base of\nsome  of  the  cuttings  was  not  \"roots\"  because  it  was  not\nperforming  the function of roots.   Tr. of August  6, at 38.  He\nexplained  that  one  of  the  critical  functions  of  roots  --\nabsorbing water -- requires  root hairs.  The root  hairs develop\non  secondary  roots, which  in turn  are  formed off  of primary\nroots.  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  He further </span><pre class=\"inline\">testified:\n           \n\n                               -12-\n\n     Burke  makes  much  of the  fact  that  both  Lydon and  the\n\ndistrict court acknowledged  that several of the  cuttings in the\n\nphotographs showed no visible signs of roots.   See Tr. of August\n                                                   \n\n12, at 47, 52, 67.  The testimony, however, clearly permitted the\n\ndistrict  court to conclude  that each  of the  similarly healthy\n\nplants in  the videotape must  have had  the same  level of  root\n\ngrowth  as  the  six  to ten  examined  by  Lydon,  and that  the\n\ninability  to see  them  in the  photographs  was the  result  of\n\nfuzziness in the pictures or loss of the roots when  the cuttings\n\nwere pulled from the pots and dried.\n\n     Two  other points  highlighted  by Burke  similarly fail  to\n\nundermine  the  district  court's  finding.    Detective McKinney\n\ntestified that the  cuttings continued to  grow for several  days\n\nfollowing their  seizure,  and Burke  suggests that  it was  only\n\nduring  this time  -- if  at all --  that the  cuttings developed\n\nenough to be  termed plants.   The district  court, however,  was\n\nfree  to   credit  Lydon's  contrary  testimony   that  the  root\n\n                    \n\n     What we're looking for is a root system.   And in order\n     for  a plant  to be  classified as  a fully  functional\n     living  organism . . . it's got to have functional root\n     systems, leaf systems and stem systems.\"  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 38-39.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">                                                  \n\n     In his testimony  on the process  by which cuttings  develop\nroots, Lydon stated that callus tissue first develops in the spot\nwhere roots later will emerge.  Tr.  of August 12, at 34.  In his\nview, when  sufficient tissue  develops  at that  location to  be\ndifferentiated from the stem,  the root system has begun  and the\nspecimen  may be  defined  as  a  \"cutting  with  roots.\"    This\ndescription is consistent with the approach for recognizing roots\nadopted by  the court in Edge  (callus tissue is not  a root, but\n                             \nsmall  \"hair-like  projections\"  are  the  beginning  of  a  root\nsystem).  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603548\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <a href=\"/opinion/603548/united-states-v-dwayne-allen-edge/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">878-79</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">&amp; nn.9, 10.\n             \n\n                               -13-\n\ndevelopment he saw could  not have been achieved in  just several\n\ndays.  See Tr. of August 12, at 16.\n          \n\n     Burke  also  challenges Lydon's  reliance  on  the size  and\n\nhealth  of the leaves to support his conclusion that the cuttings\n\nmust have  had roots.   He notes  that the government  expert was\n\nunable  to  say  unequivocally that  Burke  had  removed  all the\n\npreviously grown  large leaves from the  cuttings before planting\n\nthem  -- the  technique  typically used  by experienced  growers.\n\nBurke's theory is that, if the leaves as viewed in  the videotape\n\nwere on the plants before the replanting, their size would not be\n\nevidence of  functioning roots.   But  Lydon's testimony  was not\n\npremised solely on the  size of the  leaves.  He saw  significant\n\nroot  formation, and primarily relied  on the size  of the leaves\n\nonly for his  conclusion that  the plants he  did not  personally\n\nobserve must have had the same root development.\n\n     Finally,  Burke contends  that, at  the least,  the district\n\ncourt  should have reduced the number  of plants by 10 percent to\n\nreflect the  typical failure  rate of  marijuana cuttings.   This\n\ntheory, adopted by  the court in United States v.  Angell, 794 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp.  874, 876  (D.
