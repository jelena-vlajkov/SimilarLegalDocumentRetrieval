Philip Paul Bassett  seeks review of a\n                    \n\nTax Court  decision  sustaining an  Internal Revenue  Service\n\n(IRS) determination that Bassett  had underpaid his taxes and\n\nwas liable for certain penalties as a result.  The  Tax Court\n\ndecision entered  on January  15, 1993,  but Bassett  did not\n\nfile his notice of appeal until June 11, 1993, well after the\n\nappeal period had expired.  See 26 U.S.C.   7483 (\"Review  of\n                               \n\na decision of  the Tax  Court shall be  obtained by filing  a\n\nnotice  of appeal with  the clerk of the  Tax Court within 90\n\ndays after the decision  of the Tax Court is  entered.\").  In\n\nresponse  to  our order  to show  cause  why his  late appeal\n\nshould proceed, Bassett alleged that he had not been informed\n\nof his appellate rights  or obligations by either the  IRS or\n\nthe Tax Court.  We permitted the appeal to proceed, reserving\n\nthe question  whether we  had jurisdiction over  the untimely\n\nappeal.\n\n          We  now  dismiss  Bassett's  appeal  for  lack   of\n\njurisdiction.  See  Vibro Manufacturing Co.  v. Commissioner,\n                                                            \n\n312 F.2d 253, 254  (2d Cir. 1963) (untimely filing  of appeal\n\ndeprives  the  court  of  appeals  of  jurisdiction  over  an\n\nappeal).   The Tax Court's  failure to notify  Bassett of his\n\nappeal  rights does not excuse the untimely appeal so that we\n\nmay  assume jurisdiction  over  the appeal.    See Wilder  v.\n                                                         \n\nChairman of  the Central Classification Board,  926 F.2d 367,\n                                             \n\n371 n.2 (4th Cir.)

The same would\n\nbe true  of any failure by  the IRS to inform  Bassett of his\n\nappellate rights, assuming, that is, that the IRS had such an\n\nobligation.    \n\n          Appeal dismissed. \n                           \n\n                             -3-\n",
