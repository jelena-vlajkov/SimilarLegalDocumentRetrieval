Plaintiffs/appellees  are\n                                    \n\nWhitney  Brothers Company  (\"Whitney  Brothers\")  and Griffin  M.\n\nStabler, Whitney Brothers' president, chief executive officer and\n\ndirector.   Defendants/appellants,  David C.  Sprafkin  and  Joan\n\nBarenholtz, are the trustees of the Bernard  M. Barenholtz Trust,\n\nWhitney Brothers'  majority  shareholder.    Plaintiffs  sued  to\n\ncompel  defendants  to  sell  their  stock  in  Whitney  Brothers\n\npursuant to a written buy/sell contract.\n\n          After  two  years  of litigation,  the  district  court\n\nordered the sale  at defendants' asking price.  In the order, the\n\ndistrict court also held  that:  (1) plaintiffs were  entitled to\n\nprepay  the promissory note bearing the  sale price; (2) interest\n\nwould begin to accrue  when plaintiffs execute the note;  and (3)\n\nplaintiffs were entitled to attorneys' fees.  Defendants appealed\n\nonly  on  the  issues of  prepayment  and  interest.   Plaintiffs\n\nsubsequently moved for attorneys' fees for this appeal.  W      e\n\nreverse the district court's judgment with respect to prepayment,\n\naffirm  with  respect  to  the  accrual  of  interest,  and  deny\n\nplaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees on this appeal.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Whitney Brothers  is a  New Hampshire corporation  that\n\nproduces wooden learning materials.   Bernard Barenholtz acquired\n\n62.6% of the  company's outstanding  shares in 1969.   Ten  years\n\nlater, he transferred these  shares to the Bernard M.  Barenholtz\n\nTrust  (the  \"Trust\")  and  named  himself  and  defendant  David\n\nSprafkin trustees.   Plaintiff Griffin Stabler owns 32.7%  of the\n\n                               -2-\n\nshares, and his son, David Stabler, owns the remaining 4.7%.\n\n          On January  27, 1987,  Whitney Brothers,  the trustees,\n\nand Griffin Stabler executed a written buy/sell agreement.  Under\n\nthe  agreement, Whitney  Brothers  would buy  the Trust's  shares\n\nwithin ninety days  of the  death of Bernard  Barenholtz and  buy\n\nGriffin Stabler's  shares within ninety days  of Stabler's death.\n\nTo  determine  the  purchase price,  the  parties  would plug  an\n\nagreed-upon appraisal  into a  formula to determine  the purchase\n\nprice.   If  the parties could  not agree  on an  appraisal, they\n\nwould each get their own and  plug the average into the  formula.\n\nThe contract also provided for payment by a promissory note, with\n\nmonthly installments  over ten years  at 10% interest  per annum.\n\nThe  agreement did not mention whether prepayment of the note was\n\npermissible.\n\n          On   February  3,   1987,  Bernard   Barenholtz's  (and\n\ndefendants')  attorney, Samuel  M. Sprafkin  wrote a  letter (the\n\n\"February 3  letter\") advising  Mr. Barenholtz that:   (1)  David\n\nStabler, as  a shareholder, should  consent to the  contract; (2)\n\nthe promissory note should be prepayable without penalty; and (3)\n\nArticle 4 of the contract should have an additional provision not\n\nrelevant to  this appeal.   Plaintiffs contend, and  the district\n\ncourt found,  that after Bernard Barenholtz  received the letter,\n\nthe   parties  orally   agreed  to   the  prepayment   provision.\n\nBarenholtz  then placed  the letter  in a  file with  the written\n\ncontract and David  Stabler signed  an addendum  to the  contract\n\npursuant to Sprafkin's first suggestion.\n\n                               -3-\n\n          When Bernard  Barenholtz died,  on August 5,  1989, his\n\ndaughter,   defendant  Joan   Barenholtz,  assumed   his  trustee\n\nposition.  Whitney Bros. Co. v. Sprafkin, No. 90-054-S, at  4 (D.\n                                        \n\nN.H.  filed Sept. 30, 1992).  A few days later, plaintiff Stabler\n\nand defendant  Sprafkin discussed the  contract's required  stock\n\nsale.  Id.  One of the parties asked E.F. Greene to update a past\n          \n\nappraisal of Whitney Brothers.1  Id.   Sprafkin rejected Greene's\n                                    \n\nappraisal; Whitney  Brothers  accepted  it.    Id.    Relying  on\n                                                  \n\nGreene's  appraisal, Whitney  Brothers tendered  to defendants  a\n\nprepayable  promissory note  for  $1,178,000 for  the stock  (the\n\n\"September 1989 Tender\").2  Id. at 4-5.\n                               \n\n          Instead of responding immediately, defendants secured a\n\nsignificantly  higher appraisal from Alfred  Schimmel.  Id.  They\n                                                           \n\nthen  rejected   Whitney  Brothers'  tender  by  letter,  without\n\nmentioning the note's prepayment clause.  When Stabler learned of\n\ndefendants' appraisal, he rejected it as too high.\n\n          Ultimately, plaintiffs sued  to compel the transfer  of\n\nthe stock.   Ten months later,  on December 13, 1990,  as part of\n\ntheir cross-motion  for summary judgment,  plaintiffs offered  to\n\ntender  either $1,349,3433  immediately  or, if  the court  found\n\nthat the  agreement did not  permit prepayment, that  amount over\n\n                    \n\n1  The parties disagree over who requested the update.\n\n2  Defendants contend  that Stabler made the tender  knowing that\nthey  did not accept Greene's appraisal and planned to obtain one\nof their own.\n\n3  This was  the price calculated under the  contract by plugging\nthe average of the two appraisals into the formula.\n\n                               -4-\n\nten  years   at  10%  interest  (the   \"December  1990  Tender\").\n\nDefendants again rejected the tender.  They now contend that they\n\nrejected it because:   (1) it omitted $145,000 worth  of interest\n\nthat  had accrued since November 3, 1989, 90 days after the death\n\nof Bernard Barenholtz; and  (2) it was invalid because  the first\n\noption  permitted   prepayment,  and   the   second  option   was\n\nconditioned upon a court judgment that prepayment was prohibited.\n\n          In response to the  cross-motions for summary judgment,\n\nthe  district court:  (1) ordered defendants to sell their stock;\n\n(2) found that plaintiffs  were not entitled to prepay  the note;\n\nand  (3) decided  to hold  a trial  on the  issue of  the stock's\n\nprice.   See Whitney Bros.  Co. v. Sprafkin,  No. 90-54-S (D.N.H.\n                                           \n\nfiled June 5, 1991).\n\n          After the trial, the court issued an order in which it:\n\n(1) required  plaintiffs to  pay $1,349,343  for  the stock;  (2)\n\nreconsidered  and reversed,  sua sponte,  its previous  order and\n                                       \n\nruled that plaintiffs could  pay for the stock with  a prepayable\n\npromissory  note; (3) ruled that interest on the note would begin\n\nto accrue when  it was executed, and not before;  and (4) awarded\n\nattorneys'  fees to  plaintiffs  based on  defendants' bad  faith\n\nconduct  of the litigation.   See Whitney Bros.  Co. v. Sprafkin,\n                                                                \n\nNo. 90-054-S  (D. N.H.  filed Sept.  30, 1992).   When  the court\n\nentered judgment on the  order the following day, the  court also\n\nawarded  prejudgment interest  pursuant to  N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.\n\n  524:1-b,  \"if appropriate.\"    Whitney Bros.  Co. v.  Sprafkin,\n                                                                \n\nNo. 1:90-cv-0054-S (D.N.H. filed Oct. 1, 1992) (emphasis added).\n\n                               -5-\n\n          Defendants  appeal  on  only   two  issues:    (1)  the\n\nprepayability of the note;  and (2) the date from  which interest\n\naccrues.   In  addition, plaintiffs  request attorneys'  fees for\n\nthis appeal.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nI.  PREPAYABILITY\n\n          Article 4 of the buy/sell contract provides:\n\n            The purchase  price .  . . shall  be paid\n                                                     \n            with a negotiable  promissory note  which\n                                                     \n            shall  provide  for  the payment  of  the\n                               \n            purchase price in 10 years  with interest\n            at the rate  of 10% per annum,  principal\n            and  interest  payable   in  120   equal,\n            consecutive monthly payments.\n\n(emphasis added).   The agreement nowhere  mentions prepayment of\n\nthe proposed promissory note.\n\n          At  trial,  the  district  court  conditionally allowed\n\nevidence of a subsequent  oral agreement permitting prepayment of\n\nthe note.  Ultimately,  the court admitted the  evidence, finding\n\nthat  it was not  precluded by the  parol evidence rule.   In the\n\nsame  ruling, the court found that the parties indeed entered the\n\nalleged oral agreement.\n\n          The court erred in  finding the asserted oral agreement\n\nbinding  on the  parties.   Article  5  of the  written  buy/sell\n\ncontract prohibits  the parties from orally  altering or amending\n\nthe written contract.4   Under  N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann.    382-A:2-\n\n                    \n\n4  Article 5 provides:\n\n            This agreement may be altered, amended or\n            terminated by a writing signed by all  of\n            the shareholders except David G. Stabler,\n\n                               -6-\n\n209(2),  \"[a] signed  agreement  which  excludes modification  or\n\nrescission  except  by  a  signed  writing  cannot  be  otherwise\n\nmodified or  rescinded. . . .\"   While an  attempted modification\n\ncan constitute a waiver,  that waiver can be retracted  absent \"a\n\nmaterial  change of position in  reliance on that  waiver.\"  N.H.\n\nRev.  Stat. Ann.    382-A:  2-209(4) and  (5).   Here, plaintiffs\n\nallege  no  alteration  of  their  position   in  reliance  on  a\n\nprepayment provision.   Thus, we  can find no  binding waiver  of\n\n                    \n\n            and the Corporation.\n\n   Although the  Article does not  state in mandatory  terms that\nalterations  must  be in  writing,  defendants  argue that  since\n                 \nagreements  may  always be  altered by  a  writing signed  by the\nparties,  the Article  must have  been  intended to  exclude oral\nmodifications.   While we do not foreclose other purposes of this\nclause, we agree that the purport  of the provision is to require\nthat alterations be in writing.\n\n   In addition,  plaintiffs never countered  defendants' argument\nthat the Article precludes oral alterations and amendments to the\ncontract.   In response to this  argument, plaintiffs, apparently\ncharacterizing the clause as  an integration clause, argued that:\n(1) such a clause did not mandate a finding that the contract was\ntotally integrated; (2) the contract was not a total integration;\n(3) the  February  3 letter  \"contemplated  an  extra-contractual\nunderstanding about  a  term of  the  agreement,\" rather  than  a\nvariation;  and   (4)  therefore,   since  the  court   found  an\nindependent  agreement,  the  court   could  find  the  note  was\nprepayable.  This argument ignores defendants' assertion that the\nclause prohibits oral alterations of the contract.\n\n   At  oral  argument,  when  questioned  about the  prohibition,\nplaintiffs' counsel simply argued that the oral agreement was not\na modification  because the contract did  not mention prepayment.\nCounsel  did state  that  Article 5  \"supposedly\" precludes  oral\n                                                \nmodification,   suggesting  a   possible  disagreement   on  that\ninterpretation.   However, since  defendants raised Article  5 at\nthe trial level, see Defendants' Objections to Plaintiffs' Cross-\n                                                                 \nMotion for Summary Judgment  at 11; Defendants' Post  Trial Brief\n                                                                 \nat 44-45,  and on appeal, Appellants' Brief  at 17-19, 21 n.7, we\n                                           \nconstrue plaintiffs' failure  to argue that the Article  does not\nprohibit oral alteration as a concession that it does.\n\n                               -7-\n\nArticle 5 by defendants.5  Plaintiffs  contend   that  since  the\n\nwritten  contract says  nothing  about  prepayment, a  subsequent\n\nagreement to  allow prepayment does not  constitute an alteration\n\nor  amendment under  Article  5.   Rather,  they argue  that  the\n\nagreement was  independent of the written  contract.  Apparently,\n\nthe district court agreed.  Although the court did not explicitly\n\naddress Article 5,  it did conclude  that a prepayment  provision\n\n\"does not,  by its  terms, vary  or contradict  the terms  of the\n\nAgreement. . . .\"   Whitney  Bros.

If plaintiffs prepay the  note, they will avoid\n\npaying  the  10% interest  and  thereby deviate  from  an express\n\nprovision of the contract.  Moreover, 10% interest over ten years\n\namounts to a significant percentage of the contract price.  Since\n\nprepayment  would  substantially  alter  the  parties'  financial\n\npositions under  the contract, an agreement  to permit prepayment\n\nconstitutes an alteration under Article 5.  \n\n          Furthermore, although the  New Hampshire Supreme  Court\n\nhas never  encountered this  precise issue, recent  holdings from\n\nthat court support our  conclusion.  In DeCato Brothers,  Inc. v.\n                                                              \n\nWestinghouse Credit  Corp., 529  A.2d 952,  956 (N.H. 1987),  the\n                          \n\ncourt  stated,   \"generally,   absent  manifest   injustice,   an\n\ninstrument is payable  in full  according to its  tenor, and  the\n\nmaker  has no  right  to  prepay in  the  absence  of an  express\n\nprovision  providing for  prepayment.\"   Later,  in Patterson  v.\n                                                             \n\nTirollo,  133  581  A.2d  74,  77  (N.H.  1990)  (quoting  Fuller\n                                                                 \n\nEnterprises v.  Manchester Sav.  Bank,  152 A.2d  179, 181  (N.H.\n                                     \n\n1959)),  the court  reaffirmed  that \"the  law  is clear  in  New\n\nHampshire that  negotiable instruments  are 'payable at  the time\n\nfixed therein,' and in the absence of an express provision that a\n\nmortgagor  is entitled to prepay  his or her  note, the mortgagor\n\nhas no legal rightto pay the debt inadvance of the maturitydate.\"\n\n                    \n\n7   We  note that  our  analysis would  not change  under a  more\ndeferential  standard of review as we find that the court clearly\nerred in this determination.\n\n                               -9-\n\n          Although these cases  involve actual promissory  notes,\n\nrather  than  agreements to  make  promissory  notes, by  finding\n\nprepayment  precluded  in the  absence  of  a specific  provision\n\nauthorizing it,  the New  Hampshire Supreme Court  demonstrated a\n\nbelief  that prepayment  significantly alters  the rights  of the\n\nparties involved.\n\n          Finally,   plaintiffs'    last-ditch   argument,   that\n\nSprafkin's February  3 letter  constitutes a  sufficient writing,\n\nneeds  little  deliberation.8    Sprafkin  wrote  the  letter  to\n\nBarenholtz.  Thus, it cannot be construed, as plaintiffs propose,\n\nas  a written  offer  which plaintiffs  were  entitled to  accept\n\norally.\n\n          Because Article 5 of the contract precludes plaintiffs'\n\nasserted oral agreement, the district court erred  in finding the\n\nnote prepayable.9\n\nII.  INTEREST\n\n          Defendants next assign  error to  the district  court's\n\n                    \n\n8    Plaintiffs  did  not  make  this  argument  in  response  to\ndefendants'  Article 5  argument.   They made  the argument  as a\nresponse  to defendants'  invocation  of the  statute of  frauds.\nHowever,  we address the issue  to alleviate any  doubts that the\nargument  might   have  assisted  them  against   the  Article  5\nprohibition.\n\n9   Plaintiffs stress on appeal the district court's finding that\nthe parties formed the oral agreement after executing the written\n                                           \ncontract,  and   they   have   not   challenged   this   finding.\nAdditionally, they  specifically argued  to this court  that \"the\nevidence Plaintiffs offered was to prove a subsequent agreement .\n                                                     \n.  .\" (Plaintiffs-Appellees'  Brief at  29).   Thus, we  need not\naddress defendants' alternative arguments that the oral agreement\ncould not bind them  if it had been formed before  or at the time\nof the written contract.\n\n                               -10-\n\ndetermination  that interest  will  not  accrue until  plaintiffs\n\nexecute the promissory note.   They offer two principal arguments\n\nto support this proposition.\n\n          First, defendants find their entitlement to prejudgment\n\ninterest in  N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    524:1-b (1992).   Under that\n\nsection, when a party  wins pecuniary damages, he is  entitled to\n\nprejudgment  interest  on the  award.   Defendants argue  that by\n\nfinding  the  stock's purchase  price  to  be  that advocated  by\n\ndefendants, the court granted them pecuniary damages.  Defendants\n\nwere not awarded pecuniary  damages, however.  Rather, plaintiffs\n\nwere awarded  specific performance of  the contract at  the price\n\nthat the court found stipulated in their cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment.   In its second  order, the district court reconsidered\n\nits summary judgment ruling  and determined that since plaintiffs\n\noffered to pay defendants' advocated price at the time, the court\n\nshould have  ordered the  sale at  that price.   Thus,  the court\n\ngranted  plaintiffs'  cross-motion for  summary  judgment  to the\n\nextent that it sought to  compel defendants to sell the  stock at\n\ndefendants' price.   See Whitney Bros.  Co., No. 90-054-S  (Sept.\n                                           \n\n30,  1992), at 10-11.  Indeed, the court specifically referred to\n\nplaintiffs  as \"prevailing  parties.\"   Id.  at  19.10   Thus,   \n                                           \n\n524:1-b  provides no  basis for  awarding defendants  prejudgment\n\n                    \n\n10  In light of the court's conclusion that the appraisal used to\ncalculate defendants' advocated price lacked  factual foundation,\nsee Whitney Bros. Co., No. 90-054-S (Sept. 30,  1992), at 21, the\n                     \ncourt's  statement that  \"the price of  the securities  . .  . is\n$1,349,343\"  does not convince us that the court believed that to\nbe the price contemplated by the contract.\n\n                               -11-\n\ninterest.11\n\n          Second,  defendants  argue  that  plaintiffs  owe  them\n\ninterest under the written  contract, beginning November 3, 1989,\n\n90 days  after the death  of Bernard Barenholtz.   The theory  is\n\nthat  plaintiffs never made a valid tender within the required 90\n\ndays, and therefore defendants  deserve the interest that accrued\n\nfrom that date.   See Lancaster Development Corp. v.  Kattar, 262\n                                                            \n\nA.2d  278, 280-81 (N.H. 1970) (where plaintiff was ready, willing\n\nand able to perform, and  defendant made faulty tender, plaintiff\n\nwas  not responsible  for interest  accruing from  the contracted\n\ndate of  sale).  Specifically, defendants  claim that plaintiffs'\n\nSeptember  1989 tender  was invalid  because:   (1) the  note was\n\n$170,000 less than the  defendants' advocated purchase price; and\n\n(2) the note contained a prepayment provision.\n\n          We  cannot conclude  that  defendants  are entitled  to\n\ninterest under the agreement based on  the September 1989 tender.\n\nWith respect  to the  purchase price, defendants  failed to  tell\n\nplaintiffs their  requested  price within  the prescribed  ninety\n\ndays.  Moreover, the  district court specifically determined that\n\nthe appraisal on  which their price  was based was so  lacking in\n\n                    \n\n11  Defendants' assertion that the court's judgment which ordered\n\"prejudgment interest pursuant to  NH RSA 524:1-b, if appropriate\n                                                                 \n. . . \" (emphasis  added) was  a judgment for  interest in  their\nfavor that  had to be appealed by plaintiff, lacks merit.  As the\ncourt's  opinion did not indicate  a belief that  it was awarding\ndefendants  damages  by  granting  plaintiffs'  cross-motion  for\nsummary judgment, we cannot construe the court's reference to the\nstatute  as an award of  interest for defendants.   Moreover, the\naward   specifically  ordered   prejudgment   interest  only   if\nappropriate.   As  we explained  above,  such interest  would  be\ninappropriate here.\n\n                               -12-\n\nfactual  foundation that it should not have even been admitted at\n\ntrial.  That plaintiffs later  acquiesced to defendants' price in\n\norder to  end  this  disturbing  litigation does  not  require  a\n\nfinding that they were  wrong to make their initial  offer at the\n\ntime they made it.\n\n          Similarly, although we  found that plaintiffs  were not\n\nentitled  to prepay  the  note, we  are  not convinced  that  the\n\nprepayment provision  of the  September 1989 tender  rendered the\n\ntender faulty  at the time  it was made.   The record  reveals no\n\nevidence  that  defendants complained  of  the  prepayment clause\n\nbefore June 29, 1990, nine months after  the tender.  They cannot\n\nnow claim  that the prepayment  provision in  the September  1989\n\ntender stalled  the sale.   Cf.  Elliott v.  Dew, 212 S.E.2d  421\n                                                \n\n(S.C. 1975) (if defect in  tender not objected to when tender  is\n\nmade, cannot use defect to prevent performance of contract).\n\n          Moreover,  defendants,   consistently  complained  that\n\nWhitney  Brothers could not  afford the purchase.   (The district\n\ncourt  later found that the evidence amply supported a finding to\n\nthe contrary).  Yet,  at the same time, defendants  demanded what\n\nthe district court found to be a trumped-up price.  This suggests\n\nthat  defendants were  attempting  to hamper  the  sale that  the\n\ncontract required.   Thus,  even assuming plaintiffs'  tender was\n\nsomehow  faulty, as defendants were not willing to perform at the\n\ntime,  they are  not  entitled  to  interest.    Cf.  Platsis  v.\n                                                             \n\nDiafokeris,  511 A.2d 535 (Md. App. 1986) (faulty tender does not\n          \n\ntrigger accrual of  interest if clear that only  excessive amount\n\n                               -13-\n\nwould be accepted).\n\n          Finally, as  defendants were  not entitled  to interest\n\nbeginning  November 3, their refusal to  accept the December 1990\n\ntender  because it failed to  include such interest precludes the\n\naccrual  of interest from  that time.   In  addition, defendants'\n\nparenthetical argument  that the December 1990  tender was faulty\n\nbecause it was conditional  also fails.  When the  district court\n\ndetermined  that prepayment  was  prohibited,  the tender  became\n\nunconditional.    Yet,  defendants  still refused  to  accept  it\n\nwithout interest running from November 3.  Again, defendants were\n\nat  no time  willing  to perform.    Accordingly, we  affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's  decision that  interest should begin  to accrue\n\nwhen the note is executed.\n\nIII.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\n\n          As  defendants   won  their  appeal  with   respect  to\n\nprepayment, plaintiffs  are not  entitled to attorneys'  fees for\n\nthat  issue.   In addition,  although defendants'  arguments with\n\nrespect to interest were  unconvincing, we do not find  that they\n\nwent  \"against  the  overwhelming  weight  of  precedent,\"   that\n\ndefendants  \"could   set  forth  no  facts   to  support  [their]\n\nposition,\"  or that  \"there  simply was  no legitimate  basis for\n\npursuing an appeal.\"   See Kowalski v.  Gagne, 914 F.2d 299,  309\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir. 1990).   Accordingly, we  deny plaintiffs'  motion for\n\nattorneys' fees.\n\n          Finally, plaintiffs request a finding that if we affirm\n\nthe district  court's judgment,  defendants may not  appeal their\n\n                               -14-\n\nmotion  under Fed. R.  Civ. P. 59(e)  to alter the  judgment with\n\nrespect to fees.   Plaintiffs  cite no cases  that would  justify\n\nsuch  a finding.   Thus,  we decline  to make  such a  finding or\n\notherwise consider the issue  of the award of attorneys'  fees by\n\nthe district court.\n\n          Affirmed  in  part;  reversed  in  part.

Plaintiffs/appellees  are\n                                    \n\nWhitney  Brothers Company  (\"Whitney  Brothers\")  and Griffin  M.\n\nStabler, Whitney Brothers' president, chief executive officer and\n\ndirector.   Defendants/appellants,  David C.  Sprafkin  and  Joan\n\nBarenholtz, are the trustees of the Bernard  M. Barenholtz Trust,\n\nWhitney Brothers'  majority  shareholder.    Plaintiffs  sued  to\n\ncompel  defendants  to  sell  their  stock  in  Whitney  Brothers\n\npursuant to a written buy/sell contract.\n\n          After  two  years  of litigation,  the  district  court\n\nordered the sale  at defendants' asking price.  In the order, the\n\ndistrict court also held  that:  (1) plaintiffs were  entitled to\n\nprepay  the promissory note bearing the  sale price; (2) interest\n\nwould begin to accrue  when plaintiffs execute the note;  and (3)\n\nplaintiffs were entitled to attorneys' fees.  Defendants appealed\n\nonly  on  the  issues of  prepayment  and  interest.   Plaintiffs\n\nsubsequently moved for attorneys' fees for this appeal.  W      e\n\nreverse the district court's judgment with respect to prepayment,\n\naffirm  with  respect  to  the  accrual  of  interest,  and  deny\n\nplaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees on this appeal.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Whitney Brothers  is a  New Hampshire corporation  that\n\nproduces wooden learning materials.   Bernard Barenholtz acquired\n\n62.6% of the  company's outstanding  shares in 1969.   Ten  years\n\nlater, he transferred these  shares to the Bernard M.  Barenholtz\n\nTrust  (the  \"Trust\")  and  named  himself  and  defendant  David\n\nSprafkin trustees.   Plaintiff Griffin Stabler owns 32.7%  of the\n\n                               -2-\n\nshares, and his son, David Stabler, owns the remaining 4.7%.\n\n          On January  27, 1987,  Whitney Brothers,  the trustees,\n\nand Griffin Stabler executed a written buy/sell agreement.  Under\n\nthe  agreement, Whitney  Brothers  would buy  the Trust's  shares\n\nwithin ninety days  of the  death of Bernard  Barenholtz and  buy\n\nGriffin Stabler's  shares within ninety days  of Stabler's death.\n\nTo  determine  the  purchase price,  the  parties  would plug  an\n\nagreed-upon appraisal  into a  formula to determine  the purchase\n\nprice.   If  the parties could  not agree  on an  appraisal, they\n\nwould each get their own and  plug the average into the  formula.\n\nThe contract also provided for payment by a promissory note, with\n\nmonthly installments  over ten years  at 10% interest  per annum.\n\nThe  agreement did not mention whether prepayment of the note was\n\npermissible.\n\n          On   February  3,   1987,  Bernard   Barenholtz's  (and\n\ndefendants')  attorney, Samuel  M. Sprafkin  wrote a  letter (the\n\n\"February 3  letter\") advising  Mr. Barenholtz that:   (1)  David\n\nStabler, as  a shareholder, should  consent to the  contract; (2)\n\nthe promissory note should be prepayable without penalty; and (3)\n\nArticle 4 of the contract should have an additional provision not\n\nrelevant to  this appeal.   Plaintiffs contend, and  the district\n\ncourt found,  that after Bernard Barenholtz  received the letter,\n\nthe   parties  orally   agreed  to   the  prepayment   provision.\n\nBarenholtz  then placed  the letter  in a  file with  the written\n\ncontract and David  Stabler signed  an addendum  to the  contract\n\npursuant to Sprafkin's first suggestion.\n\n                               -3-\n\n          When Bernard  Barenholtz died,  on August 5,  1989, his\n\ndaughter,   defendant  Joan   Barenholtz,  assumed   his  trustee\n\nposition.

PREPAYABILITY\n\n          Article 4 of the buy/sell contract provides:\n\n            The purchase  price .  . . shall  be paid\n                                                     \n            with a negotiable  promissory note  which\n                                                     \n            shall  provide  for  the payment  of  the\n                               \n            purchase price in 10 years  with interest\n            at the rate  of 10% per annum,  principal\n            and  interest  payable   in  120   equal,\n            consecutive monthly payments.\n\n(emphasis added).   The agreement nowhere  mentions prepayment of\n\nthe proposed promissory note.\n\n          At  trial,  the  district  court  conditionally allowed\n\nevidence of a subsequent  oral agreement permitting prepayment of\n\nthe note.  Ultimately,  the court admitted the  evidence, finding\n\nthat  it was not  precluded by the  parol evidence rule.   In the\n\nsame  ruling, the court found that the parties indeed entered the\n\nalleged oral agreement.\n\n          The court erred in  finding the asserted oral agreement\n\nbinding  on the  parties.   Article  5  of the  written  buy/sell\n\ncontract prohibits  the parties from orally  altering or amending\n\nthe written contract.4   Under  N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann.    382-A:2-\n\n                    \n\n4  Article 5 provides:\n\n            This agreement may be altered, amended or\n            terminated by a writing signed by all  of\n            the shareholders except David G. Stabler,\n\n                               -6-\n\n209(2),  \"[a] signed  agreement  which  excludes modification  or\n\nrescission  except  by  a  signed  writing  cannot  be  otherwise\n\nmodified or  rescinded. . . .\"   While an  attempted modification\n\ncan constitute a waiver,  that waiver can be retracted  absent \"a\n\nmaterial  change of position in  reliance on that  waiver.\"  N.H.\n\nRev.  Stat. Ann.    382-A:  2-209(4) and  (5).   Here, plaintiffs\n\nallege  no  alteration  of  their  position   in  reliance  on  a\n\nprepayment provision.   Thus, we  can find no  binding waiver  of\n\n                    \n\n            and the Corporation.\n\n   Although the  Article does not  state in mandatory  terms that\nalterations  must  be in  writing,  defendants  argue that  since\n                 \nagreements  may  always be  altered by  a  writing signed  by the\nparties,  the Article  must have  been  intended to  exclude oral\nmodifications.   While we do not foreclose other purposes of this\nclause, we agree that the purport  of the provision is to require\nthat alterations be in writing.\n\n   In addition,  plaintiffs never countered  defendants' argument\nthat the Article precludes oral alterations and amendments to the\ncontract.   In response to this  argument, plaintiffs, apparently\ncharacterizing the clause as  an integration clause, argued that:\n(1) such a clause did not mandate a finding that the contract was\ntotally integrated; (2) the contract was not a total integration;\n(3) the  February  3 letter  \"contemplated  an  extra-contractual\nunderstanding about  a  term of  the  agreement,\" rather  than  a\nvariation;  and   (4)  therefore,   since  the  court   found  an\nindependent  agreement,  the  court   could  find  the  note  was\nprepayable.  This argument ignores defendants' assertion that the\nclause prohibits oral alterations of the contract.\n\n   At  oral  argument,  when  questioned  about the  prohibition,\nplaintiffs' counsel simply argued that the oral agreement was not\na modification  because the contract did  not mention prepayment.\nCounsel  did state  that  Article 5  \"supposedly\" precludes  oral\n                                                \nmodification,   suggesting  a   possible  disagreement   on  that\ninterpretation.   However, since  defendants raised Article  5 at\nthe trial level, see Defendants' Objections to Plaintiffs' Cross-\n                                                                 \nMotion for Summary Judgment  at 11; Defendants' Post  Trial Brief\n                                                                 \nat 44-45,  and on appeal, Appellants' Brief  at 17-19, 21 n.7, we\n                                           \nconstrue plaintiffs' failure  to argue that the Article  does not\nprohibit oral alteration as a concession that it does.\n\n                               -7-\n\nArticle 5 by defendants.5  Plaintiffs  contend   that  since  the\n\nwritten  contract says  nothing  about  prepayment, a  subsequent\n\nagreement to  allow prepayment does not  constitute an alteration\n\nor  amendment under  Article  5.   Rather,  they argue  that  the\n\nagreement was  independent of the written  contract.  Apparently,\n\nthe district court agreed.  Although the court did not explicitly\n\naddress Article 5,  it did conclude  that a prepayment  provision\n\n\"does not,  by its  terms, vary  or contradict  the terms  of the\n\nAgreement. . . .\"   Whitney  Bros.

If plaintiffs prepay the  note, they will avoid\n\npaying  the  10% interest  and  thereby deviate  from  an express\n\nprovision of the contract.  Moreover, 10% interest over ten years\n\namounts to a significant percentage of the contract price.  Since\n\nprepayment  would  substantially  alter  the  parties'  financial\n\npositions under  the contract, an agreement  to permit prepayment\n\nconstitutes an alteration under Article 5.  \n\n          Furthermore, although the  New Hampshire Supreme  Court\n\nhas never  encountered this  precise issue, recent  holdings from\n\nthat court support our  conclusion.

Thus, it cannot be construed, as plaintiffs propose,\n\nas  a written  offer  which plaintiffs  were  entitled to  accept\n\norally.\n\n          Because Article 5 of the contract precludes plaintiffs'\n\nasserted oral agreement, the district court erred  in finding the\n\nnote prepayable.9\n\nII.  INTEREST\n\n          Defendants next assign  error to  the district  court's\n\n                    \n\n8    Plaintiffs  did  not  make  this  argument  in  response  to\ndefendants'  Article 5  argument.   They made  the argument  as a\nresponse  to defendants'  invocation  of the  statute of  frauds.\nHowever,  we address the issue  to alleviate any  doubts that the\nargument  might   have  assisted  them  against   the  Article  5\nprohibition.\n\n9   Plaintiffs stress on appeal the district court's finding that\nthe parties formed the oral agreement after executing the written\n                                           \ncontract,  and   they   have   not   challenged   this   finding.\nAdditionally, they  specifically argued  to this court  that \"the\nevidence Plaintiffs offered was to prove a subsequent agreement .\n                                                     \n.  .\" (Plaintiffs-Appellees'  Brief at  29).   Thus, we  need not\naddress defendants' alternative arguments that the oral agreement\ncould not bind them  if it had been formed before  or at the time\nof the written contract.\n\n                               -10-\n\ndetermination  that interest  will  not  accrue until  plaintiffs\n\nexecute the promissory note.   They offer two principal arguments\n\nto support this proposition.\n\n          First, defendants find their entitlement to prejudgment\n\ninterest in  N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.    524:1-b (1992).   Under that\n\nsection, when a party  wins pecuniary damages, he is  entitled to\n\nprejudgment  interest  on the  award.   Defendants argue  that by\n\nfinding  the  stock's purchase  price  to  be  that advocated  by\n\ndefendants, the court granted them pecuniary damages.  Defendants\n\nwere not awarded pecuniary  damages, however.  Rather, plaintiffs\n\nwere awarded  specific performance of  the contract at  the price\n\nthat the court found stipulated in their cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment.   In its second  order, the district court reconsidered\n\nits summary judgment ruling  and determined that since plaintiffs\n\noffered to pay defendants' advocated price at the time, the court\n\nshould have  ordered the  sale at  that price.   Thus,  the court\n\ngranted  plaintiffs'  cross-motion for  summary  judgment  to the\n\nextent that it sought to  compel defendants to sell the  stock at\n\ndefendants' price.   See Whitney Bros.  Co., No. 90-054-S  (Sept.\n                                           \n\n30,  1992), at 10-11.

Co., No. 90-054-S (Sept. 30,  1992), at 21, the\n                     \ncourt's  statement that  \"the price of  the securities  . .  . is\n$1,349,343\"  does not convince us that the court believed that to\nbe the price contemplated by the contract.\n\n                               -11-\n\ninterest.11\n\n          Second,  defendants  argue  that  plaintiffs  owe  them\n\ninterest under the written  contract, beginning November 3, 1989,\n\n90 days  after the death  of Bernard Barenholtz.   The theory  is\n\nthat  plaintiffs never made a valid tender within the required 90\n\ndays, and therefore defendants  deserve the interest that accrued\n\nfrom that date.

Kattar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">278</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280-81 (N.H. 1970) (where plaintiff was ready, willing\n\nand able to perform, and  defendant made faulty tender, plaintiff\n\nwas  not responsible  for interest  accruing from  the contracted\n\ndate of  sale).  Specifically, defendants  claim that plaintiffs'\n\nSeptember  1989 tender  was invalid  because:   (1) the  note was\n\n$170,000 less than the  defendants' advocated purchase price; and\n\n(2) the note contained a prepayment provision.\n\n          We  cannot conclude  that  defendants  are entitled  to\n\ninterest under the agreement based on  the September 1989 tender.\n\nWith respect  to the  purchase price, defendants  failed to  tell\n\nplaintiffs their  requested  price within  the prescribed  ninety\n\ndays.  Moreover, the  district court specifically determined that\n\nthe appraisal on  which their price  was based was so  lacking in\n\n                    \n\n11  Defendants' assertion that the court's judgment which ordered\n\"prejudgment interest pursuant to  NH RSA 524:1-b, if appropriate\n                                                                 \n. . . \" (emphasis  added) was  a judgment for  interest in  their\nfavor that  had to be appealed by plaintiff, lacks merit.  As the\ncourt's  opinion did not indicate  a belief that  it was awarding\ndefendants  damages  by  granting  plaintiffs'  cross-motion  for\nsummary judgment, we cannot construe the court's reference to the\nstatute  as an award of  interest for defendants.   Moreover, the\naward   specifically  ordered   prejudgment   interest  only   if\nappropriate.   As  we explained  above,  such interest  would  be\ninappropriate here.\n\n                               -12-\n\nfactual  foundation that it should not have even been admitted at\n\ntrial.  That plaintiffs later  acquiesced to defendants' price in\n\norder to  end  this  disturbing  litigation does  not  require  a\n\nfinding that they were  wrong to make their initial  offer at the\n\ntime they made it.\n\n          Similarly, although we  found that plaintiffs  were not\n\nentitled  to prepay  the  note, we  are  not convinced  that  the\n\nprepayment provision  of the  September 1989 tender  rendered the\n\ntender faulty  at the time  it was made.   The record  reveals no\n\nevidence  that  defendants complained  of  the  prepayment clause\n\nbefore June 29, 1990, nine months after  the tender.  They cannot\n\nnow claim  that the prepayment  provision in  the September  1989\n\ntender stalled  the sale.   Cf.  Elliott v.  Dew, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1371239\"><a href=\"/opinion/1371239/elliott-v-dew/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">421</span>\n</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">                                                \n\n(S.C. 1975) (if defect in  tender not objected to when tender  is\n\nmade, cannot use defect to prevent performance of contract).\n\n          Moreover,  defendants,   consistently  complained  that\n\nWhitney  Brothers could not  afford the purchase.   (The district\n\ncourt  later found that the evidence amply supported a finding to\n\nthe contrary).  Yet,  at the same time, defendants  demanded what\n\nthe district court found to be a trumped-up price.  This suggests\n\nthat  defendants were  attempting  to hamper  the  sale that  the\n\ncontract required.   Thus,  even assuming plaintiffs'  tender was\n\nsomehow  faulty, as defendants were not willing to perform at the\n\ntime,  they are  not  entitled  to  interest.    Cf.  Platsis  v.\n                                                             \n\nDiafokeris,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1520183\"><a href=\"/opinion/1520183/platsis-v-diafokeris/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(Md. App. 1986) (faulty tender does not\n          \n\ntrigger accrual of  interest if clear that only  excessive amount\n\n                               -13-\n\nwould be accepted).\n\n          Finally, as  defendants were  not entitled  to interest\n\nbeginning  November 3, their refusal to  accept the December 1990\n\ntender  because it failed to  include such interest precludes the\n\naccrual  of interest from  that time.   In  addition, defendants'\n\nparenthetical argument  that the December 1990  tender was faulty\n\nbecause it was conditional  also fails.  When the  district court\n\ndetermined  that prepayment  was  prohibited,  the tender  became\n\nunconditional.    Yet,  defendants  still refused  to  accept  it\n\nwithout interest running from November 3.  Again, defendants were\n\nat  no time  willing  to perform.    Accordingly, we  affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's  decision that  interest should begin  to accrue\n\nwhen the note is executed.\n\nIII.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\n\n          As  defendants   won  their  appeal  with   respect  to\n\nprepayment, plaintiffs  are not  entitled to attorneys'  fees for\n\nthat  issue.   In addition,  although defendants'  arguments with\n\nrespect to interest were  unconvincing, we do not find  that they\n\nwent  \"against  the  overwhelming  weight  of  precedent,\"   that\n\ndefendants  \"could   set  forth  no  facts   to  support  [their]\n\nposition,\"  or that  \"there  simply was  no legitimate  basis for\n\npursuing an appeal.\"   See Kowalski v.

Accordingly, we  deny plaintiffs'  motion for\n\nattorneys' fees.\n\n          Finally, plaintiffs request a finding that if we affirm\n\nthe district  court's judgment,  defendants may not  appeal their\n\n                               -14-\n\nmotion  under Fed.
