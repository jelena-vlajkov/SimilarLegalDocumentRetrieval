McGaughey, Assistant  United  States Attorney,\n                            \nwith whom Jay P.

Appellant Michael Nason was\n                                   \n\ncharged with conspiracy  to distribute marijuana in  violation of\n\n21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1) &amp;  846  and possession  of marijuana  in\n\nviolation  of 21  U.S.C.    844(a).   Following  a  trial in  the\n\ndistrict  court, the  jury found  him guilty  as charged.   Nason\n\nrequests that this  court reverse his  conviction and remand  his\n\ncase for  a new  trial.  On  appeal, Nason  argues that:  (1) the\n\ntrial  court erred  in denying  his motion  for severance  of his\n\ntrial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14; (2) this\n\nerror deprived him  of the ability to  confront and cross-examine\n\nhis codefendants in violation of his Sixth Amendment  rights; (3)\n\nthe trial court's  instructions regarding conspiracy  constituted\n\nreversible  error;  (4)  the  trial  court  erred  regarding  the\n\nadmission  of  certain   pieces  of  evidence  seized;   (5)  the\n\ncumulative  effect   of  the  trial  court's  errors  constituted\n\nprejudicial error depriving him of  due process and a fair trial;\n\nand (6) the pursuit of appellant for the purpose of incriminating\n\nhim violated his due process rights.  Finding appellant's  claims\n\nto be without merit, we affirm.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The government charged  Michael Nason, Ellen  Finch and\n\nDavid  Finch  with  conspiracy  to  distribute  marijuana.1    In\n\naddition,  the   government  alleged  that  Nason   conspired  to\n\ndistribute marijuana with   numerous other  persons who were  not\n\nindicted.      The  Maine   Drug   Enforcement   Agency  (\"MDEA\")\n\n                    \n\n1  The jury acquitted Ellen and David Finch of these charges.\n\n                               -2-\n\ninvestigation that lead to Nason's conviction focused on Room 332\n\nof the Scottish Inn Motel in Bangor, Maine.\n\n          Between  May  23   and  May  29,  1992,  Room  332  was\n\nregistered   to   Nason's  girlfriend,   Merry  Lane.     Shortly\n\nthereafter, a desk clerk  added Nason's name to the  registration\n\ncard so that  his calls  could be  directed to the  room.   Nason\n\nsubsequently  received telephone calls  in Room 332  and supplies\n\nwere delivered  by  the motel  maid to  him in  Room  332.   Many\n\nindividuals  visited Room  332,  staying  for  only five  to  ten\n\nminutes, and a black Cadillac was  observed in front of the room.\n\nThe police were notified of this suspicious behavior.\n\n          When officers reviewed  the motel's telephone  records,\n\nthey  found that  the  occupants  of Room  332  were calling  the\n\ntelephone numbers of known  drug dealers.  Officers then  decided\n\nto establish surveillance of the motel room and Nason.  As a part\n\nof the investigation,  the government enlisted the  assistance of\n\ndrug trafficker Gabriel Zappia in  exchange for a plea agreement.\n\nZappia asked  his friend,  Gilbert  Shubert, to  arrange for  the\n\npurchase  of marijuana  from  Nason.   In  response to  Shubert's\n\nrequest, Nason  contacted  a  supplier  in order  to  obtain  the\n\nmarijuana.\n\n          Nason arranged to sell Zappia the marijuana  on May 27,\n\n1992.  Nason, Shubert and Zappia went to pick up the marijuana in\n\nZappia's car.   Because Nason suspected police  surveillance, and\n\nZappia feared that  the police would not observe  the transaction\n\nas previously  planned, the two  postponed the sale.   During the\n\n                               -3-\n\ninterim, Shubert began to cooperate with the police.\n\n          Shubert and  Nason met at the  Ramada Inn on May  28 to\n\ncomplete the  drug transaction.   Nason told Shubert that  he had\n\n\"the dope\"  and that he would call his supplier who would deliver\n\nit.  Nason said that if he had not been serious he would not have\n\nbrought  along white  garbage bags.    As they  were leaving  the\n\nRamada Inn, the  two men were arrested.   At the time  of arrest,\n\nNason possessed two  white garbage bags, a  package of marijuana,\n\nand $980 in cash.\n\n          Nason  had  arrived  at  the  Ramada  Inn  in  a  black\n\nCadillac.  After  he got out of  the Cadillac, the driver  of the\n\ncar drove  to the Howard  Johnson's nearby and parked  facing the\n\nRamada Inn.   When Nason  was arrested,  the driver of  the black\n\nCadillac attempted to back out of the motel and ran into a police\n\ncar.  David  and Ellen  Finch were  in the Cadillac.   Both  were\n\narrested.\n\n          Nason had been at Room 332  on May 26 and again on  May\n\n28,  shortly before his arrest.  Inside  the room, police found a\n\nsuitcase containing  a duffel  bag with  marijuana residue  and a\n\nphoto album with  Nason's name on it.   Other items found  in the\n\nroom included  scales, two  sandwich  bags containing  marijuana,\n\nempty  sandwich  bags,  a  programmable  police  scanner,  and  a\n\ncardboard  box with  Nason's  name on  it  containing papers  and\n\nphotographs.\n\n                  DENIAL OF MOTION FOR SEVERANCE\n                                                \n\n          The decision to order severance  of a trial pursuant to\n\n                               -4-\n\nFederal  Rule of  Criminal Procedure  14 is  a matter  within the\n\ndiscretion of  the trial court.   United States v.  Sabatino, 943\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  94, 96 (1st Cir. 1991).  We  reverse the decision to deny a\n\nmotion  for severance only  upon a  showing of  strong prejudice,\n\ndemonstrating  a manifest abuse  of discretion that  deprived the\n\ndefendant of a fair trial.  United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1300, 1304 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Pursuant to  Federal Rule  of Criminal Procedure  8(b),\n\ndefendants may  be tried  together \"if they  are alleged  to have\n\nparticipated in the same act or transaction or in the same series\n\nof  acts or transactions,  constituting an offense  or offenses.\"\n\nSee   Sabatino,  943  F.2d  at   96  (quoting  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nSutherland, 929 F.2d 765, 778  (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 116\n                                                            \n\nL.Ed.2d 56  (1991)).  In this case,  Nason, David Finch and Ellen\n\nFinch  were  alleged  to  have  participated  in  the  same  acts\n\nconstituting the offenses,  hence, they were properly  joined for\n\ntrial.   Where  a defendant  requests a  severance to  secure the\n\ntestimony of a codefendant, he must comply with the  requirements\n\nset forth  in United States v. Drougas, 748  F.2d 8, 19 (1st Cir.\n                                      \n\n1984):\n\n            the movant must  demonstrate: (1) a  bona\n            fide need  for  the  testimony;  (2)  the\n            substance  of  the   testimony;  (3)  its\n            exculpatory  nature and  effect; and  (4)\n            that  the   co-defendant  will   in  fact\n            testify if the cases are severed . . . .\n\n              Given such a showing, the court  should\n            (1)  examine  the   significance  of  the\n            testimony in relation  to the defendant's\n            theory of  defense; (2)  consider whether\n            the   testimony  would   be  subject   to\n\n                               -5-\n\n            substantial  damaging   impeachment;  (3)\n            assess the counter  arguments of judicial\n            economy;  and  (4)  give  weight  to  the\n            timeliness of the motion.\n\nId. at 19; see  also United States v. Font-Ram rez,  944 F.2d 42,\n                                                  \n\n45 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 117 L.Ed.2d 122 (1992).\n                                \n\n          Nason alleged  that his co-defendants, Ellen  and David\n\nFinch,  would testify  that  there was  no  conspiracy among  the\n\nthree.     Standing  alone,   however,  such  an   allegation  is\n\ninsufficient to entitle the defendant  to a severance.  Nason did\n\nnot show, as  required, that either David or Ellen Finch would in\n\nfact testify for Nason at  a separate trial.  He did  not file an\n\naffidavit  from  either David  or  Ellen  to  that effect.    See\n                                                                 \n\nDrougas,  748 F.2d at 19; see also  Font-Ram rez, 944 F.2d at 45.\n                                                \n\nNor did  counsel for  the Finchs represent  that either  David or\n\nEllen Finch  would testify for  Nason at a  separate trial.   See\n                                                                 \n\nDeLuna,  763 F.2d  at  920 (counsel  for co-defendant  stating in\n                                                                 \n\ncamera that  client  would  testify if  trials  were  severed  is\n      \n\nsufficient to  show  that co-defendant  is likely  to testify).  \n\nFurthermore, Nason did  not show, as required,   that the Finchs'\n\ntestimony would exculpate  him.   United States  v. Perkins,  926\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 1271, 1281 (1st Cir.  1991) (citing United States v. DeLuna,\n                                                                \n\n763 F.2d 897,  920 (8th Cir.  1985), cert.  denied, 474 U.S.  980\n                                                  \n\n(1985)); see also Font-Ram rez, 944  F.2d at 45 (denial of motion\n                              \n\nfor severance was not an abuse of discretion where co-defendant's\n\naffidavit in support of the  motion did not provide the substance\n\nof  the testimony  and  did  not explain  why  the testimony  was\n\nnecessary   or  beneficial  to   the  defense).     The  evidence\n\n                               -6-\n\ndemonstrated that Nason  conspired with a number  of people other\n\nthan  David  and  Ellen  Finch.    Other  potential  conspirators\n\nincluded  Shubert,  Merry  Lane,  and  the  supplier  whom  Nason\n\ncontacted.   Thus,  even without  a finding  of a  conspiratorial\n\nagreement with  the Finchs,  the government  still  had a  strong\n\nconspiracy case against Nason.   This conclusion is  evident from\n\nthe outcome of the  joint trial, as the jury acquitted both Ellen\n\nand David Finch yet convicted Nason of conspiracy.\n\n          Since Nason did  not make the preliminary  showing that\n\nencompasses the first four factors  of the severance test set out\n\nin Drougas, we  need not examine whether the  other criteria were\n          \n\nmet.  We  therefore hold that the  judge below did not  abuse his\n\ndiscretion in denying Nason's motion for severance.\n\n                   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n                                              \n\n          On appeal,  we look at  the evidence in the  light most\n\nfavorable to  the prosecution.   United States  v. Sabatino,  943\n                                                           \n\nF.2d at 97 (citing  United  States v. MacDonald &amp; Watson Oil Co.,\n                                                                \n\n933  F.2d  35, 40  (1st   Cir.  1991)).   We draw  all legitimate\n\ninferences and resolve all credibility  conflicts in favor of the\n\nprosecution.  Id.   We will uphold the verdict  if any reasonable\n                 \n\ntrier of fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.  Id. (citing United States v.  Mena, 933 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n19, 23 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\n          Nason   argues  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  not\n\ndismissing  the  charges   against  him  at  the  close   of  the\n\ngovernment's case due  to insufficient evidence.   In essence, he\n\n                               -7-\n\nargues  that the  evidence of  conspiracy  is inadequate  because\n\nthere was  no second  person who conspired  with Nason  to either\n\ndistribute or  possess marijuana.   The  record does not  support\n\nthis argument.\n\n          A defendant can be  indicted and convicted even if  the\n\nnames  of  his  co-conspirators  are  unknown,  as  long  as  the\n\ngovernment  presents evidence of an agreement between two or more\n\npersons.    United States v. Rey,  923 F.2d 1217, 1222  (6th Cir.\n                                \n\n1991); see  also United  States v.  Pe agar cano-Soler, 911  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n833, 840 n.5 (1st Cir. 1990).  The essence of a conspiracy is the\n\nexistence of the conspiracy agreement, not the identity  of those\n\nwho agree.  Rey, 923 F.2d at 1222 (citations omitted).\n               \n\n          At trial, sufficient evidence was presented from  which\n\na jury could  conclude that a conspiracy existed.   Testimony was\n\ngiven about other persons with whom the jury could have concluded\n\nthat Nason entered an agreement to violate the law. These include\n\nNason's girlfriend, Merry Lane, who  rented the room that was the\n\nfocus  of  the  drug  activity  and in  which  the  agents  found\n\nmarijuana;  Shubert, a potential drug purchaser who later decided\n\nto cooperate  with the police;  and Nason's  drug supplier,  whom\n\nNason telephoned to arrange the  drug transaction.  The jury also\n\ncould have found that the  unknown occupants of several cars, who\n\nentered  Room 332,  were co-conspirators.   See United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nMoree, 897 F.2d 1329, 1332 (5th Cir. 1990) (evidence of agreement\n     \n\nwith  unnamed contacts, among others, was sufficient evidence for\n\nconspiracy conviction as government produced sufficient  evidence\n\n                               -8-\n\nto form a rational basis for the jury's adjudications).\n\n                      SIXTH AMENDMENT CLAIMS\n                                            \n\n          Nason argues that testimony  by government agent Antone\n\nbased  on his interview  of codefendant Ellen  Finch violated his\n\nright  of cross-examination and Sixth Amendment right to confront\n\nwitnesses against him because Nason  was not able to confront and\n\ncross-examine Ellen Finch.

She gave Nason a second  pen because\n\nthe first one did  not work.  She did not see  Nason write on the\n\npaper.  When questioned about a piece of paper found in  her car,\n\nshe indicated that the writing on the paper was not hers and that\n\n                               -9-\n\nshe did not know whose it was.  \n\n          There  was no  confrontation clause  violation.   Ellen\n\nFinch's  statements to Agent Antone  did not have the \"powerfully\n\nincriminating  effect  of  one  accomplice  pointing  the  finger\n\ndirectly  at  another,  without  subjecting  [her]self to  cross-\n\nexamination,\"  amounting to  a violation of the  Sixth Amendment.\n\nUnited  States v.  Barnett, 989  F.2d 546,  558 (1st  Cir. 1993),\n                          \n\ncert. denied, 62  U.S.L.W. 33247 (1993) (internal  quotations and\n            \n\ncitations omitted);   see also Bruton v.

Hence, we find no  plain error in admission of\n\nthe testimony by  Agent Antone regarding the note  found in Ellen\n\nFinch's car.\n\n          Nason further  argues that the  introduction, over  his\n\nobjection, of  testimony of MDEA agent Daryl Crandale, that Ellen\n\nFinch had told him  that she knew Nason had been  in trouble with\n\ndrugs before, also  deprived him of his Sixth  Amendment right to\n\nconfrontation.  We find this argument to be without merit.\n\n          Following the testimony of Agent Crandale, the district\n\ncourt  promptly gave  a limiting  instruction  that confined  the\n\njury's  consideration of that evidence to  Ellen Finch's state of\n\nmind.     This  court  has  previously  indicated  that  limiting\n\ninstructions  provide an  adequate safeguard  against evidentiary\n\nspill-over.   United States v.

In  any event,  any  error in  admitting Ellen's\n\nstatement was  harmless.  See  Manocchio v.

Other evidence in\n\nthe  record included recorded conversations between Nason and the\n\nundercover informant in which Nason boasts about his twenty years\n\nof drug  dealings and  freedom from arrests.   This  evidence was\n\nsubstantially more damaging to Nason than was Ellen's comment.\n\n                        JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n                                         \n\n          By failing to object to the jury instructions after the\n\ncharge was given,  Nason waived any such objections.

United  States v. Newton, 891  F.2d 944, 949 (1st  Cir.\n                                  \n\n1989).  In describing the  elements of a conspiracy, the district\n\ncourt told the jury:\n\n            you must be convinced that the government\n            has proved  .  . .  beyond  a  reasonable\n            doubt  .   .  .   the  existence   of  an\n            agreement.  The government must show that\n            some time  between May 21, 1992,  and May\n            28, 1992, the agreement  specified in the\n            indictment, and not  some other agreement\n            or agreements,  existed between  at least\n            two  people,  not   including  government\n            agents, to commit  the enumerated federal\n            crime.  This does not have to be a formal\n            agreement or plan  in which everyone  who\n            is involved sat down together and  worked\n            out the details.   It is enough  that the\n            government  prove  beyond   a  reasonable\n            doubt that  there was a  common agreement\n            among those  who were involved  to commit\n            the crime of distributing marijuana . . .\n            .\n\n              It is not  necessary to  find that  the\n            individual defendants agreed specifically\n            to or knew  about all the details  of the\n            crime, but the government must prove that\n            the   defendants   knew   the   essential\n            features  and  the  general aims  of  the\n            venture . . . .\n\n              [T]he government must prove . . . there\n            was  an agreement to commit the crime . .\n            .  and that  the defendant  intentionally\n            joined in that agreement.\n\n          The  court's  instructions  substantially  covered  the\n\n                               -12-\n\nlegal  concepts requested by Nason in his proposed instructions.2\n\nHaving covered the necessary and requested principles of law, the\n\ndistrict court did not err.\n\n          Nason also requested an instruction  on withdrawal from\n\na conspiracy.3   A defendant  is entitled to instructions  on his\n\ntheory of  defense if  he produces some  evidence to  support all\n\n                    \n\n2  Nason's first two proposed instructions were as follows:\n\n            #1. As  it takes  two to  conspire, there\n            can be  no conspiracy  with a  government\n            informer   who   secretly    intends   to\n            frustrate the conspiracy.

Any conspiracy  \"agreement\" must  be\n            complete.  There  must exist proof beyond\n            a reasonable doubt  that there existed  a\n            \"meeting  of   the  minds\"   between  the\n            defendant and an  alleged co-conspirator.\n            The   jury   must  consider   whether   a\n            Defendant's    insistence   on    certain\n            conditions    precedent,   where    those\n            conditions are unacceptable to his would-\n            be co-conspirators, prevented  a \"meeting\n            of  the   minds\"  so  that   no  complete\n            agreement  existed.

An  alleged conspirator  may withdraw\n            from  membership  in   the  conspiracy.  \n            There  must   exist  evidence   that  the\n            Defendant  abandoned,  withdrew  from, or\n            disavowed the conspiracy  or defeated its\n            purpose.  Once evidence of withdrawal has\n            been  presented,   the  government   must\n            disprove withdrawal  beyond a  reasonable\n            doubt.  Hyde  v.

In order to withdraw, a conspirator must:\n\n            act  affirmatively  either to  defeat  or\n            disavow the  purposes of  the conspiracy.\n            Typically, there must  be evidence either\n            of a full confession  to authorities or a\n            communication by the  accused to his  co-\n            conspirators  that he  has abandoned  the\n            enterprise and its goals.\n\nUnited States  v.

This court has held that \"[m]ere  cessation\n\nof activity in furtherance of  [a] conspiracy does not constitute\n\nwithdrawal.\"   Juodakis, 834  F.2d at  1102 (citations  omitted).\n                       \n\nNason's refusal to agree to Shubert's proposed terms of the sale,\n\nafter which he got up and left the Ramada Inn, is  not sufficient\n\nevidence of withdrawal to require an instruction on that defense.\n\nThus,  we find  that the  trial court's  refusal to  give Nason's\n\nproposed  instruction  on  withdrawal did  not  constitute  plain\n\nerror.\n\n                        EVIDENTIARY ISSUES\n                                          \n\n          Appellant   argues  that  the   trial  court  erred  in\n\nadmitting into evidence items such as scales, bags,  and baggies,\n\nseized from Room 332 of the Scottish Inn, which was registered to\n\nhis girlfriend, Merry Lane.  He argues that there was no evidence\n\nthat  he  occupied  Room  332  and  that  the  evidence  was  not\n\nsufficiently linked to  Nason to make its  admission permissible.\n\nIn essence, he  argues that the admission into  evidence of items\n\nseized from  Room 332 was  irrelevant, highly prejudicial  and in\n\n                               -14-\n\nviolation of Rule 403 of the Rules of Evidence.\n\n          The threshold for  relevance is very low  under Federal\n\nRule of  Evidence 401.

Nason's name  was noted  on the\n\nregistration card to the motel  room so that incoming calls could\n\n                    \n\n4  Fed. R.

In fact, a number of people called Nason at\n\nthe motel room.  Nason  gave Shubert the motel's telephone number\n\nas a place to reach him and Shubert called Nason at  the motel to\n\ndiscuss Nason's interest in reviving the deal.  Nason was seen at\n\nRoom 332 by the maid, two custodians, the owner of the motel, and\n\nthe  police officers who  photographed him.   Furthermore, inside\n\nthe room,  inside  a suitcase,  beside  a duffle  bag  containing\n\nmarijuana residue,  was an  album that  contained photographs  of\n\nNason  and had  Nason's name  written on it.   The  above factors\n\nindicated that Nason had been in  the room with the marijuana and\n\nmade the evidence found in the room relevant to his participation\n\nin  a  conspiracy.    The objects  found  in  Room  332 are  also\n\nprobative of the conspirators' intent to distribute marijuana and\n\nwere not likely to suggest a decision on an improper basis to the\n\njury.  Although  the evidence may be damaging to Nason's case, it\n\nis  not  unfairly  prejudicial.    See  Rey,  923  F.2d  at  1222\n                                           \n\n(admission  of  electronic  equipment   and  books  not  unfairly\n\nprejudicial in  trial for drug  charge).

First,  he argues  that, by\n\ntargeting him for investigation,  law enforcement agents violated\n\nhis due process rights.  This court has previously ruled that:\n\n            arguments not seasonably addressed to the\n            trial  court may  not be  raised  for the\n            first time in an appellate  venue . . . .\n            A criminal  defendant, dissatisfied  with\n\n                               -16-\n\n            the district  court's rulings  . . .  yet\n            persuaded  that  his  original  arguments\n            lacked merit,  cannot switch  horses mid-\n            stream  in hopes  of  locating a  swifter\n            steed.\n\nSee United  States v.

See United States  v. Price,  990 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1367 (D.C.

Nason requests that this court reverse his conviction and remand his case for a new trial.  On appeal, Nason argues that:  (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion for severance of his trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14;  (2) this error deprived him of the ability to confront and cross-examine his codefendants in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights;  (3) the trial court's instructions regarding conspiracy constituted reversible error;  (4) the trial court erred regarding the admission of certain pieces of evidence seized;  (5) the cumulative effect of the trial court's errors constituted prejudicial error depriving him of due process and a fair trial;  and (6) the pursuit of appellant for the purpose of incriminating him violated his due process rights.  Finding appellant's claims to be without merit, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government charged Michael Nason, Ellen Finch and David Finch with conspiracy to distribute marijuana.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In addition, the government alleged that Nason conspired to distribute marijuana with numerous other persons who were not indicted.  The Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") investigation that lead to Nason's conviction focused on Room 332 of the Scottish Inn Motel in Bangor, Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between May 23 and May 29, 1992, Room 332 was registered to Nason's girlfriend, Merry Lane.  Shortly thereafter, a desk clerk added Nason's name to the registration card so that his calls could be directed to the room.  Nason subsequently received telephone calls in Room 332 and supplies were delivered by the motel maid to him in Room 332.  Many individuals visited Room 332, staying for only five to ten minutes, and a black Cadillac was observed in front of the room.  The police were notified of this suspicious behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When officers reviewed the motel's telephone records, they found that the occupants of Room 332 were calling the telephone numbers of known drug dealers.  Officers then decided to establish surveillance of the motel room and Nason.  As a part of the investigation, the government enlisted the assistance of drug trafficker Gabriel Zappia in exchange for a plea agreement.  Zappia asked his friend, Gilbert Shubert, to arrange for the purchase of marijuana from Nason.  In response to Shubert's request, Nason contacted a supplier in order to obtain the marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason arranged to sell Zappia the marijuana on May 27, 1992.  Nason, Shubert and Zappia went to pick up the marijuana in Zappia's car.  Because Nason suspected police surveillance, and Zappia feared that the police would not observe the transaction as previously planned, the two postponed the sale.  During the interim, Shubert began to cooperate with the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shubert and Nason met at the Ramada Inn on May 28 to complete the drug transaction.  Nason told Shubert that he had \"the dope\" and that he would call his supplier who would deliver it.  Nason said that if he had not been serious he would not have brought along white garbage bags.  As they were leaving the Ramada Inn, the two men were arrested.  At the time of arrest, Nason possessed two white garbage bags, a package of marijuana, and $980 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason had arrived at the Ramada Inn in a black Cadillac.  After he got out of the Cadillac, the driver of the car drove to the Howard Johnson's nearby and parked facing the Ramada Inn.  When Nason was arrested, the driver of the black Cadillac attempted to back out of the motel and ran into a police car.  David and Ellen Finch were in the Cadillac.  Both were arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason had been at Room 332 on May 26 and again on May 28, shortly before his arrest.  Inside the room, police found a suitcase containing a duffel bag with marijuana residue and a photo album with Nason's name on it.  Other items found in the room included scales, two sandwich bags containing marijuana, empty sandwich bags, a programmable police scanner, and a cardboard box with Nason's name on it containing papers and photographs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DENIAL OF MOTION FOR SEVERANCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to order severance of a trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.  United States v. Sabatino, 943 F.2d 94, 96 (1st Cir.1991).  We reverse the decision to deny a motion for severance only upon a showing of strong prejudice, demonstrating a manifest abuse of discretion that deprived the defendant of a fair trial.  United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1304 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(b), defendants may be tried together \"if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions, constituting an offense or offenses.\"   See Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 96 (quoting United States v. Sutherland, 929 F.2d 765, 778 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 83, 116 L.Ed.2d 56 (1991)).  In this case, Nason, David Finch and Ellen Finch were alleged to have participated in the same acts constituting the offenses, hence, they were properly joined for trial.  Where a defendant requests a severance to secure the testimony of a codefendant, he must comply with the requirements set forth in United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 19 (1st Cir.1984):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>the movant must demonstrate:  (1) a bona fide need for the testimony;  (2) the substance of the testimony;  (3) its exculpatory nature and effect;  and (4) that the co-defendant will in fact testify if the cases are severed....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given such a showing, the court should (1) examine the significance of the testimony in relation to the defendant's theory of defense;  (2) consider whether the testimony would be subject to substantial damaging impeachment;  (3) assess the counter arguments of judicial economy;  and (4) give weight to the timeliness of the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 19;  see also United States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 45 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 954, 117 L.Ed.2d 122 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason alleged that his co-defendants, Ellen and David Finch, would testify that there was no conspiracy among the three.  Standing alone, however, such an allegation is insufficient to entitle the defendant to a severance.  Nason did not show, as required, that either David or Ellen Finch would in fact testify for Nason at a separate trial.  He did not file an affidavit from either David or Ellen to that effect.  See Drougas, 748 F.2d at 19;  see also Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 45.   Nor did counsel for the Finchs represent that either David or Ellen Finch would testify for Nason at a separate trial.  See United States v. DeLuna, 763 F.2d 897, 920 (8th Cir.1985) (counsel for co-defendant stating in camera that client would testify if trials were severed is sufficient to show that co-defendant is likely to testify).  Furthermore, Nason did not show, as required, that the Finchs' testimony would exculpate him.  United States v. Perkins, 926 F.2d 1271, 1281 (1st Cir.1991) (citing United States v. DeLuna, 763 F.2d 897, 920 (8th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 980, 106 S.Ct. 382, 88 L.Ed.2d 336 (1985));  see also Font- Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 45 (denial of motion for severance was not an abuse of discretion where co-defendant's affidavit in support of the motion did not provide the substance of the testimony and did not explain why the testimony was necessary or beneficial to the defense).  The evidence demonstrated that Nason conspired with a number of people other than David and Ellen Finch.  Other potential conspirators included Shubert, Merry Lane, and the supplier whom Nason contacted.  Thus, even without a finding of a conspiratorial agreement with the Finchs, the government still had a strong conspiracy case against Nason.  This conclusion is evident from the outcome of the joint trial, as the jury acquitted both Ellen and David Finch yet convicted Nason of conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Nason did not make the preliminary showing that encompasses the first four factors of the severance test set out in Drougas, we need not examine whether the other criteria were met.  We therefore hold that the judge below did not abuse his discretion in denying Nason's motion for severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.  United States v. Sabatino, 943 F.2d at 97 (citing United States v. MacDonald &amp; Watson Waste Oil Co., 933 F.2d 35, 40 (1st Cir.1991)).  We draw all legitimate inferences and resolve all credibility conflicts in favor of the prosecution.  Id.  We will uphold the verdict if any reasonable trier of fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id. (citing United States v. Mena, 933 F.2d 19, 23 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason argues that the trial court erred in not dismissing the charges against him at the close of the government's case due to insufficient evidence.  In essence, he argues that the evidence of conspiracy is inadequate because there was no second person who conspired with Nason to either distribute or possess marijuana.  The record does not support this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant can be indicted and convicted even if the names of his co-conspirators are unknown, as long as the government presents evidence of an agreement between two or more persons.  United States v. Rey, 923 F.2d 1217, 1222 (6th Cir.1991);  see also United States v. Penagaricano-Soler, 911 F.2d 833, 840 n. 5 (1st Cir.1990).  The essence of a conspiracy is the existence of the conspiracy agreement, not the identity of those who agree.  Rey, 923 F.2d at 1222 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, sufficient evidence was presented from which a jury could conclude that a conspiracy existed.  Testimony was given about other persons with whom the jury could have concluded that Nason entered an agreement to violate the law.  These include Nason's girlfriend, Merry Lane, who rented the room that was the focus of the drug activity and in which the agents found marijuana;  Shubert, a potential drug purchaser who later decided to cooperate with the police;  and Nason's drug supplier, whom Nason telephoned to arrange the drug transaction.  The jury also could have found that the unknown occupants of several cars, who entered Room 332, were co-conspirators.  See United States v. Moree, 897 F.2d 1329, 1332 (5th Cir.1990) (evidence of agreement with unnamed contacts, among others, was sufficient evidence for conspiracy conviction as government produced sufficient evidence to form a rational basis for the jury's adjudications).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SIXTH AMENDMENT CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason argues that testimony by government agent Antone based on his interview of codefendant Ellen Finch violated his right of cross-examination and Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him because Nason was not able to confront and cross-examine Ellen Finch.  U.S. Const. amend.  VI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Antone's testimony concerned a note, purportedly written by Nason, that was found in the Finchs' car at the time of the arrests.  Nason failed to object when Agent Antone testified about the note.  In the absence of a timely objection our review is limited to examining the record for plain error, and we will \"correct only 'particularly egregious errors' ... that 'seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"  United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (quoting United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1592, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982));  United States v. Munson, 819 F.2d 337, 340 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Antone's testimony was based on his post arrest interview of Ellen Finch during which she indicated that when she and her husband drove Nason to the Ramada Inn, she gave Nason a piece of paper and a pen.  She gave Nason a second pen because the first one did not work.  She did not see Nason write on the paper.  When questioned about a piece of paper found in her car, she indicated that the writing on the paper was not hers and that she did not know whose it was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no confrontation clause violation.  Ellen Finch's statements to Agent Antone did not have the \"powerfully incriminating effect of one accomplice pointing the finger directly at another, without subjecting [her]self to cross-examination,\" amounting to a violation of the Sixth Amendment.  United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 558 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 148, 149, 126 L.Ed.2d 110 (1993) (internal quotations and citations omitted);  see also Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 1627, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).  Hence, we find no plain error in admission of the testimony by Agent Antone regarding the note found in Ellen Finch's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason further argues that the introduction, over his objection, of testimony of MDEA agent Daryl Crandale, that Ellen Finch had told him that she knew Nason had been in trouble with drugs before, also deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.  We find this argument to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the testimony of Agent Crandale, the district court promptly gave a limiting instruction that confined the jury's consideration of that evidence to Ellen Finch's state of mind.  This court has previously indicated that limiting instructions provide an adequate safeguard against evidentiary spill-over.  United States v. Doherty, 867 F.2d 47, 63 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 918, 109 S.Ct. 3243, 106 L.Ed.2d 590 (1989) (citing Drougas, 748 F.2d at 13).   In any event, any error in admitting Ellen's statement was harmless.  See Manocchio v. Moran, 919 F.2d 770, 783-84 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 1695, 114 L.Ed.2d 89 (1991) (subjecting material which creates Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause problems to harmless error analysis).  Other evidence in the record included recorded conversations between Nason and the undercover informant in which Nason boasts about his twenty years of drug dealings and freedom from arrests.  This evidence was substantially more damaging to Nason than was Ellen's comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By failing to object to the jury instructions after the charge was given, Nason waived any such objections.  Wartski v. Bedford, 926 F.2d 11, 22 (1st Cir.1991).  Although Nason filed requests to charge before trial began and noted objections at the chambers conference regarding the court's proposed instruction, he did not object to the instructions after the charge was given.  An objection noted in chambers before delivery does not preserve for review issues relating to the charge.  United States v. Mendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1991).  Where a party has failed to preserve a claim for error by proper objection below, this court will review the issue on appeal only for plain error.  United States v. McMahon, 938 F.2d 1501, 1510 (1st Cir.1991).  Thus, reversal will follow only in \"exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844, 108 S.Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed.2d 94 (1987) (quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held that the failure to give a requested jury instruction is reversible error only if the requested instruction is substantially correct, was not substantially covered in the charge actually given, and covers an important point in the trial so that the failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant's ability to present a given defense.  United States v. Newton, 891 F.2d 944, 949 (1st Cir.1989).  In describing the elements of a conspiracy, the district court told the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>you must be convinced that the government has proved ... beyond a reasonable doubt ... the existence of an agreement.  The government must show that some time between May 21, 1992, and May 28, 1992, the agreement specified in the indictment, and not some other agreement or agreements, existed between at least two people, not including government agents, to commit the enumerated federal crime.  This does not have to be a formal agreement or plan in which everyone who is involved sat down together and worked out the details.  It is enough that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a common agreement among those who were involved to commit the crime of distributing marijuana....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not necessary to find that the individual defendants agreed specifically to or knew about all the details of the crime, but the government must prove that the defendants knew the essential features and the general aims of the venture....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he government must prove ... there was an agreement to commit the crime ... and that the defendant intentionally joined in that agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's instructions substantially covered the legal concepts requested by Nason in his proposed instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Having covered the necessary and requested principles of law, the district court did not err.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason also requested an instruction on withdrawal from a conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  A defendant is entitled to instructions on his theory of defense if he produces some evidence to support all elements of his theory.  See United States v. Panet-Collazo, 960 F.2d 256, 259 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 220, 121 L.Ed.2d 158 (1992).  In order to withdraw, a conspirator must:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>act affirmatively either to defeat or disavow the purposes of the conspiracy.

Juodakis, 834 F.2d 1099, 1102 (1st Cir.1987) (citations omitted).  This court has held that \"[m]ere cessation of activity in furtherance of [a] conspiracy does not constitute withdrawal.\"  Juodakis, 834 F.2d at 1102 (citations omitted).  Nason's refusal to agree to Shubert's proposed terms of the sale, after which he got up and left the Ramada Inn, is not sufficient evidence of withdrawal to require an instruction on that defense.  Thus, we find that the trial court's refusal to give Nason's proposed instruction on withdrawal did not constitute plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>EVIDENTIARY ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence items such as scales, bags, and baggies, seized from Room 332 of the Scottish Inn, which was registered to his girlfriend, Merry Lane.  He argues that there was no evidence that he occupied Room 332 and that the evidence was not sufficiently linked to Nason to make its admission permissible.

Evidence is relevant under Rule 401 if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 401.  Even where evidence is relevant, Rule 403 permits the district court, in its discretion, to exclude evidence where the \"probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 403,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> see also United States v.

Nason's name was noted on the registration card to the motel room so that incoming calls could be directed to him.  In fact, a number of people called Nason at the motel room.  Nason gave Shubert the motel's telephone number as a place to reach him and Shubert called Nason at the motel to discuss Nason's interest in reviving the deal.  Nason was seen at Room 332 by the maid, two custodians, the owner of the motel, and the police officers who photographed him.  Furthermore, inside the room, inside a suitcase, beside a duffle bag containing marijuana residue, was an album that contained photographs of Nason and had Nason's name written on it.  The above factors indicated that Nason had been in the room with the marijuana and made the evidence found in the room relevant to his participation in a conspiracy.  The objects found in Room 332 are also probative of the conspirators' intent to distribute marijuana and were not likely to suggest a decision on an improper basis to the jury.  Although the evidence may be damaging to Nason's case, it is not unfairly prejudicial.  See Rey, 923 F.2d at 1222 (admission of electronic equipment and books not unfairly prejudicial in trial for drug charge).  The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>MISCELLANEOUS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant raises two further arguments that were not raised before the district court.

Nason requests that this court reverse his conviction and remand his case for a new trial.  On appeal, Nason argues that:  (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion for severance of his trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14;  (2) this error deprived him of the ability to confront and cross-examine his codefendants in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights;  (3) the trial court's instructions regarding conspiracy constituted reversible error;  (4) the trial court erred regarding the admission of certain pieces of evidence seized;  (5) the cumulative effect of the trial court's errors constituted prejudicial error depriving him of due process and a fair trial;  and (6) the pursuit of appellant for the purpose of incriminating him violated his due process rights.  Finding appellant's claims to be without merit, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government charged Michael Nason, Ellen Finch and David Finch with conspiracy to distribute marijuana.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In addition, the government alleged that Nason conspired to distribute marijuana with numerous other persons who were not indicted.  The Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") investigation that lead to Nason's conviction focused on Room 332 of the Scottish Inn Motel in Bangor, Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between May 23 and May 29, 1992, Room 332 was registered to Nason's girlfriend, Merry Lane.  Shortly thereafter, a desk clerk added Nason's name to the registration card so that his calls could be directed to the room.  Nason subsequently received telephone calls in Room 332 and supplies were delivered by the motel maid to him in Room 332.  Many individuals visited Room 332, staying for only five to ten minutes, and a black Cadillac was observed in front of the room.  The police were notified of this suspicious behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When officers reviewed the motel's telephone records, they found that the occupants of Room 332 were calling the telephone numbers of known drug dealers.  Officers then decided to establish surveillance of the motel room and Nason.  As a part of the investigation, the government enlisted the assistance of drug trafficker Gabriel Zappia in exchange for a plea agreement.  Zappia asked his friend, Gilbert Shubert, to arrange for the purchase of marijuana from Nason.  In response to Shubert's request, Nason contacted a supplier in order to obtain the marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason arranged to sell Zappia the marijuana on May 27, 1992.  Nason, Shubert and Zappia went to pick up the marijuana in Zappia's car.  Because Nason suspected police surveillance, and Zappia feared that the police would not observe the transaction as previously planned, the two postponed the sale.  During the interim, Shubert began to cooperate with the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shubert and Nason met at the Ramada Inn on May 28 to complete the drug transaction.  Nason told Shubert that he had \"the dope\" and that he would call his supplier who would deliver it.  Nason said that if he had not been serious he would not have brought along white garbage bags.  As they were leaving the Ramada Inn, the two men were arrested.  At the time of arrest, Nason possessed two white garbage bags, a package of marijuana, and $980 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason had arrived at the Ramada Inn in a black Cadillac.  After he got out of the Cadillac, the driver of the car drove to the Howard Johnson's nearby and parked facing the Ramada Inn.  When Nason was arrested, the driver of the black Cadillac attempted to back out of the motel and ran into a police car.  David and Ellen Finch were in the Cadillac.  Both were arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nason had been at Room 332 on May 26 and again on May 28, shortly before his arrest.  Inside the room, police found a suitcase containing a duffel bag with marijuana residue and a photo album with Nason's name on it.  Other items found in the room included scales, two sandwich bags containing marijuana, empty sandwich bags, a programmable police scanner, and a cardboard box with Nason's name on it containing papers and photographs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DENIAL OF MOTION FOR SEVERANCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to order severance of a trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.

The evidence demonstrated that Nason conspired with a number of people other than David and Ellen Finch.  Other potential conspirators included Shubert, Merry Lane, and the supplier whom Nason contacted.  Thus, even without a finding of a conspiratorial agreement with the Finchs, the government still had a strong conspiracy case against Nason.

Nason's name was noted on the registration card to the motel room so that incoming calls could be directed to him.  In fact, a number of people called Nason at the motel room.  Nason gave Shubert the motel's telephone number as a place to reach him and Shubert called Nason at the motel to discuss Nason's interest in reviving the deal.  Nason was seen at Room 332 by the maid, two custodians, the owner of the motel, and the police officers who photographed him.  Furthermore, inside the room, inside a suitcase, beside a duffle bag containing marijuana residue, was an album that contained photographs of Nason and had Nason's name written on it.  The above factors indicated that Nason had been in the room with the marijuana and made the evidence found in the room relevant to his participation in a conspiracy.  The objects found in Room 332 are also probative of the conspirators' intent to distribute marijuana and were not likely to suggest a decision on an improper basis to the jury.

Any conspiracy \"agreement\" must be complete.  There must exist proof beyond a reasonable doubt that there existed a \"meeting of the minds\" between the defendant and an alleged co-conspirator.  The jury must consider whether a Defendant's insistence on certain conditions precedent, where those conditions are unacceptable to his would-be co-conspirators, prevented a \"meeting of the minds\" so that no complete agreement existed.

An alleged conspirator may withdraw from membership in the conspiracy.  There must exist evidence that the Defendant abandoned, withdrew from, or disavowed the conspiracy or defeated its purpose.  Once evidence of withdrawal has been presented, the government must disprove withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt.  Hyde v.
