We affirm.\n\n                               I.\n                                 \n\n                           Background\n                                     \n\n          Appellant  is   a  financial  analyst  who  has  been\n\nemployed by the  Government Development Bank, an agency  of the\n\nCommonwealth  of Puerto  Rico, since  1965.   On June  6, 1989,\n\nappellant received a letter  from Emilio Pena-Fonseca, a senior\n\nvice  president  of the  bank, telling  him  that he  was under\n\ninvestigation   for  alleged   illegalities   related  to   the\n\nperformance of  his  official  duties.1    Shortly  thereafter,\n\nappellant appeared at an  administrative hearing and denied the\n\ncharges.  No other action was taken in this time frame.\n\n          On  September 20, the Commonwealth preferred criminal\n\ncharges against  appellant, alleging that he  had committed the\n\nfelony of  undue influence.2   Following his  arrest, appellant\n\n                   \n\n    1All  dates  mentioned  in   this  opinion  describe  events\noccurring in 1989 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n    2The anti-corruption  statute under which Morris was charged\nprovides in pertinent part:\n\n         Every  person  who  obtains  or  attempts  to\n         obtain  from another any  benefit by claiming\n         or  pretending that  he is  in a  position to\n         influence,  in  any  way,  the conduct  of  a\n         public  official or employee  with respect to\n         the  exercise  of  his  functions,  shall  be\n         punished [as provided by law].\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33,   4364 (1983).\n\n                               2\n\nreceived  a letter  from  Ramon Canter-Frau,  president of  the\n\nbank,  suspending him  from his  post with  pay \"until  further\n\nnotice.\"  This letter bore  a date of October 9, and  appellant\n\ndoes not deny that he received it on that day.\n\n          On  October 26,  appellant's prospects  brightened; a\n\ncommonwealth court  found no  probable cause and  dismissed the\n\npending criminal  charges.   Buoyed by this  victory, appellant\n\nwrote a letter to the bank's board of directors inquiring about\n\nthe status of his suspension.  The chairman of the board, Ramon\n\nGarcia  Santiago  (Garcia), acknowledged  appellant's  query by\n\nletter dated November  27.  Garcia informed  appellant that the\n\nsuspension constituted a temporary measure that would remain in\n\neffect  pending  the completion  of  an internal  investigation\n\nbeing  conducted by the  bank.   Garcia's letter  further noted\n\nthat  there had not yet been any \"final decision\" that could be\n\nappealed to the board of directors.\n\n          On December  26,  appellant received  another  letter\n\nfrom  Canter-Frau.   This missive  notified appellant  that two\n\ninternal charges had been lodged against him and offered him an\n\nopportunity to defend himself in respect to these charges at an\n\nadministrative  hearing.   The  letter  stated  that a  failure\n\nadequately  to refute  the  charges could  lead to  appellant's\n\ndischarge.\n\n          Just under a year later, appellant filed suit against\n\nthe bank and various  bank officials, including Garcia, Canter-\n\nFrau, and Pena-Fonseca.   Invoking 42 U.S.C.    1983, appellant\n\n                               3\n\nclaimed that the defendants had suspended him based on his race\n\nand political  beliefs, thus violating  his civil rights.   The\n\ndefendants denied the accusations and, in due season, moved for\n\nsummary  judgment.  They contended,  inter alia, that the suit,\n                                               \n\nwhich had been commenced on December 21, 1990, was time-barred.\n\nThe motion was referred  to a magistrate judge who  recommended\n\ngranting it.   The  district court honored  the recommendation.\n\nMorris now appeals.\n\n                              II.\n                                 \n\n                  Applicable Legal Principles\n                                             \n\n                               A.\n                                 \n\n                 The Summary Judgment Standard\n                                              \n\n          Summary  judgment  is  appropriate  when  the  record\n\nreflects \"no  genuine issue as to  any material fact and  . . .\n\nthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   \"In this context, `genuine' means that\n\nthe  evidence about  the fact  is such  that a  reasonable jury\n\ncould resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party. . . .\"\n\nUnited  States  v.

By like token, \"`material'  means that the fact is  one\n\nthat might affect the  outcome of the suit under  the governing\n\nlaw.\"  Id. (quoting  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,  477 U.S.\n                                                    \n\n242, 248 (1986)).\n\n          Appellate  review  of   an  order  granting   summary\n\njudgment  is plenary.  See  Pagano v. Frank,  983 F.2d 343, 347\n                                           \n\n                               4\n\n(1st  Cir. 1993);  Rivera-Muriente v.  Agosto-Alicea, 959  F.2d\n                                                    \n\n349,  352 (1st  Cir. 1992).   In  undertaking such  review, the\n\ncourt of appeals must scrutinize the summary judgment record in\n\nthe light  most  amiable  to the  party  opposing  the  motion,\n\nindulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.  See\n                                                               \n\nPagano,  983 F.2d at 347;  Griggs-Ryan v. Smith,  904 F.2d 112,\n                                               \n\n115 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          Notwithstanding the liberality of this  standard, the\n\nnonmovant cannot simply rest  on perfervid rhetoric and unsworn\n\nallegations.  When, for example, defendants invoke Rule 56  and\n\nidentify a fatal  flaw in  a plaintiff's case,  it becomes  the\n\nplaintiff's  burden  to  produce  specific  facts,  in suitable\n\nevidentiary  form,  to  contradict  the  flaw's  existence  and\n\nthereby  establish the presence  of a  trialworthy issue.   See\n                                                               \n\nRivera-Muriente,  959 F.2d at 352.   If the  plaintiff fails to\n               \n\nshoulder this burden, then the court  may adjudicate the motion\n\nas a matter of law.\n\n          In an  appropriate case, Rule  56 can be  employed to\n\ndetermine  the applicability  of  a  statutory  time bar  to  a\n\nparticular set of  facts.  See  id.; see also Jensen  v. Frank,\n                                                              \n\n912 F.2d 517, 520 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                               B.\n                                 \n\n                     The Limitations Period\n                                           \n\n          Local  law  determines  the  limitations  period  for\n\nsection 1983 claims.  See  Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261,  269\n                                           \n\n(1985).     As  a  general  rule,  federal  courts  borrow  the\n\n                               5\n\nlimitations period  for personal injury actions  and apply that\n\nperiod to  section 1983 claims.   See  id. at 276.   In  Puerto\n                                          \n\nRico, the applicable  limita- tions  period is one  year.   See\n                                                               \n\nP.R.

See Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353; Street v. Vose,\n                                                              \n\n936 F.2d 38,  40 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied,  112 S. Ct. 948\n                                              \n\n(1992).    Under the  federal  rule, accrual  commences  when a\n\nplaintiff knows, or has reason  to know, of the  discriminatory\n\nact  that  underpins  his cause  of  action.    See Chardon  v.\n                                                           \n\nFernandez, 454 U.S. 6, 8 (1981); Delaware State Coll. v. Ricks,\n                                                              \n\n449 U.S. 250, 258 (1980); Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353.\n                                         \n\n                              III.\n                                  \n\n                            Analysis\n                                    \n\n          The  issue on  appeal is  whether the  district court\n\nappropriately  entered summary  judgment  on  the  ground  that\n\nappellant sued  beyond the one-year limitations  period.  Since\n\nappellant  commenced  his  action  on December  21,  1990,  our\n\ninquiry reduces to whether  appellant's cause of action accrued\n\nmore  than one year before  that date.   The defendants contend\n\nthat  the October  9 letter,  which  notified appellant  of the\n\n                               6\n\nsuspension, sufficed to wind the limitations clock and start it\n\nticking.   Appellant  contends that  he was  not on  sufficient\n\nnotice of  his predicament until  he received  the December  26\n\nletter, and  that the clock  did not begin  to tick until  that\n\nmoment.   The district  court found that  the defendants' clock\n\nkept better, more accurate time.  We agree.\n\n          The rule in an employment discrimination case is that\n\nthe limitations period begins to run when the claimant receives\n\nunambiguous and authoritative notice  of the discriminatory act\n\n(which is another way of saying  that the period begins to  run\n\nwhen  the employee  learns of  the adverse  employment action).\n\nSee Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d  at 353 (holding that unequivocal\n                   \n\nnotice of the adverse employment action is all that is required\n\nto trigger the limitations period) (collecting cases); see also\n                                                               \n\nSheldon H. Nahmod, Civil  Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation\n                                                               \n\n  9.05  at 265 (3d ed.  1991) (\"[I]t is only  necessary for the\n\nplaintiff in an employment situation to be effectively notified\n\nof a discharge for the cause of action to accrue at the time of\n\nnotification.\").  Thus, the key question to be answered here is\n\ntemporal:   at what juncture did appellant reliably know of the\n\ninjury to which this lawsuit relates?  See Rivera-Muriente, 959\n                                                          \n\nF.2d at 353.  In answering this question, the critical datum is\n\nthe  point in time  at which the  discriminatory act occurred.3\n\n                   \n\n    3We  believe it is vital  to this inquiry  that appellant is\nonly contesting his suspension.   The bank never  discharged him,\nand, in fact, appellant's counsel reported at oral  argument that\nthe bank eventually cleared him of all charges and reinstated him\nin his  position.   Moreover, appellant  received his salary  and\n\n                               7\n\nSee Ricks, 449 U.S. at 258.\n         \n\n          We think that the October  9 letter speaks for itself\n\n   and its tones  are stentorian.  That  letter stated in plain\n\nterms  that the bank had  suspended appellant indefinitely.  It\n\nprovided ample and unequivocal notice of the adverse employment\n\naction.  The  terms and  conditions of the  suspension did  not\n\nvary  in any way from  that moment forward.   Consequently, the\n\nlimitations  clock began  to tick  when appellant  received the\n\nletter.\n\n          We reject appellant's asseveration that the letter of\n\nDecember 26, rather  than the  letter of October  9, marks  the\n\nbeginning  of the  limitations  period.   The later  letter did\n\nnothing  more   than  provide   notice  to  appellant   of  the\n\ncontinuance  of  his suspension.    Hence,  this letter,  which\n\nsignifies a  particularly painful point in  the process because\n\nit advises appellant,  presumably for  the first  time, of  the\n\npossibility  that he might be cashiered, had no effect upon the\n\nrunning of the  limitations period.   After all,  the point  in\n\ntime at which  the consequences  of the act  become hardest  to\n\nbear   which may or may not coincide with the occurrence of the\n\nact  itself    has  no relevance  for  purposes of  framing the\n\nlimitations period.  See Chardon, 454 U.S. at 8; Ricks 449 U.S.\n                                                      \n\nat 258.\n\n          Appellant has another string  to his bow   but  it is\n\nbadly  frayed.    This  initiative  rests on  the  notion  that\n\n                   \n\nbenefits throughout the period of his suspension.\n\n                               8\n\nappellant's  claim did  not accrue  until he  knew of  both the\n                                                           \n\nsuspension and the defendants' discriminatory animus.  Stated a\n\ndifferent  way, appellant  contends  that his  cause of  action\n\nexisted in what amounts to a state of suspended animation until\n\nhe  became aware of the racial and political motives behind the\n\nadverse  employment  decision.    We  cannot  countenance  this\n\ncontention.\n\n          It  is by  now well  established that,  in employment\n\ndiscrimination actions,  limitations periods normally  start to\n\nrun when the  employer's decision is  made and communicated  to\n\nthe affected employee.   See Ricks, 449  U.S. at 261; see  also\n                                                               \n\nMuniz-Cabrero v.

By October 9,  appellant had learned\n\nauthoritatively of his suspension.   He knew the  stated reason\n\nfor  it and could  assess its legitimacy.   He knew  how he had\n\nconducted himself  while on  official business.

Appellant had sufficient  information in\n\nOctober  to enable him to  bring a discrimination claim against\n\nthe bank.4\n\n          At the expense of  carting coal to Newcastle, we  add\n\ntwo  final comments.    First,  we  note  that  the  rules  for\n\nprescription  of  employment  discrimination  actions  are  not\n\ninflexible.    In a  proper  case,  the doctrine  of  equitable\n\ntolling ensures fundamental fairness.  See, e.g.,  Rivera-Gomez\n                                                               \n\nv. de  Castro, 843 F.2d 631,  633-36 (1st Cir. 1988).   In this\n             \n\ninstance, however,  appellant, though  hinting at the  possible\n\n                   \n\n    4Of  course,  it might  be argued  that  a subtle  change in\ncircumstances occurred  on November  27, when appellant,  for the\nfirst time, learned  that his  suspension did not  rise and  fall\nwith the outcome of the criminal  charges.  But appellant has not\ncited November 27 as the trigger date, and, moreover, appellant's\nsuit, measured from  that date, would still be out  of time.  For\nthese reasons, it would  serve no useful purpose to  explore this\npossibility.\n\n                               10\n\napplicability  of equitable  tolling,  has  neither  explicitly\n\nclaimed the doctrine's benefit  nor demonstrated an entitlement\n\nto it.   Any such argument is, therefore, waived.   See Ryan v.\n                                                            \n\nRoyal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990) (ruling \"that\n              \n\nissues  adverted   to  on  appeal  in   a  perfunctory  manner,\n\nunaccompanied  by some  developed argumentation, are  deemed to\n\nhave been abandoned\"); United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir.)

To\n\nprevail on such a  claim, an employee must prove not  only that\n\nhe was unaware of the employer's discriminatory animus but also\n\nthat the employer actively  misled him, to his detriment.   See\n                                                               \n\nJensen, 912 F.2d at 521.   There is no evidence in  the instant\n      \n\nrecord  to suggest  either  misleading  conduct or  detrimental\n\nreliance.\n\n          Second, we  think that deviating from  the usual rule\n\nas  appellant entreats  would undermine  the core  principle on\n\nwhich  statutes of  limitations  in  employment  discrimination\n\ncases rest,  namely, protecting  employers \"from the  burden of\n\ndefending claims  arising from  employment decisions which  are\n\nlong  past,\" while,  concomitantly, protecting  those employees\n\nwho  act  celeritously  to enforce  their  perceptible  rights.\n\nRicks,  449 U.S. at 256-57 (citation omitted).  Charting such a\n     \n\ncourse  could  cause  perpetual   insecurity  on  the  part  of\n\nemployers,  for, unlike the giving of notice   a matter that is\n\n                               11\n\nsubject to  objective verification   the time  when an employee\n\nsuspects   an  employer's   discriminatory  animus   is  almost\n\nimpossible to verify, especially  since the employer most often\n\nwill deny that the animus  exists at all.  We see  no basis for\n\nimporting such uncertainty into the law.\n\n                               IV\n                                 \n\n                           Conclusion\n                                     \n\n          We need go no  further.5  \"Come what, come  may, time\n\nand  the  hour  runs  through   the  roughest  day.\"    William\n\nShakespeare,  Macbeth, act  I, sc. 3  (1606).

Sec. 1983 (1988).  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant is a financial analyst who has been employed by the Government Development Bank, an agency of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, since 1965.  On June 6, 1989, appellant received a letter from Emilio Pena-Fonseca, a senior vice president of the bank, telling him that he was under investigation for alleged illegalities related to the performance of his official duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Shortly thereafter, appellant appeared at an administrative hearing and denied the charges.  No other action was taken in this time frame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, the Commonwealth preferred criminal charges against appellant, alleging that he had committed the felony of undue influence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Following his arrest, appellant received a letter from Ramon Canter-Frau, president of the bank, suspending him from his post with pay \"until further notice.\"   This letter bore a date of October 9, and appellant does not deny that he received it on that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 26, appellant's prospects brightened;  a commonwealth court found no probable cause and dismissed the pending criminal charges.  Buoyed by this victory, appellant wrote a letter to the bank's board of directors inquiring about the status of his suspension.  The chairman of the board, Ramon Garcia Santiago (Garcia), acknowledged appellant's query by letter dated November 27.  Garcia informed appellant that the suspension constituted a temporary measure that would remain in effect pending the completion of an internal investigation being conducted by the bank.  Garcia's letter further noted that there had not yet been any \"final decision\" that could be appealed to the board of directors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 26, appellant received another letter from Canter-Frau.  This missive notified appellant that two internal charges had been lodged against him and offered him an opportunity to defend himself in respect to these charges at an administrative hearing.  The letter stated that a failure adequately to refute the charges could lead to appellant's discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just under a year later, appellant filed suit against the bank and various bank officials, including Garcia, Canter-Frau, and Pena-Fonseca.  Invoking 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, appellant claimed that the defendants had suspended him based on his race and political beliefs, thus violating his civil rights.  The defendants denied the accusations and, in due season, moved for summary judgment.  They contended, inter alia, that the suit, which had been commenced on December 21, 1990, was time-barred.  The motion was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended granting it.  The district court honored the recommendation.  Morris now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Applicable Legal Principles</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>The Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when the record reflects \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  \"In this context, 'genuine' means that the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party....\"  United States v. One Parcel of Real Property, Etc.  (Great Harbor Neck, New Shoreham, R.I.), 960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir.1992).  By like token, \" 'material' means that the fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\"  Id. (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of an order granting summary judgment is plenary.  See Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir.1993);  Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 352 (1st Cir.1992).  In undertaking such review, the court of appeals must scrutinize the summary judgment record in the light most amiable to the party opposing the motion, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.  See Pagano, 983 F.2d at 347;  Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the liberality of this standard, the nonmovant cannot simply rest on perfervid rhetoric and unsworn allegations.  When, for example, defendants invoke Rule 56 and identify a fatal flaw in a plaintiff's case, it becomes the plaintiff's burden to produce specific facts, in suitable evidentiary form, to contradict the flaw's existence and thereby establish the presence of a trialworthy issue.  See Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 352.   If the plaintiff fails to shoulder this burden, then the court may adjudicate the motion as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an appropriate case, Rule 56 can be employed to determine the applicability of a statutory time bar to a particular set of facts.  See id.;   see also Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 520 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>The Limitations Period</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Local law determines the limitations period for section 1983 claims.  See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 269, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1943, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985).  As a general rule, federal courts borrow the limitations period for personal injury actions and apply that period to section 1983 claims.  See id. at 276, 105 S.Ct. at 1947.   In Puerto Rico, the applicable limitations period is one year.  See P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 31, Sec. 5298(2) (1991);  see also Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353;  Rodriguez Narvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 42 (1st Cir.1990);  Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893 F.2d 404, 406 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases brought pursuant to section 1983, an inquiring court must consult federal law in order to fix the point in time from which the limitations period begins to accrue.  See Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353;  Street v. Vose, 936 F.2d 38, 40 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 948, 117 L.Ed.2d 117 (1992).  Under the federal rule, accrual commences when a plaintiff knows, or has reason to know, of the discriminatory act that underpins his cause of action.  See Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U.S. 6, 8, 102 S.Ct. 28, 29, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1981);  Delaware State Coll. v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 258, 101 S.Ct. 498, 504, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980);  Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue on appeal is whether the district court appropriately entered summary judgment on the ground that appellant sued beyond the one-year limitations period.  Since appellant commenced his action on December 21, 1990, our inquiry reduces to whether appellant's cause of action accrued more than one year before that date.  The defendants contend that the October 9 letter, which notified appellant of the suspension, sufficed to wind the limitations clock and start it ticking.  Appellant contends that he was not on sufficient notice of his predicament until he received the December 26 letter, and that the clock did not begin to tick until that moment.  The district court found that the defendants' clock kept better, more accurate time.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule in an employment discrimination case is that the limitations period begins to run when the claimant receives unambiguous and authoritative notice of the discriminatory act (which is another way of saying that the period begins to run when the employee learns of the adverse employment action).  See Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353 (holding that unequivocal notice of the adverse employment action is all that is required to trigger the limitations period) (collecting cases);  see also Sheldon H. Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation Sec. 9.05 at 265 (3d ed. 1991) (\"[I]t is only necessary for the plaintiff in an employment situation to be effectively notified of a discharge for the cause of action to accrue at the time of notification.\").  Thus, the key question to be answered here is temporal:  at what juncture did appellant reliably know of the injury to which this lawsuit relates?   See Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353.   In answering this question, the critical datum is the point in time at which the discriminatory act occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Ricks, 449 U.S. at 258, 101 S.Ct. at 504.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the October 9 letter speaks for itself--and its tones are stentorian.  That letter stated in plain terms that the bank had suspended appellant indefinitely.  It provided ample and unequivocal notice of the adverse employment action.  The terms and conditions of the suspension did not vary in any way from that moment forward.  Consequently, the limitations clock began to tick when appellant received the letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject appellant's asseveration that the letter of December 26, rather than the letter of October 9, marks the beginning of the limitations period.  The later letter did nothing more than provide notice to appellant of the continuance of his suspension.  Hence, this letter, which signifies a particularly painful point in the process because it advises appellant, presumably for the first time, of the possibility that he might be cashiered, had no effect upon the running of the limitations period.  After all, the point in time at which the consequences of the act become hardest to bear--which may or may not coincide with the occurrence of the act itself--has no relevance for purposes of framing the limitations period.  See Chardon, 454 U.S. at 8, 102 S.Ct. at 8;  Ricks 449 U.S. at 258, 101 S.Ct. at 504.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has another string to his bow--but it is badly frayed.  This initiative rests on the notion that appellant's claim did not accrue until he knew of both the suspension and the defendants' discriminatory animus.  Stated a different way, appellant contends that his cause of action existed in what amounts to a state of suspended animation until he became aware of the racial and political motives behind the adverse employment decision.  We cannot countenance this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is by now well established that, in employment discrimination actions, limitations periods normally start to run when the employer's decision is made and communicated to the affected employee.  See Ricks, 449 U.S. at 261, 101 S.Ct. at 505-06;  see also Muniz-Cabrero v. Ruiz, 23 F.3d 607, 610 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that, in such situations, the \"limitations period ... ordinarily starts when the plaintiff knows ... of the harm on which the action is based\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);  Nahmod supra, Sec. 9.04 at 252-53 (collecting cases).  This rule of law is grounded on a solid foundation:  when an employee knows that he has been hurt and also knows that his employer has inflicted the injury, it is fair to begin the countdown toward repose.  And the plaintiff need not know all the facts that support his claim in order for countdown to commence.  See Sturniolo v. Sheaffer, Eaton, Inc., 15 F.3d 1023, 1025 (11th Cir.1994);  Blumberg v. HCA Mgmt. Co., 848 F.2d 642, 645 (5th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1007, 109 S.Ct. 789, 102 L.Ed.2d 781 (1989);  see also Baker v. Board of Regents of State of Kan., 991 F.2d 628, 632 (10th Cir.1993);  Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 354;  cf. Jensen, 912 F.2d at 521-22 (enunciating substantially similar rule in respect to time constraints applicable to the filing of administrative notices in Title VII cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morris's case in no way warrants a departure from this settled rule of law.  By October 9, appellant had learned authoritatively of his suspension.  He knew the stated reason for it and could assess its legitimacy.  He knew how he had conducted himself while on official business.  As a veteran employee, he knew (or, alternatively, was chargeable with knowledge of) the agency's policies, practices, and precedents.  No more was exigible.  Appellant had sufficient information in October to enable him to bring a discrimination claim against the bank.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add two final comments.  First, we note that the rules for prescription of employment discrimination actions are not inflexible.  In a proper case, the doctrine of equitable tolling ensures fundamental fairness.  See, e.g., Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 633-36 (1st Cir.1988).  In this instance, however, appellant, though hinting at the possible applicability of equitable tolling, has neither explicitly claimed the doctrine's benefit nor demonstrated an entitlement to it.  Any such argument is, therefore, waived.  See Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.1990) (ruling \"that issues adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned\");  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (same), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the facts of this case do not lend any encouragement to the possibility of equitable modification.  To prevail on such a claim, an employee must prove not only that he was unaware of the employer's discriminatory animus but also that the employer actively misled him, to his detriment.  See Jensen, 912 F.2d at 521.   There is no evidence in the instant record to suggest either misleading conduct or detrimental reliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we think that deviating from the usual rule as appellant entreats would undermine the core principle on which statutes of limitations in employment discrimination cases rest, namely, protecting employers \"from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions which are long past,\" while, concomitantly, protecting those employees who act celeritously to enforce their perceptible rights.  Ricks, 449 U.S. at 256-57, 101 S.Ct. at 503 (citation omitted).  Charting such a course could cause perpetual insecurity on the part of employers, for, unlike the giving of notice--a matter that is subject to objective verification--the time when an employee suspects an employer's discriminatory animus is almost impossible to verify, especially since the employer most often will deny that the animus exists at all.  We see no basis for importing such uncertainty into the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  \"Come what, come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day.\"   William Shakespeare, Macbeth, act I, sc. 3 (1606).

Sec. 1983 (1988).  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant is a financial analyst who has been employed by the Government Development Bank, an agency of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, since 1965.  On June 6, 1989, appellant received a letter from Emilio Pena-Fonseca, a senior vice president of the bank, telling him that he was under investigation for alleged illegalities related to the performance of his official duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Shortly thereafter, appellant appeared at an administrative hearing and denied the charges.  No other action was taken in this time frame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, the Commonwealth preferred criminal charges against appellant, alleging that he had committed the felony of undue influence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Following his arrest, appellant received a letter from Ramon Canter-Frau, president of the bank, suspending him from his post with pay \"until further notice.\"   This letter bore a date of October 9, and appellant does not deny that he received it on that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 26, appellant's prospects brightened;  a commonwealth court found no probable cause and dismissed the pending criminal charges.  Buoyed by this victory, appellant wrote a letter to the bank's board of directors inquiring about the status of his suspension.  The chairman of the board, Ramon Garcia Santiago (Garcia), acknowledged appellant's query by letter dated November 27.  Garcia informed appellant that the suspension constituted a temporary measure that would remain in effect pending the completion of an internal investigation being conducted by the bank.  Garcia's letter further noted that there had not yet been any \"final decision\" that could be appealed to the board of directors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 26, appellant received another letter from Canter-Frau.  This missive notified appellant that two internal charges had been lodged against him and offered him an opportunity to defend himself in respect to these charges at an administrative hearing.  The letter stated that a failure adequately to refute the charges could lead to appellant's discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just under a year later, appellant filed suit against the bank and various bank officials, including Garcia, Canter-Frau, and Pena-Fonseca.  Invoking 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, appellant claimed that the defendants had suspended him based on his race and political beliefs, thus violating his civil rights.  The defendants denied the accusations and, in due season, moved for summary judgment.  They contended, inter alia, that the suit, which had been commenced on December 21, 1990, was time-barred.  The motion was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended granting it.  The district court honored the recommendation.

Since appellant commenced his action on December 21, 1990, our inquiry reduces to whether appellant's cause of action accrued more than one year before that date.  The defendants contend that the October 9 letter, which notified appellant of the suspension, sufficed to wind the limitations clock and start it ticking.  Appellant contends that he was not on sufficient notice of his predicament until he received the December 26 letter, and that the clock did not begin to tick until that moment.  The district court found that the defendants' clock kept better, more accurate time.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule in an employment discrimination case is that the limitations period begins to run when the claimant receives unambiguous and authoritative notice of the discriminatory act (which is another way of saying that the period begins to run when the employee learns of the adverse employment action).  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera-Muriente,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">353</span> </a></span>(holding that unequivocal notice of the adverse employment action is all that is required to trigger the limitations period) (collecting cases);  see also Sheldon H. Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation Sec. 9.05 at 265 (3d ed. 1991) (\"[I]t is only necessary for the plaintiff in an employment situation to be effectively notified of a discharge for the cause of action to accrue at the time of notification.\").  Thus, the key question to be answered here is temporal:  at what juncture did appellant reliably know of the injury to which this lawsuit relates?   See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Rivera-Muriente,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span>.   In answering this question, the critical datum is the point in time at which the discriminatory act occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110367\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ricks,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110367/delaware-state-college-v-ricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 101 S.Ct. at 504.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the October 9 letter speaks for itself--and its tones are stentorian.  That letter stated in plain terms that the bank had suspended appellant indefinitely.  It provided ample and unequivocal notice of the adverse employment action.  The terms and conditions of the suspension did not vary in any way from that moment forward.  Consequently, the limitations clock began to tick when appellant received the letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject appellant's asseveration that the letter of December 26, rather than the letter of October 9, marks the beginning of the limitations period.  The later letter did nothing more than provide notice to appellant of the continuance of his suspension.  Hence, this letter, which signifies a particularly painful point in the process because it advises appellant, presumably for the first time, of the possibility that he might be cashiered, had no effect upon the running of the limitations period.  After all, the point in time at which the consequences of the act become hardest to bear--which may or may not coincide with the occurrence of the act itself--has no relevance for purposes of framing the limitations period.

This initiative rests on the notion that appellant's claim did not accrue until he knew of both the suspension and the defendants' discriminatory animus.  Stated a different way, appellant contends that his cause of action existed in what amounts to a state of suspended animation until he became aware of the racial and political motives behind the adverse employment decision.

This rule of law is grounded on a solid foundation:  when an employee knows that he has been hurt and also knows that his employer has inflicted the injury, it is fair to begin the countdown toward repose.  And the plaintiff need not know all the facts that support his claim in order for countdown to commence.  See Sturniolo v.

By October 9, appellant had learned authoritatively of his suspension.  He knew the stated reason for it and could assess its legitimacy.  He knew how he had conducted himself while on official business.  As a veteran employee, he knew (or, alternatively, was chargeable with knowledge of) the agency's policies, practices, and precedents.  No more was exigible.  Appellant had sufficient information in October to enable him to bring a discrimination claim against the bank.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add two final comments.  First, we note that the rules for prescription of employment discrimination actions are not inflexible.  In a proper case, the doctrine of equitable tolling ensures fundamental fairness.  See, e.g., Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504001\"><a href=\"/opinion/504001/martin-rivera-gomez-v-rafael-adolfo-de-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span>, 633-36 (1st Cir.1988).  In this instance, however, appellant, though hinting at the possible applicability of equitable tolling, has neither explicitly claimed the doctrine's benefit nor demonstrated an entitlement to it.  Any such argument is, therefore, waived.  See Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550084\"><a href=\"/opinion/550084/maury-a-ryan-dba-ryan-klimek-ryan-partnership-v-royal-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 734 (1st Cir.1990) (ruling \"that issues adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned\");  United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.)

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span> </span>(1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the facts of this case do not lend any encouragement to the possibility of equitable modification.  To prevail on such a claim, an employee must prove not only that he was unaware of the employer's discriminatory animus but also that the employer actively misled him, to his detriment.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547202\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Jensen,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/547202/53-fair-emplpraccas-1450-54-empl-prac-dec-p-40191-donald-a-jensen/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span>.   There is no evidence in the instant record to suggest either misleading conduct or detrimental reliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we think that deviating from the usual rule as appellant entreats would undermine the core principle on which statutes of limitations in employment discrimination cases rest, namely, protecting employers \"from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions which are long past,\" while, concomitantly, protecting those employees who act celeritously to enforce their perceptible rights.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110367\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ricks,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/110367/delaware-state-college-v-ricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">256-57</span></a></span>, 101 S.Ct. at 503 (citation omitted).  Charting such a course could cause perpetual insecurity on the part of employers, for, unlike the giving of notice--a matter that is subject to objective verification--the time when an employee suspects an employer's discriminatory animus is almost impossible to verify, especially since the employer most often will deny that the animus exists at all.  We see no basis for importing such uncertainty into the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  \"Come what, come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day.\"   William Shakespeare, Macbeth, act I, sc. 3 (1606).  Here, appellant allowed too much time to run for too many days before instituting legal action.  Because the limitations period had expired, the lower court appropriately granted the defendants' motion for brevis disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> All dates mentioned in this opinion describe events occurring in 1989 unless otherwise indicated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The anti-corruption statute under which Morris was charged provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Every person who obtains or attempts to obtain from another any benefit by claiming or pretending that he is in a position to influence, in any way, the conduct of a public official or employee with respect to the exercise of his functions, shall be punished [as provided by law].</p>\n        <p>P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 33, Sec. 4364 (1983).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We believe it is vital to this inquiry that appellant is only contesting his suspension.  The bank never discharged him, and, in fact, appellant's counsel reported at oral argument that the bank eventually cleared him of all charges and reinstated him in his position.  Moreover, appellant received his salary and benefits throughout the period of his suspension</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Of course, it might be argued that a subtle change in circumstances occurred on November 27, when appellant, for the first time, learned that his suspension did not rise and fall with the outcome of the criminal charges.  But appellant has not cited November 27 as the trigger date, and, moreover, appellant's suit, measured from that date, would still be out of time.  For these reasons, it would serve no useful purpose to explore this possibility</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Because Morris's claims are time-barred, we take no view of any other possible deficiencies in his case, including the intriguing question of what (if any) damages he may have suffered</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
