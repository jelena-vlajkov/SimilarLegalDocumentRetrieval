Rev.\n\nStat. Ann.,  tit. 10   1176  (West 1994)).  On  cross-motions for\n\nsummary  judgment, the  district  court ruled  that  in order  to\n\ncomply  with  the  Maine statute,  Ford  must  revise the  window\n\nstickers on its cars sold in  Maine to reflect the surcharge Ford\n\nhad instituted to  recover its  costs of complying  with    1176.\n\nThe  district  court  refused,   however,  to  award  damages  or\n\nrestitution to the Dealers on their claims that Ford had violated\n\nthe  statute.   In  addition, the  district  court dismissed  the\n\nDealers' remaining  claims  under  the  Robinson-Patman  Act,  15\n\nU.S.C.   13(a) (1988),  and 10 M.R.S.A.    1174(1) and  1182 (Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann., tit. 10     1174(1), 1182 (West 1994)).  For the\n\nreasons set  forth below, we affirm  in part and reverse  in part\n\nthe decision of the district court.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\n\n          A.  The Manufacturer-Dealer Relationship\r                    A.  The Manufacturer-Dealer Relationship\r                                                            \n\n          Ford  manufactures automobiles and sells them through a\n\nnationwide  network   of  franchise   dealers.    The   franchise\n\nagreement,   called  the   Sales  and   Service  Agreement   (the\n\n\"Agreement\"), defines the manufacturer-dealer relationship.  Ford\n\noffers a warranty with all new cars.  Under the warranty, certain\n\nrepairs, replacements, or adjustments are made  free of charge to\n\nthe  consumer.  The  Dealers are required  under their Agreements\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nwith Ford to perform  labor and to provide parts  in satisfaction\n\nof the warranties.   Ford is obligated both under  the Agreements\n\nand under Maine statute  to reimburse the Dealers for  parts used\n\nand warranty work performed.\n\n          Historically,  and  until  1993,  Ford  reimbursed  the\n\nDealers for parts under a uniform national reimbursement formula.\n\nUnder  this  nationwide formula,  each dealer  is eligible  to be\n\nreimbursed  at wholesale  cost,  plus 30-40  percent above  cost,\n\ndepending on the vehicle model year.  \n\n          B.  State Legislation\r                    B.  State Legislation\r                                         \n\n          The  State of  Maine regulates  the manufacturer-dealer\n\nrelationship  by  statute,  see  10  M.R.S.A.     1171  et  seq.,\r                                                                          \n\nincluding  warranty  reimbursement levels.    Originally, Maine's\n\nwarranty  reimbursement  statute   required  car   manufacturers,\n\nincluding  Ford,   to  \"adequately  and  fairly   compensate  the\n\nfranchisee for any parts  provided in satisfaction of  a warranty\n\ncreated by the franchisor.\"  10 M.R.S.A.   1176 (1980).  In 1991,\n\nhowever,   1176 was amended to require manufacturers to reimburse\n\ndealers  at retail-equivalent  rates.   It currently  provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n            If a motor vehicle franchisor requires or\n            permits  a  motor  vehicle franchisee  to\n            perform   labor   or  provide   parts  in\n            satisfaction of a warranty created by the\n            franchisor, the franchisor shall properly\n            and   promptly   fulfill   its   warranty\n            obligations,   in   the  case   of  motor\n            vehicles over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle\n            weight   rating,  shall   adequately  and\n            fairly compensate the franchisee  for any\n            parts so provided and, in the case of all\n            other motor vehicles, shall reimburse the\r                                                               \n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            franchisee for any  parts so provided  at\r                                                               \n            the  retail  rate customarily  charged by\r                                                               \n            that  franchisee for the  same parts when\r                                                               \n            not   provided   in  satisfaction   of  a\r                                                               \n            warranty.\r                              \n\n 10  M.R.S.A.   1176 (1991) (Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann., tit. 10   1176\n\n(West 1994)) (emphasis added).\n\n          Notably,  the amended  statute requires  warranty parts\n\nreimbursement  \"at the  retail rate  customarily charged  for the\n\nsame parts when not provided in  satisfaction of a warranty.\"  10\r                    \n\nM.R.S.A.   1176 (emphasis  added).  The statute requires  a match\n\nbetween  the warranty  part and  the part  actually sold  by that\n\nparticular dealer  to a  non-warranty customer.   For  example, a\n\nparticular  dealer's  profit  margin  on  the  retail  sale of  a\n\nheadlight   cannot   be  used   to   determine  the   appropriate\n\nreimbursement  percentage  when  the dealer,  or  another dealer,\n\nreplaces a water pump under warranty. \n\n          C.  Events Leading to this Lawsuit\r                    C.  Events Leading to this Lawsuit\r                                                      \n\n          Following the  1991 amendment to    1176, several Maine\n\ndealers  notified Ford that the  new law entitled  them to higher\n\nwarranty reimbursement.   In 1992, one Maine  dealer filed claims\n\nin  small claims court for reimbursement.  The small claims court\n\ndismissed those  claims because the  dealer had not  submitted an\n\nadequate claim for reimbursement to Ford, which  it found to be a\n\nprerequisite   under  the  statute   to  reimbursement  recovery.\n\nDarling's Bangor Ford/VW/Audi v.  Ford Motor Co., No. BAN  92-sc-\r                                                          \n\n229 (Me. Dist. Ct. 3, S. Pen., Oct. 20, 1992).  \n\n          In response  to this dealer's  challenge, however, Ford\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nrevised its  reimbursement policy in Maine, and  announced to its\n\nMaine dealers on April  1, 1993 that the \"cost-plus\"  mark-up for\n\nparts reimbursement would be  raised for all Maine dealers  to 63\n\npercent.  This percentage corresponds to the percentage over cost\n\nused to  determine the  manufacturer's suggested retail  price of\n\nparts.1  With this  announcement, however, Ford also stated  that\n\nin order  to recover this increase in its costs of doing business\n\nin Maine, it would also increase  the wholesale price of each new\n\nvehicle sold, through assessment  of a surcharge of approximately\n\n$160  per vehicle.   The surcharge,  called the  \"warranty parity\n\nsurcharge,\" would  appear on each dealer's  monthly parts invoice\n\nin the month following the sale.  The surcharge was imposed based\n\non the number of  cars sold, without regard to whether the dealer\n\nactually performed warranty work in that month.2 \n\n          The  Dealers filed  this lawsuit  in the  United States\n\nDistrict  Court  for the  District  of Maine,  alleging  that the\n\nsurcharge  was unlawful,  requesting  that the  court enjoin  the\n\nsurcharge  and  order Ford  to  \"disgorge\"  the surcharge  monies\n\nalready  recovered.   The  Dealers argued  that    1176  not only\n                    \r                              \n\n1   Ford states that a dealer could obtain a higher reimbursement\nmark-up  on a particular part merely  by submitting the necessary\ndocumentation to  Ford,  in accordance  with    1176  and  Ford's\nestablished reimbursement procedures.\n\n2   The Dealers submitted the affidavits of two dealers attesting\nthat they paid more in surcharges than they received in increased\nreimbursement under  the new policy.   Ford points  out, however,\nthat while some dealers pay  more in a given month under  the new\npolicy,  others pay less and  receive more.   The surcharge, Ford\nstated during oral argument before this court, was  calculated to\nrecoup  Ford's  increased  costs  of doing  business  over  time,\r                                                                          \nspreading those costs evenly among the dealers. \n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nrequired   higher   warranty  reimbursement   levels,   but  also\n\nprohibited  Ford from  raising  wholesale prices  to recover  the\n\ncosts  of paying those higher reimbursement  levels.  They argued\n\nthat  the surcharge effectively  negated the higher reimbursement\n\nlevels required  by   1176,  in contravention of  the legislative\n\npurpose  of the amended statute.   The Dealers  also alleged that\n\nFord's surcharge violated the Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act\n\nand  the Robinson-Patman Act,  and made claims  under other Maine\n\nstatutes.\n\n          Ford moved to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) or\n\nalternatively  for summary judgment under  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56 on\n\nthe  grounds that, as a matter of law, the warranty reimbursement\n\nlevel and the  surcharge were  lawful.3  The  Dealers also  moved\n\nfor partial summary judgment,  seeking a final injunction against\n\nthe  price increase,  and  requesting damages  and other  relief.\n\nThey argued that any price increase  to recover the reimbursement\n\nrate required  by   1176  was itself a violation  of the statute.\n\nThey contended  that the Maine  legislature, in amending    1176,\n\nhad intended that  the cost of Ford's warranty be  borne by Ford,\n\nand not by the Dealers, and that the surcharge improperly shifted\n\nthe  financial  burden back  to the  Dealers.   According  to the\n\nDealers,     1176 was  about  \"dealers'  rights,\"  and  thus  any\r                                                                           \n\n                    \r                              \n\n3  Ford also raised challenges to the  statute on various federal\nstatutory  and  constitutional  grounds.     The  district  court\nrejected these challenges, and  Ford has not raised them  in this\nappeal.\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nwholesale price increase was unlawful.4\n\n                    \r                              \n\n4   The Dealers also  argued that,  in the alternative,  the only\nlawful  way for  Ford  to  recoup  its  increased  costs  was  to\ninstitute a  wholesale price  increase nationwide.   The district\ncourt rejected this suggestion,  and the Dealers do not  raise it\non appeal.\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          D.

The February Order\n\n          The  district court  ruled on  the parties'  motions on\n\nFebruary  15, 1994,  treating both  motions as  ones  for summary\n\njudgment.  The parties  offer vastly different interpretations of\n\nthe February  Order.  We acknowledge that the court's conclusions\n\nare  not crystal-clear.    We do  not  think, however,  that  the\n\ncourt's  decision is fairly subject to such disparate readings as\n\ngiven by the parties.  \n\n          First, the district  court denied the Dealers'  request\n\nfor damages  based on Ford's  alleged past failures  to reimburse\n\nthe  Dealers according to  the amended    1176.  The  court ruled\n\nthat the Dealers  did not make an adequately particularized claim\n\nto Ford prior to bringing suit.  \n\n          The  court then  addressed the  Dealers' objections  to\n\nFord's   reimbursement  policy  and  warranty  parity  surcharge.\n\nRegarding   the   Dealers'   arguments   that  the   63   percent\n\nreimbursement rate  was not  sufficient under    1176,  the court\n\nstated:\n\n            The plain  language  of    1176  requires\n            that Ford reimburse  its dealers \"at  the\n            retail rate customarily  charged by  that\r                                                               \n            franchisee  for the  same parts  when not\r                                                     \n            provided in satisfaction of  a warranty.\"\n            10 M.R.S.A.   1176 (Supp. 1993) (emphasis\n            added).  Literally this requires  Ford to\n            pay  a  dealer the  same  rate that  that\n            particular dealer would have  charged for\n            that  particular part  if the  dealer had\n            provided  it  to a  nonwarranty customer.\n            Ford's policy of  reimbursing dealers  at\n            the suggested  list price may  or may not\n            satisfy   1176  depending on whether  the\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n            individual  dealer  customarily   charges\n            more or  less than Ford's  suggested list\n            price.  . .  .  As  discussed above,  the\r                                                               \n            Dealers have not submitted a sufficiently\r                                                               \n            particularized claim to  Ford in order to\r                                                               \n            recover    for   Ford's    past   alleged\r                                                               \n            underpayments.    Moreover,  the  Dealers\r                                   \n            have  failed  to  submit  enough  factual\r                                                               \n            material   from   which  the   Court  can\r                                                               \n            determine  whether   Ford's  practice  of\r                               \n            reimbursing dealers at  63% above  dealer\n            cost violates   1176.\n\nOn these  grounds,  the  court  denied the  Dealers'  motion  for\n\npartial  summary  judgment, declining  to  find  Ford liable  for\n\ndamages,  declare Ford's  current reimbursement rate  illegal, or\n\nissue an  injunction requiring that Ford reimburse the Dealers at\n\na higher rate.\n\n          The court  then addressed  the Dealers'  arguments that\n\nthe warranty parity surcharge  violates   1176.  The  court first\n\nrejected the Dealers' claim that Ford has no right to recover its\n\nincreased  costs of compliance with the Maine statute.  The court\n\nwent on, however, to state that Ford may not recover its cost \"in\n\nsuch a  way as  to thwart the  purpose of  the legislation,\"  and\n\nfound that the $160  warranty surcharge did just that.  The court\n\nstated that  the surcharge  contravened the  \"legislative intent\"\n\nbehind   1176 and was thus \"inappropriate.\" \n\n          In  reaching  this  conclusion,  the  court  relied  by\n\nanalogy upon the New York \"Lemon Law\" cases.5  The court stated:\n\n            Similarly, if Ford  had simply  increased\n            the  wholesale price  of its  vehicle and\r                                                               \n            reflected  this  increased  price in  its\n                    \r                              \n\n5  See discussion infra regarding the district court's use of the\r                                 \nNew York Lemon Law cases.\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n            suggested  retail  price for  automobiles\n            sold  in Maine,  the  Court would  likely\r                                                               \n            have  reached   a  different  conclusion.\r                                                              \n            Ford,  however,  increased  its  warranty\n            parts  reimbursement  to dealers  only to\n            recoup these costs directly  from dealers\n            on  the same  parts  statement.

The court therefore ruled\n\nthat Ford may pass  on the increased costs of compliance, but may\n\ndo so only if it also instituted a corresponding increase in each\n\ncar's  \"sticker\" price.6  This sticker price issue had never been\n\nbriefed  by  the parties,  although it  was discussed  during the\n\nsummary judgment hearing. \n\n            2.

The\n\nDealers  requested that  the district  court issue  a declaratory\n\njudgment  declaring  the  warranty parity  surcharge  illegal and\n\norder  Ford to refund the warranty surcharges already paid.  Ford\n\nrequested  that the  court  modify its  order  to allow  Ford  to\n                    \r                              \n\n6   15 U.S.C.    1232  requires that  auto manufacturers  affix a\nlabel, the so-called \"Monroney  sticker,\" on each new automobile,\ndisclosing information  such as  the suggested retail  price, the\nprice   for   each   accessory   or   optional   equipment,   and\ntransportation charges.\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nimplement its price increase by including an additional amount on\n\nthe  dealer  invoice,  rather  than by  increasing  the  Monroney\n\nsticker price.7  In an order issued March  30, 1994, the district\n\ncourt denied  Ford's request,  stating that Ford  was effectively\n\nseeking a \"prospective advisory opinion\" on an issue not ripe for\n\ndisposition.   The court then  denied the Dealers'  request for a\n\nrefund  of  the  already-paid  surcharges,  explaining  that  its\n\nFebruary  Order was only to apply prospectively.  The March Order\n\ndid little  to clarify  the court's  original ruling,  but merely\n\nreiterated  that  \"Ford's warranty  parity  surcharge,  as it  is\n\ncurrently structured, is illegal.\"   The court also dismissed the\n\nremaining  counts  of  the  Dealers'  Complaint.

Because of their\n\ndifferent versions, their framing of the  issues relevant to this\n\nappeal differs  broadly.   The Dealers insist  that the  \"central\n\nissue\" in this action is whether Ford's $160 surcharge violates  \n\n1176, as they  repeatedly contend the  district court found,  and\n\n\"what relief should  flow to the  Dealers.\"   Ford, on the  other\n\nhand,  argues  that  the  district  court  ruled  that  Ford  may\r                                                                           \n\ninstitute  a  wholesale price  increase,  but  only  if  it  also\r                                                             \n\nincreases the Monroney sticker price.  Ford's primary argument on\n\nappeal, accordingly, is that  this sticker price increase is  not\n\nrequired by   1176, and indeed,  brings   1176 into conflict with\n\nfederal law. \n\n          Fortunately,  our  analysis  of  the  issues raised  on\n\nappeal does not require that we accept one party's \"version\" over\n\nthe  other.8    Because we are  able here to  analyze each of the\n                    \r                              \n\n8   We do not believe,  however, that the Dealers  are correct in\ntheir  contention that  the  district court  found the  surcharge\n\"illegal\" in and of itself.  In offering this interpretation, the\nDealers  take the court's  use of the  word \"illegal\" out  of the\nsentence and  out of  its context.   The district  court did  not\nstate  that the surcharge was per se  illegal, but rather that it\r                                              \nwas  illegal  \"as  it  is currently  structured\"  and  allowed  a\nwholesale  price  increase  only  on  the condition  that  it  be\r                                          \naccompanied  by a  sticker  price increase.    Indeed, the  court\nstated  that if Ford had instituted an accompanying sticker price\nincrease, the court may have ruled differently.\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nparties'  arguments  without  addressing  the  dispute  over  the\n\ndistrict court's  ruling, the ambiguities in  the court's opinion\n\nare rendered irrelevant.\n\n          C.

Ford contends  that there\n\nis absolutely  nothing in the language of    1176 to even suggest\n\nthis  requirement, and  that it likewise  cannot be  justified by\n\nsome vague reference to \"legislative intent.\"\n\n          Because  this issue  involves  the interpretation  of a\n\nMaine state statute,  we are  bound to apply  the principles  set\n\nforth  by  Maine's  Supreme  Judicial  Court.

First,\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nwe must address whether, as an initial matter, the district court\n\ncorrectly rejected the Dealers' arguments  that Ford had no right\n\nto pass on its  increased costs of doing business  resulting from\n\ncompliance  with    1176.   Then we  examine whether  the court's\n\norder  requiring Ford to  institute a sticker  price increase was\n\nsupported by the statute.\n\n          Nothing  in   the  language  of      1176  prohibits  a\n\nmanufacturer from  increasing vehicle prices in  order to recover\n\nits increased compliance  costs.  The statute  says nothing about\n\nwholesale   or   retail  prices,   and   apparently   leaves  the\n\nmanufacturer free to increase wholesale prices, and the dealer to\n\nincrease  retail prices.  The legislative  history of the amended\n\nstatute  also  does  not  indicate  that  the  Maine  legislature\n\nintended to  set  price controls  or  to force  manufacturers  to\n\nwholly  bear the costs of  compliance.  Moreover,  as Ford points\n\nout,  it  is  quite   commonplace  for  manufacturers  and  other\n\nregulated  entities to pass  on to retailers  and consumers their\n\ncosts of complying  with regulatory  statutes.  This  is so  even\n\nwhen  the costs  are  passed on  to  the \"beneficiaries\"  of  the\n\nregulations.   See, e.g., Motor  &amp; Equip. Mfrs.  Ass'n v.

Therefore, we hold that the district court properly\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nruled that   1176  does not prohibit Ford or  other manufacturers\n\nfrom recovering their costs of compliance.\n\n          Just as the  statute contains  no language  restricting\n\ncost  recovery, it  also contains  no language  conditioning cost\r                                                                      \n\nrecovery.   The statute deals solely  with warranty reimbursement\n\ntransactions between  manufacturer and dealer, and  no mention is\n\nmade of any other contingencies.  The Dealers have not pointed to\n\none word  contained in   1176, nor can we find one, that suggests\n\nthat  the statute  contemplates anything  other than  the limited\n\nsubject of warranty reimbursement.   \n\n          The  legislative  history  to    1176  also  lacks  any\n\nindication  that the  Maine legislature  intended to  condition a\n\nmanufacturer's recovery  of its  compliance costs.   As we  noted\n\nabove,  Maine law  initially  required  only  that  manufacturers\n\n\"adequately  and  fairly compensate  each  of  its motor  vehicle\n\ndealers for labor and parts.\"  When the Maine legislature amended\n\n  1176  in 1980 to provide that reimbursement for labor be at the\r                                                                 \n\ncustomary retail rate, the legislature explained in its Statement\n\nof Fact:\n\n            With their  superior bargaining position,\n            automakers  have  in   the  past   forced\n            dealers to accept reimbursement at a rate\n            substantially  lower  than  the  dealers'\n            usual retail  rate.   The net  effect has\n            been  that,  through  an  inflated  labor\r                                                               \n            rate,    non-warranty   customers    have\r                                                       \n            subsidized automakers  who were unwilling\n            to  pay  the  fair  and  full  price  for\n            repairs   made   necessary   when   their\n            automobiles   failed  to   meet  warranty\n            standards.

In  1991, when the legislature amended    1176\n\nto require that dealers be compensated for parts at the customary\r                                                          \n\nretail rate, it stated only that the purpose of the amendment was\n\nto make  compensation  for parts  the  same as  compensation  for\n\nlabor.   Me. L.D. 1235,  115th Leg., 1st  Sess. (March  21, 1991)\n\n(Statement of Fact).  \n\n          Quite simply, this sparse  legislative history fails to\n\nsuggest any statutory purpose or legislative intent to prevent or\n\ncondition manufacturers'  cost recovery.9  It  certainly does not\n\nindicate,  either   expressly   or  implicitly,   that   warranty\n\nreimbursement  costs  cannot be  passed  on  by manufacturers  to\n\ndealers,  and  then from  dealers to  consumers.   It  simply and\n\nsolely regulates the rates  at which manufacturers must reimburse\n\ndealers  for warranty labor and parts.  We therefore cannot find,\n\nnor  can  we reasonably  or  fairly infer,  that  the legislature\n\nintended to prohibit or condition manufacturer cost recovery.  In\n\nlight of this complete dearth of statutory or historical evidence\n\nsupporting  the  district  court's  order that  Ford  revise  its\n\nMonroney stickers, we  must find that the  district court's order\n                    \r                              \n\n9    In fact,  if anything,  the  legislative history  belies the\nDealers'  contention that  the statute  was amended  to \"protect\"\ndealers.  We think  that an objective reading of  the legislative\nhistory  indicates   the   legislature  decided   that   warranty\nreimbursement  levels would  be  at  retail  rates, in  order  to\nprevent  non-warranty  customers from  being charged  prices much\nhigher than the customary retail  rates.  Therefore, if anything,\nthe statute was arguably  meant to protect non-warranty consumers\r                                                                           \nfrom inflated  prices charged by  dealers who  are attempting  to\nmaintain  their  average   profit  margins  in  the  face   of  a\nmanufacturer's below-retail reimbursement rates. \n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nis  completely  unsupported  by  the  state  law,  and  therefore\n\nerroneous.  \n\n          In making its determination, the  district court relied\n\nby  analogy on the New York \"Lemon  Law\" cases.  This reliance is\n\nmisplaced.  In State of  New York v. Ford Motor Co., the New York\r                                                             \n\nCourt of  Appeals held that Ford's written warranty, which stated\n\nthat the retail purchaser of  a vehicle would be required  to pay\n\nthe  first $100 of any  warranty repair charge,  violated the New\n\nYork  state \"Lemon Law,\" N.Y.  Gen. Bus. Law    198-a (McKinney's\n\n1983).  State of New York v. Ford Motor Co., 548 N.E.2d 906, 908-\r                                                     \n\n909 (N.Y. 1989).  The court's ruling rested entirely on the plain\n\nlanguage of the  statute, which  provided that when  a new  motor\n\nvehicle does  not  conform  to all  express  warranties  for  the\n\nearlier of its first two years or 18,000 miles, \"the manufacturer\n\n. . . shall correct said nonconformity . . . at no charge  to the\r                                                                           \n\nconsumer.\" (emphasis added).   As the court recognized,  \"[i]t is\r                  \n\ndifficult  to imagine  the  disputed $100  deductible being  more\n\neasily resolved\" than  by the plain, unequivocal  language of the\n\nstatute.

Ford,  at its  own\r                                                                           \n\ninitiative,  placed  this  surcharge  on  its  Monroney  sticker,\r                    \n\ndescribing it as \"N.Y.

When  the New  York\r                              \n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nlegislature passed  a law prohibiting manufacturers  from placing\n\nthis item on the Monroney sticker, the district court struck down\n\nthe  law as  an unconstitutional  restraint on  lawful commercial\n\nspeech.  Id. at 808.   In so doing,  the court noted that \"it  is\r                     \n\nentirely lawful for an automobile  manufacturer to impose on  its\n\ncustomers a  charge resulting from  the costs of  compliance with\n\nthe Lemon Law.\"  Id. at 806. \r                             \n\n          The  Lemon  Law  cases  offer little  support  for  the\n\ndistrict  court's order here.   First, the plain  language of the\n\nLemon Law specifically prohibited  the deductible at issue before\n\nthe state court, whereas the Maine statute involved here does not\n\neither  expressly  or  implicitly  require  the  district court's\n\nresult.   More importantly, although  the New York district court\n\nrecognized that Ford could recover  its costs of compliance  with\n\nthe  Lemon Law, the court did not require a corresponding sticker\n\nprice increase; rather, Ford instituted such  an increase in that\n\nsituation voluntarily, as a result of its own business decisions.\n\nIts sticker price increase  was not mandated or suggested  by the\n\nLemon Law itself, nor by the state court's opinions.  In the case\n\nat bar,  the district court's reliance on  the Lemon Law cases to\n\nsupport  its own  ruling  that Ford  must  increase its  Monroney\r                                                   \n\nsticker price is entirely unfounded.\n\n          Finally, the district court's  order cannot be salvaged\n\nby  its references  to  some  unspecified  and  vague  notion  of\n\n\"legislative  intent.\"    It is  not  appropriate  for a  federal\n\ndistrict  court, however  well-intentioned, to  set forth  a rule\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nunsupported  by a state statute.

Because  nothing in   1176 or its\n\nhistory conditions cost recovery  by a manufacturer, the district\n\ncourt was not authorized to impose such a condition  on the basis\n\nof  some  inferred  legislative  policy.    The  court  therefore\n\noverstepped  the bounds  of its  authority and  entered territory\n\nproperly  left to the Maine  legislature when it  ordered Ford to\n\nrevise   its  Monroney   stickers  on   cars  sold   in  Maine.10\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the portion of the district court's order\n\nrequiring Ford to institute a Monroney sticker price increase.\n\n          D.

The\n\nDealers  explain that in requesting the return of the surcharges,\n\nthey  were  seeking  the  equitable remedy  of  restitution,  the\n\ndisgorgement of  funds obtained under an unlawful  policy.11  The\n                    \r                              \n\n10  Because we find the district court's order erroneous, we need\nnot  address Ford's arguments that  the order brings    1176 into\nconflict with federal law.\n\n11   The Dealers rely on  Porter v. Warner Holding  Co., 328 U.S.\r                                                                 \n395, 402  (1946) and  Tull v.

However, as revealed by\nour analysis, these cases do not control here.  The central issue\nin Porter v. Warner  Holding Co. was whether the  Emergency Price\r                                          \nControl Act of 1942, establishing national rent controls, limited\nthe power  of federal courts  to order  restitution of  excessive\nrents collected  in violation of  the Act.

The improper profits at issue in the Porter case were rents\r                                                           \n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\ndistrict court denied the  Dealers' request for \"disgorgement\" on\n\nthe grounds that the Dealers may have actually passed on the cost\n\nof the  surcharge to their customers,  and therefore, presumably,\n\nthe Dealers sustained no actual injury.  \n\n          In support of their  contention, the Dealers explain in\n\ntheir  brief that  the Maine  legislature \"intended  and required\n\nthat  Ford  pay  more\"  than  it   had  previously  been  paying.\r                               \n\n(Emphasis in original).   The  Dealers argue that  in amending   \n\n1176,  the legislature  \"intended  that the  financial burden  of\n\nsupplying  Ford's warranty be borne by Ford, not by the Dealers,\"\n\nand  that    1176  is a  \"cost-shifting\"  statute.   Because  the\n\nwarranty parity surcharge recovered the very funds that  Ford was\n\npaying  under the amended   1176,  Ford was \"illegally\" paying to\n\nthe Dealers less than was statutorily required.  \n\n          This  argument rests  on the  unfounded premise  that  \n\n1176 prevents Ford from  recovering its compliance costs.   It is\n\nclear that  in amending    1176, the  Maine legislature  intended\n                    \r                              \n\ncollected  in   direct  violation   of  a   statute  specifically\nestablishing price controls.   As we discussed above,   1176 does\nnot  establish price  controls,  nor  mandate that  manufacturers\nsolely bear the  burden of compliance.   To the contrary,    1176\nmerely  sets  forth  warranty  reimbursement levels,  and  leaves\nunregulated the  methods by which  affected parties  may bear  or\npass on the costs of compliance.   \n\n   The  Tull case is also inapposite.  The \"quotation\" offered by\r                      \nthe Dealers in their brief was pulled out of the most  tangential\ndictum  from  that  case,  during  which  the  Court  was  merely\ndiscussing (and rejecting) the government's analogy between civil\npenalties  under the  Clean Water  Act and  equitable actions  of\ndisgorgement.    Moreover, not  only  is  the Dealers'  proffered\n\"quotation\" from that case taken out of context,  but manipulated\nso as to acquire a meaning nothing  like the original.  We do not\nappreciate such fast-and-loose use of case law.\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nthat the manufacturers \"pay more\" in warranty reimbursements.  It\n\nis  not at all clear, however, that the legislature intended that\n\nmanufacturers simply absorb those costs, and could not  pass them\n\non  by means of a wholesale cost increase, a dealer surcharge, or\n\na retail  cost increase.   There is  no support for  the Dealers'\n\ncontention  that   1176 is  a \"cost-shifting\" statute,  and as we\n\nexplained, we will not infer such  legislative intent without any\n\nevidence  whatsoever.  The Dealers' position that   1176 prevents\n\nFord  from  recovering its  costs  is  therefore incorrect.    It\n\nfollows  that  their contention  that  the  surcharges --  Ford's\n\nchosen mechanism for cost  recovery -- were unlawfully collected,\n\nis also  incorrect.  Because  the surcharges  were not  unlawful,\n\nthen, Ford was not unjustly enriched.\n\n          In  any case,  after  carefully  reviewing  the  entire\n\nrecord,  we agree with the  district court that  the Dealers have\n\nnot  shown that they actually absorbed the cost of the surcharges\n\nand did not pass them on to their customers in the form of higher\n\nprices.  If the Dealers have passed on their costs, then awarding\n\nrestitution of  the surcharges would result in  a windfall double\n\nrecovery by the Dealers.\n\n          In sum, neither the language or purpose of the statute,\n\nnor  the  facts   on  record,  support  the  Dealers'  claim  for\n\nrestitution  of  surcharges  already   collected  by  Ford.    We\n\ntherefore affirm the district court's rejection of this claim.  \n\n          E.   The Dealers' Other Claims\r                    E.

By\n\nimposing additional costs in Maine but not in those other states,\n\nthe Dealers contended that Ford violated the Robinson-Patman Act,\n\n15 U.S.C.    13(a).

Any differences\n\nin  vehicle   prices   resulting   from   the   higher   warranty\n\nreimbursement levels  would fall squarely within  the safe harbor\n\nallowed by the Act, and therefore be lawful.

Claims under 10 M.R.S.A.   1174(1)\n\n          The Dealers contend that the district court erroneously\n\ndismissed their claims that Ford had engaged in unfair methods of\n\ncompetition and  unfair and deceptive practices,  in violation of\n\n10 M.R.S.A.    1174(1).  They  argue that those claims  should be\n\ntried on their merits.\n\n          The Dealers'   1174(1) claims, however, rest upon their\n\nallegations that  Ford's warranty surcharge  was illegal.   As we\n\nheld above, the surcharge did not violate   1176.  Thus, in light\n\nof the fact that  Ford committed no unlawful acts  in instituting\n\nits warranty surcharge, the Dealers'   1174(1) claims necessarily\n\ncollapse.    We therefore  hold that  these claims  were properly\n\ndismissed, and we affirm the dismissal.\n\n            3.  Claims under 10 M.R.S.A.   1182\r                      3.  Claims under 10 M.R.S.A.   1182\n\n          Finally,  the Dealers  assert  that the  district court\n\nerred in  dismissing their claims that  Ford's warranty surcharge\n\nviolated  public policy within the meaning of 10 M.R.S.A.   1182.\n\nSection  1182   authorizes  courts   to  grant   declaratory  and\n\ninjunctive  relief for  practices in  violation of  certain Maine\n\nstatutes, including    1176.  Because,  as we have  explained, we\n\nfind that Ford did not violate   1176,  the Dealers' claims under\n\n  1182 are moot.\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court's opinion\n\nis affirmed in part and  reversed in part.  Remanded for  actions\r                                                              \n\nconsistent with this opinion.  No costs to either party.\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n",

Sec. 1176 (Me.Rev.Stat.Ann., tit. 10 Sec. 1176 (West 1994)).  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that in order to comply with the Maine statute, Ford must revise the window stickers on its cars sold in Maine to reflect the surcharge Ford had instituted to recover its costs of complying with Sec. 1176.  The district court refused, however, to award damages or restitution to the Dealers on their claims that Ford had violated the statute.  In addition, the district court dismissed the Dealers' remaining claims under the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 13(a) (1988), and 10 M.R.S.A. Secs. 1174(1) and 1182 (Me.Rev.Stat.Ann., tit. 10 Secs. 1174(1), 1182 (West 1994)).  For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Manufacturer-Dealer Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ford manufactures automobiles and sells them through a nationwide network of franchise dealers.  The franchise agreement, called the Sales and Service Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), defines the manufacturer-dealer relationship.  Ford offers a warranty with all new cars.  Under the warranty, certain repairs, replacements, or adjustments are made free of charge to the consumer.  The Dealers are required under their Agreements with Ford to perform labor and to provide parts in satisfaction of the warranties.  Ford is obligated both under the Agreements and under Maine statute to reimburse the Dealers for parts used and warranty work performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, and until 1993, Ford reimbursed the Dealers for parts under a uniform national reimbursement formula.  Under this nationwide formula, each dealer is eligible to be reimbursed at wholesale cost, plus 30-40 percent above cost, depending on the vehicle model year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. State Legislation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State of Maine regulates the manufacturer-dealer relationship by statute, see 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1171 et seq., including warranty reimbursement levels.  Originally, Maine's warranty reimbursement statute required car manufacturers, including Ford, to \"adequately and fairly compensate the franchisee for any parts provided in satisfaction of a warranty created by the franchisor.\"   10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1176 (1980).  In 1991, however, Sec. 1176 was amended to require manufacturers to reimburse dealers at retail-equivalent rates.  It currently provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>If a motor vehicle franchisor requires or permits a motor vehicle franchisee to perform labor or provide parts in satisfaction of a warranty created by the franchisor, the franchisor shall properly and promptly fulfill its warranty obligations, in the case of motor vehicles over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating, shall adequately and fairly compensate the franchisee for any parts so provided and, in the case of all other motor vehicles, shall reimburse the franchisee for any parts so provided at the retail rate customarily charged by that franchisee for the same parts when not provided in satisfaction of a warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1176 (1991) (Me.Rev.Stat.Ann., tit. 10 Sec. 1176 (West 1994)) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, the amended statute requires warranty parts reimbursement \"at the retail rate customarily charged for the same parts when not provided in satisfaction of a warranty.\"   10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1176 (emphasis added).  The statute requires a match between the warranty part and the part actually sold by that particular dealer to a non-warranty customer.  For example, a particular dealer's profit margin on the retail sale of a headlight cannot be used to determine the appropriate reimbursement percentage when the dealer, or another dealer, replaces a water pump under warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Events Leading to this Lawsuit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the 1991 amendment to Sec. 1176, several Maine dealers notified Ford that the new law entitled them to higher warranty reimbursement.  In 1992, one Maine dealer filed claims in small claims court for reimbursement.  The small claims court dismissed those claims because the dealer had not submitted an adequate claim for reimbursement to Ford, which it found to be a prerequisite under the statute to reimbursement recovery.  Darling's Bangor Ford/VW/Audi v. Ford Motor Co., No. BAN 92-sc-229 (Me.Dist.Ct. 3, S.Pen., Oct. 20, 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to this dealer's challenge, however, Ford revised its reimbursement policy in Maine, and announced to its Maine dealers on April 1, 1993 that the \"cost-plus\" mark-up for parts reimbursement would be raised for all Maine dealers to 63 percent.  This percentage corresponds to the percentage over cost used to determine the manufacturer's suggested retail price of parts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  With this announcement, however, Ford also stated that in order to recover this increase in its costs of doing business in Maine, it would also increase the wholesale price of each new vehicle sold, through assessment of a surcharge of approximately $160 per vehicle.  The surcharge, called the \"warranty parity surcharge,\" would appear on each dealer's monthly parts invoice in the month following the sale.  The surcharge was imposed based on the number of cars sold, without regard to whether the dealer actually performed warranty work in that month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dealers filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maine, alleging that the surcharge was unlawful, requesting that the court enjoin the surcharge and order Ford to \"disgorge\" the surcharge monies already recovered.  The Dealers argued that Sec. 1176 not only required higher warranty reimbursement levels, but also prohibited Ford from raising wholesale prices to recover the costs of paying those higher reimbursement levels.  They argued that the surcharge effectively negated the higher reimbursement levels required by Sec. 1176, in contravention of the legislative purpose of the amended statute.  The Dealers also alleged that Ford's surcharge violated the Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act and the Robinson-Patman Act, and made claims under other Maine statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ford moved to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) or alternatively for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 on the grounds that, as a matter of law, the warranty reimbursement level and the surcharge were lawful.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The Dealers also moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a final injunction against the price increase, and requesting damages and other relief.  They argued that any price increase to recover the reimbursement rate required by Sec. 1176 was itself a violation of the statute.  They contended that the Maine legislature, in amending Sec. 1176, had intended that the cost of Ford's warranty be borne by Ford, and not by the Dealers, and that the surcharge improperly shifted the financial burden back to the Dealers.  According to the Dealers, Sec. 1176 was about \"dealers' rights,\" and thus any wholesale price increase was unlawful.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The District Court's Orders</p>\n    <p>1. The February Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled on the parties' motions on February 15, 1994, treating both motions as ones for summary judgment, 844 F.Supp. 819.   The parties offer vastly different interpretations of the February Order.  We acknowledge that the court's conclusions are not crystal-clear.  We do not think, however, that the court's decision is fairly subject to such disparate readings as given by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court denied the Dealers' request for damages based on Ford's alleged past failures to reimburse the Dealers according to the amended Sec. 1176.  The court ruled that the Dealers did not make an adequately particularized claim to Ford prior to bringing suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then addressed the Dealers' objections to Ford's reimbursement policy and warranty parity surcharge.  Regarding the Dealers' arguments that the 63 percent reimbursement rate was not sufficient under Sec. 1176, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The plain language of Sec. 1176 requires that Ford reimburse its dealers \"at the retail rate customarily charged by that franchisee for the same parts when not provided in satisfaction of a warranty.\"   10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1176 (Supp.1993) (emphasis added).  Literally this requires Ford to pay a dealer the same rate that that particular dealer would have charged for that particular part if the dealer had provided it to a nonwarranty customer.  Ford's policy of reimbursing dealers at the suggested list price may or may not satisfy Sec. 1176 depending on whether the individual dealer customarily charges more or less than Ford's suggested list price....  As discussed above, the Dealers have not submitted a sufficiently particularized claim to Ford in order to recover for Ford's past alleged underpayments.   Moreover, the Dealers have failed to submit enough factual material from which the Court can determine whether Ford's practice of reimbursing dealers at 63% above dealer cost violates Sec. 1176.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these grounds, the court denied the Dealers' motion for partial summary judgment, declining to find Ford liable for damages, declare Ford's current reimbursement rate illegal, or issue an injunction requiring that Ford reimburse the Dealers at a higher rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then addressed the Dealers' arguments that the warranty parity surcharge violates Sec. 1176.  The court first rejected the Dealers' claim that Ford has no right to recover its increased costs of compliance with the Maine statute.  The court went on, however, to state that Ford may not recover its cost \"in such a way as to thwart the purpose of the legislation,\" and found that the $160 warranty surcharge did just that.  The court stated that the surcharge contravened the \"legislative intent\" behind Sec. 1176 and was thus \"inappropriate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, the court relied by analogy upon the New York \"Lemon Law\" cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Similarly, if Ford had simply increased the wholesale price of its vehicle and reflected this increased price in its suggested retail price for automobiles sold in Maine, the Court would likely have reached a different conclusion.   Ford, however, increased its warranty parts reimbursement to dealers only to recoup these costs directly from dealers on the same parts statement.  Ford's actions fly in the face of Sec. 1176....  Ford may increase its wholesale automobile prices in Maine without a corresponding increase elsewhere in the country.  If Ford chooses to increase its wholesale prices in Maine, however, it must revise its so-called Monroney stickers for automobiles sold in Maine so that the increased price of automobiles is not shouldered only by the dealer....  This Court finds that Ford's warranty parity surcharge, as it is currently structured, is illegal and enjoins Ford from continuing with this practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).  The court therefore ruled that Ford may pass on the increased costs of compliance, but may do so only if it also instituted a corresponding increase in each car's \"sticker\" price.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  This sticker price issue had never been briefed by the parties, although it was discussed during the summary judgment hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The March Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties moved to modify the February Order.  The Dealers requested that the district court issue a declaratory judgment declaring the warranty parity surcharge illegal and order Ford to refund the warranty surcharges already paid.  Ford requested that the court modify its order to allow Ford to implement its price increase by including an additional amount on the dealer invoice, rather than by increasing the Monroney sticker price.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In an order issued March 30, 1994, the district court denied Ford's request, stating that Ford was effectively seeking a \"prospective advisory opinion\" on an issue not ripe for disposition.  The court then denied the Dealers' request for a refund of the already-paid surcharges, explaining that its February Order was only to apply prospectively.  The March Order did little to clarify the court's original ruling, but merely reiterated that \"Ford's warranty parity surcharge, as it is currently structured, is illegal.\"   The court also dismissed the remaining counts of the Dealers' Complaint.  Both parties appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and read the record in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all inferences in the non-moving party's favor.  LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1398, 128 L.Ed.2d 72 (1994).  We likewise afford de novo review to a district court's dismissal of a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., 14 F.3d 697, 700 (1st Cir.1994) (citations omitted).  We must accept the allegations of the complaint as true, and if, under any theory, the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action in accordance with the law, we must deny the motion to dismiss.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Parties' Presentation of the Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, the parties offer disparate interpretations of the district court's ruling.  Because of their different versions, their framing of the issues relevant to this appeal differs broadly.  The Dealers insist that the \"central issue\" in this action is whether Ford's $160 surcharge violates Sec. 1176, as they repeatedly contend the district court found, and \"what relief should flow to the Dealers.\"   Ford, on the other hand, argues that the district court ruled that Ford may institute a wholesale price increase, but only if it also increases the Monroney sticker price.  Ford's primary argument on appeal, accordingly, is that this sticker price increase is not required by Sec. 1176, and indeed, brings Sec. 1176 into conflict with federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortunately, our analysis of the issues raised on appeal does not require that we accept one party's \"version\" over the other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Because we are able here to analyze each of the parties' arguments without addressing the dispute over the district court's ruling, the ambiguities in the court's opinion are rendered irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The \"Sticker Price\" Increase Requirement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address Ford's argument that the district court erred by interpreting Sec. 1176 to require that a wholesale price increase must be matched by a corresponding increase to the suggested retail, or \"sticker\" price.  Ford contends that there is absolutely nothing in the language of Sec. 1176 to even suggest this requirement, and that it likewise cannot be justified by some vague reference to \"legislative intent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this issue involves the interpretation of a Maine state statute, we are bound to apply the principles set forth by Maine's Supreme Judicial Court.  That court has repeatedly held that courts must look to the language of a statute to find its meaning.  State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., 513 A.2d 283, 286 (Me.1986).  When interpreting that language, courts must give the unambiguous wording of a statute its plain and ordinary meaning.  Stanley v. Tilcon Maine, Inc., 541 A.2d 951, 952 (Me.1988).  Only when the language of the statute is ambiguous should courts look beyond the words of the statute to its history, policy or other extrinsic aids to ascertain statutory intent.  Central Maine Power Co. v. Maine Pub. Utils.  Comm'n, 436 A.2d 880, 885 (Me.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of this issue has two components.  First, we must address whether, as an initial matter, the district court correctly rejected the Dealers' arguments that Ford had no right to pass on its increased costs of doing business resulting from compliance with Sec. 1176.  Then we examine whether the court's order requiring Ford to institute a sticker price increase was supported by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the language of Sec. 1176 prohibits a manufacturer from increasing vehicle prices in order to recover its increased compliance costs.  The statute says nothing about wholesale or retail prices, and apparently leaves the manufacturer free to increase wholesale prices, and the dealer to increase retail prices.  The legislative history of the amended statute also does not indicate that the Maine legislature intended to set price controls or to force manufacturers to wholly bear the costs of compliance.  Moreover, as Ford points out, it is quite commonplace for manufacturers and other regulated entities to pass on to retailers and consumers their costs of complying with regulatory statutes.  This is so even when the costs are passed on to the \"beneficiaries\" of the regulations.  See, e.g., Motor &amp; Equip.  Mfrs. Ass'n v. E.P.A., 627 F.2d 1095, 1118 (D.C.Cir.1979) (environmental regulations will increase cost of new cars for consumers), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 952, 100 S.Ct. 2917, 64 L.Ed.2d 808 (1980);  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. Abrams, 684 F.Supp. 804, 806 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (charges for manufacturers' compliance with New York's \"Lemon Law\" may be passed on to auto consumers).  Therefore, we hold that the district court properly ruled that Sec. 1176 does not prohibit Ford or other manufacturers from recovering their costs of compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as the statute contains no language restricting cost recovery, it also contains no language conditioning cost recovery.  The statute deals solely with warranty reimbursement transactions between manufacturer and dealer, and no mention is made of any other contingencies.  The Dealers have not pointed to one word contained in Sec. 1176, nor can we find one, that suggests that the statute contemplates anything other than the limited subject of warranty reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history to Sec. 1176 also lacks any indication that the Maine legislature intended to condition a manufacturer's recovery of its compliance costs.  As we noted above, Maine law initially required only that manufacturers \"adequately and fairly compensate each of its motor vehicle dealers for labor and parts.\"   When the Maine legislature amended Sec. 1176 in 1980 to provide that reimbursement for labor be at the customary retail rate, the legislature explained in its Statement of Fact:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>With their superior bargaining position, automakers have in the past forced dealers to accept reimbursement at a rate substantially lower than the dealers' usual retail rate.  The net effect has been that, through an inflated labor rate, non-warranty customers have subsidized automakers who were unwilling to pay the fair and full price for repairs made necessary when their automobiles failed to meet warranty standards.  This section prevents recurrence of this problem....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Me.L.D. 1878, 109th Leg., 2d Sess.  (1980) (Statement of Fact) (emphasis added).  In 1991, when the legislature amended Sec. 1176 to require that dealers be compensated for parts at the customary retail rate, it stated only that the purpose of the amendment was to make compensation for parts the same as compensation for labor.  Me.L.D. 1235, 115th Leg., 1st Sess.  (March 21, 1991) (Statement of Fact).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite simply, this sparse legislative history fails to suggest any statutory purpose or legislative intent to prevent or condition manufacturers' cost recovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  It certainly does not indicate, either expressly or implicitly, that warranty reimbursement costs cannot be passed on by manufacturers to dealers, and then from dealers to consumers.  It simply and solely regulates the rates at which manufacturers must reimburse dealers for warranty labor and parts.  We therefore cannot find, nor can we reasonably or fairly infer, that the legislature intended to prohibit or condition manufacturer cost recovery.  In light of this complete dearth of statutory or historical evidence supporting the district court's order that Ford revise its Monroney stickers, we must find that the district court's order is completely unsupported by the state law, and therefore erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making its determination, the district court relied by analogy on the New York \"Lemon Law\" cases.  This reliance is misplaced.  In State of New York v. Ford Motor Co., the New York Court of Appeals held that Ford's written warranty, which stated that the retail purchaser of a vehicle would be required to pay the first $100 of any warranty repair charge, violated the New York state \"Lemon Law,\" N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law Sec. 198-a (McKinney's 1983).  State of New York v. Ford Motor Co., 74 N.Y.2d 495, 549 N.Y.S.2d 368, 370-71, 548 N.E.2d 906, 908-09 (1989).  The court's ruling rested entirely on the plain language of the statute, which provided that when a new motor vehicle does not conform to all express warranties for the earlier of its first two years or 18,000 miles, \"the manufacturer ... shall correct said nonconformity ... at no charge to the consumer.\"  (emphasis added).  As the court recognized, \"[i]t is difficult to imagine the disputed $100 deductible being more easily resolved\" than by the plain, unequivocal language of the statute.  State of New York, 549 N.Y.S.2d at 371, 548 N.E.2d at 909.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the New York court's ruling on the $100 deductible, Ford discontinued the deductible, but, along with other manufacturers, instituted a Lemon Law-related surcharge assessed on all vehicles sold in New York.  Ford, at its own initiative, placed this surcharge on its Monroney sticker, describing it as \"N.Y. Mandatory Repair Coverage Option.\"  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n, 684 F.Supp. at 805.   When the New York legislature passed a law prohibiting manufacturers from placing this item on the Monroney sticker, the district court struck down the law as an unconstitutional restraint on lawful commercial speech.  Id. at 808.   In so doing, the court noted that \"it is entirely lawful for an automobile manufacturer to impose on its customers a charge resulting from the costs of compliance with the Lemon Law.\"  Id. at 806.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Lemon Law cases offer little support for the district court's order here.  First, the plain language of the Lemon Law specifically prohibited the deductible at issue before the state court, whereas the Maine statute involved here does not either expressly or implicitly require the district court's result.  More importantly, although the New York district court recognized that Ford could recover its costs of compliance with the Lemon Law, the court did not require a corresponding sticker price increase;  rather, Ford instituted such an increase in that situation voluntarily, as a result of its own business decisions.  Its sticker price increase was not mandated or suggested by the Lemon Law itself, nor by the state court's opinions.  In the case at bar, the district court's reliance on the Lemon Law cases to support its own ruling that Ford must increase its Monroney sticker price is entirely unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court's order cannot be salvaged by its references to some unspecified and vague notion of \"legislative intent.\"   It is not appropriate for a federal district court, however well-intentioned, to set forth a rule unsupported by a state statute.  As we have repeatedly warned, federal courts must take great caution \"when blazing new state-law trials.\"  Pearson v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 979 F.2d 254, 259 (1st Cir.1992).  Because nothing in Sec. 1176 or its history conditions cost recovery by a manufacturer, the district court was not authorized to impose such a condition on the basis of some inferred legislative policy.  The court therefore overstepped the bounds of its authority and entered territory properly left to the Maine legislature when it ordered Ford to revise its Monroney stickers on cars sold in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the district court's order requiring Ford to institute a Monroney sticker price increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. The Dealers' Claims for \"Disgorgement\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dealers argue that the district court erred in refusing to order Ford to repay to the Dealers all funds collected through the \"illegal\" warranty parity surcharge.  The Dealers explain that in requesting the return of the surcharges, they were seeking the equitable remedy of restitution, the disgorgement of funds obtained under an unlawful policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The district court denied the Dealers' request for \"disgorgement\" on the grounds that the Dealers may have actually passed on the cost of the surcharge to their customers, and therefore, presumably, the Dealers sustained no actual injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their contention, the Dealers explain in their brief that the Maine legislature \"intended and required that Ford pay more\" than it had previously been paying.  (Emphasis in original).  The Dealers argue that in amending Sec. 1176, the legislature \"intended that the financial burden of supplying Ford's warranty be borne by Ford, not by the Dealers,\" and that Sec. 1176 is a \"cost-shifting\" statute.  Because the warranty parity surcharge recovered the very funds that Ford was paying under the amended Sec. 1176, Ford was \"illegally\" paying to the Dealers less than was statutorily required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument rests on the unfounded premise that Sec. 1176 prevents Ford from recovering its compliance costs.  It is clear that in amending Sec. 1176, the Maine legislature intended that the manufacturers \"pay more\" in warranty reimbursements.  It is not at all clear, however, that the legislature intended that manufacturers simply absorb those costs, and could not pass them on by means of a wholesale cost increase, a dealer surcharge, or a retail cost increase.  There is no support for the Dealers' contention that Sec. 1176 is a \"cost-shifting\" statute, and as we explained, we will not infer such legislative intent without any evidence whatsoever.  The Dealers' position that Sec. 1176 prevents Ford from recovering its costs is therefore incorrect.  It follows that their contention that the surcharges--Ford's chosen mechanism for cost recovery--were unlawfully collected, is also incorrect.  Because the surcharges were not unlawful, then, Ford was not unjustly enriched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, after carefully reviewing the entire record, we agree with the district court that the Dealers have not shown that they actually absorbed the cost of the surcharges and did not pass them on to their customers in the form of higher prices.  If the Dealers have passed on their costs, then awarding restitution of the surcharges would result in a windfall double recovery by the Dealers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, neither the language or purpose of the statute, nor the facts on record, support the Dealers' claim for restitution of surcharges already collected by Ford.  We therefore affirm the district court's rejection of this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. The Dealers' Other Claims</p>\n    <p>1. Robinson-Patman Act Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dealers argued before the district court that Ford dealers in neighboring states, such as New Hampshire, are in the same geographical marketing area as the Maine Dealers.  By imposing additional costs in Maine but not in those other states, the Dealers contended that Ford violated the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 13(a).  The Dealers argue on appeal that, assuming the district court properly denied disgorgement of the surcharges, the court's dismissal of their claims for price discrimination under relevant portions of the Robinson-Patman Act was erroneous, and that these claims should have been left open for a trial on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard for reviewing a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal is clear:  a complaint is to be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, here the Dealers.  Finnern v. Sunday River Skiway Corp., 984 F.2d 530, 534 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted).  Dismissal is appropriate only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts in support of their claim which would entitle them to relief.  Finnern, 984 F.2d at 534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent portion of the Robinson-Patman Act provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, ... where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. Sec. 13(a) (1988).  The Act, however, also creates a \"safe harbor\" based on reasonable price differentials \"which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered....\"  Id.   The district court ruled that Ford would not be in violation of the Act if it could establish that its cost of selling vehicles in Maine were reasonably related to its differences in costs--in other words, that it fell within the \"safe harbor.\"   The Supreme Court has explained that the Robinson-Patman Act was enacted to \"curb and prohibit all devices by which large buyers gained discriminatory preferences over smaller ones by virtue of their greater purchasing power.\"  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Henry Broch &amp; Co., 363 U.S. 166, 168, 80 S.Ct. 1158, 1160, 4 L.Ed.2d 1124 (1960).  The Act was an amendment to the antitrust laws, specifically the Clayton Antitrust Act.  Id. at 167-168, 80 S.Ct. at 1159-1160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading of the Dealers' allegations, viewed in the light most favorable to them, does not support a claim that Ford's increase in its vehicle prices was a price differential of the type prohibited by the Robinson-Patman Act.  Any differences in vehicle prices resulting from the higher warranty reimbursement levels would fall squarely within the safe harbor allowed by the Act, and therefore be lawful.  Because the Dealers have not alleged facts sufficient to sustain their Robinson-Patman claims, we cannot agree that these \"issues\" remain open for trial.  We therefore find that the district court properly dismissed the Dealers' Robinson-Patman claims, and we affirm this dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Claims under 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1174(1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dealers contend that the district court erroneously dismissed their claims that Ford had engaged in unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive practices, in violation of 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1174(1).  They argue that those claims should be tried on their merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dealers' Sec. 1174(1) claims, however, rest upon their allegations that Ford's warranty surcharge was illegal.  As we held above, the surcharge did not violate Sec. 1176.  Thus, in light of the fact that Ford committed no unlawful acts in instituting its warranty surcharge, the Dealers' Sec. 1174(1) claims necessarily collapse.  We therefore hold that these claims were properly dismissed, and we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Claims under 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1182</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Dealers assert that the district court erred in dismissing their claims that Ford's warranty surcharge violated public policy within the meaning of 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1182.  Section 1182 authorizes courts to grant declaratory and injunctive relief for practices in violation of certain Maine statutes, including Sec. 1176.  Because, as we have explained, we find that Ford did not violate Sec. 1176, the Dealers' claims under Sec. 1182 are moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's opinion is affirmed in part and reversed in part.  Remanded for actions consistent with this opinion.  No costs to either party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Ford states that a dealer could obtain a higher reimbursement mark-up on a particular part merely by submitting the necessary documentation to Ford, in accordance with Sec. 1176 and Ford's established reimbursement procedures</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Dealers submitted the affidavits of two dealers attesting that they paid more in surcharges than they received in increased reimbursement under the new policy.  Ford points out, however, that while some dealers pay more in a given month under the new policy, others pay less and receive more.  The surcharge, Ford stated during oral argument before this court, was calculated to recoup Ford's increased costs of doing business over time, spreading those costs evenly among the dealers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Ford also raised challenges to the statute on various federal statutory and constitutional grounds.  The district court rejected these challenges, and Ford has not raised them in this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Dealers also argued that, in the alternative, the only lawful way for Ford to recoup its increased costs was to institute a wholesale price increase nationwide.  The district court rejected this suggestion, and the Dealers do not raise it on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> See discussion infra regarding the district court's use of the New York Lemon Law cases</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1232 requires that auto manufacturers affix a label, the so-called \"Monroney sticker,\" on each new automobile, disclosing information such as the suggested retail price, the price for each accessory or optional equipment, and transportation charges</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The dealer invoice, unlike the Monroney sticker, shows the price actually paid to Ford by the dealer</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We do not believe, however, that the Dealers are correct in their contention that the district court found the surcharge \"illegal\" in and of itself.  In offering this interpretation, the Dealers take the court's use of the word \"illegal\" out of the sentence and out of its context.  The district court did not state that the surcharge was per se illegal, but rather that it was illegal \"as it is currently structured\" and allowed a wholesale price increase only on the condition that it be accompanied by a sticker price increase.  Indeed, the court stated that if Ford had instituted an accompanying sticker price increase, the court may have ruled differently</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In fact, if anything, the legislative history belies the Dealers' contention that the statute was amended to \"protect\" dealers.  We think that an objective reading of the legislative history indicates the legislature decided that warranty reimbursement levels would be at retail rates, in order to prevent non-warranty customers from being charged prices much higher than the customary retail rates.  Therefore, if anything, the statute was arguably meant to protect non-warranty consumers from inflated prices charged by dealers who are attempting to maintain their average profit margins in the face of a manufacturer's below-retail reimbursement rates</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Because we find the district court's order erroneous, we need not address Ford's arguments that the order brings Sec. 1176 into conflict with federal law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The Dealers rely on Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 402, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 1091, 90 L.Ed. 1332 (1946) and Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. 412, 424, 107 S.Ct. 1831, 1839, 95 L.Ed.2d 365 (1987) in support of their contentions.  However, as revealed by our analysis, these cases do not control here.  The central issue in Porter v. Warner Holding Co. was whether the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, establishing national rent controls, limited the power of federal courts to order restitution of excessive rents collected in violation of the Act.  Porter, 328 U.S. at 396, 66 S.Ct. at 1088.   The improper profits at issue in the Porter case were rents collected in direct violation of a statute specifically establishing price controls.  As we discussed above, Sec. 1176 does not establish price controls, nor mandate that manufacturers solely bear the burden of compliance.  To the contrary, Sec. 1176 merely sets forth warranty reimbursement levels, and leaves unregulated the methods by which affected parties may bear or pass on the costs of compliance</p>\n        <p>The Tull case is also inapposite.  The \"quotation\" offered by the Dealers in their brief was pulled out of the most tangential dictum from that case, during which the Court was merely discussing (and rejecting) the government's analogy between civil penalties under the Clean Water Act and equitable actions of disgorgement.  Moreover, not only is the Dealers' proffered \"quotation\" from that case taken out of context, but manipulated so as to acquire a meaning nothing like the original.  We do not appreciate such fast-and-loose use of case law.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 1176 (Me.Rev.Stat.Ann., tit. 10 Sec. 1176 (West 1994)).  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that in order to comply with the Maine statute, Ford must revise the window stickers on its cars sold in Maine to reflect the surcharge Ford had instituted to recover its costs of complying with Sec. 1176.  The district court refused, however, to award damages or restitution to the Dealers on their claims that Ford had violated the statute.  In addition, the district court dismissed the Dealers' remaining claims under the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 13(a) (1988), and 10 M.R.S.A. Secs. 1174(1) and 1182 (Me.Rev.Stat.Ann., tit. 10 Secs. 1174(1), 1182 (West 1994)).  For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Manufacturer-Dealer Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ford manufactures automobiles and sells them through a nationwide network of franchise dealers.  The franchise agreement, called the Sales and Service Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), defines the manufacturer-dealer relationship.  Ford offers a warranty with all new cars.  Under the warranty, certain repairs, replacements, or adjustments are made free of charge to the consumer.  The Dealers are required under their Agreements with Ford to perform labor and to provide parts in satisfaction of the warranties.  Ford is obligated both under the Agreements and under Maine statute to reimburse the Dealers for parts used and warranty work performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, and until 1993, Ford reimbursed the Dealers for parts under a uniform national reimbursement formula.  Under this nationwide formula, each dealer is eligible to be reimbursed at wholesale cost, plus 30-40 percent above cost, depending on the vehicle model year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. State Legislation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State of Maine regulates the manufacturer-dealer relationship by statute, see 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1171 et seq., including warranty reimbursement levels.  Originally, Maine's warranty reimbursement statute required car manufacturers, including Ford, to \"adequately and fairly compensate the franchisee for any parts provided in satisfaction of a warranty created by the franchisor.\"   10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1176 (1980).  In 1991, however, Sec. 1176 was amended to require manufacturers to reimburse dealers at retail-equivalent rates.  It currently provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>If a motor vehicle franchisor requires or permits a motor vehicle franchisee to perform labor or provide parts in satisfaction of a warranty created by the franchisor, the franchisor shall properly and promptly fulfill its warranty obligations, in the case of motor vehicles over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating, shall adequately and fairly compensate the franchisee for any parts so provided and, in the case of all other motor vehicles, shall reimburse the franchisee for any parts so provided at the retail rate customarily charged by that franchisee for the same parts when not provided in satisfaction of a warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1176 (1991) (Me.Rev.Stat.Ann., tit. 10 Sec. 1176 (West 1994)) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, the amended statute requires warranty parts reimbursement \"at the retail rate customarily charged for the same parts when not provided in satisfaction of a warranty.\"   10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1176 (emphasis added).  The statute requires a match between the warranty part and the part actually sold by that particular dealer to a non-warranty customer.  For example, a particular dealer's profit margin on the retail sale of a headlight cannot be used to determine the appropriate reimbursement percentage when the dealer, or another dealer, replaces a water pump under warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Events Leading to this Lawsuit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the 1991 amendment to Sec. 1176, several Maine dealers notified Ford that the new law entitled them to higher warranty reimbursement.  In 1992, one Maine dealer filed claims in small claims court for reimbursement.  The small claims court dismissed those claims because the dealer had not submitted an adequate claim for reimbursement to Ford, which it found to be a prerequisite under the statute to reimbursement recovery.  Darling's Bangor Ford/VW/Audi v. Ford Motor Co., No. BAN 92-sc-229 (Me.Dist.Ct. 3, S.Pen., Oct. 20, 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to this dealer's challenge, however, Ford revised its reimbursement policy in Maine, and announced to its Maine dealers on April 1, 1993 that the \"cost-plus\" mark-up for parts reimbursement would be raised for all Maine dealers to 63 percent.  This percentage corresponds to the percentage over cost used to determine the manufacturer's suggested retail price of parts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  With this announcement, however, Ford also stated that in order to recover this increase in its costs of doing business in Maine, it would also increase the wholesale price of each new vehicle sold, through assessment of a surcharge of approximately $160 per vehicle.  The surcharge, called the \"warranty parity surcharge,\" would appear on each dealer's monthly parts invoice in the month following the sale.  The surcharge was imposed based on the number of cars sold, without regard to whether the dealer actually performed warranty work in that month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dealers filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maine, alleging that the surcharge was unlawful, requesting that the court enjoin the surcharge and order Ford to \"disgorge\" the surcharge monies already recovered.  The Dealers argued that Sec. 1176 not only required higher warranty reimbursement levels, but also prohibited Ford from raising wholesale prices to recover the costs of paying those higher reimbursement levels.  They argued that the surcharge effectively negated the higher reimbursement levels required by Sec. 1176, in contravention of the legislative purpose of the amended statute.  The Dealers also alleged that Ford's surcharge violated the Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act and the Robinson-Patman Act, and made claims under other Maine statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ford moved to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) or alternatively for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 on the grounds that, as a matter of law, the warranty reimbursement level and the surcharge were lawful.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The Dealers also moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a final injunction against the price increase, and requesting damages and other relief.  They argued that any price increase to recover the reimbursement rate required by Sec. 1176 was itself a violation of the statute.  They contended that the Maine legislature, in amending Sec. 1176, had intended that the cost of Ford's warranty be borne by Ford, and not by the Dealers, and that the surcharge improperly shifted the financial burden back to the Dealers.  According to the Dealers, Sec. 1176 was about \"dealers' rights,\" and thus any wholesale price increase was unlawful.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The District Court's Orders</p>\n    <p>1. The February Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled on the parties' motions on February 15, 1994, treating both motions as ones for summary judgment, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></span>.   The parties offer vastly different interpretations of the February Order.  We acknowledge that the court's conclusions are not crystal-clear.  We do not think, however, that the court's decision is fairly subject to such disparate readings as given by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court denied the Dealers' request for damages based on Ford's alleged past failures to reimburse the Dealers according to the amended Sec. 1176.  The court ruled that the Dealers did not make an adequately particularized claim to Ford prior to bringing suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then addressed the Dealers' objections to Ford's reimbursement policy and warranty parity surcharge.  Regarding the Dealers' arguments that the 63 percent reimbursement rate was not sufficient under Sec. 1176, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The plain language of Sec. 1176 requires that Ford reimburse its dealers \"at the retail rate customarily charged by that franchisee for the same parts when not provided in satisfaction of a warranty.\"   10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1176 (Supp.1993) (emphasis added).  Literally this requires Ford to pay a dealer the same rate that that particular dealer would have charged for that particular part if the dealer had provided it to a nonwarranty customer.  Ford's policy of reimbursing dealers at the suggested list price may or may not satisfy Sec. 1176 depending on whether the individual dealer customarily charges more or less than Ford's suggested list price....  As discussed above, the Dealers have not submitted a sufficiently particularized claim to Ford in order to recover for Ford's past alleged underpayments.   Moreover, the Dealers have failed to submit enough factual material from which the Court can determine whether Ford's practice of reimbursing dealers at 63% above dealer cost violates Sec. 1176.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these grounds, the court denied the Dealers' motion for partial summary judgment, declining to find Ford liable for damages, declare Ford's current reimbursement rate illegal, or issue an injunction requiring that Ford reimburse the Dealers at a higher rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then addressed the Dealers' arguments that the warranty parity surcharge violates Sec. 1176.  The court first rejected the Dealers' claim that Ford has no right to recover its increased costs of compliance with the Maine statute.  The court went on, however, to state that Ford may not recover its cost \"in such a way as to thwart the purpose of the legislation,\" and found that the $160 warranty surcharge did just that.  The court stated that the surcharge contravened the \"legislative intent\" behind Sec. 1176 and was thus \"inappropriate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, the court relied by analogy upon the New York \"Lemon Law\" cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Similarly, if Ford had simply increased the wholesale price of its vehicle and reflected this increased price in its suggested retail price for automobiles sold in Maine, the Court would likely have reached a different conclusion.   Ford, however, increased its warranty parts reimbursement to dealers only to recoup these costs directly from dealers on the same parts statement.  Ford's actions fly in the face of Sec. 1176....  Ford may increase its wholesale automobile prices in Maine without a corresponding increase elsewhere in the country.  If Ford chooses to increase its wholesale prices in Maine, however, it must revise its so-called Monroney stickers for automobiles sold in Maine so that the increased price of automobiles is not shouldered only by the dealer....  This Court finds that Ford's warranty parity surcharge, as it is currently structured, is illegal and enjoins Ford from continuing with this practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).  The court therefore ruled that Ford may pass on the increased costs of compliance, but may do so only if it also instituted a corresponding increase in each car's \"sticker\" price.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  This sticker price issue had never been briefed by the parties, although it was discussed during the summary judgment hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The March Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties moved to modify the February Order.  The Dealers requested that the district court issue a declaratory judgment declaring the warranty parity surcharge illegal and order Ford to refund the warranty surcharges already paid.  Ford requested that the court modify its order to allow Ford to implement its price increase by including an additional amount on the dealer invoice, rather than by increasing the Monroney sticker price.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In an order issued March 30, 1994, the district court denied Ford's request, stating that Ford was effectively seeking a \"prospective advisory opinion\" on an issue not ripe for disposition.  The court then denied the Dealers' request for a refund of the already-paid surcharges, explaining that its February Order was only to apply prospectively.  The March Order did little to clarify the court's original ruling, but merely reiterated that \"Ford's warranty parity surcharge, as it is currently structured, is illegal.\"   The court also dismissed the remaining counts of the Dealers' Complaint.  Both parties appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

The Parties' Presentation of the Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, the parties offer disparate interpretations of the district court's ruling.  Because of their different versions, their framing of the issues relevant to this appeal differs broadly.  The Dealers insist that the \"central issue\" in this action is whether Ford's $160 surcharge violates Sec. 1176, as they repeatedly contend the district court found, and \"what relief should flow to the Dealers.\"   Ford, on the other hand, argues that the district court ruled that Ford may institute a wholesale price increase, but only if it also increases the Monroney sticker price.  Ford's primary argument on appeal, accordingly, is that this sticker price increase is not required by Sec. 1176, and indeed, brings Sec. 1176 into conflict with federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortunately, our analysis of the issues raised on appeal does not require that we accept one party's \"version\" over the other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Because we are able here to analyze each of the parties' arguments without addressing the dispute over the district court's ruling, the ambiguities in the court's opinion are rendered irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The \"Sticker Price\" Increase Requirement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address Ford's argument that the district court erred by interpreting Sec. 1176 to require that a wholesale price increase must be matched by a corresponding increase to the suggested retail, or \"sticker\" price.  Ford contends that there is absolutely nothing in the language of Sec. 1176 to even suggest this requirement, and that it likewise cannot be justified by some vague reference to \"legislative intent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this issue involves the interpretation of a Maine state statute, we are bound to apply the principles set forth by Maine's Supreme Judicial Court.  That court has repeatedly held that courts must look to the language of a statute to find its meaning.  State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088460\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088460/state-farm-mut-v-universal-underwriters-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span>, 286 (Me.1986).  When interpreting that language, courts must give the unambiguous wording of a statute its plain and ordinary meaning.  Stanley v.

Only when the language of the statute is ambiguous should courts look beyond the words of the statute to its history, policy or other extrinsic aids to ascertain statutory intent.  Central Maine Power Co. v. Maine Pub. Utils.  Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1521541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1521541/central-me-power-co-v-maine-pub-util/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span>, 885 (Me.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of this issue has two components.  First, we must address whether, as an initial matter, the district court correctly rejected the Dealers' arguments that Ford had no right to pass on its increased costs of doing business resulting from compliance with Sec. 1176.  Then we examine whether the court's order requiring Ford to institute a sticker price increase was supported by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the language of Sec. 1176 prohibits a manufacturer from increasing vehicle prices in order to recover its increased compliance costs.  The statute says nothing about wholesale or retail prices, and apparently leaves the manufacturer free to increase wholesale prices, and the dealer to increase retail prices.  The legislative history of the amended statute also does not indicate that the Maine legislature intended to set price controls or to force manufacturers to wholly bear the costs of compliance.  Moreover, as Ford points out, it is quite commonplace for manufacturers and other regulated entities to pass on to retailers and consumers their costs of complying with regulatory statutes.  This is so even when the costs are passed on to the \"beneficiaries\" of the regulations.  See, e.g., Motor &amp; Equip.  Mfrs. Ass'n v. E.P.A., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381241\"><a href=\"/opinion/381241/the-motor-and-equipment-manufacturers-association-inc-v-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></a></span>, 1118 (D.C.Cir.1979) (environmental regulations will increase cost of new cars for consumers), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 806 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (charges for manufacturers' compliance with New York's \"Lemon Law\" may be passed on to auto consumers).  Therefore, we hold that the district court properly ruled that Sec. 1176 does not prohibit Ford or other manufacturers from recovering their costs of compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as the statute contains no language restricting cost recovery, it also contains no language conditioning cost recovery.  The statute deals solely with warranty reimbursement transactions between manufacturer and dealer, and no mention is made of any other contingencies.  The Dealers have not pointed to one word contained in Sec. 1176, nor can we find one, that suggests that the statute contemplates anything other than the limited subject of warranty reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history to Sec. 1176 also lacks any indication that the Maine legislature intended to condition a manufacturer's recovery of its compliance costs.  As we noted above, Maine law initially required only that manufacturers \"adequately and fairly compensate each of its motor vehicle dealers for labor and parts.\"   When the Maine legislature amended Sec. 1176 in 1980 to provide that reimbursement for labor be at the customary retail rate, the legislature explained in its Statement of Fact:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>With their superior bargaining position, automakers have in the past forced dealers to accept reimbursement at a rate substantially lower than the dealers' usual retail rate.  The net effect has been that, through an inflated labor rate, non-warranty customers have subsidized automakers who were unwilling to pay the fair and full price for repairs made necessary when their automobiles failed to meet warranty standards.  This section prevents recurrence of this problem....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Me.L.D. 1878, 109th Leg., 2d Sess.  (1980) (Statement of Fact) (emphasis added).  In 1991, when the legislature amended Sec. 1176 to require that dealers be compensated for parts at the customary retail rate, it stated only that the purpose of the amendment was to make compensation for parts the same as compensation for labor.  Me.L.D. 1235, 115th Leg., 1st Sess.  (March 21, 1991) (Statement of Fact).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite simply, this sparse legislative history fails to suggest any statutory purpose or legislative intent to prevent or condition manufacturers' cost recovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  It certainly does not indicate, either expressly or implicitly, that warranty reimbursement costs cannot be passed on by manufacturers to dealers, and then from dealers to consumers.  It simply and solely regulates the rates at which manufacturers must reimburse dealers for warranty labor and parts.  We therefore cannot find, nor can we reasonably or fairly infer, that the legislature intended to prohibit or condition manufacturer cost recovery.  In light of this complete dearth of statutory or historical evidence supporting the district court's order that Ford revise its Monroney stickers, we must find that the district court's order is completely unsupported by the state law, and therefore erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making its determination, the district court relied by analogy on the New York \"Lemon Law\" cases.  This reliance is misplaced.  In State of New York v. Ford Motor Co., the New York Court of Appeals held that Ford's written warranty, which stated that the retail purchaser of a vehicle would be required to pay the first $100 of any warranty repair charge, violated the New York state \"Lemon Law,\" N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law Sec. 198-a (McKinney's 1983).

The court's ruling rested entirely on the plain language of the statute, which provided that when a new motor vehicle does not conform to all express warranties for the earlier of its first two years or 18,000 miles, \"the manufacturer ... shall correct said nonconformity ... at no charge to the consumer.\"  (emphasis added).  As the court recognized, \"[i]t is difficult to imagine the disputed $100 deductible being more easily resolved\" than by the plain, unequivocal language of the statute.

Ford, at its own initiative, placed this surcharge on its Monroney sticker, describing it as \"N.Y.

When the New York legislature passed a law prohibiting manufacturers from placing this item on the Monroney sticker, the district court struck down the law as an unconstitutional restraint on lawful commercial speech.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1896009\"><a href=\"/opinion/1896009/motor-vehicle-mfrs-assn-v-abrams/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 808. </a></span>  In so doing, the court noted that \"it is entirely lawful for an automobile manufacturer to impose on its customers a charge resulting from the costs of compliance with the Lemon Law.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1896009\"><a href=\"/opinion/1896009/motor-vehicle-mfrs-assn-v-abrams/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 806.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Lemon Law cases offer little support for the district court's order here.  First, the plain language of the Lemon Law specifically prohibited the deductible at issue before the state court, whereas the Maine statute involved here does not either expressly or implicitly require the district court's result.  More importantly, although the New York district court recognized that Ford could recover its costs of compliance with the Lemon Law, the court did not require a corresponding sticker price increase;  rather, Ford instituted such an increase in that situation voluntarily, as a result of its own business decisions.  Its sticker price increase was not mandated or suggested by the Lemon Law itself, nor by the state court's opinions.  In the case at bar, the district court's reliance on the Lemon Law cases to support its own ruling that Ford must increase its Monroney sticker price is entirely unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court's order cannot be salvaged by its references to some unspecified and vague notion of \"legislative intent.\"   It is not appropriate for a federal district court, however well-intentioned, to set forth a rule unsupported by a state statute.  As we have repeatedly warned, federal courts must take great caution \"when blazing new state-law trials.\"  Pearson v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins.

Because nothing in Sec. 1176 or its history conditions cost recovery by a manufacturer, the district court was not authorized to impose such a condition on the basis of some inferred legislative policy.  The court therefore overstepped the bounds of its authority and entered territory properly left to the Maine legislature when it ordered Ford to revise its Monroney stickers on cars sold in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the district court's order requiring Ford to institute a Monroney sticker price increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

The Dealers argue that in amending Sec. 1176, the legislature \"intended that the financial burden of supplying Ford's warranty be borne by Ford, not by the Dealers,\" and that Sec. 1176 is a \"cost-shifting\" statute.  Because the warranty parity surcharge recovered the very funds that Ford was paying under the amended Sec. 1176, Ford was \"illegally\" paying to the Dealers less than was statutorily required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument rests on the unfounded premise that Sec. 1176 prevents Ford from recovering its compliance costs.  It is clear that in amending Sec. 1176, the Maine legislature intended that the manufacturers \"pay more\" in warranty reimbursements.  It is not at all clear, however, that the legislature intended that manufacturers simply absorb those costs, and could not pass them on by means of a wholesale cost increase, a dealer surcharge, or a retail cost increase.  There is no support for the Dealers' contention that Sec. 1176 is a \"cost-shifting\" statute, and as we explained, we will not infer such legislative intent without any evidence whatsoever.  The Dealers' position that Sec. 1176 prevents Ford from recovering its costs is therefore incorrect.  It follows that their contention that the surcharges--Ford's chosen mechanism for cost recovery--were unlawfully collected, is also incorrect.  Because the surcharges were not unlawful, then, Ford was not unjustly enriched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, after carefully reviewing the entire record, we agree with the district court that the Dealers have not shown that they actually absorbed the cost of the surcharges and did not pass them on to their customers in the form of higher prices.  If the Dealers have passed on their costs, then awarding restitution of the surcharges would result in a windfall double recovery by the Dealers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, neither the language or purpose of the statute, nor the facts on record, support the Dealers' claim for restitution of surcharges already collected by Ford.  We therefore affirm the district court's rejection of this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. The Dealers' Other Claims</p>\n    <p>1. Robinson-Patman Act Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dealers argued before the district court that Ford dealers in neighboring states, such as New Hampshire, are in the same geographical marketing area as the Maine Dealers.  By imposing additional costs in Maine but not in those other states, the Dealers contended that Ford violated the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 13(a).  The Dealers argue on appeal that, assuming the district court properly denied disgorgement of the surcharges, the court's dismissal of their claims for price discrimination under relevant portions of the Robinson-Patman Act was erroneous, and that these claims should have been left open for a trial on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard for reviewing a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal is clear:  a complaint is to be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, here the Dealers.

The Act was an amendment to the antitrust laws, specifically the Clayton Antitrust Act.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106062\"><a href=\"/opinion/106062/ftc-v-henry-broch-co/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 167-168, </a></span>80 S.Ct. at 1159-1160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading of the Dealers' allegations, viewed in the light most favorable to them, does not support a claim that Ford's increase in its vehicle prices was a price differential of the type prohibited by the Robinson-Patman Act.  Any differences in vehicle prices resulting from the higher warranty reimbursement levels would fall squarely within the safe harbor allowed by the Act, and therefore be lawful.  Because the Dealers have not alleged facts sufficient to sustain their Robinson-Patman claims, we cannot agree that these \"issues\" remain open for trial.  We therefore find that the district court properly dismissed the Dealers' Robinson-Patman claims, and we affirm this dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Claims under 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1174(1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dealers contend that the district court erroneously dismissed their claims that Ford had engaged in unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive practices, in violation of 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1174(1).  They argue that those claims should be tried on their merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dealers' Sec. 1174(1) claims, however, rest upon their allegations that Ford's warranty surcharge was illegal.  As we held above, the surcharge did not violate Sec. 1176.  Thus, in light of the fact that Ford committed no unlawful acts in instituting its warranty surcharge, the Dealers' Sec. 1174(1) claims necessarily collapse.  We therefore hold that these claims were properly dismissed, and we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Claims under 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1182</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Dealers assert that the district court erred in dismissing their claims that Ford's warranty surcharge violated public policy within the meaning of 10 M.R.S.A. Sec. 1182.  Section 1182 authorizes courts to grant declaratory and injunctive relief for practices in violation of certain Maine statutes, including Sec. 1176.  Because, as we have explained, we find that Ford did not violate Sec. 1176, the Dealers' claims under Sec. 1182 are moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's opinion is affirmed in part and reversed in part.

Ford points out, however, that while some dealers pay more in a given month under the new policy, others pay less and receive more.  The surcharge, Ford stated during oral argument before this court, was calculated to recoup Ford's increased costs of doing business over time, spreading those costs evenly among the dealers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Ford also raised challenges to the statute on various federal statutory and constitutional grounds.  The district court rejected these challenges, and Ford has not raised them in this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Dealers also argued that, in the alternative, the only lawful way for Ford to recoup its increased costs was to institute a wholesale price increase nationwide.  The district court rejected this suggestion, and the Dealers do not raise it on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> See discussion infra regarding the district court's use of the New York Lemon Law cases</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1232 requires that auto manufacturers affix a label, the so-called \"Monroney sticker,\" on each new automobile, disclosing information such as the suggested retail price, the price for each accessory or optional equipment, and transportation charges</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The dealer invoice, unlike the Monroney sticker, shows the price actually paid to Ford by the dealer</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We do not believe, however, that the Dealers are correct in their contention that the district court found the surcharge \"illegal\" in and of itself.  In offering this interpretation, the Dealers take the court's use of the word \"illegal\" out of the sentence and out of its context.  The district court did not state that the surcharge was per se illegal, but rather that it was illegal \"as it is currently structured\" and allowed a wholesale price increase only on the condition that it be accompanied by a sticker price increase.  Indeed, the court stated that if Ford had instituted an accompanying sticker price increase, the court may have ruled differently</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In fact, if anything, the legislative history belies the Dealers' contention that the statute was amended to \"protect\" dealers.  We think that an objective reading of the legislative history indicates the legislature decided that warranty reimbursement levels would be at retail rates, in order to prevent non-warranty customers from being charged prices much higher than the customary retail rates.  Therefore, if anything, the statute was arguably meant to protect non-warranty consumers from inflated prices charged by dealers who are attempting to maintain their average profit margins in the face of a manufacturer's below-retail reimbursement rates</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Because we find the district court's order erroneous, we need not address Ford's arguments that the order brings Sec. 1176 into conflict with federal law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The Dealers rely on Porter v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span> </a></span>(1987) in support of their contentions.  However, as revealed by our analysis, these cases do not control here.  The central issue in Porter v. Warner Holding Co. was whether the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, establishing national rent controls, limited the power of federal courts to order restitution of excessive rents collected in violation of the Act.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104306\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Porter,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/104306/porter-v-warner-holding-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span>, 66 S.Ct. at 1088.   The improper profits at issue in the Porter case were rents collected in direct violation of a statute specifically establishing price controls.  As we discussed above, Sec. 1176 does not establish price controls, nor mandate that manufacturers solely bear the burden of compliance.  To the contrary, Sec. 1176 merely sets forth warranty reimbursement levels, and leaves unregulated the methods by which affected parties may bear or pass on the costs of compliance</p>\n        <p>The Tull case is also inapposite.  The \"quotation\" offered by the Dealers in their brief was pulled out of the most tangential dictum from that case, during which the Court was merely discussing (and rejecting) the government's analogy between civil penalties under the Clean Water Act and equitable actions of disgorgement.  Moreover, not only is the Dealers' proffered \"quotation\" from that case taken out of context, but manipulated so as to acquire a meaning nothing like the original.  We do not appreciate such fast-and-loose use of case law.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
