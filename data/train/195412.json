On  March  23, 1988,  Allison\n                            \n\nWilliams, plaintiff in the district court and appellant here,\n\nwas  injured when he was  struck by a  \"toolholder\" that came\n\nloose from a vertical milling machine.  At the time, Williams\n\nwas working  in Massachusetts for R&amp;K  Precision Tool Company\n\n(\"R&amp;K\").   The vertical milling  machine, owned  by R&amp;K,  had\n\nbeen   made  in   1978  by   Monarch  Machine   Tool  Company\n\n(\"Monarch\"), the defendant-appellee in this case.\n\n     The   machine  in  question   was  a  computer  assisted\n\nmachining  center that  performs  various functions  such  as\n\nmilling,  boring and  fly  cutting.    At  the  time  of  the\n\naccident, the  machine was being  operated by a  co-worker of\n\nWilliams  who had attached to  the machine a  fly cutter that\n\nhad been  made \"in-house\" by R&amp;K.   The fly cutter  is a disk\n\ninto which  a toolholder and  attached tool can  be inserted.\n\nThe  fly cutter then rotates  on the spindle  of the vertical\n\nmilling machine and the  rotating tool can be used to  cut or\n\nshave a piece of metal.\n\n     In this  instance, the  co-worker who was  operating the\n\nvertical milling machine had been requested by his foreman to\n\nmachine a  piece of  aluminum into a  specific configuration.\n\nAfter  a few  seconds  of  operation,  in which  the  spindle\n\nrotated  at 2500 rpms, the toolholder came loose from the set\n\nscrews  holding it  to  the fly  cutter,  and the  toolholder\n\nstruckWilliamswho wasstanding nearby.He wasseriously injured.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     Williams  brought  suit in  the  district  court against\n\nMonarch.   His complaint,  claiming negligence and  breach of\n\nwarranty, rested on two  notions as to what Monarch  had done\n\nwrong.   First, Williams  contended that Monarch  should have\n\nprovided shielding to contain  ejected projectiles, a  danger\n\nthat  Williams  said  was  known  to  Monarch.   Second,  the\n\ncomplaint  said that Monarch should  have warned users of the\n\nrisk  of such ejections  so that  in-house measures  could be\n\ntaken;  in this connection,  Williams contended  that Monarch\n\nhad an ongoing duty to warn prior purchasers of new shielding\n                                                   \n\nequipment developed after  the machine's manufacture  late in\n\n1978 but before the accident in 1988.\n\n     The trial took place  in January 1993.  At  trial, there\n\nwas expert  evidence on  both sides  on issues  of shielding,\n\nwarning and  causation.   There was also  evidence concerning\n\nproper  use of the vertical  milling machine and the industry\n\nstandards  bearing  on  the  respective  responsibilities  of\n\nmanufacturers  and  users in  providing  guards and  shields.\n\nAnswering  specific interrogatories,  the jury  found against\n\nWilliams, and for  Monarch, on  each of the  claims against  \n\nMonarch.\n\n     Following  the jury  verdict, Williams  moved for  a new\n\ntrial  asserting as grounds the two issues now raised on this\n\nappeal.   One  is  Williams' claim  that  the district  court\n\nwrongly admitted testimony from  a second expert witness, who\n\n                             -3-\n\nwas belatedly produced by Monarch and who testified at trial;\n\nand the other  is that an instruction requested  by Williams,\n\naffirming the manufacturer's ongoing  duty to warn even after\n\na  machine is  sold, should  have been  given.   The district\n\ncourt denied the motion, and Williams appealed.  We affirm.\n\n     The events relating to the second expert can  be briefly\n\nsummarized.    As  is  common  in  cases  where  experts  are\n\nanticipated, interrogatories  under Fed.  R. Civ. P.  26 were\n\nemployed  by  the  parties  to  identify  experts  and  their\n\nexpected testimony.  After successive extensions, Monarch  on\n\nOctober 16, 1991,  identified its expert as David  Lundeen, a\n\nvice president of Monarch, and described the substance of his\n\ntestimony.   Williams'  answers  identified  his own  expert.\n\nThereafter, Lundeen was deposed by Williams.  \n\n     At a  March 26, 1992, pretrial  conference, the district\n\ncourt  set January 4, 1993, as a  firm trial date.  The court\n\nalso ordered the parties to  make certain filings during  the\n\nfour weeks preceding the trial date, including the listing of\n\nthe  names of all witnesses, lay and  expert.  On December 4,\n\n1992,  a  month before  the  scheduled  trial, Monarch  filed\n\n\"further supplemental answers\" in response to Williams' prior\n\n\"expert\" interrogatories identifying for the first time Ralph\n\nBarnett as an additional expert witness.1\n\n                    \n\n     1The   December  4   filing   also  identified   another\npreviously  unnamed expert  for the  defense.   However, this\nthird expert was  never proffered  at trial and  need not  be\n\n                             -4-\n\n     On December 28, 1992, Williams filed  a motion in limine\n                                                             \n\nto exclude  Barnett's testimony on the  ground that Barnett's\n\nlate appearance  would prejudice Williams.   At a  hearing on\n\nJanuary 11, 1993, immediately before the start of trial,  the\n\ndistrict court  heard argument  on the  in limine  motion and\n                                                 \n\noffered to postpone the trial for a week and permit Barnett's\n\ndeposition to  be taken.   When  Williams' counsel said  that\n\nthis would not cure the  prejudice, the court proceeded  with\n\nthe trial  immediately.  Later, the court approved the taking\n\nof Barnett's deposition during  a recess of trial  on January\n\n13, 1993, the  day before Williams' own expert  was scheduled\n\nto testify.\n\n     On  appeal,  Williams  argues that  the  district  court\n\nabused  its  authority  by   refusing  to  exclude  Barnett's\n\ntestimony.   Williams  contends that  Barnett did  not merely\n\nrepeat Lundeen's opinions  but added new theories of his own.\n\nWilliams brushes  aside the proffered  one-week extension  as\n\nwholly inadequate  to allow the counsel to depose Barnett, to\n\ndevelop adequate rebuttal information, and to allow Williams'\n\nown expert the time to adjust his own testimony to answer the\n\nnew theories.  Monarch, in  turn, belittles the importance of\n\nBarnett's  testimony  and argues  that  his  late appearances\n\nviolated no rule or order.\n\n                    \n\ndiscussed further.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     In our  view, the  last-minute appearance of  new expert\n\nwitnesses,  or substantial expansion  of previously disclosed\n\nexpert testimony,  has become a troublesome  feature of civil\n\nlitigation.   Such  last-minute  expert  testimony  is  often\n\nimprovisation rather than ambush,  but it can still undermine\n\ntrial preparations  carefully made by an  adversary over many\n\nmonths  or even years.  For this reason, some district judges\n\nenter  pre-trial  orders setting  explicit deadlines  for the\n\nnaming of experts and then  allow new ones to be named  after\n\nthose deadlines only for good cause shown.  Cf. Local R. 26.4\n                                               \n\n(D. Mass.).\n\n     Rule  26  interrogatories do  not  have  quite the  same\n\neffect.   Formally, the answers reflect  counsel's good-faith\n\nexpectation  as to the experts  to be offered,  and the rules\n\nthemselves   (as   phrased    in   1992)   underscored   this\n\nqualification by imposing a duty \"seasonally to supplement\" a\n\nprior answer identifying an expert or revealing the substance\n\nof expert testimony.  See former Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(B).\n                         \n\nOf  course, it would violate  this duty to  name belatedly an\n\nexpert  who  had  been retained  by  the  naming  party at  a\n\nsubstantially earlier time.  Here, however, Monarch says that\n\nit named Barnett  shortly after determining  to use him,  and\n\nthere is no evidence to the contrary.\n\n     Our  situation falls  somewhat  in between  an  outright\n\nrequirement  that experts be named  no later than a specified\n\n                             -6-\n\ndate  and the ordinary use of Rule 26 interrogatories.  Here,\n\nthe original  scheduling  order from  the  magistrate  judge,\n\nextended  several times,  directed  that \"full  and  complete\n\nanswers\" to  expert interrogatories  be  furnished by  listed\n\ndates and set  still later  dates  for the completion  of all\n\ndiscovery.   It  may  well have  been  the intention  of  the\n\nmagistrate judge that this be read as an outright cut-off for\n\nthe naming of experts  even though the order is not framed in\n\nquite these terms.\n\n     When on the  day of  trial the  parties presented  their\n\npositions  to the  district  court, the  matter was  blurred.\n\nWilliams did  not explain his position  with exactness, while\n\nMonarch argued (untenably) that, even if a prior deadline had\n\nbeen set, it  was relaxed implicitly by  the district court's\n\nroutine  order saying that all witnesses be listed a month or\n\nso before trial.  Without resolving the dispute, the district\n\ncourt said that it would  not bar important expert  testimony\n\nin  a case with  a large ad  damnum when a  continuance would\n                                   \n\nremedy the problem.  However the  magistrate judge's order is\n\nread,  the   district  court  was  free   to  alter  previous\n\ndeadlines.\n\n     Conversely, even if  the magistrate  judge's order  left\n\nopen the ordinary supplementation option, this court has held\n\nthat trial  judges have inherent  discretionary authority  to\n\nexclude  expert evidence  where Rule 26  interrogatories have\n\n                             -7-\n\nbeen   employed  and   where   the  court   finds  that   the\n\nsupplementation was not  seasonable.  This is so  even though\n\nthe late-named expert was disclosed as  soon as he or she had\n\nbeen retained.  Fusco  v. General Motors Corp., 11  F.3d 259,\n                                             \n\n265-66 (1st Cir. 1993);  Thibeault v. Square D Co.,  960 F.2d\n                                                 \n\n239, 245 (1st Cir. 1992).  If the district court in this case\n\nhad   decided  to   preclude  Barnett's   testimony  as   not\n\n\"seasonably\"  disclosed,  such a  decision would  likely have\n\nbeen sustained.\n\n     But  the  broad discretion  of  trial  judges to  manage\n\nscheduling, discovery and sanctions  cuts both ways.  Through\n\nno one's fault, evidence is sometimes obtained belatedly when\n\na  gap in  proof is perceived  or a new  source is uncovered.\n\nDiscovery  aims only  to mitigate  surprise, for  nothing can\n\neliminate  it  entirely from  trial practice.   Interrogatory\n\nanswers are supplemented in widely varying  circumstances, so\n\nthat great deference  must be  afforded to the  judge on  the\n\nspot  in devising the proper remedy.  See, e.g., Nickerson v.\n                                                          \n\nG.D. Searle &amp; Co., 900 F.2d 412 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                \n\n     Here, the trial  court did  offer a week's  delay and  a\n\ngood deal can be done in  a week.  We appreciate that counsel\n\nwho accepts a half measure under protest may preserve     the\n\nclaim of error but greatly  reduces the likelihood of success\n\nin any later appeal.  Yet, settling a case prepared for trial\n\nrequires  compromises, and  it is  generally right  to insist\n\n                             -8-\n\nthat counsel take the best deal offered under protest, do the\n\nbest job possible  and then  (if the verdict  goes the  other\n\nway) argue to the appeals court that what was allowed was not\n\nenough.  At  least then there  is a concrete  record to  show\n\nwhat could be done in the time allowed.2\n\n     We  do not  suggest  that Williams  waived his  right to\n\nappeal  by  rejecting the  district  court's  proposals.   If\n\nWilliams' trial  counsel  thought that  a week  was close  to\n\nuseless  and had  other  reasons to  move  swiftly to  trial,\n\nnothing  prevents Williams  from arguing  now on  appeal that\n\npreclusion of the testimony  was the only permissible remedy.\n                                         \n\nBut  by   rejecting  the  proffered   half-measure,  Williams\n\ninclines a  reviewing court to resolve  any legitimate doubts\n\nabout whether a  week might have been enough in  favor of the\n\ndistrict judge's view that it would have been sufficient.\n\n     In this case we  have reviewed the interrogatory answers\n\nas originally  directed to Lundeen's  proposed testimony  and\n\ncompared  them  to testimony  actually  given  by Barnett  at\n\ntrial.  There is  no value in repeating  details here; it  is\n\nenough to say  that Williams  is right in  urging that  there\n\n                    \n\n     2In fact, the district court initially offered  Williams\na continuance without limiting  the offer to a week  and only\nspecified the one-week  delay when Williams  did not state  a\nfigure of his own, assertedly fearing a long delay in getting\nthe  plaintiff's case to trial.   There is  little to suggest\nthat the district court would not  have entertained a request\nfor  a longer  continuance,  especially if  based  on a  more\nsubstantial  effort by counsel to do the best he could during\nthe original week.\n\n                             -9-\n\nwere substantial differences--not  so much contradictions  as\n\nnew  theories--that  required  new  lines  of questioning  by\n\nWilliams' counsel and new rebuttal from Williams' own expert.\n\nWhat  we cannot  say is  that the  district court  abused its\n\ndiscretion in thinking that an extra week was enough to allow\n                                         \n\nWilliams to adjust his position.\n\n     Williams points to  the many demands  on counsel in  the\n\nweeks before a scheduled  trial, but what was offered  was an\n\nextra week to be derived by postponing the trial.  Almost all\n     \n\nof  this  time  was  presumably  available for  the  task  of\n\ndeposing  Barnett,  gathering  material  about  him  and  his\n\ntestimony  and  preparing Williams'  own  expert  on any  new\n\nsubject  matter.   Indeed,  had  Williams'  counsel made  the\n\neffort, he  would have been better  placed at the end  of the\n\nweek to  argue that still more time  was required.  Under all\n\nthe circumstances,  we do  not find  that the district  court\n\nabused  its  discretion  in  refusing  to  exclude  Barnett's\n\ntestimony.\n\n     Williams' brief twice suggests  that the district  court\n\nwithdrew  its original  offer of  a week's  extension because\n\nWilliams refused to accept it  as adequate to avoid prejudice\n\nfrom the late disclosure.   Without generalizing too broadly,\n\nwe  agree that  it would  be a  matter of  some concern  if a\n\ndistrict  court refused  to  provide a  limited  postponement\n\nunless the party offered  it waived the party's claim  that a\n\n                             -10-\n\nlonger extension was required.  In this instance, however, we\n\ndo not read the record to establish such retaliation.\n\n     We  think that  the district  judge may  reasonably have\n\ngained the  impression (based on the  colloquy with Williams'\n\ncounsel)  that  Williams was  not  in  fact interested  in  a\n\ncontinuance in  order  to  cure  the surprise,  but  only  in\n\npreserving  for  appeal  the  position that  the  failure  to\n\nexclude Barnett's testimony was error.   In all events,  when\n\nthe district court finally announced its intention to proceed\n\nwith  trial  at  once, there  was  no  further response  from\n\nWilliams' counsel.  This would be a different case if at that\n\npoint Williams had said that he did want a week's continuance\n\nand was merely refusing to waive his right to appeal. \n\n     Williams' second  and quite  separate claim of  error is\n\ndirected  at  the  district   court's  refusal  to  give  the\n\nfollowing requested instruction:\n\n          The  need to exercise  reasonable care to\n          prevent injuries to foreseeable  users of\n          a product  included a  duty  at least  to\n          inform  user  (sic)  of  a  product  [of]\n          safety  improvement  of  equipment  which\n          would lessen the risk of injury  that has\n          developed after the sale of  the product,\n          but before the injury occurs.\n\nIn  requesting  this instruction,  which  the district  court\n\ndeclined to give, Williams' trial counsel relied upon doCanto\n                                                             \n\nv. Amtek Inc.,  328 N.E.2d 873 (Mass. 1975),  and H.P. Hood &amp;\n                                                             \n\nSons, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 345 N.E.2d 683 (Mass. 1976).\n                            \n\n                             -11-\n\n     It  is  Williams'  position  that the  vertical  milling\n\nmachine  in question, made in 1978, should have been equipped\n\nwith an optional chip guard of a type that Monarch later came\n\nto use for most of its machines; that by the  late 1980's, 85\n\nto 90  percent of newly  produced Monarch machines  were sold\n\nwith  these enclosures;  and  that Monarch  was aware  of the\n\nunguarded R&amp;K machine and  serviced it from time to  time but\n\ndid not  give R&amp;K warning of the guards after the sale of the\n\nmachine but prior to the accident in 1988.  \n\n     Williams does  not claim that  the instructions actually\n\ngiven were faulty in  defining Monarch's duty at the  time it\n\nmade  and sold  the machine  in question.   Rather,  Williams\n\nargues that  a manufacturer who has discharged  all duties at\n\nthe  time the  product was  produced and  sold will  still be\n\nliable  if it fails unreasonably to  advise a prior purchaser\n\nof  the product  of new,  safety enhancing  improvements made\n\nafter the sale.  We  can find no indication that such  a rule\n\nhas been  adopted in Massachusetts, whose law governs in this\n\ncase.\n\n     In  doCanto,  the  decision  principally  relied  on  in\n                \n\nWilliams'  brief, the  Massachusetts  Supreme Judicial  Court\n\nsustained  the admissibility of evidence showing improvements\n\nmade after the sale  of the product but before  the accident;\n\nbut the  court did  not  adopt the  view  \"that there  was  a\n\ncontinuing duty  to warn  purchasers  of safety  improvements\n\n                             -12-\n\n[later] made to a machine which was reasonably safe at sale.\"\n\n328 N.E.2d at 877.  Rather, the court found that the evidence\n\nwas  pertinent to  issues of  liability at  the time  of sale\n\n(e.g.,  feasibility,  knowledge of  risk).   Id.    The court\n                                               \n\nimplied that the  manufacturer would have been  entitled to a\n\nlimiting instruction on the  permissible use of the evidence.\n\nId.  \n   \n\n     The  doCanto decision goes no further than to say that a\n                 \n\nduty  to warn  of post-sale  safety improvements  \"may\" exist\n\nwhere  the  machine  as  originally sold  was  of  \"negligent\n\ndesign.\"   328 N.E.2d at  877.   This dictum, even  if \"does\"\n\nwere substituted for \"may,\" would do Williams no good because\n\nin this case the jury's  answers showed that it did  not find\n\nthat  the machine  as  originally sold  had been  negligently\n\ndesigned.  Indeed,  in Hayes  v. Ariens Co.,  462 N.E.2d  273\n                                          \n\n(Mass. 1984), the  court said:  \"We  did not say  in doCanto,\n                                                            \n\nand we have  never said, that  a manufacturer  has a duty  to\n\nadvise  purchasers about  post-sale safety  improvements that\n\nhave  been made to a machine that  was reasonably safe at the\n\ntime of sale.\"3\n\n                    \n\n     3The Hood  case, also relied  upon by Williams,  is even\n              \nless helpful to Williams.  Hood did involve in part a federal\n                                                             \nstatute governing  motor vehicle  defects, see 345  N.E.2d at\n                                              \n687, and  the statute does  address post-sale duties,  see 15\n                                                          \nU.S.C.    1402;  but  there is  no  claim that  this  federal\nstatute in any way governs vertical milling machines.\n\n                             -13-\n\n     Some courts have adopted  the view that there  are broad\n\npost-sale  duties to warn, e.g., Kozlowski v. John E. Smith &amp;\n                                                             \n\nSons  Co., 275  N.W.2d 1915  (Wis. 1979),  and there  is some\n         \n\nacademic support for this extension.  E.g., Note, 33 Stan. L.\n                                                             \n\nRev.  1087 (1981).   Yet,  there is  no suggestion  that this\n   \n\nexpanded  duty  is  the  prevailing  view,  still  less  that\n\nMassachusetts  has  adopted any  such  expansion.   \"We  have\n\nwarned,  time and again,  that litigants  who reject  a state\n\nforum   in  order   to  bring   suit  in   federal  diversity\n\njurisdictions cannot expect that  new trails will be blazed.\"\n\nRyan v.  Royal Ins. Co.  of America,  916 F.2d 731,  744 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir. 1990) (citations omitted).\n\n     Finally, if  manufacturers were held in  some situations\n\nto have a duty to search out prior customers and tell them of\n\nnew improvements  of products  reasonably safe when  sold one\n\nwould expect that a duty potentially so far reaching would be\n\nqualified by other considerations and limitations (e.g.,  the\n                                                       \n\nfeasibility  of conveying  warnings to prior  purchasers, the\n\nseverity of the hazard,  an imbalance between the  parties as\n\nto  knowledge).    The  broad  language  of  the  instruction\n\nproffered by  Williams in  the trial  court contains  no such\n\nrestrictions.   In our view, this makes it even more unlikely\n\nthat the  instruction as framed represents  the present state\n\nof Massachusetts law.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -14-\n",

On  March  23, 1988,  Allison\n                            \n\nWilliams, plaintiff in the district court and appellant here,\n\nwas  injured when he was  struck by a  \"toolholder\" that came\n\nloose from a vertical milling machine.  At the time, Williams\n\nwas working  in Massachusetts for R&amp;K  Precision Tool Company\n\n(\"R&amp;K\").   The vertical milling  machine, owned  by R&amp;K,  had\n\nbeen   made  in   1978  by   Monarch  Machine   Tool  Company\n\n(\"Monarch\"), the defendant-appellee in this case.\n\n     The   machine  in  question   was  a  computer  assisted\n\nmachining  center that  performs  various functions  such  as\n\nmilling,  boring and  fly  cutting.    At  the  time  of  the\n\naccident, the  machine was being  operated by a  co-worker of\n\nWilliams  who had attached to  the machine a  fly cutter that\n\nhad been  made \"in-house\" by R&amp;K.   The fly cutter  is a disk\n\ninto which  a toolholder and  attached tool can  be inserted.\n\nThe  fly cutter then rotates  on the spindle  of the vertical\n\nmilling machine and the  rotating tool can be used to  cut or\n\nshave a piece of metal.\n\n     In this  instance, the  co-worker who was  operating the\n\nvertical milling machine had been requested by his foreman to\n\nmachine a  piece of  aluminum into a  specific configuration.\n\nAfter  a few  seconds  of  operation,  in which  the  spindle\n\nrotated  at 2500 rpms, the toolholder came loose from the set\n\nscrews  holding it  to  the fly  cutter,  and the  toolholder\n\nstruckWilliamswho wasstanding nearby.He wasseriously injured.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     Williams  brought  suit in  the  district  court against\n\nMonarch.   His complaint,  claiming negligence and  breach of\n\nwarranty, rested on two  notions as to what Monarch  had done\n\nwrong.   First, Williams  contended that Monarch  should have\n\nprovided shielding to contain  ejected projectiles, a  danger\n\nthat  Williams  said  was  known  to  Monarch.   Second,  the\n\ncomplaint  said that Monarch should  have warned users of the\n\nrisk  of such ejections  so that  in-house measures  could be\n\ntaken;  in this connection,  Williams contended  that Monarch\n\nhad an ongoing duty to warn prior purchasers of new shielding\n                                                   \n\nequipment developed after  the machine's manufacture  late in\n\n1978 but before the accident in 1988.\n\n     The trial took place  in January 1993.  At  trial, there\n\nwas expert  evidence on  both sides  on issues  of shielding,\n\nwarning and  causation.   There was also  evidence concerning\n\nproper  use of the vertical  milling machine and the industry\n\nstandards  bearing  on  the  respective  responsibilities  of\n\nmanufacturers  and  users in  providing  guards and  shields.\n\nAnswering  specific interrogatories,  the jury  found against\n\nWilliams, and for  Monarch, on  each of the  claims against  \n\nMonarch.\n\n     Following  the jury  verdict, Williams  moved for  a new\n\ntrial  asserting as grounds the two issues now raised on this\n\nappeal.   One  is  Williams' claim  that  the district  court\n\nwrongly admitted testimony from  a second expert witness, who\n\n                             -3-\n\nwas belatedly produced by Monarch and who testified at trial;\n\nand the other  is that an instruction requested  by Williams,\n\naffirming the manufacturer's ongoing  duty to warn even after\n\na  machine is  sold, should  have been  given.   The district\n\ncourt denied the motion, and Williams appealed.  We affirm.\n\n     The events relating to the second expert can  be briefly\n\nsummarized.    As  is  common  in  cases  where  experts  are\n\nanticipated, interrogatories  under Fed.  R. Civ. P.  26 were\n\nemployed  by  the  parties  to  identify  experts  and  their\n\nexpected testimony.  After successive extensions, Monarch  on\n\nOctober 16, 1991,  identified its expert as David  Lundeen, a\n\nvice president of Monarch, and described the substance of his\n\ntestimony.   Williams'  answers  identified  his own  expert.\n\nThereafter, Lundeen was deposed by Williams.  \n\n     At a  March 26, 1992, pretrial  conference, the district\n\ncourt  set January 4, 1993, as a  firm trial date.  The court\n\nalso ordered the parties to  make certain filings during  the\n\nfour weeks preceding the trial date, including the listing of\n\nthe  names of all witnesses, lay and  expert.  On December 4,\n\n1992,  a  month before  the  scheduled  trial, Monarch  filed\n\n\"further supplemental answers\" in response to Williams' prior\n\n\"expert\" interrogatories identifying for the first time Ralph\n\nBarnett as an additional expert witness.1\n\n                    \n\n     1The   December  4   filing   also  identified   another\npreviously  unnamed expert  for the  defense.   However, this\nthird expert was  never proffered  at trial and  need not  be\n\n                             -4-\n\n     On December 28, 1992, Williams filed  a motion in limine\n                                                             \n\nto exclude  Barnett's testimony on the  ground that Barnett's\n\nlate appearance  would prejudice Williams.   At a  hearing on\n\nJanuary 11, 1993, immediately before the start of trial,  the\n\ndistrict court  heard argument  on the  in limine  motion and\n                                                 \n\noffered to postpone the trial for a week and permit Barnett's\n\ndeposition to  be taken.   When  Williams' counsel said  that\n\nthis would not cure the  prejudice, the court proceeded  with\n\nthe trial  immediately.  Later, the court approved the taking\n\nof Barnett's deposition during  a recess of trial  on January\n\n13, 1993, the  day before Williams' own expert  was scheduled\n\nto testify.\n\n     On  appeal,  Williams  argues that  the  district  court\n\nabused  its  authority  by   refusing  to  exclude  Barnett's\n\ntestimony.   Williams  contends that  Barnett did  not merely\n\nrepeat Lundeen's opinions  but added new theories of his own.\n\nWilliams brushes  aside the proffered  one-week extension  as\n\nwholly inadequate  to allow the counsel to depose Barnett, to\n\ndevelop adequate rebuttal information, and to allow Williams'\n\nown expert the time to adjust his own testimony to answer the\n\nnew theories.  Monarch, in  turn, belittles the importance of\n\nBarnett's  testimony  and argues  that  his  late appearances\n\nviolated no rule or order.\n\n                    \n\ndiscussed further.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     In our  view, the  last-minute appearance of  new expert\n\nwitnesses,  or substantial expansion  of previously disclosed\n\nexpert testimony,  has become a troublesome  feature of civil\n\nlitigation.   Such  last-minute  expert  testimony  is  often\n\nimprovisation rather than ambush,  but it can still undermine\n\ntrial preparations  carefully made by an  adversary over many\n\nmonths  or even years.  For this reason, some district judges\n\nenter  pre-trial  orders setting  explicit deadlines  for the\n\nnaming of experts and then  allow new ones to be named  after\n\nthose deadlines only for good cause shown.  Cf. Local R. 26.4\n                                               \n\n(D. Mass.).\n\n     Rule  26  interrogatories do  not  have  quite the  same\n\neffect.   Formally, the answers reflect  counsel's good-faith\n\nexpectation  as to the experts  to be offered,  and the rules\n\nthemselves   (as   phrased    in   1992)   underscored   this\n\nqualification by imposing a duty \"seasonally to supplement\" a\n\nprior answer identifying an expert or revealing the substance\n\nof expert testimony.  See former Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(B).\n                         \n\nOf  course, it would violate  this duty to  name belatedly an\n\nexpert  who  had  been retained  by  the  naming  party at  a\n\nsubstantially earlier time.  Here, however, Monarch says that\n\nit named Barnett  shortly after determining  to use him,  and\n\nthere is no evidence to the contrary.\n\n     Our  situation falls  somewhat  in between  an  outright\n\nrequirement  that experts be named  no later than a specified\n\n                             -6-\n\ndate  and the ordinary use of Rule 26 interrogatories.  Here,\n\nthe original  scheduling  order from  the  magistrate  judge,\n\nextended  several times,  directed  that \"full  and  complete\n\nanswers\" to  expert interrogatories  be  furnished by  listed\n\ndates and set  still later  dates  for the completion  of all\n\ndiscovery.   It  may  well have  been  the intention  of  the\n\nmagistrate judge that this be read as an outright cut-off for\n\nthe naming of experts  even though the order is not framed in\n\nquite these terms.\n\n     When on the  day of  trial the  parties presented  their\n\npositions  to the  district  court, the  matter was  blurred.\n\nWilliams did  not explain his position  with exactness, while\n\nMonarch argued (untenably) that, even if a prior deadline had\n\nbeen set, it  was relaxed implicitly by  the district court's\n\nroutine  order saying that all witnesses be listed a month or\n\nso before trial.  Without resolving the dispute, the district\n\ncourt said that it would  not bar important expert  testimony\n\nin  a case with  a large ad  damnum when a  continuance would\n                                   \n\nremedy the problem.  However the  magistrate judge's order is\n\nread,  the   district  court  was  free   to  alter  previous\n\ndeadlines.\n\n     Conversely, even if  the magistrate  judge's order  left\n\nopen the ordinary supplementation option, this court has held\n\nthat trial  judges have inherent  discretionary authority  to\n\nexclude  expert evidence  where Rule 26  interrogatories have\n\n                             -7-\n\nbeen   employed  and   where   the  court   finds  that   the\n\nsupplementation was not  seasonable.  This is so  even though\n\nthe late-named expert was disclosed as  soon as he or she had\n\nbeen retained.  Fusco  v.

If the district court in this case\n\nhad   decided  to   preclude  Barnett's   testimony  as   not\n\n\"seasonably\"  disclosed,  such a  decision would  likely have\n\nbeen sustained.\n\n     But  the  broad discretion  of  trial  judges to  manage\n\nscheduling, discovery and sanctions  cuts both ways.  Through\n\nno one's fault, evidence is sometimes obtained belatedly when\n\na  gap in  proof is perceived  or a new  source is uncovered.\n\nDiscovery  aims only  to mitigate  surprise, for  nothing can\n\neliminate  it  entirely from  trial practice.   Interrogatory\n\nanswers are supplemented in widely varying  circumstances, so\n\nthat great deference  must be  afforded to the  judge on  the\n\nspot  in devising the proper remedy.  See, e.g., Nickerson v.\n                                                          \n\nG.D.

We appreciate that counsel\n\nwho accepts a half measure under protest may preserve     the\n\nclaim of error but greatly  reduces the likelihood of success\n\nin any later appeal.  Yet, settling a case prepared for trial\n\nrequires  compromises, and  it is  generally right  to insist\n\n                             -8-\n\nthat counsel take the best deal offered under protest, do the\n\nbest job possible  and then  (if the verdict  goes the  other\n\nway) argue to the appeals court that what was allowed was not\n\nenough.  At  least then there  is a concrete  record to  show\n\nwhat could be done in the time allowed.2\n\n     We  do not  suggest  that Williams  waived his  right to\n\nappeal  by  rejecting the  district  court's  proposals.   If\n\nWilliams' trial  counsel  thought that  a week  was close  to\n\nuseless  and had  other  reasons to  move  swiftly to  trial,\n\nnothing  prevents Williams  from arguing  now on  appeal that\n\npreclusion of the testimony  was the only permissible remedy.\n                                         \n\nBut  by   rejecting  the  proffered   half-measure,  Williams\n\ninclines a  reviewing court to resolve  any legitimate doubts\n\nabout whether a  week might have been enough in  favor of the\n\ndistrict judge's view that it would have been sufficient.\n\n     In this case we  have reviewed the interrogatory answers\n\nas originally  directed to Lundeen's  proposed testimony  and\n\ncompared  them  to testimony  actually  given  by Barnett  at\n\ntrial.  There is  no value in repeating  details here; it  is\n\nenough to say  that Williams  is right in  urging that  there\n\n                    \n\n     2In fact, the district court initially offered  Williams\na continuance without limiting  the offer to a week  and only\nspecified the one-week  delay when Williams  did not state  a\nfigure of his own, assertedly fearing a long delay in getting\nthe  plaintiff's case to trial.   There is  little to suggest\nthat the district court would not  have entertained a request\nfor  a longer  continuance,  especially if  based  on a  more\nsubstantial  effort by counsel to do the best he could during\nthe original week.\n\n                             -9-\n\nwere substantial differences--not  so much contradictions  as\n\nnew  theories--that  required  new  lines  of questioning  by\n\nWilliams' counsel and new rebuttal from Williams' own expert.\n\nWhat  we cannot  say is  that the  district court  abused its\n\ndiscretion in thinking that an extra week was enough to allow\n                                         \n\nWilliams to adjust his position.\n\n     Williams points to  the many demands  on counsel in  the\n\nweeks before a scheduled  trial, but what was offered  was an\n\nextra week to be derived by postponing the trial.  Almost all\n     \n\nof  this  time  was  presumably  available for  the  task  of\n\ndeposing  Barnett,  gathering  material  about  him  and  his\n\ntestimony  and  preparing Williams'  own  expert  on any  new\n\nsubject  matter.   Indeed,  had  Williams'  counsel made  the\n\neffort, he  would have been better  placed at the end  of the\n\nweek to  argue that still more time  was required.  Under all\n\nthe circumstances,  we do  not find  that the district  court\n\nabused  its  discretion  in  refusing  to  exclude  Barnett's\n\ntestimony.\n\n     Williams' brief twice suggests  that the district  court\n\nwithdrew  its original  offer of  a week's  extension because\n\nWilliams refused to accept it  as adequate to avoid prejudice\n\nfrom the late disclosure.   Without generalizing too broadly,\n\nwe  agree that  it would  be a  matter of  some concern  if a\n\ndistrict  court refused  to  provide a  limited  postponement\n\nunless the party offered  it waived the party's claim  that a\n\n                             -10-\n\nlonger extension was required.  In this instance, however, we\n\ndo not read the record to establish such retaliation.\n\n     We  think that  the district  judge may  reasonably have\n\ngained the  impression (based on the  colloquy with Williams'\n\ncounsel)  that  Williams was  not  in  fact interested  in  a\n\ncontinuance in  order  to  cure  the surprise,  but  only  in\n\npreserving  for  appeal  the  position that  the  failure  to\n\nexclude Barnett's testimony was error.   In all events,  when\n\nthe district court finally announced its intention to proceed\n\nwith  trial  at  once, there  was  no  further response  from\n\nWilliams' counsel.  This would be a different case if at that\n\npoint Williams had said that he did want a week's continuance\n\nand was merely refusing to waive his right to appeal. \n\n     Williams' second  and quite  separate claim of  error is\n\ndirected  at  the  district   court's  refusal  to  give  the\n\nfollowing requested instruction:\n\n          The  need to exercise  reasonable care to\n          prevent injuries to foreseeable  users of\n          a product  included a  duty  at least  to\n          inform  user  (sic)  of  a  product  [of]\n          safety  improvement  of  equipment  which\n          would lessen the risk of injury  that has\n          developed after the sale of  the product,\n          but before the injury occurs.\n\nIn  requesting  this instruction,  which  the district  court\n\ndeclined to give, Williams' trial counsel relied upon doCanto\n                                                             \n\nv.

Rather,  Williams\n\nargues that  a manufacturer who has discharged  all duties at\n\nthe  time the  product was  produced and  sold will  still be\n\nliable  if it fails unreasonably to  advise a prior purchaser\n\nof  the product  of new,  safety enhancing  improvements made\n\nafter the sale.
