Stimson, Assistant United  States Attorney, with  whom\n                   \nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n           \n\n                                         \n\n                        June 22, 1994\n                                         \n\n          BOWNES,  Senior  Circuit Judge.    Defendant Robert\n          BOWNES,  Senior  Circuit Judge.\n                                        \n\nO'Connor  and  three others  were  indicted  on eight  counts\n\ncharging  violations of  18  U.S.C.    1343  (fraud by  wire,\n\nradio,  or television) and 18  U.S.C.   2  (Principals).  The\n\nindictment alleged that the defendants and others had devised\n\na  scheme to  defraud  and obtain  money by  false pretenses,\n\nrepresentations,  and promises, and had  made or caused to be\n\nmade wire  transmissions in  interstate commerce in  order to\n\ncarry out the fraud.\n\n          The  three other  defendants  pled guilty  prior to\n\ntrial.  Defendant opted for trial and was found guilty on all\n\neight counts by a jury.  This appeal followed.1\n\n                          THE SCHEME\n                                    \n\n          In  order  to understand  the  issues  on appeal  a\n\ndescription  of the  scheme  to defraud  is  necessary.   The\n\nprogenitors of the  fraud were two real estate brokers, Barry\n\nand Diana Tevrow.   Its  purpose was to  secure financing  so\n\nindividuals  could purchase  residential real  estate without\n\nthe necessity of making  down payments.  To  effectuate this,\n\nthe  Tevrows   engineered   successive  purchase   and   sale\n\ntransactions of  residential properties so as  to inflate the\n\nultimate purchase  prices.  Lenders would then  be induced to\n\nadvance loans for substantially more than the properties were\n\nactually worth.  In order for the scheme to work, the Tevrows\n\n                    \n\n1.  Appellate counsel for defendant was not trial counsel.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nhad to persuade the buyer(s) to give false information on the\n\nloan  application(s) anent  their  income and  assets.   This\n\nrequired that  the Tevrows falsify documents,  such as income\n\ntax  withholding statements  and bank statements,  to support\n\nthe false loan application.\n\n          Defendant became part of  the scheme because he was\n\nan experienced  real  estate  appraiser.   His  role  was  to\n\nappraise  the  subject  property  at  an  amount  that  would\n\nconvince the lender that the property had sufficient value as\n\ncollateral  to  secure  the loan.    Defendant  met with  the\n\nTevrows  and they explained their scheme to him, which was to\n\nbuy  the property in the  first instance through  a straw and\n\nthen  immediately  resell  it  at  an  inflated  price.   The\n\ninflated price was determined by  adding to the initial price\n\nthe  following amounts:  (1) $35,000; (2)  any amount of cash\n\nup to $15,000 that  the final purchaser wanted to  receive at\n\nthe closing; plus (3) 20% of (1) and (2).2 \n\n          Defendant   was  told   that  he  had   to  prepare\n\nappraisals that would \"come in\" at the price determined under\n\nthe  formula.   It was  agreed that  defendant would  be paid\n\n$1,000 for every successful closing  in addition to his usual\n\nfee of $250-300  for the  appraisal.  Defendant  was paid  in\n\n                    \n\n2.  We note  the  obvious,  that  the success  of  the  fraud\ndepended upon the Tevrows'  obtaining buyers who were willing\nto submit false loan applications.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ncash  or  by  money order;  at  times  defendant's \"cut\"  was\n\ndeposited directly into his bank account.\n\n          Defendant's  experience  as  an appraiser  did  not\n\nextend to the North Shore area of Massachusetts.  He overcame\n\nthis  deficiency by using Diana Tevrow, who was not a trained\n\nappraiser,  to  help  him.    She  obtained  a listing  sheet\n\nprepared by  the Multiple  Listing Service for  each property\n\nthat  was  to  be used.    The  listing  sheet described  the\n\nproperty and gave the  seller's offering price.  Tevrow  also\n\nobtained a \"field card\" describing the property from the city\n\nhall in the locality  in which the property was  located. She\n\ntook photos of the outside of  the house and made a sketch of\n\nits interior.  Tevrow had the further assignment of selecting\n\n\"comparable  sales\"  properties.    This   entailed  choosing\n\nrecently sold properties whose sales prices could be  used as\n\nbenchmarks  to help establish the value of the property to be\n\nused in the  fraud scheme.  Tevrow  was told by defendant  to\n\nselect \"comparable  sales properties\" solely on  the basis of\n\nprice and not to  worry about whether the properties  were in\n\nfact comparable in location,  appearance, structure, and size\n\nto  the subject  property.   According  to Tevrow,  defendant\n\nchanged  the  description of  the  subject  property and  the\n\n\"comparable sales\"  properties so that it  appeared that they\n\nwere similar.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          No issue has been  raised as to the  sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence.   There  are only  two issues on  appeal:   the\n\ngiving of a willful blindness instruction and sentencing.  \n\n                      WILLFUL BLINDNESS\n                                       \n\n          Defendant makes three  claims on willful blindness.\n\nHis  first is that the  \"silence of the  record regarding the\n\nCourt's decision to charge willful blindness requires vacatur\n\nand remand.\"  Defendant  is claiming that there is  no record\n\nshowing that the district  court complied with Fed.  R. Crim.\n\nP. 303 by notifying defendant of its proposed action upon the\n\n                    \n\n3.  Rule 30.  Instructions\n    Rule 30.  Instructions\n            At the close of the evidence or at such\n          earlier  time  during  the trial  as  the\n          court reasonably directs,  any party  may\n          file  written  requests  that  the  court\n          instruct the jury on the law as set forth\n          in the requests.  At the same time copies\n          of  such requests  shall be  furnished to\n          all  parties.    The court  shall  inform\n                                                   \n          counsel  of its proposed  action upon the\n                                                   \n          requests  prior to their arguments to the\n                                                   \n          jury.   The court  may instruct  the jury\n               \n          before   or   after  the   arguments  are\n          completed or at both times.  No party may\n          assign as error any portion of the charge\n          or omission therefrom  unless that  party\n          objects thereto before  the jury  retires\n          to   consider    its   verdict,   stating\n          distinctly the matter to which that party\n          objects and the grounds of the objection.\n          Opportunity  shall be  given to  make the\n          objection out of the hearing of the jury,\n          and on  request of any party,  out of the\n          presence of the jury.  \n\n(Emphasis ours.)\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nrequests for instructions,  specifically the  one on  willful\n\nblindness, prior to the parties' arguments to the jury.\n\n          This claim  is decisively rejected  by the  record.\n\nThere was a jury charge conference on March 9, two days prior\n\nto the  submission of the case to  the jury on March  11.  At\n\nthe conference a willful  blindness instruction was discussed\n\nat length by the court and the parties.  The discussion ended\n\nby the court informing the prosecutor that defendant objected\n\nto  the  willful blindness  instruction  as  proposed by  the\n\ncourt.  Then followed this colloquy between the court and the\n\nprosecutor:\n\n             MR. POVICH:   Well,  at this point  in\n          time I am not going  -- I'm not going  to\n          fight  his  objection, but  I  reserve my\n          right depending on how things go.\n\n             THE  COURT:  All right.  . . .    I'll\n          tell you  what I'll do  with it.   If  he\n          puts on a case that causes you to want to\n          request  it, you'll let  me know before I\n          charge  the jury  and  also  give me  the\n          substitute  language, either  reinstating\n          what  I  now have  or  whatever different\n          language you want.\n\n          On the next day, March 10, the court gave counsel a\n\ncopy  of  its proposed  jury  charge.    The proposed  charge\n\ncontained the same willful blindness instruction given to the\n\njury  the next  day.   The docket  notes for  March 11  show:\n\n\"Colloquy re: draft of instructions  on willful blindness.  D\n\nobjects  to giving instruction but not  to the specific form.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nJury brought  in.  Govt  &amp; D present closing.   Court charges\n\nthe jury.\"\n\n          The record  establishes:  that  a willful blindness\n\ninstruction was  discussed at  the jury charge  conference on\n\nMarch 9; that a draft of the court's jury charge containing a\n\nwillful  blindness  instruction   was  given  to  defendant's\n\ncounsel  on March 10; and  that on March  11, defense counsel\n\nobjected,  prior to  final  argument, to  giving the  willful\n\nblindness instruction  but not to  its specific form.   There\n\nwas  no violation by the district court of the requirement of\n\nFed. R. Crim. P.  30 that, \"[t]he court shall  inform counsel\n\nof  its proposed  action  upon the  requests  prior to  their\n\narguments to the jury.\"\n\n          Before    getting   to    defendant's   substantive\n\nobjections  to  the willful  blindness instruction,  we first\n\nconsider the  government's claim that a  proper objection was\n\nnot made,  as required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 30, to the willful\n\nblindness instruction  after the charge was  given and before\n\nthe  jury retired  for deliberations.   At  the close  of his\n\ninstructions  the court asked if there were any objections to\n\nthe charge.  The following colloquy then took place:\n\n             MR.   McMAHON:      Your  Honor,   the\n          defendant is satisfied with the exception\n          of  the willful blindness  charge and his\n          objections have been duly recorded in two\n          of my memorandums.\n\n             THE COURT:   Well, you're required  to\n          make them again now after it's given.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n             MR. McMAHON:  I'm making them now.\n\n             THE   COURT:       All  right.    That\n          objection is overruled.\n\n          Rule 30 explicitly states in pertinent part:\n\n          No party may assign as  error any portion\n          of  the  charge  or   omission  therefrom\n          unless that party objects  thereto before\n          the jury retires to consider its verdict,\n          stating  distinctly  the matter  to which\n          that party objects and the grounds of the\n          objection.\n\nDespite being warned  by the court,  defense counsel did  not\n\nstate the grounds  of the objection.   The case  law in  this\n\ncircuit  requires strict  compliance  with the  words of  the\n\nRule:\n\n          As we have repeatedly held, Fed.R.Crim.P.\n          30 means  what it says.  A  party may not\n          claim error in the judge's charge to  the\n          jury  unless  that party  \"objects\" after\n          the judge gives the charge but before the\n          \"jury retires,\" and,  when objecting  the\n          party must  \"stat[e] . . . distinctly the\n          matter  to which  that party  objects and\n          the grounds of that objection.\"\n\nUnited  States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                           \n\nThat the grounds for the objection were filed in writing with\n\nthe court prior to the time the charge was given, matters not\n\na  whit.  See United States v.  Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 123 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1987).  In a recent civil case, Poulin v. Greer, 18 F.3d\n                                                    \n\n979,  982  (1st  Cir.  1994),  we  discussed  at  length  the\n\nconsequences of failing to  follow the strictures of  Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P.  51, which is identical to  Fed. R. Crim. P.  30.  We\n\npointed  out   that  failure  to  object   after  the  charge\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n\"constitutes  waiver of the objection.\"   Id.   We also noted\n                                             \n\nthat the  rule was binding on both the court and attorney and\n\nthat  a  statement  by  the court  \"'after  the  charge  that\n\nobjections  made prior to it  will be saved  does not absolve\n\nthe  attorney from  following the  strictures of  the rule.'\"\n\nId.(quotingMcGrath v.Spirito,733 F.2d967, 969(1stCir. 1984)).\n                            \n\n          The failure  of defendant to follow  the command of\n\nRule  30 means  that our  review is  limited to  plain error.\n\nPoulin, 18 F.3d at 982; United States v. Latorre, 922 F.2d 1,\n                                                \n\n10 (1st Cir.  1990).   Defendant took the  position at  trial\n\nthat he was \"never told what  was going on with this scheme.\"\n\nHe further  testified that  he believed the  information that\n\nwas provided him about the properties was true.  Such a claim\n\ncries out for a willful  blindness instruction, when there is\n\nevidence to  the contrary, as  there was  in abundance  here.\n\nSee infra at 3-4.\n         \n\n          The trial  court  may instruct  the  jury\n          concerning   willful  blindness   when  a\n          defendant claims a lack of knowledge, the\n          facts support an inference of defendant's\n          conscious course of deliberate ignorance,\n          and  the instruction,  taken as  a whole,\n          cannot be  misunderstood  by a  juror  as\n          mandating the inference of knowledge.\n\nUnited States v. Brandon,  17 F.3d 409, 452 (1st  Cir. 1994);\n                        \n\nUnited States v.  Jones, 10  F.3d 901, 906  (1st Cir.  1993).\n                       \n\nViewed in the perspective of plain error, we find that it was\n\nnot plain error  to give a willful blindness  instruction and\n\nthat the form of the instruction was not plainly erroneous.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n                          SENTENCING\n                                    \n\n          After  a  lengthy  sentencing  hearing   the  court\n\nallowed  a  two-level  decrease  under  U.S.S.G     3B1.2(b),\n\nfinding  that  defendant  was  a  minor  participant  in  the\n\noffense.  This was not recommended in the presentence report.\n\nDefendant's adjusted offense level was 19.  Because he was in\n\nCriminal  History Category  I,  the  applicable  imprisonment\n\nrange was 30 to  37 months with a supervised release range of\n\n24 to 36 months.  The fine range was $6,000 to $60,000.   The\n\nmaximum restitution  figure was $1,266,883.75.   The  special\n\nassessment was $50  for each of the eight counts  for a total\n\nsum of $400.00.\n\n          The sentence given was:  30 months imprisonment; 24\n\nmonths  of   supervised  release;   no  fine   was  assessed;\n\nrestitution  in the  amount  of $40,000  was  ordered, and  a\n\nspecial assessment of $400 was levied.  Defendant claims that\n\nthe sentence was incorrectly calculated for two reasons:  the\n\ncourt  failed  to consider  U.S.S.G.     1B1.3(a)(1); and  it\n\nfailed to allow a downward departure  under U.S.S.G.   2F1.1.\n\nWe find  that defendant's sentencing error  claims are barred\n\nfor procedural reasons.\n\n          We  start  with  the  court's  alleged  failure  to\n\nconsider U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(1).  This guideline provides: \n\n          (B)  in  the  case   of  a   jointly\n               undertaken criminal activity (a\n               criminal      plan,     scheme,\n               endeavor,     or     enterprise\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n               undertaken by  the defendant in\n               concert with others, whether or\n               not  charged as  a conspiracy),\n               all reasonably foreseeable acts\n               and  omissions   of  others  in\n               furtherance   of  the   jointly\n               undertaken criminal activity,\n\n          that  occurred  during the  commission of\n          the offense of conviction, in preparation\n          for  that offense,  or in  the course  of\n          attempting   to    avoid   detection   or\n          responsibility for that offense;\n\nDefendant   argues   that  in   sentencing,  as   opposed  to\n\ndetermining   conviction,   a  co-conspirator   defendant  is\n\nresponsible  only  for  those  acts  which  were   reasonably\n\nforeseeable by him.  This is undoubtedly correct.  See United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Balogun,  989 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.  1993).  And it\n                 \n\nis  clear that the district court did not consider U.S.S.G.  \n\n1B1.3(1)(B) in  sentencing defendant.   But it is  also clear\n\nthat  the court was never asked to consider this guideline at\n\nthe sentencing hearing or prior to it.\n\n          The initial presentence report determined  the loss\n\ndue to  charged conduct  to be  $1,061,264.00.   The  revised\n\npresentence  report, made  in response  to objections  by the\n\ngovernment, included  losses due  to uncharged  conduct which\n\nincreased the loss to $1,266,883.75.   There was no objection\n\nby defendant  to the  original  presentence report.   At  the\n\nsentencing hearing defense counsel was  asked by the court if\n\nhe  had  any  objections  to  the  proposed  revision of  the\n\npresentence  report.  His response was:  \"No, your Honor, not\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nfrom  the defendant.\"    We  have  read  the  record  of  the\n\nsentencing hearing carefully; defense counsel never mentioned\n\nor alluded to U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(1)(B).\n\n          \"We  do  not review  sentencing  guideline disputes\n\nwhich were not preserved before  the district court.\"  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

But Balogun makes  it evident that the defendant\n                        \n\nin that  case  raised the  question of  the applicability  of\n\nU.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(1) in  the district court.  Balogun,  989\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 22.\n\n          Defendant fares no better  on his argument that the\n\ncourt should  have departed  downward under the  authority of\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1, Commentary 10, which provides:\n\n          In  a few instances,  the loss determined\n          under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the\n          seriousness  of the  offense.   This  may\n          occur,  for  example  where  a  defendant\n          attempted to negotiate an instrument that\n          was so  obviously fraudulent that  no one\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n          would seriously consider honoring it.  In\n          such cases,  a downward departure  may be\n          warranted.\n\n          We will  assume that by referring  to United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

We note that after referring to Gregorio,\n                                                            \n\ndefense  counsel  apparently shifted  gears  to  argue for  a\n\ndownward departure under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.  \n\n          The  court  made  it  abundantly  clear during  the\n\nsentencing  hearing that it was  fully aware of  its power to\n\ndepart downward  on the amount of  loss but would not  do so.\n\nIn  fact, the  court  discussed the  applicability of  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

Sec. 1343 (fraud by wire, radio, or television) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2 (Principals).  The indictment alleged that the defendants and others had devised a scheme to defraud and obtain money by false pretenses, representations, and promises, and had made or caused to be made wire transmissions in interstate commerce in order to carry out the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three other defendants pled guilty prior to trial.  Defendant opted for trial and was found guilty on all eight counts by a jury.  This appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to understand the issues on appeal a description of the scheme to defraud is necessary.  The progenitors of the fraud were two real estate brokers, Barry and Diana Tevrow.  Its purpose was to secure financing so individuals could purchase residential real estate without the necessity of making down payments.  To effectuate this, the Tevrows engineered successive purchase and sale transactions of residential properties so as to inflate the ultimate purchase prices.  Lenders would then be induced to advance loans for substantially more than the properties were actually worth.  In order for the scheme to work, the Tevrows had to persuade the buyer(s) to give false information on the loan application(s) anent their income and assets.  This required that the Tevrows falsify documents, such as income tax withholding statements and bank statements, to support the false loan application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant became part of the scheme because he was an experienced real estate appraiser.  His role was to appraise the subject property at an amount that would convince the lender that the property had sufficient value as collateral to secure the loan.  Defendant met with the Tevrows and they explained their scheme to him, which was to buy the property in the first instance through a straw and then immediately resell it at an inflated price.  The inflated price was determined by adding to the initial price the following amounts:  (1) $35,000;  (2) any amount of cash up to $15,000 that the final purchaser wanted to receive at the closing;  plus (3) 20% of (1) and (2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was told that he had to prepare appraisals that would \"come in\" at the price determined under the formula.  It was agreed that defendant would be paid $1,000 for every successful closing in addition to his usual fee of $250-300 for the appraisal.  Defendant was paid in cash or by money order;  at times defendant's \"cut\" was deposited directly into his bank account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's experience as an appraiser did not extend to the North Shore area of Massachusetts.  He overcame this deficiency by using Diana Tevrow, who was not a trained appraiser, to help him.  She obtained a listing sheet prepared by the Multiple Listing Service for each property that was to be used.  The listing sheet described the property and gave the seller's offering price.  Tevrow also obtained a \"field card\" describing the property from the city hall in the locality in which the property was located.  She took photos of the outside of the house and made a sketch of its interior.  Tevrow had the further assignment of selecting \"comparable sales\" properties.  This entailed choosing recently sold properties whose sales prices could be used as benchmarks to help establish the value of the property to be used in the fraud scheme.  Tevrow was told by defendant to select \"comparable sales properties\" solely on the basis of price and not to worry about whether the properties were in fact comparable in location, appearance, structure, and size to the subject property.  According to Tevrow, defendant changed the description of the subject property and the \"comparable sales\" properties so that it appeared that they were similar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No issue has been raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence.  There are only two issues on appeal:  the giving of a willful blindness instruction and sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>WILLFUL BLINDNESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant makes three claims on willful blindness.  His first is that the \"silence of the record regarding the Court's decision to charge willful blindness requires vacatur and remand.\"   Defendant is claiming that there is no record showing that the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 30<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> by notifying defendant of its proposed action upon the requests for instructions, specifically the one on willful blindness, prior to the parties' arguments to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim is decisively rejected by the record.  There was a jury charge conference on March 9, two days prior to the submission of the case to the jury on March 11.  At the conference a willful blindness instruction was discussed at length by the court and the parties.  The discussion ended by the court informing the prosecutor that defendant objected to the willful blindness instruction as proposed by the court.  Then followed this colloquy between the court and the prosecutor:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. POVICH:  Well, at this point in time I am not going--I'm not going to fight his objection, but I reserve my right depending on how things go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  All right....  I'll tell you what I'll do with it.  If he puts on a case that causes you to want to request it, you'll let me know before I charge the jury and also give me the substitute language, either reinstating what I now have or whatever different language you want.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the next day, March 10, the court gave counsel a copy of its proposed jury charge.  The proposed charge contained the same willful blindness instruction given to the jury the next day.  The docket notes for March 11 show:  \"Colloquy re:  draft of instructions on willful blindness.  D objects to giving instruction but not to the specific form.  Jury brought in.  Govt &amp; D present closing.  Court charges the jury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record establishes:  that a willful blindness instruction was discussed at the jury charge conference on March 9;  that a draft of the court's jury charge containing a willful blindness instruction was given to defendant's counsel on March 10;  and that on March 11, defense counsel objected, prior to final argument, to giving the willful blindness instruction but not to its specific form.  There was no violation by the district court of the requirement of Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 that, \"[t]he court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the jury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before getting to defendant's substantive objections to the willful blindness instruction, we first consider the government's claim that a proper objection was not made, as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, to the willful blindness instruction after the charge was given and before the jury retired for deliberations.  At the close of his instructions the court asked if there were any objections to the charge.  The following colloquy then took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. McMAHON:  Your Honor, the defendant is satisfied with the exception of the willful blindness charge and his objections have been duly recorded in two of my memorandums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Well, you're required to make them again now after it's given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

That objection is overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 30 explicitly states in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite being warned by the court, defense counsel did not state the grounds of the objection.  The case law in this circuit requires strict compliance with the words of the Rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>As we have repeatedly held, Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 means what it says.  A party may not claim error in the judge's charge to the jury unless that party \"objects\" after the judge gives the charge but before the \"jury retires,\" and, when objecting the party must \"stat[e] ... distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of that objection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1991).  That the grounds for the objection were filed in writing with the court prior to the time the charge was given, matters not a whit.  See United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 123 (1st Cir.1987).  In a recent civil case, Poulin v. Greer, 18 F.3d 979, 982 (1st Cir.1994), we discussed at length the consequences of failing to follow the strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 51, which is identical to Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.  We pointed out that failure to object after the charge \"constitutes waiver of the objection.\"  Id.  We also noted that the rule was binding on both the court and attorney and that a statement by the court \" 'after the charge that objections made prior to it will be saved does not absolve the attorney from following the strictures of the rule.' \"  Id. (quoting McGrath v. Spirito, 733 F.2d 967, 969 (1st Cir.1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The failure of defendant to follow the command of Rule 30 means that our review is limited to plain error.  Poulin, 18 F.3d at 982;  United States v. Latorre, 922 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir.1990).  Defendant took the position at trial that he was \"never told what was going on with this scheme.\"   He further testified that he believed the information that was provided him about the properties was true.  Such a claim cries out for a willful blindness instruction, when there is evidence to the contrary, as there was in abundance here.  See supra at 219-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>The trial court may instruct the jury concerning willful blindness when a defendant claims a lack of knowledge, the facts support an inference of defendant's conscious course of deliberate ignorance, and the instruction, taken as a whole, cannot be misunderstood by a juror as mandating the inference of knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

Viewed in the perspective of plain error, we find that it was not plain error to give a willful blindness instruction and that the form of the instruction was not plainly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a lengthy sentencing hearing the court allowed a two-level decrease under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2(b), finding that defendant was a minor participant in the offense.  This was not recommended in the presentence report.  Defendant's adjusted offense level was 19.  Because he was in Criminal History Category I, the applicable imprisonment range was 30 to 37 months with a supervised release range of 24 to 36 months.  The fine range was $6,000 to $60,000.  The maximum restitution figure was $1,266,883.75.  The special assessment was $50 for each of the eight counts for a total sum of $400.00.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence given was:  30 months imprisonment;  24 months of supervised release;  no fine was assessed;  restitution in the amount of $40,000 was ordered, and a special assessment of $400 was levied.  Defendant claims that the sentence was incorrectly calculated for two reasons:  the court failed to consider U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1);  and it failed to allow a downward departure under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1.  We find that defendant's sentencing error claims are barred for procedural reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the court's alleged failure to consider U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1).  This guideline provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that in sentencing, as opposed to determining conviction, a co-conspirator defendant is responsible only for those acts which were reasonably foreseeable by him.  This is undoubtedly correct.  See United States v. Balogun, 989 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1993).  And it is clear that the district court did not consider U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) in sentencing defendant.  But it is also clear that the court was never asked to consider this guideline at the sentencing hearing or prior to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial presentence report determined the loss due to charged conduct to be $1,061,264.00.  The revised presentence report, made in response to objections by the government, included losses due to uncharged conduct which increased the loss to $1,266,883.75.  There was no objection by defendant to the original presentence report.  At the sentencing hearing defense counsel was asked by the court if he had any objections to the proposed revision of the presentence report.  His response was:  \"No, your Honor, not from the defendant.\"   We have read the record of the sentencing hearing carefully;  defense counsel never mentioned or alluded to U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We do not review sentencing guideline disputes which were not preserved before the district court.\"  United States v. Shattuck, 961 F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir.1992).  \"Time and again we have held that facts stated in presentence reports are deemed admitted if they are not challenged in the district court.\"  United States v. Bregnard, 951 F.2d 457, 460 (1st Cir.1991);  see also United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, therefore, no appealable grounds for us to consider the application of U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1).  Defendant relies on Balogun for his contention that the sentence be remanded for the district court to consider the guideline.  But Balogun makes it evident that the defendant in that case raised the question of the applicability of U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1) in the district court.  Balogun, 989 F.2d at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant fares no better on his argument that the court should have departed downward under the authority of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, Commentary 10, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>In a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the seriousness of the offense.  This may occur, for example where a defendant attempted to negotiate an instrument that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it.  In such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume that by referring to United States v. Gregorio, 956 F.2d 341 (1st Cir.1992), which refers to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1 at pages 344-45, defendant preserved this issue for appeal.  We note that after referring to Gregorio, defense counsel apparently shifted gears to argue for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court made it abundantly clear during the sentencing hearing that it was fully aware of its power to depart downward on the amount of loss but would not do so.  In fact, the court discussed the applicability of United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942 (1st Cir.1993), which discusses at length the power of the district court to impose a sentence that departs from the sentencing guidelines.  Under such a scenario we have no jurisdiction to consider the court's refusal to depart downward (or upward).  United States v. LeBlanc, 24 F.3d 340, 348 (1st Cir.1994) (as a general rule decision not to depart is not appealable);  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir.1994) (no appeal from district court's discretionary decision not to depart from guidelines);  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1202 (1st Cir.1993) (a sentencing judge's informed decision not to depart is a non-appealable event).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment below is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellate counsel for defendant was not trial counsel</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note the obvious, that the success of the fraud depended upon the Tevrows' obtaining buyers who were willing to submit false loan applications</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Rule 30.

Sec. 1343 (fraud by wire, radio, or television) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2 (Principals).  The indictment alleged that the defendants and others had devised a scheme to defraud and obtain money by false pretenses, representations, and promises, and had made or caused to be made wire transmissions in interstate commerce in order to carry out the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three other defendants pled guilty prior to trial.  Defendant opted for trial and was found guilty on all eight counts by a jury.  This appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to understand the issues on appeal a description of the scheme to defraud is necessary.  The progenitors of the fraud were two real estate brokers, Barry and Diana Tevrow.  Its purpose was to secure financing so individuals could purchase residential real estate without the necessity of making down payments.  To effectuate this, the Tevrows engineered successive purchase and sale transactions of residential properties so as to inflate the ultimate purchase prices.  Lenders would then be induced to advance loans for substantially more than the properties were actually worth.  In order for the scheme to work, the Tevrows had to persuade the buyer(s) to give false information on the loan application(s) anent their income and assets.  This required that the Tevrows falsify documents, such as income tax withholding statements and bank statements, to support the false loan application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant became part of the scheme because he was an experienced real estate appraiser.  His role was to appraise the subject property at an amount that would convince the lender that the property had sufficient value as collateral to secure the loan.  Defendant met with the Tevrows and they explained their scheme to him, which was to buy the property in the first instance through a straw and then immediately resell it at an inflated price.  The inflated price was determined by adding to the initial price the following amounts:  (1) $35,000;  (2) any amount of cash up to $15,000 that the final purchaser wanted to receive at the closing;  plus (3) 20% of (1) and (2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was told that he had to prepare appraisals that would \"come in\" at the price determined under the formula.  It was agreed that defendant would be paid $1,000 for every successful closing in addition to his usual fee of $250-300 for the appraisal.  Defendant was paid in cash or by money order;  at times defendant's \"cut\" was deposited directly into his bank account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's experience as an appraiser did not extend to the North Shore area of Massachusetts.  He overcame this deficiency by using Diana Tevrow, who was not a trained appraiser, to help him.  She obtained a listing sheet prepared by the Multiple Listing Service for each property that was to be used.  The listing sheet described the property and gave the seller's offering price.  Tevrow also obtained a \"field card\" describing the property from the city hall in the locality in which the property was located.  She took photos of the outside of the house and made a sketch of its interior.  Tevrow had the further assignment of selecting \"comparable sales\" properties.  This entailed choosing recently sold properties whose sales prices could be used as benchmarks to help establish the value of the property to be used in the fraud scheme.  Tevrow was told by defendant to select \"comparable sales properties\" solely on the basis of price and not to worry about whether the properties were in fact comparable in location, appearance, structure, and size to the subject property.  According to Tevrow, defendant changed the description of the subject property and the \"comparable sales\" properties so that it appeared that they were similar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No issue has been raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence.  There are only two issues on appeal:  the giving of a willful blindness instruction and sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>WILLFUL BLINDNESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant makes three claims on willful blindness.  His first is that the \"silence of the record regarding the Court's decision to charge willful blindness requires vacatur and remand.\"   Defendant is claiming that there is no record showing that the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 30<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> by notifying defendant of its proposed action upon the requests for instructions, specifically the one on willful blindness, prior to the parties' arguments to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim is decisively rejected by the record.  There was a jury charge conference on March 9, two days prior to the submission of the case to the jury on March 11.  At the conference a willful blindness instruction was discussed at length by the court and the parties.  The discussion ended by the court informing the prosecutor that defendant objected to the willful blindness instruction as proposed by the court.  Then followed this colloquy between the court and the prosecutor:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. POVICH:  Well, at this point in time I am not going--I'm not going to fight his objection, but I reserve my right depending on how things go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  All right....  I'll tell you what I'll do with it.  If he puts on a case that causes you to want to request it, you'll let me know before I charge the jury and also give me the substitute language, either reinstating what I now have or whatever different language you want.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the next day, March 10, the court gave counsel a copy of its proposed jury charge.  The proposed charge contained the same willful blindness instruction given to the jury the next day.  The docket notes for March 11 show:  \"Colloquy re:  draft of instructions on willful blindness.  D objects to giving instruction but not to the specific form.  Jury brought in.  Govt &amp; D present closing.  Court charges the jury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record establishes:  that a willful blindness instruction was discussed at the jury charge conference on March 9;  that a draft of the court's jury charge containing a willful blindness instruction was given to defendant's counsel on March 10;  and that on March 11, defense counsel objected, prior to final argument, to giving the willful blindness instruction but not to its specific form.  There was no violation by the district court of the requirement of Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 that, \"[t]he court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the jury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before getting to defendant's substantive objections to the willful blindness instruction, we first consider the government's claim that a proper objection was not made, as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, to the willful blindness instruction after the charge was given and before the jury retired for deliberations.  At the close of his instructions the court asked if there were any objections to the charge.  The following colloquy then took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. McMAHON:  Your Honor, the defendant is satisfied with the exception of the willful blindness charge and his objections have been duly recorded in two of my memorandums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Well, you're required to make them again now after it's given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

That objection is overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 30 explicitly states in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite being warned by the court, defense counsel did not state the grounds of the objection.  The case law in this circuit requires strict compliance with the words of the Rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>As we have repeatedly held, Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 means what it says.  A party may not claim error in the judge's charge to the jury unless that party \"objects\" after the judge gives the charge but before the \"jury retires,\" and, when objecting the party must \"stat[e] ... distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of that objection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

Defendant took the position at trial that he was \"never told what was going on with this scheme.\"   He further testified that he believed the information that was provided him about the properties was true.

Sec. 3B1.2(b), finding that defendant was a minor participant in the offense.  This was not recommended in the presentence report.  Defendant's adjusted offense level was 19.  Because he was in Criminal History Category I, the applicable imprisonment range was 30 to 37 months with a supervised release range of 24 to 36 months.  The fine range was $6,000 to $60,000.  The maximum restitution figure was $1,266,883.75.  The special assessment was $50 for each of the eight counts for a total sum of $400.00.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence given was:  30 months imprisonment;  24 months of supervised release;  no fine was assessed;  restitution in the amount of $40,000 was ordered, and a special assessment of $400 was levied.  Defendant claims that the sentence was incorrectly calculated for two reasons:  the court failed to consider U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1);  and it failed to allow a downward departure under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1.  We find that defendant's sentencing error claims are barred for procedural reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the court's alleged failure to consider U.S.S.G.

This guideline provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that in sentencing, as opposed to determining conviction, a co-conspirator defendant is responsible only for those acts which were reasonably foreseeable by him.  This is undoubtedly correct.  See United States v. Balogun, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602831\"><a href=\"/opinion/602831/united-states-v-henry-olawale-balogun-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1993).  And it is clear that the district court did not consider U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) in sentencing defendant.  But it is also clear that the court was never asked to consider this guideline at the sentencing hearing or prior to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial presentence report determined the loss due to charged conduct to be $1,061,264.00.  The revised presentence report, made in response to objections by the government, included losses due to uncharged conduct which increased the loss to $1,266,883.75.  There was no objection by defendant to the original presentence report.  At the sentencing hearing defense counsel was asked by the court if he had any objections to the proposed revision of the presentence report.  His response was:  \"No, your Honor, not from the defendant.\"   We have read the record of the sentencing hearing carefully;  defense counsel never mentioned or alluded to U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We do not review sentencing guideline disputes which were not preserved before the district court.\"  United States v. Shattuck, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581517\"><a href=\"/opinion/581517/united-states-v-lewis-donald-shattuck/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span>, 1015 (1st Cir.1992).  \"Time and again we have held that facts stated in presentence reports are deemed admitted if they are not challenged in the district court.\"  United States v. Bregnard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573880\"><a href=\"/opinion/573880/united-states-v-dale-m-bregnard/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 460 (1st Cir.1991);  see also United States v. Dietz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, therefore, no appealable grounds for us to consider the application of U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1).  Defendant relies on Balogun for his contention that the sentence be remanded for the district court to consider the guideline.  But Balogun makes it evident that the defendant in that case raised the question of the applicability of U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1) in the district court.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602831\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Balogun,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/602831/united-states-v-henry-olawale-balogun-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant fares no better on his argument that the court should have departed downward under the authority of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, Commentary 10, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>In a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the seriousness of the offense.  This may occur, for example where a defendant attempted to negotiate an instrument that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it.  In such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume that by referring to United States v. Gregorio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577673\"><a href=\"/opinion/577673/united-states-v-william-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1992), which refers to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1 at pages 344-45, defendant preserved this issue for appeal.  We note that after referring to Gregorio, defense counsel apparently shifted gears to argue for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K2.0.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court made it abundantly clear during the sentencing hearing that it was fully aware of its power to depart downward on the amount of loss but would not do so.  In fact, the court discussed the applicability of United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1993), which discusses at length the power of the district court to impose a sentence that departs from the sentencing guidelines.  Under such a scenario we have no jurisdiction to consider the court's refusal to depart downward (or upward).  United States v. LeBlanc, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670485\"><a href=\"/opinion/670485/united-states-v-telex-leblanc-united-states-of-america-v-telex-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, 348 (1st Cir.1994) (as a general rule decision not to depart is not appealable);  United States v.

Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1202 (1st Cir.1993) (a sentencing judge's informed decision not to depart is a non-appealable event).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment below is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellate counsel for defendant was not trial counsel</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note the obvious, that the success of the fraud depended upon the Tevrows' obtaining buyers who were willing to submit false loan applications</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Rule 30.

The court may instruct the jury before or after the arguments are completed or at both times.  No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of the objection.  Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury, and on request of any party, out of the presence of the jury.</p>\n        <p>(Emphasis ours.)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
