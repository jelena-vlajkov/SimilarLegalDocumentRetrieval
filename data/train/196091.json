This is  an appeal  from a\r                                             \r\n\njudgment, following a bench trial, for plaintiff vessel operator,\r\n\nPuerto Rico  Marine Management (PRMMI),  in its  suit to  collect\r\n\nfreight charges for a deficit of cargo placed under a Time Volume\r\n\nAgreement (TVA) by defendants  (collectively, Masso).1  Under the\r\n\nTVA,  covering the  period from  May 1990  to August  1992, Masso\r\n\nagreed  to  ship  a  minimum  of  500  \"trailers\"  annually  from\r\n\ncontinental  United States to Puerto Rico.  The complaint alleged\r\n\nthat  during this  period  only 410  shipments  were booked;  the\r\n\ndeficit was 590.  Applying the appropriate tariff of \"$250.00 per\r\n\ncontainer/trailer,\" the total claimed deficit was $147,500.\r\n\n     Masso's  response  to  the  complaint  was  the  affirmative\r\n\ndefense that PRMMI  breached the  TVA.  In  the pre-trial  order,\r\n\nsubmitted  to  the  court  by both  parties,  Masso  outlined its\r\n\ndefense: the TVA (through  its use of ther judges  are tempted to\r\n\nresort  to  \"preachy\"  opinions, issuing  admonitions  about  the\r\n\nfuture which they and their courts are unlikely to follow up with\r\n\nvigor.   An example is  the unhappiness of  appellate courts with\r\n\nsome of the  closing arguments  to the jury  made by  overzealous\r\n\nprosecutors.  In an  otherwise error-free case it is  tempting to\r\n\nshake  a judicial  finger and  say, \"We  shall not in  the future\r\n\npermit  such conduct.\"    But the  next  case comes  along,  with\r\n\noverwhelming evidence  of guilt and in the main a fair trial.  An\r\n\nappellate  court will be reluctant to reverse and  will therefore\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1   Empresas  Masso, Inc.,  Bloques Masso,  Inc., Ferreteria\r\nMasso, Inc., Caguas Lumber Yard, Inc., Masso Enterprises, Inc.\r\r\n\nlook to see  if objection was made to  the offending argument, if\r\n\nthe judge made an  immediate curative instruction, and if  in the\r\n\ncontext  of the entire  case the remarks were  likely to have had\r\n\nany effect.  One learns from long and frustrating experience that\r\n\none reversal is worth a hundred lectures.\r\n\n     In such  matters as  these, affecting  the  manner in  which\r\n\ncases  are tried and the rules and standards governing judges and\r\n\ncounsel,  an appellate court  may on occasion  rest its decision,\r\n\nnot  on a constitution, statue  or regulation, or  even upon case\r\n\nprecedents,  but  upon its  own  supervisory  authority over  the\r\n\nagencies and courts within its jurisdiction.  It is a power to be\r\n\nused  sparingly, but does allow  fine tuning not  confined to the\r\n\nprecise issues  raised by a particular  case.  When a  panel of a\r\n\nfederal court decides to take  this route, it usually  circulates\r\n\nits proposed  rule to all  members of the  court for comment  and\r\n\nagreement. It is understandable that an  attorney in an appellate\r\n\ncourt is  so immersed in  her case  that her  attention has  been\r\n\nrivetted on winning  a victory.  \"Victory\"  is usually translated\r\n\ninto the simple  alternatives: affirmance or  reversal.  But  the\r\n\ncourt itself must confront a  number of collateral choices having\r\n\nto do with the kind, form, finality, secondary  consequences, and\r\n\ntiming  of  decision.   Some  of these  choices will  be  seen as\r\n\nimmensely  important to the  litigants and  their counsel.   Some\r\n\nchiefly concern the internal  workings of the court.  But all are\r\n\nworth some thought on the part of counsel . . . in order to be of\r\n\nhelp both to themselves and the court.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n     2.   Unfinished business.    Before a  conference ends,  the\r                                       \r\n\ncourt must  reflect on whether decision is the next step.  It may\r\n\nbe that, before a novel approach is taken, supplemental memoranda\r\n\nshould  be requested.  Or  perhaps at oral  argument they already\r\n\nhave  been.  Or it  may be that, at  oral argument, the court has\r\n\nsuggested that the parties attempt to settle the case,  or that a\r\n\ncompromise resolution be  explored.  And  sometimes, when a  case\r\n\ninvolving the same issue is pending before the Supreme Court, the\r\n\ncourt  will simply  defer its  decision until  The Supreme  Court\r\n\nacts.   \r\n\n     3.   Disposition  choices.   The  two  options for  a  final\r                                        \r\n\ndecision are, of course, to affirm or reverse.  An added subtlety\r\n\nis a decision whether  or not to have  the mandate (the  document\r\n\nthat  evidences the fact that  it the decision  is now effective)\r\n\nissue  immediately or  to  allow some  time  for a  petition  for\r\n\ncertiorari (i.e., a request that the case be accepted for review)\r                    \r\n\nto be presented to the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\n     Decisions that are somewhat less  than final are those which\r\n\nremand  the case to the trial court.   There are many variants: a\r\n\nremand  with  instructions  only  to  \"institute  proceedings  in\r\n\naccordance  with   this  opinion;\"     a  remand   with  specific\r\n\ninstructions   (e.g.,  in a  successful habeas  corpus  appeal, a\r\n\nremand to the federal district  court with instructions to  grant\r\n\nthe  prisoner's freedom  unless the  state initiates a  new trial\r\n\nwithin ninety days);  a remand for  clarification of the  court's\r\n\nreasoning,  or  for essential  fact  finding;  a  remand with  or\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nwithout a requirement to open the record for additional evidence;\r\n\nand  a  remand  to   a  different  judge.    Each  one  of  these\r\n\npossibilities could be fraught  with significance for a litigant;\r\n\nan  advocate would  do well  to anticipate  these choices  and be\r\n\nprepared to give advice to the court.\r\n\n     Then  there  are critical  choices as  to  timing.   A basic\r\n\nquestion is  whether a new rule  or an extension  of existing law\r\n\nshould be applicable prospectively or retrospectively.  But there\r\n\nare  timing questions  relating to  the issuance  of the  instant\r\n\ndecision.   Sometimes the  panel (if  it is  a  federal court  of\r\n\nappeals)  knows that  one of  the issues  is being  considered by\r\n\nanother panel in another  case; some checking with that  panel is\r\n\nindicated.    The resry,  and conceded  that  a number  of lumber\r\n\nshipments had  been  made for  Masso on  lo/lo vessels.   He  did\r\n\ntestify that  \"for a period of  time\" in the latter  part of 1990\r\n\nthere was no  ro/ro vessel  servicing Jacksonville,  and he  also\r\n\nstated  that at sales meetings, in trying to anticipate revenues,\r\n\nhe would review contracts, including Masso's TVA.  Unable to give\r\n\nmore specific  testimony because of the sanctions  imposed by the\r\n\ncourt,  he gave his conclusory opinion that PRMMI did not provide\r\n\nMASSO with enough ro/ro service to comply with the TVA.\r\n\n     This evidence, even viewed most charitably for defendants on\r\n\nthe  assumption that only  ro/ro's were contemplated  by the TVA,\r\n\nmight support a finding  that to some extent  at some time  PRMMI\r\n\ndid not  live up  to  its undertaking.   But  it  is clear  that,\r\n\ncontrary to  defendants' initial contention, PRMMI  did not phase\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nout its ro/ro fleet during the contract period.  Two of the three\r\n\nro/ro  vessels remained in service for the  duration.  It is also\r\n\nclear  that, except for one  period of time  of uncertain length,\r\n\nthere  was no  failure  to provide  ro/ro  service to  any  port.\r\n\nGenerally, the  temporary unavailability of a  vessel resulted in\r\n\nbiweekly rather than weekly service for a post.\r\n\n     What is left completely  unclear is any basis  for assessing\r\n\nthe magnitude of  any breach on PRMMI's part, to  determine if it\r\n\nwas  sufficient to justify Masso's failure to book more than half\r\n\nof its promised shipments during the two-year period.  The record\r\n\nis  bereft of data as  to dates, ports,  cargoes, and substituted\r\n\narrangements relating  to shipments frustrated because  of a lack\r\n\nof  proper equipment.  Moreover,  the record contains no evidence\r\n\nof  expressed   unhappiness,  oral   or  written,  over   PRMMI's\r\n\nperformance;    acquiescence    and   waiver    remain   distinct\r\n\npossibilities.  On all  of this, we remind  ourselves, defendants\r\n\nbore  the  burden of  both going  forward  with evidence  and the\r\n\nultimate burden of persuasion.\r\n\n     On the record, therefore, we must  rule, as a matter of law,\r\n\nthat  defendants  simply  failed  to  support  their  affirmative\r\n\ndefense.\r\n\n     AFFIRMED.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n",

In the pre-trial order, submitted to the court by both parties, Masso outlined its defense:  the TVA (through its use of the judges are tempted to resort to \"preachy\" opinions, issuing admonitions about the future which they and their courts are unlikely to follow up with vigor.  An example is the unhappiness of appellate courts with some of the closing arguments to the jury made by overzealous prosecutors.  In an otherwise error-free case it is tempting to shake a judicial finger and say, \"We shall not in the future permit such conduct.\"  But the next case comes along, with overwhelming evidence of guilt and in the main a fair trial.  An appellate court will be reluctant to reverse and will therefore look to see if objection was made to the offending argument, if the judge made an immediate curative instruction, and if in the context of the entire case the remarks were likely to have had any effect.  One learns from long and frustrating experience that one reversal is worth a hundred lectures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In such matters as these, affecting the manner in which cases are tried and the rules and standards governing judges and counsel, an appellate court may on occasion rest its decision, not on a constitution, statue or regulation, or even upon case precedents, but upon its own supervisory authority over the agencies and courts within its jurisdiction.  It is a power to be used sparingly, but does allow fine tuning not confined to the precise issues raised by a particular case.  When a panel of a federal court decides to take this route, it usually circulates its proposed rule to all members of the court for comment and agreement.  It is understandable that an attorney in an appellate court is so immersed in her case that her attention has been rivetted on winning a victory.  \"Victory\" is usually translated into the simple alternatives:  affirmance or reversal.  But the court itself must confront a number of collateral choices having to do with the kind, form, finality, secondary consequences, and timing of decision.  Some of these choices will be seen as immensely important to the litigants and their counsel.  Some chiefly concern the internal workings of the court.  But all are worth some thought on the part of counsel ... in order to be of help both to themselves and the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Unfinished business.  Before a conference ends, the court must reflect on whether decision is the next step.  It may be that, before a novel approach is taken, supplemental memoranda should be requested.  Or perhaps at oral argument they already have been.  Or it may be that, at oral argument, the court has suggested that the parties attempt to settle the case, or that a compromise resolution be explored.  And sometimes, when a case involving the same issue is pending before the Supreme Court, the court will simply defer its decision until The Supreme Court acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Disposition choices.  The two options for a final decision are, of course, to affirm or reverse.  An added subtlety is a decision whether or not to have the mandate (the document that evidences the fact that it the decision is now effective) issue immediately or to allow some time for a petition for certiorari (i.e., a request that the case be accepted for review) to be presented to the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions that are somewhat less than final are those which remand the case to the trial court.  There are many variants:  a remand with instructions only to \"institute proceedings in accordance with this opinion;\" a remand with specific instructions (e.g., in a successful habeas corpus appeal, a remand to the federal district court with instructions to grant the prisoner's freedom unless the state initiates a new trial within ninety days);  a remand for clarification of the court's reasoning, or for essential fact finding;  a remand with or without a requirement to open the record for additional evidence;  and a remand to a different judge.  Each one of these possibilities could be fraught with significance for a litigant;  an advocate would do well to anticipate these choices and be prepared to give advice to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then there are critical choices as to timing.  A basic question is whether a new rule or an extension of existing law should be applicable prospectively or retrospectively.  But there are timing questions relating to the issuance of the instant decision.  Sometimes the panel (if it is a federal court of appeals) knows that one of the issues is being considered by another panel in another case;  some checking with that panel is indicated.  The resry, and conceded that a number of lumber shipments had been made for Masso on lo/lo vessels.  He did testify that \"for a period of time\" in the latter part of 1990 there was no ro/ro vessel servicing Jacksonville, and he also stated that at sales meetings, in trying to anticipate revenues, he would review contracts, including Masso's TVA.  Unable to give more specific testimony because of the sanctions imposed by the court, he gave his conclusory opinion that PRMMI did not provide MASSO with enough ro/ro service to comply with the TVA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence, even viewed most charitably for defendants on the assumption that only ro/ro's were contemplated by the TVA, might support a finding that to some extent at some time PRMMI did not live up to its undertaking.  But it is clear that, contrary to defendants' initial contention, PRMMI did not phase out its ro/ro fleet during the contract period.  Two of the three ro/ro vessels remained in service for the duration.  It is also clear that, except for one period of time of uncertain length, there was no failure to provide ro/ro service to any port.  Generally, the temporary unavailability of a vessel resulted in biweekly rather than weekly service for a post.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is left completely unclear is any basis for assessing the magnitude of any breach on PRMMI's part, to determine if it was sufficient to justify Masso's failure to book more than half of its promised shipments during the two-year period.  The record is bereft of data as to dates, ports, cargoes, and substituted arrangements relating to shipments frustrated because of a lack of proper equipment.  Moreover, the record contains no evidence of expressed unhappiness, oral or written, over PRMMI's performance;  acquiescence and waiver remain distinct possibilities.  On all of this, we remind ourselves, defendants bore the burden of both going forward with evidence and the ultimate burden of persuasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the record, therefore, we must rule, as a matter of law, that defendants simply failed to support their affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Empresas Masso, Inc., Bloques Masso, Inc., Ferreteria Masso, Inc., Caguas Lumber Yard, Inc., Masso Enterprises, Inc</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
