This sentencing appeal provides\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nan opportunity to clarify the operative standards for identifying\n\nrelevant  conduct under  U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (Nov.  1993).1\n\nWe seize the  opportunity and,  in the end,  affirm the  sentence\n\nimposed below.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          For many years, defendant-appellant  Evangelist Lacroix\n\nearned his livelihood as a building subcontractor in southern New\n\nHampshire.    He  became  acquainted with  the  brothers  Zsofka,\n\nMatthew and Lazlos, who, through entities known as ZLM Realty and\n\n101 Realty  (the Zsofka entities),  planned to develop  a sizable\n\nsingle-family residential  real estate complex  know as  \"Sunview\n\nII.\"   In  late  1985, appellant  and  Matthew  Zsofka  (Zsofka),\n\ntogether with  Zsofka's construction foreman, John  Lee, formed a\n\ncorporation, Alpha Construction Company,  to serve as the general\n\ncontractor for  Sunview II.  Appellant  became Alpha's president,\n\nthough by all accounts Zsofka retained ultimate control.\n\n          Construction and sales proceeded apace until the summer\n\nof  1987, when  demand  began to  slacken.   Alpha  responded  to\n\nadversity by retaining a marketing  agent, Horns of New Hampshire\n\n(HNH),   a  firm  headed  by  Richard  Horn.    Zsofka  and  Horn\n\n                    \n\n     1Because  the case  sub judice  involves a  sentence imposed\n                                   \nunder the June 15, 1988 edition of the sentencing guidelines, see\n                                                                 \ninfra Part II, all  references herein are to that  edition unless\n     \notherwise  noted.    Nonetheless,  the reasoning  and  method  of\nanalysis that  we propose for handling  accomplice attribution in\nthe relevant conduct context are fully applicable to  the current\nversion  of the  controlling guideline,  U.S.S.G.  1B1.3(a)(1)(B)\n(Nov. 1993).\n\n                                2\n\nmasterminded an  illegal scheme  that enabled their  companies to\n\nmarket and sell roughly 90 homes over the following two years.\n\n          The conspirators' plan  was seductively  simple:   they\n\nsecretly gave money,  secured by a late-filed second mortgage, to\n\nany would-be homeowner who lacked the wherewithal for the minimum\n\ndown  payment required by the prospective purchase-money mortgage\n\nlender (usually the Dime Savings Bank).\n\n          Appellant personally  handled 31  closings at  which he\n\nfalsely  represented,  both  orally   and  in  writing,  that  no\n\nundisclosed financing arrangements existed.  Appellant knew these\n\nstatements to be apocryphal when made.  The other 60-odd closings\n\nwere handled  in much  the same  fashion by one  or the  other of\n\nappellant's  coconspirators.  The transactions were structured in\n\nsuch a way that, on paper, Alpha conveyed the houses, but not the\n\nland, to the buyers.   The company received in  excess of $37,000\n\nat  every  closing.   These proceeds  enabled Alpha,  among other\n\nthings,  to assist the Zsofka entities in funding the clandestine\n\nsecond mortgages.\n\n          After  Zsofka  and  Horn  hatched  the  plot, appellant\n\nattended  weekly  staff  meetings  at  which  all  the  closings,\n\nincluding those  handled by others, were  discussed and approved.\n\nAt no fewer than three of these meetings Zsofka preached to those\n\npresent, appellant  among them,  about the importance  of keeping\n\nall secondary financing hidden from the first mortgagees.  Zsofka\n\nalso gave instructions  on how  best to  accomplish this  furtive\n\nfeat.\n\n                                3\n\n          During the under-three-year period  when the scheme was\n\nvelivolant, appellant  drew a total of  approximately $385,000 in\n\nsalary from Alpha.  In sum, as a  part-owner and salaried officer\n\nof Alpha,  appellant  participated  in, or  was  present  at  the\n\ndiscussion of,  every transaction, profited  at least  indirectly\n\nfrom each sale,  and stood to gain more money  later (when and if\n\nthe buyers repaid the second mortgages).\n\n          Over time, many  of the borrowers proved unable  to pay\n\nthe first  mortgages, resulting  in widespread foreclosures  at a\n\nnet  cost to  the  Dime Savings  Bank  in excess  of  $2,800,000.\n\nLosses  of  this magnitude  are seldom  unremarked.   In  1992, a\n\nfederal grand  jury returned  a 102-count indictment  against the\n\nthree Alpha principals and four persons associated with HNH.  The\n\nindictment  charged   appellant  with  conspiracy  to  defraud  a\n\nfederally insured financial institution in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n  371, and with various substantive offenses, including 12 counts\n\nof bank  fraud, 18 U.S.C.    1344, and 12 counts  of making false\n\nstatements  to  a  federally  insured  financial institution,  18\n\nU.S.C.    1014.   After a  17-day trial,  the jury  announced its\n\ninability to reach agreement on  the 24 counts charging appellant\n\nwith the  commission of  substantive offenses,2 but  nevertheless\n\nfound him guilty of conspiring to defraud the Dime Savings Bank.\n\nII.  SENTENCING AND ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n          In July  1993, the  trial judge convened  a disposition\n\n                    \n\n     2The 24 specific offense counts have since been dismissed on\nmotion of the prosecution.\n\n                                4\n\nhearing.   Apparently fearing  potential ex post  facto problems,\n                                                       \n\nthe judge, without objection, consulted the sentencing guidelines\n\nthat  had been in  effect at the time  the conspiracy wound down,\n\nnamely,  the June  15,  1988  edition.    See  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nHarotunian, 920  F.2d 1040,  1041-42 (1st Cir.  1990) (explaining\n          \n\nthat  a sentencing court should apply the guidelines in effect on\n\nthe date of  sentencing unless  doing so will  implicate ex  post\n                                                                 \n\nfacto concerns);  United States  v. Arboleda, 929  F.2d 858,  871\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1991)  (stating that,  if the guidelines  in effect  at\n\nsentencing  are  not  used,  then  members  of  a  conspiracy are\n\nordinarily \"subject to the sentencing guidelines in effect at the\n\ntime of the completion of the conspiracy\").\n\n          Starting with a base offense level of six, see U.S.S.G.\n                                                        \n\n 2F1.1(a),  the  judge  added  ten  levels  on  the  theory  that\n\nappellant shared responsibility for inflicting losses of at least\n\n$2,000,000   (but   less    than   $5,000,000),   see    U.S.S.G.\n                                                     \n\n 2F1.1(b)(1)(K), and  then added two incremental  levels for more\n\nthan  minimal  planning,  see  U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(2)(A).   These\n                             \n\ncalculations yielded an adjusted offense level of 18, which,  for\n\na first offender, produced a  guideline sentencing range (GSR) of\n\n27-33 months.  The court imposed an incarcerative sentence at the\n\nnadir of the range.\n\n          This appeal spotlights the court's determination of the\n\naggregate losses  properly attributable to Lacroix.   Noting that\n\nthe judge  counted transactions handled by  his coconspirators as\n\n\"relevant  conduct\" under U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(1), and, therefore,\n\n                                5\n\ntagged him with the  entire loss suffered by the  defrauded bank,\n\nLacroix assigns  error.   He contends  that the  sentencing court\n\nmisconceived the applicable  test for  relevant conduct,  mounted\n\ntoo shallow an inquiry into the subject, and, in all events, that\n\nthe  court  found  the  facts  in  a   quixotic  manner,  thereby\n\nmisapplying the test.\n\n          Appellant's   first  contention  poses  a  question  of\n\nguideline  interpretation,  which sparks  de  novo  review.   See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v.  DeLuca, 17 F.3d  6, 7 (1st Cir.  1994) (holding\n                        \n\nthat, when \"an  appeal raises a  purely legal question  involving\n\nthe proper interpretation of the sentencing  guideline, appellate\n\nreview is plenary\"); United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698,  701\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir.  1992) (similar).   Appellant's second  contention also\n\nposes  a pure question  of law and is,  therefore, to be reviewed\n\nunder  the same  standard.   Appellant's third contention  is cut\n\nfrom  different cloth;  it  hinges on  a factbound  determination\n\nunder the applicable guideline,  thus evoking clear error review.\n\nSee United  States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 605 (1st Cir. 1990);\n                             \n\nsee also  United States v.  Brandon, 17  F.3d 409, 458  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1994) (holding  that valuation of losses  for sentencing purposes\n\nmust be  reviewed under the  clear error standard),  petition for\n                                                                 \n\ncert. filed (U.S. May 16, 1994) (No. 93-9135).\n           \n\nIII.  FORMULATING THE RELEVANT CONDUCT INQUIRY\n\n          It is beyond serious  question that the losses stemming\n\nfrom the 31 transactions  closed by appellant constitute relevant\n\n                                6\n\nconduct under  U.S.S.G.  1B1.3(a)(1).3   Less obvious  is whether\n\nthe remaining transactions, approximately 60 in number, closed by\n\ncoconspirators, may  be attributed to  him.  This  appeal centers\n\naround appellant's insistence that the court below misinterpreted\n\nthe  test  governing  what  the Third  Circuit  aptly  has called\n\n\"accomplice attribution,\" see United  States v. Collado, 975 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n985,  990 (3d Cir. 1992), by taking  too permissive a view of the\n\ntest's foreseeability prong.\n\n               A.  The Accomplice Attribution Test.\n                                                  \n\n          The accomplice attribution test is restated in the case\n\nlaw with great  frequency, but rarely in  quite the same form  or\n\nwith quite the same emphasis.  Thus, our perlustration must start\n\nwith the guideline itself.\n\n                    \n\n     3U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(1)  has  always encompassed  both  acts\nperformed  personally   by  a   defendant  and  acts   of  others\nattributable  to  that  defendant   as  relevant  conduct.    The\nbarebones 1988 version, applied by the court below, treated these\ntwo types of  relevant conduct  in separate clauses  of the  same\nprovision, defining  relevant conduct as \"all  acts and omissions\ncommitted or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for which the\ndefendant would  be otherwise accountable .  . . .\"   In the most\nrecent version  of the guidelines, the taxonomy  is elaborated at\ngreater length, and the two types of relevant conduct are treated\nin    separate    provisions,    namely,    1B1.3(a)(1)(A)    and\n 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  The category designed to include the first type\nof  relevant  conduct    the  defendant's  own  acts    has  been\nrephrased  to make clear that it includes \"all acts and omissions\ncommitted,   aided,   abetted,  counseled,   commanded,  induced,\nprocured, or willfully  caused by  the defendant.\"   We need  not\ndwell  on  this  linguistic  change,  since  the  acts  committed\npersonally by  Lacroix  constitute  relevant  conduct  under  any\nconceivable interpretation of  the guidelines,  past or  present.\nHowever, the Commission's clarification of the second category of\nrelevant  conduct     the  acts  of others  attributable  to  the\ndefendant   is significant  to the task at hand,  and, therefore,\nwe discuss  it at some  length, see infra  note 4 &amp;  accompanying\n                                         \ntext.\n\n                                7\n\n          In  its  current iteration,4  the  applicable guideline\n\nstates that relevant conduct includes \"all reasonably foreseeable\n\nacts and  omissions  of  others  in furtherance  of  the  jointly\n\nundertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission\n\nof the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or\n\nin the  course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility\n\nfor  that   offense.\"    U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(1)(B)  (Nov.  1993).\n\nReading the  1988  version of  section  1B1.3(a)(1) in  light  of\n\nsubsequent clarifying  amendments to  both the guideline  and its\n\ncommentary,  we  understand  the  Sentencing Commission  to  have\n\nmandated  a two-part  inquiry for  accomplice attribution  in the\n\nrelevant  conduct  milieu.    First, the  sentencing  court  must\n\ndetermine  what acts and omissions  of others were in furtherance\n\nof the  defendant's jointly  undertaken criminal activity.   This\n\ntask requires  the court to  ascertain what activity  fell within\n\nthe  scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the\n\ndefendant's agreement  (whether explicit or tacit).   Second, the\n\ncourt must  determine to what  extent others' acts  and omissions\n\nthat were in furtherance  of jointly undertaken criminal activity\n\nlikely  would have  been foreseeable  by a  reasonable person  in\n\n                    \n\n     4The Sentencing Commission amended U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(1) in\n1989 and again  in 1992.  See  U.S.S.G. App. C, Amends.  78 &amp; 439\n                             \n(Nov. 1993); see also Collado, 975 F.2d at 991-92 (analyzing 1989\n                             \namendment);  United States v.  O'Campo, 973 F.2d  1015, 1023 n.6,\n                                      \n1024  nn.  8-9,  1025  n.10  (1st  Cir.  1992)  (discussing  both\namendments).    Because the  Sentencing  Commission  has labelled\nthese  amendments  as  \"clarifying\"  in nature,  rather  than  as\nrevisionary, they may be  taken into account retrospectively, not\nonly by  the sentencing  court, see U.S.S.G.   1B1.11(b)(2) (Nov.\n                                   \n1993),  but also on appeal, see United States v. Valencia-Lucena,\n                                                                \n988 F.2d 228, 234 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                8\n\ndefendant's shoes at the time of his or her agreement.5\n\n          We think it is important  to emphasize that the vantage\n\npoint  for  the  foreseeability  judgment  is  the  time  of  the\n\ndefendant's agreement    not  necessarily the time  he personally\n\nundertook  the performance of  criminal activity, or  the time of\n\nhis entry into the conspiracy.  Siting the vantage  point in this\n\nway has  at least  two salient  implications.  For  one thing,  a\n\ncourt  examining relevant  conduct may  attribute to  a defendant\n\nacts  committed by his accomplices prior to the commission of his\n\nown acts, so long as they occur subsequent to his agreement.  For\n\nanother  thing,  because a  single  defendant  may make  multiple\n\nagreements or expand an existing agreement, a defendant sometimes\n\nmay  be chargeable  with losses  arising out  of conduct  that he\n\ncould not have foreseen at the time he entered the conspiracy, so\n\n                    \n\n     5We  have   considered  the  possibility  that   the  latest\nreformulation  of application  note 2, U.S.S.G.   1B1.3, comment.\n(n.2)  (Nov. 1993), mandates  a compound finding,  such that, for\n\"conduct\" to be \"relevant,\" the accomplice's act would have to be\n\"in furtherance of activity  within the scope of agreement.\"   We\nreject this refinement for  two reasons.  First, the  language of\nthe guideline itself refers only to the concepts of \"furtherance\"\nand \"foreseeability.\"   Second,  application note  2,  read as  a\nwhole, appears  to use  \"in furtherance\"  and \"within  the scope\"\ninterchangeably    a  practice consistent  with earlier  usage in\nboth  the commentary  and  the case  law.   See,  e.g.,  U.S.S.G.\n                                                      \n 1B1.3,  comment. (n.1) (Nov. 1991) (stating, within the space of\na  few lines,  that  conduct  for  which  a  defendant  would  be\notherwise accountable includes conduct of others \"in  furtherance\nof the execution of the jointly undertaken criminal activity that\nwas   reasonably  foreseeable\"  and  excludes  conduct  that  was\n\"neither within  the scope of  the defendant's agreement  nor was\nreasonably foreseeable\");  United States v. Garcia,  954 F.2d 12,\n                                                  \n15-16 (1st Cir.  1992) (similar);  see generally  Paul J.

Sent.

There has\n\nnever  been any  suggestion  that the  60-something  transactions\n\nclosed by  appellant's coconspirators  were outside the  scope of\n\nappellant's   agreement,  or,   put  another   way,   that  those\n\ntransactions  were  other  than  in furtherance  of  the  jointly\n\nundertaken criminal  activity.   Consequently, this  appeal turns\n\nexclusively on the issue of foreseeability.\n\n                     B.  The Findings Below.\n                                           \n\n          At the disposition hearing, defense counsel argued that\n\nappellant could not  have foreseen  the conduct of  others.   The\n\nlower  court treated this  argument as  calling into  question an\n\napplication of the guidelines.  The court then proceeded to find,\n\nbased on the trial evidence and the jury verdict, that:\n\n               Mr.   Lacroix   was  involved   in  this\n          conspiracy from  the beginning.  He was aware\n          of  the nature and  extent of the development\n          that was involved, the development that Alpha\n          was involved in.  He was aware of the cost of\n          the homes.  He  was aware of the profit  that\n          was being received, and he was also receiving\n          salaries   from   Alpha,  $173,000   in  '87,\n          $187,000 in '88, $25,000 in '89.\n\n               So in  the opinion  of the Court  he was\n          well  aware  of  the  magnitude  of  what was\n          happening  here, and .  . . under  all of the\n          circumstances in which  he was involved,  the\n          foreseeability  in  this situation  is really\n          inherent in the nature of the conspiracy that\n          was  involved here,  which  was  a  marketing\n          conspiracy.\n\nIV.  ANALYSIS\n\n                                10\n\n          Appellant says  that the  district court's  findings on\n\nforeseeability are flawed both legally and factually.\n\n                      A.  Questions of Law.\n                                          \n\n          Appellant  raises two predominantly legal challenges to\n\nthe court's  formulation  of the  relevant conduct  inquiry.   We\n\ninspect each challenge in turn.\n\n          1.  Mere Awareness.   Appellant seizes on  the district\n          1.  Mere Awareness.\n                            \n\ncourt's  repeated use of the  word \"aware\" and  suggests that its\n\nrecurrence  betokens a  single-minded  focus  on the  defendant's\n\nknowledge.  This  focus is impermissible, appellant  asseverates,\n\nbecause a finding of  \"mere awareness,\" in and of  itself, cannot\n\nbe   equated  with,   and   does  not   justify,  a   finding  of\n\nforeseeability  in  the sentencing  phase.   Despite  appellant's\n\ncitations  to several  cases, his  asseveration begs  the pivotal\n\nquestion.   Awareness does not  always bear on  foreseeability in\n\nprecisely  (or even  roughly) the  same way.   To  understand the\n\ninferences that lawfully can be drawn from awareness in any given\n\nsituation,  a  court must  first  assess  the particular  factual\n\nsetting and then answer the question:  \"Awareness of what?\"\n\n          The four cases upon which appellant principally relies,\n\nread carefully,  underscore this necessity.   The first  of them,\n\nUnited States  v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d  1015, is a case  in which we\n                         \n\nadmonished sentencing  judges not  to equate mere  knowledge with\n\nforeseeability    but  we  were referring  specifically to  \"mere\n\nknowledge of  historic facts.\"  Id.  at 1025.  By  this, we meant\n                                   \n\nthat the foreseeability of acts performed after defendant's entry\n                                               \n\n                                11\n\ninto  a  conspiracy  could  not  be  established  by  his   \"mere\n\nknowledge\"  of  acts  performed  prior  to  his  entry  into  the\n                                      \n\nconspiracy.6   See  id.  at  1026;  see  also  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nCarreon,  11  F.3d  1225,  1234-37 (5th  Cir.  1994)  (discussing\n       \n\nO'Campo).  Since Lacroix was  involved in the instant  conspiracy\n       \n\nfrom  the start,  the stratagemical  acts of  which he  was aware\n\nnecessarily occurred after his entry into  the conspiracy.  Thus,\n\nO'Campo is  inapposite because  it did not  deal with  post-entry\n       \n\nacts.\n\n          The remaining three  cases upon which appellant  relies\n\nadvance   the  bland  proposition   that  foreseeability  is  not\n\ndispositively established  by mere awareness of  the existence or\n                                                                 \n\nillegality  of a conspiracy.  See United States v. Evbuomwan, 992\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 70, 74 (5th Cir. 1993) (explaining that \"mere knowledge that\n\ncriminal activity  is taking place is not enough\"); United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Valencia-Lucena, 988 F.2d 228, 234 (1st Cir. 1993) (suggesting\n                  \n\nthat individuals may  \"know that the agreement they  have entered\n\nis  illegal  but  [nevertheless]  have  no  way  to  foresee  the\n\nmagnitude  or  ambition of  the  enterprise\");  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nEdwards, 945  F.2d 1387,  1393 (7th  Cir. 1991)  (commenting that\n       \n\n\"foreseeability  means  more than subjective awareness . . . that\n\n[an  accomplice] headed  a  long-standing  and successful  heroin\n\n                    \n\n     6We note in passing  that the O'Campo court did not say that\n                                          \nawareness   of   pre-entry   acts  was   bereft   of  evidentiary\nsignificance  in determining  the  foreseeability  of  post-entry\nacts.   The court said  the opposite.   See O'Campo, 973  F.2d at\n                                                   \n1026 (stating that \"knowledge of . . . prior acts will inform the\njudgment about what [defendant] reasonably could have foreseen\").\n\n                                12\n\ndistribution network\"), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1590 (1992).  We\n                                    \n\nfind no  fault with these cases   but we caution that the courts'\n\nwords cannot be read in a  vacuum.  Awareness, even if limited to\n\nknowledge of  a conspiracy's  unlawfulness, is always  (or almost\n\nalways)  relevant to the question of foreseeability   and none of\n\nthe cited cases suggest the contrary.\n\n          More importantly, these three  cases do not in  any way\n\ndenigrate the possibility that  foreseeability may be established\n\nby  a  different kind  of awareness,  that  is, by  a defendant's\n\nknowledge of the nature and extent of a conspiracy in which he is\n                                                                 \n\ninvolved.   This, of course,  is exactly the  stripe of awareness\n        \n\ndetected by the court below.  It is both good  law and good logic\n\nthat  a  defendant's   awareness  of  the  inner  workings  of  a\n\nconspiracy  in which he is participating is germane to, and often\n\nhighly probative of, accomplice  attribution.  Although appellant\n\nmay  choose  to characterize  such  intimate  knowledge as  \"mere\n\nawareness\"    a term that we view as verging on the oxymoronic in\n\na case like this one    he is fishing  in an empty stream.   Such\n\nknowledge  frequently  will  suffice  to  prove  the  defendant's\n\nability to foresee the acts of coconspirators.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Roberts, 14 F.3d 502, 525 (10th Cir. 1993) (concluding\n                  \n\nthat  a  defendant's  knowledge that  the  accomplice  habitually\n\ncarried  a  firearm  justified  a finding  that  defendant  could\n\nreasonably  foresee that  accomplice would  carry the gun  on the\n\noccasion in question).\n\n          \"Foreseeability\"  is  conventionally  defined   as  the\n\n                                13\n\n\"ability to see or know in advance.\"  Black's Law Dictionary  649\n                                                            \n\n(6th  ed. 1990).  Viewed in that light, a \"reasonably foreseeable\n\nact\"  might well be  regarded as an act  that a reasonable person\n\nwho knew everything  that the  defendant knew at  the time  would\n\nhave  been  able  to  know  in advance  with  a  fair  degree  of\n\nprobability.    Giving  due  weight to  the  intimate  connection\n\nbetween knowledge  and foreseeability,  we conclude that  in this\n\ncase it was both permissible and advisable for the district court\n\nto consider appellant's awareness  of the conspiracy's nature and\n\nscope en  route to  an ultimate determination  on foreseeability.\n\nThe  district court,  therefore, did  not misconstrue  either the\n\nelements of the accomplice  attribution test or the way  in which\n\nthe test should operate.\n\n          2.    The  Nature  of the  Inquiry.    Appellant's next\n          2.    The  Nature  of the  Inquiry.\n                                            \n\nargument is pitched in a somewhat different direction.  He points\n\nto a Third Circuit directive that instructs district courts, when\n\nconsidering  accomplice  attribution  in  the   relevant  conduct\n\ncontext, to  embark upon \"a searching  and individualized inquiry\n\ninto the circumstances  surrounding each defendant's  involvement\n\nin the conspiracy.\"  Collado,  975 F.2d at 995.  He  then invites\n                            \n\nus to adopt this  standard and calumnizes the district  court for\n\nmounting an inquiry that supposedly fell short of it.  We believe\n\nthat this argument is largely an exercise in semantics.\n\n          In  the  first  place,  the invitation  that  appellant\n\nextends  is  wholly  gratuitous.  We already  have  endorsed  the\n\nprinciple  of  a  searching  and individualized  inquiry  in  the\n\n                                14\n\nrelevant conduct  context.  See, e.g., United  States v. Balogun,\n                                                                \n\n989 F.2d 20, 22  (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that a sentencing court\n\nordinarily must make  specific, individualized findings regarding\n\nforeseeability for each defendant).7   Indeed, the Third Circuit,\n\nin constructing the rule appellant urges us to \"adopt,\" cites our\n\nopinion in United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12  (1st Cir. 1992),\n                                  \n\nas a model.  See Collado, 975 F.2d at 995.  The mere fact that we\n                        \n\nhave  employed  slightly  different phraseology  than  the  Third\n\nCircuit  is of no consequence.   The adjectives  used in Collado,\n                                                                \n\nwhile concinnous, are neither talismans nor words of art.\n\n          The second  half  of appellant's  argument  is  equally\n\nmeritless.   Here,  the  district  court honored  the  spirit  of\n\nBalogun by making extensive findings regarding the foreseeability\n       \n\nof  others' acts from appellant's vantage point.  Since the court\n\npresided  over a 17-day trial and based its findings, inter alia,\n                                                                \n\n\"on all of the evidence that the Court heard during the course of\n\nthe trial,\" it strains credulity to describe the inquiry below as\n\ninsufficiently searching.   We are  hard pressed to  imagine what\n\nmore the district court might have  done   and appellant, for all\n\n                    \n\n     7In  Balogun,  we  mused  that  there  might  be a  possible\n                 \nexception to this rule  in the rare case where  foreseeability is\n\"inherent  in the nature\" of a particular conspiracy. 989 F.2d at\n22.   We  have  yet to  probe  the  parameters of  this  possible\nexception, nor do we need to do  so today.  We note only that the\ndistrict   court's  seemingly  misplaced  allusion  to  Balogun's\n                                                               \n\"inherent  in  the nature\"  language, see  supra  at p.  10, does\n                                                \nlittle to shed light upon the court's conclusions.  Consequently,\nwe  rely  on  the  district judge's  individualized  findings  in\nrespect   to  foreseeability,   and   treat   his  comment   that\nforeseeability \"is really inherent in the nature of [a marketing]\nconspiracy\" as mere surplusage.\n\n                                15\n\nhis lamentations, has not advanced a single concrete suggestion.\n\n                      B.  Questions of Fact.\n                                           \n\n          Appellant's  fallback  position is  that,  even  if the\n\ndistrict  court applied  the  proper legal  rules in  determining\n\nrelevant conduct,  its findings  of fact were  clearly erroneous.\n\nThe facts  of the case,  taken without embellishment,  expose the\n\nfallacy in appellant's position.\n\n          To  be sure, Lacroix was neither the progenitor nor the\n\nmoving  spirit  of the  conspiracy, but  he  helped to  found it,\n\nretained  a proprietary  interest in it,  and played  an integral\n\npart in its operation.   Moreover, he served as the  titular head\n\nof the firm that  oversaw the construction, marketing, financing,\n\nand sale of every  home.  The record supports   indeed, virtually\n\ncompels     an  inference  that  appellant  understood  from  the\n\ninception  that the object of the conspiracy was to sell homes by\n\nhook or by crook.  Taking the district court's explicit findings,\n\nand  fleshing them out with  details derived from  the record, we\n\nunderstand the  court to have  concluded that appellant  knew all\n\nalong the sums involved in each transaction and the  conspiracy's\n\nmethod of  operation    selling houses  to unqualified  buyers by\n\nproviding, and then fraudulently concealing, secondary financing.\n\nBecause  any reasonable  person in  appellant's position,  at the\n\ntime  of his agreement, would have recognized that ninety or more\n\nhomes might be sold  in this corrupt fashion, the court below did\n\nnot  err in  concluding that  all the  losses resulting  from the\n\n                                16\n\nsales were fairly attributable to Lacroix.8\n\n          Appellant  cannot  deny this  analysis  in  any of  its\n\nparticulars,  and, in  fairness, does  not really  try to  do so.\n\nInstead, he seeks  to escape  the force of  the district  court's\n\nreasoning  by introducing  three  extraneous considerations.   At\n\nbottom,  this  endeavor  reflects  a  basic  misunderstanding  of\n\nsentencing principles.\n\n          First,   appellant   insists   that   a    finding   of\n\nforeseeability  is undermined  by the  jury verdict.   We  do not\n\nagree.  The jury  did not exonerate appellant in  connection with\n\nthe substantive  offense counts; rather, it  simply deadlocked on\n\nthese counts.    Its  verdict,  therefore, did  not  resolve  the\n\ncontested issues either way, but left them up in the air.\n\n          Moreover, the method of the  guidelines is to leave  to\n\nthe  sentencing judge,  not the  jury, the determination  of what\n\n\"conduct\"  is  \"relevant\"  to  the fashioning  of  a  defendant's\n\nsentence.   See United States v. Limberopoulos,     F.3d    ,    \n                                              \n\n(1st Cir.  1994) [No. 92-1954, slip op. at 15]; see also U.S.S.G.\n                                                        \n\n 6A1.3.  Thus, even a trial jury's refusal to find that a certain\n\nfact has  been proven beyond a reasonable  doubt will not bar the\n\ndistrict  court  from  making  precisely  that  same  finding  at\n\n                    \n\n     8In our view,  this is  an especially potent  case for  such\nattribution.  Above and  beyond what the government had  to prove\nin respect  to that issue,  appellant could easily  have foreseen\nthat the  coconspirators' method of  operation carried with  it a\nheightened chance  of default  and foreclosure.   Thus, appellant\ncould foresee  the consequences  of the illegal  marketing scheme\nand the magnitude of  the attendant financial risks to  which the\nbedeviled mortgage lender might fall prey.\n\n                                17\n\nsentencing, under a  preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.   On\n\nthis basis, we have held squarely that a defendant's acquittal on\n\na  particular  count  does   not  limit  the  sentencing  court's\n\nflexibility in  considering the same underlying  facts in respect\n\nto the count  of conviction.  See United States  v. Mocciola, 891\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).  A fortiori, the case for permitting\n                                        \n\njudges free rein to make whatever findings the record can support\n\nis airtight where,  as here,  trial on the  disputed counts  ends\n\nwith a hung jury rather than an acquittal.\n\n          Second,  appellant presents  himself as  a babe  in the\n\nwoods, an  uneducated carpenter  in the company  of sophisticated\n\nentrepreneurs.  For what this jeremiad may be worth insofar as it\n\nbears  upon  accomplice  attribution,  it was  tendered  to,  and\n\nrejected by, the  district judge.9   We discern  no clear  error.\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States v.  Ruiz, 905 F.2d  499, 508 (1st  Cir.\n                                  \n\n1990) (acknowledging that \"where there is more than one plausible\n\nview of  the circumstances,  the sentencing court's  choice among\n\nsupportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").\n\n          Third, and relatedly, appellant  harps on the fact that\n\nZsofka and  Horn called the tune, to which he merely danced.  But\n\nthe concepts of \"relevant conduct\" and \"role\" are distinct in the\n\nworld  of the sentencing guidelines.  See United States v. Lilly,\n                                                                \n\n13 F.3d 15, 18-19 (1st  Cir. 1994).  Whereas the former  helps to\n\n                    \n\n     9We note in  passing that the  judge sentenced appellant  at\nthe  lowest point  in  the GSR,  a  determination that,  to  some\nextent,  may have taken into account appellant's supposed lack of\nsophistication.\n\n                                18\n\ngauge the gravity of an offense, the latter helps to measure  the\n\noffender's culpability.   See  id.   Hence, the  district court's\n                                  \n\nattribution  of the entire  loss to appellant  is not  in any way\n\ninconsistent  with  the  fact that  he  may  have  played only  a\n\nsupporting role.10\n\n          We need go no further.  The short of it is that none of\n\nthe  factors  upon which  appellant  dwells cast  doubt  upon the\n\ndistrict court's ascertainment of the amount of loss attributable\n\nto appellant  in connection with the  jointly undertaken criminal\n\nactivity.  Consequently, we cannot say that the lower court erred\n\nin constructing the sentencing calculus.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     10Of  course, the  guidelines permit  a sentencing  court to\nreduce  a  defendant's offense  level  for  \"minor\" or  \"minimal\"\nparticipation in the offense of conviction.  See U.S.S.G.  3B1.2.\n                                                \nAppellant did  not seek such an adjustment  below and, therefore,\ncannot  challenge the lack of such an  adjustment on appeal.  See\n                                                                 \nUnited States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d  50, 55 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding\n                      \nthat sentencing arguments not seasonably advanced below cannot be\nintroduced for the  first time on  appeal).  At  any rate,  while\nothers  may  have  been the  ringleaders,  we  see  no basis  for\ncharacterizing appellant's role as \"minor\" or \"minimal.\"\n\n                                19\n",

Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (Nov.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We seize the opportunity and, in the end, affirm the sentence imposed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For many years, defendant-appellant Evangelist LaCroix earned his livelihood as a building subcontractor in southern New Hampshire.  He became acquainted with the brothers Zsofka, Matthew and Lazlos, who, through entities known as ZLM Realty and 101 Realty (the Zsofka entities), planned to develop a sizable single-family residential real estate complex known as \"Sunview II.\"   In late 1985, appellant and Matthew Zsofka (Zsofka), together with Zsofka's construction foreman, John Lee, formed a corporation, Alpha Construction Company, to serve as the general contractor for Sunview II.  Appellant became Alpha's president, though by all accounts Zsofka retained ultimate control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construction and sales proceeded apace until the summer of 1987, when demand began to slacken.  Alpha responded to adversity by retaining a marketing agent, Horns of New Hampshire (HNH), a firm headed by Richard Horn.  Zsofka and Horn masterminded an illegal scheme that enabled their companies to market and sell roughly 90 homes over the following two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspirators' plan was seductively simple:  they secretly gave money, secured by a late-filed second mortgage, to any would-be homeowner who lacked the wherewithal for the minimum down payment required by the prospective purchase-money mortgage lender (usually the Dime Savings Bank).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant personally handled 31 closings at which he falsely represented, both orally and in writing, that no undisclosed financing arrangements existed.  Appellant knew these statements to be apocryphal when made.  The other 60-odd closings were handled in much the same fashion by one or the other of appellant's coconspirators.  The transactions were structured in such a way that, on paper, Alpha conveyed the houses, but not the land, to the buyers.  The company received in excess of $37,000 at every closing.  These proceeds enabled Alpha, among other things, to assist the Zsofka entities in funding the clandestine second mortgages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Zsofka and Horn hatched the plot, appellant attended weekly staff meetings at which all the closings, including those handled by others, were discussed and approved.  At no fewer than three of these meetings Zsofka preached to those present, appellant among them, about the importance of keeping all secondary financing hidden from the first mortgagees.  Zsofka also gave instructions on how best to accomplish this furtive feat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the under-three-year period when the scheme was velivolant, appellant drew a total of approximately $385,000 in salary from Alpha.  In sum, as a part-owner and salaried officer of Alpha, appellant participated in, or was present at the discussion of, every transaction, profited at least indirectly from each sale, and stood to gain more money later (when and if the buyers repaid the second mortgages).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over time, many of the borrowers proved unable to pay the first mortgages, resulting in widespread foreclosures at a net cost to the Dime Savings Bank in excess of $2,800,000.  Losses of this magnitude are seldom unremarked.  In 1992, a federal grand jury returned a 102-count indictment against the three Alpha principals and four persons associated with HNH.  The indictment charged appellant with conspiracy to defraud a federally insured financial institution in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, and with various substantive offenses, including 12 counts of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344, and 12 counts of making false statements to a federally insured financial institution, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.  After a 17-day trial, the jury announced its inability to reach agreement on the 24 counts charging appellant with the commission of substantive offenses,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but nevertheless found him guilty of conspiring to defraud the Dime Savings Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. SENTENCING AND ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1993, the trial judge convened a disposition hearing.  Apparently fearing potential ex post facto problems, the judge, without objection, consulted the sentencing guidelines that had been in effect at the time the conspiracy wound down, namely, the June 15, 1988 edition.  See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that a sentencing court should apply the guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing unless doing so will implicate ex post facto concerns);  United States v. Arboleda, 929 F.2d 858, 871 (1st Cir.1991) (stating that, if the guidelines in effect at sentencing are not used, then members of a conspiracy are ordinarily \"subject to the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of the completion of the conspiracy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with a base offense level of six, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(a), the judge added ten levels on the theory that appellant shared responsibility for inflicting losses of at least $2,000,000 (but less than $5,000,000), see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1)(K), and then added two incremental levels for more than minimal planning, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2)(A).  These calculations yielded an adjusted offense level of 18, which, for a first offender, produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 27-33 months.  The court imposed an incarcerative sentence at the nadir of the range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal spotlights the court's determination of the aggregate losses properly attributable to LaCroix.  Noting that the judge counted transactions handled by his coconspirators as \"relevant conduct\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1), and, therefore, tagged him with the entire loss suffered by the defrauded bank, LaCroix assigns error.  He contends that the sentencing court misconceived the applicable test for relevant conduct, mounted too shallow an inquiry into the subject, and, in all events, that the court found the facts in a quixotic manner, thereby misapplying the test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's first contention poses a question of guideline interpretation, which sparks de novo review.  See United States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 7 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that, when \"an appeal raises a purely legal question involving the proper interpretation of the sentencing guideline, appellate review is plenary\");  United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992) (similar).  Appellant's second contention also poses a pure question of law and is, therefore, to be reviewed under the same standard.  Appellant's third contention is cut from different cloth;  it hinges on a factbound determination under the applicable guideline, thus evoking clear error review.  See United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 605 (1st Cir.1990);  see also United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 458 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that valuation of losses for sentencing purposes must be reviewed under the clear error standard), petition for cert. filed (U.S. May 16, 1994) (No. 93-9135).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. FORMULATING THE RELEVANT CONDUCT INQUIRY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond serious question that the losses stemming from the 31 transactions closed by appellant constitute relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1).<sup>3</sup>  Less obvious is whether the remaining transactions, approximately 60 in number, closed by coconspirators, may be attributed to him.  This appeal centers around appellant's insistence that the court below misinterpreted the test governing what the Third Circuit aptly has called \"accomplice attribution,\" see United States v. Collado, 975 F.2d 985, 990 (3d Cir.1992), by taking too permissive a view of the test's foreseeability prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A. The Accomplice Attribution Test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The accomplice attribution test is restated in the case law with great frequency, but rarely in quite the same form or with quite the same emphasis.  Thus, our perlustration must start with the guideline itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its current iteration,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the applicable guideline states that relevant conduct includes \"all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (Nov.1993).  Reading the 1988 version of section 1B1.3(a)(1) in light of subsequent clarifying amendments to both the guideline and its commentary, we understand the Sentencing Commission to have mandated a two-part inquiry for accomplice attribution in the relevant conduct milieu.  First, the sentencing court must determine what acts and omissions of others were in furtherance of the defendant's jointly undertaken criminal activity.  This task requires the court to ascertain what activity fell within the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant's agreement (whether explicit or tacit).  Second, the court must determine to what extent others' acts and omissions that were in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity likely would have been foreseeable by a reasonable person in defendant's shoes at the time of his or her agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is important to emphasize that the vantage point for the foreseeability judgment is the time of the defendant's agreement--not necessarily the time he personally undertook the performance of criminal activity, or the time of his entry into the conspiracy.  Siting the vantage point in this way has at least two salient implications.  For one thing, a court examining relevant conduct may attribute to a defendant acts committed by his accomplices prior to the commission of his own acts, so long as they occur subsequent to his agreement.  For another thing, because a single defendant may make multiple agreements or expand an existing agreement, a defendant sometimes may be chargeable with losses arising out of conduct that he could not have foreseen at the time he entered the conspiracy, so long as such conduct was foreseeable at the time that he signaled his agreement to the expanded scope of jointly undertaken criminal activity embracing such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the inquiry may be truncated.  There has never been any suggestion that the 60-something transactions closed by appellant's coconspirators were outside the scope of appellant's agreement, or, put another way, that those transactions were other than in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.  Consequently, this appeal turns exclusively on the issue of foreseeability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>B. The Findings Below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, defense counsel argued that appellant could not have foreseen the conduct of others.  The lower court treated this argument as calling into question an application of the guidelines.  The court then proceeded to find, based on the trial evidence and the jury verdict, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Lacroix was involved in this conspiracy from the beginning.  He was aware of the nature and extent of the development that was involved, the development that Alpha was involved in.  He was aware of the cost of the homes.  He was aware of the profit that was being received, and he was also receiving salaries from Alpha, $173,000 in '87, $187,000 in '88, $25,000 in '89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So in the opinion of the Court he was well aware of the magnitude of what was happening here, and ... under all of the circumstances in which he was involved, the foreseeability in this situation is really inherent in the nature of the conspiracy that was involved here, which was a marketing conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant says that the district court's findings on foreseeability are flawed both legally and factually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>A. Questions of Law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant raises two predominantly legal challenges to the court's formulation of the relevant conduct inquiry.  We inspect each challenge in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Mere Awareness.   Appellant seizes on the district court's repeated use of the word \"aware\" and suggests that its recurrence betokens a single-minded focus on the defendant's knowledge.  This focus is impermissible, appellant asseverates, because a finding of \"mere awareness,\" in and of itself, cannot be equated with, and does not justify, a finding of foreseeability in the sentencing phase.  Despite appellant's citations to several cases, his asseveration begs the pivotal question.  Awareness does not always bear on foreseeability in precisely (or even roughly) the same way.  To understand the inferences that lawfully can be drawn from awareness in any given situation, a court must first assess the particular factual setting and then answer the question:  \"Awareness of what?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The four cases upon which appellant principally relies, read carefully, underscore this necessity.  The first of them, United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, is a case in which we admonished sentencing judges not to equate mere knowledge with foreseeability--but we were referring specifically to \"mere knowledge of historic facts.\"  Id. at 1025.   By this, we meant that the foreseeability of acts performed after defendant's entry into a conspiracy could not be established by his \"mere knowledge\" of acts performed prior to his entry into the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See id. at 1026;  see also United States v. Carreon, 11 F.3d 1225, 1234-37 (5th Cir.1994) (discussing O'Campo ).   Since LaCroix was involved in the instant conspiracy from the start, the stratagemical acts of which he was aware necessarily occurred after his entry into the conspiracy.  Thus, O'Campo is inapposite because it did not deal with post-entry acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining three cases upon which appellant relies advance the bland proposition that foreseeability is not dispositively established by mere awareness of the existence or illegality of a conspiracy.   See United States v. Evbuomwan, 992 F.2d 70, 74 (5th Cir.1993) (explaining that \"mere knowledge that criminal activity is taking place is not enough\");  United States v. Valencia-Lucena, 988 F.2d 228, 234 (1st Cir.1993) (suggesting that individuals may \"know that the agreement they have entered is illegal but [nevertheless] have no way to foresee the magnitude or ambition of the enterprise\");  United States v. Edwards, 945 F.2d 1387, 1393 (7th Cir.1991) (commenting that \"foreseeability means more than subjective awareness ... that [an accomplice] headed a long-standing and successful heroin distribution network\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1590, 118 L.Ed.2d 308 (1992).  We find no fault with these cases--but we caution that the courts' words cannot be read in a vacuum.  Awareness, even if limited to knowledge of a conspiracy's unlawfulness, is always (or almost always) relevant to the question of foreseeability--and none of the cited cases suggest the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, these three cases do not in any way denigrate the possibility that foreseeability may be established by a different kind of awareness, that is, by a defendant's knowledge of the nature and extent of a conspiracy in which he is involved.   This, of course, is exactly the stripe of awareness detected by the court below.  It is both good law and good logic that a defendant's awareness of the inner workings of a conspiracy in which he is participating is germane to, and often highly probative of, accomplice attribution.  Although appellant may choose to characterize such intimate knowledge as \"mere awareness\"--a term that we view as verging on the oxymoronic in a case like this one--he is fishing in an empty stream.  Such knowledge frequently will suffice to prove the defendant's ability to foresee the acts of coconspirators.  See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 14 F.3d 502, 525 (10th Cir.1993) (concluding that a defendant's knowledge that the accomplice habitually carried a firearm justified a finding that defendant could reasonably foresee that accomplice would carry the gun on the occasion in question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Foreseeability\" is conventionally defined as the \"ability to see or know in advance.\"   Black's Law Dictionary 649 (6th ed. 1990).  Viewed in that light, a \"reasonably foreseeable act\" might well be regarded as an act that a reasonable person who knew everything that the defendant knew at the time would have been able to know in advance with a fair degree of probability.  Giving due weight to the intimate connection between knowledge and foreseeability, we conclude that in this case it was both permissible and advisable for the district court to consider appellant's awareness of the conspiracy's nature and scope en route to an ultimate determination on foreseeability.  The district court, therefore, did not misconstrue either the elements of the accomplice attribution test or the way in which the test should operate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Nature of the Inquiry.   Appellant's next argument is pitched in a somewhat different direction.  He points to a Third Circuit directive that instructs district courts, when considering accomplice attribution in the relevant conduct context, to embark upon \"a searching and individualized inquiry into the circumstances surrounding each defendant's involvement in the conspiracy.\"  Collado, 975 F.2d at 995.   He then invites us to adopt this standard and calumnizes the district court for mounting an inquiry that supposedly fell short of it.  We believe that this argument is largely an exercise in semantics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the invitation that appellant extends is wholly gratuitous.  We already have endorsed the principle of a searching and individualized inquiry in the relevant conduct context.  See, e.g., United States v. Balogun, 989 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that a sentencing court ordinarily must make specific, individualized findings regarding foreseeability for each defendant).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Indeed, the Third Circuit, in constructing the rule appellant urges us to \"adopt,\" cites our opinion in United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12 (1st Cir.1992), as a model.  See Collado, 975 F.2d at 995.   The mere fact that we have employed slightly different phraseology than the Third Circuit is of no consequence.  The adjectives used in Collado, while concinnous, are neither talismans nor words of art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second half of appellant's argument is equally meritless.  Here, the district court honored the spirit of Balogun by making extensive findings regarding the foreseeability of others' acts from appellant's vantage point.  Since the court presided over a 17-day trial and based its findings, inter alia, \"on all of the evidence that the Court heard during the course of the trial,\" it strains credulity to describe the inquiry below as insufficiently searching.  We are hard pressed to imagine what more the district court might have done--and appellant, for all his lamentations, has not advanced a single concrete suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>B. Questions of Fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's fallback position is that, even if the district court applied the proper legal rules in determining relevant conduct, its findings of fact were clearly erroneous.  The facts of the case, taken without embellishment, expose the fallacy in appellant's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, LaCroix was neither the progenitor nor the moving spirit of the conspiracy, but he helped to found it, retained a proprietary interest in it, and played an integral part in its operation.  Moreover, he served as the titular head of the firm that oversaw the construction, marketing, financing, and sale of every home.  The record supports--indeed, virtually compels--an inference that appellant understood from the inception that the object of the conspiracy was to sell homes by hook or by crook.  Taking the district court's explicit findings, and fleshing them out with details derived from the record, we understand the court to have concluded that appellant knew all along the sums involved in each transaction and the conspiracy's method of operation--selling houses to unqualified buyers by providing, and then fraudulently concealing, secondary financing.  Because any reasonable person in appellant's position, at the time of his agreement, would have recognized that ninety or more homes might be sold in this corrupt fashion, the court below did not err in concluding that all the losses resulting from the sales were fairly attributable to LaCroix.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant cannot deny this analysis in any of its particulars, and, in fairness, does not really try to do so.  Instead, he seeks to escape the force of the district court's reasoning by introducing three extraneous considerations.  At bottom, this endeavor reflects a basic misunderstanding of sentencing principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, appellant insists that a finding of foreseeability is undermined by the jury verdict.  We do not agree.  The jury did not exonerate appellant in connection with the substantive offense counts;  rather, it simply deadlocked on these counts.  Its verdict, therefore, did not resolve the contested issues either way, but left them up in the air.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the method of the guidelines is to leave to the sentencing judge, not the jury, the determination of what \"conduct\" is \"relevant\" to the fashioning of a defendant's sentence.  See United States v. Limberopoulos, 26 F.3d 245, 251-52 (1st Cir.1994);  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3.  Thus, even a trial jury's refusal to find that a certain fact has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt will not bar the district court from making precisely that same finding at sentencing, under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.  On this basis, we have held squarely that a defendant's acquittal on a particular count does not limit the sentencing court's flexibility in considering the same underlying facts in respect to the count of conviction.  See United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1989).  A fortiori, the case for permitting judges free rein to make whatever findings the record can support is airtight where, as here, trial on the disputed counts ends with a hung jury rather than an acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellant presents himself as a babe in the woods, an uneducated carpenter in the company of sophisticated entrepreneurs.  For what this jeremiad may be worth insofar as it bears upon accomplice attribution, it was tendered to, and rejected by, the district judge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  We discern no clear error.  See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990) (acknowledging that \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and relatedly, appellant harps on the fact that Zsofka and Horn called the tune, to which he merely danced.  But the concepts of \"relevant conduct\" and \"role\" are distinct in the world of the sentencing guidelines.  See United States v. Lilly, 13 F.3d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir.1994).  Whereas the former helps to gauge the gravity of an offense, the latter helps to measure the offender's culpability.  See id.   Hence, the district court's attribution of the entire loss to appellant is not in any way inconsistent with the fact that he may have played only a supporting role.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The short of it is that none of the factors upon which appellant dwells cast doubt upon the district court's ascertainment of the amount of loss attributable to appellant in connection with the jointly undertaken criminal activity.  Consequently, we cannot say that the lower court erred in constructing the sentencing calculus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because the case sub judice involves a sentence imposed under the June 15, 1988 edition of the sentencing guidelines, see infra Part II, all references herein are to that edition unless otherwise noted.  Nonetheless, the reasoning and method of analysis that we propose for handling accomplice attribution in the relevant conduct context are fully applicable to the current version of the controlling guideline, U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (Nov.1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The 24 specific offense counts have since been dismissed on motion of the prosecution</p>\n        <p>3 U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1) has always encompassed both acts performed personally by a defendant and acts of others attributable to that defendant as relevant conduct.  The barebones 1988 version, applied by the court below, treated these two types of relevant conduct in separate clauses of the same provision, defining relevant conduct as \"all acts and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable....\"  In the most recent version of the guidelines, the taxonomy is elaborated at greater length, and the two types of relevant conduct are treated in separate provisions, namely, Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) and Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  The category designed to include the first type of relevant conduct--the defendant's own acts--has been rephrased to make clear that it includes \"all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant.\"   We need not dwell on this linguistic change, since the acts committed personally by LaCroix constitute relevant conduct under any conceivable interpretation of the guidelines, past or present.  However, the Commission's clarification of the second category of relevant conduct--the acts of others attributable to the defendant--is significant to the task at hand, and, therefore, we discuss it at some length, see infra note 4 &amp; accompanying text.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Sentencing Commission amended U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1) in 1989 and again in 1992.  See U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 78 &amp; 439 (Nov.1993);  see also Collado, 975 F.2d at 991-92 (analyzing 1989 amendment);  United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1023 n. 6, 1024 nn. 8-9, 1025 n. 10 (1st Cir.1992) (discussing both amendments).  Because the Sentencing Commission has labelled these amendments as \"clarifying\" in nature, rather than as revisionary, they may be taken into account retrospectively, not only by the sentencing court, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.11(b)(2) (Nov.1993), but also on appeal, see United States v. Valencia-Lucena, 988 F.2d 228, 234 n. 5 (1st Cir.1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We have considered the possibility that the latest reformulation of application note 2, U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3, comment.  (n. 2) (Nov.1993), mandates a compound finding, such that, for \"conduct\" to be \"relevant,\" the accomplice's act would have to be \"in furtherance of activity within the scope of agreement.\"   We reject this refinement for two reasons.  First, the language of the guideline itself refers only to the concepts of \"furtherance\" and \"foreseeability.\"   Second, application note 2, read as a whole, appears to use \"in furtherance\" and \"within the scope\" interchangeably--a practice consistent with earlier usage in both the commentary and the case law.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3, comment.  (n. 1) (Nov.1991) (stating, within the space of a few lines, that conduct for which a defendant would be otherwise accountable includes conduct of others \"in furtherance of the execution of the jointly undertaken criminal activity that was reasonably foreseeable\" and excludes conduct that was \"neither within the scope of the defendant's agreement nor was reasonably foreseeable\");  United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 15-16 (1st Cir.1992) (similar);  see generally Paul J. Hofer, Implications of the Relevant Conduct Study for the Revised Guideline, 4 Fed.Sent.R. 334, 335 (1992) (discussing confusion of the terms \"furtherance\" and \"scope\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that the O'Campo court did not say that awareness of pre-entry acts was bereft of evidentiary significance in determining the foreseeability of post-entry acts.  The court said the opposite.  See O'Campo, 973 F.2d at 1026 (stating that \"knowledge of ... prior acts will inform the judgment about what [defendant] reasonably could have foreseen\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In Balogun, we mused that there might be a possible exception to this rule in the rare case where foreseeability is \"inherent in the nature\" of a particular conspiracy.  989 F.2d at 22.   We have yet to probe the parameters of this possible exception, nor do we need to do so today.  We note only that the district court's seemingly misplaced allusion to Balogun's \"inherent in the nature\" language, see supra at p. 228, does little to shed light upon the court's conclusions.  Consequently, we rely on the district judge's individualized findings in respect to foreseeability, and treat his comment that foreseeability \"is really inherent in the nature of [a marketing] conspiracy\" as mere surplusage</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In our view, this is an especially potent case for such attribution.  Above and beyond what the government had to prove in respect to that issue, appellant could easily have foreseen that the coconspirators' method of operation carried with it a heightened chance of default and foreclosure.  Thus, appellant could foresee the consequences of the illegal marketing scheme and the magnitude of the attendant financial risks to which the bedeviled mortgage lender might fall prey</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that the judge sentenced appellant at the lowest point in the GSR, a determination that, to some extent, may have taken into account appellant's supposed lack of sophistication</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Of course, the guidelines permit a sentencing court to reduce a defendant's offense level for \"minor\" or \"minimal\" participation in the offense of conviction.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2.  Appellant did not seek such an adjustment below and, therefore, cannot challenge the lack of such an adjustment on appeal.  See United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that sentencing arguments not seasonably advanced below cannot be introduced for the first time on appeal).  At any rate, while others may have been the ringleaders, we see no basis for characterizing appellant's role as \"minor\" or \"minimal.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (Nov.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We seize the opportunity and, in the end, affirm the sentence imposed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For many years, defendant-appellant Evangelist LaCroix earned his livelihood as a building subcontractor in southern New Hampshire.  He became acquainted with the brothers Zsofka, Matthew and Lazlos, who, through entities known as ZLM Realty and 101 Realty (the Zsofka entities), planned to develop a sizable single-family residential real estate complex known as \"Sunview II.\"   In late 1985, appellant and Matthew Zsofka (Zsofka), together with Zsofka's construction foreman, John Lee, formed a corporation, Alpha Construction Company, to serve as the general contractor for Sunview II.  Appellant became Alpha's president, though by all accounts Zsofka retained ultimate control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construction and sales proceeded apace until the summer of 1987, when demand began to slacken.  Alpha responded to adversity by retaining a marketing agent, Horns of New Hampshire (HNH), a firm headed by Richard Horn.  Zsofka and Horn masterminded an illegal scheme that enabled their companies to market and sell roughly 90 homes over the following two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspirators' plan was seductively simple:  they secretly gave money, secured by a late-filed second mortgage, to any would-be homeowner who lacked the wherewithal for the minimum down payment required by the prospective purchase-money mortgage lender (usually the Dime Savings Bank).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant personally handled 31 closings at which he falsely represented, both orally and in writing, that no undisclosed financing arrangements existed.  Appellant knew these statements to be apocryphal when made.  The other 60-odd closings were handled in much the same fashion by one or the other of appellant's coconspirators.  The transactions were structured in such a way that, on paper, Alpha conveyed the houses, but not the land, to the buyers.  The company received in excess of $37,000 at every closing.  These proceeds enabled Alpha, among other things, to assist the Zsofka entities in funding the clandestine second mortgages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Zsofka and Horn hatched the plot, appellant attended weekly staff meetings at which all the closings, including those handled by others, were discussed and approved.  At no fewer than three of these meetings Zsofka preached to those present, appellant among them, about the importance of keeping all secondary financing hidden from the first mortgagees.  Zsofka also gave instructions on how best to accomplish this furtive feat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the under-three-year period when the scheme was velivolant, appellant drew a total of approximately $385,000 in salary from Alpha.  In sum, as a part-owner and salaried officer of Alpha, appellant participated in, or was present at the discussion of, every transaction, profited at least indirectly from each sale, and stood to gain more money later (when and if the buyers repaid the second mortgages).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over time, many of the borrowers proved unable to pay the first mortgages, resulting in widespread foreclosures at a net cost to the Dime Savings Bank in excess of $2,800,000.  Losses of this magnitude are seldom unremarked.  In 1992, a federal grand jury returned a 102-count indictment against the three Alpha principals and four persons associated with HNH.  The indictment charged appellant with conspiracy to defraud a federally insured financial institution in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, and with various substantive offenses, including 12 counts of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344, and 12 counts of making false statements to a federally insured financial institution, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.  After a 17-day trial, the jury announced its inability to reach agreement on the 24 counts charging appellant with the commission of substantive offenses,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but nevertheless found him guilty of conspiring to defraud the Dime Savings Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. SENTENCING AND ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1993, the trial judge convened a disposition hearing.  Apparently fearing potential ex post facto problems, the judge, without objection, consulted the sentencing guidelines that had been in effect at the time the conspiracy wound down, namely, the June 15, 1988 edition.  See United States v. Harotunian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that a sentencing court should apply the guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing unless doing so will implicate ex post facto concerns);  United States v. Arboleda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558577\"><a href=\"/opinion/558577/united-states-v-carlos-arboleda-united-states-v-martin-castillo-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span>, 871 (1st Cir.1991) (stating that, if the guidelines in effect at sentencing are not used, then members of a conspiracy are ordinarily \"subject to the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of the completion of the conspiracy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with a base offense level of six, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(a), the judge added ten levels on the theory that appellant shared responsibility for inflicting losses of at least $2,000,000 (but less than $5,000,000), see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1)(K), and then added two incremental levels for more than minimal planning, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2)(A).  These calculations yielded an adjusted offense level of 18, which, for a first offender, produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 27-33 months.  The court imposed an incarcerative sentence at the nadir of the range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal spotlights the court's determination of the aggregate losses properly attributable to LaCroix.  Noting that the judge counted transactions handled by his coconspirators as \"relevant conduct\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1), and, therefore, tagged him with the entire loss suffered by the defrauded bank, LaCroix assigns error.  He contends that the sentencing court misconceived the applicable test for relevant conduct, mounted too shallow an inquiry into the subject, and, in all events, that the court found the facts in a quixotic manner, thereby misapplying the test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's first contention poses a question of guideline interpretation, which sparks de novo review.  See United States v. DeLuca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195223\"><a href=\"/opinion/195223/united-states-v-deluca/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that, when \"an appeal raises a purely legal question involving the proper interpretation of the sentencing guideline, appellate review is plenary\");  United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701 (1st Cir.1992) (similar).  Appellant's second contention also poses a pure question of law and is, therefore, to be reviewed under the same standard.  Appellant's third contention is cut from different cloth;  it hinges on a factbound determination under the applicable guideline, thus evoking clear error review.  See United States v. Bradley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 605 (1st Cir.1990);  see also United States v.

FORMULATING THE RELEVANT CONDUCT INQUIRY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond serious question that the losses stemming from the 31 transactions closed by appellant constitute relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1).<sup>3</sup>  Less obvious is whether the remaining transactions, approximately 60 in number, closed by coconspirators, may be attributed to him.  This appeal centers around appellant's insistence that the court below misinterpreted the test governing what the Third Circuit aptly has called \"accomplice attribution,\" see United States v. Collado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591135\"><a href=\"/opinion/591135/united-states-v-policai-collado-aka-poli-jorge-collado-in-91-1492/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 990 (3d Cir.1992), by taking too permissive a view of the test's foreseeability prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A.

Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (Nov.1993).  Reading the 1988 version of section 1B1.3(a)(1) in light of subsequent clarifying amendments to both the guideline and its commentary, we understand the Sentencing Commission to have mandated a two-part inquiry for accomplice attribution in the relevant conduct milieu.  First, the sentencing court must determine what acts and omissions of others were in furtherance of the defendant's jointly undertaken criminal activity.  This task requires the court to ascertain what activity fell within the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant's agreement (whether explicit or tacit).  Second, the court must determine to what extent others' acts and omissions that were in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity likely would have been foreseeable by a reasonable person in defendant's shoes at the time of his or her agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is important to emphasize that the vantage point for the foreseeability judgment is the time of the defendant's agreement--not necessarily the time he personally undertook the performance of criminal activity, or the time of his entry into the conspiracy.  Siting the vantage point in this way has at least two salient implications.  For one thing, a court examining relevant conduct may attribute to a defendant acts committed by his accomplices prior to the commission of his own acts, so long as they occur subsequent to his agreement.  For another thing, because a single defendant may make multiple agreements or expand an existing agreement, a defendant sometimes may be chargeable with losses arising out of conduct that he could not have foreseen at the time he entered the conspiracy, so long as such conduct was foreseeable at the time that he signaled his agreement to the expanded scope of jointly undertaken criminal activity embracing such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the inquiry may be truncated.  There has never been any suggestion that the 60-something transactions closed by appellant's coconspirators were outside the scope of appellant's agreement, or, put another way, that those transactions were other than in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.  Consequently, this appeal turns exclusively on the issue of foreseeability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>B. The Findings Below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, defense counsel argued that appellant could not have foreseen the conduct of others.  The lower court treated this argument as calling into question an application of the guidelines.  The court then proceeded to find, based on the trial evidence and the jury verdict, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Lacroix was involved in this conspiracy from the beginning.  He was aware of the nature and extent of the development that was involved, the development that Alpha was involved in.  He was aware of the cost of the homes.  He was aware of the profit that was being received, and he was also receiving salaries from Alpha, $173,000 in '87, $187,000 in '88, $25,000 in '89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So in the opinion of the Court he was well aware of the magnitude of what was happening here, and ... under all of the circumstances in which he was involved, the foreseeability in this situation is really inherent in the nature of the conspiracy that was involved here, which was a marketing conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant says that the district court's findings on foreseeability are flawed both legally and factually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>A. Questions of Law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant raises two predominantly legal challenges to the court's formulation of the relevant conduct inquiry.  We inspect each challenge in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Mere Awareness.   Appellant seizes on the district court's repeated use of the word \"aware\" and suggests that its recurrence betokens a single-minded focus on the defendant's knowledge.  This focus is impermissible, appellant asseverates, because a finding of \"mere awareness,\" in and of itself, cannot be equated with, and does not justify, a finding of foreseeability in the sentencing phase.  Despite appellant's citations to several cases, his asseveration begs the pivotal question.  Awareness does not always bear on foreseeability in precisely (or even roughly) the same way.  To understand the inferences that lawfully can be drawn from awareness in any given situation, a court must first assess the particular factual setting and then answer the question:  \"Awareness of what?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The four cases upon which appellant principally relies, read carefully, underscore this necessity.  The first of them, United States v. O'Campo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589965\"><a href=\"/opinion/589965/united-states-v-claudia-ocampo-united-states-v-julian-redeondo/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span>, is a case in which we admonished sentencing judges not to equate mere knowledge with foreseeability--but we were referring specifically to \"mere knowledge of historic facts.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589965\"><a href=\"/opinion/589965/united-states-v-claudia-ocampo-united-states-v-julian-redeondo/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1025. </a></span>  By this, we meant that the foreseeability of acts performed after defendant's entry into a conspiracy could not be established by his \"mere knowledge\" of acts performed prior to his entry into the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589965\"><a href=\"/opinion/589965/united-states-v-claudia-ocampo-united-states-v-julian-redeondo/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1026; </a></span> see also United States v. Carreon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658790\"><a href=\"/opinion/658790/united-states-v-octavio-carreon-and-armando-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1225</span></a></span>, 1234-37 (5th Cir.1994) (discussing O'Campo ).   Since LaCroix was involved in the instant conspiracy from the start, the stratagemical acts of which he was aware necessarily occurred after his entry into the conspiracy.  Thus, O'Campo is inapposite because it did not deal with post-entry acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining three cases upon which appellant relies advance the bland proposition that foreseeability is not dispositively established by mere awareness of the existence or illegality of a conspiracy.   See United States v. Evbuomwan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605620\"><a href=\"/opinion/605620/united-states-v-joe-evbuomwan/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 74 (5th Cir.1993) (explaining that \"mere knowledge that criminal activity is taking place is not enough\");  United States v. Valencia-Lucena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602341\"><a href=\"/opinion/602341/united-states-v-carlos-valencia-lucena-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 234 (1st Cir.1993) (suggesting that individuals may \"know that the agreement they have entered is illegal but [nevertheless] have no way to foresee the magnitude or ambition of the enterprise\");  United States v. Edwards, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569213\"><a href=\"/opinion/569213/united-states-v-jackie-edwards-leda-martin-olanrewaju-raji-andre/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1387</span></a></span>, 1393 (7th Cir.1991) (commenting that \"foreseeability means more than subjective awareness ... that [an accomplice] headed a long-standing and successful heroin distribution network\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1590</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span> </span>(1992).  We find no fault with these cases--but we caution that the courts' words cannot be read in a vacuum.  Awareness, even if limited to knowledge of a conspiracy's unlawfulness, is always (or almost always) relevant to the question of foreseeability--and none of the cited cases suggest the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, these three cases do not in any way denigrate the possibility that foreseeability may be established by a different kind of awareness, that is, by a defendant's knowledge of the nature and extent of a conspiracy in which he is involved.   This, of course, is exactly the stripe of awareness detected by the court below.  It is both good law and good logic that a defendant's awareness of the inner workings of a conspiracy in which he is participating is germane to, and often highly probative of, accomplice attribution.  Although appellant may choose to characterize such intimate knowledge as \"mere awareness\"--a term that we view as verging on the oxymoronic in a case like this one--he is fishing in an empty stream.  Such knowledge frequently will suffice to prove the defendant's ability to foresee the acts of coconspirators.  See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660721\"><a href=\"/opinion/660721/united-states-v-lee-w-roberts-also-known-as-kurlee-roberts-also-known/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 525 (10th Cir.1993) (concluding that a defendant's knowledge that the accomplice habitually carried a firearm justified a finding that defendant could reasonably foresee that accomplice would carry the gun on the occasion in question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Foreseeability\" is conventionally defined as the \"ability to see or know in advance.\"   Black's Law Dictionary 649 (6th ed. 1990).  Viewed in that light, a \"reasonably foreseeable act\" might well be regarded as an act that a reasonable person who knew everything that the defendant knew at the time would have been able to know in advance with a fair degree of probability.  Giving due weight to the intimate connection between knowledge and foreseeability, we conclude that in this case it was both permissible and advisable for the district court to consider appellant's awareness of the conspiracy's nature and scope en route to an ultimate determination on foreseeability.  The district court, therefore, did not misconstrue either the elements of the accomplice attribution test or the way in which the test should operate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Nature of the Inquiry.   Appellant's next argument is pitched in a somewhat different direction.  He points to a Third Circuit directive that instructs district courts, when considering accomplice attribution in the relevant conduct context, to embark upon \"a searching and individualized inquiry into the circumstances surrounding each defendant's involvement in the conspiracy.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591135\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Collado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/591135/united-states-v-policai-collado-aka-poli-jorge-collado-in-91-1492/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span>.   He then invites us to adopt this standard and calumnizes the district court for mounting an inquiry that supposedly fell short of it.  We believe that this argument is largely an exercise in semantics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the invitation that appellant extends is wholly gratuitous.  We already have endorsed the principle of a searching and individualized inquiry in the relevant conduct context.  See, e.g., United States v. Balogun, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602831\"><a href=\"/opinion/602831/united-states-v-henry-olawale-balogun-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that a sentencing court ordinarily must make specific, individualized findings regarding foreseeability for each defendant).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Indeed, the Third Circuit, in constructing the rule appellant urges us to \"adopt,\" cites our opinion in United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576213\"><a href=\"/opinion/576213/united-states-v-hector-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1992), as a model.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591135\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Collado,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/591135/united-states-v-policai-collado-aka-poli-jorge-collado-in-91-1492/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span>.   The mere fact that we have employed slightly different phraseology than the Third Circuit is of no consequence.  The adjectives used in Collado, while concinnous, are neither talismans nor words of art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second half of appellant's argument is equally meritless.  Here, the district court honored the spirit of Balogun by making extensive findings regarding the foreseeability of others' acts from appellant's vantage point.  Since the court presided over a 17-day trial and based its findings, inter alia, \"on all of the evidence that the Court heard during the course of the trial,\" it strains credulity to describe the inquiry below as insufficiently searching.  We are hard pressed to imagine what more the district court might have done--and appellant, for all his lamentations, has not advanced a single concrete suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>B. Questions of Fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's fallback position is that, even if the district court applied the proper legal rules in determining relevant conduct, its findings of fact were clearly erroneous.  The facts of the case, taken without embellishment, expose the fallacy in appellant's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, LaCroix was neither the progenitor nor the moving spirit of the conspiracy, but he helped to found it, retained a proprietary interest in it, and played an integral part in its operation.  Moreover, he served as the titular head of the firm that oversaw the construction, marketing, financing, and sale of every home.  The record supports--indeed, virtually compels--an inference that appellant understood from the inception that the object of the conspiracy was to sell homes by hook or by crook.  Taking the district court's explicit findings, and fleshing them out with details derived from the record, we understand the court to have concluded that appellant knew all along the sums involved in each transaction and the conspiracy's method of operation--selling houses to unqualified buyers by providing, and then fraudulently concealing, secondary financing.  Because any reasonable person in appellant's position, at the time of his agreement, would have recognized that ninety or more homes might be sold in this corrupt fashion, the court below did not err in concluding that all the losses resulting from the sales were fairly attributable to LaCroix.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant cannot deny this analysis in any of its particulars, and, in fairness, does not really try to do so.  Instead, he seeks to escape the force of the district court's reasoning by introducing three extraneous considerations.  At bottom, this endeavor reflects a basic misunderstanding of sentencing principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, appellant insists that a finding of foreseeability is undermined by the jury verdict.  We do not agree.  The jury did not exonerate appellant in connection with the substantive offense counts;  rather, it simply deadlocked on these counts.  Its verdict, therefore, did not resolve the contested issues either way, but left them up in the air.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the method of the guidelines is to leave to the sentencing judge, not the jury, the determination of what \"conduct\" is \"relevant\" to the fashioning of a defendant's sentence.  See United States v. Limberopoulos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195427\"><a href=\"/opinion/195427/united-states-v-limberopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span>, 251-52 (1st Cir.1994);  see also U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3.  Thus, even a trial jury's refusal to find that a certain fact has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt will not bar the district court from making precisely that same finding at sentencing, under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.  On this basis, we have held squarely that a defendant's acquittal on a particular count does not limit the sentencing court's flexibility in considering the same underlying facts in respect to the count of conviction.  See United States v. Mocciola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533000\"><a href=\"/opinion/533000/united-states-v-gerard-peter-mocciola/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1989).  A fortiori, the case for permitting judges free rein to make whatever findings the record can support is airtight where, as here, trial on the disputed counts ends with a hung jury rather than an acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellant presents himself as a babe in the woods, an uneducated carpenter in the company of sophisticated entrepreneurs.  For what this jeremiad may be worth insofar as it bears upon accomplice attribution, it was tendered to, and rejected by, the district judge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  We discern no clear error.  See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.1990) (acknowledging that \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and relatedly, appellant harps on the fact that Zsofka and Horn called the tune, to which he merely danced.  But the concepts of \"relevant conduct\" and \"role\" are distinct in the world of the sentencing guidelines.  See United States v. Lilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195133\"><a href=\"/opinion/195133/united-states-v-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18-19 (1st Cir.1994).  Whereas the former helps to gauge the gravity of an offense, the latter helps to measure the offender's culpability.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195133\"><a href=\"/opinion/195133/united-states-v-lilly/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   Hence, the </a></span>district court's attribution of the entire loss to appellant is not in any way inconsistent with the fact that he may have played only a supporting role.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The short of it is that none of the factors upon which appellant dwells cast doubt upon the district court's ascertainment of the amount of loss attributable to appellant in connection with the jointly undertaken criminal activity.  Consequently, we cannot say that the lower court erred in constructing the sentencing calculus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because the case sub judice involves a sentence imposed under the June 15, 1988 edition of the sentencing guidelines, see infra Part II, all references herein are to that edition unless otherwise noted.  Nonetheless, the reasoning and method of analysis that we propose for handling accomplice attribution in the relevant conduct context are fully applicable to the current version of the controlling guideline, U.S.S.G.

Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1) has always encompassed both acts performed personally by a defendant and acts of others attributable to that defendant as relevant conduct.  The barebones 1988 version, applied by the court below, treated these two types of relevant conduct in separate clauses of the same provision, defining relevant conduct as \"all acts and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable....\"  In the most recent version of the guidelines, the taxonomy is elaborated at greater length, and the two types of relevant conduct are treated in separate provisions, namely, Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) and Sec. 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  The category designed to include the first type of relevant conduct--the defendant's own acts--has been rephrased to make clear that it includes \"all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant.\"   We need not dwell on this linguistic change, since the acts committed personally by LaCroix constitute relevant conduct under any conceivable interpretation of the guidelines, past or present.  However, the Commission's clarification of the second category of relevant conduct--the acts of others attributable to the defendant--is significant to the task at hand, and, therefore, we discuss it at some length, see infra note 4 &amp; accompanying text.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Sentencing Commission amended U.S.S.G.

First, the language of the guideline itself refers only to the concepts of \"furtherance\" and \"foreseeability.\"   Second, application note 2, read as a whole, appears to use \"in furtherance\" and \"within the scope\" interchangeably--a practice consistent with earlier usage in both the commentary and the case law.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3, comment.  (n. 1) (Nov.1991) (stating, within the space of a few lines, that conduct for which a defendant would be otherwise accountable includes conduct of others \"in furtherance of the execution of the jointly undertaken criminal activity that was reasonably foreseeable\" and excludes conduct that was \"neither within the scope of the defendant's agreement nor was reasonably foreseeable\");  United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576213\"><a href=\"/opinion/576213/united-states-v-hector-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 15-16 (1st Cir.1992) (similar);  see generally Paul J. Hofer, Implications of the Relevant Conduct Study for the Revised Guideline, 4 Fed.Sent.R. 334, 335 (1992) (discussing confusion of the terms \"furtherance\" and \"scope\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that the O'Campo court did not say that awareness of pre-entry acts was bereft of evidentiary significance in determining the foreseeability of post-entry acts.  The court said the opposite.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589965\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">O'Campo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/589965/united-states-v-claudia-ocampo-united-states-v-julian-redeondo/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1026</span> </a></span>(stating that \"knowledge of ... prior acts will inform the judgment about what [defendant] reasonably could have foreseen\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In Balogun, we mused that there might be a possible exception to this rule in the rare case where foreseeability is \"inherent in the nature\" of a particular <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602831\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">conspiracy.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/602831/united-states-v-henry-olawale-balogun-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>.   We have yet to probe the parameters of this possible exception, nor do we need to do so today.  We note only that the district court's seemingly misplaced allusion to Balogun's \"inherent in the nature\" language, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span>at p. 228, does little to shed light upon the court's conclusions.  Consequently, we rely on the district judge's individualized findings in respect to foreseeability, and treat his comment that foreseeability \"is really inherent in the nature of [a marketing] conspiracy\" as mere surplusage</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In our view, this is an especially potent case for such attribution.  Above and beyond what the government had to prove in respect to that issue, appellant could easily have foreseen that the coconspirators' method of operation carried with it a heightened chance of default and foreclosure.  Thus, appellant could foresee the consequences of the illegal marketing scheme and the magnitude of the attendant financial risks to which the bedeviled mortgage lender might fall prey</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that the judge sentenced appellant at the lowest point in the GSR, a determination that, to some extent, may have taken into account appellant's supposed lack of sophistication</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Of course, the guidelines permit a sentencing court to reduce a defendant's offense level for \"minor\" or \"minimal\" participation in the offense of conviction.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.2.  Appellant did not seek such an adjustment below and, therefore, cannot challenge the lack of such an adjustment on appeal.  See United States v. Dietz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that sentencing arguments not seasonably advanced below cannot be introduced for the first time on appeal).  At any rate, while others may have been the ringleaders, we see no basis for characterizing appellant's role as \"minor\" or \"minimal.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
