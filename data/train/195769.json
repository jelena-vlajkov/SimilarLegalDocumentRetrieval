Claimant  Yuri Rothman seeks  to challenge\r                           \n\nvarious    administrative   determinations    regarding   his\n\nentitlement to  Social Security disability  benefits.   Given\n\nthe cryptic  nature of  his  submissions, both  below and  on\n\nappeal,  the  precise issues  being  raised  are not  readily\n\ndecipherable.   To  the  extent claimant  is challenging  the\n\nfinding,  reached by the Administrative  Law Judge (ALJ) in a\n\n1990 decision,  that  he was  not disabled  between 1979  and\n\n1984,  this   claim  was  properly  dismissed   for  lack  of\n\njurisdiction.   The  Appeals  Council rejected  his  untimely\n\nrequest for review  of the ALJ's decision after  finding that\n\nhe had failed to establish the requisite good cause.   As has\n\nbeen  widely held, such a dismissal is not a \"final decision\"\n\nfor  the purposes  of  42 U.S.C.    405(g)  and  thus is  not\n\nreviewable  in federal court.  See,  e.g., Bacon v. Sullivan,\r                                                                        \n\n969 F.2d 1517, 1519-21 (3d Cir. 1992) (citing cases).\n\n     To the extent claimant  is challenging the ALJ's finding\n\nthat  he  was   ineligible  for  disability   benefits  after\n\nSeptember 1984 due to  the earlier expiration of  his insured\n\nstatus,  his  claim was  subject  to  dismissal  on the  same\n\nground.   The district  court, in  dismissing this  claim for\n\nlack of jurisdiction, did so without prejudice--apparently in\n\nthe belief that it was  the subject of pending administrative\n\naction.  The record reveals, however, that the  ALJ addressed\n\nthis matter in his  1990 decision.  Since the  government has\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nnot expressed any concern on the point, we leave the judgment\n\nas  it stands  and mention  the matter  only for  purposes of\n\nclarity.\n\n     Finally, claimant challenges  the determination that  he\n\nreceived,  and  was  obligated  to  repay,  some  $24,000  in\n\nbenefits that were \"overpaid.\"  To the extent he is disputing\n\nthe  existence and  amount  of such  overpayment, this  claim\n\narguably was subject to dismissal with prejudice as well; the\n\nrecord  reveals that  the ALJ  addressed these matters  in an\n\nintervening 1993 decision from which claimant filed no appeal\n\n(a  decision which  neither party  apparently brought  to the\n\nattention  of the district court).   In any  event, given the\n\nSecretary's  recent  decision  to  waive  repayment  of  such\n\nbenefits, this matter is now moot.\n\n     The  judgment is  affirmed.   The  motion to  supplement\r                                                                         \n\nrecord is allowed.\r                              \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
