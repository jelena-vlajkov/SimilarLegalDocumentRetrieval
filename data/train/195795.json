Plaintiffs Andrew and Priscilla  Tempelman\r                           \n\nare long-time tax protesters--proponents of the view that the\n\nUnited States internal  revenue system is invalid.   In 1992,\n\nbased upon  audits of plaintiffs' returns for  the years 1986\n\nthrough 1988,  the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined,\n\ninter  alia,  that  various deductions  had  been  improperly\r                       \n\nclaimed  and that  additional  taxes were  owed.   Plaintiffs\n\nsuccessfully  challenged  this  determination  in  tax court,\n\nwhere a settlement with  the IRS resulted in the  elimination\n\nof  most or  all  of such  liability.   They  then  filed the\n\ninstant  pro se action  in state court,  seeking damages from\n\nthe  IRS agent  who  had conducted  the  audits.   Plaintiffs\n\ncharged  that  defendant  had  deliberately  and  maliciously\n\nimposed  further tax  liabilities  in  retaliation for  their\n\ndissident  views,  in  violation  of  various  statutory  and\n\nconstitutional provisions.\n\n     Defendant removed  the action to federal  court and then\n\nmoved to dismiss, claiming  that parts of the complaint  were\n\njurisdictionally defective  while other parts failed to state\n\na  claim.   In a  comprehensive  opinion, the  district court\n\nagreed  and dismissed  the complaint  under Fed.  R. Civ.  P.\n\n12(b)(1) &amp;  (6).  The court  went on to find  that plaintiffs\n\nwere engaged  in a \"vendetta\"  against the IRS,  having filed\n\nnumerous frivolous cases against the agency and its employees\n\nsolely for the purpose of harassment.  As a result, the court\r\r\n\nenjoined  plaintiffs  from filing  any  further  such actions\n\nwithout   judicial  approval.     It  also  imposed  monetary\n\nsanctions.  Plaintiffs, in summary fashion, challenge each of\n\nthese rulings on appeal.1\n\n                              I.\n\n     We  need  not  linger  long  over  the  merits   of  the\n\ncomplaint.  Plaintiffs have relied on a plethora of statutory\n\nprovisions  in  an attempt  to establish  jurisdiction and/or\n\nstate a claim.   Each  proves unavailing.   For example,  two\n\ncriminal  provisions on  which they  rely--18 U.S.C.     241,\n\n242--do not  give rise to a  civil action for damages.   See,\r                                                                        \n\ne.g.,  Rodi  v. Ventetuolo,  941 F.2d  22,  29 n.8  (1st Cir.\r                                      \n\n1991); Cok v. Cosentino, 876  F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.  1989) (per\r                                   \n\ncuriam).   A third such  provision, contained in  26 U.S.C.  \n\n7214, is  likewise inapposite; \"a precondition  to a taxpayer\n\nsuit for damages against a revenue agent under this provision\n\nis  the  criminal  conviction  of  the  agent.\"   Hollett  v.\r                                                                     \n\nBrowning,  711 F.  Supp.  1009, 1012  n.2  (E.D. Cal.  1988).\r                    \n\nPlaintiffs' reliance on  42 U.S.C.     1983, 1985 (and  their\n\njurisdictional counterpart,  28 U.S.C.   1343)  is misplaced.\n\nSection 1983 is inapplicable to federal officials not alleged\n\nto  have  acted  \"under color  of  state  law.\"   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nDistrict of Columbia v. Carter,  409 U.S. 418, 424-25 (1973);\r                                          \n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  Given  the disposition  we  reach, there  is  no need  to\ndecide whether  the notice  of appeal was  ineffective as  to\nPriscilla Tempelman, as defendant suggests. \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nSoldevilla v. Secretary  of Agric.,  512 F.2d  427, 429  (1st\r                                              \n\nCir.  1975).   In turn,  as the  district court  discussed at\n\nlength, plaintiffs  have not  come close  to stating  a claim\n\nunder   1985.\n\n     No more helpful is plaintiffs' invocation of the Federal\n\nTort  Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.     1346(b), 2671-80.  Explicitly\n\nexcluded from  the FTCA's  ambit is  \"[a]ny claim arising  in\n\nrespect  of the assessment or collection of  any tax.\"  Id.  \r                                                                       \n\n2680(c);  see,  e.g.,  McMillen  v. United  States  Dep't  of\r                                                                         \n\nTreasury, 960 F.2d  187, 188  (1st Cir.  1991) (per  curiam).\r                    \n\nContrary to plaintiffs' contention, the allegations here fall\n\nreadily within this exception.  See, e.g., National Commodity\r                                                                         \n\nand Barter Ass'n  v. Gibbs,  886 F.2d 1240,  1246 (10th  Cir.\r                                      \n\n1989); Capozzoli v. Tracey, 663 F.2d 654, 658 (5th Cir. 1981)\r                                      \n\n(  2680(c) has been \"interpreted broadly\" to cover activities\n\nthat were \"in any  way related to the [IRS]  agents' official\n\nduties\").  \n\n     Plaintiffs' reliance on 26  U.S.C.   7433(a) also proves\n\nmisplaced.   This  provision  authorizes a  civil action  for\n\ndamages whenever an IRS official \"recklessly or intentionally\n\ndisregards\" the tax laws  in connection with \"any collection\"\n\nof federal taxes.  Yet plaintiffs are complaining of  alleged\n\nmisconduct  that occurred in  connection with the calculation\n\nof  their  tax liability,  rather  than  with the  collection\n\nthereof.  Such a claim is not cognizable under    7433.  See,\r                                                                        \n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ne.g., Shaw v.  United States,  20 F.3d 182,  184 (5th  Cir.),\r                                        \n\ncert.  denied, 63 U.S.L.W. 3181 (1994); Gonsalves v. IRS, 975\r                                                                    \n\nF.2d 13, 16  (1st Cir.  1992) (per curiam).   Furthermore,  a\n\nprerequisite to any such action is that the taxpayer  exhaust\n\nhis  or   her  administrative  remedies,  see   26  U.S.C.   \r                                                         \n\n7433(d)(1),  by filing  a written  administrative claim  with\n\n\"the  district  director ...  of  the district  in  which the\n\ntaxpayer  currently resides,\"  26 C.F.R.    301.7433-1(e)(1).\n\nThere  is no  suggestion that  plaintiffs have  complied with\n\nthis requirement.  The failure to do so deprives the court of\n\njurisdiction.   See, e.g.,  Venen v. United  States,     F.3d\r                                                               \n\n   , 1994 WL  567016, at  *2-*3 (3d Cir.  1994); Conforte  v.\r                                                                     \n\nUnited States, 979 F.2d 1375, 1377 (9th Cir. 1992).\r                         \n\n     Finally,  plaintiffs have  sought  to  advance a  Bivens\r                                                                         \n\nclaim against defendant in her personal capacity.  See Bivens\r                                                                         \n\nv.  Six Unknown Named Agents  of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,\r                                                                        \n\n403  U.S.  388 (1971).   In  this  regard, they  contend that\n\ndefendant's  actions abridged  their rights under  the First,\n\nFourth,  Fifth, Eighth  and Fourteenth  Amendments.   Because\n\nplaintiffs  on  appeal  have  mentioned  the  point  only  in\n\npassing,  it suffices to note the following.  As we explained\n\nin McMillen,  courts have  been disinclined to  create Bivens\r                                                                         \n\nremedies  in the  internal revenue  context in  light of  the\n\n\"remedial  mechanisms  for  constitutional  violations\"  that\n\nCongress has already implemented  in this area.  960  F.2d at\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n190-91  (quoting Schweiker  v.

In particular,  courts have specifically disavowed\n\nany Bivens remedy for  alleged violations associated with tax\r                      \n\nassessment and  collection activities.

The Tenth  Circuit's pair of opinions  in Gibbs\r                                                                         \n\n(\"NCBA  I\"), 886 F.2d 1240, and National Commodity and Barter\r                                                                         \n\nAss'n  v.

With respect\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.  In  their district  court pleadings,  plaintiffs conceded\nthat  their  Eighth Amendment  claim  was without  merit.   A\nsimilar conclusion  applies as to their  Fourteenth Amendment\nclaim.  In turn, we have difficulty perceiving how the Fourth\nAmendment is implicated by plaintiffs' allegations.  \n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nto  allegations that  IRS  agents had  engaged in  widespread\n\nmisconduct  with respect  to a  tax-protesting organization--\n\nincluding repeated raids of its headquarters and its members'\n\nhomes and seizures of membership records--the court held that\n\na Bivens claim  had been  stated under the  First and  Fourth\r                    \n\nAmendments.  See  NCBA I, 886 F.2d at 1248;  NCBA II, 31 F.3d\r                                                                \n\nat 1527-32.   However, with respect  to allegations that  the\n\nIRS had effected  \"wrongful jeopardy assessments,\" the  court\n\ndeclined  to recognize  a  First or  Fourth Amendment  Bivens\r                                                                         \n\nremedy \"[i]n light of the remedies  afforded elsewhere.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \n\nat 1532.  So here, we think the panoply of statutory remedies\n\navailable militates against recognition  of a First or Fourth\n\nAmendment  Bivens   remedy  with  respect  to   the  wrongful\r                             \n\nassessment of plaintiffs' tax liability.3\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  Plaintiffs also  allege that  their  suit was  improperly\nremoved to  federal court.

Morgan, 395 U.S. 402, 409 (1969); accord, e.g.,\r                                                                        \nPalermo  v.   Rorex,  806  F.2d  1266,   1269-70  (5th  Cir.)\r                               \n(rejecting argument that  defendants were  not acting  \"under\ncolor  of federal office\" because their  acts were alleged to\nhave been maliciously motivated),  cert. denied, 484 U.S. 819\r                                                           \n(1987);  see also  Arizona v.

As  such,\nplaintiffs'  inability to subpoena the United States Attorney\nin  order to examine the validity of  his 28 U.S.C.   2679(d)\ncertification--about  which  they also  complain--was without\nconsequence. \n     As  well,  plaintiffs  object that  the  district  judge\nrecused himself on the  same day that he denied  their motion\nfor  reconsideration.   To the  contrary, the  record reveals\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n                             II.\n\n     Remaining for  consideration  is the  propriety  of  the\n\nsanctions   imposed  upon   plaintiffs--as   to  which   some\n\nadditional  background  is necessary.    In  response to  the\n\ndistrict  court's order  of  dismissal,  plaintiffs  filed  a\n\nmotion for reconsideration.  Displaying a lack of familiarity\n\nwith the  sovereign immunity doctrine, they  there castigated\n\nthe  court  for  leaving  them  with  \"no remedy\"  in  \"clear\n\ndefiance  of and  contempt  for  federal  law.\"    They  then\n\nproceeded, in increasingly intemperate language, to warn  the\n\ndistrict judge  that unless  the dismissal were  rescinded he\n\nwould \"stand  liable\" for possible  constitutional violations\n\nand would run the risk  of impeachment and of being  named as\n\n\"a co-conspirator in  a far larger Civil  Rights matter which\n\nis  coming  before  this  court  in  a  series  of  actions.\"\n\nAccording  to their certificate  of service,  plaintiffs sent\n\ncopies of  this  motion to  some 28  political officials  and\n\nvarious media outlets. \n\n     The  district  judge held  a hearing  on the  motion, at\n\nwhich plaintiffs enumerated at some length (and in reasonably\n\ndecorous fashion) their objections to the order of dismissal.\n\nThe  court   thereafter,  in  an  oral   ruling,  voiced  its\n\n                    \r                                \n\nthat plaintiffs' motion for recusal was  denied on that date.\nWe are told that the judge subsequently recused  himself from\nother  cases  involving  plaintiffs--an  action  that  has no\nbearing on the instant matter.  \n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\ndisapproval of plaintiffs' conduct.   Their veiled suggestion\n\nthat  the court had  conspired with the  government, it held,\n\nbordered on  \"criminal contempt.\"   Their treatment  of court\n\npersonnel had  been \"insulting\" and \"bully[ing].\"   And their\n\n\"vendetta against the IRS and its employees\"--pursued through\n\na series  of \"frivolous\" and \"harassing\"  lawsuits--had \"gone\n\non  too long.\"  Accordingly,  the court entered  a sua sponte\r                                                                         \n\norder enjoining plaintiffs from filing any further actions in\n\nthe District  of New  Hampshire \"against the  IRS,\" including\n\nsuits removable from state court, without judicial  approval.\n\nIt also imposed sanctions in the amount of $293 (representing\n\nthe travel costs incurred by government counsel to attend the\n\nhearing).  In a  subsequent written order in support  of this\n\nruling,  the court  noted that  the instant  case was  one of\n\neleven  actions  that   plaintiffs  had  prosecuted  in   New\n\nHampshire federal court  since 1986, ten  of which the  court\n\nfound  had involved  the  IRS  or  its  agents.    The  court\n\nreiterated its injunction as follows:\n\n          The  clerk of  this  court is  ordered not  to\n     accept any  more  cases from  the plaintiff  unless\n     screened  by a  Judge Magistrate  or Judge  of this\n     court.   If  the  plaintiff by  subterfuge, or  any\n     other means[,]  sues in a state  court knowing that\n     it has  to  be removed  by the  government to  this\n     court, he shall  be subject to immediate  sanctions\n     ....\n\nThe court also there denied the motion for reconsideration.  \n\n     Federal courts, of course, \"possess discretionary powers\n\nto regulate the conduct of abusive litigants.\"  Cok v. Family\r                                                                         \n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nCourt  of Rhode Island, 985 F.2d  32, 34 (1st Cir. 1993) (per\r                                  \n\ncuriam).   Accordingly,  \"in extreme  circumstances involving\n\ngroundless encroachment  upon the limited  time and resources\n\nof the court and other parties, an injunction barring a party\n\nfrom filing and processing  frivolous and vexatious  lawsuits\n\nmay  be appropriate.\"  Castro v. United States, 775 F.2d 399,\r                                                          \n\n408  (1st Cir.  1985)  (per  curiam).    Any  bar  on  future\n\nlitigation must  be \"narrowly tailored\" to  \"fit the specific\n\nvice  encountered.\"  Sires v.  Gabriel, 748 F.2d  49, 51 (1st\r                                                  \n\nCir.  1984) (per curiam).   As we have  explained, if such an\n\ninjunction \"were  couched in  overly broad terms,  this could\n\nimpermissibly infringe upon a  litigator's right of access to\n\nthe  courts.\"  Castro, 775 F.2d at  410.  We review the entry\r                                 \n\nof  such an injunction for  abuse of discretion.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nid. at 408.\r               \n\n     We think  it obvious, under the  circumstances, that the\n\ndistrict  court intended to  restrict the  filing of  any new\n\nactions  against the IRS or  its agents (as  indicated in the\n\noral order), rather than to restrict  court access across the\n\nboard  (as suggested  in  the written  order).   Even  as  so\n\nconstrued,  the  injunction  raises  several  concerns.    An\n\ninitial  problem  is  that  plaintiffs were  not  \"warned  or\n\notherwise   given  notice   that  filing   restrictions  were\n\ncontemplated,\" and thus were  not afforded \"an opportunity to\n\nrespond\" before entry thereof.  Cok, 985 F.2d at 35.  In Cok,\r                                                                        \n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\njust  as in the instant case, the court entered an injunction\n\non a sua sponte  basis at the close of a  motion hearing.  We\r                           \n\nnoted  that where  the plaintiff  had been  deprived of  even\n\n\"informal\" notice--such  as might  be  provided by  way of  a\n\ndefendant's  request for  an  injunction  or  a  magistrate's\n\nrecommendation thereof--the  customary route  was to  issue a\n\nshow cause order or  a \"cautionary\" edict.   Id.  Nothing  of\r                                                            \n\nthe sort occurred here.4\n\n     Second, we are unconvinced that the circumstances here--\n\nat least as developed  on the present record--were as  yet so\n\n\"extreme\" as to warrant such a  measure.  Castro, 775 F.2d at\r                                                            \n\n408.    Plaintiffs  contend  that, contrary  to  the  court's\n\nfinding, only  eight of  their eleven lawsuits  were directed\n\nagainst the  IRS or its agents.   While they have  offered no\n\nsupport  therefor,   an  independent  review   confirms  this\n\ncontention.5  Of  these, the court  indicated in its  written\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  While the scheduling notice  regarding the hearing is not\nin the record, there  is no indication from the  docket sheet\nthat  it   contained  any   reference   to  proposed   filing\nrestrictions.  We also note that plaintiffs were not afforded\nan opportunity to respond following imposition of the court's\noral order,  nor  were they  invited  to file  an  opposition\nthereto prior to entry of the written order.\n\n5.  We can say with  certainty that two of the  listed cases,\nTempelman  v. United  States,  No. 91-208,  and Tempelman  v.\r                                                                     \nPhilbrick, No. 92-409, did  not involve the IRS, inasmuch  as\r                     \neach  was  the  subject of  a  recent  appeal.   (The  former\ninvolved  the  Postal Service;  the  latter  involved a  town\nmoderator.)  And a review of the docket sheet reveals  that a\nthird such action, Tempelman  v. Hebbel, No. 93-110, involved\r                                                   \na private defendant. \n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\norder  that  two others  involved  a \"rehash\"  of  the issues\n\ninvolved  in the instant  complaint; the nature  of the other\n\ncases is undisclosed (as is the disposition thereof, although\n\nit  appears safe to conclude that each was unsuccessful).  It\n\nis thus  unclear to what  extent plaintiffs have  exhibited a\n\n\"propensity to  file repeated suits  against [the IRS  or its\n\nagents] involving the same  or similar claims.\"  Id.  at 409.\r                                                                \n\nCompare,  e.g., Cok, 985 F.2d at 35, 36 (suggesting that more\r                               \n\nnarrowly drawn ban on  further attempts to remove proceedings\n\nfrom  Family Court  divorce case  would have  been approved);\n\nCastro,  775  F.2d  at   409-10  (upholding  ban  on  further\r                  \n\nchallenges  to nonrenewal  of  appellants' appointment);  see\r                                                                         \n\nPavilonis v. King, 626 F.2d 1075, 1079 (1st Cir.)  (observing\r                             \n\nthat \"litigiousness  alone will not support  an injunction\"),\n\ncert. denied, 449 U.S. 829 (1980).  \r                        \n\n     In turn, it  is worth noting  that the issue  underlying\n\nthe instant action--the propriety of  defendant's calculation\n\nof  plaintiffs' tax  liability--was  resolved in  plaintiffs'\n\nfavor in tax  court, and  that their  First Amendment  Bivens\r                                                                         \n\nclaim, while ultimately unavailing,  would seem to rise above\n\nthe  frivolous (albeit  narrowly).   At  least  a portion  of\n\nplaintiffs' litigation efforts, in other words, has contained\n\na  glimmer  of  merit.   We  also  observe  that less  severe\n\nmeasures such as the imposition of monetary  sanctions--which\n\nwe uphold in the  instant case as an appropriate  penalty for\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nplaintiffs'  aspersions against the court--might well suffice\n\nto  forestall future  actions  of a  frivolous and  vexatious\n\nnature.   Cf. Cok, 985 F.2d at 36 (cautioning that injunction\r                             \n\nrestricting court  access across  the board should  be issued\n\n\"only  when  abuse is  so  continuous  and widespread  as  to\n\nsuggest no reasonable alternative\").  \n\n     Finally, several  aspects of  the injunction  as drafted\n\ngive us pause.   The  restriction on state  court filings  is\n\nproblematic, inasmuch as \"[a]buse of state judicial processes\n\nis not  per se a  threat to the  jurisdiction of Article  III\r                          \n\ncourts.\"   In re Martin-Trigona, 737 F.2d 1254, 1263 (2d Cir.\r                                           \n\n1984)  (vacating extension  of injunction  to  state courts);\n\naccord, e.g., Anderson v.

We understand  that plaintiffs' propensity to sue\n\nin state court, combined with the automatic right  of removal\n\navailable to  the United  States and its  employees, provided\n\nthe impetus for  such a measure.   Yet  as other courts  have\n\nindicated, a narrower  restriction ordinarily should suffice.\n\nSee, e.g., Sassower  v. Abrams,  833 F. Supp.  253, 271,  274\r                                          \n\n(S.D.N.Y.  1993)  (issuing  injunction  directing  that, upon\n\nremoval to  federal court of  any case brought  by plaintiff,\n\nleave  of  court  would   be  required  before  action  could\n\ncontinue).   We  also observe  that no  guidelines have  been\n\nprovided  explaining  what  plaintiffs  must  do  to   obtain\n\npermission  to file, see, e.g.,  Werner v. State  of Utah, 32\r                                                                     \n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nF.3d 1446, 1448  (10th Cir.  1994)--a matter  worthy of  note\n\nhere  given the  broad category  of  actions embraced  by the\n\ninjunction.\n\n     It  is important  to  emphasize  that,  in the  face  of\n\nplaintiffs'  spurious  accusations  and  rancorous  tone, the\n\ndistrict court's  evident exasperation was  fully explicable;\n\nindeed,  the care  it  devoted to  a  case bordering  on  the\n\nfrivolous  is  commendable.   Nonetheless,  in  light of  the\n\nforegoing factors,  we think it appropriate  to await another\n\nday before  taking the exceptional step  of enjoining further\n\nlawsuits.  \n\n     The dismissal of plaintiffs'  complaint is affirmed,  as\r                                                                    \n\nis  the imposition  of  monetary sanctions.   The  injunction\n\nbarring further court filings is vacated.  \r                                                    \n\n     So ordered.\r                           \n\n                             -14-\r\r\n",

In 1992, based upon audits of plaintiffs' returns for the years 1986 through 1988, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined, inter alia, that various deductions had been improperly claimed and that additional taxes were owed.  Plaintiffs successfully challenged this determination in tax court, where a settlement with the IRS resulted in the elimination of most or all of such liability.  They then filed the instant pro se action in state court, seeking damages from the IRS agent who had conducted the audits.  Plaintiffs charged that defendant had deliberately and maliciously imposed further tax liabilities in retaliation for their dissident views, in violation of various statutory and constitutional provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant removed the action to federal court and then moved to dismiss, claiming that parts of the complaint were jurisdictionally defective while other parts failed to state a claim.  In a comprehensive opinion, the district court agreed and dismissed the complaint under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) &amp; (6).  The court went on to find that plaintiffs were engaged in a \"vendetta\" against the IRS, having filed numerous frivolous cases against the agency and its employees solely for the purpose of harassment.  As a result, the court enjoined plaintiffs from filing any further such actions without judicial approval.  It also imposed monetary sanctions.  Plaintiffs, in summary fashion, challenge each of these rulings on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long over the merits of the complaint.  Plaintiffs have relied on a plethora of statutory provisions in an attempt to establish jurisdiction and/or state a claim.  Each proves unavailing.  For example, two criminal provisions on which they rely-18 U.S.C. Secs. 241, 242-do not give rise to a civil action for damages.  See, e.g., Rodi v. Ventetuolo, 941 F.2d 22, 29 n.8 (1st Cir. 1991);  Cok v. Cosentino, 876 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam).  A third such provision, contained in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7214, is likewise inapposite;  \"a precondition to a taxpayer suit for damages against a revenue agent under this provision is the criminal conviction of the agent.\"  Hollett v. Browning, 711 F. Supp. 1009, 1012 n.2 (E.D. Cal. 1988).  Plaintiffs' reliance on 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1983, 1985 (and their jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1343) is misplaced.  Section 1983 is inapplicable to federal officials not alleged to have acted \"under color of state law.\"  See, e.g., District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U.S. 418, 424-25 (1973);  Soldevilla v. Secretary of Agric., 512 F.2d 427, 429 (1st Cir. 1975).  In turn, as the district court discussed at length, plaintiffs have not come close to stating a claim under Sec. 1985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No more helpful is plaintiffs' invocation of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. Secs. 1346(b), 2671-80.  Explicitly excluded from the FTCA's ambit is \"[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax.\"  Id. Sec. 2680(c);  see, e.g., McMillen v. United States Dep't of Treasury, 960 F.2d 187, 188 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).  Contrary to plaintiffs' contention, the allegations here fall readily within this exception.  See, e.g., National Commodity and Barter Ass'n v. Gibbs, 886 F.2d 1240, 1246 (10th Cir. 1989);  Capozzoli v. Tracey, 663 F.2d 654, 658 (5th Cir. 1981) (Sec. 2680(c) has been \"interpreted broadly\" to cover activities that were \"in any way related to the [IRS] agents' official duties\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' reliance on 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7433(a) also proves misplaced.  This provision authorizes a civil action for damages whenever an IRS official \"recklessly or intentionally disregards\" the tax laws in connection with \"any collection\" of federal taxes.  Yet plaintiffs are complaining of alleged misconduct that occurred in connection with the calculation of their tax liability, rather than with the collection thereof.  Such a claim is not cognizable under Sec. 7433.  See, e.g., Shaw v. United States, 20 F.3d 182, 184 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 63 U.S.L.W. 3181 (1994);  Gonsalves v. IRS, 975 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam).  Furthermore, a prerequisite to any such action is that the taxpayer exhaust his or her administrative remedies, see 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7433(d)(1), by filing a written administrative claim with \"the district director ... of the district in which the taxpayer currently resides,\" 26 C.F.R. Sec. 301.7433-1(e)(1).  There is no suggestion that plaintiffs have complied with this requirement.  The failure to do so deprives the court of jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Venen v. United States,  F.3d , 1994 WL 567016, at * 2-* 3 (3d Cir. 1994);  Conforte v. United States, 979 F.2d 1375, 1377 (9th Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs have sought to advance a Bivens claim against defendant in her personal capacity.  See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).  In this regard, they contend that defendant's actions abridged their rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Because plaintiffs on appeal have mentioned the point only in passing, it suffices to note the following.  As we explained in McMillen, courts have been disinclined to create Bivens remedies in the internal revenue context in light of the \"remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations\" that Congress has already implemented in this area.  960 F.2d at 190-91 (quoting Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412, 423 (1988)).  In particular, courts have specifically disavowed any Bivens remedy for alleged violations associated with tax assessment and collection activities.  See, e.g., Vennes v. An Unknown Number of Unidentified Agents, 26 F.3d 1448, 1453-54 (8th Cir.), petition for cert. filed, 63 U.S.L.W. 3192 (1994);  McMillen, 960 F.2d at 190-91;  Wages v. IRS, 915 F.2d 1230, 1235 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1096 (1991);  Gibbs, 886 F.2d at 1247-48;  Tonn v. United States, 847 F. Supp. 711, 716-18 (D. Minn. 1993), aff'd, 27 F.3d 1356 (8th Cir. 1994) (per curiam);  see also Cameron v. IRS, 773 F.2d 126, 128-29 (7th Cir. 1985);  cf.  FDIC v. Meyer, 114 S. Ct. 996, 1005-06 (1994) (declining to imply Bivens action against federal agencies).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of these cases, it is true, involved alleged due process violations, whereas plaintiffs have also claimed abridgement of their First (and Fourth) Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  At least under the facts alleged, however, this is without consequence.  The Tenth Circuit's pair of opinions in Gibbs (\"NCBA I \"), 886 F.2d 1240, and National Commodity and Barter Ass'n v. Archer, 31 F.3d 1521 (10th Cir. 1994) (\"NCBA II \") (the appeal following remand), are instructive.  With respect to allegations that IRS agents had engaged in widespread misconduct with respect to a tax-protesting organization-including repeated raids of its headquarters and its members' homes and seizures of membership records-the court held that a Bivens claim had been stated under the First and Fourth Amendments.  See NCBA I, 886 F.2d at 1248;  NCBA II, 31 F.3d at 1527-32.  However, with respect to allegations that the IRS had effected \"wrongful jeopardy assessments,\" the court declined to recognize a First or Fourth Amendment Bivens remedy \"[i]n light of the remedies afforded elsewhere.\"  Id. at 1532.  So here, we think the panoply of statutory remedies available militates against recognition of a First or Fourth Amendment Bivens remedy with respect to the wrongful assessment of plaintiffs' tax liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remaining for consideration is the propriety of the sanctions imposed upon plaintiffs-as to which some additional background is necessary.  In response to the district court's order of dismissal, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration.  Displaying a lack of familiarity with the sovereign immunity doctrine, they there castigated the court for leaving them with \"no remedy\" in \"clear defiance of and contempt for federal law.\"  They then proceeded, in increasingly intemperate language, to warn the district judge that unless the dismissal were rescinded he would \"stand liable\" for possible constitutional violations and would run the risk of impeachment and of being named as \"a co-conspirator in a far larger Civil Rights matter which is coming before this court in a series of actions.\"  According to their certificate of service, plaintiffs sent copies of this motion to some 28 political officials and various media outlets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge held a hearing on the motion, at which plaintiffs enumerated at some length (and in reasonably decorous fashion) their objections to the order of dismissal.  The court thereafter, in an oral ruling, voiced its disapproval of plaintiffs' conduct.  Their veiled suggestion that the court had conspired with the government, it held, bordered on \"criminal contempt.\"  Their treatment of court personnel had been \"insulting\" and \"bully[ing].\"  And their \"vendetta against the IRS and its employees\"-pursued through a series of \"frivolous\" and \"harassing\" lawsuits-had \"gone on too long.\"  Accordingly, the court entered a sua sponte order enjoining plaintiffs from filing any further actions in the District of New Hampshire \"against the IRS,\" including suits removable from state court, without judicial approval.  It also imposed sanctions in the amount of $293 (representing the travel costs incurred by government counsel to attend the hearing).  In a subsequent written order in support of this ruling, the court noted that the instant case was one of eleven actions that plaintiffs had prosecuted in New Hampshire federal court since 1986, ten of which the court found had involved the IRS or its agents.  The court reiterated its injunction as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clerk of this court is ordered not to accept any more cases from the plaintiff unless screened by a Judge Magistrate or Judge of this court.  If the plaintiff by subterfuge, or any other means[,] sues in a state court knowing that it has to be removed by the government to this court, he shall be subject to immediate sanctions....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also there denied the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts, of course, \"possess discretionary powers to regulate the conduct of abusive litigants.\"  Cok v. Family Court of Rhode Island, 985 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam).  Accordingly, \"in extreme circumstances involving groundless encroachment upon the limited time and resources of the court and other parties, an injunction barring a party from filing and processing frivolous and vexatious lawsuits may be appropriate.\"  Castro v. United States, 775 F.2d 399, 408 (1st Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  Any bar on future litigation must be \"narrowly tailored\" to \"fit the specific vice encountered.\"  Sires v. Gabriel, 748 F.2d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 1984) (per curiam).  As we have explained, if such an injunction \"were couched in overly broad terms, this could impermissibly infringe upon a litigator's right of access to the courts.\"  Castro, 775 F.2d at 410.  We review the entry of such an injunction for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g ., id. at 408.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it obvious, under the circumstances, that the district court intended to restrict the filing of any new actions against the IRS or its agents (as indicated in the oral order), rather than to restrict court access across the board (as suggested in the written order).  Even as so construed, the injunction raises several concerns.  An initial problem is that plaintiffs were not \"warned or otherwise given notice that filing restrictions were contemplated,\" and thus were not afforded \"an opportunity to respond\" before entry thereof.  Cok, 985 F.2d at 35.  In Cok, just as in the instant case, the court entered an injunction on a sua sponte basis at the close of a motion hearing.  We noted that where the plaintiff had been deprived of even \"informal\" notice-such as might be provided by way of a defendant's request for an injunction or a magistrate's recommendation thereof-the customary route was to issue a show cause order or a \"cautionary\" edict.  Id. Nothing of the sort occurred here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we are unconvinced that the circumstances here-at least as developed on the present record-were as yet so \"extreme\" as to warrant such a measure.  Castro, 775 F.2d at 408.  Plaintiffs contend that, contrary to the court's finding, only eight of their eleven lawsuits were directed against the IRS or its agents.  While they have offered no support therefor, an independent review confirms this contention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Of these, the court indicated in its written order that two others involved a \"rehash\" of the issues involved in the instant complaint;  the nature of the other cases is undisclosed (as is the disposition thereof, although it appears safe to conclude that each was unsuccessful).  It is thus unclear to what extent plaintiffs have exhibited a \"propensity to file repeated suits against [the IRS or its agents] involving the same or similar claims.\"  Id. at 409.  Compare, e.g., Cok, 985 F.2d at 35, 36 (suggesting that more narrowly drawn ban on further attempts to remove proceedings from Family Court divorce case would have been approved);  Castro, 775 F.2d at 409-10 (upholding ban on further challenges to nonrenewal of appellants' appointment);  see Pavilonis v. King, 626 F.2d 1075, 1079 (1st Cir.)  (observing that \"litigiousness alone will not support an injunction\"), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 829 (1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In turn, it is worth noting that the issue underlying the instant action-the propriety of defendant's calculation of plaintiffs' tax liability-was resolved in plaintiffs' favor in tax court, and that their First Amendment Bivens claim, while ultimately unavailing, would seem to rise above the frivolous (albeit narrowly).  At least a portion of plaintiffs' litigation efforts, in other words, has contained a glimmer of merit.  We also observe that less severe measures such as the imposition of monetary sanctions-which we uphold in the instant case as an appropriate penalty for plaintiffs' aspersions against the court-might well suffice to forestall future actions of a frivolous and vexatious nature.  Cf. Cok, 985 F.2d at 36 (cautioning that injunction restricting court access across the board should be issued \"only when abuse is so continuous and widespread as to suggest no reasonable alternative\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, several aspects of the injunction as drafted give us pause.  The restriction on state court filings is problematic, inasmuch as \"[a]buse of state judicial processes is not per se a threat to the jurisdiction of Article III courts.\"  In re Martin-Trigona, 737 F.2d 1254, 1263 (2d Cir. 1984) (vacating extension of injunction to state courts);  accord, e.g., Anderson v. Mackall, 128 F.R.D. 223, 226 (E.D. Va. 1988).  We understand that plaintiffs' propensity to sue in state court, combined with the automatic right of removal available to the United States and its employees, provided the impetus for such a measure.  Yet as other courts have indicated, a narrower restriction ordinarily should suffice.  See, e.g., Sassower v. Abrams, 833 F. Supp. 253, 271, 274 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (issuing injunction directing that, upon removal to federal court of any case brought by plaintiff, leave of court would be required before action could continue).  We also observe that no guidelines have been provided explaining what plaintiffs must do to obtain permission to file, see, e.g., Werner v. State of Utah, 32 F.3d 1446, 1448 (10th Cir. 1994)-a matter worthy of note here given the broad category of actions embraced by the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to emphasize that, in the face of plaintiffs' spurious accusations and rancorous tone, the district court's evident exasperation was fully explicable;  indeed, the care it devoted to a case bordering on the frivolous is commendable.  Nonetheless, in light of the foregoing factors, we think it appropriate to await another day before taking the exceptional step of enjoining further lawsuits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint is affirmed, as is the imposition of monetary sanctions.  The injunction barring further court filings is vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Given the disposition we reach, there is no need to decide whether the notice of appeal was ineffective as to Priscilla Tempelman, as defendant suggests</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In their district court pleadings, plaintiffs conceded that their Eighth Amendment claim was without merit.  A similar conclusion applies as to their Fourteenth Amendment claim.  In turn, we have difficulty perceiving how the Fourth Amendment is implicated by plaintiffs' allegations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also allege that their suit was improperly removed to federal court.  Removal was plainly appropriate under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1442(a)(1) (pertaining to suits against \"[a]ny officer of the United States ... for any act under color of such office\"), inasmuch as defendant's relationship to plaintiffs \"derived solely from [her] official duties.\"  Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U.S. 402, 409 (1969);  accord, e.g., Palermo v. Rorex, 806 F.2d 1266, 1269-70 (5th Cir.)  (rejecting argument that defendants were not acting \"under color of federal office\" because their acts were alleged to have been maliciously motivated), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 819 (1987);  see also Arizona v. Manypenny, 451 U.S. 232, 242 (1981) (\"the right of removal is absolute for conduct performed under color of federal office\").  As such, plaintiffs' inability to subpoena the United States Attorney in order to examine the validity of his 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2679(d) certification-about which they also complain-was without consequence</p>\n        <p>As well, plaintiffs object that the district judge recused himself on the same day that he denied their motion for reconsideration.  To the contrary, the record reveals that plaintiffs' motion for recusal was denied on that date.  We are told that the judge subsequently recused himself from other cases involving plaintiffs-an action that has no bearing on the instant matter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While the scheduling notice regarding the hearing is not in the record, there is no indication from the docket sheet that it contained any reference to proposed filing restrictions.  We also note that plaintiffs were not afforded an opportunity to respond following imposition of the court's oral order, nor were they invited to file an opposition thereto prior to entry of the written order</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We can say with certainty that two of the listed cases, Tempelman v. United States, No. 91-208, and Tempelman v. Philbrick, No. 92-409, did not involve the IRS, inasmuch as each was the subject of a recent appeal.  (The former involved the Postal Service;  the latter involved a town moderator.)  And a review of the docket sheet reveals that a third such action, Tempelman v. Hebbel, No. 93-110, involved a private defendant</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In 1992, based upon audits of plaintiffs' returns for the years 1986 through 1988, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined, inter alia, that various deductions had been improperly claimed and that additional taxes were owed.  Plaintiffs successfully challenged this determination in tax court, where a settlement with the IRS resulted in the elimination of most or all of such liability.  They then filed the instant pro se action in state court, seeking damages from the IRS agent who had conducted the audits.  Plaintiffs charged that defendant had deliberately and maliciously imposed further tax liabilities in retaliation for their dissident views, in violation of various statutory and constitutional provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant removed the action to federal court and then moved to dismiss, claiming that parts of the complaint were jurisdictionally defective while other parts failed to state a claim.  In a comprehensive opinion, the district court agreed and dismissed the complaint under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) &amp; (6).  The court went on to find that plaintiffs were engaged in a \"vendetta\" against the IRS, having filed numerous frivolous cases against the agency and its employees solely for the purpose of harassment.  As a result, the court enjoined plaintiffs from filing any further such actions without judicial approval.  It also imposed monetary sanctions.  Plaintiffs, in summary fashion, challenge each of these rulings on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long over the merits of the complaint.  Plaintiffs have relied on a plethora of statutory provisions in an attempt to establish jurisdiction and/or state a claim.  Each proves unavailing.  For example, two criminal provisions on which they rely-18 U.S.C. Secs. 241, 242-do not give rise to a civil action for damages.  See, e.g., Rodi v. Ventetuolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566305\"><a href=\"/opinion/566305/stephen-gerard-rodi-v-donald-r-ventetuolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 29 n.8 (1st Cir. 1991);  Cok v.

A third such provision, contained in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7214, is likewise inapposite;  \"a precondition to a taxpayer suit for damages against a revenue agent under this provision is the criminal conviction of the agent.\"  Hollett v. Browning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1655267\"><a href=\"/opinion/1655267/hollett-v-browning/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span>, 1012 n.2 (E.D. Cal. 1988).  Plaintiffs' reliance on 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1983, 1985 (and their jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1343) is misplaced.  Section 1983 is inapplicable to federal officials not alleged to have acted \"under color of state law.\"  See, e.g., District of Columbia v.

Sec. 7433(a) also proves misplaced.  This provision authorizes a civil action for damages whenever an IRS official \"recklessly or intentionally disregards\" the tax laws in connection with \"any collection\" of federal taxes.  Yet plaintiffs are complaining of alleged misconduct that occurred in connection with the calculation of their tax liability, rather than with the collection thereof.  Such a claim is not cognizable under Sec. 7433.  See, e.g., Shaw v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666581\"><a href=\"/opinion/666581/billie-a-shaw-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 184 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.L.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">3181</span> </span>(1994);  Gonsalves v.

Furthermore, a prerequisite to any such action is that the taxpayer exhaust his or her administrative remedies, see 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7433(d)(1), by filing a written administrative claim with \"the district director ... of the district in which the taxpayer currently resides,\" 26 C.F.R. Sec. 301.7433-1(e)(1).  There is no suggestion that plaintiffs have complied with this requirement.  The failure to do so deprives the court of jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Venen v. United States,  F.3d , <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">567016</span></span>, at * 2-* 3 (3d Cir. 1994);  Conforte v.

In this regard, they contend that defendant's actions abridged their rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Because plaintiffs on appeal have mentioned the point only in passing, it suffices to note the following.  As we explained in McMillen, courts have been disinclined to create Bivens remedies in the internal revenue context in light of the \"remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations\" that Congress has already implemented in this <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580692\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">area.</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/580692/raymond-e-mcmillen-jr-and-laura-mcmillen-v-united-states-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">190-91</span> </a></span>(quoting Schweiker v.

With respect to allegations that IRS agents had engaged in widespread misconduct with respect to a tax-protesting organization-including repeated raids of its headquarters and its members' homes and seizures of membership records-the court held that a Bivens claim had been stated under the First and Fourth Amendments.  See NCBA <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530046\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">I,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/530046/national-commodity-and-barter-association-national-commodity-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span>;  NCBA <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676058\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/676058/national-commodity-and-barter-association-national-commodity-exchange-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1527-32</span></a></span>.  However, with respect to allegations that the IRS had effected \"wrongful jeopardy assessments,\" the court declined to recognize a First or Fourth Amendment Bivens remedy \"[i]n light of the remedies afforded elsewhere.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676058\"><a href=\"/opinion/676058/national-commodity-and-barter-association-national-commodity-exchange-v/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1532. </a></span> So here, we think the panoply of statutory remedies available militates against recognition of a First or Fourth Amendment Bivens remedy with respect to the wrongful assessment of plaintiffs' tax liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remaining for consideration is the propriety of the sanctions imposed upon plaintiffs-as to which some additional background is necessary.  In response to the district court's order of dismissal, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration.  Displaying a lack of familiarity with the sovereign immunity doctrine, they there castigated the court for leaving them with \"no remedy\" in \"clear defiance of and contempt for federal law.\"  They then proceeded, in increasingly intemperate language, to warn the district judge that unless the dismissal were rescinded he would \"stand liable\" for possible constitutional violations and would run the risk of impeachment and of being named as \"a co-conspirator in a far larger Civil Rights matter which is coming before this court in a series of actions.\"  According to their certificate of service, plaintiffs sent copies of this motion to some 28 political officials and various media outlets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge held a hearing on the motion, at which plaintiffs enumerated at some length (and in reasonably decorous fashion) their objections to the order of dismissal.  The court thereafter, in an oral ruling, voiced its disapproval of plaintiffs' conduct.  Their veiled suggestion that the court had conspired with the government, it held, bordered on \"criminal contempt.\"  Their treatment of court personnel had been \"insulting\" and \"bully[ing].\"  And their \"vendetta against the IRS and its employees\"-pursued through a series of \"frivolous\" and \"harassing\" lawsuits-had \"gone on too long.\"  Accordingly, the court entered a sua sponte order enjoining plaintiffs from filing any further actions in the District of New Hampshire \"against the IRS,\" including suits removable from state court, without judicial approval.  It also imposed sanctions in the amount of $293 (representing the travel costs incurred by government counsel to attend the hearing).  In a subsequent written order in support of this ruling, the court noted that the instant case was one of eleven actions that plaintiffs had prosecuted in New Hampshire federal court since 1986, ten of which the court found had involved the IRS or its agents.  The court reiterated its injunction as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clerk of this court is ordered not to accept any more cases from the plaintiff unless screened by a Judge Magistrate or Judge of this court.

As we have explained, if such an injunction \"were couched in overly broad terms, this could impermissibly infringe upon a litigator's right of access to the courts.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460032\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Castro,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/460032/39-fair-emplpraccas-162-38-empl-prac-dec-p-35583-eligio-castro-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>.  We review the entry of such an injunction for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460032\"><a href=\"/opinion/460032/39-fair-emplpraccas-162-38-empl-prac-dec-p-35583-eligio-castro-and/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 408.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it obvious, under the circumstances, that the district court intended to restrict the filing of any new actions against the IRS or its agents (as indicated in the oral order), rather than to restrict court access across the board (as suggested in the written order).  Even as so construed, the injunction raises several concerns.  An initial problem is that plaintiffs were not \"warned or otherwise given notice that filing restrictions were contemplated,\" and thus were not afforded \"an opportunity to respond\" before entry thereof.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599290\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cok,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/599290/gladys-l-cok-v-family-court-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>.  In Cok, just as in the instant case, the court entered an injunction on a sua sponte basis at the close of a motion hearing.  We noted that where the plaintiff had been deprived of even \"informal\" notice-such as might be provided by way of a defendant's request for an injunction or a magistrate's recommendation thereof-the customary route was to issue a show cause order or a \"cautionary\" edict.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599290\"><a href=\"/opinion/599290/gladys-l-cok-v-family-court-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Nothing of </a></span>the sort occurred here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we are unconvinced that the circumstances here-at least as developed on the present record-were as yet so \"extreme\" as to warrant such a measure.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460032\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Castro,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/460032/39-fair-emplpraccas-162-38-empl-prac-dec-p-35583-eligio-castro-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>.  Plaintiffs contend that, contrary to the court's finding, only eight of their eleven lawsuits were directed against the IRS or its agents.  While they have offered no support therefor, an independent review confirms this contention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Of these, the court indicated in its written order that two others involved a \"rehash\" of the issues involved in the instant complaint;  the nature of the other cases is undisclosed (as is the disposition thereof, although it appears safe to conclude that each was unsuccessful).

At least a portion of plaintiffs' litigation efforts, in other words, has contained a glimmer of merit.  We also observe that less severe measures such as the imposition of monetary sanctions-which we uphold in the instant case as an appropriate penalty for plaintiffs' aspersions against the court-might well suffice to forestall future actions of a frivolous and vexatious nature.  Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599290\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Cok,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/599290/gladys-l-cok-v-family-court-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">36</span> </a></span>(cautioning that injunction restricting court access across the board should be issued \"only when abuse is so continuous and widespread as to suggest no reasonable alternative\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, several aspects of the injunction as drafted give us pause.  The restriction on state court filings is problematic, inasmuch as \"[a]buse of state judicial processes is not per se a threat to the jurisdiction of Article III courts.\"  In re Martin-Trigona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437631\"><a href=\"/opinion/437631/in-re-anthony-r-martin-trigona-appeal-of-anthony-r-martin-trigona/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span>, 1263 (2d Cir. 1984) (vacating extension of injunction to state courts);  accord, e.g., Anderson v.

We understand that plaintiffs' propensity to sue in state court, combined with the automatic right of removal available to the United States and its employees, provided the impetus for such a measure.  Yet as other courts have indicated, a narrower restriction ordinarily should suffice.  See, e.g., Sassower v. Abrams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1361800\"><a href=\"/opinion/1361800/sassower-v-abrams/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Sec. 2679(d) certification-about which they also complain-was without consequence</p>\n        <p>As well, plaintiffs object that the district judge recused himself on the same day that he denied their motion for reconsideration.  To the contrary, the record reveals that plaintiffs' motion for recusal was denied on that date.  We are told that the judge subsequently recused himself from other cases involving plaintiffs-an action that has no bearing on the instant matter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While the scheduling notice regarding the hearing is not in the record, there is no indication from the docket sheet that it contained any reference to proposed filing restrictions.  We also note that plaintiffs were not afforded an opportunity to respond following imposition of the court's oral order, nor were they invited to file an opposition thereto prior to entry of the written order</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We can say with certainty that two of the listed cases, Tempelman v. United States, No. 91-208, and Tempelman v. Philbrick, No. 92-409, did not involve the IRS, inasmuch as each was the subject of a recent appeal.  (The former involved the Postal Service;  the latter involved a town moderator.)  And a review of the docket sheet reveals that a third such action, Tempelman v. Hebbel, No. 93-110, involved a private defendant</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
