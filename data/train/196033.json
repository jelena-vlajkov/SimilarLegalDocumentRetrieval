United States v.  Abreu, 952 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\n1458, 1460 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1695  (1992).  On\r                                             \n\nFebruary  15, 1994,  Reyes,  a native  citizen  of the  Dominican\n\nRepublic,  arrived from the Dominican Republic  at the Luis Mu oz\n\nMar n  International Airport in Puerto  Rico.  While applying for\n\nentry  at the  United States  immigration inspection  area, Reyes\n\npresented his  Dominican passport, an alien  Registration Receipt\n\nCard,  his  Social  Security  card,  and  his  completed  customs\n\ndeclaration   form.    Immigration   officials  inspecting  these\n\ndocuments discovered that Reyes had been previously deported from\n\nthe United States on August 18, 1993, after having been convicted\n\nof  an  aggravated felony.   Reyes  had  previously lived  in the\n\nUnited  States  for  approximately  ten years.    Officials  also\n\nascertained  that he  had not  obtained the  express  consent and\n\npermission  of  the  Attorney  General of  the  United  States to\n\nreenter the country.   Reyes was then arrested and  later charged\n\nwith violation of 8 U.S.C.   1326.\n\n                             ANALYSIS\r                                       ANALYSIS\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          Reyes argues  that the  evidence presented at  trial is\n\ninsufficient to  sustain his  conviction, because  the government\n\nfailed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt two  of the elements of\n\nthe  crime charged.  First, he contends, the government failed to\n\naffirmatively  prove the  legality  of Reyes'  prior deportation.\n\nSecond, Reyes claims that  the government did not prove  beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that  he intended  to enter  the United  States.\n\nBecause   he  did  not  realize  that  entering  Puerto  Rico  is\n\ntantamount to entering the United States, Reyes argues, he lacked\n\nthe necessary criminal intent,  and his conviction must therefore\n\nbe reversed.\n\n          When reviewing sufficiency  of the evidence challenges,\n\nwe assess the sufficiency of the evidence as a whole in the light\n\nmost favorable to the verdict, with a view  to whether a rational\n\ntrier  of fact  could have  found the  defendant guilty  beyond a\n\nreasonable  doubt.   We  do  not weigh  witness  credibility, but\n\nresolve all credibility issues  in favor of the verdict.   United\r                                                                           \n\nStates v. Hahn,  17 F.3d 502, 506 (1st Cir.  1994).  The evidence\r                        \n\nmay  be  entirely  circumstantial,  and need  not  exclude  every\n\nreasonable  hypothesis  of  innocence.     In  other  words,  the\n\nfactfinder  may decide  among reasonable  interpretations  of the\n\nevidence.  Id.\r                       \n\n          Sections 1326(a)  and (b)(2)  provide in  relevant part\n\nthat:  1) any  alien; 2)  whose deportation  was subsequent  to a\n\nconviction for commission of an aggravated  felony; 3) who enters\n\nor attempts  to enter, or  is at  any time found  in, the  United\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nStates; 4) without the express consent from the Attorney  General\n\nfor such reentry; 5)  shall be fined and/or imprisoned.  8 U.S.C.\n\n  1326.    Proving a  lawful  prior deportation  is part  of  the\n\ngovernment's  burden in establishing a    1326 violation.

United  States v. Ayala, 35 F.3d 423, 426 (9th Cir.\r                                               \n\n1994) (citing United States v.

(per curiam),\r                           \n\ncert.  denied,  459 U.S.  869 (1982);  but  see United  States v.\r                                                                        \n\nAnton, 683 F.2d 1011 (7th Cir. 1982)(requiring specific intent).\r               \n\n          Applying  these principles  to  Reyes'  first  argument\n\nregarding  the government's  alleged  failure to  prove that  his\n\ndeportation was lawful,  we find his claim  to be meritless.   It\n\nappears from the  record that Reyes  did not collaterally  attack\n\nthe  validity of his deportation  either before or  at trial, but\n\nsimply comes before us  now and contends that the  government did\n\nnot   adduce  sufficient   evidence  of   the  legality   of  his\n\ndeportation.  The government,  however, submitted at trial Reyes'\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nwarrant  of deportation,  which  certified  that his  deportation\n\norders  were issued and carried  out after due  hearing before an\n\nauthorized officer.  We think that this evidence suffices to make\n\nout a prima facie  case that Reyes was legally  deported, and the\n\njury was entitled to find, in  light of this evidence and nothing\n\non record to contradict it, that the government met its burden of\n\nproof as to this element.\n\n          Reyes' second argument, that he did not intend to enter\n\nthe  United States because he  believed that Puerto  Rico was not\n\npart  of the United States, must also  fail.  Although it is true\n\nthat  many  people do  not  realize that  Puerto Rico  is  a U.S.\n\npossession, the sincerity or reasonableness of Reyes' beliefs are\n\nirrelevant.  Even  assuming that such  a defense were  available,\n\nthere was sufficient  evidence for  the jury to  find that  Reyes\n\nknew  that  he was  entering the  United  States.   During cross-\n\nexamination, the  government coaxed an admission  from Reyes that\n\nhe had  visited Puerto Rico  before, at some  point while  he was\n\nresiding in  the United States.  On that  visit, he had had to go\n\nthrough the United States immigration and customs point in  order\n\nto enter Puerto Rico.   The jury was entitled to infer,  based on\n\nthis admission, that Reyes must have known that he would face the\n\nsame United  States immigration  and customs  point, and that  he\n\ntherefore must  have  also known  that entering  Puerto Rico  was\n\ntantamount  to entering  the United  States.   The jury  was also\n\nentitled  to  disbelieve  Reyes.   We  therefore  find that  this\n\ncircumstantial evidence  of his  intent is sufficient  to support\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nthe jury's guilty verdict.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Reyes' conviction.\r                                                        \n\n                               -6-\r\r\n",

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1695</span> </span>(1992).  On February 15, 1994, Reyes, a native citizen of the Dominican Republic, arrived from the Dominican Republic at the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in Puerto Rico.  While applying for entry at the United States immigration inspection area, Reyes presented his Dominican passport, an alien Registration Receipt Card, his Social Security card, and his completed customs declaration form.  Immigration officials inspecting these documents discovered that Reyes had been previously deported from the United States on August 18, 1993, after having been convicted of an aggravated felony.  Reyes had previously lived in the United States for approximately ten years.  Officials also ascertained that he had not obtained the express consent and permission of the Attorney General of the United States to reenter the country.  Reyes was then arrested and later charged with violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes argues that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to sustain his conviction, because the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt two of the elements of the crime charged.  First, he contends, the government failed to affirmatively prove the legality of Reyes' prior deportation.  Second, Reyes claims that the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to enter the United States.  Because he did not realize that entering Puerto Rico is tantamount to entering the United States, Reyes argues, he lacked the necessary criminal intent, and his conviction must therefore be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When reviewing sufficiency of the evidence challenges, we assess the sufficiency of the evidence as a whole in the light most favorable to the verdict, with a view to whether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  We do not weigh witness credibility, but resolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  United States v.

An overwhelming majority of other circuits to decide this issue have held that the government need not prove that a defendant had specific intent to violate the statute;  all that is required is that a defendant enter or attempt to enter the United States voluntarily.

It appears from the record that Reyes did not collaterally attack the validity of his deportation either before or at trial, but simply comes before us now and contends that the government did not adduce sufficient evidence of the legality of his deportation.  The government, however, submitted at trial Reyes' warrant of deportation, which certified that his deportation orders were issued and carried out after due hearing before an authorized officer.  We think that this evidence suffices to make out a prima facie case that Reyes was legally deported, and the jury was entitled to find, in light of this evidence and nothing on record to contradict it, that the government met its burden of proof as to this element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes' second argument, that he did not intend to enter the United States because he believed that Puerto Rico was not part of the United States, must also fail.  Although it is true that many people do not realize that Puerto Rico is a U.S. possession, the sincerity or reasonableness of Reyes' beliefs are irrelevant.  Even assuming that such a defense were available, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Reyes knew that he was entering the United States.  During cross-examination, the government coaxed an admission from Reyes that he had visited Puerto Rico before, at some point while he was residing in the United States.  On that visit, he had had to go through the United States immigration and customs point in order to enter Puerto Rico.  The jury was entitled to infer, based on this admission, that Reyes must have known that he would face the same United States immigration and customs point, and that he therefore must have also known that entering Puerto Rico was tantamount to entering the United States.  The jury was also entitled to disbelieve Reyes.  We therefore find that this circumstantial evidence of his intent is sufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Reyes' conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
