After many  years of study  and\r                    SELYA, Circuit Judge.\r                                        \r\n\ndebate, Congress passed  the Sentencing Reform Act  of 1984, Pub.\r\n\nL. 98-473, tit. II,    212(a), 98 Stat. 1837 (1984) (codified  as\r\n\namended   at  scattered  sections  of  18  &amp;  28  U.S.C.).    The\r\n\nlegislation took effect on November 1, 1987,  and caused dramatic\r\n\nchanges both in the methodology of criminal sentencing and in the\r\n\noutcomes  produced.    These   changes  did  not  go  unremarked:\r\n\nsentencing appeals,  once rare in federal  criminal cases, became\r\n\ncommonplace.   Predictably, the  tidal wave  of appeals  loosed a\r\n\nflood  of judicial  opinions distilling  the meaning,  scope, and\r\n\napplication of  a seemingly  boundless sea of  guidelines, policy\r\n\nstatements, notes, and commentary.  And whenever it appeared that\r\n\nthe flood waters might recede, the Sentencing Commission launched\r\n\na  fresh deluge of revisions  that required the  courts to paddle\r\n\neven faster in a Sisyphean effort to stay afloat.\r\n\n          These four  consolidated appeals are emblematic  of the\r\n\ndifficulties  that courts face in dealing with the new sentencing\r\n\nregime.  All  four appeals  implicate Application Note  2 to  the\r\n\nCareer Offender  Guideline, as modified by  Amendment 506, United\r\n\nStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual   4B1.1, comment.\r                                                         \r\n\n(n.2) (Nov. 1994).  No appellate court has addressed the validity\r\n\nof  Amendment  506,   and,  in  the  quartet  of  criminal  cases\r\n\nunderlying  these  appeals,  two  able  district  judges  reached\r\n\ndiametrically opposite conclusions.   Although the call is close,\r\n\nwe  hold that Amendment 506 is a reasonable implementation of the\r\n\nstatutory  mandate, 28 U.S.C.   994(h) (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993), and\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nis therefore  valid.   Thus, after answering  other case-specific\r\n\nquestions raised by the various  parties, we affirm the judgments\r\n\nin  the LaBonte  and  Piper cases;  vacate  the judgment  in  the\r                                     \r\n\nHunnewell   case   and   remand   for   reconsideration  of   the\r                   \r\n\nappropriateness of resentencing; affirm  the judgment in the Dyer\r                                                                           \r\n\ncase in  respect to  all non-sentence-related matters  and vacate\r\n\nthe  sentence-related aspect  of  that  judgment,  remanding  for\r\n\nreconsideration.\r\n\nI.  THE AMENDMENT\r          I.  THE AMENDMENT\r\n\n          Congress created the  Sentencing Commission in 1984  to\r\n\ndesign  and  implement  federal  sentencing  guidelines.    Three\r\n\nprincipal forces  propelled the legislation:   Congress sought to\r\n\nestablish truth in sentencing by eliminating parole, to guarantee\r\n\nuniformity in sentencing for  similarly situated defendants,  and\r\n\nto ensure that the punishment fit the crime.  See U.S.S.G. ch. 1,\r                                                           \r\n\npt. A(3), &amp;  2; see also  United States v.  Unger, 915 F.2d  759,\r                                                           \r\n\n762-63 (1st Cir.  1990) (explaining that the primary  purposes of\r\n\nthe Sentencing  Reform Act are to  provide certainty, uniformity,\r\n\nand fairness in sentencing), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1104  (1991).\r                                                   \r\n\nIn addition to general  guidance, see, e.g., 28 U.S.C.    991(b),\r                                                     \r\n\nCongress also gave the Commission some specific marching orders.\r\n\n          One  such  set of  marching  orders is  conveyed  by 28\r\n\nU.S.C.   994(h), which provides in part:\r\n\n               The  Commission  shall  assure that  the\r\n          guidelines specify  a sentence  to a term  of\r\n          imprisonment  at or  near  the  maximum  term\r\n          authorized  for  categories of  defendants in\r\n          which the defendant is eighteen years old  or\r\n          older and  [has been  convicted of  a violent\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          crime or felony drug offense and has at least\r\n          two such prior convictions].\r\n\nThe  Commission  implemented section  994(h)  through the  Career\r\n\nOffender  Guideline.   See U.S.S.G.   4B1.1,  comment. (backg'd).\r                                    \r\n\nThis  guideline sets  forth  a table  of  enhanced total  offense\r\n\nlevels (TOLs)   said  to be a function of the  \"Offense Statutory\r\n\nMaximum\"   to  be employed  in calculating the  sentences of  so-\r\n\ncalled  \"career offenders.\"  See U.S.S.G.  4B1.1.  A defendant is\r                                          \r\n\nregarded as a career offender  if he was at least eighteen  years\r\n\nold at the time of  the offense of conviction, that offense  is a\r\n\ncrime of violence or a drug-related  felony, and he has two prior\r\n\nconvictions  for drug felonies or  crimes of violence.   See id.;\r                                                                          \r\n\nsee also United States v.  Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 613 n.1  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1118 (1995).\r                             \r\n\n          When   the  Commission   issued  the   Career  Offender\r\n\nGuideline, it coined the  phrase \"Offense Statutory Maximum,\" but\r\n\ndid not define the  phrase beyond saying that \"the  term `Offense\r\n\nStatutory  Maximum' refers  to the  maximum term  of imprisonment\r\n\nauthorized  for the  offense  of conviction.\"   U.S.S.G.   4B1.1,\r\n\ncomment.  (n.2)   (Nov.  1987).     Since  this   definition  was\r\n\ntautological, it proved  unilluminating.   Faced with  a need  to\r\n\nimprovise, several  courts of  appeals concluded that  the phrase\r\n\nencompassed not  merely the  statutory maximum applicable  to the\r\n\noffense  of  conviction   simpliciter,  but  also   the  upgraded\r                                               \r\n\nstatutory maximum that results  after available enhancements  for\r\n\nprior  criminal activity  are  taken into  account.   See  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Smith, 984  F.2d 1084, 1085 (10th Cir.),  cert. denied,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n114 S. Ct.  204 (1993); United States v.  Garrett, 959 F.2d 1005,\r                                                           \r\n\n1009-11  (D.C. Cir. 1992); United  States v. Amis,  926 F.2d 328,\r                                                           \r\n\n329-30  (3d Cir. 1991); United States  v. Sanchez-Lopez, 879 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n541, 558-60 (9th Cir. 1989).  This lexicographical choice carried\r\n\nwith it important consequences; under the courts' construction, a\r\n\ndefendant whose maximum possible term of imprisonment for a crime\r\n\nof violence or  drug offense  was enhanced from,  say, twenty  to\r\n\nthirty  years on account  of prior criminal  activity, netted two\r\n\nadditional offense levels (increasing  his TOL from thirty-two to\r\n\nthirty-four) and found himself in a steeper sentencing range.\r\n\n          In Amendment  506,  the Commission  first  meaningfully\r\n\ndefined the  phrase \"Offense  Statutory Maximum.\"   The amendment\r\n\nprovides  that the phrase, for the purpose of the Career Offender\r\n\nGuideline, \"refers to the maximum term of imprisonment authorized\r\n\nfor  the offense  of conviction  that is a  crime of  violence or\r\n\ncontrolled substance offense, not  including any increase in that\r\n\nmaximum  term  under  a  sentencing  enhancement  provision  that\r\n\napplies  because  of  the  defendant's  prior  criminal  record.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.1, comment.  (n.2) (Nov. 1994).   The amended  note\r\n\noffers the example of a defendant who is subject to  a sentencing\r\n\nenhancement under  21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(C), in which  case \"the\r\n\n`Offense Statutory Maximum' for the purposes of this guideline is\r\n\ntwenty years  and  not thirty  years.\"   Finally, the  Commission\r\n\nopted  to give  Amendment 506  retroactive effect.   See U.S.S.G.\r                                                                  \r\n\n 1B1.10(3) (Nov. 1994).\r\n\n          Initially,  the  Commission  attempted  to  justify the\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\namendment as  \"avoid[ing] unwarranted double-counting as  well as\r\n\nunwarranted disparity associated with  variations in the exercise\r\n\nof prosecutorial discretion  in seeking enhanced penalties  based\r\n\non  prior convictions.\"   U.S.S.G.,  App. C,  Amend. 506,  at 409\r\n\n(Nov. 1994).  In addition, the Commission  observed that Congress\r\n\nenacted the array of  sentence-enhancing laws after the statutory\r\n\npredicate  for the Career Offender Guideline had become law.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.   Subsequently, the Commission attempted to explain its newly\r             \r\n\nemergent interpretation of the Career Offender Guideline in terms\r\n\nof  a  desire  to  avoid  unwarranted  disparity  and  to achieve\r\n\nconsistency.  See  Amendment Notice, 60 Fed.  Reg. 14,054, 14,055\r                           \r\n\n(1995); see also United  States v. LaBonte,  885 F. Supp. 19,  23\r                                                    \r\n\nn.4  (D. Me. 1995).  Whatever may  be its provenance, it is nose-\r\n\non-the-face plain that, in many instances, Amendment 506 produces\r\n\nlower  TOLs   (and,  ultimately,  shorter  sentences)   than  the\r\n\nunembellished Career  Offender Guideline  (as interpreted  by the\r\n\ncourts).    Due to  this palliative  effect,  critics view  it as\r\n\ninimical to congressional intent.1  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1As we have said before, \"irony is no  stranger to the law.\"\r\nAmanullah v.

Throughout\r                             \r\nits history, the Sentencing  Commission has been berated  for the\r\nseverity of  the sentencing outcomes dictated  by the guidelines.\r\nSee, e.g., United  States v.

THE DEFENDANTS\r\n\n          These  four  defendants  all   were  sentenced  in  the\r\n\nDistrict  of  Maine as  career offenders  prior  to the  birth of\r\n\nAmendment  506.  In each instance, the prosecution filed a notice\r\n\nunder 21  U.S.C.    851(a)(1)  signalling its  intention to  seek\r\n\nenhanced  penalties  for prior  convictions,  and the  sentencing\r\n\ncourt arrived  at the defendant's \"Offense  Statutory Maximum\" by\r\n\nfactoring the statutory enhancement into the mix.  The court then\r\n\nset  each defendant's  TOL and  guideline sentencing  range (GSR)\r\n\naccordingly.   Following the  promulgation of the  amendment, all\r\n\nfour defendants tried to  avail themselves of it.  We  limn their\r\n\nindividual circumstances.\r\n\n                       A.

George LaBonte.\r                                                   \r\n\n          A grand jury indicted LaBonte for possession of cocaine\r\n\nwith intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) &amp;\r\n\n(b)(1)(C).  After he pleaded guilty,  the district court (Hornby,\r\n\nU.S.D.J.)  sentenced  him under  the  Career  Offender Guideline.\r\n\nUsing an enhanced statutory maximum derived from LaBonte's record\r\n\nof prior  drug convictions,  Judge  Hornby set  LaBonte's TOL  at\r\n\nthirty-four,  granted  a  three-level  downward   adjustment  for\r\n\nacceptance of  responsibility, see U.S.S.G.  3E1.1,  arrived at a\r                                            \r\n\nGSR of 188-235 months, and sentenced him to serve 188 months.

Judge Hornby  determined that\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nAmendment 506 was valid  and decided to  apply it.  See  LaBonte,\r                                                                          \r\n\n885 F.  Supp. at 24.  He granted LaBonte's motion, focused on the\r\n\nunenhanced statutory maximum to calculate a new TOL (thirty-two),\r\n\nand again deducted three levels for acceptance of responsibility.\r\n\nThis  recomputation yielded a  GSR of  151-188 months,  and Judge\r\n\nHornby  lowered LaBonte's sentence to the nadir of the new range.\r\n\nSee id.

See 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(B), 846; 18  U.S.C.\r                       \r\n\n   924(c)(1).   Utilizing  an enhanced  statutory maximum,  Judge\r\n\nHornby set  Piper's TOL at thirty-seven,  subtracted three levels\r\n\nfor  acceptance of  responsibility, arrived  at a GSR  of 262-327\r\n\nmonths,  and imposed  an incarcerative  sentence of  300 months.2\r\n\nWe affirmed.  See Piper, 35 F.3d at 613.\r                                 \r\n\n          Hot  on  the  heels   of  Amendment  506,  Piper  moved\r\n\nunsuccessfully for  resentencing.  Although  Judge Hornby assumed\r\n\nthe   amendment's  validity,  he  exercised  his  discretion  and\r\n\ndeclined  to permit  Piper to  benefit from  it.3   Piper appeals\r\n\nfrom this disposition.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Piper  received  an additional  five-year  sentence  on the\r\nfirearms count.  That impost is not in issue here.\r\n\n     3The  amendment,  if  applied, would  have  lowered  Piper's\r\nadjusted  offense  level  from  thirty-four  to  thirty-two,  and\r\ndecreased the GSR to 210-262 months.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n                  C.

He thereafter pleaded guilty\r                      \r\n\nto two counts  of possessing controlled substances with intent to\r\n\ndistribute,  and  the  court  (Carter,  U.S.D.J.)  dismissed  the\r\n\nremaining  counts.   Using an  enhanced statutory  maximum, Judge\r\n\nCarter set Hunnewell's TOL  at thirty-four, deducted three levels\r\n\nfor acceptance  of responsibility,  arrived at a  GSR of  188-235\r\n\nmonths,  and sentenced  the defendant  to serve  188 months.   We\r\n\naffirmed.  See  United States v. Hunnewell, 10 F.3d 805 (1st Cir.\r                                                    \r\n\n1993) (table), cert. denied, 114 S.

Judge Carter\r\n\ndenied  this motion,  concluding that  the  Sentencing Commission\r\n\nlacked  the  authority  to   adopt  Amendment  506.4    Hunnewell\r\n\nappeals.\r\n\n                        D.

Consulting the\r\n\nenhanced  statutory  maximum,  Judge  Carter set  Dyer's  TOL  at\r\n\nthirty-four,  refused  an acceptance-of-responsibility  discount,\r\n\narrived at a  GSR of 262-327 months, and  levied a 262-month term\r\n\nof imprisonment.  We affirmed.  See United States v.

Judge Carter  denied and  dismissed the  habeas\r\n\npetition.  Among other things, the judge, declaring Amendment 506\r\n\nto be unlawful, refused  to resentence Dyer.5  Dyer  protests all\r\n\naspects of the district court's order.\r\n\nIII.  THE VALIDITY OF AMENDMENT 506\r          III.  THE VALIDITY OF AMENDMENT 506\r\n\n          We  begin  our analysis  by discussing,  generally, the\r\n\nmethodology we will employ  in examining Amendment 506.   We then\r\n\nproceed  to  tackle  the  two conundrums  that  are  inextricably\r\n\nintertwined with the question of the amendment's validity.\r\n\n                       A.

United  States, 113  S. Ct.  1913, 1915\r                                                  \r\n\n(1993).  Like the  Commission's policy statements, its commentary\r\n\nis  binding on  the federal  courts.   See  id. at  1917-18.   In\r                                                         \r\n\ngeneral, these  interpretive materials  are entitled to  the same\r\n\nsubstantial degree  of deference that courts  routinely accord an\r\n\nadministrative  agency's interpretation  of  its own  legislative\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Amendment  506,  if  applied,  would  have  lowered  Dyer's\r\nadjusted  offense  level  from  thirty-four  to  thirty-two,  and\r\ndecreased his GSR to 210-262 months.\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nrules.  See id. at 1919.  Thus, under Stinson, judicial  scrutiny\r                                                       \r\n\nof the Commission's commentary is limited to ensuring consistency\r\n\nwith  federal statutes  (including,  but not  restricted to,  the\r\n\nCommission's   enabling   statute),  and   with   the  guidelines\r\n\nthemselves.\r\n\n          These  two  lines of  inquiry  proceed along  different\r\n\nanalytic paths.  When  a court ventures to determine  whether the\r\n\nCommission's  commentary tracks  the  guidelines,  the degree  of\r\n\ndeference is  at its zenith.  In  this context, commentary is not\r\n\nmerely  the end  product of  delegated authority  for rulemaking,\r\n\nbut,  rather,  \"explains  the  guidelines  and provides  concrete\r\n\nguidance  as to how even unambiguous guidelines are to be applied\r\n\nin practice.\"  Id. at 1918.  Unless the commentary  is a palpably\r                            \r\n\nerroneous rendition of a  guideline, it merits respect.   See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 1919; Piper, 35 F.3d at 617.\r                        \r\n\n          The  determination  of   whether  the  guidelines   are\r\n\nconsistent with positive statutory  law touches a more vulnerable\r\n\nspot.    That  inquiry  implicates  the  traditional  process  of\r\n\nreviewing agency rules typified  by the Supreme Court's watershed\r\n\nopinion  in  Chevron U.S.A.  Inc.  v.  Natural Resources  Defense\r                                                                           \r\n\nCouncil, Inc., 467  U.S. 837 (1984).   Thus, while the  Court has\r                       \r\n\nwarned  that  Chevron does  not provide  an  apt analogy  for the\r                               \r\n\nprocess of reviewing the  relationship between commentary, on the\r\n\none hand, and guidelines,  on the other hand, see Stinson, 113 S.\r                                                                   \r\n\nCt.  at 1918,  we believe  that Chevron  deference is  the proper\r                                                 \r\n\ncriterion  for  determining whether  a  guideline  (or, for  that\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nmatter, commentary that suggests how a guideline should be  read)\r\n\ncontravenes a statute.   The Chevron two-step  approach fits that\r                                              \r\n\ntype of inquiry  like a glove.6  See Chevron,  467 U.S. at 842-43\r                                                      \r\n\n(describing two-step test).\r\n\n          Applying  this   methodology   here  is   not   without\r\n\ncomplications.  We limit our inquiry  to the fit (or lack of fit)\r\n\nbetween the Career Offender  Guideline as explicated in Amendment\r\n\n506 and  the applicable statute,  28 U.S.C.    994(h).7   In that\r\n\nstatute, Congress directed the  Commission to ensure that certain\r\n\nrecidivists receive  sentences \"at  or  near the  maximum.\"   The\r\n\nCareer Offender Guideline represents the Commission's response to\r\n\nthis  directive.    See  U.S.S.G.   4B1.1,  comment.   (backg'd).\r                                 \r\n\nBecause the Commission's  understanding of its  statutory mandate\r\n\nmust  be  measured against  the  Chevron  benchmark, the  inquiry\r                                                  \r\n\nfollows a familiar format:\r\n\n               When   a   court  reviews   an  agency's\r\n          construction   of   the   statute  which   it\r\n          administers,  it  is   confronted  with   two\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6We  note in passing  the suggestion  by some  scholars that\r\nStinson implies an extraordinarily deferential standard of review\r                 \r\nfor the  entire process of  evaluating guideline commentary.   On\r\nthis view, commentary  should be honored unless  it constitutes a\r\nplainly erroneous interpretation  either of a  guideline or of  a\r\nstatute.  See  1 Kenneth Culp Davis  and Richard J.  Pierce, Jr.,\r                       \r\nAdministrative Law  Treatise   6.10,  at 284  (3d ed. 1994).   We\r                                      \r\nneed not  probe this  possibility today.   Because Amendment  506\r\npasses  muster under  the  Chevron test,  it  would clearly  pass\r                                            \r\nmuster if we were  to employ the more deferential  test suggested\r\nby Professors Davis and Pierce.\r\n\n     7Because the government does  not contend that Amendment 506\r\nis  inconsistent  with  the   guideline  itself,  we  eschew  any\r\ndiscussion of that point.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n1, 17 (1st Cir.)

The  first\r                                                 \r\n\napplication combines  two issues; it concerns  the explication of\r\n\nthe word \"maximum\" as  that word is  used in section 994(h)  and,\r\n\nconcomitantly,  the  meaning of  the  word  \"categories\" as  used\r\n\ntherein.   The second occasion  for Chevron analysis  involves an\r                                                     \r\n\nexegesis of the phrase \"at or near\" as used in the same sentence.\r\n\nThe  two  problems  are   interrelated,  but  they  are  somewhat\r\n\ndifferent in nature.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Although  we  are   mindful  that  plausible  if   strained\r\ninterpretations of  a series of individual  statutory terms might\r\nat times lead  to an  impermissible overall  interpretation of  a\r\nstatute, that is  not the case  here.  Whether  one conducts  the\r\nensuing analysis in one segment or two, the result is unaffected;\r\nthe  simple fact  of  the  matter  is  that  the  Commission  has\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\n                     B.  The First Conundrum.\r                               B.  The First Conundrum.\r                                                      \r\n\n          In the context of section 994(h), the term \"maximum\" is\r\n\nsusceptible  of  divergent  meanings,  depending,   in  part,  on\r\n\nprecisely  what constitutes  a \"categor[y]  of defendants.\"   One\r\n\npossible  reading  is that  \"categories\"  are  composed of  those\r\n\ndefendants  charged with  violations of similar  statutes against\r\n\nwhom prosecutors have filed notices of intention to seek sentence\r\n\nenhancements (e.g., all repeat  offender drug traffickers against\r\n\nwhom  the government  has  filed sentence-enhancing  informations\r\n\nunder  21  U.S.C.    851(a)(1)).    On  this  view, the  relevant\r\n\nstatutory maximum  for any such  defendant would be  the enhanced\r\n\nstatutory  maximum (ESM) applicable to repeat  offenders.  See 21\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.      841(b)(1),  851(a)(1).    But  this  reading  is  not\r\n\nlinguistically compelled.  The word \"categories\" plausibly can be\r\n\ndefined more  broadly to  include all  offenders  (or all  repeat\r\n\noffenders) charged with transgressing  the same criminal statute,\r\n\nregardless  of  whether the  prosecution  chooses  to invoke  the\r\n\nsentence-enhancing  mechanism  against  a   particular  defendant\r\n\n(e.g.,  all  drug  traffickers,   or  all  repeat  offender  drug\r\n\ntraffickers,  who   are  charged  with  violating   21  U.S.C.   \r\n\n841(a)(1)).    On this  view, the  word  \"maximum\" refers  to the\r\n\nunenhanced statutory  maximum (USM),  see 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1),\r                                                   \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ndeveloped a reasonable interpretation  of the vague and ambiguous\r\nlanguage of section  994(h).   That said, we  employ a  piecemeal\r\napproach here, as we believe it  better illustrates that U.S.S.G.\r\n 4B1.1,  as   interpreted  by   the  amended  commentary,   is  a\r\npermissible  construction  of  Congress's  directive  that career\r\noffenders be sentenced \"at or near the maximum term authorized.\"\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nsince this represents the highest possible sentence applicable to\r\n\nall defendants in the category.9\r\n\n          Since the sentencing guidelines must  comport with such\r\n\nspecific  statutory  directives  as  Congress  has ordained,  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 786 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"It\r                                    \r\n\nis  apodictic that  the sentencing  guidelines cannot  sweep more\r\n\nbroadly  than   Congress'  grant  of  power   to  the  Sentencing\r\n\nCommission  permits.\"),  the  question  becomes  whether Congress\r\n\nclearly intended to prefer one  of these interpretations over the\r\n\nother.   The  issue is not  free from  doubt.   Several courts of\r\n\nappeals have  heretofore read  the word  \"maximum\" in  the former\r\n\nfashion (as referring to the ESM), see supra pp. 5-6, whereas the\r                                                      \r\n\nSentencing  Commission now reads the word in the latter sense (as\r\n\nreferring to the USM).   We proceed to test this conflict  in the\r\n\nChevron crucible.\r                 \r\n\n          1.  Step One:  Congressional Intent.  At the outset, we\r                    1.  Step One:  Congressional Intent.\r                                                       \r\n\nmust  determine  whether  Congress  has  spoken  with  sufficient\r\n\nclarity  to  foreclose  alternative interpretations.    Statutory\r\n\nconstruction  always starts     and  sometimes  ends    with  the\r\n\nstatute's  text.  Here, we find Congress's handiwork opaque.  The\r\n\nproblem is not  ambiguity in  definition.  Rather,  it is  simply\r\n\nunclear from the bare  language of the law which maxima  and what\r\n\ncategories Congress had in mind when it contrived section 994(h).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9The relevance of this  somewhat arid discussion will become\r\nmore  apparent in  Part III(C),  infra, when  the need  arises to\r                                                \r\ndetermine  the  extent to  which sentences  are  \"at or  near the\r\nmaximum.\"\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n          The earlier  cases relating  the word \"maximum\"  to the\r\n\nESM do not dictate a contrary conclusion.  Those courts envisaged\r\n\ntheir primary task as interpreting the meaning of the guidelines,\r\n\nsee, e.g.,  Garrett,  959  F.2d at  1010  (concluding  that  \"the\r                             \r\n\nGuidelines  require us  to  define the  [term] Offense  Statutory\r\n\nMaximum\" in a particular way); Amis, 926 F.2d at 329 (stating the\r                                             \r\n\ncourt's  task as  \"merely [to]  determine the  `Offense Statutory\r\n\nMaximum'  as used in guidelines  4B1.1\"), and they did so without\r\n\nthe aid of  Amendment 506.   Although two  courts suggested  that\r\n\nreading \"Offense Statutory Maximum\" as referring to the ESM would\r\n\nbetter effectuate congressional intent,  see Garrett, 959 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n1010; Sanchez-Lopez,  879 F.2d at  559, neither  of these  courts\r                             \r\n\nheld   or even  hinted   that section 994(h) thwarted a different\r\n\nreading.   We have  found no  indication that  any of  the courts\r\n\nwhich  scrutinized the  unexplicated version  of U.S.S.G.   4B1.1\r\n\ndetected the  kind of clear, overarching  congressional directive\r\n\nthat would suffice to abort a Chevron inquiry.\r                                               \r\n\n          Even  were we  to believe  otherwise,   two abecedarian\r\n\nprinciples  of statutory  construction nonetheless  would counsel\r\n\ncontinuation of the Chevron  journey.  First, courts that  read a\r                                     \r\n\nstatute without the aid of an authoritative interpretation by the\r\n\nagency  charged with  administering  the  statute must  reexamine\r\n\ntheir  reading if  the agency  later  speaks to  the point.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nInternational  Ass'n   of  Bridge,  Structural,   and  Ornamental\r                                                                           \r\n\nIronworkers, Etc. v. NLRB,  946 F.2d 1264, 1271 (7th  Cir. 1991).\r                                   \r\n\nSecond,  an agency that  is charged with  administering a statute\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nremains free  to supplant prior judicial  interpretations of that\r\n\nstatute  as long  as the  agency interpretation  is a  reasonable\r\n\nrendition of the statutory text.   See id. at 1270; see also Rust\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 186-87 (1991) (holding that an agency\r                      \r\n\nis  free to reverse its own previous interpretation of a statute,\r\n\nsubject  to  the  same condition);  Strickland,  48  F.3d  at 318\r                                                        \r\n\n(same).  Hence, we trek onward.\r\n\n          When the plain meaning of a law is not readily apparent\r\n\non its  face, the  next  resort is  to the  traditional tools  of\r\n\nstatutory   construction     reviewing  legislative  history  and\r\n\nscrutinizing statutory  structure and  design    in an  effort to\r\n\nshed light on Congress's intent.10\r\n\n          As  originally  envisioned, section  994(h)  would have\r\n\nplaced  the onus of imposing  sentences \"at or  near the maximum\"\r\n\ndirectly  on sentencing  judges.   See S.  Rep. No.  98-225, 98th\r                                                \r\n\nCong., 2d Sess. 175 (1984), reprinted  in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182,\r                                                   \r\n\n3358.

See, e.g.,  Strickland, 48\r                                                                       \r\nF.3d at 19.

But  that proposal did  not take\r\n\nwing;  the Senate  Judiciary Committee  instead approved  section\r\n\n994(h)  in its  current  incarnation.   This version,  unlike the\r\n\nrejected proposal,  addresses its command to  the Commission, not\r\n\nthe  courts.  The  Committee obviously believed  that this change\r\n\nwould  better \"assure  consistent and rational  implementation of\r\n\nthe  Committee's view  that  substantial prison  terms should  be\r\n\nimposed on  repeat violent offenders and  repeat drug offenders.\"\r\n\nS. Rep.  No. 98-225, supra, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 3358.  We think\r                                    \r\n\nthat this  history confirms that (1) in  creating the Commission,\r\n\nCongress had an overall goal of curtailing judicial discretion in\r\n\nsentencing matters; and (2)  in enacting section 994(h), Congress\r\n\nhad  a specific  intent  to let  the  Commission (as  opposed  to\r\n\nindividual judges)  determine the  best method for  assuring that\r\n\ncareer offenders would receive stiff prison sentences.  Past this\r\n\npoint,  the  legislative archives  offer  no clue  as  to whether\r\n\nCongress ever  recognized either  the potential ambiguity  of the\r\n\nterm  \"maximum\"  or the  uncertainty  that  might attach  to  the\r\n\nquestion of what constitutes a category of offenders.\r\n\n          Finding the  relevant  legislative  history  to  be  no\r\n\nclearer  than  the  statute's  text,  we  look  to  the  enabling\r\n\nlegislation and  the overall  structure of the  Sentencing Reform\r\n\nAct for  what  insights they  may afford.   Superficially,  these\r\n\nconsiderations seem to support the government's position that the\r\n\n\"maximum\" is the  ESM.  Reading  \"categories\" narrowly enough  to\r\n\ndistinguish  between offenders on the basis of whether the United\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nStates  Attorney has filed sentence-enhancing informations yields\r\n\npotentially harsher  sentences in those cases,  thereby promising\r\n\nmore stringent  punishment for  selected repeat offenders.   That\r\n\nnarrow  reading also preserves  the distinction between offenders\r\n\nwho are subject to sentence enhancements based  on prior criminal\r\n\nactivity  and those  who are  not    a distinction  that Congress\r\n\narguably  delivered into the hands of prosecutors.  See, e.g., 21\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.    841(b)(1), 851(a)(1).\r\n\n          Although these asseverations  put the government's best\r\n\nfoot forward, they are at most debating points in relation to the\r\n\nproblem  at hand.  They neither indicate that Congress has spoken\r\n\ndirectly to  the precise issue  nor reflect a  sufficiently clear\r\n\ncongressional   intent   to    circumscribe   the    Commission's\r\n\ninterpretive  powers.   Indeed, the  arguments are  circular; the\r\n\ntouted  advantages  of  the  government's reading  appear  to  be\r\n\nadvantageous  only  if  one   assumes  the  conclusion  that  the\r\n\ngovernment is struggling to prove.\r\n\n          We will not add hues to  a rainbow.  Because we find no\r\n\nclear congressional  directive regarding the meaning  of the term\r\n\n\"maximum\" as that  term is  used in section  994(h), our  inquiry\r\n\nproceeds to the second half of the Chevron two-step.\r                                                    \r\n\n          2.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nStrickland,  48 F.3d at 21.

The statute explicitly refers to  \"categories of\r\n\ndefendants,\" namely,  repeat  violent criminals  and repeat  drug\r\n\noffenders,  and does  not suggest  that each  individual offender\r\n\nmust  receive the  highest sentence  available against him.   The\r\n\nCareer Offender  Guideline, read  through the prism  of Amendment\r\n\n506,  adopts an  entirely  plausible version  of the  categorical\r\n\napproach  that the statute suggests.   Unless one  is prepared to\r\n\nwrite off Congress's choice of the word \"categories\" as some sort\r\n\nof linguistic accident  or awkward locution    and we are not  so\r\n\ninclined   this approach is eminently supportable.\r\n\n          Our  dissenting  colleague  decries   the  Commission's\r\n\ncategorical  approach.

The most salient of these restraints is the requirement\r\n\nof  sentencing consistency.    See  28  U.S.C.     994(f).    The\r                                            \r\n\nCommission  adverted to  this concern  in promulgating  Amendment\r\n\n506, see  U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend.  506, at 409 (Nov.  1994), and\r                  \r\n\nresponded to  it by  taking a categorical  approach.   Similarly,\r\n\nCongress's efforts  to  eliminate sentencing  disparities can  be\r\n\nreconciled   with  section   994(h)'s  exhortation   for  maximal\r\n\nsentencing only if one hears  that exhortation as being addressed\r\n\nto  categories  of  defendants.    In  the  final  analysis,  the\r\n\nCommission remains fully faithful  to the welter of congressional\r\n\ncommands  by   choosing  to  treat  repeat   offenders  as  broad\r\n\ncategories  of defendants  and thereby  harmonizing the  call for\r\n\nstringent punishment of recidivists with the call for consistent,\r\n\nnon-disparate sentences.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\n          The  government lodges  two further  objections to  the\r\n\nplausibility of  the Commission's rationale.   First, it contends\r\n\nthat  Congress,  by  means  of  such  statutes  as  21  U.S.C.   \r\n\n851(a)(1),  intended  to give  prosecutors  commodious discretion\r\n\nover  the  potential  sentences  of repeat  offenders,  and  that\r\n\nAmendment 506  frustrates this intent.  Though the government may\r\n\nwell be correct  in asserting  that Congress did  not create  the\r\n\nSentencing   Commission   with   an   eye    toward   eradicating\r\n\nprosecutorial  abuses, it  does not  follow that  Congress strove\r\n\naffirmatively  to give  prosecutors  the keys  to the  kingdom.11\r\n\nWhat is  more, it makes very little sense to impute to Congress a\r\n\nyearning for  unbridled prosecutorial discretion  when two  major\r\n\ngoals of  sentencing reform  were to  \"assure that sentences  are\r\n\nfair  both to the  offender and to society,\"  S. Rep. No. 98-225,\r\n\nsupra,  1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 3222,  and to  \"avoid[] unwarranted\r               \r\n\nsentencing disparities among defendants  with similar records who\r\n\nhave been found guilty of similar criminal conduct.\"  28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n991(b)(1)(B).\r\n\n          The   government's   remaining    objection   to    the\r\n\nCommission's reading of  the word \"maximum\" is  that this reading\r\n\nprescribes  an identical  sentencing range  for  repeat offenders\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11The  government makes  much of  the fact  that the  Senate\r\nJudiciary Committee,  in creating the Commission,  disclaimed any\r\nfear that the  guidelines would increase  prosecutors' discretion\r\nto  reduce sentences through plea bargains.   See S. Rep. No. 98-\r                                                           \r\n225,  supra,   1984  U.S.C.C.A.N.   at  3246.     But  Congress's\r                     \r\nexplanation  (which  stressed  that  the  Commission could  guard\r\nagainst this phenomenon because it was empowered to  issue policy\r\nstatements concerning the  review of plea bargains, see  id.), is\r                                                                      \r\nindicative of the latitude it intended to give to the Commission.\r                                                                          \r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nwhether or  not the  prosecution  has sought  to obtain  sentence\r\n\nenhancements.   This  reading, the  government says,  effectively\r\n\neliminates  prosecutorial  enhancements  and arrogates  unto  the\r\n\nCommission the  authority that Congress explicitly  vested in the\r\n\nUnited States Attorney.  We find this polemic unpersuasive.\r\n\n          We  take   21  U.S.C.     841(b)(1)  as  our  point  of\r\n\ndeparture.   This  section establishes  unenhanced  maximum terms\r\n\napplicable to all violators, enhanced maximum terms applicable to\r\n\ncertain repeat  offenders, and, in some  cases, mandatory minimum\r\n\nterms  of   incarceration  (enhanced  or  unenhanced).     It  is\r\n\nelementary that  any guideline  which prescribes a  sentence that\r\n\nfalls within these parameters does not conflict with the statute.\r\n\nWhat remains is a policy choice, and the Commission, by opting to\r\n\nemphasize the USM, has done no more than exercise its prerogative\r\n\nto make precisely this  kind of policy choice.   See Chevron, 467\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 864.\r\n\n          Furthermore, the choice is  not unreasonable.  The root\r\n\npurpose of the Career Offender  Guideline, U.S.S.G.  4B1.1, is to\r\n\nenhance repeat offenders' sentences.   The revamped guideline not\r\n\nonly accomplishes  that purpose but also  coheres with Congress's\r\n\ndiscernible  aims in  making enhanced  penalties  available under\r\n\nsection 841.   While that statute establishes a possible enhanced\r                                                                  \r\n\npenalty for  repeat offenders  if prosecutors choose,  the Career\r\n\nOffender Guideline, as filtered through Amendment 506, ensures an\r\n\nactual enhancement of  the TOL  for all repeat  offenders.   This\r                \r\n\ncritical  distinction belies  the  government's lament  that  the\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\namendment  sounds  a death  knell  for  enhancements required  by\r\n\nstatute.    The  guideline,   section  4B1.1,  as  explicated  by\r\n\nAmendment 506, departs from the statute, section 841, only in the\r\n\nsense that the former  seeks to enhance the sentences  of a wider\r\n\nclass  of recidivists.   This departure lacks  significance.  For\r\n\npurposes of  testing the  fidelity of the  sentencing guidelines'\r\n\ncareer  offender  provisions  to  the  statutory  scheme,  it  is\r\n\nirrelevant that some sentences  beyond those mandated by Congress\r\n\nare also enhanced.\r\n\n          When all is said and done, the Commission's decision to\r\n\ntreat  the word  \"maximum\"  as meaning  the unenhanced  statutory\r\n\nmaximum applicable  to a category of  offenders, broadly defined,\r\n\nis a plausible rendition  of section 994(h).   We must honor  the\r\n\nCommission's definition.\r\n\n                    C.  The Second Conundrum.\r                              C.  The Second Conundrum.\r                                                      \r\n\n          As  we  have   previously  explained,  section   994(h)\r\n\ncontains a  specific  directive  that,  in  the  case  of  career\r\n\noffenders, sentences ought  to be  \"at or near  the maximum  term\r\n\nauthorized.\"  The government contends that, regardless of how the\r\n\nword \"maximum\" is construed, Amendment  506 is invalid because it\r\n\nfails  to produce sentences that are \"at or near\" any conceivable\r\n\nmaximum.  As before,  we measure this contention by  wielding the\r\n\nChevron yardstick.\r                 \r\n\n          1.  Step One:   Congressional Intent.   At the risk  of\r                    1.  Step One:   Congressional Intent.\r                                                        \r\n\nbelaboring the obvious,  we start  from the premise  that \"at  or\r\n\nnear\"  is neither  an exact  nor a  self-defining term.   Section\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\n994(h) is  silent  as to  how  \"near\" sentences  must  be to  the\r\n\nmaximum, and  the legislative history is  singularly unhelpful on\r\n\nthis point.  Especially since  we must concentrate on the USM  in\r\n\ncalculating how \"near\" the  Commission's sentencing ranges are to\r\n\nthe  statutory  goal, see  supra Part  III(B),  we are  unable to\r                                          \r\n\ndivine a sufficiently  clear expression of  congressional intent.\r\n\nThus,  we quickly move to the second    and decisive   portion of\r\n\nthe Chevron query.\r                     \r\n\n          2.    Step  Two:    Plausibility  of  the  Commission's\r                    2.    Step  Two:    Plausibility  of  the  Commission's\r                                                                           \r\n\nInterpretation.  The question  of plausibility reduces to whether\r          Interpretation.\r                        \r\n\nthe  Career  Offender  Guideline,   as  now  interpreted  by  the\r\n\nCommission,  sufficiently   ensures  sentences  that   satisfy  a\r\n\nreasonable construction of  \"at or  near the maximum.\"   In  this\r\n\nsetting, deference to the  Commission is especially  appropriate.\r\n\n\"At  or near\" is an inherently variable phrase.  In speaking with\r\n\na Texan, one  might say that Providence is \"near\"  Boston, but it\r\n\nis doubtful if that  description would (or could) be  employed in\r\n\nspeaking with  a resident of, say, Cambridge or Cranston.  In all\r\n\nevents, the phrase  \"at or  near,\" as employed  in this  statute,\r\n\nsuggests  a  continuum  of  various  sentences,  each  relatively\r\n\nfurther from, or closer to, the statutory maximum.\r\n\n          It  is  also important  to  recognize  that the  career\r\n\noffender  enhancement is not the end point of the sentencing road\r\n\nand,  by  itself,   does  not   dictate  individual   defendants'\r\n\nsentences.  Once the \"Offense Statutory Maximum\" derived from the\r\n\nCareer Offender  Guideline functions to yield  a defendant's TOL,\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nthe sentencing court  must then make  a myriad of  individualized\r\n\nadjustments to the offense level, up or down, for factors such as\r\n\nacceptance  of responsibility  see U.S.S.G.   3E1.1, role  in the\r                                            \r\n\noffense, see U.S.S.G.   3B1.1,  3B1.2, and the like.   It is only\r                      \r\n\nwhen all  the  component parts  of  the sentencing  equation  are\r\n\npulled  together that  the  court  can  ascertain  the  range  of\r\n\npermissible  sentences  and,  hence,   settle  upon  the   actual\r\n\nsentence.   Even then, the  court retains authority,  at least in\r\n\ncertain  circumstances,  to  depart   downward  if  a  particular\r\n\ndefendant furnishes substantial  assistance in the  investigation\r\n\nor prosecution  of another person  who has committed  an offense,\r\n\nsee 18 U.S.C.   3553(e); U.S.S.G.  5K1.1, or to depart in  either\r             \r\n\ndirection if aggravating or mitigating circumstances warrant, see\r                                                                           \r\n\n18  U.S.C.   3553(b); U.S.S.G.  5K2.0.  Many of these prospective\r\n\nadjustments derive from explicit  statutory commands.

First and foremost, given\r\n\nthe labyrinthine way in  which repeat offenders' actual sentences\r\n\nare constructed,  heightened deference to the  Commission's slant\r\n\non  the \"at  or near\"  language  is very  desirable.

In other\r\n\nwords,  due to  the interstitial  nature of  the  career offender\r\n\ncalculation, a  reviewing court  should be generous  in assessing\r\n\nthe reasonableness  of  the  Commission's  approximation  of  how\r\n\n\"near\" is \"near.\"\r\n\n          The fact  that the career offender  adjustment does not\r\n\nitself  directly  determine  any  particular  defendant's  actual\r\n\nsentence has other  implications as well.  Unless one is ready to\r\n\nplace any and all downward adjustments beyond a repeat offender's\r\n\nreach    and even  the government does  not espouse so  extreme a\r\n\nposition   it  is surpassingly difficult  (if not impossible)  to\r\n\nexpect the Commission to  write a rule which ensures  that career\r\n\noffenders  will invariably  receive sentences  \"at or  near\" each\r\n\nindividual's ESM.  Once a sentencing court has made such downward\r\n\nadjustments, it would be surprising if many defendants' sentences\r\n\ncame very near to  the statutorily prescribed \"maximum\" penalties\r\n\nthat are theoretically available  (however the word \"maximum\" may\r\n\nbe  defined).   By  like token,  the  very real  possibility that\r\n\nupward  adjustments  to  the   TOL  may  make  career  offenders'\r\n\nsentences  more severe suggests that room should be left for play\r\n\nin  the  joints as  the Commission  implements  the \"at  or near\"\r\n\nlanguage.\r\n\n          Mindful,  as we  are, of  these complexities,  we think\r\n\nthat  Amendment 506 passes muster.  The sentences available under\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nthe  newly  explicated  Career Offender  Guideline  constitute  a\r\n\nsubstantial  proportion of  the possible  sentences permitted  by\r\n\nstatute.   We can conveniently illustrate  the point by reference\r\n\nto the  four defendants who  are involved in  these appeals.   By\r\n\noperation of  Amendment 506, defendants  like LaBonte, Hunnewell,\r\n\nand Dyer now face maximum sentences of 262 months (the top of the\r\n\nrecalculated GSR) before taking  into account any  individualized\r\n\nadjustments.  A  262-month sentence represents 109.2% of  the USM\r\n\nfor  these defendants'  offense  of conviction.12    On the  same\r\n\nbasis, a defendant like Piper now faces a maximum sentence of 365\r\n\nmonths  (76%  of the  applicable USM).    Examining the  gamut of\r\n\npossible  sentences   available  against  each   defendant  under\r\n\nAmendment 506,  the median  sentence in  the range applicable  to\r\n\nLaBonte, Hunnewell,  and Dyer  (236 months) constitutes  98.3% of\r\n\nthe  USM, while  the median  sentence in  the range  pertinent to\r\n\nPiper (294.5 months)  constitutes 61.4%  of the USM.   Under  any\r\n\nsuitable definition  of  the word  \"near,\"  we believe  that  the\r\n\nCommission  could  reasonably  conclude  that  these  percentages\r\n\nensure sentences sufficiently close to the USM   and sufficiently\r\n\nharsh   to provide  a fair approximation of Congress's  desire to\r\n\nsee that career offenders,  as a group, receive maximal  terms of\r\n\nimprisonment.\r\n\nIV.  THE APPLICATION OF AMENDMENT 506\r          IV.  THE APPLICATION OF AMENDMENT 506\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12We think that this calculation graphically illustrates the\r\nfallacy underlying our dissenting brother's lament that Amendment\r\n506,  \"effectively nullifies  the  criminal history  enhancements\r\ncarefully enacted in statutes like 21 U.S.C.   841.\"  See post at\r                                                                        \r\n42.\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n          Having  determined  that  Amendment  506  is  a  lawful\r\n\nexercise of  the Sentencing  Commission's powers, we  now address\r\n\nthe motions for resentencing.\r\n\n          The principles governing motions to resentence based on\r\n\nnewly emergent guideline amendments can be compactly  catalogued.\r\n\nWhen the Commission amends  the guidelines (or its interpretation\r\n\nof the guidelines)  in a  manner that favors  defendants, it  may\r\n\ninvite retrospective  application  of the  new  interpretation.13\r\n\nIn such an event, a defendant who believes that the amendment, if\r\n\nin  force  earlier,  would have  reduced  his  GSR  may move  for\r\n\nresentencing.  The district court, \"after considering the factors\r\n\nset  forth in  section  3553(a)  to  the  extent  that  they  are\r\n\napplicable,\"  may reduce  the sentence  \"if such  a  reduction is\r\n\nconsistent with  the applicable  policy statements issued  by the\r\n\nSentencing  Commission.\"   18  U.S.C.    3582(c)(2).14   The  law\r\n\npermits, but does not  require, the district court  to resentence\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13For  this   purpose,   an  \"amendment\"   differs  from   a\r\n\"clarification.\"  Clarifications explain  earlier editions of the\r\nsentencing  guidelines;  they  do  not  change  those provisions.\r\nBecause they are retrospective by nature, they do not require any\r\nspecial  retroactivity designation.  See  U.S.S.G.  1B1.11(b)(2);\r                                                  \r\nsee also United States v. LaCroix, 28 F.3d 223, 227 n.4 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n1994).   In contrast, amendments do  change prior guidelines and,\r\nif they are to  be given retroactive effect, the  Commission must\r\nso specify.   See 28  U.S.C.    994(u); U.S.S.G.   1B1.10.   This\r                           \r\nopinion  deals   exclusively  with  amendments   as  opposed   to\r\nclarifications.\r\n\n     14The factors  set forth in section 3553(a), insofar as they\r\nare arguably applicable to any of the instant defendants, include\r\nthe  nature and  circumstances  of the  offense, the  defendant's\r\ncriminal past, the GSRs,  the Commission's policy statements, and\r\nthe  necessity  of  avoiding  unwarranted  sentencing disparities\r\namong similarly situated defendants.  See 18 U.S.C.   3553(a).\r                                                   \r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nsuch a defendant.   See United States  v.

It is plain  that, under this\r\n\nparadigm,  most resentencing battles will  be won or  lost in the\r\n\ndistrict court, not in an appellate venue.\r\n\n          With  this  brief  preface,  we  reach  the  individual\r\n\ndefendants' cases.\r\n\n                       A.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nLaBonte, 885 F.  Supp. at  24.  Although  the government  appeals\r                 \r\n\nfrom  the reconfigured  sentence,  it challenges  only the  lower\r\n\ncourt's   validation  of   the   reinterpreted  Career   Offender\r\n\nGuideline.    Because the  government  has  neither asserted  nor\r\n\nargued a claim that the  court abused its considerable discretion\r\n\nin reducing LaBonte's sentence, we must affirm the judgment.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States v.

Piper.\r                                                   \r\n\n          In Piper's  case, the district  court upheld  Amendment\r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\n506  but  refused  to  mitigate  the  original  sentence.   Piper\r\n\nproffers a potpourri of protests to the court's ruling.  Only two\r\n\nof them warrant discussion.\r\n\n          First, Piper suggests that under 18 U.S.C.   3582(c)(2)\r\n\na district court may only decide whether  the policies underlying\r\n\nan  amendment  would be  served by  a  lessened sentence.   Piper\r\n\nmisreads  the  statute:   it  authorizes  the  district judge  to\r\n\nresentence  when resentencing  is  consistent  with the  policies\r\n\nunderlying  the amendment, but it neither compels the judge to do\r\n\nso nor limits his inquiry to the consistency question.  Since the\r\n\nlanguage is  precatory rather than mandatory,  the district court\r\n\nneed  not  even  consider  the policy  statements  supporting  an\r\n\namendment  if,  \"after considering  the  factors set  forth  in  \r\n\n3553(a)  to  the  extent  they  are  applicable,\"   18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n3582(c)(2), the court prefers to stand by the existing sentence.\r\n\n          Piper's  next remonstrance  suggests that  the district\r\n\ncourt  failed  to  reweigh  the  factors  delineated  in  section\r\n\n3553(a),  see supra  note 14,  and that,  therefore, the  court's\r                             \r\n\ndecision  cannot   constitute  a  proper   exercise  of  judicial\r\n\ndiscretion.   The  problem  with this  remonstrance  lies in  its\r\n\npremise.   The district judge presided over Piper's case from the\r\n\noutset.  He possessed great familiarity with the odious nature of\r\n\nthe offense of conviction (leading  a \"commando-style\" raid on  a\r\n\nfamily's home while heavily  armed, and searching for a  stash of\r\n\nillegal drugs supposedly secreted there).  Having sentenced Piper\r\n\noriginally,  he knew  the  intimate details  of Piper's  criminal\r\n\n                                33\r\r\n\nhistory.  At  the hearing on the motion  to resentence, the judge\r\n\nlistened to arguments  that zeroed  in on the  very factors  that\r\n\nPiper now claims were overlooked.\r\n\n          In the end, Piper's argument invites us to elevate form\r\n\nover substance.   We decline the invitation.  Where,  as here, it\r\n\nis  clear that  the sentencing  judge has considered  the section\r\n\n3553(a) factors, we will not interpose a further requirement that\r\n\nhe make  explicit findings as to  each and all of  those factors.\r\n\nSee United States  v. Savoie, 985  F.2d 612, 618 (1st  Cir. 1993)\r                                      \r\n\n(holding that a  district court need  not make explicit  findings\r\n\nregarding  the statutory factors  relevant to  restitution orders\r\n\n\"so long  as the  record on appeal  reveals that  the judge  made\r\n\nimplicit   findings   or   otherwise   adequately   evinced   his\r\n\nconsideration of  those factors\");  United States v.

On  this record,  it strains  credulity to\r\n\nsuggest  that the  district court  neglected to  take account  of\r\n\nstatutorily required items in its decisionmaking process.\r\n\n                  C.

Having concluded  that the lower court erred,  see supra\r                                                                           \r\n\nPart  III, we  ordinarily would  remand for  further proceedings.\r\n\n                                34\r\r\n\nBut  the government has other ideas; it asserts that the district\r\n\ncourt's order should  be construed as an  exercise of discretion,\r\n\nand it asks us  to affirm the denial of  Hunnewell's resentencing\r\n\nrequest on this basis.\r\n\n          After  a  painstaking  examination  of  the  record, we\r\n\nreject the government's asseveration.  Calling a horse a cow does\r\n\nnot  yield  milk.   Indeed, the  government tacitly  concedes the\r\n\nweakness of  its position by forgoing  developed argumentation on\r\n\nthis  point  and instead  regaling us  with  the reasons  why the\r\n\ndistrict  could  (or should)  have  declined to  extend  an olive\r\n\nbranch  to  Hunnewell.    The fact  remains,  however,  that  the\r\n\ndiscretion  conferred  by  18  U.S.C.     3582(c)(2)  is for  the\r\n\ndistrict  court    not  this court     to exercise  in  the first\r\n\ninstance.   Consequently,  the denial  of Hunnewell's  motion for\r\n\nresentencing must be set aside and the cause remanded for further\r\n\nconsideration of that motion.\r\n\n          Before  leaving  Hunnewell's  situation,  we  pause  to\r\n\ncomment on the government's suggestion that,  because Hunnewell's\r\n\noriginal sentence was still within the post-amendment GSR (albeit\r\n\nbarely),  we need not afford the district court an opportunity to\r\n\ndecide whether to resentence him.15\r\n\n          In its haste to  validate this argument, the government\r\n\ndistorts our holding in United States v.

So it is here.  In Hunnewell's initial sentencing\r             \r\n\nhearing, both the government  and the defense asked the  court to\r\n\nimpose  a sentence at the bottom of  the GSR.

A  district court  may\r\n\ndismiss a  section 2255  petition without holding  an evidentiary\r\n\nhearing if  it plainly appears on the  face of the pleadings that\r\n\nthe petitioner is not entitled to the requested relief, or if the\r\n\n                                36\r\r\n\nallegations, although adequate on their face, consist of no  more\r\n\nthan conclusory  prognostications and  perfervid rhetoric,  or if\r\n\nthe  key factual  averments  on which  the  petition depends  are\r\n\neither inherently improbable or contradicted by established facts\r\n\nof record.   See United States  v. McGill, 11 F.3d  223, 225 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1993); see also 28 U.S.C.   2255 (explaining  that a hearing\r                              \r\n\nis  unnecessary  when the  record  \"conclusively  shows that  the\r\n\nprisoner is entitled to no relief\").\r\n\n          We believe  that Dyer's petition is  both generally and\r\n\nspecifically defective.  Taking  first things first, the district\r\n\ncourt noted that  Dyer had not presented  his factual allegations\r\n\nunder  oath,  and that,  therefore, he  was  not entitled  to the\r\n\nrelief that he sought.  We agree.\r\n\n          Dyer's sworn petition contained  nothing more than  the\r\n\nbare  statement  that  he   received  ineffective  assistance  of\r\n\ncounsel.  While  some additional  allegations were  set forth  in\r\n\nDyer's  memorandum of  law, those  allegations  did not  fill the\r\n\nvoid.   A habeas application must rest on a foundation of factual\r\n\nallegations presented  under oath, either in  a verified petition\r\n\nor supporting  affidavits.   See, e.g.,  Rule 2,  Rules Governing\r                                                \r\n\nSection 2255 Proceedings,  28 U.S.C.   2255.  Facts alluded to in\r\n\nan  unsworn memorandum will not  suffice.  See  Barrett v. United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates,  965 F.2d  1184, 1195  (1st Cir.  1992); Dalli  v. United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates, 491 F.2d 758, 760 (2d Cir. 1974).\r                \r\n\n          Even  were   we   prepared  to   overlook  this   fatal\r\n\nshortcoming, the petitioner  would not find surcease.   We review\r\n\n                                37\r\r\n\nclaims  of  constitutionally deficient  performance  on counsel's\r\n\npart under  the familiar  test of  Strickland v.  Washington, 466\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  668 (1984).  According to this regime, a criminal defendant\r\n\nwho alleges  ineffective  assistance must  demonstrate  that  his\r\n\nattorney's performance  was unreasonably deficient,  and that  he\r\n\nwas prejudiced  as a result of it.  See Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n1, 8 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 940 (1995).  When,\r                                            \r\n\nas in  this case, a defendant has pleaded guilty to a charge, the\r\n\nprejudice prong of  the test requires  him to show that,  but for\r\n\nhis  counsel's  unprofessional  errors,  he probably  would  have\r\n\ninsisted on his right to  trial.  See Hill v. Lockhart,  474 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n52, 59 (1985).\r\n\n          In  light  of  these  authorities, we  think  that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court appropriately  dismissed Dyer's  habeas petition.\r\n\nIn  his brief, Dyer contends, inter alia, that his trial attorney\r                                                  \r\n\nassured  him that  his sentence  would be  no more  than eighteen\r\n\nmonths,  and that  there  was simply  \"no way\"  that he  would be\r\n\nsentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G.  4B1.1.  Even\r\n\na generous reading of this claim leaves no doubt that Dyer failed\r\n\nadequately  to allege  any cognizable  prejudice.   An attorney's\r\n\ninaccurate prediction of his client's probable sentence, standing\r\n\nalone, will not  satisfy the prejudice  prong of the  ineffective\r\n\nassistance test.   See Knight v. United States,  37 F.3d 769, 774\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).   Similarly, Dyer's self-serving statement that,\r\n\nbut for his counsel's inadequate advice he would have pleaded not\r\n\nguilty, unaccompanied  by  either a  claim  of innocence  or  the\r\n\n                                38\r\r\n\narticulation of  any plausible defense that he  could have raised\r\n\nhad  he opted  for a  trial, is  insufficient to  demonstrate the\r\n\nrequired  prejudice.  See United  States v. Horne,  987 F.2d 833,\r                                                           \r\n\n835  (D.C. Cir.),  cert. denied,  114 S.  Ct. 153  (1993); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Arvanitis, 902 F.2d 489, 494 (7th Cir. 1990).\r                             \r\n\n          To  add the  finishing touch,  the plea  agreement that\r\n\nDyer  signed stated  in so  many words  that  he faced  a maximum\r\n\npossible sentence  of thirty  years' imprisonment.   The district\r\n\ncourt  reinforced  this warning  during  the  plea colloquy,  and\r\n\nexplained  to Dyer that his sentence could not be calculated with\r\n\ncertitude until  the  probation office  prepared the  presentence\r\n\ninvestigation report.  In response to questioning from the bench,\r\n\nDyer acknowledged his  understanding that even  if he received  a\r\n\nharsher-than-expected  sentence,  he  would remain  bound  by his\r\n\nplea.  And Dyer  also assured the court that no one  had made any\r\n\npromises to him  anent the  prospective length  of his  sentence.\r\n\nThus,  regardless of  his  counsel's performance,  Dyer was  well\r\n\naware of the full extent of his possible sentence when he decided\r\n\nto forgo a trial and enter a guilty plea.\r\n\n          Under the applicable constitutional standard, a failure\r\n\nof  proof on  either  prong of  the  Strickland test  defeats  an\r                                                         \r\n\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  See  Scarpa, 38 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n8-9.   Since  we  find  no  cognizable  prejudice,  we  need  not\r\n\ndetermine what Dyer's trial  attorney did or did not tell him, or\r\n\nwhether  the  attorney  lacked  familiarity  with the  sentencing\r\n\nguidelines to  such  an  extent  as  to  render  his  performance\r\n\n                                39\r\r\n\nconstitutionally infirm.\r\n\n          We  have also  considered Dyer's  other assignments  of\r\n\nerror.  His plaint that the district court acted precipitously in\r\n\ndismissing  the  petition without  first  pausing  to convene  an\r\n\nevidentiary  hearing is meritless.  See, e.g., McGill, 11 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n226; United States v. Butt, 731  F.2d 75, 80 n.5 (1st Cir. 1984).\r                                    \r\n\nHis remaining claims  are unworthy of  detailed discussion.   The\r\n\nlower  court  did  not  blunder in  summarily  dismissing  Dyer's\r\n\napplication for federal habeas relief.\r\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r          VI.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need go  no  further.   For  the reasons  discussed\r\n\nherein,  we affirm the judgments  in the LaBonte  and Piper cases\r\n\n(Nos. 95-1538  and 95-1226,  respectively);  remand for  possible\r\n\nresentencing in the Hunnewell case (No. 95-1101);  and affirm the\r\n\njudgment in the Dyer case (No. 95-1264) in part, but vacate it in\r\n\npart and remand for  possible resentencing.  We intimate  no view\r\n\nas to  how  the  district  court  should  resolve  the  remaining\r\n\nresentencing questions.\r\n\nSo Ordered.\r          So Ordered.\r                    \r\n\n                     Separate Opinion Follows  \r\n\n                                40\r\r\n\n            STAHL,  Circuit  Judge,  (concurring  in  part  and\r                      STAHL,  Circuit  Judge,  (concurring  in  part  and\r                                            \r\n\n  dissenting in part).   With all due respect, I  disagree with\r            dissenting in part).\r\n\n  my colleagues that the phrase \"maximum term authorized\" in 28\r\n\n  U.S.C.      994(h)   supports   more   than   one   plausible\r\n\n  interpretation.  In endeavoring  to set forth an analytically\r\n\n  sound basis for their  decision, my colleagues find ambiguity\r\n\n  where none  exists.   After careful  review, I believe  that,\r\n\n  when  applied  to  defendants  subject  to  special  enhanced\r\n\n  penalty provisions, the only plausible interpretation  of the\r\n\n  phrase  \"maximum term  authorized\"  is the  enhanced  maximum\r\n\n  punishment.   Furthermore,  once  the  phrase  \"maximum  term\r\n\n  authorized\" is correctly read as referring in these instances\r\n\n  to  the enhanced statutory maximum, I think it clear that the\r\n\n  sentencing  scheme  propounded  by  Amendment  506  does  not\r\n\n  satisfy Congress's clear command to sentence career offenders\r\n\n  at or near that maximum.  Accordingly, I dissent with respect\r\n\n  to parts I-IV. \r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n            In  reaching their conclusion, my colleagues engage\r\n\n  a full-blown  Chevron inquiry twice, carefully  analyzing the\r                                 \r\n\n  phrases \"maximum term authorized,\" \"categories of defendants\"\r\n\n  and   \"at  or  near.\"16    On  the  first  pass,  they  find,\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  16.  28 U.S.C.   994(h) provides:\r\n\n            The  Commission  shall  assure  that  the\r\n            guidelines  specify a sentence  to a term\r\n            of  imprisonment at  or near  the maximum\r                                                               \r\n\n                               -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\n  depending on  the meaning ascribed to  the term \"categories,\"\r\n\n  that the  phrase \"maximum term authorized\"  is susceptible to\r\n\n  two  different  plausible  interpretations.    If  the   term\r\n\n  \"categories\"   is   defined  so   that   it  recognizes   the\r\n\n  distinctions  between defendants subject  to special enhanced\r\n\n  penalties and  those who are  not, then  the phrase  \"maximum\r\n\n  term  authorized\" must  mean the  enhanced statutory  maximum\r\n\n  when  referring to  the former  and the  unenhanced statutory\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n            term   authorized   for   categories   of\r                                       \r\n            defendants  in  which  the  defendant  is\r\n            eighteen years old or older and \r\n\n            (1) has been  convicted of a  felony that\r\n            is \r\n                 (A) a crime of violence; or\r\n                 (B) an offense described  in section\r\n                 401 of the Controlled Substances Act\r\n                 (21   U.S.C.   [ ]  841),   sections\r\n                 1002(a),  1005,  and  1009   of  the\r\n                 Controlled  Substances   Import  and\r\n                 Export Act (21  U.S.C. [  ]  952(a),\r\n                 955, and 959), and the Maritime Drug\r\n                 Law Enforcement Act (46  U.S.C. App.\r\n                 [ ] 1901 et seq.) and \r\n\n            (2) has previously  been convicted of two\r\n            or more prior felonies, each of which is \r\n\n                 (A) a crime of violence; or  \r\n                 (B) an offense described  in section\r\n                 401 of the Controlled Substances Act\r\n                 (21   U.S.C.   [ ]  841),   sections\r\n                 1002(a),  1005,  and  1009   of  the\r\n                 Controlled  Substances  Import   and\r\n                 Export Act (21  U.S.C. [  ]  952(a),\r\n                 955, and 959), and the Maritime Drug\r\n                 Law Enforcement Act (46  U.S.C. App.\r\n                 [ ] 1901 et seq.)\r\n\n  (Emphasis added.)\r\n\n                               -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\n  maximum  when referring to the  latter.  They  define this as\r\n\n  the  enhanced statutory maximum  (\"ESM\") interpretation.   On\r\n\n  the  other hand,  my  colleagues contend,  that  if the  term\r\n\n  \"categories\"  is  read more  broadly  such that  it  fails to\r\n\n  recognize these distinctions, then  the phrase \"maximum  term\r\n\n  authorized\" must  mean in all cases  the unenhanced statutory\r\n\n  maximum  because  that  is   the  highest  possible  sentence\r\n\n  applicable  to all defendants  in the category.   They define\r\n\n  this   as   the    unenhanced   statutory   maximum   (\"USM\")\r\n\n  interpretation.   My colleagues then  conclude that,  because\r\n\n  both interpretations are  plausible, Congress has  not spoken\r\n\n  clearly or without ambiguity on  the issue and, therefore, we\r\n\n  should defer to the  Commission's choice between the two.   I\r\n\n  disagree with this analysis because I do not believe that the\r\n\n  USM  interpretation  is a  plausible  reading  of the  phrase\r\n\n  \"maximum term authorized.\"\r\n\n            Principally,   I   find   the  USM   interpretation\r\n\n  inherently implausible  because it effectively  nullifies the\r\n\n  criminal history enhancements  carefully enacted in  statutes\r\n\n  like  21 U.S.C.    841.   These  statutes, to  which Congress\r\n\n  expressly  referred  in the  text  of    994(h),  provide  an\r\n\n  intricate web of enhanced penalties  applicable to defendants\r\n\n  who are repeat offenders or  whose offenses resulted in death\r\n\n  or serious  bodily injury.  The  USM interpretation, however,\r\n\n  completely disregards these enhanced penalties because, under\r\n\n                               -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\n  that interpretation,  all defendants must be  sentenced at or\r\n\n  near  the  unenhanced maximum  whether  or  not the  enhanced\r\n\n  penalties  apply.    Recognizing that  Congress  specifically\r\n\n  referred to these statutes in the text of   994(h),  it seems\r\n\n  absurd to  suppose that Congress  did not intend  to preclude\r\n\n  this  result.   A plausible  reading of  a statute  would not\r\n\n  render  meaningless complete  sections of  other statutes  to\r\n\n  which it refers.17  \r\n\n            The  reasoning of the  District of Columbia Circuit\r\n\n  in United States  v. Garrett,  959 F.2d  1005, 1010-11  (D.C.\r                                        \r\n\n  Cir. 1992), firmly  supports this analysis.  In  Garrett, the\r                                                                    \r\n\n  court  rejected   the  argument  that  the  guideline  phrase\r\n\n  \"Offense Statutory Maximum\"  should be read  to refer to  the\r\n\n  unenhanced statutory maximum.  Id.   The court explained that\r                                              \r\n\n  such  an  interpretation (which  I note  necessarily requires\r\n\n  interpreting the phrase \"maximum term authorized\" in   994(h)\r\n\n  to mean  the unenhanced maximum)  would \"thwart congressional\r\n\n  intent.\"  Id.  at 1011.  The court  reasoned that to conclude\r                         \r\n\n  that  \"Congress  .  .  .  intended  to  erase  the  statutory\r\n\n  distinctions  among  offenders  based either  on  their  past\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  17.  The majority  contends that  this argument is  of little\r\n  moment  because a  Career  Offender guideline  using the  USM\r\n  interpretation  as  espoused   by  Amendment  506  does   not\r\n  technically  conflict  with 21  U.S.C.     841 or  the  other\r\n  enhanced penalty statutes.   While I agree that there  may be\r\n  no technical \"conflict,\" I hardly take that as  evidence that\r\n  Congress intended to permit  the Commission in interpreting  \r\n  994(h) to nullify many of the special enhanced penalties.\r                             \r\n\n                               -44-\r                                          44\r\r\n\n  actions or on the  circumstances of the offense, distinctions\r\n\n  carefully  set  forth  in  subsection  841(b)(1)(B) would  be\r                                                                         \r\n\n  senseless.\"  Id.

While it  is true  that\r                            \r\n\n  Garrett   involved  only   the  interpretation   of  \"Offense\r                   \r\n\n  Statutory  Maximum\"  and  did   not  directly  consider   the\r\n\n  statutory language,  I think its analysis  is informative and\r\n\n  applies  with equal force to  the question at  hand.  Indeed,\r\n\n  prior to  the promulgation  of Amendment 506,  the Commission\r\n\n  defined  the guideline phrase  \"Offense Statutory Maximum\" as\r\n\n  equivalent to the statutory phrase \"maximum term authorized.\"\r\n\n  See U.S.S.G.   4B1.1, comment. (n.2) (Nov. 1993).18\r               \r\n\n            Furthermore,  I  believe  the  legislative  history\r\n\n  strongly   suggests  that  Congress  intended  \"maximum  term\r\n\n  authorized\" to  refer, in  appropriate circumstances,  to the\r\n\n  enhanced  maximum  penalty.   The Senate  Judiciary Committee\r\n\n  noted that    994(h)  was enacted  to replace the  sentencing\r\n\n  provisions  for \"dangerous special  offenders\" and \"dangerous\r\n\n  special drug offenders\" provided  respectively by 18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n  3575 (repealed 1984)  and 21  U.S.C.    849 (repealed  1984).\r\n\n  See S.

As  this definition  makes  clear,  the\r\n\n  purpose of these special offender statutes was to provide, in\r\n\n  appropriate  circumstances,  enhanced punishment  beyond that\r\n\n  otherwise  provided in  the underlying  statute.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  United  States  v. Sutton,  415 F.

This is  exactly the same  rationale underlying  the\r\n\n  enhanced penalty provisions found  in statutes like 21 U.S.C.\r\n\n    841.  Because  Congress intended   994(h) to  address these\r\n\n  \"same  considerations,\"  see S. Rep. 225 at 120, reprinted in\r                                                                         \r\n\n  1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 3303,  it seems reasonable  to conclude\r\n\n                               -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\n  that Congress intended \"maximum  term authorized\" to mean the\r\n\n  enhanced statutory maximum.19\r\n\n            In sum, because the USM interpretation would render\r\n\n  ineffective  the enhanced penalties provided in statutes like\r\n\n  21 U.S.C.   841 and  because the legislative history strongly\r\n\n  suggests  that Congress  intended  the  phrase \"maximum  term\r\n\n  authorized\" to mean the enhanced statutory maximum, I believe\r\n\n  deferring to the  Commission's interpretation  of the  phrase\r\n\n  \"maximum term authorized\" in   994(h) is inappropriate.\r\n\n            In passing, I further note that,  in large part, my\r\n\n  colleagues'  argument turns  on  their analysis  of the  term\r\n\n  \"categories\" found in   994(h).  Indeed, they can only import\r\n\n  ambiguity into  the narrow phrase \"maximum  term authorized,\"\r\n\n  by first  deeming the  expression \"categories  of defendants\"\r\n\n  fatally   imprecise.     Moreover,   they  justify   the  USM\r\n\n  interpretation  by  reasoning that  any  other interpretation\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  19.  In  concluding  that the  legislative  history fails  to\r\n  disprove the plausibility  of the unenhanced  interpretation,\r\n  the majority quotes the Judiciary Committee's opinion that   \r\n  994(h) and  994(i) would \"assure the  consistent and rational\r\n  implementation  of  the  Committee's  view  that  substantial\r\n  prison terms should  be imposed on repeat  violent and repeat\r\n  drug offenders.\"   S. Rep. No. 225 at  175, reprinted in 1984\r                                                                    \r\n  U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3358.   While this statement clearly suggests\r\n  that  the  Committee   trusted  the   Commission  more   than\r\n  individual  judges  to  see that  recidivist  defendants were\r\n  sentenced  at or near the  maximum term authorized,  it in no\r\n  way suggests  that Congress intended to  grant the Commission\r\n  the  authority  to  disregard  the   sentencing  enhancements\r\n  provided in 21 U.S.C.   841 and other similar statutes.\r\n\n                               -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\n  would  write  off  \"the word  `categories'  as  some sort  of\r\n\n  linguistic accident or awkward locution.\"\r\n\n            With all due respect, I find the phrase \"categories\r\n\n  of  defendants\"  much less  troubling.   First,  I  note that\r\n\n  \"categories\" is inherently a general, imprecise term, whereas\r\n\n  I  believe \"maximum\"  is naturally  a specific,  precise one.\r\n\n  Hence,  I find it eminently  more plausible, in this context,\r\n\n  to read the phrase \"categories of defendants\"  narrowly -- as\r\n\n  referring  to  classes  of  defendants  subject  to  specific\r\n\n  enhanced  penalties -- than it is to read the phrase \"maximum\r\n\n  term  authorized\" broadly -- as referring to, with respect to\r\n\n  certain defendants,  something less  than the maximum  (i.e.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  under the USM interpretation, some defendants who are subject\r\n\n  to  enhanced  penalties will  be  sentenced  at or  near  the\r\n\n  unenhanced maximum, which, with respect  to those defendants,\r\n\n  is not the authorized statutory maximum).\r\n\n            Second,  I  do  indeed  believe  that  the   phrase\r\n\n  \"categories of defendants\"  is perhaps better  understood, to\r\n\n  use my colleagues' phraseology,  as a \"linguistic accident or\r\n\n  an  awkward locution.\"  As  I note infra,  at 11-13, Congress\r                                                    \r\n\n  added     994(h) to  the  enabling  legislation late  in  the\r\n\n  drafting process.   The subsection derives  from a sentencing\r\n\n  provision attached to other legislation that  directed judges\r\n\n  to sentence career criminals to the maximum possible penalty.\r\n\n  In attaching it to the enabling legislation, Congress rewrote\r\n\n                               -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\n  the provision borrowing the phrase \"categories of defendants\"\r\n\n  and other language from the already-existing   994(i).20  \r\n\n            In contrast with   994(h),    994(i)'s usage of the\r\n\n  phrase  \"categories of  defendants\" is  sensible in  light of\r\n\n  that  subsection's   structure.    First,     994(i)  broadly\r\n\n  instructs the  Commission to assure that  various \"categories\r\n\n  of  defendants\"  shall receive  \"substantial\"  sentences, and\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  20.  28 U.S.C. 994(i) provides:\r\n\n                 The Commission shall assure that the\r\n            guidelines  specify  a   sentence  to   a\r\n            substantial  term   of  imprisonment  for\r                                       \r\n            categories  of  defendants  in which  the\r\n            defendant --\r\n\n            (1) has  a history  of two or  more prior\r\n            Federal,    State,   or    local   felony\r\n            convictions  for  offenses  committed  on\r\n            different occasions;\r\n            (2) committed  the offense  as part  of a\r\n            pattern  of  criminal conduct  from which\r\n            the   defendant  derived   a  substantial\r\n            portion of the defendant's income;\r\n            (3) committed the offense  in furtherance\r\n            of  a  conspiracy  with  three   or  more\r\n            persons   engaging   in   a  pattern   of\r\n            racketeering   activity   in  which   the\r\n            defendant participated in a managerial or\r\n            supervisory capacity;\r\n            (4)  committed a  crime of  violence that\r\n            constitutes  a  felony  while on  release\r\n            pending  trial, sentence or appeal from a\r\n            Federal, State, or local felony for which\r\n            he was ultimately convicted; or \r\n            (5)  committed a felony that is set forth\r\n            in   section   401   or   1010   of   the\r\n            Comprehensive  Drug Abuse  Prevention and\r\n            Control  Act of 1970  (21 U.S.C. [  ] 841\r\n            and 960), and  that involved  trafficking\r\n            in a substantial quantity of a controlled\r\n            substance.\r\n\n                               -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n\n  then  it  proceeds to  list  five  different \"categories\"  of\r\n\n  defendants  to which the instruction applies.  In contrast,  \r\n\n  994(h)'s usage  of the term  \"categories\" is peculiar.   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  supra, note 16.  First,   994(h)'s sentencing command  (i.e.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  \"at or  near the  maximum term  authorized\") is  more precise\r\n\n  than    994(i)'s  broad command  (i.e., \"substantial\"),  and,\r                                                  \r\n\n  second, its structure is different:  it does not sequentially\r\n\n  enumerate  separate  categories of  defendants  to  which the\r\n\n  command applies.  Hence,  I believe the parallel language  in\r\n\n  the  two  subsections  is  best  understood  as   principally\r\n\n  revealing Congress's intent  that the two  subsections should\r\n\n  be  read together.   In  other words,  by using  the parallel\r\n\n  language,  Congress awkwardly  expressed  its  intent that   \r\n\n  994(h)  should  be read  as carving  out  a narrow  subset of\r\n\n  criminals, otherwise  subject to  the broader    994(i), that\r\n\n  should  be sentenced, not just  substantially, but at or near\r\n\n  the maximum penalty possible.\r\n\n            In  any event,  because I  believe that  the phrase\r\n\n  \"maximum term  authorized\" cannot plausibly be interpreted to\r\n\n  mean  the   unenhanced  maximum,  I  likewise   believe  that\r\n\n  \"categories of defendants\" must be read narrowly.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n            Deciding that the phrase \"maximum  term authorized\"\r\n\n  means,  in   the  appropriate  circumstances,   the  enhanced\r\n\n  statutory maximum does  not end  the analysis.   It is  still\r\n\n                               -50-\r                                          50\r\r\n\n  necessary   to   consider  whether   the   sentencing  scheme\r\n\n  propounded by Amendment 506 nonetheless  satisfies Congress's\r\n\n  directive  to  sentence career  offenders  \"at  or near\"  the\r\n\n  maximum.21\r\n\n            The defendants  contend that, when read in context,\r\n\n     994(h)'s \"at or near\" directive  is unclear and ambiguous,\r\n\n  see  United States v. Fountain,  885 F. Supp.  185, 188 (N.D.\r                                          \r\n\n  Iowa 1995), and, accordingly, this court should  defer to the\r\n\n  Commission's  reasonable  interpretation.     Moreover,   the\r\n\n  defendants  argue  that      994(h)  is  only  one   of  many\r\n\n  congressional   directives  which  the   Commission  had  the\r\n\n  responsibility  and  duty  to harmonize  in  promulgating the\r\n\n  sentencing  guidelines.   Specifically,  the  defendants note\r\n\n  that one of the main purposes of the Sentencing Commission is\r\n\n  to reduce \"unwarranted disparities\" in  sentencing and, thus,\r\n\n  assure  that  individuals  who  have  committed similar  acts\r\n\n  receive similar sentences.  See 28 U.S.C. 991(b)(1)(B).  They\r                                           \r\n\n  maintain  that Amendment  506 achieves  this goal  because it\r\n\n  eliminates \"unwarranted\" disparity resulting from exercise of\r\n\n  unchecked prosecutorial discretion in deciding whether or not\r\n\n  to seek  the enhanced penalties  provided in statutes  like  \r\n\n  841.  \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  21.  I  do not restate the  facts or describe  how the Career\r\n  Offender guideline  operates.   For a thorough  discussion of\r\n  these matters see Majority Opinion at 4-11.\r                                              \r\n\n                               -51-\r                                          51\r\r\n\n            In response, the government contends that Amendment\r\n\n  506  is invalid  because it  is  inconsistent with  the plain\r\n\n  language of 28 U.S.C.    994(h).  The government  argues that\r\n\n  the sentencing  ranges  resulting  from  application  of  the\r\n\n  amendment do not satisfy   994(h)'s clear command that career\r\n\n  offenders  should be sentenced \"at or  near\" the maximum term\r\n\n  authorized.  I agree with the government.\r\n\n            First, in analyzing 28  U.S.C.   994(h), I disagree\r\n\n  with the  defendants that  its command that  career offenders\r\n\n  should receive  sentences \"at or near\"  the statutory maximum\r\n\n  is unclear and ambiguous.   Though Congress undoubtedly could\r\n\n  have  been   more  precise   in  limiting  the   Commission's\r\n\n  discretion in this  context, the  phrase \"at or  near\" has  a\r\n\n  fairly  unambiguous  and  narrow ordinary  meaning.    Common\r\n\n  definitions of  the term \"near\"  specify that  an object  (or\r\n\n  limit) is \"near\" another if it is \"not a far distan[ce] from\"\r\n\n  or \"close to\" the  other object (or limit).   Webster's Third\r                                                                         \r\n\n  New  International  Dictionary  (1986); accord  The  American\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Heritage Dictionary (2d College Ed. 1985) (defining \"near\" as\r                               \r\n\n  \"To, at, or within a  short distance or interval in space  or\r\n\n  time.\").   The Commission's attempt  to implement the  \"at or\r\n\n  near\" directive (as  ultimately expressed in Amendment  506),\r\n\n  however, does not satisfy this  standard.  For example, under\r\n\n  Amendment 506, a defendant who qualifies as a Career Offender\r\n\n  and whose punishment  has been enhanced pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\r\n\n                               -52-\r                                          52\r\r\n\n    841(b)(1)(C) to a maximum possible  penalty of thirty years\r\n\n  is  assigned a  base  sentencing range  of  only 210  to  262\r\n\n  months.   Such a range  is but 58.3  to 72.78 percent  of the\r\n\n  maximum   possible  term   of  thirty  years   (360  months).\r\n\n  Notwithstanding  a certain  amount of  ambiguity in  the term\r\n\n  \"near\"  at the  margins, I  think it  plainly obvious  that a\r\n\n  guideline interpretation that, even before any adjustment for\r\n\n  acceptance  of responsibility,  prescribes such  a sentencing\r\n\n  range does not assure  that defendants will be sentenced  \"at\r\n\n  or near\" the maximum term authorized.\r\n\n            Moreover, a  comparison of    994(h) with    994(i)\r\n\n  makes clear beyond doubt  that Congress intended the language\r\n\n  \"at or near\" to limit narrowly the Commission's discretion to\r\n\n  prescribe sentencing ranges for career offenders.  Subsection\r\n\n  994(i), which  was added to  the enabling legislation  in the\r\n\n  Senate  prior to the addition  of   994(h),22   provides that\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  22.

See S. 1437, 95th Cong., 2d Sess.  \r                                         \r\n  124  (1978) (proposed tit. 28,   994(h)); 124 Cong. Rec. 1463\r\n  (1978).   The Senate subsequently  added   994(h)  to a later\r\n  version of the legislation  in 1983.  See S. 668, 98th Cong.,\r                                                     \r\n  1st Sess.    7 (1983  (proposed tit. 28,  994(h)); 129  cong.\r\n  Rec.  22,883  (1983).    Both  provisions were  part  of  the\r\n  guidelines enabling  legislation ultimately enacted  in 1984.\r\n  Pub.  L. No.  98-473,    217, 98  Stat. 2021-22  (codified as\r\n  amended 28 U.S.C.    994(h),(i)).\r\n\n                               -53-\r                                          53\r\r\n\n  the \"Commission  shall assure  that the guidelines  specify a\r\n\n  sentence to a substantial  term of imprisonment\" for habitual\r                                           \r\n\n  offenders,  racketeers, defendants  who  commit crimes  while\r\n\n  released on bail,  and felony  drug offenders.   28 U.S.C.   \r\n\n  994(i) (emphasis  added).23   Subsection 994(i) applies  to a\r\n\n  broad class of defendants including all defendants subject to\r\n\n     994(h).  Id.    994(i)(1) (subsection applies, inter alia,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  to all defendants who  have \"a history of  two or more  prior\r\n\n  Federal, State,  or  local felony  convictions  for  offenses\r\n\n  committed on  different occasions\").   Subsection 994(h),  on\r\n\n  the  other hand, applies  to a narrower  subset of defendants\r\n\n  that Congress  felt must  be punished even  more stringently.\r\n\n  In offering the original version of   994(h), Senator Kennedy\r\n\n  argued  that   the  amendment  was  needed   because  \"Career\r\n\n  criminals  must be put on notice  that their chronic violence\r\n\n  will  be  punished  by  maximum prison  sentences  for  their\r                                                             \r\n\n  offenses, without  parole.\"24   128 Cong.

By adding    994(h), Congress  sought to\r\n\n  indicate that certain career offenders, with serious criminal\r\n\n  histories, should  receive not simply a  \"substantial term of\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  23.  See, supra, note 20.\r                           \r\n\n  24.  Section  994(h) derives  from  an  amendment  originally\r\n  offered in 1982  by Senator Kennedy to S. 2572.   See S. Rep.\r                                                                 \r\n  225 at 175, reprinted  in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3358.   The\r                                     \r\n  1982  amendment  provided in  relevant  part  that \"A  career\r\n  criminal  shall  receive  the maximum  or  approximately  the\r\n  maximum penalty  for the  current offense.\"   128 Cong.  Rec.\r\n  26,511-12 (1982).\r\n\n                               -54-\r                                          54\r\r\n\n  imprisonment\" as prescribed by 994(i), but  instead a term of\r\n\n  imprisonment  that  was at  or  near  the statutory  maximum.\r\n\n  Indeed,  if    994(h)  is only,  as  the defendants  argue, a\r\n\n  general  admonishment  --  which  the  Commission  has  broad\r\n\n  discretion to  implement --  to punish career  offenders more\r\n\n  harshly than  it otherwise would, the  subsection adds little\r\n\n  direction not already provided by   994(i).25   \r\n\n            Second,   the  basic  structure   of  the  enabling\r\n\n  legislation  undercuts  the  defendants' argument  that  this\r\n\n  court should defer to the Commission's attempt to harmonize  \r\n\n  994(h)  with  other  purportedly   conflicting  congressional\r\n\n  directives.    The  goal of  avoiding  unwarranted sentencing\r\n\n  disparities is, indeed, one  of the broad underlying purposes\r\n\n  that   motivated  Congress's   creation  of   the  Sentencing\r\n\n  Commission.   See 28 U.S.C.    991(b)(1)(B).  Though Congress\r                             \r\n\n  restated  the  goal as  one of  the  directives to  which the\r\n\n  Commission should \"pay particular attention\"  in promulgating\r\n\n  the guidelines, see 28  U.S.C.   994(f), it is  nonetheless a\r                               \r\n\n  general objective not specific  to any particular  guideline.\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  25.  The  point made here, that a comparison of   994(h) with\r\n     994(i) clearly  evinces  Congress's intent  in enacting   \r\n  994(h) to  narrow the  Commission's discretion  in sentencing\r\n  career criminals, provides further support for my analysis in\r\n  part I.  In other words, it strikes me as quite odd to  note,\r\n  on  the   one  hand,  that  Congress   clearly  directed  the\r\n  Commission  to  sentence  career  criminals at  or  near  the\r\n  maximum,  while  noting,  on  the  other,  that  it gave  the\r\n  Commission complete  discretion to define  what that  maximum\r\n  is.\r\n\n                               -55-\r                                          55\r\r\n\n  The directive expressed by   994(h), on the other  hand, is a\r\n\n  specific  command aimed at  a narrow class  of defendants who\r\n\n  are established as career criminals.  In essence,   994(h) is\r\n\n  a specific exception, dealing with a narrow class of criminal\r\n\n  offenders, that  limits the  discretion otherwise granted  to\r\n\n  the Commission  to create sentencing guidelines.   Therefore,\r\n\n  while  the   Commission  should   strive  to   harmonize  the\r\n\n  implementation  of      994(h)  with  other,  more   general,\r\n\n  congressional directives, to the  extent that   994(h) is  in\r\n\n  tension with them, I believe that the more general directives\r\n\n  must bend to  accommodate the more specific    994(h), rather\r\n\n  than the other way around.\r\n\n            Third, I find the  defendants' and the Commission's\r\n\n  disparity arguments to be largely irrelevant in this context.\r\n\n  One of  the principal justifications cited  by the Commission\r\n\n  in  promulgating  Amendment 506  was  the  perceived need  to\r\n\n  eliminate  the  disparity  resulting  from  the  exercise  of\r\n\n  prosecutorial discretion  in deciding whether or  not to seek\r\n\n  maximum penalty enhancements.  See U.S.S.G. App. C, Amendment\r                                              \r\n\n  506, at 409  (November 1994).   A review  of the  legislative\r\n\n  history,  however,  strongly  suggests  that  the  sentencing\r\n\n  disparity that Congress hoped to eliminate did not stem  from\r\n\n  prosecutorial  discretion,  but,  instead,  from   two  other\r\n\n  sources:   (1) unchecked judicial  discretion in  formulating\r\n\n  sentences, and  (2) the  imposition  of indefinite  sentences\r\n\n                               -56-\r                                          56\r\r\n\n  subject  to parole  board  review.   See S.  Rep. 225  at 38,\r                                                    \r\n\n  reprinted   in   1984   U.S.C.C.A.N.   3182,   3221.     More\r                          \r\n\n  specifically, it  is apparent that  Congress was particularly\r\n\n  concerned  by  the  fact  that  different  judges  --  due to\r\n\n  differing views  on the purposes  and goals of  punishment --\r\n\n  tended  to  mete  out substantially  different  sentences  to\r\n\n  similarly situated individuals convicted  of the same crimes.\r\n\n  S. Rep. 225 at 41-46, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3224-\r                                              \r\n\n  29.26   It  is  not  apparent,  however,  that  Congress  was\r\n\n  overly   (or  even  marginally)  concerned  with  disparities\r\n\n  resulting   from   prosecutorial  discretion   over  charging\r\n\n  decisions.  Indeed, one of the principal criticisms expressed\r\n\n  against adopting the enabling legislation was that sentencing\r\n\n  guidelines  would simply  shift the  unchecked discretion  in\r\n\n  sentencing  from judges to prosecutors.   See S.  Rep. 225 at\r                                                         \r\n\n  63,  reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 3246.  Congress could\r                             \r\n\n  hardly  have been  seeking  to reduce  sentencing disparities\r\n\n  arising  from exercise  of prosecutorial discretion  when the\r\n\n  legislation under consideration  would, if anything,  enhance\r\n\n  that  discretion.   Hence, the  unwarranted disparities  that\r\n\n  Congress  intended  the  Commission  to  correct  were  those\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  26.  Senator Kennedy  argued that sentencing  guidelines were\r\n  necessary   because  \"[f]ederal  criminal   sentencing  is  a\r\n  national  disgrace.   Under  current  sentencing  procedures,\r\n  judges  mete out an unjustifiably wide  range of sentences to\r\n  offenders  convicted of similar crimes.\"  129 Cong. Rec. 1644\r\n  (1984).\r\n\n                               -57-\r                                          57\r\r\n\n  primarily   arising   from   judicial,   not   prosecutorial,\r\n\n  discretion.\r\n\n            Finally,  as I  have  noted,    994(h) specifically\r\n\n  refers  to the  enhanced penalty statutes  (e.g. 21  U.S.C.  \r\n\n  841) to which it applies.  These statutes, in turn, expressly\r\n\n  vest discretion in the prosecutor to seek application  of the\r\n\n  criminal history enhancements.   See 21 U.S.C.   851.   Thus,\r                                                \r\n\n  it is  reasonable to  conclude that Congress  understood that\r\n\n  its  command   to  sentence  at  or  near  the  maximum  term\r\n\n  authorized could result in disparate sentences for  similarly\r\n\n  situated  individuals  depending   on  whether  or   not  the\r\n\n  prosecutor had chosen to seek the enhanced penalties provided\r\n\n  by the underlying  statutes.  Thus,  I think the  disparities\r\n\n  that  result  from  an  implementation of     994(h)'s  clear\r\n\n  directive  to sentence \"at or  near\" the maximum  are not the\r\n\n  \"unwarranted   disparities\"   that   Congress   charged   the\r                        \r\n\n  Commission to avoid. \r\n\n            While I am sympathetic to the concerns noted by the\r\n\n  Commission in  promulgating Amendment 506, I nonetheless find\r\n\n  it contrary to Congress's  clear command.  In sum,  I believe\r\n\n  the  amendment   is  inconsistent  with   Congress's  clearly\r\n\n  expressed   intent   to  limit   narrowly   the  Commission's\r\n\n  discretion   to  establish   sentencing  ranges   for  career\r\n\n  offenders.   Accordingly, I dissent with  respect to parts I-\r\n\n  IV.\r\n\n                               -58-\r                                          58\r\r\n",

II,    212(a), 98 Stat. 1837 (1984) (codified  as\r\n\namended   at  scattered  sections  of  18  &amp;  28  U.S.C.).    The\r\n\nlegislation took effect on November 1, 1987,  and caused dramatic\r\n\nchanges both in the methodology of criminal sentencing and in the\r\n\noutcomes  produced.    These   changes  did  not  go  unremarked:\r\n\nsentencing appeals,  once rare in federal  criminal cases, became\r\n\ncommonplace.   Predictably, the  tidal wave  of appeals  loosed a\r\n\nflood  of judicial  opinions distilling  the meaning,  scope, and\r\n\napplication of  a seemingly  boundless sea of  guidelines, policy\r\n\nstatements, notes, and commentary.  And whenever it appeared that\r\n\nthe flood waters might recede, the Sentencing Commission launched\r\n\na  fresh deluge of revisions  that required the  courts to paddle\r\n\neven faster in a Sisyphean effort to stay afloat.\r\n\n          These four  consolidated appeals are emblematic  of the\r\n\ndifficulties  that courts face in dealing with the new sentencing\r\n\nregime.  All  four appeals  implicate Application Note  2 to  the\r\n\nCareer Offender  Guideline, as modified by  Amendment 506, United\r\n\nStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual   4B1.1, comment.\r                                                         \r\n\n(n.2) (Nov. 1994).  No appellate court has addressed the validity\r\n\nof  Amendment  506,   and,  in  the  quartet  of  criminal  cases\r\n\nunderlying  these  appeals,  two  able  district  judges  reached\r\n\ndiametrically opposite conclusions.   Although the call is close,\r\n\nwe  hold that Amendment 506 is a reasonable implementation of the\r\n\nstatutory  mandate, 28 U.S.C.   994(h) (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993), and\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nis therefore  valid.   Thus, after answering  other case-specific\r\n\nquestions raised by the various  parties, we affirm the judgments\r\n\nin  the LaBonte  and  Piper cases;  vacate  the judgment  in  the\r                                     \r\n\nHunnewell   case   and   remand   for   reconsideration  of   the\r                   \r\n\nappropriateness of resentencing; affirm  the judgment in the Dyer\r                                                                           \r\n\ncase in  respect to  all non-sentence-related matters  and vacate\r\n\nthe  sentence-related aspect  of  that  judgment,  remanding  for\r\n\nreconsideration.\r\n\nI.  THE AMENDMENT\r          I.  THE AMENDMENT\r\n\n          Congress created the  Sentencing Commission in 1984  to\r\n\ndesign  and  implement  federal  sentencing  guidelines.    Three\r\n\nprincipal forces  propelled the legislation:   Congress sought to\r\n\nestablish truth in sentencing by eliminating parole, to guarantee\r\n\nuniformity in sentencing for  similarly situated defendants,  and\r\n\nto ensure that the punishment fit the crime.

Faced with  a need  to\r\n\nimprovise, several  courts of  appeals concluded that  the phrase\r\n\nencompassed not  merely the  statutory maximum applicable  to the\r\n\noffense  of  conviction   simpliciter,  but  also   the  upgraded\r                                               \r\n\nstatutory maximum that results  after available enhancements  for\r\n\nprior  criminal activity  are  taken into  account.

This lexicographical choice carried\r\n\nwith it important consequences; under the courts' construction, a\r\n\ndefendant whose maximum possible term of imprisonment for a crime\r\n\nof violence or  drug offense  was enhanced from,  say, twenty  to\r\n\nthirty  years on account  of prior criminal  activity, netted two\r\n\nadditional offense levels (increasing  his TOL from thirty-two to\r\n\nthirty-four) and found himself in a steeper sentencing range.\r\n\n          In Amendment  506,  the Commission  first  meaningfully\r\n\ndefined the  phrase \"Offense  Statutory Maximum.\"   The amendment\r\n\nprovides  that the phrase, for the purpose of the Career Offender\r\n\nGuideline, \"refers to the maximum term of imprisonment authorized\r\n\nfor  the offense  of conviction  that is a  crime of  violence or\r\n\ncontrolled substance offense, not  including any increase in that\r\n\nmaximum  term  under  a  sentencing  enhancement  provision  that\r\n\napplies  because  of  the  defendant's  prior  criminal  record.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.1, comment.

The amended  note\r\n\noffers the example of a defendant who is subject to  a sentencing\r\n\nenhancement under  21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(C), in which  case \"the\r\n\n`Offense Statutory Maximum' for the purposes of this guideline is\r\n\ntwenty years  and  not thirty  years.\"   Finally, the  Commission\r\n\nopted  to give  Amendment 506  retroactive effect.

In each instance, the prosecution filed a notice\r\n\nunder 21  U.S.C.    851(a)(1)  signalling its  intention to  seek\r\n\nenhanced  penalties  for prior  convictions,  and the  sentencing\r\n\ncourt arrived  at the defendant's \"Offense  Statutory Maximum\" by\r\n\nfactoring the statutory enhancement into the mix.  The court then\r\n\nset  each defendant's  TOL and  guideline sentencing  range (GSR)\r\n\naccordingly.   Following the  promulgation of the  amendment, all\r\n\nfour defendants tried to  avail themselves of it.  We  limn their\r\n\nindividual circumstances.\r\n\n                       A.

The  first\r                                                 \r\n\napplication combines  two issues; it concerns  the explication of\r\n\nthe word \"maximum\" as  that word is  used in section 994(h)  and,\r\n\nconcomitantly,  the  meaning of  the  word  \"categories\" as  used\r\n\ntherein.   The second occasion  for Chevron analysis  involves an\r                                                     \r\n\nexegesis of the phrase \"at or near\" as used in the same sentence.\r\n\nThe  two  problems  are   interrelated,  but  they  are  somewhat\r\n\ndifferent in nature.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Although  we  are   mindful  that  plausible  if   strained\r\ninterpretations of  a series of individual  statutory terms might\r\nat times lead  to an  impermissible overall  interpretation of  a\r\nstatute, that is  not the case  here.  Whether  one conducts  the\r\nensuing analysis in one segment or two, the result is unaffected;\r\nthe  simple fact  of  the  matter  is  that  the  Commission  has\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\n                     B.  The First Conundrum.\r                               B.  The First Conundrum.\r                                                      \r\n\n          In the context of section 994(h), the term \"maximum\" is\r\n\nsusceptible  of  divergent  meanings,  depending,   in  part,  on\r\n\nprecisely  what constitutes  a \"categor[y]  of defendants.\"   One\r\n\npossible  reading  is that  \"categories\"  are  composed of  those\r\n\ndefendants  charged with  violations of similar  statutes against\r\n\nwhom prosecutors have filed notices of intention to seek sentence\r\n\nenhancements (e.g., all repeat  offender drug traffickers against\r\n\nwhom  the government  has  filed sentence-enhancing  informations\r\n\nunder  21  U.S.C.    851(a)(1)).    On  this  view, the  relevant\r\n\nstatutory maximum  for any such  defendant would be  the enhanced\r\n\nstatutory  maximum (ESM) applicable to repeat  offenders.  See 21\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.      841(b)(1),  851(a)(1).    But  this  reading  is  not\r\n\nlinguistically compelled.  The word \"categories\" plausibly can be\r\n\ndefined more  broadly to  include all  offenders  (or all  repeat\r\n\noffenders) charged with transgressing  the same criminal statute,\r\n\nregardless  of  whether the  prosecution  chooses  to invoke  the\r\n\nsentence-enhancing  mechanism  against  a   particular  defendant\r\n\n(e.g.,  all  drug  traffickers,   or  all  repeat  offender  drug\r\n\ntraffickers,  who   are  charged  with  violating   21  U.S.C.   \r\n\n841(a)(1)).    On this  view, the  word  \"maximum\" refers  to the\r\n\nunenhanced statutory  maximum (USM),  see 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1),\r                                                   \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ndeveloped a reasonable interpretation  of the vague and ambiguous\r\nlanguage of section  994(h).   That said, we  employ a  piecemeal\r\napproach here, as we believe it  better illustrates that U.S.S.G.\r\n 4B1.1,  as   interpreted  by   the  amended  commentary,   is  a\r\npermissible  construction  of  Congress's  directive  that career\r\noffenders be sentenced \"at or near the maximum term authorized.\"\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nsince this represents the highest possible sentence applicable to\r\n\nall defendants in the category.9\r\n\n          Since the sentencing guidelines must  comport with such\r\n\nspecific  statutory  directives  as  Congress  has ordained,  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v.

The  issue is not  free from  doubt.   Several courts of\r\n\nappeals have  heretofore read  the word  \"maximum\" in  the former\r\n\nfashion (as referring to the ESM), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span><pre class=\"inline\">pp. 5-6, whereas the\r                                                      \r\n\nSentencing  Commission now reads the word in the latter sense (as\r\n\nreferring to the USM).

Statutory\r\n\nconstruction  always starts     and  sometimes  ends    with  the\r\n\nstatute's  text.  Here, we find Congress's handiwork opaque.  The\r\n\nproblem is not  ambiguity in  definition.  Rather,  it is  simply\r\n\nunclear from the bare  language of the law which maxima  and what\r\n\ncategories Congress had in mind when it contrived section 994(h).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9The relevance of this  somewhat arid discussion will become\r\nmore  apparent in  Part III(C),  infra, when  the need  arises to\r                                                \r\ndetermine  the  extent to  which sentences  are  \"at or  near the\r\nmaximum.\"\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n          The earlier  cases relating  the word \"maximum\"  to the\r\n\nESM do not dictate a contrary conclusion.

Past this\r\n\npoint,  the  legislative archives  offer  no clue  as  to whether\r\n\nCongress ever  recognized either  the potential ambiguity  of the\r\n\nterm  \"maximum\"  or the  uncertainty  that  might attach  to  the\r\n\nquestion of what constitutes a category of offenders.\r\n\n          Finding the  relevant  legislative  history  to  be  no\r\n\nclearer  than  the  statute's  text,  we  look  to  the  enabling\r\n\nlegislation and  the overall  structure of the  Sentencing Reform\r\n\nAct for  what  insights they  may afford.   Superficially,  these\r\n\nconsiderations seem to support the government's position that the\r\n\n\"maximum\" is the  ESM.  Reading  \"categories\" narrowly enough  to\r\n\ndistinguish  between offenders on the basis of whether the United\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nStates  Attorney has filed sentence-enhancing informations yields\r\n\npotentially harsher  sentences in those cases,  thereby promising\r\n\nmore stringent  punishment for  selected repeat offenders.   That\r\n\nnarrow  reading also preserves  the distinction between offenders\r\n\nwho are subject to sentence enhancements based  on prior criminal\r\n\nactivity  and those  who are  not    a distinction  that Congress\r\n\narguably  delivered into the hands of prosecutors.  See, e.g., 21\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.    841(b)(1), 851(a)(1).\r\n\n          Although these asseverations  put the government's best\r\n\nfoot forward, they are at most debating points in relation to the\r\n\nproblem  at hand.  They neither indicate that Congress has spoken\r\n\ndirectly to  the precise issue  nor reflect a  sufficiently clear\r\n\ncongressional   intent   to    circumscribe   the    Commission's\r\n\ninterpretive  powers.   Indeed, the  arguments are  circular; the\r\n\ntouted  advantages  of  the  government's reading  appear  to  be\r\n\nadvantageous  only  if  one   assumes  the  conclusion  that  the\r\n\ngovernment is struggling to prove.\r\n\n          We will not add hues to  a rainbow.  Because we find no\r\n\nclear congressional  directive regarding the meaning  of the term\r\n\n\"maximum\" as that  term is  used in section  994(h), our  inquiry\r\n\nproceeds to the second half of the Chevron two-step.\r                                                    \r\n\n          2.

We believe that the Commission's act\r                    \r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nin  defining \"maximum\" to refer to the unenhanced maximum term of\r\n\nimprisonment   the USM   furnishes a reasonable interpretation of\r\n\nsection 994(h).  The statute explicitly refers to  \"categories of\r\n\ndefendants,\" namely,  repeat  violent criminals  and repeat  drug\r\n\noffenders,  and does  not suggest  that each  individual offender\r\n\nmust  receive the  highest sentence  available against him.   The\r\n\nCareer Offender  Guideline, read  through the prism  of Amendment\r\n\n506,  adopts an  entirely  plausible version  of the  categorical\r\n\napproach  that the statute suggests.   Unless one  is prepared to\r\n\nwrite off Congress's choice of the word \"categories\" as some sort\r\n\nof linguistic accident  or awkward locution    and we are not  so\r\n\ninclined   this approach is eminently supportable.\r\n\n          Our  dissenting  colleague  decries   the  Commission's\r\n\ncategorical  approach.

The most salient of these restraints is the requirement\r\n\nof  sentencing consistency.    See  28  U.S.C.     994(f).    The\r                                            \r\n\nCommission  adverted to  this concern  in promulgating  Amendment\r\n\n506, see  U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend.  506, at 409 (Nov.  1994), and\r                  \r\n\nresponded to  it by  taking a categorical  approach.   Similarly,\r\n\nCongress's efforts  to  eliminate sentencing  disparities can  be\r\n\nreconciled   with  section   994(h)'s  exhortation   for  maximal\r\n\nsentencing only if one hears  that exhortation as being addressed\r\n\nto  categories  of  defendants.    In  the  final  analysis,  the\r\n\nCommission remains fully faithful  to the welter of congressional\r\n\ncommands  by   choosing  to  treat  repeat   offenders  as  broad\r\n\ncategories  of defendants  and thereby  harmonizing the  call for\r\n\nstringent punishment of recidivists with the call for consistent,\r\n\nnon-disparate sentences.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\n          The  government lodges  two further  objections to  the\r\n\nplausibility of  the Commission's rationale.   First, it contends\r\n\nthat  Congress,  by  means  of  such  statutes  as  21  U.S.C.   \r\n\n851(a)(1),  intended  to give  prosecutors  commodious discretion\r\n\nover  the  potential  sentences  of repeat  offenders,  and  that\r\n\nAmendment 506  frustrates this intent.  Though the government may\r\n\nwell be correct  in asserting  that Congress did  not create  the\r\n\nSentencing   Commission   with   an   eye    toward   eradicating\r\n\nprosecutorial  abuses, it  does not  follow that  Congress strove\r\n\naffirmatively  to give  prosecutors  the keys  to the  kingdom.11\r\n\nWhat is  more, it makes very little sense to impute to Congress a\r\n\nyearning for  unbridled prosecutorial discretion  when two  major\r\n\ngoals of  sentencing reform  were to  \"assure that sentences  are\r\n\nfair  both to the  offender and to society,\"  S.

See S. Rep. No. 98-\r                                                           \r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">225,</span>  supra</span><pre class=\"inline\">,   1984  U.S.C.C.A.N.   at  3246.     But  Congress's\r                     \r\nexplanation  (which  stressed  that  the  Commission could  guard\r\nagainst this phenomenon because it was empowered to  issue policy\r\nstatements concerning the  review of plea bargains, see  id.), is\r                                                                      \r\nindicative of the latitude it intended to give to the Commission.\r                                                                          \r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nwhether or  not the  prosecution  has sought  to obtain  sentence\r\n\nenhancements.   This  reading, the  government says,  effectively\r\n\neliminates  prosecutorial  enhancements  and arrogates  unto  the\r\n\nCommission the  authority that Congress explicitly  vested in the\r\n\nUnited States Attorney.  We find this polemic unpersuasive.\r\n\n          We  take   21  U.S.C.     841(b)(1)  as  our  point  of\r\n\ndeparture.   This  section establishes  unenhanced  maximum terms\r\n\napplicable to all violators, enhanced maximum terms applicable to\r\n\ncertain repeat  offenders, and, in some  cases, mandatory minimum\r\n\nterms  of   incarceration  (enhanced  or  unenhanced).     It  is\r\n\nelementary that  any guideline  which prescribes a  sentence that\r\n\nfalls within these parameters does not conflict with the statute.\r\n\nWhat remains is a policy choice, and the Commission, by opting to\r\n\nemphasize the USM, has done no more than exercise its prerogative\r\n\nto make precisely this  kind of policy choice.   See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Chevron,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span>\r                                                                      \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\r\n\n          Furthermore, the choice is  not unreasonable.  The root\r\n\npurpose of the Career Offender  Guideline, U.S.S.G.  4B1.1, is to\r\n\nenhance repeat offenders' sentences.   The revamped guideline not\r\n\nonly accomplishes  that purpose but also  coheres with Congress's\r\n\ndiscernible  aims in  making enhanced  penalties  available under\r\n\nsection 841.   While that statute establishes a possible enhanced\r                                                                  \r\n\npenalty for  repeat offenders  if prosecutors choose,  the Career\r\n\nOffender Guideline, as filtered through Amendment 506, ensures an\r\n\nactual enhancement of  the TOL  for all repeat  offenders.   This\r                \r\n\ncritical  distinction belies  the  government's lament  that  the\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\namendment  sounds  a death  knell  for  enhancements required  by\r\n\nstatute.    The  guideline,   section  4B1.1,  as  explicated  by\r\n\nAmendment 506, departs from the statute, section 841, only in the\r\n\nsense that the former  seeks to enhance the sentences  of a wider\r\n\nclass  of recidivists.   This departure lacks  significance.  For\r\n\npurposes of  testing the  fidelity of the  sentencing guidelines'\r\n\ncareer  offender  provisions  to  the  statutory  scheme,  it  is\r\n\nirrelevant that some sentences  beyond those mandated by Congress\r\n\nare also enhanced.\r\n\n          When all is said and done, the Commission's decision to\r\n\ntreat  the word  \"maximum\"  as meaning  the unenhanced  statutory\r\n\nmaximum applicable  to a category of  offenders, broadly defined,\r\n\nis a plausible rendition  of section 994(h).

The Second Conundrum.\r                                                      \r\n\n          As  we  have   previously  explained,  section   994(h)\r\n\ncontains a  specific  directive  that,  in  the  case  of  career\r\n\noffenders, sentences ought  to be  \"at or near  the maximum  term\r\n\nauthorized.\"  The government contends that, regardless of how the\r\n\nword \"maximum\" is construed, Amendment  506 is invalid because it\r\n\nfails  to produce sentences that are \"at or near\" any conceivable\r\n\nmaximum.  As before,  we measure this contention by  wielding the\r\n\nChevron yardstick.\r                 \r\n\n          1.  Step One:   Congressional Intent.   At the risk  of\r                    1.

Section\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\n994(h) is  silent  as to  how  \"near\" sentences  must  be to  the\r\n\nmaximum, and  the legislative history is  singularly unhelpful on\r\n\nthis point.  Especially since  we must concentrate on the USM  in\r\n\ncalculating how \"near\" the  Commission's sentencing ranges are to\r\n\nthe  statutory  goal, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span>  supra </span><pre class=\"inline\">Part  III(B),  we are  unable to\r                                          \r\n\ndivine a sufficiently  clear expression of  congressional intent.\r\n\nThus,  we quickly move to the second    and decisive   portion of\r\n\nthe Chevron query.\r                     \r\n\n          2.    Step  Two:    Plausibility  of  the  Commission's\r                    2.    Step  Two:    Plausibility  of  the  Commission's\r                                                                           \r\n\nInterpretation.  The question  of plausibility reduces to whether\r          Interpretation.\r                        \r\n\nthe  Career  Offender  Guideline,   as  now  interpreted  by  the\r\n\nCommission,  sufficiently   ensures  sentences  that   satisfy  a\r\n\nreasonable construction of  \"at or  near the maximum.\"   In  this\r\n\nsetting, deference to the  Commission is especially  appropriate.\r\n\n\"At  or near\" is an inherently variable phrase.  In speaking with\r\n\na Texan, one  might say that Providence is \"near\"  Boston, but it\r\n\nis doubtful if that  description would (or could) be  employed in\r\n\nspeaking with  a resident of, say, Cambridge or Cranston.  In all\r\n\nevents, the phrase  \"at or  near,\" as employed  in this  statute,\r\n\nsuggests  a  continuum  of  various  sentences,  each  relatively\r\n\nfurther from, or closer to, the statutory maximum.\r\n\n          It  is  also important  to  recognize  that the  career\r\n\noffender  enhancement is not the end point of the sentencing road\r\n\nand,  by  itself,   does  not   dictate  individual   defendants'\r\n\nsentences.  Once the \"Offense Statutory Maximum\" derived from the\r\n\nCareer Offender  Guideline functions to yield  a defendant's TOL,\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nthe sentencing court  must then make  a myriad of  individualized\r\n\nadjustments to the offense level, up or down, for factors such as\r\n\nacceptance  of responsibility  see U.S.S.G.   3E1.1, role  in the\r                                            \r\n\noffense, see U.S.S.G.   3B1.1,  3B1.2, and the like.   It is only\r                      \r\n\nwhen all  the  component parts  of  the sentencing  equation  are\r\n\npulled  together that  the  court  can  ascertain  the  range  of\r\n\npermissible  sentences  and,  hence,   settle  upon  the   actual\r\n\nsentence.   Even then, the  court retains authority,  at least in\r\n\ncertain  circumstances,  to  depart   downward  if  a  particular\r\n\ndefendant furnishes substantial  assistance in the  investigation\r\n\nor prosecution  of another person  who has committed  an offense,\r\n\nsee 18 U.S.C.   3553(e); U.S.S.G.  5K1.1, or to depart in  either\r             \r\n\ndirection if aggravating or mitigating circumstances warrant, see\r                                                                           \r\n\n18  U.S.C.   3553(b); U.S.S.G.  5K2.0.  Many of these prospective\r\n\nadjustments derive from explicit  statutory commands.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n28  U.S.C.     994(n)  (directing  the  Commission  to  create  a\r\n\nmechanism through which defendants will be rewarded for rendering\r\n\nsubstantial assistance).\r\n\n          We   believe  that   this   reality   has   significant\r\n\nimplications  for the question at bar.  First and foremost, given\r\n\nthe labyrinthine way in  which repeat offenders' actual sentences\r\n\nare constructed,  heightened deference to the  Commission's slant\r\n\non  the \"at  or near\"  language  is very  desirable.

In other\r\n\nwords,  due to  the interstitial  nature of  the  career offender\r\n\ncalculation, a  reviewing court  should be generous  in assessing\r\n\nthe reasonableness  of  the  Commission's  approximation  of  how\r\n\n\"near\" is \"near.\"\r\n\n          The fact  that the career offender  adjustment does not\r\n\nitself  directly  determine  any  particular  defendant's  actual\r\n\nsentence has other  implications as well.  Unless one is ready to\r\n\nplace any and all downward adjustments beyond a repeat offender's\r\n\nreach    and even  the government does  not espouse so  extreme a\r\n\nposition   it  is surpassingly difficult  (if not impossible)  to\r\n\nexpect the Commission to  write a rule which ensures  that career\r\n\noffenders  will invariably  receive sentences  \"at or  near\" each\r\n\nindividual's ESM.  Once a sentencing court has made such downward\r\n\nadjustments, it would be surprising if many defendants' sentences\r\n\ncame very near to  the statutorily prescribed \"maximum\" penalties\r\n\nthat are theoretically available  (however the word \"maximum\" may\r\n\nbe  defined).   By  like token,  the  very real  possibility that\r\n\nupward  adjustments  to  the   TOL  may  make  career  offenders'\r\n\nsentences  more severe suggests that room should be left for play\r\n\nin  the  joints as  the Commission  implements  the \"at  or near\"\r\n\nlanguage.\r\n\n          Mindful,  as we  are, of  these complexities,  we think\r\n\nthat  Amendment 506 passes muster.  The sentences available under\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nthe  newly  explicated  Career Offender  Guideline  constitute  a\r\n\nsubstantial  proportion of  the possible  sentences permitted  by\r\n\nstatute.   We can conveniently illustrate  the point by reference\r\n\nto the  four defendants who  are involved in  these appeals.   By\r\n\noperation of  Amendment 506, defendants  like LaBonte, Hunnewell,\r\n\nand Dyer now face maximum sentences of 262 months (the top of the\r\n\nrecalculated GSR) before taking  into account any  individualized\r\n\nadjustments.  A  262-month sentence represents 109.2% of  the USM\r\n\nfor  these defendants'  offense  of conviction.12    On the  same\r\n\nbasis, a defendant like Piper now faces a maximum sentence of 365\r\n\nmonths  (76%  of the  applicable USM).    Examining the  gamut of\r\n\npossible  sentences   available  against  each   defendant  under\r\n\nAmendment 506,  the median  sentence in  the range applicable  to\r\n\nLaBonte, Hunnewell,  and Dyer  (236 months) constitutes  98.3% of\r\n\nthe  USM, while  the median  sentence in  the range  pertinent to\r\n\nPiper (294.5 months)  constitutes 61.4%  of the USM.   Under  any\r\n\nsuitable definition  of  the word  \"near,\"  we believe  that  the\r\n\nCommission  could  reasonably  conclude  that  these  percentages\r\n\nensure sentences sufficiently close to the USM   and sufficiently\r\n\nharsh   to provide  a fair approximation of Congress's  desire to\r\n\nsee that career offenders,  as a group, receive maximal  terms of\r\n\nimprisonment.\r\n\nIV.  THE APPLICATION OF AMENDMENT 506\r          IV.  THE APPLICATION OF AMENDMENT 506\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12We think that this calculation graphically illustrates the\r\nfallacy underlying our dissenting brother's lament that Amendment\r\n506,  \"effectively nullifies  the  criminal history  enhancements\r\ncarefully enacted in statutes like 21 U.S.C.   841.\"  See post at\r                                                                        \r\n42.\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n          Having  determined  that  Amendment  506  is  a  lawful\r\n\nexercise of  the Sentencing  Commission's powers, we  now address\r\n\nthe motions for resentencing.\r\n\n          The principles governing motions to resentence based on\r\n\nnewly emergent guideline amendments can be compactly  catalogued.\r\n\nWhen the Commission amends  the guidelines (or its interpretation\r\n\nof the guidelines)  in a  manner that favors  defendants, it  may\r\n\ninvite retrospective  application  of the  new  interpretation.13\r\n\nIn such an event, a defendant who believes that the amendment, if\r\n\nin  force  earlier,  would have  reduced  his  GSR  may move  for\r\n\nresentencing.  The district court, \"after considering the factors\r\n\nset  forth in  section  3553(a)  to  the  extent  that  they  are\r\n\napplicable,\"  may reduce  the sentence  \"if such  a  reduction is\r\n\nconsistent with  the applicable  policy statements issued  by the\r\n\nSentencing  Commission.\"   18  U.S.C.    3582(c)(2).14   The  law\r\n\npermits, but does not  require, the district court  to resentence\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13For  this   purpose,   an  \"amendment\"   differs  from   a\r\n\"clarification.\"  Clarifications explain  earlier editions of the\r\nsentencing  guidelines;  they  do  not  change  those provisions.\r\nBecause they are retrospective by nature, they do not require any\r\nspecial  retroactivity designation.  See  U.S.S.G.  1B1.11(b)(2);\r                                                  \r\nsee also United States v.

In contrast, amendments do  change prior guidelines and,\r\nif they are to  be given retroactive effect, the  Commission must\r\nso specify.   See 28  U.S.C.    994(u); U.S.S.G.   1B1.10.

Piper\r\n\nproffers a potpourri of protests to the court's ruling.  Only two\r\n\nof them warrant discussion.\r\n\n          First, Piper suggests that under 18 U.S.C.   3582(c)(2)\r\n\na district court may only decide whether  the policies underlying\r\n\nan  amendment  would be  served by  a  lessened sentence.   Piper\r\n\nmisreads  the  statute:   it  authorizes  the  district judge  to\r\n\nresentence  when resentencing  is  consistent  with the  policies\r\n\nunderlying  the amendment, but it neither compels the judge to do\r\n\nso nor limits his inquiry to the consistency question.  Since the\r\n\nlanguage is  precatory rather than mandatory,  the district court\r\n\nneed  not  even  consider  the policy  statements  supporting  an\r\n\namendment  if,  \"after considering  the  factors set  forth  in  \r\n\n3553(a)  to  the  extent  they  are  applicable,\"   18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n3582(c)(2), the court prefers to stand by the existing sentence.\r\n\n          Piper's  next remonstrance  suggests that  the district\r\n\ncourt  failed  to  reweigh  the  factors  delineated  in  section\r\n\n3553(a),  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">see</span> supra </span><pre class=\"inline\"> note 14,  and that,  therefore, the  court's\r                             \r\n\ndecision  cannot   constitute  a  proper   exercise  of  judicial\r\n\ndiscretion.   The  problem  with this  remonstrance  lies in  its\r\n\npremise.   The district judge presided over Piper's case from the\r\n\noutset.  He possessed great familiarity with the odious nature of\r\n\nthe offense of conviction (leading  a \"commando-style\" raid on  a\r\n\nfamily's home while heavily  armed, and searching for a  stash of\r\n\nillegal drugs supposedly secreted there).  Having sentenced Piper\r\n\noriginally,  he knew  the  intimate details  of Piper's  criminal\r\n\n                                33\r\r\n\nhistory.  At  the hearing on the motion  to resentence, the judge\r\n\nlistened to arguments  that zeroed  in on the  very factors  that\r\n\nPiper now claims were overlooked.\r\n\n          In the end, Piper's argument invites us to elevate form\r\n\nover substance.   We decline the invitation.  Where,  as here, it\r\n\nis  clear that  the sentencing  judge has considered  the section\r\n\n3553(a) factors, we will not interpose a further requirement that\r\n\nhe make  explicit findings as to  each and all of  those factors.\r\n\nSee United States  v.

Even\r\n\na generous reading of this claim leaves no doubt that Dyer failed\r\n\nadequately  to allege  any cognizable  prejudice.   An attorney's\r\n\ninaccurate prediction of his client's probable sentence, standing\r\n\nalone, will not  satisfy the prejudice  prong of the  ineffective\r\n\nassistance test.   See Knight v.

For  the reasons  discussed\r\n\nherein,  we affirm the judgments  in the LaBonte  and Piper cases\r\n\n(Nos. 95-1538  and 95-1226,  respectively);  remand for  possible\r\n\nresentencing in the Hunnewell case (No. 95-1101);  and affirm the\r\n\njudgment in the Dyer case (No. 95-1264) in part, but vacate it in\r\n\npart and remand for  possible resentencing.  We intimate  no view\r\n\nas to  how  the  district  court  should  resolve  the  remaining\r\n\nresentencing questions.\r\n\nSo Ordered.\r          So Ordered.\r                    \r\n\n                     Separate Opinion Follows  \r\n\n                                40\r\r\n\n            STAHL,  Circuit  Judge,  (concurring  in  part  and\r                      STAHL,  Circuit  Judge,  (concurring  in  part  and\r                                            \r\n\n  dissenting in part).   With all due respect, I  disagree with\r            dissenting in part).\r\n\n  my colleagues that the phrase \"maximum term authorized\" in 28\r\n\n  U.S.C.      994(h)   supports   more   than   one   plausible\r\n\n  interpretation.  In endeavoring  to set forth an analytically\r\n\n  sound basis for their  decision, my colleagues find ambiguity\r\n\n  where none  exists.   After careful  review, I believe  that,\r\n\n  when  applied  to  defendants  subject  to  special  enhanced\r\n\n  penalty provisions, the only plausible interpretation  of the\r\n\n  phrase  \"maximum term  authorized\"  is the  enhanced  maximum\r\n\n  punishment.   Furthermore,  once  the  phrase  \"maximum  term\r\n\n  authorized\" is correctly read as referring in these instances\r\n\n  to  the enhanced statutory maximum, I think it clear that the\r\n\n  sentencing  scheme  propounded  by  Amendment  506  does  not\r\n\n  satisfy Congress's clear command to sentence career offenders\r\n\n  at or near that maximum.  Accordingly, I dissent with respect\r\n\n  to parts I-IV. \r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n            In  reaching their conclusion, my colleagues engage\r\n\n  a full-blown  Chevron inquiry twice, carefully  analyzing the\r                                 \r\n\n  phrases \"maximum term authorized,\" \"categories of defendants\"\r\n\n  and   \"at  or  near.\"16    On  the  first  pass,  they  find,\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  16.  28 U.S.C.   994(h) provides:\r\n\n            The  Commission  shall  assure  that  the\r\n            guidelines  specify a sentence  to a term\r\n            of  imprisonment at  or near  the maximum\r                                                               \r\n\n                               -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\n  depending on  the meaning ascribed to  the term \"categories,\"\r\n\n  that the  phrase \"maximum term authorized\"  is susceptible to\r\n\n  two  different  plausible  interpretations.    If  the   term\r\n\n  \"categories\"   is   defined  so   that   it  recognizes   the\r\n\n  distinctions  between defendants subject  to special enhanced\r\n\n  penalties and  those who are  not, then  the phrase  \"maximum\r\n\n  term  authorized\" must  mean the  enhanced statutory  maximum\r\n\n  when  referring to  the former  and the  unenhanced statutory\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n            term   authorized   for   categories   of\r                                       \r\n            defendants  in  which  the  defendant  is\r\n            eighteen years old or older and \r\n\n            (1) has been  convicted of a  felony that\r\n            is \r\n                 (A) a crime of violence; or\r\n                 (B) an offense described  in section\r\n                 401 of the Controlled Substances Act\r\n                 (21   U.S.C.

They  define this as\r\n\n  the  enhanced statutory maximum  (\"ESM\") interpretation.   On\r\n\n  the  other hand,  my  colleagues contend,  that  if the  term\r\n\n  \"categories\"  is  read more  broadly  such that  it  fails to\r\n\n  recognize these distinctions, then  the phrase \"maximum  term\r\n\n  authorized\" must  mean in all cases  the unenhanced statutory\r\n\n  maximum  because  that  is   the  highest  possible  sentence\r\n\n  applicable  to all defendants  in the category.   They define\r\n\n  this   as   the    unenhanced   statutory   maximum   (\"USM\")\r\n\n  interpretation.   My colleagues then  conclude that,  because\r\n\n  both interpretations are  plausible, Congress has  not spoken\r\n\n  clearly or without ambiguity on  the issue and, therefore, we\r\n\n  should defer to the  Commission's choice between the two.   I\r\n\n  disagree with this analysis because I do not believe that the\r\n\n  USM  interpretation  is a  plausible  reading  of the  phrase\r\n\n  \"maximum term authorized.\"\r\n\n            Principally,   I   find   the  USM   interpretation\r\n\n  inherently implausible  because it effectively  nullifies the\r\n\n  criminal history enhancements  carefully enacted in  statutes\r\n\n  like  21 U.S.C.    841.   These  statutes, to  which Congress\r\n\n  expressly  referred  in the  text  of    994(h),  provide  an\r\n\n  intricate web of enhanced penalties  applicable to defendants\r\n\n  who are repeat offenders or  whose offenses resulted in death\r\n\n  or serious  bodily injury.  The  USM interpretation, however,\r\n\n  completely disregards these enhanced penalties because, under\r\n\n                               -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\n  that interpretation,  all defendants must be  sentenced at or\r\n\n  near  the  unenhanced maximum  whether  or  not the  enhanced\r\n\n  penalties  apply.    Recognizing that  Congress  specifically\r\n\n  referred to these statutes in the text of   994(h),  it seems\r\n\n  absurd to  suppose that Congress  did not intend  to preclude\r\n\n  this  result.   A plausible  reading of  a statute  would not\r\n\n  render  meaningless complete  sections of  other statutes  to\r\n\n  which it refers.17  \r\n\n            The  reasoning of the  District of Columbia Circuit\r\n\n  in United States  v.

In  concluding  that the  legislative  history fails  to\r\n  disprove the plausibility  of the unenhanced  interpretation,\r\n  the majority quotes the Judiciary Committee's opinion that   \r\n  994(h) and  994(i) would \"assure the  consistent and rational\r\n  implementation  of  the  Committee's  view  that  substantial\r\n  prison terms should  be imposed on repeat  violent and repeat\r\n  drug offenders.\"   S. Rep. No. 225 at  175, reprinted in 1984\r                                                                    \r\n  U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3358.   While this statement clearly suggests\r\n  that  the  Committee   trusted  the   Commission  more   than\r\n  individual  judges  to  see that  recidivist  defendants were\r\n  sentenced  at or near the  maximum term authorized,  it in no\r\n  way suggests  that Congress intended to  grant the Commission\r\n  the  authority  to  disregard  the   sentencing  enhancements\r\n  provided in 21 U.S.C.   841 and other similar statutes.\r\n\n                               -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\n  would  write  off  \"the word  `categories'  as  some sort  of\r\n\n  linguistic accident or awkward locution.\"\r\n\n            With all due respect, I find the phrase \"categories\r\n\n  of  defendants\"  much less  troubling.   First,  I  note that\r\n\n  \"categories\" is inherently a general, imprecise term, whereas\r\n\n  I  believe \"maximum\"  is naturally  a specific,  precise one.\r\n\n  Hence,  I find it eminently  more plausible, in this context,\r\n\n  to read the phrase \"categories of defendants\"  narrowly -- as\r\n\n  referring  to  classes  of  defendants  subject  to  specific\r\n\n  enhanced  penalties -- than it is to read the phrase \"maximum\r\n\n  term  authorized\" broadly -- as referring to, with respect to\r\n\n  certain defendants,  something less  than the maximum  (i.e.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  under the USM interpretation, some defendants who are subject\r\n\n  to  enhanced  penalties will  be  sentenced  at or  near  the\r\n\n  unenhanced maximum, which, with respect  to those defendants,\r\n\n  is not the authorized statutory maximum).\r\n\n            Second,  I  do  indeed  believe  that  the   phrase\r\n\n  \"categories of defendants\"  is perhaps better  understood, to\r\n\n  use my colleagues' phraseology,  as a \"linguistic accident or\r\n\n  an  awkward locution.\"  As  I note infra,  at 11-13, Congress\r                                                    \r\n\n  added     994(h) to  the  enabling  legislation late  in  the\r\n\n  drafting process.   The subsection derives  from a sentencing\r\n\n  provision attached to other legislation that  directed judges\r\n\n  to sentence career criminals to the maximum possible penalty.\r\n\n  In attaching it to the enabling legislation, Congress rewrote\r\n\n                               -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\n  the provision borrowing the phrase \"categories of defendants\"\r\n\n  and other language from the already-existing   994(i).20  \r\n\n            In contrast with   994(h),    994(i)'s usage of the\r\n\n  phrase  \"categories of  defendants\" is  sensible in  light of\r\n\n  that  subsection's   structure.    First,     994(i)  broadly\r\n\n  instructs the  Commission to assure that  various \"categories\r\n\n  of  defendants\"  shall receive  \"substantial\"  sentences, and\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  20.  28 U.S.C. 994(i) provides:\r\n\n                 The Commission shall assure that the\r\n            guidelines  specify  a   sentence  to   a\r\n            substantial  term   of  imprisonment  for\r                                       \r\n            categories  of  defendants  in which  the\r\n            defendant --\r\n\n            (1) has  a history  of two or  more prior\r\n            Federal,    State,   or    local   felony\r\n            convictions  for  offenses  committed  on\r\n            different occasions;\r\n            (2) committed  the offense  as part  of a\r\n            pattern  of  criminal conduct  from which\r\n            the   defendant  derived   a  substantial\r\n            portion of the defendant's income;\r\n            (3) committed the offense  in furtherance\r\n            of  a  conspiracy  with  three   or  more\r\n            persons   engaging   in   a  pattern   of\r\n            racketeering   activity   in  which   the\r\n            defendant participated in a managerial or\r\n            supervisory capacity;\r\n            (4)  committed a  crime of  violence that\r\n            constitutes  a  felony  while on  release\r\n            pending  trial, sentence or appeal from a\r\n            Federal, State, or local felony for which\r\n            he was ultimately convicted; or \r\n            (5)  committed a felony that is set forth\r\n            in   section   401   or   1010   of   the\r\n            Comprehensive  Drug Abuse  Prevention and\r\n            Control  Act of 1970  (21 U.S.C. [  ] 841\r\n            and 960), and  that involved  trafficking\r\n            in a substantial quantity of a controlled\r\n            substance.\r\n\n                               -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n\n  then  it  proceeds to  list  five  different \"categories\"  of\r\n\n  defendants  to which the instruction applies.  In contrast,  \r\n\n  994(h)'s usage  of the term  \"categories\" is peculiar.   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  supra, note 16.  First,   994(h)'s sentencing command  (i.e.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  \"at or  near the  maximum term  authorized\") is  more precise\r\n\n  than    994(i)'s  broad command  (i.e., \"substantial\"),  and,\r                                                  \r\n\n  second, its structure is different:  it does not sequentially\r\n\n  enumerate  separate  categories of  defendants  to  which the\r\n\n  command applies.  Hence,  I believe the parallel language  in\r\n\n  the  two  subsections  is  best  understood  as   principally\r\n\n  revealing Congress's intent  that the two  subsections should\r\n\n  be  read together.   In  other words,  by using  the parallel\r\n\n  language,  Congress awkwardly  expressed  its  intent that   \r\n\n  994(h)  should  be read  as carving  out  a narrow  subset of\r\n\n  criminals, otherwise  subject to  the broader    994(i), that\r\n\n  should  be sentenced, not just  substantially, but at or near\r\n\n  the maximum penalty possible.\r\n\n            In  any event,  because I  believe that  the phrase\r\n\n  \"maximum term  authorized\" cannot plausibly be interpreted to\r\n\n  mean  the   unenhanced  maximum,  I  likewise   believe  that\r\n\n  \"categories of defendants\" must be read narrowly.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n            Deciding that the phrase \"maximum  term authorized\"\r\n\n  means,  in   the  appropriate  circumstances,   the  enhanced\r\n\n  statutory maximum does  not end  the analysis.   It is  still\r\n\n                               -50-\r                                          50\r\r\n\n  necessary   to   consider  whether   the   sentencing  scheme\r\n\n  propounded by Amendment 506 nonetheless  satisfies Congress's\r\n\n  directive  to  sentence career  offenders  \"at  or near\"  the\r\n\n  maximum.21\r\n\n            The defendants  contend that, when read in context,\r\n\n     994(h)'s \"at or near\" directive  is unclear and ambiguous,\r\n\n  see  United States v.

Moreover,   the\r\n\n  defendants  argue  that      994(h)  is  only  one   of  many\r\n\n  congressional   directives  which  the   Commission  had  the\r\n\n  responsibility  and  duty  to harmonize  in  promulgating the\r\n\n  sentencing  guidelines.   Specifically,  the  defendants note\r\n\n  that one of the main purposes of the Sentencing Commission is\r\n\n  to reduce \"unwarranted disparities\" in  sentencing and, thus,\r\n\n  assure  that  individuals  who  have  committed similar  acts\r\n\n  receive similar sentences.  See 28 U.S.C. 991(b)(1)(B).  They\r                                           \r\n\n  maintain  that Amendment  506 achieves  this goal  because it\r\n\n  eliminates \"unwarranted\" disparity resulting from exercise of\r\n\n  unchecked prosecutorial discretion in deciding whether or not\r\n\n  to seek  the enhanced penalties  provided in statutes  like  \r\n\n  841.  \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  21.  I  do not restate the  facts or describe  how the Career\r\n  Offender guideline  operates.   For a thorough  discussion of\r\n  these matters see Majority Opinion at 4-11.\r                                              \r\n\n                               -51-\r                                          51\r\r\n\n            In response, the government contends that Amendment\r\n\n  506  is invalid  because it  is  inconsistent with  the plain\r\n\n  language of 28 U.S.C.    994(h).  The government  argues that\r\n\n  the sentencing  ranges  resulting  from  application  of  the\r\n\n  amendment do not satisfy   994(h)'s clear command that career\r\n\n  offenders  should be sentenced \"at or  near\" the maximum term\r\n\n  authorized.  I agree with the government.\r\n\n            First, in analyzing 28  U.S.C.   994(h), I disagree\r\n\n  with the  defendants that  its command that  career offenders\r\n\n  should receive  sentences \"at or near\"  the statutory maximum\r\n\n  is unclear and ambiguous.   Though Congress undoubtedly could\r\n\n  have  been   more  precise   in  limiting  the   Commission's\r\n\n  discretion in this  context, the  phrase \"at or  near\" has  a\r\n\n  fairly  unambiguous  and  narrow ordinary  meaning.    Common\r\n\n  definitions of  the term \"near\"  specify that  an object  (or\r\n\n  limit) is \"near\" another if it is \"not a far distan[ce] from\"\r\n\n  or \"close to\" the  other object (or limit).   Webster's Third\r                                                                         \r\n\n  New  International  Dictionary  (1986); accord  The  American\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Heritage Dictionary (2d College Ed. 1985) (defining \"near\" as\r                               \r\n\n  \"To, at, or within a  short distance or interval in space  or\r\n\n  time.\").   The Commission's attempt  to implement the  \"at or\r\n\n  near\" directive (as  ultimately expressed in Amendment  506),\r\n\n  however, does not satisfy this  standard.  For example, under\r\n\n  Amendment 506, a defendant who qualifies as a Career Offender\r\n\n  and whose punishment  has been enhanced pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\r\n\n                               -52-\r                                          52\r\r\n\n    841(b)(1)(C) to a maximum possible  penalty of thirty years\r\n\n  is  assigned a  base  sentencing range  of  only 210  to  262\r\n\n  months.   Such a range  is but 58.3  to 72.78 percent  of the\r\n\n  maximum   possible  term   of  thirty  years   (360  months).\r\n\n  Notwithstanding  a certain  amount of  ambiguity in  the term\r\n\n  \"near\"  at the  margins, I  think it  plainly obvious  that a\r\n\n  guideline interpretation that, even before any adjustment for\r\n\n  acceptance  of responsibility,  prescribes such  a sentencing\r\n\n  range does not assure  that defendants will be sentenced  \"at\r\n\n  or near\" the maximum term authorized.\r\n\n            Moreover, a  comparison of    994(h) with    994(i)\r\n\n  makes clear beyond doubt  that Congress intended the language\r\n\n  \"at or near\" to limit narrowly the Commission's discretion to\r\n\n  prescribe sentencing ranges for career offenders.  Subsection\r\n\n  994(i), which  was added to  the enabling legislation  in the\r\n\n  Senate  prior to the addition  of   994(h),22   provides that\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  22.

Rec.\r\n  26,511-12 (1982).\r\n\n                               -54-\r                                          54\r\r\n\n  imprisonment\" as prescribed by 994(i), but  instead a term of\r\n\n  imprisonment  that  was at  or  near  the statutory  maximum.\r\n\n  Indeed,  if    994(h)  is only,  as  the defendants  argue, a\r\n\n  general  admonishment  --  which  the  Commission  has  broad\r\n\n  discretion to  implement --  to punish career  offenders more\r\n\n  harshly than  it otherwise would, the  subsection adds little\r\n\n  direction not already provided by   994(i).25   \r\n\n            Second,   the  basic  structure   of  the  enabling\r\n\n  legislation  undercuts  the  defendants' argument  that  this\r\n\n  court should defer to the Commission's attempt to harmonize  \r\n\n  994(h)  with  other  purportedly   conflicting  congressional\r\n\n  directives.    The  goal of  avoiding  unwarranted sentencing\r\n\n  disparities is, indeed, one  of the broad underlying purposes\r\n\n  that   motivated  Congress's   creation  of   the  Sentencing\r\n\n  Commission.   See 28 U.S.C.    991(b)(1)(B).  Though Congress\r                             \r\n\n  restated  the  goal as  one of  the  directives to  which the\r\n\n  Commission should \"pay particular attention\"  in promulgating\r\n\n  the guidelines, see 28  U.S.C.   994(f), it is  nonetheless a\r                               \r\n\n  general objective not specific  to any particular  guideline.\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  25.  The  point made here, that a comparison of   994(h) with\r\n     994(i) clearly  evinces  Congress's intent  in enacting   \r\n  994(h) to  narrow the  Commission's discretion  in sentencing\r\n  career criminals, provides further support for my analysis in\r\n  part I.  In other words, it strikes me as quite odd to  note,\r\n  on  the   one  hand,  that  Congress   clearly  directed  the\r\n  Commission  to  sentence  career  criminals at  or  near  the\r\n  maximum,  while  noting,  on  the  other,  that  it gave  the\r\n  Commission complete  discretion to define  what that  maximum\r\n  is.\r\n\n                               -55-\r                                          55\r\r\n\n  The directive expressed by   994(h), on the other  hand, is a\r\n\n  specific  command aimed at  a narrow class  of defendants who\r\n\n  are established as career criminals.  In essence,   994(h) is\r\n\n  a specific exception, dealing with a narrow class of criminal\r\n\n  offenders, that  limits the  discretion otherwise granted  to\r\n\n  the Commission  to create sentencing guidelines.   Therefore,\r\n\n  while  the   Commission  should   strive  to   harmonize  the\r\n\n  implementation  of      994(h)  with  other,  more   general,\r\n\n  congressional directives, to the  extent that   994(h) is  in\r\n\n  tension with them, I believe that the more general directives\r\n\n  must bend to  accommodate the more specific    994(h), rather\r\n\n  than the other way around.\r\n\n            Third, I find the  defendants' and the Commission's\r\n\n  disparity arguments to be largely irrelevant in this context.\r\n\n  One of  the principal justifications cited  by the Commission\r\n\n  in  promulgating  Amendment 506  was  the  perceived need  to\r\n\n  eliminate  the  disparity  resulting  from  the  exercise  of\r\n\n  prosecutorial discretion  in deciding whether or  not to seek\r\n\n  maximum penalty enhancements.  See U.S.S.G. App. C, Amendment\r                                              \r\n\n  506, at 409  (November 1994).   A review  of the  legislative\r\n\n  history,  however,  strongly  suggests  that  the  sentencing\r\n\n  disparity that Congress hoped to eliminate did not stem  from\r\n\n  prosecutorial  discretion,  but,  instead,  from   two  other\r\n\n  sources:   (1) unchecked judicial  discretion in  formulating\r\n\n  sentences, and  (2) the  imposition  of indefinite  sentences\r\n\n                               -56-\r                                          56\r\r\n\n  subject  to parole  board  review.   See S.  Rep. 225  at 38,\r                                                    \r\n\n  reprinted   in   1984   U.S.C.C.A.N.   3182,   3221.     More\r                          \r\n\n  specifically, it  is apparent that  Congress was particularly\r\n\n  concerned  by  the  fact  that  different  judges  --  due to\r\n\n  differing views  on the purposes  and goals of  punishment --\r\n\n  tended  to  mete  out substantially  different  sentences  to\r\n\n  similarly situated individuals convicted  of the same crimes.\r\n\n  S. Rep. 225 at 41-46, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3224-\r                                              \r\n\n  29.26   It  is  not  apparent,  however,  that  Congress  was\r\n\n  overly   (or  even  marginally)  concerned  with  disparities\r\n\n  resulting   from   prosecutorial  discretion   over  charging\r\n\n  decisions.  Indeed, one of the principal criticisms expressed\r\n\n  against adopting the enabling legislation was that sentencing\r\n\n  guidelines  would simply  shift the  unchecked discretion  in\r\n\n  sentencing  from judges to prosecutors.   See S.  Rep. 225 at\r                                                         \r\n\n  63,  reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 3246.  Congress could\r                             \r\n\n  hardly  have been  seeking  to reduce  sentencing disparities\r\n\n  arising  from exercise  of prosecutorial discretion  when the\r\n\n  legislation under consideration  would, if anything,  enhance\r\n\n  that  discretion.   Hence, the  unwarranted disparities  that\r\n\n  Congress  intended  the  Commission  to  correct  were  those\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  26.  Senator Kennedy  argued that sentencing  guidelines were\r\n  necessary   because  \"[f]ederal  criminal   sentencing  is  a\r\n  national  disgrace.   Under  current  sentencing  procedures,\r\n  judges  mete out an unjustifiably wide  range of sentences to\r\n  offenders  convicted of similar crimes.\"  129 Cong. Rec. 1644\r\n  (1984).\r\n\n                               -57-\r                                          57\r\r\n\n  primarily   arising   from   judicial,   not   prosecutorial,\r\n\n  discretion.\r\n\n            Finally,  as I  have  noted,    994(h) specifically\r\n\n  refers  to the  enhanced penalty statutes  (e.g. 21  U.S.C.  \r\n\n  841) to which it applies.  These statutes, in turn, expressly\r\n\n  vest discretion in the prosecutor to seek application  of the\r\n\n  criminal history enhancements.   See 21 U.S.C.   851.   Thus,\r                                                \r\n\n  it is  reasonable to  conclude that Congress  understood that\r\n\n  its  command   to  sentence  at  or  near  the  maximum  term\r\n\n  authorized could result in disparate sentences for  similarly\r\n\n  situated  individuals  depending   on  whether  or   not  the\r\n\n  prosecutor had chosen to seek the enhanced penalties provided\r\n\n  by the underlying  statutes.  Thus,  I think the  disparities\r\n\n  that  result  from  an  implementation of     994(h)'s  clear\r\n\n  directive  to sentence \"at or  near\" the maximum  are not the\r\n\n  \"unwarranted   disparities\"   that   Congress   charged   the\r                        \r\n\n  Commission to avoid. \r\n\n            While I am sympathetic to the concerns noted by the\r\n\n  Commission in  promulgating Amendment 506, I nonetheless find\r\n\n  it contrary to Congress's  clear command.  In sum,  I believe\r\n\n  the  amendment   is  inconsistent  with   Congress's  clearly\r\n\n  expressed   intent   to  limit   narrowly   the  Commission's\r\n\n  discretion   to  establish   sentencing  ranges   for  career\r\n\n  offenders.   Accordingly, I dissent with  respect to parts I-\r\n\n  IV.\r\n\n                               -58-\r                                          58\r\r\n</pre>",
