Grumman  Systems  Support\n          STAHL,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\nCorporation (\"Grumman\") assigns error to the district court's\n\nhandling  of litigation  arising from  Grumman's acquisition,\n\nduplication,  and use  of  MV/Advanced  Diagnostic  Executive\n\nSystem  (\"ADEX\"), a sophisticated  computer program developed\n\nby Data  General Corporation  (\"DG\") to diagnose  problems in\n\nDG's MV  computers.   DG claimed  that Grumman had  infringed\n\nDG's  ADEX  copyrights  and  misappropriated   trade  secrets\n\nembodied  in ADEX.  A jury agreed, awarding DG $27,417,000 in\n\ndamages (excluding prejudgment interest and attorney's fees).\n\nGrumman   contends  that   the  district   court  prematurely\n\ndismissed  its  affirmative  defenses and  counterclaims  and\n\ncommitted several errors during and after the trial.  \n\n          While this case raises  numerous issues touching on\n\ncopyright   law,  Grumman's   most  intriguing   argument  --\n\npresented  below as both a  defense and a  counterclaim -- is\n\nthat DG illegally maintained its  monopoly in the market  for\n\nservice of  DG computers by unilaterally  refusing to license\n\nADEX to Grumman and other competitors.   The antitrust claims\n\nare  intriguing  because  they present  a  curious  conflict,\n\nnamely, whether (and  to what extent) the  antitrust laws, in\n\nthe absence of any  statutory exemption, must tolerate short-\n\nterm harm to the competitive process when such harm is caused\n\nby the  otherwise lawful  exercise of an  economically potent\n\n\"monopoly\" in a copyrighted work.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          After a careful analysis, we affirm  on all but one\n\nrelatively minor issue concerning the calculation of damages.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                         BACKGROUND1\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          DG and  Grumman are  competitors in the  market for\n\nservice  of computers  manufactured  by DG,  and the  present\n\nlitigation   stems  from   the  evolving   nature  of   their\n\ncompetitive   relationship.     DG   not  only   designs  and\n\nmanufactures computers,  but also  offers a line  of products\n\nand services for the maintenance and  repair of DG computers.\n\nAlthough  DG has  no  more  than a  5%  share  of the  highly\n\ncompetitive \"primary market\"  for mini-computers, DG occupies\n\napproximately  90% of  the  \"aftermarket\" for  service of  DG\n\ncomputers.   As  a group,  various \"third  party maintainers\"\n\n(\"TPMs\") earn roughly 7% of the service revenues;  Grumman is\n\nthe  leading  TPM  with  approximately 3%  of  the  available\n\nservice business.  The remaining equipment owners  (typically\n\nlarge  companies in  the high technology  industry) generally\n\nmaintain their own computers  and peripherals, although  they\n\noccasionallyneed outsideservice ona\"time andmaterials\" basis.\n\n                    \n\n1.  Because  the bulk  of the  fact-related issues  on appeal\nconcern  the  district  court's  analysis of  the  record  on\nsummary  judgment, we  generally  present the  evidence in  a\nlight most favorable to  Grumman.  See, e.g., Levy v. FDIC, 7\n                                                          \nF.3d  1054, 1056 (1st Cir. 1993).  Naturally, where the story\ntouches  on  matters  necessarily  decided by  the  jury,  we\npresent the evidence in a manner most favorable to DG.   See,\n                                                            \ne.g.,  Toucet v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 991 F.2d 5, 11 (1st\n                                        \nCir. 1993) (review of jury's damage award).\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nA.  Computer Service: Outputs and Inputs\n                                        \n\n          Support service for DG computers entails  a variety\n\nof  activities  and  a   corresponding  array  of  goods  and\n\nservices.   The  principal  activities  are  maintenance  and\n\nrepair of  computer equipment.  Maintenance  includes care of\n\nparts  subject to failure as well  as replacement of hardware\n\ncomponents to bring  equipment up to  date.  Repair  involves\n\nthe diagnosis  and correction  of hardware failure.   Service\n\ntechnicians  remedy  equipment  problems either  by  actually\n\nmending a malfunctioning part (e.g., reformatting a  \"broken\"\n\ndisk drive) or replacing the part.\n\n          Each  of these  support  service \"outputs\"  benefit\n\nfrom a range  of \"inputs.\"   For example, engineering  change\n\norders,  along with  certain documentation  and parts,  allow\n\nservice technicians to make technological updates to computer\n\nhardware.  In order to identify the existence and location of\n\na  malfunctioning   part,  a  service   technician  may   use\n\ndiagnostics   (now   increasingly  sophisticated   software),\n\nschematics  (maps of  the location  and function  of hardware\n\nelements), and various types  of documentation, together with\n\nthe  technician's  own   experience  acquired  by  diagnosing\n\nequipment   problems.     In   order  to   actually  mend   a\n\nmalfunctioning part, a  technician might fix the  part on the\n\nspot with  routine tools  or sophisticated software  (e.g., a\n\nsoftware diagnostic that  can reformat a disk drive), or send\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nthe part to  a repair  depot run either  by the  technician's\n\nemployer  or another service  organization.  The  repair of a\n\nmalfunctioning part often  requires very detailed information\n\nabout  the   part  (such  as  the   information  provided  by\n\nschematics and other documentation),  and may in turn require\n\nsmaller  replacement parts.   Finally,  replacement of  parts\n\nnaturally  requires the availability of  spares.  At the core\n\nof  this litigation is  a dispute  about Grumman's  access to\n\nsoftware diagnostics and other service \"tools\" produced by DG\n\nfor  use  in the  repair,  upgrading, and  maintenance  of DG\n\nequipment.\n\nB.  TPM Access to Service Inputs\n                                \n\n          DG's policies concerning TPM access to DG's service\n\ntools have  developed over  time.   As described  below, DG's\n\npolicies have evolved through three stages.\n\n          1.  Initial Suspicion\n                               \n\n          TPMs  made their debut  in the  1970s while  DG was\n\nstill  relatively new  to the computer  manufacturing market.\n\nDG  was  suspicious of  the ability  of  TPMs, often  run and\n\nstaffed  by former  DG technicians,  to service  DG computers\n\nwithout running afoul of DG's intellectual property rights or\n\nconfidentiality agreements binding on former DG employees.\n\n          In 1975,  DG  converted its  suspicions into  legal\n\nclaims, filing suit against Lloyd Root and Robert Montgomery,\n\ntwo  of its  former employees,  as well  as  Computer Systems\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nSupport  Corporation  (\"CSSC\"),   the  TPM   that  Root   and\n\nMontgomery  had founded  after leaving  DG.2   DG's principal\n\nallegations were that Root  and Montgomery had breached their\n\nemployment agreements by taking DG information with them when\n\nthey  left  DG,  and  that CSSC  personnel  had  been  making\n\nunauthorized  use  of DG  proprietary  information.   It  was\n\nunclear, however, whether the proprietary items that CSSC was\n\nusing  were  items  sold  or  licensed  to  equipment  owners\n\n(pursuant to agreements which  arguably permitted some use by\n\nTPMs),3  or  items  taken  directly  from   DG  by  Root  and\n\nMontgomery.\n\n          Lacking promising proof to  support its claims,  DG\n\nproposed a settlement whereby CSSC would agree to return  any\n\nproprietary  information that Root  and Montgomery unlawfully\n\ntook  from DG, and DG would expressly authorize CSSC (and its\n\nsuccessors)   to  use  DG   proprietary  information  in  the\n\nmaintenance and repair of DG computers.4   CSSC accepted, and\n\n                    \n\n2.  For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to all three of\nthe 1975 defendants as \"CSSC.\"\n\n3.  There is some evidence  that during the 1970s DG  sold or\nlicensed  proprietary information  to equipment  owners under\nagreements which  permitted owners to allow  third parties to\nuse that information to service the owners' computers. \n\n4.  DG and  Grumman (which acquired CSSC  in 1984) vigorously\ndispute the precise  scope of this authorization.   See infra\n                                                             \nSections II.C.1.a and III.A.3.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nthe  parties  signed a  settlement  agreement  in 1976  (\"the\n\nSettlement Agreement\").5\n\n          2.  Peaceful Coexistence\n                                  \n\n          From  1976 until  some point  in the  mid-1980s, DG\n\naffirmatively encouraged the growth  of TPMs with  relatively\n\nliberal policies concerning TPM access to service tools.   DG\n\nsold or  licensed diagnostics  directly to TPMs,  and allowed\n\nTPMs to  use  diagnostics sold  or licensed  to DG  equipment\n\nowners. DG did  not restrict  access by TPMs  to spare  parts\n\nmanufactured by DG or other manufacturers.  DG allowed (or at\n\nleast  tolerated) requests by  TPMs for DG's  repair depot to\n\nfix malfunctioning circuit boards,  the heart of a computer's\n\ncentral  processing  unit (\"CPU\").    DG sold  at  least some\n\nschematics and  other documentation  to TPMs.   DG  also sold\n\nTPMs engineering change order kits.  And finally, DG training\n\nclasses  were open to TPM  field engineers.  Grumman suggests\n\nthat  DG's liberal  policies  were beneficial  to DG  because\n\nincreased capacity (and  perhaps competition) in  the service\n\naftermarket would be a selling point for DG equipment.6\n\n          3.  Increased Restrictions\n                                    \n\n                    \n\n5.  Another provision of the Settlement  Agreement prohibited\nCSSC from  using DG proprietary information in  the design or\nmanufacture of  computer equipment.  That provision is not at\nissue in this case.\n\n6.  Grumman  acquired  CSSC  in   1984,  thereby  becoming  a\nsuccessor  in  interest  to  CSSC's  rights  under  the  1976\nSettlement Agreement.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          In the  mid-1980s, DG  altered its strategy.   With\n\nthe goal of maximizing revenues from its service business, DG\n\nbegan to  refuse to  provide many  service tools  directly to\n\nTPMs.   DG would not allow  TPMs to use the  DG repair depot,\n\nnor   would  it   permit   TPMs   to   purchase   schematics,\n\ndocumentation, \"change  order\" kits, or certain  spare parts.\n\nDG no longer  allowed TPM technicians  to attend DG  training\n\nclasses.   Finally, DG developed and  severely restricted the\n\nlicensing  of ADEX,  a  new software  diagnostic  for its  MV\n\ncomputers.   The  MV series  was at  once DG's  most advanced\n\ncomputer hardware  and an  increasingly  important source  of\n\nsales and service revenue for DG.\n\n          A number of items unavailable to TPMs directly from\n\nDG  were  either  available  to all  equipment  owners  (even\n\ncustomers  of TPMs) from DG,  or were available  to TPMs from\n\nsources other than DG.  For example, DG depot service, change\n\norder kits, and at least some documentation were available to\n\nall equipment  owners.  There  is also evidence  that Grumman\n\nhad  its own repair depot and that  Grumman could make use of\n\nrepair depots  run by other service  organizations (sometimes\n\ncalled  \"fourth  party  maintainers\").   Likewise,  there  is\n\nevidence that  TPMs could purchase at least  some spare parts\n\nfrom sources other than DG.  \n\n          The situation  was different with  respect to ADEX.\n\nDG service  technicians would use ADEX  in performing service\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nfor DG equipment owners.  DG would also license  ADEX for the\n\nexclusive use of the in-house technicians of equipment owners\n\nwho  perform most of their  own service.7   However, DG would\n\nnot  license  ADEX to  its own  service  customers or  to the\n\ncustomers  of  TPMs.   Nor was  ADEX  available to  TPMs from\n\nsources other  than  DG.    At least  two  other  diagnostics\n\ndesigned  to  service  DG's  MV  computers  may  have  become\n\navailable  as   early  as  1989,  but   no  fully  functional\n\nsubstitute was available when this case was tried in 1992.\n\n          Grumman  found  various  ways  to  skirt  DG's ADEX\n\nrestrictions.   Some  former  DG employees,  in violation  of\n\ntheir employment agreements, brought copies of ADEX when they\n\njoined Grumman.  In addition, DG field engineers often stored\n\ncopies  of ADEX at the work sites of their service customers,\n\nwho  were bound  to  preserve the  confidentiality of  any DG\n\nproprietary information  in  their possession.   Although  DG\n\nservice customers had an obligation to return  copies of ADEX\n\nto DG should they  cancel their service agreement and  switch\n\nto a TPM, few customers did so.  It is essentially undisputed\n\nthat Grumman  technicians used and duplicated  copies of ADEX\n\nleft  behind   by  DG  field   engineers.    There   is  also\n\nuncontroverted evidence that Grumman actually acquired copies\n\nof  ADEX in  this manner  in order  to maintain  libraries of\n\n                    \n\n7.  This latter group is comprised of Cooperative Maintenance\nOrganizations (\"CMOs\").\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\ndiagnostics   so  that   Grumman  technicians   could  freely\n\nduplicate  and use  any  copy  of  ADEX  to  service  any  of\n\nGrumman's customers with DG's MV computers.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nC.  The Present Litigation\n                          \n\n          In  1988,  DG filed  suit  against  Grumman in  the\n\nUnited   States   District   Court   for   the   District  of\n\nMassachusetts.8    DG  patterned  its suit  after  a  similar\n\naction it brought against Service &amp; Training, Inc. (\"STI\") in\n\nthe  United  States  District   Court  for  the  District  of\n\nMaryland.    See Service  &amp;  Training, Inc.  v.  Data General\n                                                             \n\nCorp.,  737  F.  Supp. 334  (D.  Md.  1990),  aff'd on  other\n                                                             \n\ngrounds,  963  F.2d 680  (4th Cir.  1992)  (\"STI\").   STI was\n                                                \n\nanother  TPM  in  the  DG  aftermarket  and  a  successor  to\n\nMontgomery's interest  in the 1976 Settlement  Agreement.  In\n\none count, DG  alleged that Grumman's use  and duplication of\n\nADEX infringed DG's ADEX copyrights, and requested injunctive\n\nrelief, 17 U.S.C.   502 (1988), as well as actual damages and\n\nprofits, 17 U.S.C.    504(b)  (1988).  In  another count,  DG\n\nalleged that Grumman had violated Massachusetts trade secrets\n\nlaw  by  misappropriating  copies  of ADEX  in  violation  of\n\nconfidentiality agreements binding on former DG employees and\n\nDG service customers.   On  December 29,  1988, the  district\n\ncourt issued  a  preliminary injunction  prohibiting  Grumman\n\n                    \n\n8.  Grumman subsequently filed an action in the United States\nDistrict  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  California\nalleging that DG  had violated  California's antitrust  laws.\nSee Grumman  Sys. Support  Corp. v.  Data General  Corp., 125\n                                                        \nF.R.D.  160  (N.D. Cal.  1988).   That court  later dismissed\nGrumman's  action  on  the  grounds  that  the  claim  was  a\ncompulsory counterclaim to DG's copyright infringement action\npending in the District of Massachusetts.

Pre-Trial Issues\n                              \n\n          Grumman raised a host  of affirmative defenses  and\n\ncounterclaims, all eventually rejected  by the district court\n\nin  response to  DG's motions  for partial  summary judgment.\n\nThree  of  these  issues  play a  pivotal  role  in Grumman's\n\nappeal.\n\n               a.  1976 Settlement Agreement\n                                            \n\n               Grumman  alleged  that  the   1976  Settlement\n\nAgreement authorized it (as a successor to CSSC) to \"acquire,\n\npossess, copy  and use\"  all DG diagnostics,  including ADEX.\n\nLiberally construed, Grumman's allegation of a right to \"copy\n\nand use\" ADEX fairly includes an allegation that  Grumman has\n\n                    \n\n9.  The jury subsequently found that Grumman continued to use\nADEX  in  violation  of  the  injunction.   That  finding  is\nunchallenged on appeal.\n\n10.

See Grumman V, 834 F. Supp. at 482-\n                                       \n\n83.   In  the  district court  decision  in STI,  Judge  Motz\n                                               \n\nanalyzed the language of  the Settlement Agreement, testimony\n\nfrom the  lawyers  who negotiated  it,  and evidence  of  the\n\nparties' subsequent conduct.  737 F. Supp. at 339-41.  On the\n\nbasis  of  this  evidence,  Judge  Motz  concluded  that  the\n\nSettlement  Agreement  did  not  require DG  to  license  any\n\nproprietary information to CSSC or its customers, nor did the\n\nSettlement Agreement  prevent DG  from prohibiting  CSSC from\n\ncopying and  using proprietary information in  the custody of\n\nDG service customers.  Id.11 \n                          \n\n               b.  Antitrust Defenses\n                                     \n\n          Grumman also claimed that DG could not maintain its\n\ninfringement action  because DG had used  its ADEX copyrights\n\nto violate Sections 1  and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15\n\nU.S.C.     1 and  2 (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).12  Specifically,\n\nGrumman charged that  DG misused its copyrights  by (1) tying\n\n                    \n\n11.  Although   the   reasoning  of   the   Fourth  Circuit's\naffirmance differed  from that of Judge Motz on other issues,\nthe  two courts appear to  have been in  total agreement with\nrespect to the Settlement Agreement issue.\n\n12.  Grumman  presented the  antitrust claims  as independent\ncounterclaims as well.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nthe availability of ADEX to a  consumer's agreement either to\n\npurchase DG  support services  (a \"positive tie\")  or not  to\n\npurchase support  services from TPMs (a  \"negative tie\"), and\n\n(2)   willfully  maintaining  its  monopoly  in  the  support\n\nservices  aftermarket by  imposing  the  alleged  tie-in  and\n\nrefusing to deal with TPMs.\n\n          Concerning  the tying  claim,  the  district  court\n\nagain  adopted the reasoning  of the  Fourth Circuit  in STI,\n                                                            \n\nthis  time for  the proposition  that there  was insufficient\n\nproof  of a  tying agreement  to withstand  summary judgment.\n\nGrumman V, 834  F. Supp. at 484-85.  The  Fourth Circuit held\n         \n\nthat there was  no positive tie for  two independent reasons.\n\nFirst,  the court noted that DG did not actually license ADEX\n\nto its service customers.  STI,  963 F.2d at 686-87.  Second,\n                              \n\nthe  court held that there  was not enough  evidence to prove\n\nthat  any license to use ADEX was conditioned on the purchase\n\nof DG  support services.  Id.  at 687.  The  court noted that\n                             \n\nthere  was  no  explicit   tying  condition  in  any  written\n\nagreement.   Id.    The  court  also  noted  that  there  was\n                \n\ninsufficient evidence  of unwilling  purchases of  DG support\n\nservice  so  as  to  justify  an  inference  of  an  implicit\n\ncondition; customers may  simply prefer service supported  by\n\nADEX  diagnostics over service that  is not.   Id. at 687-88.\n                                                  \n\nThe court  further held that there  was insufficient evidence\n\nof  a negative tie because,  on the record  before the court,\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n\"[t]he  fact that CMOs do not  purchase repair services . . .\n\nis at least as consistent with the legitimate and independent\n\nbusiness decision not to purchase  unneeded services as it is\n\nwith an agreement  not to  purchase such services.\"   Id.  at\n                                                         \n\n686.\n\n          Judge Skinner conducted his own exhaustive analysis\n\nof the  monopolization claim, concluding that  Grumman failed\n\nto  \"assert[]  any  facts  that would  indicate  that  DG has\n\nengaged in  any unlawful exclusionary conduct.\"   Grumman II,\n                                                            \n\n761  F. Supp.  at 192.   The  court essentially  narrowed the\n\nquestion to whether DG's restrictive policies with respect to\n\nTPMs  constitute   unlawful  unilateral  refusals   to  deal,\n\nreasoning  that  DG's actions  do not  rise  to the  level of\n\nunlawful exclusionary conduct for several reasons.  The court\n\nagreed  with Grumman that this case, like Aspen Skiing Co. v.\n                                                          \n\nAspen  Highlands Skiing  Corp., 472  U.S. 585  (1985), raises\n                              \n\n\"the issue of prior promotion of competition in a market that\n\nis  later halted,\"  Grumman II,  761  F. Supp.  at 190.   The\n                              \n\ndistrict court  nonetheless concluded that Grumman had failed\n\nto   demonstrate   that   DG's   restrictive   policies  have\n\nunreasonably harmed the competitive  process.  In particular,\n\nthe  court  noted that  DG's  policies with  respect  to most\n\nservice products  do not prevent  TPMs from competing  in the\n\nservice market  because \"DG  will sell its  service products,\n\nexcept  [ADEX  and  schematics],  to  any  ultimate  consumer\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nregardless of whether  [the consumer] now  or later use[s]  a\n\nTPM.\"  Id. at 191.   The court also observed that  \"TPMs have\n          \n\ndemonstrated  the  ability  to develop  diagnostics  [without\n\nschematics], even  if they are not as  efficient as MV/ADEX.\"\n\nId.  Lastly, the  court suggested that the Sherman  Act would\n   \n\nnot compel  DG to disclose  its schematics,  in part  because\n\nsuch compulsory disclosure would  undermine the incentives of\n\ncopyright and patent laws.  Id. at 192.13\n                               \n\n          In rejecting Grumman's  motion for  reconsideration\n\nof the grant of summary judgment on the monopolization claim,\n\nthe   district  court   also  directly   addressed  Grumman's\n\ncontention  that  DG's  refusal   to  license  ADEX  to  TPMs\n\nconstitutes exclusionary conduct.  The court stated that DG's\n\nrefusal to license ADEX to  TPMs was not exclusionary because\n\n\"DG  offers to  the public a  license to  use MV/ADEX  on any\n\ncomputer  owned by the customer,\"  and therefore DG \"`did not\n\nwithhold from one member  of the public a service  offered to\n\nthe rest[.]'\"   Grumman III,  slip op. at  5 (citing  Olympia\n                                                             \n\nEquip.

The district court also held  that neither ADEX nor DG's\nschematics   were  \"essential  facilities\"   that  DG  (as  a\nmonopolist in  the service  aftermarket) must share  with its\ncompetitors.  Id. at  191-92.  Grumman does not  assign error\n                 \nto this aspect of the district court's decision.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\n          Grumman  unsuccessfully  sought  to   convince  the\n\ndistrict court that Section 301 of the Copyright Act of 1976,\n\n17 U.S.C.    301 (1988 &amp; Supp. IV 1992),  preempts DG's state\n\nlaw  action  for  misappropriation  of trade  secrets.    The\n\ndistrict court  held that  DG's trade  secrets claim  was not\n\npreempted because DG did not simply allege conduct equivalent\n\nto  the  copying  and   use  which  form  the  basis   of  an\n\ninfringement  claim;  instead, DG's  trade secrets  claim was\n\nbased  on  Grumman's  acquisition  of ADEX  in  violation  of\n\nconfidentiality agreements binding on former DG employees and\n\nservice customers.

Trial Issues\n                          \n\n          Stripped  of  its  affirmative   defenses,  Grumman\n\nproceeded to  trial.  Grumman focused  its defensive energies\n\nin two areas.  Grumman attacked DG's proof of the prima facie\n\nelements  of copyright  infringement and  misappropriation of\n\ntrade secrets, and   attempted to undermine DG's broad-gauged\n\nrequest for compensation for lost profits and disgorgement of\n\nGrumman's MV-related profits.\n\n               a.  Validity of Copyright Registration\n                                                     \n\n          During  the trial,  it became  evident that  DG had\n\nmade  several  errors  in  registering its  ADEX  copyrights.\n\nAfter  Edward Gove,  a  DG official,  testified  that DG  had\n\ndeposited with  the Copyright Office the  correct excerpts of\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nhuman-readable \"source code,\"14  Grumman introduced  evidence\n\nthat there were  some errors  in the deposits  for the  first\n\nthree  versions  of  ADEX.     In  rebuttal  testimony,  Gove\n\nconfirmed  that there  were  a number  of minor,  inadvertent\n\nerrors in the deposits that would not affect the operation of\n\nthe programs.15\n\n          Grumman argued to the district court that any error\n\nin a copyright deposit  renders the registration invalid, and\n\nrequested  that the court so instruct the jury.  The district\n\ncourt  refused,  instructing  the  jury  instead  that minor,\n\ninadvertent  errors in  the deposit  of excerpts  of computer\n\ncode  do   not  threaten   the  validity  of   the  copyright\n\nregistration.   As  a fall-back  tactic, Grumman  renewed its\n\nprevious request that the district court compel DG to produce\n\nthe  entire human-readable  source code  for each  version of\n\nADEX so  that  Grumman could  more effectively  cross-examine\n\nGove about  the  significance of  the errors.   The  district\n\ncourt refused to do so, and later explained its discretionary\n\ndecision by finding that \"Grumman had an adequate opportunity\n\n                    \n\n14.  \"Source  code\" refers to an annotated text, written in a\nprogramming  language intelligible to humans, that represents\nthe  set of  instructions  comprising a  particular  computer\nprogram.

Supp. at 352.   Using a special verdict form, the\n  \n\njury found that DG  had properly registered each of  the ADEX\n\ncopyrights.\n\n               b.  Actual Damages and Profits\n                                             \n\n          Grumman argued that  the jury  should identify  and\n\nignore  that  portion  of  Grumman's profits  which  was  not\n\nattributable  to Grumman's use of ADEX.  To this end, Grumman\n\nintroduced evidence  that some  of its revenues  were derived\n\nfrom  servicing  DG computers  that  cannot  or need  not  be\n\nserviced  with ADEX, and that  the value of  Grumman's use of\n\nADEX to service customers with MV computers was distinct from\n\nthe value of other products and services Grumman  provided to\n\nthose customers.\n\n          In  contrast,  DG  offered  evidence  that  because\n\nequipment  owners prefer  to  purchase all  service from  one\n\nvendor, equipment owners with both MV  computers and other DG\n\ncomputers  (\"mixed-equipment  customers\")   would  not   have\n\npurchased service  from Grumman if Grumman  had lacked access\n\nto ADEX.  DG also offered evidence tending to show that, even\n\nif Grumman did not  always use ADEX in servicing  a computer,\n\nGrumman could not have  attracted and retained its MV-related\n\nbusiness had  it not been  for Grumman's  use of ADEX.   DG's\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nexpert witness opined that DG's damages totaled $28,003,000 -\n\n-  $26,364,000  in  DG's   lost  profits  and  $1,639,000  in\n\nnonduplicative  profits16 earned  by Grumman  as a  result of\n\nits acquisition and use of ADEX.\n\n          Attempting to blunt at  least part of DG's sweeping\n\n\"but  for\"  theory,  Grumman  asked  the  district  court  to\n\ninstruct  the  jury to  discount  that  portion of  Grumman's\n\nprofits which was not attributable to the  infringement.  The\n\ncourt instructed  the jury that DG could recover that portion\n\nof   Grumman's  profits   that   was  \"attributable   to  the\n\ninfringement,\"  but did not  elaborate on the  jury's task in\n\nthis regard.   Left to choose between  the parties' theories,\n\nthe  jury apparently  accepted  the essence  of DG's  theory,\n\nthough   the  total   award  of   compensatory  damages   was\n\n$27,417,000, somewhat less than DG requested.17  \n\n          3.  Post-Trial Issues\n                               \n\n          Grumman sought relief from the judgment on a number\n\nof grounds, two of which are most relevant to this appeal.\n\n               a.  Actual Damages and Profits\n                                             \n\n                    \n\n16.  \"Nonduplicative profits\"  are  those profits  earned  by\nGrumman  that  would not  have been  available  to DG  in the\nabsence  of Grumman's  wrongful  conduct.   See  17 U.S.C.   \n                                               \n504(b) (providing that copyright owner may \"recover . . . any\nprofits  of  the  infringer  that  are  attributable  to  the\ninfringement and  are not taken into account in computing the\nactual damages\").\n\n17.  On  the verdict slip, the jury  assessed the same amount\nof damages  -- $27,417,000 --  for Grumman's misappropriation\nof trade secrets.\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\n          Claiming that the jury's award  was speculative and\n\nexcessive,   Grumman  moved  for  a  new  trial  or,  in  the\n\nalternative, remittitur.  See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 59(a).  As the\n                             \n\ndistrict court related:\n\n          Grumman complains that  the jury  awarded\n          speculative and excessive damages because\n          it  uncritically adopted  the plaintiff's\n          damage analysis in its entirety which was\n          built   on   theoretically  unsound   and\n          factually  inaccurate assumptions.   More\n          specifically, defendant contends that the\n          plaintiff's  damage  analysis  failed  to\n          identify  relevant  revenues,  failed  to\n          apply  a  reasonable  profit margin,  and\n          failed   to  apportion   service  profits\n          between  infringing   and  non-infringing\n          activities.\n\nGrumman  VI, 825  F. Supp.  at 349  (footnote omitted).   The\n           \n\ndistrict court denied the motion, ruling in essence that DG's\n\ntheory of  damages was proper and  that the jury was  free to\n\nweigh the testimony of DG's experts more heavily than that of\n\nGrumman's experts.  Id. at 349-51.\n                       \n\n               b.  Attorney's Fees\n                                  \n\n          The district court  included in its  judgment order\n\nan award of attorney's fees under the Copyright Act, although\n\nit  appears  that the  court has  not  yet fixed  the amount.\n\nGrumman  argued that  the court  should not  award attorney's\n\nfees because  DG had \"elected\" only  those remedies available\n\nunder Massachusetts  trade secrets law, which  does not allow\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\nan award of  attorney's fees.18   The  district court  denied\n\nthe motion, finding that DG had merely sought to maximize the\n\njudgment  by selecting the most generous body of law for each\n\nelement of its  recovery.  Grumman  VI, 825 F. Supp.  at 346.\n                                      \n\nThe district court reasoned further that because DG would not\n\nreceive  a double award of attorney's  fees, the judgment was\n\nin no need of correction.  Id. at 346-47.\n                              \n\n          4.  Issues on Appeal\n                              \n\n          Grumman  renews its  arguments concerning  the pre-\n\ntrial, trial, and post-trial issues described above.  Grumman\n\nclaims  that the  district  court erred  in entering  summary\n\njudgment on its affirmative defenses, questions the propriety\n\nof  certain  of  the   district  court's  jury  instructions,\n\nmaintains that the jury's  award of damages lacks evidentiary\n\nsupport,  and insists  that  DG is  not  entitled to  recover\n\nattorney's fees.   After reviewing the  procedural rules that\n\ngovern this appeal, we address each of Grumman's arguments in\n\nturn.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                    PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLES\n                                         \n\n          Because this  appeal turns largely on  questions of\n\nlaw,  we  outline  the  corresponding   standard  of  review.\n\nAlthough  the reasoning  of  the court  below  may provide  a\n\n                    \n\n18.  Massachusetts  law   provides  for  a  higher   rate  of\nprejudgment  interest  on  compensatory  damages   than  does\nfederal law.\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\nuseful starting point for analysis, the district court's view\n\nof the  law  is not  binding  on a  court  of appeals.    See\n                                                             \n\nWilliams  v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing\n                   \n\nDedham Water Co.  v. Cumberland Farms  Dairy, Inc., 972  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992)).  Thus, we exercise our independent\n\njudgment in evaluating the  legal correctness of the district\n\ncourt's  jury instructions.  Likewise,  we must reach our own\n\nconclusion as to a statute's correct construction.   See FDIC\n                                                             \n\nv. Keating, 12 F.3d 314, 316 (1st Cir. 1993).\n          \n\n          Similarly, in reviewing a district court's entry of\n\nsummary judgment, we determine  anew whether the moving party\n\nhas shown \"that there is no genuine issue as  to any material\n\nfact  and that  [it] is entitled  to judgment as  a matter of\n\nlaw.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P.  56(c).  See also  Bird v. Centennial\n                                                             \n\nIns.  Co.,  11 F.3d  228,  231 (1st  Cir.  1993).   \"In  this\n         \n\ncontext, `genuine' means  that the evidence about the fact is\n\nsuch  that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor\n\nof  the nonmoving party and `material' means that the fact is\n\none  that  might affect  the outcome  of  the suit  under the\n\ngoverning law.\"  Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1993)  (citations,  internal  quotation marks,  and  brackets\n\nomitted).    Although \"we  read  the record  and  indulge all\n\ninferences  in  a  light  most favorable  to  the  non-moving\n\nparty,\"   Rivera-Ruiz v.  Gonzalez-Rivera, 983 F.2d  332, 334\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir. 1993),  the adverse  party cannot  defeat  a well-\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nsupported motion  by \"rest[ing] upon the  mere allegations or\n\ndenials of [its] pleading,\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).   If the\n\nnonmovant  bears  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  with\n\nrespect  to  its  claim  or  defense,  it  may  avert summary\n\njudgment only  if it  identifies issues genuinely  in dispute\n\nand  advances convincing  theories as  to their  materiality.\n\nSee  Pagano,  983 F.2d  at  347 (citing  Anderson  v. Liberty\n                                                             \n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986)).  Of course, it may\n           \n\nbe difficult for a trial court to forecast  the reaction of a\n\nreasonable jury  to an  intricate array of  complex theories.\n\nNonetheless,  Rule 56 applies equally to simple cases as well\n\nas cases  involving complicated legal principles and theories\n\nof recovery.  See,  e.g., Amerinet, Inc. v. Xerox  Corp., 972\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1483, 1490 (8th Cir. 1992) (\"In complex antitrust cases,\n\nno different or heightened standard for the grant  of summary\n\njudgment applies.\"), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1048 (1993).  \n                                 \n\n          Finally, we note that we are at liberty to affirm a\n\ndistrict  court's grant  of summary  judgment \"on  any ground\n\nsupported  in the record even  if the issue  was not pleaded,\n\ntried or  otherwise referred  to in the  proceedings below.'\"\n\nde Casenave v.

DG's Intellectual Property Claims\n                                     \n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\n          We first  examine the two arguments  that strike at\n\nthe heart of DG's right  to pursue its claims:   DG's alleged\n\nfailure   to   comply   with   the   copyright   registration\n\nrequirements and  the possible preemption of  the state trade\n\nsecrets claim by Section 301 of  the Copyright Act.  We  then\n\ndiscuss  Grumman's  two  affirmative  defenses  --  the  1976\n\nSettlement Agreement Defense and the \"misuse\" defense -- each\n\nof  which is intended  to undermine both  the copyright claim\n\nand the  trade secrets claim.   Finally, we  review Grumman's\n\nchallenges  to  the  award  of  actual  damages,  infringer's\n\nprofits, and attorney's fees.\n\n          1.  Validity of Copyright Registration\n                                                \n\n          Registration of  a work  with the  Copyright Office\n\nprovides several  benefits to a plaintiff  in an infringement\n\naction.  First,  although copyright  protection attaches  the\n\nday original expression is fixed in a tangible medium, see 17\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   102(a) (1988 &amp; Supp. IV 1992), and thus an infringer\n\nmay  be liable for infringement from that day forward, see 17\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.     408(a)  (1988 &amp;  Supp.  IV  1992) (providing  that\n\n\"registration is  not a condition of  copyright protection\"),\n\nregistration of the copyright is a prerequisite to suit under\n\nthe Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.   411(a) (1988 &amp; Supp. IV 1992).\n\nSecond, upon accepting the registrant's application, fee, and\n\ndeposit of a representative copy of the work, see 17 U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n408,   the   Copyright  Office   issues   a  certificate   of\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\nregistration, which is  admissible in an infringement  action\n\nas \"prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and\n\nof the facts stated  in the certificate,\" 17 U.S.C.    410(c)\n\n(1988).19    In the  case  of computer  programs  which, like\n\nADEX, are  either unpublished  or published only  in machine-\n\nreadable form, the copyright  owner must deposit \"identifying\n\nportions of  the program,\"  generally the  first and last  25\n\npages  of   the  human-readable  source  code   37  C.F.R.   \n\n202.20(c)(2)(vii) (1993).20   By questioning  DG's compliance\n\nwith  the registration  requirements, Grumman  is effectively\n\nclaiming that (1) DG may not claim infringement of those ADEX\n\ncopyrights for which DG tendered a defective deposit; and (2)\n\neven  if DG is free to bring  such claims, it is not entitled\n\nto  a presumption  as to  the validity  of the  copyrights at\n\nissue.\n\n                    \n\n19.  To demonstrate copyright infringement, DG had the burden\nof  demonstrating (1) that it  owns a valid  copyright in the\nversions  of ADEX alleged to  have been copied,  and (2) that\nGrumman copied  constituent, original elements of  ADEX.

Where the  program contains  trade secret  material, the\ncopyright regulations permit some  portions of the deposit to\nbe blocked out,  and allow a portion of the  deposit to be in\nmachine-readable \"object  code\" (lines  of zeroes and  ones).\n37 C.F.R.   202.20(c)(2)(vii)(A)(2).  If the deposit includes\nno blocked-out portions and consists entirely of source code,\nthe first and  last ten  pages of the  program will  suffice.\nId.\n   \n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\n          Essentially,   Grumman's   argument  is   that  the\n\ndistrict  court erred  in  instructing the  jury that  minor,\n\ninadvertent errors in material deposited with a  registration\n\napplication   do   not    affect   the   validity    of   the\n\nregistration.21     DG  admits  that  there were  inadvertent\n\nerrors  in  the  material  deposited  with  the  registration\n\napplication for  ADEX Revisions  0.0 to 2.0,22  but maintains\n\nthat  the errors  are  inconsequential.23   Grumman does  not\n\n                    \n\n21.  The district court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n               Because the function or registration\n          [with  respect  to computer  programs] is\n          symbolic,   clerical    errors   in   the\n          materials deposited  with the application\n          for  registration  do   not  affect   the\n          validity  of  the   registration.     For\n          instance,  discrepancies  in  the  dates,\n          filing the wrong pages, or partial pages,\n          and  similar errors,  if accepted  by the\n          Copyright  Office,  do  not  impeach  the\n          validity and effect of  the registration.\n          If the errors were  intentional, however,\n          for purposes of  deceiving the  Copyright\n          Office  and  perpetrating  a  fraud,  the\n          errors invalidate the registration.\n\n22.  Grumman does not question  the validity of the copyright\nregistration  for  the  last  five versions  of  ADEX,  which\n                            \nGrumman  also  admitted  it  copied  and  used.    Therefore,\nGrumman's  argument, if  persuasive, would  not  constitute a\ncomplete defense  to the infringement action;  the real issue\nis the extent of infringement properly subject to suit.\n\n23.  With  respect to ADEX  Revisions 0.0,  1.0, and  2.0, DG\nattempted to deposit the  first and last ten pages  of source\ncode (with  no trade secrets blocked-out)  in accordance with\n37 C.F.R.   202.20(c)(2)(vii)(A)(2).  In all three instances,\nDG deposited the correct  last ten pages but did  not deposit\nthe correct first  ten pages.   Nonetheless, in  the case  of\nADEX Revisions  1.0 and  2.0, there was  only one  difference\nbetween  the deposited  pages and  the pages  DG  intended to\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nquibble with DG's denial of intent, but argues in effect that\n\nany  error,  however  minor,  precludes a  finding  that  the\n   \n\nplaintiff  complied  with  Section  408(b).    Alternatively,\n\nGrumman argues that an unintentional error in the deposit may\n\nstill  invalidate a  copyright registration  if the  error is\n\nmaterial.   Grumman contends further that  the district court\n\nerred  in refusing  Grumman's request  for production  of the\n\nentire  source code for each  of the first  three versions of\n\nADEX, a decision which allegedly prejudiced Grumman's ability\n\nto  demonstrate  that the  defects  in the  deposit  were not\n\nminor.

Although a  different rule for  deposit errors\n\nmight be warranted if the language and underlying purposes of\n\nthe deposit  requirement were  of  a significantly  different\n\n                    \n\n24.  Some courts  have suggested  that a defendant  must show\nthat  it  was  prejudiced  by a  fraudulent  misstatement  or\n                         \nomission in  a registration  application, see,  e.g., Harris,\n                                                            \n734 F.2d at  1335 (\"Absent intent  to defraud and  prejudice,\ninaccuracies in copyright  registrations do  not bar  actions\nfor infringement.\"), whereas others merely require proof that\nan intentional error, if  discovered by the Copyright Office,\nwould have  been material to the  registration decision, see,\n                                                            \ne.g.,  Eckes, 736 F.2d at 861-62.

Likewise,\n\njust as  Section 409  sets forth  what an application  \"shall\n                                                             \n\ninclude,\"  (emphasis  added), Section  408(b)  uses  the same\n\nphrase  to prescribe the contents  of the deposit.   There is\n\nnothing in this language  that would prevent our interpreting\n\nboth   the   application   requirements   and   the   deposit\n\nrequirements in a consistent and practical manner.\n\n          Nor  do  the  apparent   purposes  of  the  deposit\n\nrequirement counsel a different  result.  Although related to\n\nthe deposit requirement in Section 407, which is  designed to\n\nfurther the  acquisitions policy of the  Library of Congress,\n\nthe deposit  required by  Section 408(b) serves  the separate\n\npurpose  of  providing the  Library's  Copyright Office  with\n\nsufficient  material  to  identify  the  work  in  which  the\n\nregistrant  claims a copyright.   See H.R.  Rep.

Pursuant to\n\nthe Copyright Act, the Register of Copyrights must register a\n\ncopyright claim and issue a registration certificate \"[w]hen,\n\nafter  examination, the Register . . .  determines that . . .\n\nthe  material  deposited  constitutes  copyrightable  subject\n\nmatter.\"   17 U.S.C.    410(a) (1988).25   Some provisions of\n\nthe   copyright  regulations   seek  to  preserve   the  same\n\nopportunity for examination  in relation to the  deposit of a\n\nrelatively small  subset of a computer program.   In adopting\n\nregulations encouraging  source  code deposits  for  computer\n\nprograms,   the  Copyright   Office   explained  that   \"[i]n\n\nregistering   all  copyright  claims,  the  Copyright  Office\n\n                    \n\n25.  Because Section  410(a) does  not specify the  nature of\nthe  \"examination,\"  and  because   there  is  evidence  that\nCongress intended the government to  play a role in copyright\nregistration  that is  much more  limited than  its extensive\nresponsibilities  in  overseeing  patent   registration,  the\nCopyright  Office  may  have  the  discretion  to  limit  its\nexamination  to the  facial validity  of the  application and\ndeposit.  See Midway Mfg. Co. v. Bandai-America, Inc., 546 F.\n                                                     \nSupp. 125,  143-44 (D.N.J. 1982) (citing,  inter alia, Donald\n                                                             \nv.

Nevertheless,  any such  discretion  resides  in the\nCopyright  Office, not  the  applicant,  for  Section  410(a)\nsuggests  that an  applicant must  always give  the Copyright\nOffice   an   opportunity   to   undertake   an   appropriate\n                         \nexamination.\n\n                             -31-\n                              31\n\nexamines   the   deposit  to   determine  the   existence  of\n\ncopyrightable authorship.\"   54 Fed. Reg. 13,173 (1989).   In\n\norder  to allow the Office to continue this practice, the new\n\nregulations provide, for  example, that when  the applicant's\n\ndeposit  contains   portions  of   the  source  code   of  an\n\nunpublished computer  program with blocked-out  trade secrets\n\nthe  deposit must  still \"reveal[]  an appreciable  amount of\n\noriginal    computer    code.\"        See   37    C.F.R.     \n                                         \n\n202.20(c)(2)(vii)(A)(2) (emphasis added).  On the other hand,\n\nwhere  there are  no  blocked-out portions  in the  deposited\n\nportions  of  a  computer  program, the  regulations  do  not\n\nspecifically require that the deposit contain \"an appreciable\n\namount  of  original computer  code.\"   In  other  words, the\n\nCopyright Office seems to have assumed that in such cases the\n\ndeposited pages are likely  to contain sufficient elements of\n\noriginal expression to determine the copyrightability  of the\n\nwork at issue.  At any rate,  it appears that Congress viewed\n\nthe deposit requirement as  a means of collecting information\n\nthat the Copyright Office  may use in resolving  the question\n\nof copyrightability for the purposes of Section 410.26\n\n                    \n\n26.  Another  objective of  Section 408(b)  might be  to give\nwould-be  infringers  notice of  the  extent  of their  civil\nliability.    Yet, this  can  hardly have  been  an important\nlegislative  goal  because  a  copyright  owner  is  free  to\nregister any time before  filing suit, even after the  act of\n                                                 \ninfringement.

Quite  naturally,  one  important  function  of  a\n\nregistration application is to identify the work in which the\n\napplicant claims a  copyright.  See 17  U.S.C.   409 (1988  &amp;\n                                   \n\nSupp. IV 1992) (requiring application to include, inter alia,\n                                                            \n\ntitle  of work,  dates of  completion and  publication, along\n\nwith \"any  other information  . .  . bearing upon  the .  . .\n\nidentification of the work\").  Furthermore, like the deposit,\n\nthe    application   also    provides   some    evidence   of\n\ncopyrightability,  because it  must identify  any preexisting\n\nwork from which the author borrowed in creating a compilation\n\nor derivative  work.  See  17 U.S.C.    409(9).   Indeed, the\n                         \n\nCopyright  Office may often be in a better position to assess\n\nthe  originality of the work  being registered by reviewing a\n\n                    \n\nPublications,  Inc., 878 F.2d 138,  140 (4th Cir.  1989).  In\n                   \naddition,  because   Congress  had  included   a  recordation\nrequirement elsewhere  in the copyright laws  until 1988, see\n                                                             \n17 U.S.C.A.   205(d)  (West 1977) (providing that recordation\nof  transfer   of  copyright  ownership  is  prerequisite  to\ninfringement  suit by transferee), but  did not do  so in the\ncontext of Section 408, we may infer that affording notice to\npotential infringers was not Congress's primary motivation in\ndrafting   Section  408(b).      See  City   of  Chicago   v.\n                                                        \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, 114 S.

And   yet,  an\n\ninadvertent  failure  to  identify  preexisting  works  on an\n\napplication  is  treated   no  differently  from   any  other\n\napplication  error.   See, e.g.,  Toy Loft,  684 F.2d  at 828\n                                          \n\n(analyzing in  similar fashion  failure to  mention co-author\n\nand failure to mention preexisting works).\n\n          We conclude  that  there is  no support  in law  or\n\nreason for  a  rule that  penalizes  immaterial,  inadvertent\n\nerrors in a  copyright deposit.27   Accordingly,  we find  no\n\nflaw in the district court's instruction that such errors \"do\n\nnot impeach the validity and effect of the registration.\"\n\n               b.  Material Errors in the Copyright Deposit\n                                                           \n\n                    \n\n27.  Contrary to Grumman's vigorous assertions,  this court's\nopinion in Unistrut  Corp. v.  Power, 280 F.2d  18 (1st  Cir.\n                                    \n1960),  does  not compel  a different  rule.   In  that case,\nplaintiff  claimed infringement  of the  1942 edition  of its\ncatalog but apparently sought  to prove unauthorized  copying\nat trial  by demonstrating the similarity  of the defendant's\nwork  to  the 1943  edition  of  plaintiff's catalog,  \"which\nadmittedly contained  some, unspecified, additions.\"   Id. at\n                                                          \n23.   Because \"there  was no proof that  copies of this later\nedition were  deposited with the Copyright  Office, and there\nwas no proof that the infringed material was contained in the\n1942  edition,\" we held that there  was insufficient proof of\ninfringement  of  the earlier  edition.    Id.   Unistrut  is\n                                                         \ndistinguishable in at least two respects.  First, our opinion\nin Unistrut  does not  suggest that the  plaintiff mistakenly\n           \ndeposited  the 1943  edition  when attempting  to register  a\ncopyright  claim concerning the 1942 edition; hence, Unistrut\n                                                             \ncannot  serve  as authority  on  the  legal ramifications  of\nregistration errors.  Second, in  this case there is evidence\nthat sections of source  code from ADEX Revisions 0.0  to 2.0\nwere  among the  pages deposited  with the  Copyright Office,\n    \neven  if other portions  of the deposited  material came from\nother computer programs.\n\n                             -34-\n                              34\n\n          The law is not quite as settled as to the effect of\n\nan application  error  that is  inadvertent  but  nonetheless\n\nmaterial.    No  court  has  suggested  that  a  registration\n\npremised  in part  on an  unintentional material  error would\n\nfail  to satisfy  the jurisdictional  requirement  of Section\n\n411(a).  At the  same time, at least one court  has suggested\n\nthat in  such  instances  the proper  approach  might  be  to\n\nprevent  the  plaintiff from  exploiting  the  presumption of\n\nvalidity  that ordinarily attaches  to a registered copyright\n\nunder Section 410(c).   Masquerade Novelty,  912 F.2d at  668\n                                          \n\nn.5  (dictum).  We assume for argument's sake that a material\n\nerror  in a  copyright  deposit, even  if unintentional,  may\n\ndestroy the presumption of validity.\n\n               c.   Refusal  to Compel  Production of  Source\n                                                             \n\nCode\n    \n\n          Grumman  next argues that  it was unfairly deprived\n\nof  an opportunity to prove  that the errors  in the deposits\n\nwere   material.    Specifically,  Grumman  claims  that  the\n\ndistrict court abused its  discretion when, during the trial,\n\nit  refused to compel DG  to produce roughly  40,000 pages of\n\nsource code  (on approximately 33,000 floppy  disks) for each\n\nof  the first  three  versions of  ADEX (0.0  to  2.0).   See\n                                                             \n\nGeremia v. First Nat'l Bank, 653 F.2d 1, 5-6  (1st Cir. 1981)\n                           \n\n(reviewing denial of mid-trial  discovery motion for abuse of\n\ndiscretion). \n\n                             -35-\n                              35\n\n          Grumman renewed its unsuccessful pre-trial requests\n\nfor the source code after Edward Gove, a DG witness, admitted\n\non  cross-examination  that  there  were  some  discrepancies\n\nbetween the  source code deposited with  the Copyright Office\n\nand  the actual  source code  for ADEX  0.0 to 2.0,  and then\n\nexplained in rebuttal testimony  that those errors were minor\n\nand  of no  consequence to  the operation  of  the diagnostic\n\nprogram  as a whole.  In response  to the renewed request, DG\n\nprovided Grumman  with those portions of the source codes for\n\nADEX Revisions 0.0 to  2.0 necessary to conduct  a character-\n\nby-character  comparison of  the intended deposits  of source\n\ncode   with  those   portions   of   source   code   actually\n\ndeposited.28    Nonetheless,  Grumman insisted  that  it  was\n\nentitled to the entire source code for all three versions.\n\n          Grumman apparently sought the three  sets of source\n\ncode  because it believed that  analysis of the entire source\n\ncode would  permit a more effective  cross-examination of the\n\nDG witness  about the  magnitude of the  discrepancies during\n\nDG's rebuttal.  It seems that Grumman had one main  goal:  it\n\nbelieved  it  might  be  able  to  show  that,  although  the\n\ndiscrepancies  were  few in  number  and  seemingly minor  in\n\ncharacter,  ADEX would  not function  properly if  the source\n\n                    \n\n28.  In its brief, DG states that \"Data General collected and\nprovided to Grumman copies  of the entire source code  of all\nof  the sub-programs that were, or should have been, filed in\nthe  Copyright Office for  each of the  relevant revisions of\nMV/ADEX.\"  Grumman does not challenge this assertion.\n\n                             -36-\n                              36\n\ncode deposited  with the  Copyright Office had  been inserted\n\ninto the versions of ADEX DG intended to register.\n\n          The marginal  benefit to Grumman  of obtaining  the\n\nbalance  of the source code was at best highly uncertain, and\n\nall  indications  were that  such  a  test would  produce  no\n\ncompelling results.   Even if Grumman  could demonstrate that\n\ninserting  the errors would impair  the operation of ADEX, it\n\nis  extremely  unlikely   that  this   would  establish   the\n\nmateriality  of the errors.  Grumman does not allege that any\n\nof the errors,  if discovered, would  have led the  Copyright\n\nOffice  to refuse registration of DG's copyright claims.  Nor\n\ndoes  Grumman contend  that the  Copyright Office  would have\n\nbeen  unable to use the  correct portions of  the deposits to\n\nidentify  the  works  DG  intended  to  register  or  make  a\n\npreliminary determination concerning the  copyrightability of\n\nthose  works.29    In  contrast, DG  produced  evidence  that\n\n                    \n\n29.  If a  showing  of prejudice  is  necessary to  enable  a\ndefendant  to use  a registration  error as  a defense  to an\ninfringement action, see supra note 24, Grumman has failed in\n                              \nthis  respect as well because  Grumman has not  shown that it\nwas misled as to  the copyrightability of ADEX  Revisions 0.0\nto 2.0.  It appears that Grumman has always acted in a manner\nconsistent  with  the  belief  that  each  revision  of  ADEX\ncontains  copyrightable  elements.    In  these  proceedings,\nmoreover, Grumman  has never seriously argued  that the first\nthree  versions  of  ADEX  are entirely  devoid  of  original\ncomputer  code, and  has consistently  admitted that  it made\nidentical copies  of the entire  contents of each  version of\nADEX at issue in this action.   Accordingly, we are unable to\nsee why Grumman  was disadvantaged by  bearing the burden  of\nproving that there are no copyrightable elements in the first\nthree versions of  ADEX, a  task even Grumman  seems to  have\nforsworn.\n\n                             -37-\n                              37\n\nproduction of  the requested  material would be  an extremely\n\ncumbersome process,  a point  Grumman does not  contest.   We\n\nfind no abuse of discretion  in the district court's decision\n\nto deny Grumman's mid-trial discovery request.\n\n          2.

Grumman  insists  that   acquisition  of   copyrightable\nsoftware  in  violation  of  confidentiality   agreements  is\nequivalent to  unauthorized copying  where, as appears  to be\nthe  case here,  the defendant  does not  actually learn  the\n                                                        \ntrade  secrets embodied  in  the software.   The  qualitative\ndifference between unauthorized copying  and such acts as the\ndiscovery  of  wrongfully  acquired  trade  secrets  and  the\nillegal use of that  knowledge may be more striking  than the\ndifference    between    unauthorized   copying    and   mere\nparticipation in  the breach of a  confidentiality agreement.\nBut  we cannot agree that  the latter relationship  is one of\nequivalence.\n\n                             -40-\n                              40\n\nthat \"wrongful acquisition\" is  an element of a Massachusetts\n\ntrade  secrets  claim, and  that  \"[a]cquisition  of a  trade\n\nsecret is wrongful .  . . if it is by theft of property known\n\nto belong  to another,  or  by knowing  participation in  the\n                                                             \n\nbreach of an express or implied confidentiality agreement by,\n                                                         \n\nfor instance, a former employee or customer of Data General.\"\n\n(Emphasis  added.)   Grumman does  not assign  error  to this\n\nportion  of the  charge, which  thus becomes  the law  of the\n\ncase.  See United States v.

The district  court granted  DG's motion  for\n\npartial  summary  judgment on  this  issue,  and Grumman  now\n\nappeals  that decision  on two  alternative grounds:  (1) the\n\nSettlement Agreement unambiguously  grants Grumman a  license\n\nto  use ADEX;  or (2)  the Settlement  Agreement is  at least\n\nambiguous, and conflicting extrinsic evidence about the scope\n\nof  the   license  presents  a  factual   dispute  worthy  of\n\nresolution by a jury.   \n\n               a.

Areas of Agreement\n                                     \n\n          In order to focus  our analysis of DG's entitlement\n\nto  summary  judgment,  we   first  determine  the  reach  of\n\nGrumman's  contentions  in light  of  the  existing areas  of\n\nagreement.\n\n          In  the first  place,  the parties  agree that  the\n\nexistence  and scope of a  license turn on the interpretation\n\nof  the  \"maintenance or  repair\"  exception  to the  general\n\nprohibition  of paragraph four  of the  Settlement Agreement,\n\nwhich provides that Grumman's predecessor \"will not, directly\n\nor indirectly, copy  or utilize `Proprietary  Information' of\n\nDG  for the design or  manufacture of computers  or any other\n\npurpose.\"34    In addition,  DG  admits  that the  Settlement\n\nAgreement  gives  Grumman  a  right   to  use  some  of  DG's\n\n                    \n\n34.  In its entirety, paragraph four reads as follows:\n\n               4.    Defendants [CSSC,  Lloyd Root,\n          and Robert Montgomery] agree, jointly and\n          severally, that they  will not,  directly\n          or    indirectly,    copy   or    utilize\n          \"Proprietary Information\" of DGC  for the\n          design or manufacture of computers or any\n          other purpose except  [i] maintenance  or\n          repair    of    DGC    equipment,    [ii]\n          installation and integration of equipment\n          manufactured or sold  by companies  other\n          than   DGC,   or  [iii]   other  purposes\n          permitted    by   any    proprietary   or\n          confidentiality  legends  accompanying or\n          made  part of  any data  or documentation\n          comprising    Proprietary    Information.\n          \"Proprietary  Information\"  of DGC  shall\n          mean  data  and  documentation  which  is\n          marked confidential or proprietary to DGC\n          by appropriate legend.\n\n                             -44-\n                              44\n\nproprietary  information  for  some  purposes.   Although  DG\n\ndenies that  the Settlement  Agreement allows Grumman  to use\n\nADEX  itself,  DG  nonetheless  admitted in  its  answers  to\n\nGrumman's  request  for  admissions  \"that, as  part  of  the\n\nsettlement of  the CSSC litigation, Data  General agreed that\n\nCSSC could use Data  General proprietary information that was\n\ndefined in the  Agreement and  the nature of  which was  then\n\nunderstood  by and agreed to  by the parties,  to maintain or\n\nrepair  Data  General  computers.\"    While   the  Settlement\n\nAgreement does not bear  many of the traits of  a traditional\n\nlicensing  agreement, it  does grant  some permission  to use\n\nDG's   intellectual    property,   at   least    in   certain\n\ncircumstances,   and   therefore   creates   some   type   of\n\n\"license.\"35   Consequently, Grumman's  defense turns  on the\n\nscope of the license.36\n     \n\n                    \n\n35.  Because neither party has  offered a legal definition of\na  license, we  will regard  the term  as carrying  its usual\ndefinition:    permission to  use  the  property of  another.\nBlack's  Law Dictionary 829-30 (5th ed. 1979).  A license can\n                       \nbe general,  with few or  no restrictions, or  quite limited.\nThe  use of  the  word \"license\"  in  a contract  is  clearly\nevidence of an intent  to permit use, but the  absence of the\nword  is not dispositive, as long  as other contract language\ngrants some permission  to use.  Cf. 3 Nimmer    10.03[A], at\n                                             \n10-38  (explaining  that  \"[a] nonexclusive  license  may  be\ngranted  orally,  or  may  even  be  implied  from  conduct\")\n(footnotes omitted).\n\n36.  DG argues that the Settlement Agreement was not intended\nto  apply  to proprietary  information  created  by DG  after\nsettlement  of the  1975  lawsuit.   We  cannot agree.    The\nlanguage  \"`Proprietary Information'  of  DGC\" strikes  us as\nunambiguous,  and unqualifiedly  embraces all  DG proprietary\n                                             \n\n                             -45-\n                              45\n\n          Also worthy of note are undisputed facts concerning\n\nthe nature of Grumman's acquisition and use of ADEX.  Grumman\n\ndid not  simply gain  access to  copies of  ADEX left  at the\n                            \n\nsites of  former DG service customers solely  for the purpose\n\nof using  on-site maintenance  tools to service  computers at\n\nthat  site.   Rather,  Grumman acquired  copies of  ADEX from\n                                       \n\nformer  service  customers in  an  effort to  expand  its own\n\nlibrary of MV diagnostic software,  which Grumman technicians\n\nfreely copied  and used  in servicing  the  computers of  any\n\nGrumman customer with  MV equipment.   Moreover, there is  no\n\nevidence that Grumman acquired  ADEX from equipment owners at\n\na time when those equipment owners were also customers of DG.\n\nNor  is there  evidence that  Grumman acquired  ADEX directly\n\nfrom  DG,  or  from current  or  former  CMO  customers.   In\n\naddition, the  record reveals that DG  service customers were\n\ncontractually bound  both to  prevent ADEX from  falling into\n\nthe hands of third parties such as  TPMs and to return copies\n\nof ADEX to DG  after the termination of the  relevant service\n\nagreement.37    Thus,  Grumman   acquired  ADEX  from   those\n\n                    \n\ninformation, whether in  existence in 1976 or not.   However,\neven  if the  phrase were  ambiguous, an  examination  of the\nextrinsic  evidence  reveals  that  DG  would  still  not  be\nentitled to summary judgment on  this basis because there  is\nextrinsic evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find\nthat  the  Settlement  Agreement  was intended  to  apply  to\ninformation in the future.\n\n37.  For  example, in  one  version of  DG's On-Call  Service\nAgreement, service customers agreed  \"NOT TO DISCLOSE OR MAKE\nAVAILABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY THE PROPRIETARY ITEMS [installed\n\n                             -46-\n                              46\n\ncustomers who no longer had lawful  possession of the program\n\nand had no right to transfer it.38 \n\n          The  question  we  must  resolve  is  whether   the\n\n\"maintenance  or repair\" exception authorized Grumman both to\n\ngain access to and  acquire copies of ADEX in  the possession\n\nof former  DG service customers  despite the fact  that these\n\ncustomers  had agreed  not only  to prevent  such third-party\n\naccess but  also to  return copies  of ADEX  to DG after  the\n\ntermination of their service contract.\n\n                    \n\nat customer  locations by DG;]  AND . .  . TO RETURN  ALL THE\nPROPRIETARY    ITEMS    TO    [DG]    UPON    EXPIRATION   OR\nCANCELLATION/TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.\"\n\n38.  Grumman  also acquired  copies  of ADEX  from former  DG\nemployees who brought  copies of  the program  with them,  in\nviolation of  their employment agreements.   Grumman does not\nmaintain  that the Settlement Agreement gives it the right to\nduplicate and use copies of ADEX acquired in this manner.\n\n                             -47-\n                              47\n\n               d.  Scope of the License  \n                                       \n\n          The plain language of the Settlement Agreement does\n\nnot answer our question.  Despite the fact that the exception\n\nanticipates  that   Grumman  will   \"copy   or  utilize\"   DG\n\nproprietary information  for the  \"maintenance and repair  of\n\nDGC  equipment,\" the  Settlement Agreement  does not  specify\n\nwhether it merely refers to Grumman's right to gain access to\n\nmaintenance tools it finds at a customer  site (including the\n\nroutine  copying  and  use inherent  in  the  operation  of a\n\ncomputer program),  or whether the  exception somehow  allows\n\nGrumman to acquire such tools for the service of DG computers\n\nat other sites.  Similarly, the Settlement Agreement contains\n\nno prescription for resolving potential conflicts between the\n\n\"maintenance  or repair\"  exception  and  provisions in  DG's\n\nService Agreement  prohibiting third-party access  during the\n\nterm  of  the  Agreement  and  retention  of  DG  proprietary\n\ninformation  thereafter.     Accordingly,  we   turn  to  the\n\nextrinsic evidence in the record in an attempt to resolve the\n\nambiguity.\n\n          Even  when  viewed in  a  light  most favorable  to\n\nGrumman, the record evidence makes  clear that the parties to\n\nthe   Settlement  Agreement  intended  the  \"maintenance  and\n\nrepair\" exception to function as what we shall call a \"third-\n\nparty access agreement,\" allowing CSSC, Grumman's predecessor\n\nin interest,  to gain access to  proprietary information that\n\n                             -48-\n                              48\n\nDG sold, licensed,  or otherwise  entrusted to  owners of  DG\n\nequipment.   For example, when  called to testify  in the STI\n                                                             \n\nlitigation,  Edward Canfield,  CSSC's  attorney at  the time,\n\nused these words  to describe his  contemporary understanding\n\nof the  \"maintenance and repair\" exception:  \"If the customer\n\nhad it,  [CSSC] had a right  to use it.\"39   In addition, the\n\nlanguage of DG licensing  agreements in the 1970s as  well as\n\nthe pleadings in the 1975 litigation strongly corroborate the\n\nview  that the  settlement  negotiations primarily  concerned\n\nCSSC's right to use  proprietary information in the  hands of\n\nDG  equipment  owners.     As  late  as  1976,   DG  licensed\n\nproprietary maintenance information to equipment owners under\n\nan agreement  which specifically  allowed licensees  to grant\n\naccess  to   third  parties  \"on  LICENSEE's   premises  with\n\nLICENSEE's  permission for  purposes specifically  related to\n\nLICENSEE's use of  the Licensed Program.\"   Moreover, in  its\n\n1975  counterclaim,  CSSC  intimated  that DG  had  begun  to\n\nundermine the ability of  TPMs to gain access to  maintenance\n\ninformation in  the hands of equipment  owners, alleging that\n\nDG  had attempted  \"to prevent  owners of  DGC Mini-computers\n\nfrom having  their equipment  serviced and maintained  by any\n\ncompetitor of DGC  . . . by restricting the  use those owners\n\nmake of their owner maintenance information.\"\n\n                    \n\n39.  The district  court accepted a transcript  of Canfield's\ntestimony  in STI as part  of the summary  judgment record in\n                 \nthis case. \n\n                             -49-\n                              49\n\n          There is also specific evidence that the parties to\n\nthe  Settlement  Agreement  were  not  negotiating about  the\n\nongoing transfer of proprietary information directly from  DG\n\nto CSSC.   For example, during the  STI trial, counsel for DG\n                                       \n\nasked Canfield  whether, under  the Settlement Agreement,  DG\n\nhad  an \"obligation  to  give [CSSC]  something.\"   \"No sir,\"\n\nreplied  Canfield, \"Data General was  not offering to give us\n\nanything.\"\n\n          The   nature  of   the  \"maintenance   and  repair\"\n\nexception  as  a  third-party  access  agreement  has several\n\nramifications.  As  a provision designed to ensure  access to\n\nGrumman,  the  exception  was arguably  intended  to override\n\ncontrary    restrictions    in   proprietary    legends   and\n\nconfidentiality agreements.   Indeed, there is  evidence that\n\nthis was the case.  A  letter to Canfield from Carl Kaplan, a\n\nlawyer who  represented  DG in  the settlement  negotiations,\n\noutlined  the  proposed  settlement,  stating  that  improper\n\nutilization of  DG proprietary information \"would  be the use\n\nof  that information other than  as marked by  DGC or without\n                                                     \n\nDGC's express written permission.\"  (Emphasis added.)  Kaplan\n\nadded  that \"[u]se  of  DGC proprietary  information for  the\n\nmaintenance of DGC equipment would expressly be permitted the\n\ndefendants.\"    Id.    In  addition,   Canfield's  deposition\n                   \n\ntestimony suggests  that his primary  concern was  for DG  to\n\nguarantee  CSSC's  right   to  use  proprietary   information\n\n                             -50-\n                              50\n\ndistributed  to DG  equipment owners,  notwithstanding future\n\nrestrictions  on  third-party  access  to  such  information.\n\nThus, a  jury could  reasonably conclude that  the Settlement\n\nAgreement allowed  Grumman to  gain access to  information in\n\nthe  hands  of  DG  equipment   owners  for  the  purpose  of\n\nmaintaining DG computers, even  if equipment owners generally\n\ncould  not  allow  third  parties access  to  DG  proprietary\n\ninformation.\n\n          Characterizing  the  exception  as   a  third-party\n\naccess  agreement  also means  that  Grumman's  right to  use\n\ncopies  of ADEX in the  possession of DG  equipment owners is\n\nnecessarily  derivative of  the  rights  of  those  equipment\n\nowners.   As  a consequence,  Grumman only  has the  right to\n\noperate a customer's  copy of  ADEX for the  benefit of  that\n       \n\ncustomer; there is no basis for the proposition  that Grumman\n\ncan use its  third-party access rights  to acquire copies  of\n                                                  \n\nADEX for unlimited copying  and use in the service of  any MV\n\ncomputer.    Indeed,  this   was  the  import  of  Canfield's\n\ntestimony in STI.  Referring to a CSSC customer as a \"party,\"\n                \n\nCanfield stated  that he understood the  Settlement Agreement\n\nto  allow  \"[CSSC]  to  use whatever  [was]  on  the  party's\n\nequipment  . .  .  for the  repair  and maintenance  of  that\n                                                             \n\nparty's equipment.\"    (Emphasis added).40   Furthermore,  to\n                 \n\n                    \n\n40.  We note in passing that STI appeared to adopt Canfield's\nstatement  in the course of  the STI trial.   When Judge Motz\n                                    \ncharacterized   Canfield's   testimony   as    stating   that\n\n                             -51-\n                              51\n\nthe extent that an equipment owner no longer has the right to\n\npossess copies of ADEX, as in the case of a former DG service\n\ncustomer,   Grumman's   rights   as   a   third   party   are\n\nextinguished.41\n\n          In   summary,  we  conclude   that  the  Settlement\n\nAgreement  merely grants Grumman the right  to gain access to\n\ncopies  of ADEX lawfully possessed by a DG equipment owner in\n\norder to  service the computers of  that particular equipment\n\nowner.   Because Grumman's copying  and use of  ADEX does not\n\nfall within this category,  the Settlement Agreement does not\n\n                    \n\nproprietary  maintenance   tools  in  the  hands   of  CSSC's\ncustomers  \"were to  be used  . .  . for  the  customer's own\ncomputers,\"   counsel  for  STI responded,  \"I  don't have  a\nproblem with that.\"\n\n41.  Our   conclusion  that   the  \"maintenance   or  repair\"\nexception was  intended to be a  third-party access agreement\nalso  disposes of  Grumman's  assertion  that the  Settlement\nAgreement  somehow obligates DG to distribute its proprietary\nmaintenance  information  either  to  Grumman's  customers or\ndirectly  to  Grumman.   As  explained  above, the  extrinsic\nevidence demonstrates  that the Agreement  concerns Grumman's\nright  to  gain access  to  proprietary  information that  DG\ndistributes to equipment owners.   Nowhere does the Agreement\nsay   that  DG   will  distribute   to  Grumman   proprietary\ninformation DG  chooses to distribute  only to its  own field\nengineers.   Further, it  would be unreasonable  to interpret\nthe   Agreement  as   providing  for   direct   licensing  of\nproprietary  information on demand  given that  the Agreement\ndid not even  allow the individual  parties to the  Agreement\n(Root and Montgomery, both former  DG employees) to retain or\npurchase any  proprietary  information they  acquired  during\ntheir employment with DG.   And finally, a mere  agreement to\nagree to an unspecified future license would be unenforceable\nas  a matter of contract  law.  See STI,  737 F. Supp. at 339\n                                       \n(citing First Nat'l Bank  v. Burton, Parsons &amp; Co.,  470 A.2d\n                                                  \n822,  828 (Md. Ct. Spec.

Misuse Defense\n                  \n\n          Grumman claims  that DG is not  entitled to enforce\n\nits copyrights  or its rights  under state trade  secrets law\n\nbecause it has \"misused\" those property rights by engaging in\n\nanti-competitive  behavior in violation  of federal antitrust\n\nlaws.   DG argues that there is no \"copyright misuse\" defense\n\nto a  federal copyright infringement claim  and no applicable\n\n\"unclean   hands\"   defense   to   the    state   claim   for\n\nmisappropriation of trade secrets.  Alternatively,  DG argues\n\nthat it did not violate the antitrust laws.\n\n          A \"copyright misuse\"  defense is not  without legal\n\nsupport.  In a carefully reasoned opinion, the Fourth Circuit\n\nrecently  approved such  a defense after  noting that  it has\n\nlong  been  recognized in  the  analogous  context of  patent\n\ninfringement.   See Lasercomb America, Inc.  v. Reynolds, 911\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 970, 976  (4th Cir. 1990) (\"[S]ince copyright and patent\n\nlaw  serve  parallel  public  interests,  a  `misuse' defense\n\nshould apply  to infringement  actions  brought to  vindicate\n\neither right.\"); see also  3 Nimmer   13.09[A], at  13-269 to\n                                   \n\n13-276  (collecting conflicting  decisions of  lower courts);\n\nRamsey  Hanna,  Note,  Misusing  Antitrust:  The  Search  for\n                                                             \n\nFunctional Copyright Misuse Standards,  46 Stan.

Although DG correctly notes that the misuse\n\nin   Lasercomb  (conditioning   a  copyright  license   on  a\n              \n\n                             -54-\n                              54\n\nnoncompetition  agreement)  is not  identical  to  the misuse\n\nalleged in this case (tying access to ADEX to the purchase of\n\nDG  service  and  refusing  to license  ADEX  to  TPMs),  the\n\nreasoning of  Lasercomb does not turn on  the particular type\n                       \n\nof anti-competitive behavior alleged.   DG also suggests that\n\nthe policy rationale for a copyright misuse defense is weaker\n\nthan  in the case of patent misuse because an exclusive right\n\nto express an  idea in  a particular way  (a copyright) is  a\n\nlesser threat to competition  than an exclusive right to  use\n\nthe  idea itself (a patent).  We acknowledge that it is often\n\nmore difficult to prove an antitrust violation when the claim\n\nrests  on the  questionable  market power  associated with  a\n\ncopyright,  but  that would  not be  a  reason to  prohibit a\n\ndefendant from  attempting to meet  its burden of  proof, and\n\nwould be a poor reason to refrain entirely from recognizing a\n\ncopyright misuse defense.\n\n          Nevertheless,  this case  does  not require  us  to\n\ndecide  whether the  federal copyright  law permits  a misuse\n\ndefense.     Nor  need  we  determine  whether  Massachusetts\n\nrecognizes  an   unclean  hands   defense  to  a   claim  for\n\nmisappropriation of  trade secrets.   Grumman does  not claim\n\nthat  DG misused  its copyright or  acted inequitably  in any\n\nfashion  other than  through  its alleged  violations of  the\n\n                             -55-\n                              55\n\nSherman  Act.42   And,  because  we  conclude infra,  Section\n                                                   \n\nIII.B.,  that there  is  insufficient evidence  to justify  a\n\ntrial  on   either  of  Grumman's   antitrust  counterclaims,\n\nGrumman's misuse  and  unclean  hands  defenses  are  equally\n\ndevoid of merit.43\n\n          5.

Note  that the  Lasercomb  court held  that a  copyright\n                              \nmisuse  defense  does  not  require  proof  of  an  antitrust\nviolation,  only proof that \"the copyright is being used in a\nmanner violative of  the public policy embodied in  the grant\nof a copyright.\"  911 F.2d at 978.  \n\n43.  Even if Grumman's antitrust counterclaims  could survive\nsummary judgment,  Grumman  would not  necessarily  have  the\nprivilege  of  interposing  its  counterclaims  as  defenses.\nLasercomb explains  that copyright misuse  and its  ancestor,\n         \npatent  misuse, are equitable defenses.  See 911 F.2d at 976-\n                                            \n77.  If copyright misuse is an equitable defense, a defendant\nthat  has itself  acted inequitably  may  not be  entitled to\nraise such a defense.  Cf. 3 Nimmer   13.09[B],  at 13-278 to\n                                   \n13-279 (noting the possible propriety of denying a defense of\nunclean hands \"when the defendant has been  guilty of conduct\nmore  unconscionable and  unworthy  than  the  plaintiff's\").\nMere  infringement may  not  be inequitable  in this  context\nbecause a  misuse defense would  appear to sanction  at least\nsome infringement as a  necessary measure of self-help.   But\nviolation of  a valid injunction against further infringement\nissued   pursuant  to  a   court's  equitable   powers  would\nconstitute blatantly  inequitable behavior.   Here,  the jury\nspecifically found that Grumman violated the district court's\n1988  injunction against the use  of ADEX.   Grumman does not\nappeal that finding.  Accordingly, while Grumman may be  free\nto pursue antitrust  counterclaims, cf. Perma Life  Mufflers,\n                                                             \nInc.  v.

At the same time, the plaintiff need not prove its\n\nloss  of revenue  with  mathematical precision.

In\n\n                             -59-\n                              59\n\nopposition,  Grumman  introduced evidence  that  ADEX  was of\n\nlittle  use to  Grumman's field  engineers  and only  a minor\n\nfactor  in consumer's  selection  of a  service  vendor.   In\n\neffect, Grumman  argued that,  even  without ADEX,  customers\n\nwould have switched to (or remained with) Grumman in order to\n\ntake  advantage of  its  lower prices  and allegedly  higher-\n\nquality service.\n\n          In  its  objections  to  the jury  charge,  Grumman\n\nexpressed   concerns  about   the  court's   instructions  on\n\ncausation in the  lost profits  context.   Grumman asked  the\n\ncourt  to  instruct the  jury that  it  was free  to consider\n\nwhether  factors other  than  Grumman's infringement  enabled\n\nGrumman  to  win  customers  from  DG.    On  appeal, Grumman\n\ncontinues to  challenge the adequacy of  the district court's\n\ninstructions on causation, and raises several questions about\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence.\n\n               (1)  Jury Instructions\n                                     \n\n          The district  court's charge, relevant  portions of\n\nwhich  are set  forth  in the  margin,  invited the  jury  to\n\nconsider  the \"diverse  factors\"  that make  up a  customer's\n\nchoice of  a service  organization, and properly  allowed the\n\njury to consider whether the majority of MV equipment  owners\n\nwould have turned to DG for service had Grumman not possessed\n\n                             -60-\n                              60\n\nand used ADEX.44   The instructions also introduced  the jury\n\nto  the  concept of  proximate cause.    The charge  not only\n\nmentioned the concept  by name  but also gave  it content  by\n\nexplaining, among other things, that the plaintiff \"bears the\n\nburden  of proving  its  damages to  a  reasonable degree  of\n\ncertainty,\" may  not be compensated for  \"purely speculative\"\n\ndamages, and is  entitled only to  \"reasonable\" damages.   We\n\nconclude  that the  charge  adequately equipped  the jury  to\n\ndetermine  whether or  not DG  had established  the requisite\n\ncausal link between Grumman's infringement and the profits DG\n\nclaimed to have lost.45\n\n                    \n\n44.  In its charge, the district court stated:\n\n          If  you conclude  that Grumman  would not\n          have been in the business of servicing MV\n          computers but for its possession  and use\n          of  MV/ADEX,  or  that  some  or  all  of\n          Grumman's customers would not  have hired\n          Grumman  to  maintain  or   repair  their\n          computers  if  Grumman had  not infringed\n          Data   General's  copyrights,   then  you\n          should consider what percentage  of those\n          customers would have  done business  with\n          Data General instead.\n\n               You  may take  into account  all the\n          diverse factors which . . . might bear on\n          the   determination,   including   price,\n          customer  loyalty  and level  of customer\n          satisfaction.\n\n45.  Grumman's  other challenges to the jury instructions are\neither meritless  or moot.   First,  Grumman  claims that  an\napportionment  instruction  (the  subject  of  the  following\nsection) would have affected the outcome  of the lost profits\nanalysis.    As we  explained  above,  however, the  district\ncourt's instructions enabled the  jury to make findings about\nthe relative role of  infringing and noninfringing factors in\n\n                             -61-\n                              61\n\n               (2)  Sufficiency of the Evidence\n                                               \n\n          Grumman's  challenge to  the evidentiary  basis for\n\nthe  jury's award  of actual  damages is  less developed  and\n\nequally  unavailing.   Upsetting a jury's  damage award  is a\n\ndaunting  task  for  any  appellant, for  we  must  draw  all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor  of the verdict, upholding the\n\naward if it  derives from \"any rational appraisal or estimate\n\nof the damages that could be based on the evidence before the\n\njury.\"   Anthony v. G.M.D.  Airline Servs., 17  F.3d 490, 493\n                                          \n\n(1st  Cir.  1994)  (citations  and  internal  quotation marks\n\nomitted).     The  likelihood  of  a   victorious  appeal  is\n\nespecially remote in the  absence of rigorous  argumentation.\n\nCf. Chakrabarti v. Cohen,      F.3d    ,     (1st  Cir. 1994)\n                        \n\n[Nos. 92-1987 and  92-1988, slip op. at  8] (suggesting that,\n\nwhen  challenging  the   sufficiency  of   the  evidence,   a\n\n                    \n\ncustomers' selection of Grumman over DG.  Further examination\nof the value added  by Grumman to its own products would have\nbeen  unnecessary.   Second,  Grumman  contends  that it  was\nimpermissible for DG to  calculate its lost profits based  on\nits  monopoly  prices.   This  argument  is untimely  because\nGrumman did not  raise this  issue in its  objections to  the\njury instructions.  In any event, Grumman has not established\nthat DG's  exploitation of  its monopoly is  unlawful, infra,\n                                                            \nSection III.B.2., and  has not provided any authority for the\nproposition that actual  damages cannot be based  on the loss\nof lawful monopoly profits.  Third, Grumman suggests that the\n         \ndamage  award was  inflated because  the jury  was improperly\nforbidden  from  considering the  extent  to  which the  1976\nSettlement  Agreement  authorized  Grumman's  use   of  ADEX.\nHowever, as illustrated supra, Section III.A.3.,  Grumman did\n                             \nnot   present  trialworthy   evidence  that   the  Settlement\nAgreement authorized the  acquisition and use of ADEX  in any\nmeaningful sense.\n\n                             -62-\n                              62\n\ndefendant-appellant  must  make a  \"serious effort  . .  . to\n\nanalyze the evidence taking it in the light most favorable to\n\n[the  plaintiff] and  resolving  credibility issues  in  [the\n\nplaintiff's]  favor\").   Moreover,  the  calculation of  lost\n\nprofits  will always  involve \"some  degree  of speculation.\"\n\nStevens Linen Assocs., 656 F.2d at  14.  As a result, we rely\n                     \n\non the appellant to specify with some precision the manner in\n\nwhich unduly speculative reasoning is likely to have infected\n\nthe jury's verdict.\n\n          Grumman raises several  specific concerns.   First,\n\nGrumman complains that the jury had no basis to conclude that\n\nGrumman would not be  in the MV business because  DG's damage\n\nexpert,  Alan   Friedman,  did  not  consider   the  relative\n\ninfrequency of  Grumman's use of  ADEX, or the  value Grumman\n\nadded  to  its product  through \"substantially  lower prices,\n\nsuperior service and higher level of  customer satisfaction.\"\n\nGrumman's   ultimate  concern   is   that  \"no   attempt   at\n\napportionment was made.\"   But  Friedman did not  set out  to\n\nshow that there was  nothing attractive about Grumman service\n                            \n\napart  from  its possession  and use  of  ADEX.   Instead, he\n\nreported --  and the  jury apparently  believed --  that, for\n\nmost owners of MV equipment, ADEX capability was the critical\n\nattribute  in  a  service  vendor.   As  a  result,  Friedman\n\nconcluded, ADEX capability was the sine qua non  of Grumman's\n                                               \n\nsuccess  in its  chosen  niche as  a  national vendor  of  MV\n\n                             -63-\n                              63\n\nservice.  Drawing all  reasonable inferences in favor  of DG,\n\nwe conclude that a reasonable jury was free to agree.\n\n          Grumman  also  argues  that  the  jury  must   have\n\nimproperly  followed Friedman's  lead in  adding to  the lost\n\nprofits  figure all  of  the service  and  hardware needs  of\n\nGrumman's  MV  customers  that  DG was  capable  of  filling.\n\nGrumman notes  that Friedman based his  testimony on evidence\n\nthat customers prefer to have a single vendor of service, but\n\nclaims that  this  evidence deserves  little  weight  because\n\n\"customers   that  had   gone   to  [Grumman]   had   already\n\ndemonstrated  their  particular  price/service  sensitivity.\"\n\nViewed in a light most favorable to the verdict, however, the\n\nrecord   evidence  adequately  supports  the  inference  that\n\nFriedman invited the  jury to  draw.  For  example, while  MV\n\nequipment owners  may have switched  to Grumman in  search of\n\nlower prices  and better service, the  evidence suggests that\n\nnone of them had to give up  a preference for single sourcing\n\nto  do so.    Indeed, the  evidence  suggests that  Grumman's\n\ndrawing  power was due in part to  its ability to be a single\n\nsource of  service, particularly for customers  with multiple\n\nbrands of  computer equipment.   Nor  did Grumman  attempt to\n\nrebut Friedman's  view with  evidence of MV  equipment owners\n\nwho  sacrificed  their  preference  for  single  sourcing  in\n\n                             -64-\n                              64\n\ncertain  circumstances.46   More  importantly,  Friedman  did\n\nnot presume  that customers would be  entirely insensitive to\n\nissues  of  price and  quality.    In calculating  DG's  lost\n\nprofits, he reduced the figure by an estimate of the business\n\nDG  would  itself  have  lost  to  competition  from  TPMs.47\n\nFinally, we note that DG did not seek compensation for a loss\n\nin \"goodwill\"  or \"market recognition\" that  was difficult to\n\nascertain, cf. Business Trends, 887  F.2d at 404, but  rather\n                              \n\nfor the loss of  a reasonably verifiable number of  customers\n\nwith a limited  and predictable  set of service  needs and  a\n\ndemonstrated  tendency to satisfy those needs by turning to a\n\nsingle  vendor.  In short, the evidence does not suggest that\n\nthe jury's  award of actual damages falls  outside the \"`wide\n\nrange  of arguable  appropriateness.'\"    Toucet v.  Maritime\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n46.  Such rebuttal evidence, if  it existed, should have been\neasily  within Grumman's  reach.   For example,  the evidence\nsuggests that  purchasers of  DG equipment generally  used DG\nservice in the initial  warranty period.  Thus, owners  of DG\nequipment  might  periodically  upgrade a  portion  of  their\nequipment, and therefore there would be times when one  owner\nwill have some newly  upgraded equipment still under warranty\nand some older  equipment no longer under  warranty.  Grumman\ncould  readily have  introduced evidence  that some  of these\nequipment  owners ignored  their single-vendor  preference by\nturning to a TPM for service of equipment not under warranty.\nSimilarly, it would  not have been  difficult for Grumman  to\ndiscredit  Friedman's  opinion  by  showing  that  DG  had  a\nsignificant  number of price-conscious  service customers who\nregularly   turned  to  other  vendors  when  purchasing  new\nequipment, or  that customers who  purchased DG service  on a\n\"time and materials\" basis often used TPMs as well. \n\n47.  In estimating this \"volume loss,\" Friedman assumed that,\nwithout  ADEX, Grumman  would not  have  been among  the TPMs\ncompeting for MV-related business.\n\n                             -65-\n                              65\n\nOverseas  Corp.,  991 F.2d  5,  11 (1st  Cir.  1993) (quoting\n               \n\nWagenmann v.

In the context of infringer's profits, the plaintiff\n\nmust  meet only a minimal burden of proof in order to trigger\n\na  rebuttable presumption  that the defendant's  revenues are\n\nentirely attributable  to the  infringement; the burden  then\n\nshifts to the  defendant to demonstrate  what portion of  its\n\nrevenues represent  profits, and what portion  of its profits\n\nare not traceable to the infringement.  See id.; Frank Music,\n                                                            \n\n772  F.2d at 514; Cream Records, Inc. v. Jos.

Specifically,\n   \n\nSection 504(b) provides:\n\n          In establishing  the infringer's profits,\n          the  copyright  owner   is  required   to\n          present  proof  only  of the  infringer's\n          gross  revenue,  and  the   infringer  is\n          required to  prove his or  her deductible\n          expenses  and  the  elements   of  profit\n          attributable  to  factors other  than the\n          copyrighted work.48\n\n                    \n\n48.  Contrary to DG's unsupported assertions, a  defendant in\na Massachusetts trade secrets action appears to have the same\nright  to ask for apportionment along with the same burden of\nproof.  Citing  17 U.S.C.    504(b) as persuasive  authority,\n\n                             -66-\n                              66\n\n          DG  introduced  evidence that,  of  Grumman's gross\n\nrevenue from  MV-related business  during the period  1984 to\n\n1990, $5.4 million consisted  of business eliminated from the\n\ncalculation of DG's lost profits.  Although no further  proof\n\nwas required,  DG accepted Grumman's estimates  of its profit\n\nmargin, and  concluded that Grumman's  nonduplicative profits\n\namounted  to  approximately  $1.6  million.49    Anticipating\n\nGrumman's  attempt to  prove the  need for  apportionment, DG\n\nalso argued that, without  ADEX, Grumman would not have  been\n\nin  the MV  service business  on a  national scale,  and that\n\n                    \n\nthe Massachusetts  Supreme Judicial  Court has set  forth the\nfollowing rule for apportionment in trade secrets cases:\n\n          Once  a  plaintiff  demonstrates  that  a\n          defendant made a profit  from the sale of\n          products  produced by  improper use  of a\n          trade  secret, the  burden shifts  to the\n          defendant  to   demonstrate  those  costs\n          properly to be offset against  its profit\n          and   the   portion    of   its    profit\n          attributable  to  factors other  than the\n          trade secret.\n\nUSM  Corp. v.

This amount  included DG's estimated  \"volume loss\"  and\n\"excluded revenue.\"  \"Volume  loss\" represents the MV-related\nbusiness  that DG  would have lost  in competition  with TPMs\neven  if  DG  had been  the  only  service  vendor with  ADEX\ncapability.   \"Excluded  revenue\" represents  the  MV-related\nbusiness that DG did not  have the capacity or the desire  to\nseek,  such as service contracts for  certain systems with at\nleast  one non-DG CPU or service contracts for certain non-DG\nperipheral equipment attached to DG CPUs.\n\n                             -67-\n                              67\n\ntherefore Grumman would not have earned  the remainder of its\n\nMV-related profits.   In  other words, DG's  theory was  that\n\nbecause ADEX  capability was generally  essential to  attract\n\ncustomers with  MV computers,  few such customers  would have\n\nchosen Grumman as a service  vendor, causing Grumman to leave\n\n(or  perhaps never enter) the national  market for service of\n\nMV-related  equipment.    Thus, according  to  DG,  Grumman's\n\nnonduplicative profits were  the indirect result of  consumer\n\nchoices distorted by Grumman's infringement.\n\n          It is unclear whether Grumman contested DG's theory\n\non  the merits,  although Grumman  did introduce  some expert\n\ntestimony  that   owners  of  MV  equipment  were  relatively\n\nindifferent to  the ADEX  issue  in their  choice of  service\n\nvendors.  As  amplified by its arguments  on appeal, however,\n\nGrumman's primary  strategy was to  invite the  jury to  take\n\nGrumman's  infringement as a given,  and focus instead on why\n\nits  customers  were  willing  to pay  for  Grumman  service.\n\nGrumman argued that factors other than its possession and use\n\nof ADEX contributed to its customers' willingness to pay, and\n\nthat it was entitled  to retain a corresponding share  of the\n\nresulting profits.  Grumman  introduced some evidence tending\n\nto show that its  customers attached high value to  the price\n\nand quality of Grumman service,  as well as Grumman's ability\n\nto service non-DG equipment in a mixed-equipment system.\n\n                             -68-\n                              68\n\n          Recognizing that DG's \"but for\" theory focused on a\n\ndifferent   aspect  of   consumer  behavior   than  Grumman's\n\n\"contributing factors\" theory, Grumman argued below that  the\n\ncourt's  instructions should  leave  the jury  free to  adopt\n\neither  line of  reasoning.   Grumman's  suggested method  of\n\ndoing  so  was for  the  court to  instruct the  jury  on the\n\nconcept of apportionment of  infringer's profits set forth in\n\nSection 504(b).    The district  court agreed  that the  jury\n\ncould adopt  the approach  best suited to  the circumstances,\n\nbut refused to give an explicit instruction on apportionment.\n\n          Assuming for the  moment that Grumman  was entitled\n\nto invite the jury  to adopt its analytical framework,  we do\n\nnot   believe  that   the   court's   instruction   \"properly\n\napprise[d]\" the  jury of  the validity  of such  an approach.\n\nJoia v. Jo-Ja Serv. Corp., 817 F.2d 908, 912 (1st Cir. 1987),\n                         \n\ncert. denied, 484  U.S. 1008 (1988).   Although the  district\n            \n\ncourt  instructed  the  jury  to  include  among  infringer's\n\nprofits   only   those    revenues   \"attributable   to   the\n\ninfringement,\"  at  no point  did the  court fully  reveal or\n\nexplain   the  relatively  difficult   statutory  concept  of\n\n\"elements of  profit attributable  to factors other  than the\n\ncopyrighted work.\"   17  U.S.C.    504(b).   As noted  in the\n\npreceding  section, the  court  did refer  (at  least in  its\n\ninstruction  on actual  damages)  to \"diverse  factors\" which\n\nmight have  influenced customers' choice of  Grumman over DG,\n\n                             -69-\n                              69\n\nbut the  court did not  inform the jury  that there  may have\n\nbeen  many  reasons for  customers'  willingness  to pay  for\n\nGrumman service  apart from  the fact that  Grumman possessed\n\nand used ADEX.  Cf. Walker v. Forbes, Inc., No. 93-1273, 1994\n                                          \n\nWL  287173, at *7 (4th Cir.

We may overlook\n\nits failure to do so only if there is no basis in law or fact\n\nfor  the application of Grumman's theory.  See Joia, 817 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 912 (holding that \"all parties are entitled to an adequate\n\njury instruction upon the  controlling issues\"); cf.

For  the reasons set forth below,  we believe\n\nthat  Grumman's  theory  is  firmly  rooted  in  the  law  of\n\ncopyright and the record of this case.\n\n          The  defendant's  burden  under  the  apportionment\n\nprovision of  Section 504(b) is primarily  to demonstrate the\n\nabsence  of a causal link between the infringement and all or\n\n                             -70-\n                              70\n\npart  of the profits claimed  by the plaintiff.

Because  the  rebuttable  presumption  of\n\ncausation represents a  presumption as to  both cause-in-fact\n\nand  proximate  cause,  there   are  two  avenues  of  attack\n\navailable to a copyright defendant.  First, the defendant can\n\nattempt  to  show that  consumers  would  have purchased  its\n\nproduct even without the infringing element.   See, e.g., id.\n                                                             \n\nat  *4  (holding that  district  court  properly allowed  the\n\ndefendant  to show  that  an unauthorized  reproduction of  a\n\nphotograph in an issue of its magazine had no causal relation\n\nto \"amounts  of revenue .  . . committed  to the  issue sight\n\nunseen\").50   Alternatively, the defendant may  show that the\n\nexistence and amount of  its profits are not the  natural and\n\nprobable consequences of the infringement alone, but are also\n\nthe result of  other factors which either add intrinsic value\n\nto the product or have  independent promotional value.

Note, however, that if the plaintiff cannot prove actual\ndamages  and the  defendant shows  that none  of its  gain is\nattributable to  the infringement, the plaintiff  would still\nbe entitled to elect statutory damages.

In the first place, DG  was free to argue\n\nthat  Grumman's  infringement  was   a  \"but  for\"  cause  of\n\nGrumman's nonduplicative  profits, even  if the  court should\n\nhave explained to  the jury that Grumman  could still satisfy\n\nits  burden  by   demonstrating  the  absence  of   proximate\n\ncausation.    In addition,  DG  was  entitled to  argue  that\n\nGrumman's  infringement  should  be  viewed as  the  sole  or\n\noverriding cause of  Grumman's profits.  Cf. Frank Music, 772\n                                                        \n\n                             -73-\n                              73\n\nF.2d at  518 (noting that  \"no one  element was  the sole  or\n\noverriding reason\" for the success of  defendant's infringing\n\n\"Hallelujah Hollywood\" stage show).\n\n          Moreover, although  apportionment primarily depends\n\non  questions  of  causation,  it is  ultimately  a  delicate\n\nexercise informed  by considerations  of fairness  and public\n\npolicy, as well as  fact.  The doctrine of  apportionment was\n\n\"established  upon  equitable  principles\"  in  the analogous\n\ncontext of  patent infringement.

Equitable factors  may also\n     \n\naffect  the substance  of  the apportionment  analysis.   For\n\n                             -74-\n                              74\n\nexample, where the plaintiff  cannot prove actual damages and\n\nthe   defendant's  profits  are  only  from  the  sale  of  a\n\nnoninfringing  product,  the  only  way  to  prevent   unjust\n\nenrichment  may  be  to  place  more  weight  on  the profit-\n\ngenerating effect of an infringing sales tool used to promote\n\nthat   product.     See,   e.g.,  Konor   Enters.  v.   Eagle\n                                                             \n\nPublications,  Inc.,  878  F.2d  138,  140  (4th  Cir.  1989)\n                   \n\n(suggesting that defendant may not be entitled  to retain any\n\nof the profits  from sale  of advertising space  where it  is\n\n\"plausible  . . . that  all profits were  a direct result\" of\n\ninfringing  marketing  information  distributed to  potential\n\nadvertisers).\n\n          Similarly,  the  policies underlying  the Copyright\n\nAct may play some role in  the apportionment of profits.  For\n\nexample, Sheldon and  its progeny suggest that  apportionment\n                \n\nis  almost  always available  in  the  context of  infringing\n\nderivative works, perhaps in part because original expression\n\nadded  by  the  infringer  is itself  entitled  to  copyright\n\nprotection.   Furthermore, where the plaintiff  is seeking to\n\nvindicate its right  to exclude others rather than  its right\n\nto collect a licensing fee, see 17 U.S.C.   106 (1988 &amp; Supp.\n                               \n\nIV 1992) (describing  rights of copyright  owner), it may  be\n\nmore appropriate to view  the infringement as an \"overriding\"\n\ncause  of  the  defendant's  profits. In  such  cases,  rigid\n\nisolation  of the value of  the infringement to the defendant\n\n                             -75-\n                              75\n\n(which would approximate a \"reasonable\"  licensing fee) would\n\neffectively condone  a license the plaintiff  never wished to\n\ngrant.  Lastly, we note that an unjust enrichment theory aims\n\nto  strip the defendant of its ill-gotten gains, see, e.g., 3\n                                                          \n\nNimmer    14.01[A],  at 14-6,  encourage compliance  with the\n      \n\nCopyright  Act, see,  e.g.,  Walker, 1994  WL  287173, at  *2\n                                   \n\n(noting  that  an award  of  infringer's  profits \"makes  the\n\ninfringer  realize that it is cheaper to buy than to steal\"),\n\nand perhaps  \"compensate\" a plaintiff unable  to prove actual\n\ndamages, see Sheldon, 309 U.S. at 399 (describing the goal of\n                    \n\nan award of infringer's profits as \"just compensation for the\n\nwrong\").  Therefore, apportionment of infringer's profits may\n\nbe  particularly  appropriate  where a  concurrent  award  of\n\nactual damages significantly serves all three purposes.51\n\n          In  light of  the  discussion above,  we hold  that\n\nGrumman was  entitled to  an instruction on  apportionment in\n\norder  to allow  the jury  to determine  whether and  to what\n\n                    \n\n51.  Our discussion of equitable and policy considerations is\nintended  to  aid courts  in  apportioning  profits when  the\nparties submit the issue of infringer's profits to the court,\nsee  Sid  &amp;  Marty  Krofft Television  Productions,  Inc.  v.\n                                                         \nMcDonald's Corp., 562 F.2d 1157, 1175 (9th Cir. 1977) (noting\n                \nthat  parties  may  stipulate  to  bench  trial on  issue  of\ninfringer's   profits),  and   to   provide   some   rational\nexplanation  for the  discordant aspects  of the case  law on\napportionment.   While  a court  may instruct  the jury  that\ndamages should be \"reasonable\" (as the court in this case did\nwithout objection from either  party), we do not hold  that a\ncourt  may ask the jury itself to weigh matters of equity and\npublic policy.\n\n                             -76-\n                              76\n\nextent   apportionment  of  its  nonduplicative  profits  was\n\nreasonable under the circumstances of this case.\n\n          Whether  a  remand  is  necessary  is  a  different\n\nquestion,  but  one   readily  resolved.     Grumman  clearly\n\nintroduced evidence that would have  permitted a jury to find\n\nthat  Grumman's customers  were  willing to  pay for  Grumman\n\nservice for reasons  beyond its possession  and use of  ADEX.\n\nIndeed, we believe  that Grumman's  evidence is  sufficiently\n\ncompelling that Grumman is  entitled to some apportionment as\n\na  matter of  law.    Because  the  absence  of  an  explicit\n\ninstruction  on apportionment \"may have unfairly affected the\n\njury's conclusions,\"  Allen, 873 F.2d  at 470, we  remand the\n                           \n\ncase to  the district court for an  appropriate resolution of\n\ntheissue ofapportionment ofGrumman's nonduplicativeprofits.52\n\n                    \n\n52.  In  order  to  avoid  undue  confusion  and  unnecessary\nproceedings, we add the  following procedural notes to assist\nthe district court in resolving the issue of apportionment of\nGrumman's nonduplicative profits.\n     Cognizant of our authority  to take whatever action \"may\nbe  just  under  the circumstances,\"  28  U.S.C.     2106, we\nbelieve that remittitur would  provide the most equitable and\nefficient means of remedying  the error.  The  factual record\nwas  highly developed  at  trial on  the  issue of  Grumman's\nprofits, leaving a trail adequate to allow the district court\nto approximate the effect of the erroneous instruction on the\njury's  verdict.   See 6A  James Wm.  Moore, et  al., Moore's\n                                                             \nFederal  Practice     59.08[7],   at  59-207  (2d  ed.  1994)\n                 \n(explaining that if \"the effect of [an erroneous instruction]\ncan be reasonably approximated  to a definite portion of  the\namount of the verdict, the  appellate court may condition its\naffirmance  on the  plaintiff  remitting that  amount of  the\nverdict which  is apparently traceable to  the error below\").\nMoreover,  Grumman  requested  remittitur  as  an alternative\nremedy in its Rule 59 motion.\n\n                             -77-\n                              77\n\n          6.  Attorney's Fees\n                             \n\n          Because it appears that an award of attorney's fees\n\nhas not been quantified, see Grumman VII, 825 F. Supp. at 370\n                                        \n\n(ordering DG  to  resubmit  its  application  for  attorney's\n\nfees), the merits of such an award are not before this court.\n\nNonetheless,  Grumman mounts  a procedural  attack that  does\n\nappear  to be ripe  for review.   Grumman claims that  (1) DG\n\n\"elected\"  the state  trade  secrets remedy  over any  remedy\n\navailable under  the Copyright Act, and  (2) since attorney's\n\nfees  are  only available  under the  Copyright Act,  and not\n\n                    \n\n     We  are aware  that the  jury  did not  separately award\nactual  damages and  infringer's profits.   Nevertheless, the\nverdict is relatively close to the amount DG requested and it\nis  extremely unlikely that  the jury  would not  have relied\nprimarily  on  one  or  the  other  of  the  competing expert\ntheories.  DG requested $28,003,000 in damages, consisting of\n$26,364,000 in lost profits and $1,639,000 in  nonduplicative\nprofits.    The jury  awarded DG  a  total of  $27,417,000 in\ndamages -- $586,000  less than  the requested amount.   As  a\nresult,  DG appears  to have  won  infringer's profits  of at\nleast  $1,053,000  ($27,417,000  - $26,364,000)  and  at most\n$1,639,000.    While  we   do  not  mandate  this  particular\nanalysis, we are confident that the district  court, with its\nsuperior understanding of the voluminous record, will be able\nto estimate either the relevant figures or, if necessary, the\n\"maximum effect\" of the error on the jury's verdict.  See id.\n                                                             \n  59.09[7], at 59-207 to 59-208 (\"Even when the effect of the\nerror cannot  be  allocated  to  a distinct  portion  of  the\nverdict, remittitur may  still be used if the  maximum effect\nof the error can be established.\").\n     If  DG were to refuse remittitur  in favor of a new jury\ntrial   on   the   issue  of   apportionment   of   Grumman's\nnonduplicative   profits,  we  hope  that  the  parties  will\nnegotiate in good faith to settle the remanded portion of the\ncase or at least agree to a more expeditious procedure.  See,\n                                                            \ne.g., Sid &amp; Marty Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1175 (noting that right\n                        \nto  jury   trial  extends   to  adjudication  of   claim  for\ninfringer's profits  but that parties may  stipulate to bench\ntrial).\n\n                             -78-\n                              78\n\nstate trade secrets law, DG is not entitled to any attorney's\n\nfees.   Grumman is wrong in both respects.  DG did not simply\n\nelect  state law  remedies.   DG  proposed  a judgment  form,\n\nwholly adopted  by the district court, that  included (1) the\n\ncompensatory  damages awarded  by the  jury,53 (2)  state law\n\nstatutory damages,  (3) state  law prejudgment  interest, and\n\n(4)  federal law  attorney's fees.   Nor  was DG  required to\n\nforsake nonduplicative elements  of the  various federal  and\n\nstate  law remedies.   See Foley v. City  of Lowell, 948 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n10,  17  (1st Cir.  1991) (suggesting  that,  as long  as the\n\ndamages are \"segregated  into federal and  state components,\"\n\nplaintiff need not  choose one  body of law  under which  all\n\ndamages  will be paid); cf.

With  respect to  the\n\npositive  tie, Grumman alleges that  DG will not provide ADEX\n\nservice (i.e., use  of ADEX  by a DG  service technician)  to\n       \n\nequipment  owners  unless  they  also  purchase   DG  support\n\nservices.  With respect to the  negative tie, Grumman alleges\n\nthat  DG will not  license ADEX software  to equipment owners\n                                        \n\nunless they  agree not  to purchase  support services  from a\n\nTPM.\n\n          Grumman  has  not  introduced  evidence  that  ADEX\n\nservice  is  a  product  separate from  other  components  of\n\nservice.    There  is  no  evidence  that  any  customer  has\n\npurchased, or would wish to purchase, ADEX service separately\n\nfrom the purchase  of other  components of service.   Nor  is\n\nthere evidence that it  would be efficient for any  entity to\n\nprovide  ADEX service  separately  from  other components  of\n\nservice.55  \n\n                    \n\n55.  The  Fourth Circuit  came to a  similar conclusion  on a\nnearly identical record when it rejected STI's tying claim:\n\n          If   \"access   to\"  MV/ADEX   and  repair\n          services   are   considered  to   be  the\n          products  in  question,  appellants  have\n          clearly  failed   to  produce  sufficient\n\n                             -83-\n                              83\n\n          In contrast, the record does  contain evidence that\n\nADEX software  is a  product separate from  support services.\n\nIt  is undisputed that CMO  customers wish to  license -- and\n\nhave licensed  -- ADEX  software  without purchasing  support\n\nservices from  DG or a TPM.  There is also evidence that some\n\nof Grumman's customers would  consider licensing ADEX from DG\n\nso that Grumman could continue to service their MV computers.\n\nIn  addition, the  summary  judgment record  would support  a\n\nfinding that for many years DG provided diagnostics and other\n\nservice \"tools\" to computer purchasers as  part of a computer\n\nequipment package,  regardless  whether the  owner  performed\n\nself-maintenance  or  hired  DG  or a  TPM  to  maintain  the\n\ncomputers.  In fact, there is evidence that through the early\n\n1980s, DG  provided service  \"tools\" --  including diagnostic\n\nsoftware other than ADEX -- directly to TPMs.  Finally, there\n\nis some  evidence  that other  computer  manufacturers  (IBM,\n\nDigital  Equipment Corporation,  and  Wang) have  licensed or\n\nsold diagnostics to those other than their service customers.\n\n                    \n\n          evidence  that the  products are  in fact\n          separate.    On  the  record  before  us,\n          demand  for mere \"access  to\" MV/ADEX, in\n          contrast  to demand  for licenses  to use\n          MV/ADEX, is indistinguishable from demand\n          for  repair  services.   Appellants  have\n          introduced  no  evidence  that there  are\n          customers  who  would  purchase  MV/ADEX-\n          assisted  diagnostic services  separately\n          from all other  repair services for  Data\n          General equipment.\n\nSTI, 963 F.2d at 685 n.9.\n   \n\n                             -84-\n                              84\n\nViewed  in  a light  most  favorable to  Grumman,  the record\n\nreveals a  genuine dispute  as to whether  ADEX software  and\n\nsupport services  for DG computers are  distinct products for\n\nthe  purposes of  a tying analysis.56   Consequently,  we may\n\nproceed  to   determine   whether  Grumman   has   introduced\n\nsufficient  proof that  DG has  conditioned the  licensing of\n\nADEX  to  CMOs on  the agreement  of  these customers  not to\n\npurchase service from TPMs.\n\n               b.  Tying Arrangement\n                                    \n\n          Proof  of  a tying  arrangement  generally requires\n\nevidence that  the supplier's  sale of the  tying product  is\n\nconditioned upon  the unwilling purchase of  the tied product\n\nfrom the supplier or an unwilling promise not to purchase the\n\ntied product from  any other supplier.   See, e.g., Jefferson\n                                                             \n\nParish, 466 U.S. at 12 (\"[T]he essential characteristic of an\n      \n\ninvalid  tying arrangement lies  in the seller's exploitation\n\nof its control over the tying product to force the buyer into\n\nthe purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did  not\n\nwant at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on\n\ndifferent  terms.\");  Wells  Real  Estate, 850  F.2d  at  814\n                                         \n\n(\"Tying  arrangements involve  the use  of leverage  over the\n\nmarket for one product . . . to coerce purchases  of a second\n\nproduct  . .  . .\").

In essence,  whether the  conditioning is\n\nexplicit  or  implicit,  we   will  not  consider  the  anti-\n\ncompetitive effects of a tie to be unreasonable per se unless\n                                                      \n\nthere  is evidence that the supplier of the tying product has\n\nactually used its market power to impose the condition.\n\n          Grumman points to  only one alleged negative  tying\n\narrangement,  asserting  that  DG's  Cooperative  Maintenance\n\nAgreement  (\"CMO  Agreement\")   contains  an  explicit  tying\n\ncondition.  The  CMO Agreement indeed states that DG designed\n\n                             -86-\n                              86\n\nthe  CMO  program  for   \"customers  who  perform  their  own\n\nmaintenance\" and that one qualifying criterion for CMO status\n\nis  that  the  customer  \"[m]aintain[]  systems  which   were\n\npurchased either for  itself or for  resale to its  customers\n\n[as an official  DG distributor].\"  And,  although the record\n\nsuggests  that  CMOs  may  still  purchase  DG  service  (and\n\npresumably TPM  service) on  a \"time and  materials\" basis,57\n\nCMOs  do not  enter  contracts with  either  DG or  TPMs  for\n\nongoing  support services.   DG  and Grumman both  agree that\n\nCMOs  cannot allow TPMs to  use copies of  ADEX licensed by a\n\nCMO.\n\n          Grumman's allegation of an illegal tie cannot go to\n\na  jury  on  a  record so  sparse.    Before  turning to  the\n\nprincipal flaw  in Grumman's case,  we note that  these facts\n\nlend only  modest support to  the accusation  that CMOs  have\n\nactually promised not to purchase support services from TPMs.\n\nThe  CMO Agreement  does  require that  participants maintain\n\ntheir own  computers, but  nowhere does the  agreement define\n\nself-maintenance  status   in  detail  or  elaborate  on  the\n\nconsequences to a CMO if it enters a  service contract with a\n\n                    \n\n57.  Frederick Raley,  Jr., a  DG official, testified  at his\ndeposition  that \"self-maintaining\" CMO customers would still\nbe able to use  DG service, except that  \"they wouldn't be  a\ncontract  customer,  they  would  be  a  time  and  materials\ncustomer.\"   This portion of Raley's  deposition was actually\nplaced in the  record by Grumman as part of  an exhibit to an\n                                \naffidavit  supporting Grumman's  opposition  to one  of  DG's\nmotions for summary judgment.\n\n                             -87-\n                              87\n\nTPM.   In fact, as we  have noted, there is  some evidence in\n\nthe  record that CMOs  are free to  purchase support services\n\nfrom others without adverse consequences, at least on a \"time\n\nand materials\" basis.\n\n          More  importantly, there  is virtually  no evidence\n\nthat  any CMO  has  unwillingly chosen  to  maintain its  own\n                               \n\ncomputers.  Although there is some evidence that DG officials\n\ndesigned  the CMO  program  in part  to  prevent loss  of  DG\n\nrevenue to TPMs, there  is no evidence that consumers  became\n\nCMO customers for any reason other than their belief that the\n\nCMO program was a \"product\" superior to TPM service.  Indeed,\n\nwhile Grumman has argued tirelessly that DG service customers\n                                                   \n\nare  forced  to  swallow   overpriced  and  inferior  support\n\nservice, Grumman  has offered no evidence  that CMO customers\n                                                   \n\nare similarly disadvantaged.  There is not a single affidavit\n\nin the  record  in  which a  CMO  customer  expresses  either\n\ndispleasure with the CMO program or an  unfulfilled desire to\n\nswitch to a  TPM.58  Nor is there any  other type of evidence\n\nthat  DG equipment  owners capable  of maintaining  their own\n\nequipment  would be more  satisfied as TPM  customers than as\n\nCMO  customers.   Consequently,  the evidence  in the  record\n\n                    \n\n58.  Likewise, there is no evidence in the record that former\nTPM customers have reluctantly terminated  their relationship\nwith Grumman in  order to  participate in the  CMO program.  \nCf. Kodak, 112 S.  Ct. at 2081 (noting that  record contained\n         \nevidence that \"consumers have  switched to Kodak service even\nthough they preferred [TPM] service\").\n\n                             -88-\n                              88\n\nwould  not allow  a  reasonable jury  to  find that  the  CMO\n\nprogram is \"an inferior or overpriced product,\" Amerinet, 972\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 1501, protected from competition by DG's exploitation\n\nof its control over ADEX.\n\n          In  conclusion, Grumman's allegation  of a positive\n\ntie between ADEX service and DG support services fails in the\n\nabsence  of proof that these  services are truly two distinct\n\nproducts.   Grumman's  allegation of  a negative  tie between\n\nADEX software and non-purchase  of TPM support services fails\n\nin the absence of  proof that DG coerced consumers  to accept\n\nsuch an arrangement.  Accordingly, the district court did not\n\nerr in granting DG's motion for summary judgment on Grumman's\n\ntying counterclaim.\n\n          2.  Monopolization\n                            \n\n          In  addition to  alleging  unlawful tying,  Grumman\n\naccused  DG  of willfully  maintaining  its  monopoly in  the\n\naftermarket  for  service of  DG  computers  in violation  of\n\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.   2, which  prohibits\n\nthe  monopolization  of \"any  part of  the trade  or commerce\n\namong  the several States.\"   To survive  summary judgment on\n\nits  willful maintenance  claim, Grumman  must demonstrate  a\n\ngenuine dispute about the existence of two elements: (1) DG's\n\npossession  of monopoly  power  in the  market59 for  support\n\n                    \n\n59.  DG does not seriously  dispute Grumman's contention that\nthe  aftermarket for  service of  DG computers  comprises the\n\"relevant  market\"  for   purposes  of  antitrust   analysis.\n\n                             -89-\n                              89\n\nservices of DG  computers; and (2)  DG's maintenance of  that\n\npower  through \"exclusionary  conduct.\"   Town of  Concord v.\n                                                          \n\nBoston Edison Co., 915  F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.  1990) (Breyer,\n                 \n\nC.J.)

See,  e.g., United States  v.

We hold\n\nbelow that the  desire of an author to  be the exclusive user\n\nof its  original work is a  presumptively legitimate business\n\njustification   for  the  author's   refusal  to  license  to\n\ncompetitors.  We hold further that  Grumman has not presented\n\nsufficient proof to rebut  this presumption and thereby avert\n\nsummary  judgment.    In  particular, we  find  no  merit  in\n\nGrumman's contention that DG acted in an exclusionary fashion\n\nin discontinuing its liberal  policies allowing TPM access to\n\ndiagnostic software.  Finally, we conclude that no reasonable\n\njury could find that DG's restrictions on TPM access to other\n\nservice tools amount to exclusionary conduct.\n\n               a.  Unilateral Refusals to Deal\n                                              \n\n          Because  a  monopolization claim  does  not require\n\nproof of concerted activity, even the unilateral actions of a\n\nmonopolist  can  constitute  exclusionary conduct.    See  15\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\n61.  Grumman also  seeks to portray the  alleged positive and\nnegative tying arrangements as exclusionary conduct violative\nof Section  2.  We do  not consider this argument  because of\nour  determination in  the  previous section  that DG's  ADEX\npolicies  cannot   properly  be  described   as  arrangements\nconditioning  the sale of one product on the purchase or non-\npurchase of another.\n\n                             -92-\n                              92\n\nU.S.C.   2 (referring to \"[e]very person who shall monopolize\n\n. . . or combine or  conspire with any other person . .  . to\n        \n\nmonopolize\") (emphasis  added); Moore  v.

Thus, a\n\nmonopolist's unilateral refusal to  deal with its competitors\n\n(as long as  the refusal harms  the competitive process)  may\n\nconstitute prima facie  evidence of  exclusionary conduct  in\n\nthe context  of a Section 2 claim.

In  essence, a\n      \n\nunilateral  refusal to  deal is  prima facie  exclusionary if\n\nthere is evidence of harm to the competitive process; a valid\n                         \n\nbusiness  justification  requires  proof   of  countervailing\n\nbenefits to the competitive process. \n        \n\n          Despite  the  theoretical  possibility, there  have\n\nbeen relatively  few cases in  which a unilateral  refusal to\n\ndeal  has formed the basis  of a successful  Section 2 claim.\n\nSeveral  of the cases commonly  cited for a  supposed duty to\n\ndeal  were actually  cases  of joint  conduct  in which  some\n\ncompetitors joined to frustrate others.

The case not only involved a capital-intensive\n\npublic  utility facility  -- which  could not  effectively be\n\nduplicated and occupied a distinct separate market -- but the\n\nSupreme  Court  laid  considerable  emphasis  on  \"supported\"\n\nfindings in the district court \"that Otter Tail's refusals to\n\nsell  at  wholesale  or  to  wheel  were  solely  to  prevent\n\nmunicipal  power  systems   from  eroding  its   monopolistic\n\nposition.\"  410 U.S. at 378.\n\n          In   Aspen   Skiing,   the   Court   criticized   a\n                             \n\nmonopolist's unilateral  refusal to deal in  a very different\n\nsituation, casting serious doubt  on the proposition that the\n\nCourt has adopted any single  rule or formula for determining\n\nwhen a unilateral refusal to deal is unlawful.  In that case,\n\nan \"all-Aspen\" ski ticket -- valid at any mountain in Aspen -\n\n-  had been  developed  and jointly  marketed when  the three\n\n(later four)  ski areas  in Aspen  were owned by  independent\n\nentities.  472  U.S. at 589.   Some  time after Aspen  Skiing\n\nCompany  (\"Ski Co.\") came into  control of three  of the four\n\nski areas, Ski Co. refused to continue a joint agreement with\n\nAspen Highlands Skiing Corp.  (\"Highlands\"), the owner of the\n\nfourth  area.    Id.  at  592-93.    Although  there  was  no\n                    \n\n\"essential facility\"  involved, the  Court found that  it was\n\nexclusionary  for Ski  Co.,  as a  monopolist,  to refuse  to\n\ncontinue a presumably efficient \"pattern of distribution that\n\n                             -95-\n                              95\n\nhad originated in a competitive market  and had persisted for\n\nseveral years.\"  Id. at 603.\n                    \n\n          It is not entirely clear whether the Court in Aspen\n                                                             \n\nSkiing merely  intended to  create a category  of refusal-to-\n      \n\ndeal cases different from  the essential facilities  category\n\nor whether  the Court was  inviting the  application of  more\n\ngeneral   principles  of  antitrust  analysis  to  unilateral\n\nrefusals  to deal.  We  follow the parties'  lead in assuming\n\nthat Grumman  need not tailor  its argument to  a preexisting\n\n\"category\" of unilateral refusals to deal.\n\n               b.  Unilateral Refusals to License\n                                                 \n\n          DG attempts to  undermine Grumman's  monopolization\n\nclaim  by proposing  a powerful  irrebuttable presumption:  a\n\nunilateral  refusal   to  license   a  copyright   can  never\n\nconstitute exclusionary conduct.  We agree that some  type of\n\npresumption is in order, but reach that conclusion only after\n\nan exhaustive  inquiry touching  on the general  character of\n\npresumptions, the  role of  market analysis in  the copyright\n\ncontext,  existing  responses  to  the  tension  between  the\n\nantitrust  and patent laws, the nature of the rights extended\n\nby  the  copyright  laws,  and  our  duty  to  harmonize  two\n\nconflicting statutes.\n\n               (1)  The Propriety of a Presumption\n                                                  \n\n          We  begin  our   analysis  with  two  observations.\n\nFirst, DG's rule of  law could be characterized as  either an\n\n                             -96-\n                              96\n\nempirical assumption or a policy preference.  For example, if\n\nwe were convinced that refusals to license a copyright always\n\nhave a  net positive  effect on  the competitive  process, we\n\nmight adopt a presumption to this effect in order to preclude\n\nwasteful litigation about a  known fact.  On the  other hand,\n\nif we  were  convinced  that  the rights  enumerated  in  the\n\nCopyright    Act    should   take    precedence    over   the\n\nresponsibilities set forth in  the Sherman Act, regardless of\n\nthe realities of the market, we might adopt a blanket rule of\n\npreference.     DG's  argument  contains   elements  of  both\n\narchetypal categories of presumptions.  \n\n          Second,  we  note   that  the  phrase  \"competitive\n\nprocess\" may need some refinement in order to evaluate either\n\nan empirical  assumption or  a policy  presumption concerning\n\nthe  desirability  of   unilateral  refusals  to  license   a\n\ncopyright.    Antitrust law  generally  seeks  to punish  and\n\nprevent harm to consumers in particular markets, with a focus\n\non relatively  specific time  periods.  See,  e.g., Jefferson\n                                                             \n\nParish,  466 U.S. at 18  (holding that \"any  inquiry into the\n      \n\nvalidity of a tying  arrangement must focus on the  market or\n\nmarkets in which the two products are sold, for that is where\n\nthe  anticompetitive  forcing has  its  impact\").   Thus,  in\n\ndetermining whether conduct is exclusionary in the context of\n\na monopolization  claim, we ordinarily  focus on harm  to the\n\ncompetitive process  in the relevant market  and time period.\n\n                             -97-\n                              97\n\nSee generally 3 Areeda &amp; Turner    517-28, at 346-88,    533-\n                               \n\n36,  at 406-431.   Confining the competitive  process in this\n\nway  assists courts  in  deciding particular  disputes  based\n\nprimarily  on  case-specific adjudicative  facts  rather than\n\ngenerally-applicable \"legislative\" facts or assumptions.  The\n\nuse   and  protection   of   copyrights   also  affects   the\n\n\"competitive process,\" but it may not be appropriate to judge\n\nthe effect of the use  of a copyright by looking only  at one\n\nmarket or one time period.\n\n          We  now consider  what appears  to be  an empirical\n\nproclamation  from   DG:    \"[T]he  refusal   to  make  one's\n\ninnovation  available  to rivals  .  .  . is  pro-competitive\n\nconduct.\"62    As support,  DG  cites Grinnell,  384  U.S. at\n                                              \n\n570-71, in which  the Court held that  willful maintenance of\n\nmonopoly  does  not  include  \"growth  or  development  as  a\n\nconsequence   of  a  superior  product.\"     It  is  not  the\n\nsuperiority of  a  work that  allows  the author  to  exclude\n\nothers, however,  but rather the limited  monopoly granted by\n\ncopyright law.   Moreover, one reason  why the Copyright  Act\n\nfosters  investment and innovation  is that it  may allow the\n\nauthor to earn monopoly profits by licensing the copyright to\n\nothers or reserving the  copyright for the author's exclusive\n\n                    \n\n62.  Elsewhere in its brief, DG adds  that DG's \"refus[al] to\nallow Grumman to  use MV/ADEX is  . . .  the precise  conduct\nthat  the  antitrust  and  copyright  laws  are  designed  to\nencourage.\"\n\n                             -98-\n                              98\n\nuse.

Thus, at least in a particular market and\n\nfor a particular period of time, the Copyright  Act tolerates\n\nbehavior  that may harm both  consumers and competitors.

Instead, DG suggests  that allowing copyright\n\nowners  to exclude others from the use of their works creates\n\nincentives which ultimately work  to the benefit of consumers\n\nin the DG service  aftermarket as well  as to the benefit  of\n\nconsumers generally.  In other words, DG seeks to justify any\n\nimmediate  harm to  consumers by  pointing to  countervailing\n\nlong-term  benefits.   Certainly, a  monopolist's refusal  to\n\nlicense others to use a commercially successful patented idea\n                                                             \n\nis likely to have more profound anti-competitive consequences\n\nthan  a refusal to allow others  to duplicate the copyrighted\n\nexpression of an  unpatented idea (although  such differences\n          \n\n                             -99-\n                              99\n\nmay  become  less   pronounced  if   copyright  law   becomes\n\nincreasingly  protective  of  intellectual  property  such as\n\ncomputer  software).   But  by  no  means is  a  monopolist's\n\nrefusal  to  license a  copyright  entirely \"pro-competitive\"\n\nwithin the  ordinary economic  framework of the  Sherman Act.\n\nAccordingly, it  may be  inappropriate to adopt  an empirical\n\nassumption  that  simply  ignores  harm  to  the  competitive\n\nprocess  caused  by  a  monopolist's  unilateral  refusal  to\n\nlicense a copyright.  Even if it is  clear that exclusive use\n\nof a  copyright can have  anti-competitive consequences, some\n\ntype  of presumption  may  nevertheless be  appropriate as  a\n\nmatter of either antitrust law or copyright law.\n\n               (2)  Antitrust Law and the Accommodation of   \n                                                          \n                    Patent Rights\n                                 \n\n          Antitrust  law is  somewhat instructive.

See, e.g., Miller  Insituform, 830 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat  609  (declaring summarily  that  \"[t]here  is no  adverse\n                                                 \n\neffect  on competition  since, as  a patent  monopolist, [the\n                             \n\npatent holder] had [the] exclusive right to manufacture, use,\n\nand sell  his invention.\")  (emphasis  added).

We may  also venture  to infer  that, in\n\npassing the Copyright Act,  Congress itself made an empirical\n\nassumption that allowing copyright holders to collect license\n\nfees  and exclude  others from  using  their works  creates a\n\nsystem of  incentives that  promotes consumer welfare  in the\n\nlong  term  by  encouraging  investment in  the  creation  of\n\ndesirable artistic  and functional works of  expression.

We cannot require antitrust defendants to prove and\n\nreprove the  merits of  this legislative assumption  in every\n\ncase  where a  refusal to  license a  copyrighted work  comes\n\nunder  attack.

Congress  amended the patent laws in  1988 to\n\nprovide that \"[n]o patent  owner otherwise entitled to relief\n\n                            -105-\n                             105\n\nfor infringement . . . of a patent shall be  denied relief or\n\ndeemed  guilty of misuse  or illegal extension  of the patent\n\nright by reason of [the  patent owner's] refus[al] to license\n\nor use any rights to the patent.\"  35 U.S.C.   271(d) (1988).\n\nSection  271(d) clearly  prevents an  infringer from  using a\n\npatent misuse defense when  the patent owner has unilaterally\n\nrefused a license, and may even herald the prohibition of all\n\nantitrust claims  and counterclaims premised on  a refusal to\n\nlicense  a patent.    See Richard  Calkins,  Patent Law:  The\n                                                             \n\nImpact  of  the  1988 Patent  Misuse  Reform  Act and  Noerr-\n                                                             \n\nPennington   Doctrine  on   Misuse  Defenses   and  Antitrust\n                                                             \n\nCounterclaims,   38   Drake   L.

Alaska, 451 U.S. 259,\n                                              \n\n267 (1981), we  must harmonize the two  as best we  can, id.,\n                                                            \n\nmindful of the legislative and judicial approaches to similar\n\nconflicts created by the patent laws.  We must not lose sight\n\nof the need to preserve the economic incentives fueled by the\n\nCopyright Act, but neither may  we ignore the tension between\n\n                            -106-\n                             106\n\nthe two very different policies embodied in the Copyright Act\n\nand  the Sherman Act, both designed ultimately to improve the\n\nwelfare of consumers in  our free market system.   Drawing on\n\nour discussion above, we hold that while exclusionary conduct\n\ncan include  a monopolist's  unilateral refusal to  license a\n\ncopyright,  an author's desire to exclude  others from use of\n\nits  copyrighted  work  is  a  presumptively  valid  business\n\njustification for any immediate harm to consumers.64  \n\n               c.  DG's Refusal to License ADEX to non-CMOs \n                                                           \n\n          Having arrived at  the applicable legal  standards,\n\nwe may resolve Grumman's principal allegation of exclusionary\n\nconduct.   Although there  may be  a genuine  factual dispute\n\nabout  the effect on DG  equipment owners of  DG's refusal to\n\nlicense  ADEX to  TPMs, DG's  desire to  exercise its  rights\n\nunder  the Copyright  Act is  a presumptively  valid business\n\njustification. \n\n          Apparently   sensing  the  uphill   nature  of  its\n\nallegation of  an exclusionary  refusal  to license,  Grumman\n\nseeks to overcome any  obstacles primarily by  characterizing\n\nDG's  licensing  policies  as  a   monopolist's  exclusionary\n\nwithdrawal  of  assistance  within  the  framework  of  Aspen\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n64.  Wary of  undermining the Sherman Act, however, we do not\nhold  that  an  antitrust  plaintiff  can  never  rebut  this\npresumption, for there  may be rare  cases in which  imposing\nantitrust liability  is unlikely to frustrate  the objectives\nof the Copyright Act.\n\n                            -107-\n                             107\n\nSkiing.   Citing  Aspen  Skiing, Grumman  contends that  DG's\n                               \n\nrefusal to license ADEX to TPMs, in light of the fact that DG\n\npreviously   allowed  TPMs   to   use  DG   diagnostics,   is\n\nexclusionary  conduct because \"[a] monopolist that has helped\n\na  market  develop  may  not  withdraw  its  support  without\n\nlegitimate business justifications.\"\n\n          Assuming  that  such  a   claim  can  overcome  the\n\npresumption that a refusal to license is not exclusionary, we\n\nnevertheless hold that Aspen Skiing cannot apply to the facts\n                                   \n\nof this case.  The reasoning of Aspen Skiing has little to do\n                                            \n\nwith the fact that defendant Ski Co. withdrew assistance upon\n\nwhich competitors  may have relied when  entering the market.\n\nRather, the decision turns on a comparison of the behavior of\n\nfirms in a competitive  market (the Aspen ski market)  with a\n\nmonopolist's  behavior once  competition has  been curtailed.\n\nThe  Court  noted that  the  rich  soil  of  competition  had\n\nproduced  the   all-mountain  ticket  in   Aspen  and   other\n\nmultimountain  areas, justifying  an  \"infer[ence] that  such\n\ntickets satisfy consumer demand in free competitive markets.\"\n\n472 U.S.  at 603.

Finally, after\n                        \n\ncanvassing evidence of consumer preferences concerning skiing\n\noptions  at Aspen,  the Court  concluded that  Ski Co.'s  new\n\npolicies did in  fact harm consumers.

Cf.

The\n\nanalytical framework of Aspen Skiing cannot function in these\n                                    \n\ncircumstances, however,  because we  are unable to  view DG's\n\nmarket  practices  in  both  competitive  and  noncompetitive\n\nconditions.  While TPMs  have made inroads in the  market for\n\nservice of DG computers,  DG has always been a  monopolist in\n\nthat market, and competitive conditions have never prevailed.\n\n                            -109-\n                             109\n\nTherefore, it would not  be \"appropriate to infer\"  from DG's\n\nchange of  heart that  its former policies  \"satisfy consumer\n\ndemand in free competitive markets.\"   Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 603.\n\n          Nor does  it appear that  Grumman would be  able at\n\ntrial to overcome the presumption on any other theory.  There\n\nis  no evidence that DG  acquired its ADEX  copyrights in any\n\nunlawful  manner;  indeed,   the  record  suggests  that   DG\n\ndeveloped all its software internally.  Cf. 3 Areeda &amp; Turner\n                                                             \n\n   706,  at  127-28  (arguing  that  although  an  internally\n\ndeveloped  patent may be as exclusionary as one acquired from\n\noutside a  firm, labelling  the former as  exclusionary would\n\n\"discourage  progressiveness  by monopolists\").    And, while\n\nthere is evidence that DG knew that developing a \"proprietary\n\nposition\" in  the area of  diagnostic software would  help to\n\nmaintain its monopoly  in the aftermarket  for service of  DG\n\ncomputers, there is also evidence that DG set out to create a\n\nstate-of-the-art  diagnostic that  would help to  improve the\n\nquality of DG service.   Cf. id.   706, at 128-29 (suggesting\n                                \n\nthat  \"nearly all commercial  research rests on  a mixture of\n\nmotivations\" and that a search for an overriding \"antisocial\"\n\nmotivation  would  be unilluminating).    In  fact, there  is\n\nclearly some evidence  that ADEX is a  significant benefit to\n\nowners of DG's MV computers.   ADEX is a better  product than\n\nany  other  diagnostic for  MV computers.    The use  of ADEX\n\n                            -110-\n                             110\n\nappears to have increased the efficiency and reduced the cost\n\nof  service  because  technicians  can  locate problems  more\n\nquickly  and,  through  the  use of  the  software's  \"remote\n\nassistance\" capability, can  arrive at customer  sites having\n\ndetermined  ahead   of  time   what  replacement  parts   are\n\nnecessary.   In addition to  the possibility of  lower prices\n\noccasioned by such gains in efficiency, ADEX also promises to\n\nlower prices  through gains  in effectiveness.   For example,\n\ncustomers may  save the cost of  replacing expensive hardware\n\ncomponents because the use of advanced diagnostics  increases\n\nthe  possibility that  technicians can  locate a  problem and\n\nrepair the component.\n\n          d.  DG's Other Restrictive Policies\n                                             \n\n          Grumman's other allegations of exclusionary conduct\n\nare equally devoid of merit and require no extended analysis.\n\nIt  is essentially undisputed that  DG will not provide spare\n\nparts,  depot repair services,  certain documentation, change\n\norder kits, or schematics to TPMs.  But there is no  evidence\n\nof any resulting harm  to DG equipment owners.  DG makes most\n\nof  these  items  available  directly  to  equipment  owners.\n\nEquipment owners \"may  purchase . . .  depot repair services,\n\nrev-ups [change  order kits],  and spare parts  directly from\n\nDG, regardless of whether their computers are serviced by DG,\n\nTPMs, or themselves.\"   Grumman II, 761 F. Supp.  at 189.  We\n                                  \n\ncannot presume that elimination  of an intermediate seller of\n\n                            -111-\n                             111\n\nsuch items  harms consumers; indeed, consumers  are likely to\n\nbenefit by not having  to accept TPMs' mark-up of  DG prices.\n\nFurther,  a direct sales policy does not act as a significant\n\nbarrier to market entry  by competitors offering lower prices\n\nfor  higher quality  support services.   TPM  technicians may\n\nidentify broken parts for the customer to send to DG's repair\n\ndepot,  use the  change order  kits to  upgrade  a customer's\n\ncomputer, and  install spare  parts the customer  has ordered\n\nfrom DG.\n\n          Neither  equipment owners  nor  TPMs  may  purchase\n\nschematics  (blueprints  of  equipment  that   often  contain\n\nmanufacturing  secrets),  but   Grumman  has  not  introduced\n\nsufficient evidence that this policy constitutes exclusionary\n\nconduct.   Grumman's theory  below was  that DG's  refusal to\n\nsell  schematics to  TPMs prevented  TPMs from  acquiring the\n\ninformation   necessary   to   develop    fully   competitive\n\nsubstitutes  for  ADEX.   Even  a  monopolist, however,  \"may\n\nnormally keep  its innovations secret from its rivals as long\n\nas it wishes.\"   Berkey Photo, Inc. v.

DG's policy  might be exclusionary if DG  had sought\n\nto  alter  its   equipment  (and  therefore  the   schematics\n\ndescribing that equipment) in order to  prevent technological\n\nadvances by TPMs.  But, as the district court noted, \"Grumman\n\n.  . . makes no allegations that  DG has in fact attempted to\n\n                            -112-\n                             112\n\nsubvert  competitors'  efforts   to  develop  and   implement\n\ncompeting diagnostics.\"  Grumman II, 761 F.

Therefore, there was no error\n\nin  the  district  court's   entry  of  summary  judgment  on\n\nGrumman's monopolization claim.\n\n                             IV.\n                                \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  we affirm the  district\n\ncourt in every respect  save for its failure to  instruct the\n\njury on its duty to consider Grumman's plea for apportionment\n\nof Grumman's  nonduplicative profits.65   We remand  the case\n\nto  the district court for the sole purpose of resolving that\n\nissue.\n\n          So ordered.\n                     \n\n                    \n\n65.

DG claimed that Grumman had infringed DG's ADEX copyrights and misappropriated trade secrets embodied in ADEX.  A jury agreed, awarding DG $27,417,000 in damages (excluding prejudgment interest and attorney's fees).  Grumman contends that the district court prematurely dismissed its affirmative defenses and counterclaims and committed several errors during and after the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this case raises numerous issues touching on copyright law, Grumman's most intriguing argument--presented below as both a defense and a counterclaim--is that DG illegally maintained its monopoly in the market for service of DG computers by unilaterally refusing to license ADEX to Grumman and other competitors.  The antitrust claims are intriguing because they present a curious conflict, namely, whether (and to what extent) the antitrust laws, in the absence of any statutory exemption, must tolerate short-term harm to the competitive process when such harm is caused by the otherwise lawful exercise of an economically potent \"monopoly\" in a copyrighted work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a careful analysis, we affirm on all but one relatively minor issue concerning the calculation of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DG and Grumman are competitors in the market for service of computers manufactured by DG, and the present litigation stems from the evolving nature of their competitive relationship.  DG not only designs and manufactures computers, but also offers a line of products and services for the maintenance and repair of DG computers.  Although DG has no more than a 5% share of the highly competitive \"primary market\" for mini-computers, DG occupies approximately 90% of the \"aftermarket\" for service of DG computers.  As a group, various \"third party maintainers\" (\"TPMs\") earn roughly 7% of the service revenues;  Grumman is the leading TPM with approximately 3% of the available service business.  The remaining equipment owners (typically large companies in the high technology industry) generally maintain their own computers and peripherals, although they occasionally need outside service on a \"time and materials\" basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Computer Service:  Outputs and Inputs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Support service for DG computers entails a variety of activities and a corresponding array of goods and services.  The principal activities are maintenance and repair of computer equipment.  Maintenance includes care of parts subject to failure as well as replacement of hardware components to bring equipment up to date.  Repair involves the diagnosis and correction of hardware failure.  Service technicians remedy equipment problems either by actually mending a malfunctioning part (e.g., reformatting a \"broken\" disk drive) or replacing the part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of these support service \"outputs\" benefit from a range of \"inputs.\"   For example, engineering change orders, along with certain documentation and parts, allow service technicians to make technological updates to computer hardware.  In order to identify the existence and location of a malfunctioning part, a service technician may use diagnostics (now increasingly sophisticated software), schematics (maps of the location and function of hardware elements), and various types of documentation, together with the technician's own experience acquired by diagnosing equipment problems.  In order to actually mend a malfunctioning part, a technician might fix the part on the spot with routine tools or sophisticated software (e.g., a software diagnostic that can reformat a disk drive), or send the part to a repair depot run either by the technician's employer or another service organization.  The repair of a malfunctioning part often requires very detailed information about the part (such as the information provided by schematics and other documentation), and may in turn require smaller replacement parts.  Finally, replacement of parts naturally requires the availability of spares.  At the core of this litigation is a dispute about Grumman's access to software diagnostics and other service \"tools\" produced by DG for use in the repair, upgrading, and maintenance of DG equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. TPM Access to Service Inputs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DG's policies concerning TPM access to DG's service tools have developed over time.  As described below, DG's policies have evolved through three stages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Initial Suspicion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TPMs made their debut in the 1970s while DG was still relatively new to the computer manufacturing market.  DG was suspicious of the ability of TPMs, often run and staffed by former DG technicians, to service DG computers without running afoul of DG's intellectual property rights or confidentiality agreements binding on former DG employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1975, DG converted its suspicions into legal claims, filing suit against Lloyd Root and Robert Montgomery, two of its former employees, as well as Computer Systems Support Corporation (\"CSSC\"), the TPM that Root and Montgomery had founded after leaving DG.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  DG's principal allegations were that Root and Montgomery had breached their employment agreements by taking DG information with them when they left DG, and that CSSC personnel had been making unauthorized use of DG proprietary information.  It was unclear, however, whether the proprietary items that CSSC was using were items sold or licensed to equipment owners (pursuant to agreements which arguably permitted some use by TPMs),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> or items taken directly from DG by Root and Montgomery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lacking promising proof to support its claims, DG proposed a settlement whereby CSSC would agree to return any proprietary information that Root and Montgomery unlawfully took from DG, and DG would expressly authorize CSSC (and its successors) to use DG proprietary information in the maintenance and repair of DG computers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>  CSSC accepted, and the parties signed a settlement agreement in 1976 (\"the Settlement Agreement\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Peaceful Coexistence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1976 until some point in the mid-1980s, DG affirmatively encouraged the growth of TPMs with relatively liberal policies concerning TPM access to service tools.  DG sold or licensed diagnostics directly to TPMs, and allowed TPMs to use diagnostics sold or licensed to DG equipment owners.  DG did not restrict access by TPMs to spare parts manufactured by DG or other manufacturers.  DG allowed (or at least tolerated) requests by TPMs for DG's repair depot to fix malfunctioning circuit boards, the heart of a computer's central processing unit (\"CPU\").  DG sold at least some schematics and other documentation to TPMs.  DG also sold TPMs engineering change order kits.  And finally, DG training classes were open to TPM field engineers.  Grumman suggests that DG's liberal policies were beneficial to DG because increased capacity (and perhaps competition) in the service aftermarket would be a selling point for DG equipment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Increased Restrictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1980s, DG altered its strategy.  With the goal of maximizing revenues from its service business, DG began to refuse to provide many service tools directly to TPMs.  DG would not allow TPMs to use the DG repair depot, nor would it permit TPMs to purchase schematics, documentation, \"change order\" kits, or certain spare parts.  DG no longer allowed TPM technicians to attend DG training classes.  Finally, DG developed and severely restricted the licensing of ADEX, a new software diagnostic for its MV computers.  The MV series was at once DG's most advanced computer hardware and an increasingly important source of sales and service revenue for DG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of items unavailable to TPMs directly from DG were either available to all equipment owners (even customers of TPMs) from DG, or were available to TPMs from sources other than DG.  For example, DG depot service, change order kits, and at least some documentation were available to all equipment owners.  There is also evidence that Grumman had its own repair depot and that Grumman could make use of repair depots run by other service organizations (sometimes called \"fourth party maintainers\").  Likewise, there is evidence that TPMs could purchase at least some spare parts from sources other than DG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation was different with respect to ADEX.  DG service technicians would use ADEX in performing service for DG equipment owners.  DG would also license ADEX for the exclusive use of the in-house technicians of equipment owners who perform most of their own service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  However, DG would not license ADEX to its own service customers or to the customers of TPMs.  Nor was ADEX available to TPMs from sources other than DG.  At least two other diagnostics designed to service DG's MV computers may have become available as early as 1989, but no fully functional substitute was available when this case was tried in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman found various ways to skirt DG's ADEX restrictions.  Some former DG employees, in violation of their employment agreements, brought copies of ADEX when they joined Grumman.  In addition, DG field engineers often stored copies of ADEX at the work sites of their service customers, who were bound to preserve the confidentiality of any DG proprietary information in their possession.  Although DG service customers had an obligation to return copies of ADEX to DG should they cancel their service agreement and switch to a TPM, few customers did so.  It is essentially undisputed that Grumman technicians used and duplicated copies of ADEX left behind by DG field engineers.  There is also uncontroverted evidence that Grumman actually acquired copies of ADEX in this manner in order to maintain libraries of diagnostics so that Grumman technicians could freely duplicate and use any copy of ADEX to service any of Grumman's customers with DG's MV computers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Present Litigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, DG filed suit against Grumman in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  DG patterned its suit after a similar action it brought against Service &amp; Training, Inc.  (\"STI\") in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.  See Service &amp; Training, Inc. v. Data General Corp., 737 F.Supp. 334 (D.Md.1990), aff'd on other grounds, 963 F.2d 680 (4th Cir.1992) (\"STI \").   STI was another TPM in the DG aftermarket and a successor to Montgomery's interest in the 1976 Settlement Agreement.  In one count, DG alleged that Grumman's use and duplication of ADEX infringed DG's ADEX copyrights, and requested injunctive relief, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 502 (1988), as well as actual damages and profits, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(b) (1988).  In another count, DG alleged that Grumman had violated Massachusetts trade secrets law by misappropriating copies of ADEX in violation of confidentiality agreements binding on former DG employees and DG service customers.  On December 29, 1988, the district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Grumman from using ADEX.  See Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., No. 88-0033-S, 1988 WL 159936 (D.Mass. Dec. 29, 1988) (\"Grumman I \").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The parties then prepared for trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Pre-Trial Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman raised a host of affirmative defenses and counterclaims, all eventually rejected by the district court in response to DG's motions for partial summary judgment.  Three of these issues play a pivotal role in Grumman's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>a. 1976 Settlement Agreement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman alleged that the 1976 Settlement Agreement authorized it (as a successor to CSSC) to \"acquire, possess, copy and use\" all DG diagnostics, including ADEX.  Liberally construed, Grumman's allegation of a right to \"copy and use\" ADEX fairly includes an allegation that Grumman has a right to copy and use DG diagnostic software in the possession of DG equipment owners.  Judge Skinner rejected the Settlement Agreement defense by adopting the reasoning of the STI courts, which had rebuffed the same arguments on a nearly identical record.  See Grumman V, 834 F.Supp. at 482-83.   In the district court decision in STI, Judge Motz analyzed the language of the Settlement Agreement, testimony from the lawyers who negotiated it, and evidence of the parties' subsequent conduct.  737 F.Supp. at 339-41.   On the basis of this evidence, Judge Motz concluded that the Settlement Agreement did not require DG to license any proprietary information to CSSC or its customers, nor did the Settlement Agreement prevent DG from prohibiting CSSC from copying and using proprietary information in the custody of DG service customers.

Secs. 1 and 2 (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Specifically, Grumman charged that DG misused its copyrights by (1) tying the availability of ADEX to a consumer's agreement either to purchase DG support services (a \"positive tie\") or not to purchase support services from TPMs (a \"negative tie\"), and (2) willfully maintaining its monopoly in the support services aftermarket by imposing the alleged tie-in and refusing to deal with TPMs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerning the tying claim, the district court again adopted the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit in STI, this time for the proposition that there was insufficient proof of a tying agreement to withstand summary judgment.  Grumman V, 834 F.Supp. at 484-85.   The Fourth Circuit held that there was no positive tie for two independent reasons.  First, the court noted that DG did not actually license ADEX to its service customers.  STI, 963 F.2d at 686-87.   Second, the court held that there was not enough evidence to prove that any license to use ADEX was conditioned on the purchase of DG support services.  Id. at 687.   The court noted that there was no explicit tying condition in any written agreement.  Id.  The court also noted that there was insufficient evidence of unwilling purchases of DG support service so as to justify an inference of an implicit condition;  customers may simply prefer service supported by ADEX diagnostics over service that is not.  Id. at 687-88.   The court further held that there was insufficient evidence of a negative tie because, on the record before the court, \"[t]he fact that CMOs do not purchase repair services ... is at least as consistent with the legitimate and independent business decision not to purchase unneeded services as it is with an agreement not to purchase such services.\"  Id. at 686.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Skinner conducted his own exhaustive analysis of the monopolization claim, concluding that Grumman failed to \"assert[ ] any facts that would indicate that DG has engaged in any unlawful exclusionary conduct.\"  Grumman II, 761 F.Supp. at 192.   The court essentially narrowed the question to whether DG's restrictive policies with respect to TPMs constitute unlawful unilateral refusals to deal, reasoning that DG's actions do not rise to the level of unlawful exclusionary conduct for several reasons.  The court agreed with Grumman that this case, like Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 105 S.Ct. 2847, 86 L.Ed.2d 467 (1985), raises \"the issue of prior promotion of competition in a market that is later halted,\" Grumman II, 761 F.Supp. at 190.   The district court nonetheless concluded that Grumman had failed to demonstrate that DG's restrictive policies have unreasonably harmed the competitive process.  In particular, the court noted that DG's policies with respect to most service products do not prevent TPMs from competing in the service market because \"DG will sell its service products, except [ADEX and schematics], to any ultimate consumer regardless of whether [the consumer] now or later use[s] a TPM.\"  Id. at 191.   The court also observed that \"TPMs have demonstrated the ability to develop diagnostics [without schematics], even if they are not as efficient as MV/ADEX.\"  Id.  Lastly, the court suggested that the Sherman Act would not compel DG to disclose its schematics, in part because such compulsory disclosure would undermine the incentives of copyright and patent laws.  Id. at 192.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting Grumman's motion for reconsideration of the grant of summary judgment on the monopolization claim, the district court also directly addressed Grumman's contention that DG's refusal to license ADEX to TPMs constitutes exclusionary conduct.  The court stated that DG's refusal to license ADEX to TPMs was not exclusionary because \"DG offers to the public a license to use MV/ADEX on any computer owned by the customer,\" and therefore DG \" 'did not withhold from one member of the public a service offered to the rest[.]' \"  Grumman III, slip op. at 5 (citing Olympia Equip.  Leasing Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 797 F.2d 370, 377 (7th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 934, 107 S.Ct. 1574, 94 L.Ed.2d 765 (1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>c.

Sec. 301 (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992), preempts DG's state law action for misappropriation of trade secrets.  The district court held that DG's trade secrets claim was not preempted because DG did not simply allege conduct equivalent to the copying and use which form the basis of an infringement claim;  instead, DG's trade secrets claim was based on Grumman's acquisition of ADEX in violation of confidentiality agreements binding on former DG employees and service customers.  Grumman IV, 795 F.Supp. at 507.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Trial Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stripped of its affirmative defenses, Grumman proceeded to trial.  Grumman focused its defensive energies in two areas.  Grumman attacked DG's proof of the prima facie elements of copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets, and attempted to undermine DG's broad-gauged request for compensation for lost profits and disgorgement of Grumman's MV-related profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>a. Validity of Copyright Registration</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, it became evident that DG had made several errors in registering its ADEX copyrights.  After Edward Gove, a DG official, testified that DG had deposited with the Copyright Office the correct excerpts of human-readable \"source code,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Grumman introduced evidence that there were some errors in the deposits for the first three versions of ADEX.  In rebuttal testimony, Gove confirmed that there were a number of minor, inadvertent errors in the deposits that would not affect the operation of the programs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman argued to the district court that any error in a copyright deposit renders the registration invalid, and requested that the court so instruct the jury.  The district court refused, instructing the jury instead that minor, inadvertent errors in the deposit of excerpts of computer code do not threaten the validity of the copyright registration.  As a fall-back tactic, Grumman renewed its previous request that the district court compel DG to produce the entire human-readable source code for each version of ADEX so that Grumman could more effectively cross-examine Gove about the significance of the errors.  The district court refused to do so, and later explained its discretionary decision by finding that \"Grumman had an adequate opportunity to explore the errors contained in the initial copyright deposits, to challenge Data General's explanation of those errors, and to argue these issues before the jury.\"  Grumman VI, 825 F.Supp. at 352.   Using a special verdict form, the jury found that DG had properly registered each of the ADEX copyrights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>b. Actual Damages and Profits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman argued that the jury should identify and ignore that portion of Grumman's profits which was not attributable to Grumman's use of ADEX.  To this end, Grumman introduced evidence that some of its revenues were derived from servicing DG computers that cannot or need not be serviced with ADEX, and that the value of Grumman's use of ADEX to service customers with MV computers was distinct from the value of other products and services Grumman provided to those customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, DG offered evidence that because equipment owners prefer to purchase all service from one vendor, equipment owners with both MV computers and other DG computers (\"mixed-equipment customers\") would not have purchased service from Grumman if Grumman had lacked access to ADEX.  DG also offered evidence tending to show that, even if Grumman did not always use ADEX in servicing a computer, Grumman could not have attracted and retained its MV-related business had it not been for Grumman's use of ADEX.  DG's expert witness opined that DG's damages totaled $28,003,000-$26,364,000 in DG's lost profits and $1,639,000 in nonduplicative profits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> earned by Grumman as a result of its acquisition and use of ADEX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to blunt at least part of DG's sweeping \"but for\" theory, Grumman asked the district court to instruct the jury to discount that portion of Grumman's profits which was not attributable to the infringement.  The court instructed the jury that DG could recover that portion of Grumman's profits that was \"attributable to the infringement,\" but did not elaborate on the jury's task in this regard.  Left to choose between the parties' theories, the jury apparently accepted the essence of DG's theory, though the total award of compensatory damages was $27,417,000, somewhat less than DG requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Post-Trial Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman sought relief from the judgment on a number of grounds, two of which are most relevant to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>a. Actual Damages and Profits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claiming that the jury's award was speculative and excessive, Grumman moved for a new trial or, in the alternative, remittitur.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a).  As the district court related:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>Grumman complains that the jury awarded speculative and excessive damages because it uncritically adopted the plaintiff's damage analysis in its entirety which was built on theoretically unsound and factually inaccurate assumptions.  More specifically, defendant contends that the plaintiff's damage analysis failed to identify relevant revenues, failed to apply a reasonable profit margin, and failed to apportion service profits between infringing and non-infringing activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman VI, 825 F.Supp. at 349 (footnote omitted).  The district court denied the motion, ruling in essence that DG's theory of damages was proper and that the jury was free to weigh the testimony of DG's experts more heavily than that of Grumman's experts.  Id. at 349-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>b. Attorney's Fees</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court included in its judgment order an award of attorney's fees under the Copyright Act, although it appears that the court has not yet fixed the amount.  Grumman argued that the court should not award attorney's fees because DG had \"elected\" only those remedies available under Massachusetts trade secrets law, which does not allow an award of attorney's fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  The district court denied the motion, finding that DG had merely sought to maximize the judgment by selecting the most generous body of law for each element of its recovery.  Grumman VI, 825 F.Supp. at 346.   The district court reasoned further that because DG would not receive a double award of attorney's fees, the judgment was in no need of correction.  Id. at 346-47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Issues on Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman renews its arguments concerning the pretrial, trial, and post-trial issues described above.  Grumman claims that the district court erred in entering summary judgment on its affirmative defenses, questions the propriety of certain of the district court's jury instructions, maintains that the jury's award of damages lacks evidentiary support, and insists that DG is not entitled to recover attorney's fees.  After reviewing the procedural rules that govern this appeal, we address each of Grumman's arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this appeal turns largely on questions of law, we outline the corresponding standard of review.  Although the reasoning of the court below may provide a useful starting point for analysis, the district court's view of the law is not binding on a court of appeals.  See Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir.1993) (citing Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1992)).  Thus, we exercise our independent judgment in evaluating the legal correctness of the district court's jury instructions.  Likewise, we must reach our own conclusion as to a statute's correct construction.  See FDIC v. Keating, 12 F.3d 314, 316 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in reviewing a district court's entry of summary judgment, we determine anew whether the moving party has shown \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  See also Bird v. Centennial Ins. Co., 11 F.3d 228, 231 (1st Cir.1993).  \"In this context, 'genuine' means that the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party and 'material' means that the fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\"  Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir.1993) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).  Although \"we read the record and indulge all inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party,\" Rivera-Ruiz v. Gonzalez-Rivera, 983 F.2d 332, 334 (1st Cir.1993), the adverse party cannot defeat a well-supported motion by \"rest[ing] upon the mere allegations or denials of [its] pleading,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).  If the nonmovant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to its claim or defense, it may avert summary judgment only if it identifies issues genuinely in dispute and advances convincing theories as to their materiality.  See Pagano, 983 F.2d at 347 (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2509-10, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).  Of course, it may be difficult for a trial court to forecast the reaction of a reasonable jury to an intricate array of complex theories.  Nonetheless, Rule 56 applies equally to simple cases as well as cases involving complicated legal principles and theories of recovery.  See, e.g., Amerinet, Inc. v. Xerox Corp., 972 F.2d 1483, 1490 (8th Cir.1992) (\"In complex antitrust cases, no different or heightened standard for the grant of summary judgment applies.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1048, 122 L.Ed.2d 356 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that we are at liberty to affirm a district court's grant of summary judgment \" 'on any ground supported in the record even if the issue was not pleaded, tried or otherwise referred to in the proceedings below.' \"  de Casenave v. United States, 991 F.2d 11, 12 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. DG's Intellectual Property Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first examine the two arguments that strike at the heart of DG's right to pursue its claims:  DG's alleged failure to comply with the copyright registration requirements and the possible preemption of the state trade secrets claim by Section 301 of the Copyright Act.  We then discuss Grumman's two affirmative defenses--the 1976 Settlement Agreement defense and the \"misuse\" defense--each of which is intended to undermine both the copyright claim and the trade secrets claim.  Finally, we review Grumman's challenges to the award of actual damages, infringer's profits, and attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Validity of Copyright Registration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Registration of a work with the Copyright Office provides several benefits to a plaintiff in an infringement action.  First, although copyright protection attaches the day original expression is fixed in a tangible medium, see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 102(a) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992), and thus an infringer may be liable for infringement from that day forward, see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 408(a) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992) (providing that \"registration is not a condition of copyright protection\"), registration of the copyright is a prerequisite to suit under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 411(a) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).  Second, upon accepting the registrant's application, fee, and deposit of a representative copy of the work, see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 408, the Copyright Office issues a certificate of registration, which is admissible in an infringement action as \"prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate,\" 17 U.S.C. Sec. 410(c) (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  In the case of computer programs which, like ADEX, are either unpublished or published only in machine-readable form, the copyright owner must deposit \"identifying portions of the program,\" generally the first and last 25 pages of the human-readable source code.  37 C.F.R. Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(vii) (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  By questioning DG's compliance with the registration requirements, Grumman is effectively claiming that (1) DG may not claim infringement of those ADEX copyrights for which DG tendered a defective deposit;  and (2) even if DG is free to bring such claims, it is not entitled to a presumption as to the validity of the copyrights at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, Grumman's argument is that the district court erred in instructing the jury that minor, inadvertent errors in material deposited with a registration application do not affect the validity of the registration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  DG admits that there were inadvertent errors in the material deposited with the registration application for ADEX Revisions 0.0 to 2.0,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> but maintains that the errors are inconsequential.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Grumman does not quibble with DG's denial of intent, but argues in effect that any error, however minor, precludes a finding that the plaintiff complied with Section 408(b).  Alternatively, Grumman argues that an unintentional error in the deposit may still invalidate a copyright registration if the error is material.  Grumman contends further that the district court erred in refusing Grumman's request for production of the entire source code for each of the first three versions of ADEX, a decision which allegedly prejudiced Grumman's ability to demonstrate that the defects in the deposit were not minor.  We address these contentions seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>a. Immaterial Errors in the Copyright Deposit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that immaterial, inadvertent errors in an application for copyright registration do not jeopardize the validity of the registration.  See Masquerade Novelty, Inc. v. Unique Indus., Inc., 912 F.2d 663, 667-68 &amp; n. 5 (3d Cir.1990);  Whimsicality, Inc. v. Rubie's Costume Co., 891 F.2d 452, 456 (2d Cir.1989) (citing Eckes v. Card Prices Update, 736 F.2d 859, 861-62 (2d Cir.1984));  Harris v. Emus Records Corp., 734 F.2d 1329, 1335 (9th Cir.1984);  Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Toy Loft, Inc., 684 F.2d 821, 828 (11th Cir.1982);  2 Nimmer Sec. 7.20, at 7-201 (\"[A] misstatement or clerical error in the registration application if unaccompanied by fraud will not invalidate the copyright nor render the registration certificate incapable of supporting an infringement action.\").  In general, an error is immaterial if its discovery is not likely to have led the Copyright Office to refuse the application.  See Eckes, 736 F.2d at 861-62.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman observes that the cases approving substantial compliance with registration requirements concern errors in the application, not the deposit, and suggests that we adopt a rule demanding strict compliance with the deposit requirement.  Although a different rule for deposit errors might be warranted if the language and underlying purposes of the deposit requirement were of a significantly different character than that of the application requirement, we do not find that to be the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the registration application described in Section 409, as well as the deposit described in Section 408(b), are both equally mandatory components of the registration process outlined in Section 408(a).  Likewise, just as Section 409 sets forth what an application \"shall include,\" (emphasis added), Section 408(b) uses the same phrase to prescribe the contents of the deposit.  There is nothing in this language that would prevent our interpreting both the application requirements and the deposit requirements in a consistent and practical manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do the apparent purposes of the deposit requirement counsel a different result.  Although related to the deposit requirement in Section 407, which is designed to further the acquisitions policy of the Library of Congress, the deposit required by Section 408(b) serves the separate purpose of providing the Library's Copyright Office with sufficient material to identify the work in which the registrant claims a copyright.  See H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5766-70;  see also 37 C.F.R. Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(vii) (requiring deposit of \"identifying portions\" of programs that are unpublished or published only in machine-readable form).  In other words, a key purpose of the Section 408(b) deposit requirement is to prevent confusion about which work the author is attempting to register.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second apparent aim of Section 408(b) is to furnish the Copyright Office with an opportunity to assess the copyrightability of the applicant's work.  Pursuant to the Copyright Act, the Register of Copyrights must register a copyright claim and issue a registration certificate \"[w]hen, after examination, the Register ... determines that ... the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter.\"  17 U.S.C. Sec. 410(a) (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Some provisions of the copyright regulations seek to preserve the same opportunity for examination in relation to the deposit of a relatively small subset of a computer program.  In adopting regulations encouraging source code deposits for computer programs, the Copyright Office explained that \"[i]n registering all copyright claims, the Copyright Office examines the deposit to determine the existence of copyrightable authorship.\"  54 Fed.Reg. 13,173 (1989).  In order to allow the Office to continue this practice, the new regulations provide, for example, that when the applicant's deposit contains portions of the source code of an unpublished computer program with blocked-out trade secrets the deposit must still \"reveal[ ] an appreciable amount of original computer code.\"   See 37 C.F.R. Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(vii)(A)(2) (emphasis added).  On the other hand, where there are no blocked-out portions in the deposited portions of a computer program, the regulations do not specifically require that the deposit contain \"an appreciable amount of original computer code.\"   In other words, the Copyright Office seems to have assumed that in such cases the deposited pages are likely to contain sufficient elements of original expression to determine the copyrightability of the work at issue.  At any rate, it appears that Congress viewed the deposit requirement as a means of collecting information that the Copyright Office may use in resolving the question of copyrightability for the purposes of Section 410.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these objectives differs so significantly from those of the application requirement as to justify a departure from the rule governing application errors.  Quite naturally, one important function of a registration application is to identify the work in which the applicant claims a copyright.  See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 409 (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992) (requiring application to include, inter alia, title of work, dates of completion and publication, along with \"any other information ... bearing upon the ... identification of the work\").  Furthermore, like the deposit, the application also provides some evidence of copyrightability, because it must identify any preexisting work from which the author borrowed in creating a compilation or derivative work.  See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 409(9).  Indeed, the Copyright Office may often be in a better position to assess the originality of the work being registered by reviewing a list of preexisting works than by conducting a cursory inspection of the deposited material.  And yet, an inadvertent failure to identify preexisting works on an application is treated no differently from any other application error.  See, e.g., Toy Loft, 684 F.2d at 828 (analyzing in similar fashion failure to mention co-author and failure to mention preexisting works).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that there is no support in law or reason for a rule that penalizes immaterial, inadvertent errors in a copyright deposit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Accordingly, we find no flaw in the district court's instruction that such errors \"do not impeach the validity and effect of the registration.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>b.

No court has suggested that a registration premised in part on an unintentional material error would fail to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of Section 411(a).  At the same time, at least one court has suggested that in such instances the proper approach might be to prevent the plaintiff from exploiting the presumption of validity that ordinarily attaches to a registered copyright under Section 410(c).  Masquerade Novelty, 912 F.2d at 668 n. 5 (dictum).  We assume for argument's sake that a material error in a copyright deposit, even if unintentional, may destroy the presumption of validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>c. Refusal to Compel Production of Source Code</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman next argues that it was unfairly deprived of an opportunity to prove that the errors in the deposits were material.  Specifically, Grumman claims that the district court abused its discretion when, during the trial, it refused to compel DG to produce roughly 40,000 pages of source code (on approximately 33,000 floppy disks) for each of the first three versions of ADEX (0.0 to 2.0).  See Geremia v. First Nat'l Bank, 653 F.2d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1981) (reviewing denial of mid-trial discovery motion for abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman renewed its unsuccessful pre-trial requests for the source code after Edward Gove, a DG witness, admitted on cross-examination that there were some discrepancies between the source code deposited with the Copyright Office and the actual source code for ADEX 0.0 to 2.0, and then explained in rebuttal testimony that those errors were minor and of no consequence to the operation of the diagnostic program as a whole.  In response to the renewed request, DG provided Grumman with those portions of the source codes for ADEX Revisions 0.0 to 2.0 necessary to conduct a character-by-character comparison of the intended deposits of source code with those portions of source code actually deposited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Nonetheless, Grumman insisted that it was entitled to the entire source code for all three versions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman apparently sought the three sets of source code because it believed that analysis of the entire source code would permit a more effective cross-examination of the DG witness about the magnitude of the discrepancies during DG's rebuttal.  It seems that Grumman had one main goal:  it believed it might be able to show that, although the discrepancies were few in number and seemingly minor in character, ADEX would not function properly if the source code deposited with the Copyright Office had been inserted into the versions of ADEX DG intended to register.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The marginal benefit to Grumman of obtaining the balance of the source code was at best highly uncertain, and all indications were that such a test would produce no compelling results.  Even if Grumman could demonstrate that inserting the errors would impair the operation of ADEX, it is extremely unlikely that this would establish the materiality of the errors.  Grumman does not allege that any of the errors, if discovered, would have led the Copyright Office to refuse registration of DG's copyright claims.  Nor does Grumman contend that the Copyright Office would have been unable to use the correct portions of the deposits to identify the works DG intended to register or make a preliminary determination concerning the copyrightability of those works.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  In contrast, DG produced evidence that production of the requested material would be an extremely cumbersome process, a point Grumman does not contest.  We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision to deny Grumman's mid-trial discovery request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Preemption of Trade Secrets Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking to avoid the additional damages associated with the trade secrets remedies selected by DG, Grumman argues that the state claim is preempted by Section 301 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 301(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 301(a) precludes enforcement of any state cause of action which is equivalent in substance to a federal copyright infringement claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  See generally Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chem.  Indus., Ltd., 9 F.3d 823, 846-47 (10th Cir.1993);  Trandes Corp. v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 996 F.2d 655, 658-60 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 443, 126 L.Ed.2d 377 (1993);  1 Nimmer Sec. 1.01[B][h], at 1-35 to 1-36.1.  Courts have developed a functional test to assess the question of equivalence.  \"[I]f a state cause of action requires an extra element, beyond mere copying, preparation of derivative works, performance, distribution or display, then the state cause of action is qualitatively different from, and not subsumed within, a copyright infringement claim and federal law will not preempt the state action.\"  Gates Rubber, 9 F.3d at 847 (citing Computer Assocs.  Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693, 716 (2nd Cir.1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not every \"extra element\" of a state claim will establish a qualitative variance between the rights protected by federal copyright law and those protected by state law.  For example, a state claim of tortious interference with contractual relations may require elements of awareness and intentional interference not necessary for proof of copyright infringement.  And yet, such an action is equivalent in substance to a copyright infringement claim where the additional elements merely concern the extent to which authors and their licensees can prohibit unauthorized copying by third parties.  Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 723 F.2d 195, 201 (2d Cir.1983), rev'd on other grounds, 471 U.S. 539, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985).  Similarly, a state law misappropriation claim will not escape preemption under Section 301(a) simply because a plaintiff must prove that copying was not only unauthorized but also \"commercial[ly] immoral[,]\" a mere \"label attached to [the same] odious business conduct.\"  Mayer v. Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons, Ltd., 601 F.Supp. 1523, 1535 (S.D.N.Y.1985).  Nonetheless, a trade secrets claim that requires proof of a breach of a duty of confidentiality stands on a different footing.  Such claims are not preempted because participation in the breach of a duty of confidentiality--an element that forms no part of a copyright infringement claim--represents unfair competitive conduct qualitatively different from mere unauthorized copying.  See Gates Rubber, 9 F.3d at 847-48;  Trandes Corp., 996 F.2d at 660;  Computer Associates, 982 F.2d at 717;  S.O.S., Inc. v. Payday, Inc., 886 F.2d 1081, 1090 n. 13 (9th Cir.1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DG's trade secrets claim fits comfortably within this category.  To demonstrate misappropriation of trade secrets under Massachusetts law, DG must prove that \"(1) MV/ADEX is a trade secret;  (2) Data General took reasonable steps to preserve the secrecy of MV/ADEX;  and (3) Grumman used improper means, in breach of a confidential relationship, to acquire and use the trade secret.\"  Grumman VI, 825 F.Supp. at 357 (citing, inter alia, J.T. Healy &amp; Son, Inc. v. James A. Murphy &amp; Son, Inc., 357 Mass. 728, 260 N.E.2d 723, 729-31 (1970)).  The district court instructed the jury that \"wrongful acquisition\" is an element of a Massachusetts trade secrets claim, and that \"[a]cquisition of a trade secret is wrongful ... if it is by theft of property known to belong to another, or by knowing participation in the breach of an express or implied confidentiality agreement by, for instance, a former employee or customer of Data General.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Grumman does not assign error to this portion of the charge, which thus becomes the law of the case.  See United States v. Connell, 6 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that unchallenged legal decisions are ordinarily unassailable at later stages in litigation).  Furthermore, DG's theory was precisely that Grumman acquired ADEX by participating in the breach of confidentiality agreements binding on former employees and service customers of DG.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  Because the Copyright Act does not prevent the states from imposing liability for such conduct, the district court was correct to spare DG's trade secrets claim from preemption under Section 301(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. 1976 Settlement Agreement Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman denies its liability for copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets, arguing that the Settlement Agreement contains a license allowing Grumman to copy and use ADEX in the maintenance and repair of DG computers.  The district court granted DG's motion for partial summary judgment on this issue, and Grumman now appeals that decision on two alternative grounds:  (1) the Settlement Agreement unambiguously grants Grumman a license to use ADEX;  or (2) the Settlement Agreement is at least ambiguous, and conflicting extrinsic evidence about the scope of the license presents a factual dispute worthy of resolution by a jury.a. Maryland Contract Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that the Settlement Agreement, executed in Maryland, is governed by Maryland contract law.  Maryland courts do not follow the subjective theory of contracts, which aims to discover the actual intent of the parties even at the expense of unambiguous language to the contrary.  See Hershon v. Gibraltar Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 864 F.2d 848, 851 (D.C.Cir.1989) (applying Maryland law).  Instead, Maryland subscribes to the objective approach.  See id.   Under that approach, a court may consider extrinsic evidence only in determining whether contract language is ambiguous.  See id. at 852.   However, as long as the result is objectively reasonable, a court may not use extrinsic evidence \"to interpret facially explicit contractual terms.\"  Id. at 851-52.   See also General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, 303 Md. 254, 492 A.2d 1306, 1310 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where contract terms are ambiguous, a court may look to extrinsic evidence in order to ascertain the intention of the parties and, if successful, interpret the contract as a matter of law.  See Collier v. MD-Individual Practice Ass'n, 327 Md. 1, 607 A.2d 537, 541 (1992);  Truck Ins. Exch. v. Marks Rentals, Inc., 288 Md. 428, 418 A.2d 1187, 1190 (1980).  If, after such examination, the meaning of the ambiguous terms remains in genuine dispute, and the dispute is material to the outcome of the claim or defense at issue, the ambiguity must be resolved by the trier of fact.  See id.;  Monumental Life Ins. Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 94 Md.App. 505, 617 A.2d 1163, 1174 (\"Only when there is a bona fide ambiguity in the contract's language or legitimate doubt as to its application under the circumstances is the contract submitted to the trier of the fact for interpretation.\"), cert. denied, 330 Md. 319, 624 A.2d 491 (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p>b. Areas of Agreement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to focus our analysis of DG's entitlement to summary judgment, we first determine the reach of Grumman's contentions in light of the existing areas of agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the parties agree that the existence and scope of a license turn on the interpretation of the \"maintenance or repair\" exception to the general prohibition of paragraph four of the Settlement Agreement, which provides that Grumman's predecessor \"will not, directly or indirectly, copy or utilize 'Proprietary Information' of DG for the design or manufacture of computers or any other purpose.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>  In addition, DG admits that the Settlement Agreement gives Grumman a right to use some of DG's proprietary information for some purposes.  Although DG denies that the Settlement Agreement allows Grumman to use ADEX itself, DG nonetheless admitted in its answers to Grumman's request for admissions \"that, as part of the settlement of the CSSC litigation, Data General agreed that CSSC could use Data General proprietary information that was defined in the Agreement and the nature of which was then understood by and agreed to by the parties, to maintain or repair Data General computers.\"   While the Settlement Agreement does not bear many of the traits of a traditional licensing agreement, it does grant some permission to use DG's intellectual property, at least in certain circumstances, and therefore creates some type of \"license.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>  Consequently, Grumman's defense turns on the scope of the license.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also worthy of note are undisputed facts concerning the nature of Grumman's acquisition and use of ADEX.  Grumman did not simply gain access to copies of ADEX left at the sites of former DG service customers solely for the purpose of using on-site maintenance tools to service computers at that site.  Rather, Grumman acquired copies of ADEX from former service customers in an effort to expand its own library of MV diagnostic software, which Grumman technicians freely copied and used in servicing the computers of any Grumman customer with MV equipment.  Moreover, there is no evidence that Grumman acquired ADEX from equipment owners at a time when those equipment owners were also customers of DG.  Nor is there evidence that Grumman acquired ADEX directly from DG, or from current or former CMO customers.  In addition, the record reveals that DG service customers were contractually bound both to prevent ADEX from falling into the hands of third parties such as TPMs and to return copies of ADEX to DG after the termination of the relevant service agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  Thus, Grumman acquired ADEX from those customers who no longer had lawful possession of the program and had no right to transfer it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question we must resolve is whether the \"maintenance or repair\" exception authorized Grumman both to gain access to and acquire copies of ADEX in the possession of former DG service customers despite the fact that these customers had agreed not only to prevent such third-party access but also to return copies of ADEX to DG after the termination of their service contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>c. Scope of the License</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of the Settlement Agreement does not answer our question.  Despite the fact that the exception anticipates that Grumman will \"copy or utilize\" DG proprietary information for the \"maintenance and repair of DGC equipment,\" the Settlement Agreement does not specify whether it merely refers to Grumman's right to gain access to maintenance tools it finds at a customer site (including the routine copying and use inherent in the operation of a computer program), or whether the exception somehow allows Grumman to acquire such tools for the service of DG computers at other sites.  Similarly, the Settlement Agreement contains no prescription for resolving potential conflicts between the \"maintenance or repair\" exception and provisions in DG's Service Agreement prohibiting third-party access during the term of the Agreement and retention of DG proprietary information thereafter.  Accordingly, we turn to the extrinsic evidence in the record in an attempt to resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when viewed in a light most favorable to Grumman, the record evidence makes clear that the parties to the Settlement Agreement intended the \"maintenance and repair\" exception to function as what we shall call a \"third-party access agreement,\" allowing CSSC, Grumman's predecessor in interest, to gain access to proprietary information that DG sold, licensed, or otherwise entrusted to owners of DG equipment.  For example, when called to testify in the STI litigation, Edward Canfield, CSSC's attorney at the time, used these words to describe his contemporary understanding of the \"maintenance and repair\" exception:  \"If the customer had it, [CSSC] had a right to use it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  In addition, the language of DG licensing agreements in the 1970s as well as the pleadings in the 1975 litigation strongly corroborate the view that the settlement negotiations primarily concerned CSSC's right to use proprietary information in the hands of DG equipment owners.  As late as 1976, DG licensed proprietary maintenance information to equipment owners under an agreement which specifically allowed licensees to grant access to third parties \"on LICENSEE's premises with LICENSEE's permission for purposes specifically related to LICENSEE's use of the Licensed Program.\"   Moreover, in its 1975 counterclaim, CSSC intimated that DG had begun to undermine the ability of TPMs to gain access to maintenance information in the hands of equipment owners, alleging that DG had attempted \"to prevent owners of DGC Mini-computers from having their equipment serviced and maintained by any competitor of DGC ... by restricting the use those owners make of their owner maintenance information.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also specific evidence that the parties to the Settlement Agreement were not negotiating about the ongoing transfer of proprietary information directly from DG to CSSC.  For example, during the STI trial, counsel for DG asked Canfield whether, under the Settlement Agreement, DG had an \"obligation to give [CSSC] something.\"  \"No sir,\" replied Canfield, \"Data General was not offering to give us anything.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of the \"maintenance and repair\" exception as a third-party access agreement has several ramifications.  As a provision designed to ensure access to Grumman, the exception was arguably intended to override contrary restrictions in proprietary legends and confidentiality agreements.  Indeed, there is evidence that this was the case.  A letter to Canfield from Carl Kaplan, a lawyer who represented DG in the settlement negotiations, outlined the proposed settlement, stating that improper utilization of DG proprietary information \"would be the use of that information other than as marked by DGC or without DGC's express written permission.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Kaplan added that \"[u]se of DGC proprietary information for the maintenance of DGC equipment would expressly be permitted the defendants.\"   Id.  In addition, Canfield's deposition testimony suggests that his primary concern was for DG to guarantee CSSC's right to use proprietary information distributed to DG equipment owners, notwithstanding future restrictions on third-party access to such information.  Thus, a jury could reasonably conclude that the Settlement Agreement allowed Grumman to gain access to information in the hands of DG equipment owners for the purpose of maintaining DG computers, even if equipment owners generally could not allow third parties access to DG proprietary information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Characterizing the exception as a third-party access agreement also means that Grumman's right to use copies of ADEX in the possession of DG equipment owners is necessarily derivative of the rights of those equipment owners.  As a consequence, Grumman only has the right to operate a customer's copy of ADEX for the benefit of that customer;  there is no basis for the proposition that Grumman can use its third-party access rights to acquire copies of ADEX for unlimited copying and use in the service of any MV computer.  Indeed, this was the import of Canfield's testimony in STI.   Referring to a CSSC customer as a \"party,\" Canfield stated that he understood the Settlement Agreement to allow \"[CSSC] to use whatever [was] on the party's equipment ... for the repair and maintenance of that party's equipment.\"  (Emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  Furthermore, to the extent that an equipment owner no longer has the right to possess copies of ADEX, as in the case of a former DG service customer, Grumman's rights as a third party are extinguished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we conclude that the Settlement Agreement merely grants Grumman the right to gain access to copies of ADEX lawfully possessed by a DG equipment owner in order to service the computers of that particular equipment owner.  Because Grumman's copying and use of ADEX does not fall within this category, the Settlement Agreement does not serve as a defense either to the infringement action or the trade secrets claims.  The district court did not err in granting partial summary judgment for DG on Grumman's Settlement Agreement defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Misuse Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman claims that DG is not entitled to enforce its copyrights or its rights under state trade secrets law because it has \"misused\" those property rights by engaging in anti-competitive behavior in violation of federal antitrust laws.  DG argues that there is no \"copyright misuse\" defense to a federal copyright infringement claim and no applicable \"unclean hands\" defense to the state claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.  Alternatively, DG argues that it did not violate the antitrust laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"copyright misuse\" defense is not without legal support.  In a carefully reasoned opinion, the Fourth Circuit recently approved such a defense after noting that it has long been recognized in the analogous context of patent infringement.  See Lasercomb America, Inc. v. Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970, 976 (4th Cir.1990) (\"[S]ince copyright and patent law serve parallel public interests, a 'misuse' defense should apply to infringement actions brought to vindicate either right.\");   see also 3 Nimmer Sec. 13.09[A], at 13-269 to 13-276 (collecting conflicting decisions of lower courts);  Ramsey Hanna, Note, Misusing Antitrust:  The Search for Functional Copyright Misuse Standards, 46 Stan.L.Rev. 361, 404-10 (1994) (charting the development of the copyright misuse defense).  Although DG correctly notes that the misuse in Lasercomb (conditioning a copyright license on a noncompetition agreement) is not identical to the misuse alleged in this case (tying access to ADEX to the purchase of DG service and refusing to license ADEX to TPMs), the reasoning of Lasercomb does not turn on the particular type of anti-competitive behavior alleged.  DG also suggests that the policy rationale for a copyright misuse defense is weaker than in the case of patent misuse because an exclusive right to express an idea in a particular way (a copyright) is a lesser threat to competition than an exclusive right to use the idea itself (a patent).  We acknowledge that it is often more difficult to prove an antitrust violation when the claim rests on the questionable market power associated with a copyright, but that would not be a reason to prohibit a defendant from attempting to meet its burden of proof, and would be a poor reason to refrain entirely from recognizing a copyright misuse defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, this case does not require us to decide whether the federal copyright law permits a misuse defense.  Nor need we determine whether Massachusetts recognizes an unclean hands defense to a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.  Grumman does not claim that DG misused its copyright or acted inequitably in any fashion other than through its alleged violations of the Sherman Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a>  And, because we conclude infra, Section III.B., that there is insufficient evidence to justify a trial on either of Grumman's antitrust counterclaims, Grumman's misuse and unclean hands defenses are equally devoid of merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman's principal assault on the jury's award of $27,417,000 in damages (DG's lost profits and Grumman's nonduplicative profits) is that the district court failed to give the jury adequate guidance to find the necessary causal connection between Grumman's infringement and DG's damages.  Because the calculus of causation is partly a function of the particular theory of damages advanced by the plaintiff, we divide our discussion accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>a. Actual Damages</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A successful plaintiff in an infringement action is entitled to \"actual damages suffered by [it] as result of the infringement.\"  17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(b).  Actual damages are generally calculated with reference to the loss in the fair market value of the copyright, often measured by the profits lost as a result of the infringement.  See, e.g., Eales v. Envtl.  Lifestyles, Inc., 958 F.2d 876, 880 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 605, 121 L.Ed.2d 541 (1992);  see generally 3 Nimmer Sec. 14.02[A], at 14-8 to 14-9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the infringement was the cause of its loss of revenue.  See Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 567, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 2234, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985);  Frank Music Corp. v. MGM, Inc., 772 F.2d 505, 514 n. 8 (9th Cir.1985) (citing Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. 4636 S. Vermont Ave., Inc., 367 F.2d 236, 241 (9th Cir.1966)).  In defining that burden, it is useful to borrow familiar tort law principles of causation and damages.  See Deltak, Inc. v. Advanced Sys., Inc., 574 F.Supp. 400, 403 (N.D.Ill.1983) (Posner, J., sitting by designation) (referring to \"normal tort damages principles\" in discussion of copyright damages), vacated on other grounds, 767 F.2d 357 (7th Cir.1985);  3 Nimmer Sec. 14.02[A], at 14-11, 14-20 to 14-21 n. 49.8 (alluding to notions of \"but for\" and proximate causation).  Thus, the plaintiff should first establish that the infringement was the cause-in-fact of its loss by showing with reasonable probability that, but for the defendant's infringement, the plaintiff would not have suffered the loss.  See, e.g., Robert R. Jones Assocs. v. Nino Homes, 858 F.2d 274, 281 (6th Cir.1988);  3 Nimmer, Sec. 14.02[A], at 14-9;  cf. Harper &amp; Row, 471 U.S. at 567, 105 S.Ct. at 2234 (noting that in rebuttal defendant may \"show that this damage would have occurred [anyway] had there been no taking of copyrighted expression\");  Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 507, 84 S.Ct. 1526, 1543, 12 L.Ed.2d 457 (1964) (noting that actual damages in patent infringement case are based on \"what [the patent holder's] condition would have been if the infringement had not occurred\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The plaintiff must also prove that the infringement was a proximate cause of its loss by demonstrating that the existence and amount of the loss was a natural and probable consequence of the infringement.  See Big Seven Music Corp. v. Lennon, 554 F.2d 504, 509 (2d Cir.1977) (\"[D]amages may be recovered only if there is a necessary, immediate and direct causal connection between the wrongdoing and the damages.\").  A plaintiff may seek compensation for both direct and \"indirect\" losses, as long as the losses claimed are not unduly speculative.  See Business Trends Analysts, Inc. v. Freedonia Group, Inc., 887 F.2d 399, 404 (2d Cir.1989) (recognizing possibility of recovery for loss of \"enhanced good will\" and \"market recognition\");  Abeshouse v. Ultragraphics, Inc., 754 F.2d 467, 471 (2d Cir.1985) (ruling that claimed harm to \"reputation\" and \"marketability\" of copyrighted poster was \"too speculative to support any award of actual damages\");  Sunset Lamp Corp. v. Alsy Corp., 749 F.Supp. 520, 524-25 (S.D.N.Y.1990) (recognizing possibility of recovery for lost sales of noninfringed items);  3 Nimmer Sec. 14.02[A], at 14-11 to 14-21.  At the same time, the plaintiff need not prove its loss of revenue with mathematical precision.  See, e.g., Stevens Linen Assocs. v. Mastercraft Corp., 656 F.2d 11, 14 (2d Cir.1981) (\"In establishing lost sales due to sales of an infringing product, courts must necessarily engage in some degree of speculation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DG argued at trial that ADEX capability was essential both to service MV computers and attract customers, and therefore nearly all of Grumman's MV customers would have remained with DG (or would have switched back to DG) had Grumman not touted its possession and use of ADEX.  In opposition, Grumman introduced evidence that ADEX was of little use to Grumman's field engineers and only a minor factor in consumer's selection of a service vendor.  In effect, Grumman argued that, even without ADEX, customers would have switched to (or remained with) Grumman in order to take advantage of its lower prices and allegedly higher-quality service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its objections to the jury charge, Grumman expressed concerns about the court's instructions on causation in the lost profits context.  Grumman asked the court to instruct the jury that it was free to consider whether factors other than Grumman's infringement enabled Grumman to win customers from DG.  On appeal, Grumman continues to challenge the adequacy of the district court's instructions on causation, and raises several questions about the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>(1) Jury Instructions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's charge, relevant portions of which are set forth in the margin, invited the jury to consider the \"diverse factors\" that make up a customer's choice of a service organization, and properly allowed the jury to consider whether the majority of MV equipment owners would have turned to DG for service had Grumman not possessed and used ADEX.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a>  The instructions also introduced the jury to the concept of proximate cause.  The charge not only mentioned the concept by name but also gave it content by explaining, among other things, that the plaintiff \"bears the burden of proving its damages to a reasonable degree of certainty,\" may not be compensated for \"purely speculative\" damages, and is entitled only to \"reasonable\" damages.  We conclude that the charge adequately equipped the jury to determine whether or not DG had established the requisite causal link between Grumman's infringement and the profits DG claimed to have lost.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p>(2) Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman's challenge to the evidentiary basis for the jury's award of actual damages is less developed and equally unavailing.  Upsetting a jury's damage award is a daunting task for any appellant, for we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, upholding the award if it derives from \"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based on the evidence before the jury.\"  Anthony v. G.M.D. Airline Servs., 17 F.3d 490, 493 (1st Cir.1994) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The likelihood of a victorious appeal is especially remote in the absence of rigorous argumentation.  Cf. Chakrabarti v. Cohen, 31 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994) (suggesting that, when challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, a defendant-appellant must make a \"serious effort ... to analyze the evidence taking it in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff] and resolving credibility issues in [the plaintiff's] favor\").  Moreover, the calculation of lost profits will always involve \"some degree of speculation.\"  Stevens Linen Assocs., 656 F.2d at 14.   As a result, we rely on the appellant to specify with some precision the manner in which unduly speculative reasoning is likely to have infected the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman raises several specific concerns.  First, Grumman complains that the jury had no basis to conclude that Grumman would not be in the MV business because DG's damage expert, Alan Friedman, did not consider the relative infrequency of Grumman's use of ADEX, or the value Grumman added to its product through \"substantially lower prices, superior service and higher level of customer satisfaction.\"   Grumman's ultimate concern is that \"no attempt at apportionment was made.\"   But Friedman did not set out to show that there was nothing attractive about Grumman service apart from its possession and use of ADEX.  Instead, he reported--and the jury apparently believed--that, for most owners of MV equipment, ADEX capability was the critical attribute in a service vendor.  As a result, Friedman concluded, ADEX capability was the sine qua non of Grumman's success in its chosen niche as a national vendor of MV service.  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of DG, we conclude that a reasonable jury was free to agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman also argues that the jury must have improperly followed Friedman's lead in adding to the lost profits figure all of the service and hardware needs of Grumman's MV customers that DG was capable of filling.  Grumman notes that Friedman based his testimony on evidence that customers prefer to have a single vendor of service, but claims that this evidence deserves little weight because \"customers that had gone to [Grumman] had already demonstrated their particular price/service sensitivity.\"   Viewed in a light most favorable to the verdict, however, the record evidence adequately supports the inference that Friedman invited the jury to draw.  For example, while MV equipment owners may have switched to Grumman in search of lower prices and better service, the evidence suggests that none of them had to give up a preference for single sourcing to do so.  Indeed, the evidence suggests that Grumman's drawing power was due in part to its ability to be a single source of service, particularly for customers with multiple brands of computer equipment.  Nor did Grumman attempt to rebut Friedman's view with evidence of MV equipment owners who sacrificed their preference for single sourcing in certain circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a>  More importantly, Friedman did not presume that customers would be entirely insensitive to issues of price and quality.  In calculating DG's lost profits, he reduced the figure by an estimate of the business DG would itself have lost to competition from TPMs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a>  Finally, we note that DG did not seek compensation for a loss in \"goodwill\" or \"market recognition\" that was difficult to ascertain, cf. Business Trends, 887 F.2d at 404, but rather for the loss of a reasonably verifiable number of customers with a limited and predictable set of service needs and a demonstrated tendency to satisfy those needs by turning to a single vendor.  In short, the evidence does not suggest that the jury's award of actual damages falls outside the \" 'wide range of arguable appropriateness.' \"  Toucet v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 991 F.2d 5, 11 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 216 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p>b. Infringer's Profits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to actual damages, a copyright plaintiff may also recover the infringer's nonduplicative profits, i.e., \"any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.\"  17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(b).  In the context of infringer's profits, the plaintiff must meet only a minimal burden of proof in order to trigger a rebuttable presumption that the defendant's revenues are entirely attributable to the infringement;  the burden then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate what portion of its revenues represent profits, and what portion of its profits are not traceable to the infringement.  See id.;  Frank Music, 772 F.2d at 514;  Cream Records, Inc. v. Jos.  Schlitz Brewing Co., 754 F.2d 826, 828 (9th Cir.1985).  Specifically, Section 504(b) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>In establishing the infringer's profits, the copyright owner is required to present proof only of the infringer's gross revenue, and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DG introduced evidence that, of Grumman's gross revenue from MV-related business during the period 1984 to 1990, $5.4 million consisted of business eliminated from the calculation of DG's lost profits.  Although no further proof was required, DG accepted Grumman's estimates of its profit margin, and concluded that Grumman's nonduplicative profits amounted to approximately $1.6 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a>  Anticipating Grumman's attempt to prove the need for apportionment, DG also argued that, without ADEX, Grumman would not have been in the MV service business on a national scale, and that therefore Grumman would not have earned the remainder of its MV-related profits.  In other words, DG's theory was that because ADEX capability was generally essential to attract customers with MV computers, few such customers would have chosen Grumman as a service vendor, causing Grumman to leave (or perhaps never enter) the national market for service of MV-related equipment.  Thus, according to DG, Grumman's nonduplicative profits were the indirect result of consumer choices distorted by Grumman's infringement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether Grumman contested DG's theory on the merits, although Grumman did introduce some expert testimony that owners of MV equipment were relatively indifferent to the ADEX issue in their choice of service vendors.  As amplified by its arguments on appeal, however, Grumman's primary strategy was to invite the jury to take Grumman's infringement as a given, and focus instead on why its customers were willing to pay for Grumman service.  Grumman argued that factors other than its possession and use of ADEX contributed to its customers' willingness to pay, and that it was entitled to retain a corresponding share of the resulting profits.  Grumman introduced some evidence tending to show that its customers attached high value to the price and quality of Grumman service, as well as Grumman's ability to service non-DG equipment in a mixed-equipment system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that DG's \"but for\" theory focused on a different aspect of consumer behavior than Grumman's \"contributing factors\" theory, Grumman argued below that the court's instructions should leave the jury free to adopt either line of reasoning.  Grumman's suggested method of doing so was for the court to instruct the jury on the concept of apportionment of infringer's profits set forth in Section 504(b).  The district court agreed that the jury could adopt the approach best suited to the circumstances, but refused to give an explicit instruction on apportionment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming for the moment that Grumman was entitled to invite the jury to adopt its analytical framework, we do not believe that the court's instruction \"properly apprise[d]\" the jury of the validity of such an approach.  Joia v. Jo-Ja Serv.  Corp., 817 F.2d 908, 912 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1008, 108 S.Ct. 703, 98 L.Ed.2d 654 (1988).  Although the district court instructed the jury to include among infringer's profits only those revenues \"attributable to the infringement,\" at no point did the court fully reveal or explain the relatively difficult statutory concept of \"elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.\"  17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(b).  As noted in the preceding section, the court did refer (at least in its instruction on actual damages) to \"diverse factors\" which might have influenced customers' choice of Grumman over DG, but the court did not inform the jury that there may have been many reasons for customers' willingness to pay for Grumman service apart from the fact that Grumman possessed and used ADEX.  Cf. Walker v. Forbes, Inc., 28 F.3d 409, 416 (4th Cir.1994) (praising district court's \"rich and detailed instructions ... explaining ... the correct apportionment of profit attributable to the infringement, [and] faithfully explaining the rules and procedures set out in the statute\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear why, if the district court chose to reject Grumman's proposed instruction, it did not simply read to the jury the language of Section 504(b).  We may overlook its failure to do so only if there is no basis in law or fact for the application of Grumman's theory.  See Joia, 817 F.2d at 912 (holding that \"all parties are entitled to an adequate jury instruction upon the controlling issues\");  cf. Allen v. Chance Mfg. Co., 873 F.2d 465, 470 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that remand on basis of instructional error is required only if error \"may have unfairly affected the jury's conclusions\").  For the reasons set forth below, we believe that Grumman's theory is firmly rooted in the law of copyright and the record of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's burden under the apportionment provision of Section 504(b) is primarily to demonstrate the absence of a causal link between the infringement and all or part of the profits claimed by the plaintiff.  See Walker, 28 F.3d at 412 (describing Section 504(b) as \"a rule of causation\").  Because the rebuttable presumption of causation represents a presumption as to both cause-in-fact and proximate cause, there are two avenues of attack available to a copyright defendant.  First, the defendant can attempt to show that consumers would have purchased its product even without the infringing element.  See, e.g., id. at 413 (holding that district court properly allowed the defendant to show that an unauthorized reproduction of a photograph in an issue of its magazine had no causal relation to \"amounts of revenue ... committed to the issue sight unseen\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a>  Alternatively, the defendant may show that the existence and amount of its profits are not the natural and probable consequences of the infringement alone, but are also the result of other factors which either add intrinsic value to the product or have independent promotional value.  See, e.g., Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 309 U.S. 390, 407-08, 60 S.Ct. 681, 687-88, 84 L.Ed. 825 (1940) (approving apportionment where profits of defendant's film were largely attributable not to the plaintiff's pirated story but rather to the \"drawing power\" of the star performers and the artistry of others involved in the creation of the film);  Abend v. MCA, Inc., 863 F.2d 1465, 1480 (9th Cir.1988) (remanding for apportionment where factors other than the underlying story--particularly the talent and popularity of Alfred Hitchcock, Jimmy Stewart, and Grace Kelly--\"clearly contributed\" to the success of the film \"Rear Window\"), aff'd on other grounds, 495 U.S. 207, 110 S.Ct. 1750, 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990);  Sygma Photo News, Inc. v. High Soc'y Magazine, Inc., 778 F.2d 89, 96 (2d Cir.1985) (apportioning profits from sales of \"Celebrity Skin\" magazine where promotional cover contained not only infringing photograph of Raquel Welch but also a list of other nude celebrity photographs contained within);  Cream Records, 754 F.2d at 828-29 (upholding apportionment of profits from malt liquor sales apparently based on popularity of noninfringing product and promotional value of noninfringing elements of defendant's commercial);  cf. USM Corp., 467 N.E.2d at 1277 (trade secrets;  recognizing that apportionment would have been proper if defendant had demonstrated that factors such as \"management skill\" or \"capital investment\" had contributed to the success of its product).  Grumman apparently wished to tread the second path, and it was unquestionably entitled to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman also suggests on appeal that the jury should have been instructed that it could not accept DG's theory on the apportionment issue because DG gave little or no weight to Grumman's contributions.  But the only argument presented to the district court was that the court should add an instruction to inform the jury that it was permitted to apportion Grumman's profits.  It is usually imprudent for a court of appeals to pass on an issue not presented to the district court in the first instance, and we decline to do so in these circumstances.  See, e.g., Mariani v. Doctors Assocs., 983 F.2d 5, 8 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993) (\"We have repeatedly warned that we will not entertain arguments made for the first time on appeal.\")  (citing FDIC v. World Univ., Inc., 978 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1992));  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (\"[A] litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace.\")  (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are compelled to add, however, that an instruction on apportionment would not rob DG's theory of all possible meaning.  In the first place, DG was free to argue that Grumman's infringement was a \"but for\" cause of Grumman's nonduplicative profits, even if the court should have explained to the jury that Grumman could still satisfy its burden by demonstrating the absence of proximate causation.  In addition, DG was entitled to argue that Grumman's infringement should be viewed as the sole or overriding cause of Grumman's profits.  Cf. Frank Music, 772 F.2d at 518 (noting that \"no one element was the sole or overriding reason\" for the success of defendant's infringing \"Hallelujah Hollywood\" stage show).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, although apportionment primarily depends on questions of causation, it is ultimately a delicate exercise informed by considerations of fairness and public policy, as well as fact.  The doctrine of apportionment was \"established upon equitable principles\" in the analogous context of patent infringement.  Sheldon, 309 U.S. at 401, 60 S.Ct. at 684.   And, in adopting the principle of apportionment for copyright cases, the Court observed that \"[e]quity is concerned with making a fair apportionment so that neither party will have what justly belongs to the other.\"  Id. at 408, 60 S.Ct. at 688 (emphasis added).  See also 3 Nimmer Sec. 14.03[C], at 14-42 (noting that Copyright Act of 1976 \"expressly adopted\" the apportionment principle announced in Sheldon ).   In fact, the burden-shifting rule in Sheldon (and Section 504(b)) is itself an equitable response to an infringer who has frustrated the task of apportionment by co-mingling profits.  See Sheldon, 309 U.S. at 401, 60 S.Ct. at 685 (\"[T]he defendant, being responsible for the blending of the lawful with the unlawful, had to abide the consequences, as in the case of one who has wrongfully produced a confusion of goods.\")  (referring to Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U.S. 617, 9 S.Ct. 177, 32 L.Ed. 547 (1888)).  Equitable factors may also affect the substance of the apportionment analysis.  For example, where the plaintiff cannot prove actual damages and the defendant's profits are only from the sale of a noninfringing product, the only way to prevent unjust enrichment may be to place more weight on the profit-generating effect of an infringing sales tool used to promote that product.  See, e.g., Konor Enters. v. Eagle Publications, Inc., 878 F.2d 138, 140 (4th Cir.1989) (suggesting that defendant may not be entitled to retain any of the profits from sale of advertising space where it is \"plausible ... that all profits were a direct result\" of infringing marketing information distributed to potential advertisers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the policies underlying the Copyright Act may play some role in the apportionment of profits.  For example, Sheldon and its progeny suggest that apportionment is almost always available in the context of infringing derivative works, perhaps in part because original expression added by the infringer is itself entitled to copyright protection.  Furthermore, where the plaintiff is seeking to vindicate its right to exclude others rather than its right to collect a licensing fee, see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 106 (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992) (describing rights of copyright owner), it may be more appropriate to view the infringement as an \"overriding\" cause of the defendant's profits.  In such cases, rigid isolation of the value of the infringement to the defendant (which would approximate a \"reasonable\" licensing fee) would effectively condone a license the plaintiff never wished to grant.  Lastly, we note that an unjust enrichment theory aims to strip the defendant of its ill-gotten gains, see, e.g., 3 Nimmer Sec. 14.01[A], at 14-6, encourage compliance with the Copyright Act, see, e.g., Walker, 28 F.3d at 412 (noting that an award of infringer's profits \"makes the infringer realize that it is cheaper to buy than to steal\"), and perhaps \"compensate\" a plaintiff unable to prove actual damages, see Sheldon, 309 U.S. at 399, 60 S.Ct. at 684 (describing the goal of an award of infringer's profits as \"just compensation for the wrong\").  Therefore, apportionment of infringer's profits may be particularly appropriate where a concurrent award of actual damages significantly serves all three purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the discussion above, we hold that Grumman was entitled to an instruction on apportionment in order to allow the jury to determine whether and to what extent apportionment of its nonduplicative profits was reasonable under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a remand is necessary is a different question, but one readily resolved.  Grumman clearly introduced evidence that would have permitted a jury to find that Grumman's customers were willing to pay for Grumman service for reasons beyond its possession and use of ADEX.  Indeed, we believe that Grumman's evidence is sufficiently compelling that Grumman is entitled to some apportionment as a matter of law.  Because the absence of an explicit instruction on apportionment \"may have unfairly affected the jury's conclusions,\" Allen, 873 F.2d at 470, we remand the case to the district court for an appropriate resolution of the issue of apportionment of Grumman's nonduplicative profits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">6. Attorney's Fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it appears that an award of attorney's fees has not been quantified, see Grumman VII, 825 F.Supp. at 370 (ordering DG to resubmit its application for attorney's fees), the merits of such an award are not before this court.  Nonetheless, Grumman mounts a procedural attack that does appear to be ripe for review.  Grumman claims that (1) DG \"elected\" the state trade secrets remedy over any remedy available under the Copyright Act, and (2) since attorney's fees are only available under the Copyright Act, and not state trade secrets law, DG is not entitled to any attorney's fees.  Grumman is wrong in both respects.  DG did not simply elect state law remedies.  DG proposed a judgment form, wholly adopted by the district court, that included (1) the compensatory damages awarded by the jury,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> (2) state law statutory damages, (3) state law prejudgment interest, and (4) federal law attorney's fees.  Nor was DG required to forsake nonduplicative elements of the various federal and state law remedies.  See Foley v. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 17 (1st Cir.1991) (suggesting that, as long as the damages are \"segregated into federal and state components,\" plaintiff need not choose one body of law under which all damages will be paid);  cf. Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1343-45 (1st Cir.1988) (holding that plaintiff may not receive award based on federal and state law so as to receive double recovery for same element of relief);  Schroeder v. Lotito, 747 F.2d 801, 802 (1st Cir.1984) (per curiam) (approving judgment for state law accounting of profits and federal law attorney's fees).  Because DG has not requested a double award of attorney's fees, there was no error in the award of attorney's fees under federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

While a substantial amount of commerce is potentially involved, DG's motions for summary judgment claimed that there was no proof of any of the first three elements of a tying claim.  The district court denied DG's first motion for summary judgment but then granted its renewed motion, stating in a sparse opinion that, as in STI, there was \"no evidence which would warrant a finding of the existence of a tying agreement.\"  Grumman V, 834 F.Supp. at 485.   See also STI, 963 F.2d at 686 (\"[STI's] evidence at bottom shows nothing more than a unilateral decision by Data General to license MV/ADEX to CMOs but not to others.\").  We agree with the district court's conclusion that there is insufficient evidence of a negative tying arrangement, but believe that the allegation of a positive tie falters at an earlier step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p>a.

See also Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 40, 104 S.Ct. at 1573 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"When the economic advantages of joint packaging are substantial the package is not appropriately viewed as two products, and that should be the end of the tying inquiry.\");  Lee, 23 F.3d at 16 n. 6 (noting that there must be evidence of \"sufficient consumer demand for each individual product, and not merely as part of an integrated product 'package' \") (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Grumman has characterized the tying product in general terms as \"access to ADEX,\" Grumman actually identifies two different tying products:  ADEX service (a service) and ADEX software (a good).  With respect to the positive tie, Grumman alleges that DG will not provide ADEX service (i.e., use of ADEX by a DG service technician) to equipment owners unless they also purchase DG support services.  With respect to the negative tie, Grumman alleges that DG will not license ADEX software to equipment owners unless they agree not to purchase support services from a TPM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman has not introduced evidence that ADEX service is a product separate from other components of service.  There is no evidence that any customer has purchased, or would wish to purchase, ADEX service separately from the purchase of other components of service.  Nor is there evidence that it would be efficient for any entity to provide ADEX service separately from other components of service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the record does contain evidence that ADEX software is a product separate from support services.  It is undisputed that CMO customers wish to licenseand have licensed--ADEX software without purchasing support services from DG or a TPM.  There is also evidence that some of Grumman's customers would consider licensing ADEX from DG so that Grumman could continue to service their MV computers.  In addition, the summary judgment record would support a finding that for many years DG provided diagnostics and other service \"tools\" to computer purchasers as part of a computer equipment package, regardless whether the owner performed self-maintenance or hired DG or a TPM to maintain the computers.  In fact, there is evidence that through the early 1980s, DG provided service \"tools\"--including diagnostic software other than ADEX--directly to TPMs.  Finally, there is some evidence that other computer manufacturers (IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Wang) have licensed or sold diagnostics to those other than their service customers.  Viewed in a light most favorable to Grumman, the record reveals a genuine dispute as to whether ADEX software and support services for DG computers are distinct products for the purposes of a tying analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a>  Consequently, we may proceed to determine whether Grumman has introduced sufficient proof that DG has conditioned the licensing of ADEX to CMOs on the agreement of these customers not to purchase service from TPMs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p>b. Tying Arrangement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proof of a tying arrangement generally requires evidence that the supplier's sale of the tying product is conditioned upon the unwilling purchase of the tied product from the supplier or an unwilling promise not to purchase the tied product from any other supplier.  See, e.g., Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 12, 104 S.Ct. at 1558 (\"[T]he essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms.\");  Wells Real Estate, 850 F.2d at 814 (\"Tying arrangements involve the use of leverage over the market for one product ... to coerce purchases of a second product....\").  In the absence of an explicit tying agreement, conditioning may be inferred from evidence indicating that the supplier has actually coerced the purchase or non-purchase of another product.  See Amerinet, Inc. v. Xerox Corp., 972 F.2d 1483, 1500 (8th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1048, 122 L.Ed.2d 356 (1993);  Advanced Computer Servs., Inc. v. MAI Sys. Corp., 845 F.Supp. 356, 368 (E.D.Va.1994) (citing John H. Shenefield &amp; Irwin M. Stelzer, The Antitrust Laws:  A Primer 72 (1993) (\"In the absence of an explicit agreement requiring the purchase as a condition of the sale, courts will accept proof suggesting any kind of coercion by the seller or unwillingness to take the second product by the buyer.\"));   see also Tic-X-Press, Inc. v. Omni Promotions Co., 815 F.2d 1407, 1418 (11th Cir.1987) (\"It is well established that coercion may be established by showing that the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction as a practical matter forced the buyer into purchasing the tied product.\").  In essence, whether the conditioning is explicit or implicit, we will not consider the anti-competitive effects of a tie to be unreasonable per se unless there is evidence that the supplier of the tying product has actually used its market power to impose the condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman points to only one alleged negative tying arrangement, asserting that DG's Cooperative Maintenance Agreement (\"CMO Agreement\") contains an explicit tying condition.  The CMO Agreement indeed states that DG designed the CMO program for \"customers who perform their own maintenance\" and that one qualifying criterion for CMO status is that the customer \"[m]aintain[ ] systems which were purchased either for itself or for resale to its customers [as an official DG distributor].\"  And, although the record suggests that CMOs may still purchase DG service (and presumably TPM service) on a \"time and materials\" basis,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a> CMOs do not enter contracts with either DG or TPMs for ongoing support services.  DG and Grumman both agree that CMOs cannot allow TPMs to use copies of ADEX licensed by a CMO.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman's allegation of an illegal tie cannot go to a jury on a record so sparse.  Before turning to the principal flaw in Grumman's case, we note that these facts lend only modest support to the accusation that CMOs have actually promised not to purchase support services from TPMs.  The CMO Agreement does require that participants maintain their own computers, but nowhere does the agreement define self-maintenance status in detail or elaborate on the consequences to a CMO if it enters a service contract with a TPM.  In fact, as we have noted, there is some evidence in the record that CMOs are free to purchase support services from others without adverse consequences, at least on a \"time and materials\" basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, there is virtually no evidence that any CMO has unwillingly chosen to maintain its own computers.  Although there is some evidence that DG officials designed the CMO program in part to prevent loss of DG revenue to TPMs, there is no evidence that consumers became CMO customers for any reason other than their belief that the CMO program was a \"product\" superior to TPM service.  Indeed, while Grumman has argued tirelessly that DG service customers are forced to swallow overpriced and inferior support service, Grumman has offered no evidence that CMO customers are similarly disadvantaged.  There is not a single affidavit in the record in which a CMO customer expresses either displeasure with the CMO program or an unfulfilled desire to switch to a TPM.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a>  Nor is there any other type of evidence that DG equipment owners capable of maintaining their own equipment would be more satisfied as TPM customers than as CMO customers.  Consequently, the evidence in the record would not allow a reasonable jury to find that the CMO program is \"an inferior or overpriced product,\" Amerinet, 972 F.2d at 1501, protected from competition by DG's exploitation of its control over ADEX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, Grumman's allegation of a positive tie between ADEX service and DG support services fails in the absence of proof that these services are truly two distinct products.  Grumman's allegation of a negative tie between ADEX software and non-purchase of TPM support services fails in the absence of proof that DG coerced consumers to accept such an arrangement.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting DG's motion for summary judgment on Grumman's tying counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Monopolization</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to alleging unlawful tying, Grumman accused DG of willfully maintaining its monopoly in the aftermarket for service of DG computers in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2, which prohibits the monopolization of \"any part of the trade or commerce among the several States.\"   To survive summary judgment on its willful maintenance claim, Grumman must demonstrate a genuine dispute about the existence of two elements:  (1) DG's possession of monopoly power in the market<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a> for support services of DG computers;  and (2) DG's maintenance of that power through \"exclusionary conduct.\"  Town of Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1990) (Breyer, C.J.)  (citing, inter alia, United States v.

We label as improper that conduct which harms the competitive process and not conduct which simply harms competitors.  Id.  That process is harmed when conduct \"obstructs the achievement of competition's basic goals--lower prices, better products, and more efficient production methods.\"  Id. at 21-22.   Cf.

In contrast, exclusionary conduct does not include behavior which poses no unreasonable threat to consumer welfare but is merely a manifestation of healthy competition, an absence of competition, or a natural monopoly.  See, e.g., United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1704, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966) (holding that Section 2 punishes only \"willful acquisition or maintenance [of monopoly power] as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman's primary contention is that DG's unilateral refusal to license ADEX to anyone other than qualified self-maintainers constitutes exclusionary conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a>  Grumman also attacks as exclusionary DG's refusal to provide other service tools directly to TPMs.  We first review the principles governing the analysis of a monopolist's unilateral refusal to deal, and then discuss whether a unilateral refusal to license a copyrighted work might ever deserve to be condemned as exclusionary.  We hold below that the desire of an author to be the exclusive user of its original work is a presumptively legitimate business justification for the author's refusal to license to competitors.  We hold further that Grumman has not presented sufficient proof to rebut this presumption and thereby avert summary judgment.  In particular, we find no merit in Grumman's contention that DG acted in an exclusionary fashion in discontinuing its liberal policies allowing TPM access to diagnostic software.  Finally, we conclude that no reasonable jury could find that DG's restrictions on TPM access to other service tools amount to exclusionary conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p>a.

See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2 (referring to \"[e]very person who shall monopolize ... or combine or conspire with any other person ... to monopolize\") (emphasis added);  Moore v. Jas.  H. Matthews &amp; Co., 473 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir.1973) (observing that \"section 2 is not limited to concerted activity\").  Thus, a monopolist's unilateral refusal to deal with its competitors (as long as the refusal harms the competitive process) may constitute prima facie evidence of exclusionary conduct in the context of a Section 2 claim.  See Kodak, --- U.S. at ---- n. 32, 112 S.Ct. at 2091 n. 32 (citing Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 602-05, 105 S.Ct. 2847, 2857-59, 86 L.Ed.2d 467 (1985)).  A monopolist may nevertheless rebut such evidence by establishing a valid business justification for its conduct.  See Kodak, --- U.S. at ---- n. 32, 112 S.Ct. at 2091 n. 32 (suggesting that monopolist may rebut an inference of exclusionary conduct by establishing \"legitimate competitive reasons for the refusal\");  Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 608, 105 S.Ct. at 2860 (suggesting that sufficient evidence of harm to consumers and competitors triggers further inquiry as to whether the monopolist has \"persuade[d] the jury that its [harmful] conduct was justified by [a] normal business purpose\").  In general, a business justification is valid if it relates directly or indirectly to the enhancement of consumer welfare.  Thus, pursuit of efficiency and quality control might be legitimate competitive reasons for an otherwise exclusionary refusal to deal, while the desire to maintain a monopoly market share or thwart the entry of competitors would not.  See Kodak, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2091 (discussing the validity and sufficiency of various business justifications);  Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 608-11, 105 S.Ct. at 2860-62 (same);  see generally 7 Areeda &amp; Turner p 1504, at 377-83;  9 Areeda &amp; Turner pp 1713, 1716-17, at 148-61, 185-239.  In essence, a unilateral refusal to deal is prima facie exclusionary if there is evidence of harm to the competitive process;  a valid business justification requires proof of countervailing benefits to the competitive process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the theoretical possibility, there have been relatively few cases in which a unilateral refusal to deal has formed the basis of a successful Section 2 claim.  Several of the cases commonly cited for a supposed duty to deal were actually cases of joint conduct in which some competitors joined to frustrate others.  See Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 89 L.Ed. 2013 (1945);  United States v. Terminal R.R. Ass'n, 224 U.S. 383, 32 S.Ct. 507, 56 L.Ed. 810 (1912).  Prior to Aspen Skiing, the case that probably came closest to condemning a true unilateral refusal to deal was Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S.Ct. 1022, 35 L.Ed.2d 359 (1973), which condemned the refusal of a wholesale power supplier either to sell wholesale power to municipal systems or to \"wheel power\" when Otter Tail's retail franchises expired and local municipalities sought to supplant Otter Tail's local distributors.  The case not only involved a capital-intensive public utility facility--which could not effectively be duplicated and occupied a distinct separate market--but the Supreme Court laid considerable emphasis on \"supported\" findings in the district court \"that Otter Tail's refusals to sell at wholesale or to wheel were solely to prevent municipal power systems from eroding its monopolistic position.\"  410 U.S. at 378, 93 S.Ct. at 1030.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Aspen Skiing, the Court criticized a monopolist's unilateral refusal to deal in a very different situation, casting serious doubt on the proposition that the Court has adopted any single rule or formula for determining when a unilateral refusal to deal is unlawful.

Some time after Aspen Skiing Company (\"Ski Co.\") came into control of three of the four ski areas, Ski Co. refused to continue a joint agreement with Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.  (\"Highlands\"), the owner of the fourth area.  Id. at 592-93, 105 S.Ct. at 2852-53.   Although there was no \"essential facility\" involved, the Court found that it was exclusionary for Ski Co., as a monopolist, to refuse to continue a presumably efficient \"pattern of distribution that had originated in a competitive market and had persisted for several years.\"  Id. at 603, 105 S.Ct. at 2857.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not entirely clear whether the Court in Aspen Skiing merely intended to create a category of refusal-to-deal cases different from the essential facilities category or whether the Court was inviting the application of more general principles of antitrust analysis to unilateral refusals to deal.  We follow the parties' lead in assuming that Grumman need not tailor its argument to a preexisting \"category\" of unilateral refusals to deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p>b.

We agree that some type of presumption is in order, but reach that conclusion only after an exhaustive inquiry touching on the general character of presumptions, the role of market analysis in the copyright context, existing responses to the tension between the antitrust and patent laws, the nature of the rights extended by the copyright laws, and our duty to harmonize two conflicting statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p>(1) The Propriety of a Presumption</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with two observations.  First, DG's rule of law could be characterized as either an empirical assumption or a policy preference.  For example, if we were convinced that refusals to license a copyright always have a net positive effect on the competitive process, we might adopt a presumption to this effect in order to preclude wasteful litigation about a known fact.  On the other hand, if we were convinced that the rights enumerated in the Copyright Act should take precedence over the responsibilities set forth in the Sherman Act, regardless of the realities of the market, we might adopt a blanket rule of preference.  DG's argument contains elements of both archetypal categories of presumptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we note that the phrase \"competitive process\" may need some refinement in order to evaluate either an empirical assumption or a policy presumption concerning the desirability of unilateral refusals to license a copyright.  Antitrust law generally seeks to punish and prevent harm to consumers in particular markets, with a focus on relatively specific time periods.  See, e.g., Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 18, 104 S.Ct. at 1561 (holding that \"any inquiry into the validity of a tying arrangement must focus on the market or markets in which the two products are sold, for that is where the anticompetitive forcing has its impact\").  Thus, in determining whether conduct is exclusionary in the context of a monopolization claim, we ordinarily focus on harm to the competitive process in the relevant market and time period.  See generally 3 Areeda &amp; Turner pp 517-28, at 346-88, pp 533-36, at 406-431.  Confining the competitive process in this way assists courts in deciding particular disputes based primarily on case-specific adjudicative facts rather than generally-applicable \"legislative\" facts or assumptions.  The use and protection of copyrights also affects the \"competitive process,\" but it may not be appropriate to judge the effect of the use of a copyright by looking only at one market or one time period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now consider what appears to be an empirical proclamation from DG:  \"[T]he refusal to make one's innovation available to rivals ... is pro-competitive conduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a>  As support, DG cites Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 570-71, 86 S.Ct. at 1704, in which the Court held that willful maintenance of monopoly does not include \"growth or development as a consequence of a superior product.\"   It is not the superiority of a work that allows the author to exclude others, however, but rather the limited monopoly granted by copyright law.  Moreover, one reason why the Copyright Act fosters investment and innovation is that it may allow the author to earn monopoly profits by licensing the copyright to others or reserving the copyright for the author's exclusive use.  See Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 429, 104 S.Ct. 774, 782, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (explaining that the limited copyright monopoly \"is intended to motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a special reward\").  Thus, at least in a particular market and for a particular period of time, the Copyright Act tolerates behavior that may harm both consumers and competitors.  Cf. SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 645 F.2d 1195, 1203 (2d Cir.1981) (\"[T]he primary purpose of the antitrust laws--to preserve competition--can be frustrated, albeit temporarily, by a holder's exercise of the patent's inherent exclusionary power during its term.\"), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1016, 102 S.Ct. 1708, 72 L.Ed.2d 132 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DG does not in fact argue that consumers are better off in the short term because of the inability of TPMs to license ADEX.  Instead, DG suggests that allowing copyright owners to exclude others from the use of their works creates incentives which ultimately work to the benefit of consumers in the DG service aftermarket as well as to the benefit of consumers generally.  In other words, DG seeks to justify any immediate harm to consumers by pointing to countervailing long-term benefits.  Certainly, a monopolist's refusal to license others to use a commercially successful patented idea is likely to have more profound anti-competitive consequences than a refusal to allow others to duplicate the copyrighted expression of an unpatented idea (although such differences may become less pronounced if copyright law becomes increasingly protective of intellectual property such as computer software).  But by no means is a monopolist's refusal to license a copyright entirely \"pro-competitive\" within the ordinary economic framework of the Sherman Act.  Accordingly, it may be inappropriate to adopt an empirical assumption that simply ignores harm to the competitive process caused by a monopolist's unilateral refusal to license a copyright.  Even if it is clear that exclusive use of a copyright can have anticompetitive consequences, some type of presumption may nevertheless be appropriate as a matter of either antitrust law or copyright law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p>(2) Antitrust Law and the Accommodation of Patent Rights</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Antitrust law is somewhat instructive.  Although creation and protection of original works of authorship may be a national pastime, the Sherman Act does not explicitly exempt such activity from antitrust scrutiny and courts should be wary of creating implied exemptions.  See Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U.S. 409, 421, 106 S.Ct. 1922, 1929, 90 L.Ed.2d 413 (1986) (\"[E]xemptions from the antitrust laws are strictly construed and strongly disfavored.\");   cf. Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 92 S.Ct. 2099, 32 L.Ed.2d 728 (1972) (holding that the longstanding judicially created exemption of professional baseball from the Sherman Act is an established \"aberration\" in which Congress has acquiesced).  The Supreme Court has suggested that an otherwise reasonable yet anti-competitive use of a copyright should not \"be deemed a per se violation of the Sherman Act,\" Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 19, 99 S.Ct. 1551, 1562, 60 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979), but a monopolistic refusal to license might still violate the rule of reason, see Rural Tel. Serv.  Co. v. Feist Publications, Inc., 957 F.2d 765, 767-69 (10th Cir.)  (analyzing reasonableness of monopolist's unilateral refusal to license copyrighted telephone listings to a competing distributor of telephone directories), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 490, 121 L.Ed.2d 429 (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a>  Should an antitrust plaintiff be allowed to demonstrate the anti-competitive effects of a monopolist's unilateral refusal to grant a copyright license?   Would the monopolist then have to justify its refusal to license by introducing evidence that the protection of the copyright laws enabled the author to create a work which advances consumer welfare?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts appear to have partly settled an analogous conflict between the patent laws and the antitrust laws, treating the former as creating an implied limited exception to the latter.  In Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 377 U.S. 13, 24, 84 S.Ct. 1051, 1058, 12 L.Ed.2d 98 (1964), the Supreme Court stated that \"[t]he patent laws which give a 17-year monopoly on 'making, using, or selling the invention' are in pari materia with the antitrust laws and modify them pro tanto.\"   Similarly, we have suggested that the exercise of patent rights is a \"legitimate means\" by which a firm may maintain its monopoly power.  Barry Wright, 724 F.2d at 230.   Other courts have specifically held that a monopolist's unilateral refusal to license a patent is ordinarily not properly viewed as exclusionary conduct.  See Miller Insituform, 830 F.2d at 609 (\"A patent holder who lawfully acquires a patent cannot be held liable under Section 2 of the Sherman Act for maintaining the monopoly power he lawfully acquired by refusing to license the patent to others.\");  Westinghouse, 648 F.2d at 647 (finding no antitrust violation because \"Westinghouse has done no more than to license some of its patents and refuse to license others\");  SCM Corp., 645 F.2d at 1206 (holding that \"where a patent has been lawfully acquired, subsequent conduct permissible under the patent laws cannot trigger any liability under the antitrust laws\");  see also 3 Areeda &amp; Turner p 704, at 114 (\"The patent is itself a government grant of monopoly and is therefore an exception to usual antitrust rules.\").  This exception is inoperable if the patent was unlawfully \"acquired.\"  SCM Corp., 645 F.2d at 1208-09 (analyzing legality of Xerox's acquisition of plain-paper copier patent);  see generally 3 Areeda &amp; Turner pp 705-707, at 117-45 (discussing effect of patent acquisition, internal development of patents, and improprieties in patent procurement on applicability of antitrust laws).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"patent exception\" is largely a means of resolving conflicting rights and responsibilities, i.e., a policy presumption.  See, e.g., Miller Insituform, 830 F.2d at 609 (declaring summarily that \"[t]here is no adverse effect on competition since, as a patent monopolist, [the patent holder] had [the] exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell his invention.\")  (emphasis added).  At the same time, the exception is grounded in an empirical assumption that exposing patent activity to wider antitrust scrutiny would weaken the incentives underlying the patent system, thereby depriving consumers of beneficial products.  See, e.g., SCM Corp., 645 F.2d at 1209 (holding that imposition of antitrust liability for an arguably unreasonable refusal to license a lawfully acquired patent \"would severely trample upon the incentives provided by our patent laws and thus undermine the entire patent system\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p>(3) Copyright Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Copyright law provides further guidance.  The Copyright Act expressly grants to a copyright owner the exclusive right to distribute the protected work by \"transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.\"  17 U.S.C. Sec. 106.  Consequently, \"[t]he owner of the copyright, if [it] pleases, may refrain from vending or licensing and content [itself] with simply exercising the right to exclude others from using [its] property.\"  Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S. 123, 127, 52 S.Ct. 546, 547, 76 L.Ed. 1010 (1932).  See also Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 229, 110 S.Ct. 1750, 1764, 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990).  We may also venture to infer that, in passing the Copyright Act, Congress itself made an empirical assumption that allowing copyright holders to collect license fees and exclude others from using their works creates a system of incentives that promotes consumer welfare in the long term by encouraging investment in the creation of desirable artistic and functional works of expression.  See Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv.  Co., 499 U.S. 340, 349, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1290, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (\"The primary objective of a copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but '[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.' \")  (brackets in original) (quoting U.S. Const. art.  I. Sec. 8, cl. 8);  Sony Corp., 464 U.S. at 429, 104 S.Ct. at 782 (discussing goals and incentives of copyright protection);  Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040, 2044, 45 L.Ed.2d 84 (1975) (\"The immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an 'author's' creative labor.  But the ultimate aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.\").  We cannot require antitrust defendants to prove and reprove the merits of this legislative assumption in every case where a refusal to license a copyrighted work comes under attack.  Nevertheless, although \"nothing in the copyright statutes would prevent an author from hoarding all of his works during the term of the copyright,\" Stewart, 495 U.S. at 228-29, 110 S.Ct. at 1764 (emphasis added), the Copyright Act does not explicitly purport to limit the scope of the Sherman Act.  And, if the Copyright Act is silent on the subject generally, the silence is particularly acute in cases where a monopolist harms consumers in the monopolized market by refusing to license a copyrighted work to competitors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that Congress has not been entirely silent on the relationship between antitrust and intellectual property laws.  Congress amended the patent laws in 1988 to provide that \"[n]o patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement ... of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of [the patent owner's] refus[al] to license or use any rights to the patent.\"  35 U.S.C. Sec. 271(d) (1988).  Section 271(d) clearly prevents an infringer from using a patent misuse defense when the patent owner has unilaterally refused a license, and may even herald the prohibition of all antitrust claims and counterclaims premised on a refusal to license a patent.  See Richard Calkins, Patent Law:  The Impact of the 1988 Patent Misuse Reform Act and Noerr-Pennington Doctrine on Misuse Defenses and Antitrust Counterclaims, 38 Drake L.Rev. 192-97 (1988-89).  Nevertheless, while Section 271(d) is indicative of congressional \"policy\" on the need for antitrust law to accommodate intellectual property law, Congress did not similarly amend the Copyright Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p>(4) Harmonizing the Sherman Act and the Copyright Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since neither the Sherman Act nor the Copyright Act works a partial repeal of the other, and since implied repeals are disfavored, e.g., Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 267, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981), we must harmonize the two as best we can, id., mindful of the legislative and judicial approaches to similar conflicts created by the patent laws.  We must not lose sight of the need to preserve the economic incentives fueled by the Copyright Act, but neither may we ignore the tension between the two very different policies embodied in the Copyright Act and the Sherman Act, both designed ultimately to improve the welfare of consumers in our free market system.  Drawing on our discussion above, we hold that while exclusionary conduct can include a monopolist's unilateral refusal to license a copyright, an author's desire to exclude others from use of its copyrighted work is a presumptively valid business justification for any immediate harm to consumers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p>c.

Although there may be a genuine factual dispute about the effect on DG equipment owners of DG's refusal to license ADEX to TPMs, DG's desire to exercise its rights under the Copyright Act is a presumptively valid business justification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently sensing the uphill nature of its allegation of an exclusionary refusal to license, Grumman seeks to overcome any obstacles primarily by characterizing DG's licensing policies as a monopolist's exclusionary withdrawal of assistance within the framework of Aspen Skiing.   Citing Aspen Skiing, Grumman contends that DG's refusal to license ADEX to TPMs, in light of the fact that DG previously allowed TPMs to use DG diagnostics, is exclusionary conduct because \"[a] monopolist that has helped a market develop may not withdraw its support without legitimate business justifications.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that such a claim can overcome the presumption that a refusal to license is not exclusionary, we nevertheless hold that Aspen Skiing cannot apply to the facts of this case.  The reasoning of Aspen Skiing has little to do with the fact that defendant Ski Co. withdrew assistance upon which competitors may have relied when entering the market.  Rather, the decision turns on a comparison of the behavior of firms in a competitive market (the Aspen ski market) with a monopolist's behavior once competition has been curtailed.  The Court noted that the rich soil of competition had produced the all-mountain ticket in Aspen and other multimountain areas, justifying an \"infer[ence] that such tickets satisfy consumer demand in free competitive markets.\"  472 U.S. at 603, 105 S.Ct. at 2858.   See also Olympia Equip., 797 F.2d at 377 (suggesting that the facts in Aspen Skiing indicate that \"competition required some cooperation among competitors\" in the Aspen ski market).  Ski Co.'s decision to eliminate the ticket in later years was a sign that the weeds of monopoly had begun to take hold, to the possible detriment of consumer welfare.  Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 604, 105 S.Ct. at 2858.   Finally, after canvassing evidence of consumer preferences concerning skiing options at Aspen, the Court concluded that Ski Co.'s new policies did in fact harm consumers.  Id. at 605-607, 105 S.Ct. at 2858-2860.   In short, instead of prescribing a categorical approach, Aspen Skiing ultimately calls for an inquiry that is relatively routine in antitrust analysis:  namely, whether the monopolist's actions unjustifiably harm the competitive process by frustrating consumer preferences and erecting barriers to competition.  Cf. Olympia Equip., 797 F.2d at 379 (\"If [Aspen Skiing ] stands for any principle that goes beyond its unusual facts, it is that a monopolist may be guilty of monopolization if it refuses to cooperate with a competitor in circumstances where some cooperation is indispensable to effective competition.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman attempts to analogize this case to Aspen Skiing by focusing on the fact that DG once encouraged firms to enter the DG service aftermarket by allowing liberal access to service tools, but no longer does so.  The analytical framework of Aspen Skiing cannot function in these circumstances, however, because we are unable to view DG's market practices in both competitive and noncompetitive conditions.  While TPMs have made inroads in the market for service of DG computers, DG has always been a monopolist in that market, and competitive conditions have never prevailed.  Therefore, it would not be \"appropriate to infer\" from DG's change of heart that its former policies \"satisfy consumer demand in free competitive markets.\"  Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 603, 105 S.Ct. at 2857.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does it appear that Grumman would be able at trial to overcome the presumption on any other theory.  There is no evidence that DG acquired its ADEX copyrights in any unlawful manner;  indeed, the record suggests that DG developed all its software internally.  Cf. 3 Areeda &amp; Turner p 706, at 127-28 (arguing that although an internally developed patent may be as exclusionary as one acquired from outside a firm, labelling the former as exclusionary would \"discourage progressiveness by monopolists\").  And, while there is evidence that DG knew that developing a \"proprietary position\" in the area of diagnostic software would help to maintain its monopoly in the aftermarket for service of DG computers, there is also evidence that DG set out to create a state-of-the-art diagnostic that would help to improve the quality of DG service.  Cf. id. p 706, at 128-29 (suggesting that \"nearly all commercial research rests on a mixture of motivations\" and that a search for an overriding \"antisocial\" motivation would be unilluminating).  In fact, there is clearly some evidence that ADEX is a significant benefit to owners of DG's MV computers.  ADEX is a better product than any other diagnostic for MV computers.  The use of ADEX appears to have increased the efficiency and reduced the cost of service because technicians can locate problems more quickly and, through the use of the software's \"remote assistance\" capability, can arrive at customer sites having determined ahead of time what replacement parts are necessary.  In addition to the possibility of lower prices occasioned by such gains in efficiency, ADEX also promises to lower prices through gains in effectiveness.  For example, customers may save the cost of replacing expensive hardware components because the use of advanced diagnostics increases the possibility that technicians can locate a problem and repair the component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p>d. DG's Other Restrictive Policies</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman's other allegations of exclusionary conduct are equally devoid of merit and require no extended analysis.  It is essentially undisputed that DG will not provide spare parts, depot repair services, certain documentation, change order kits, or schematics to TPMs.  But there is no evidence of any resulting harm to DG equipment owners.  DG makes most of these items available directly to equipment owners.  Equipment owners \"may purchase ... depot repair services, rev-ups [change order kits], and spare parts directly from DG, regardless of whether their computers are serviced by DG, TPMs, or themselves.\"  Grumman II, 761 F.Supp. at 189.   We cannot presume that elimination of an intermediate seller of such items harms consumers;  indeed, consumers are likely to benefit by not having to accept TPMs' mark-up of DG prices.  Further, a direct sales policy does not act as a significant barrier to market entry by competitors offering lower prices for higher quality support services.  TPM technicians may identify broken parts for the customer to send to DG's repair depot, use the change order kits to upgrade a customer's computer, and install spare parts the customer has ordered from DG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither equipment owners nor TPMs may purchase schematics (blueprints of equipment that often contain manufacturing secrets), but Grumman has not introduced sufficient evidence that this policy constitutes exclusionary conduct.  Grumman's theory below was that DG's refusal to sell schematics to TPMs prevented TPMs from acquiring the information necessary to develop fully competitive substitutes for ADEX.  Even a monopolist, however, \"may normally keep its innovations secret from its rivals as long as it wishes.\"  Berkey Photo, Inc. v.

DG's policy might be exclusionary if DG had sought to alter its equipment (and therefore the schematics describing that equipment) in order to prevent technological advances by TPMs.  But, as the district court noted, \"Grumman ... makes no allegations that DG has in fact attempted to subvert competitors' efforts to develop and implement competing diagnostics.\"  Grumman II, 761 F.Supp. at 191.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, Grumman has not produced evidence from which a jury could find that DG engaged in exclusionary conduct by unilaterally refusing to license ADEX or sell schematics to TPMs, or by only selling other service tools directly to equipment owners.

For instance, discrepancies in the dates, filing the wrong pages, or partial pages, and similar errors, if accepted by the Copyright Office, do not impeach the validity and effect of the registration.  If the errors were intentional, however, for purposes of deceiving the Copyright Office and perpetrating a fraud, the errors invalidate the registration.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Grumman does not question the validity of the copyright registration for the last five versions of ADEX, which Grumman also admitted it copied and used.  Therefore, Grumman's argument, if persuasive, would not constitute a complete defense to the infringement action;  the real issue is the extent of infringement properly subject to suit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> With respect to ADEX Revisions 0.0, 1.0, and 2.0, DG attempted to deposit the first and last ten pages of source code (with no trade secrets blocked-out) in accordance with 37 C.F.R. Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(vii)(A)(2).  In all three instances, DG deposited the correct last ten pages but did not deposit the correct first ten pages.  Nonetheless, in the case of ADEX Revisions 1.0 and 2.0, there was only one difference between the deposited pages and the pages DG intended to deposit:  the Primary Label Block on the copyright deposit designates \"1982\" rather than \"1983\" as the copyright date.  The same error occurred in the deposit for ADEX Revision 0.0, although there were three additional errors:  two other discrepancies concerning the Primary Label Block, and one line of code missing from the deposited pages.  The district court observed that \"the Primary Label Block, which contains descriptive information about the tape, does not instruct or direct the computer.\"  Grumman VI, 825 F.Supp. at 356.   In addition, Mr. Gove, DG's expert, testified that the few errors in the deposited pages would have no bearing on the operation of the programs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> Some courts have suggested that a defendant must show that it was prejudiced by a fraudulent misstatement or omission in a registration application, see, e.g., Harris, 734 F.2d at 1335 (\"Absent intent to defraud and prejudice, inaccuracies in copyright registrations do not bar actions for infringement.\"), whereas others merely require proof that an intentional error, if discovered by the Copyright Office, would have been material to the registration decision, see, e.g., Eckes, 736 F.2d at 861-62.   Any substantive difference in these standards has no bearing on our decision today</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> Because Section 410(a) does not specify the nature of the \"examination,\" and because there is evidence that Congress intended the government to play a role in copyright registration that is much more limited than its extensive responsibilities in overseeing patent registration, the Copyright Office may have the discretion to limit its examination to the facial validity of the application and deposit.  See Midway Mfg. Co. v. Bandai-America, Inc., 546 F.Supp. 125, 143-44 (D.N.J.1982) (citing, inter alia, Donald v. Uarco Business Forms, 478 F.2d 764, 765 n. 1 (8th Cir.1973)).  Nevertheless, any such discretion resides in the Copyright Office, not the applicant, for Section 410(a) suggests that an applicant must always give the Copyright Office an opportunity to undertake an appropriate examination</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> Another objective of Section 408(b) might be to give would-be infringers notice of the extent of their civil liability.  Yet, this can hardly have been an important legislative goal because a copyright owner is free to register any time before filing suit, even after the act of infringement.  See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 408(a);  Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Dunnahoo, 637 F.2d 1338, 1342-43 (9th Cir.1981);  see also Olan Mills, Inc. v. Linn Photo Co., 23 F.3d 1345, 1349 (8th Cir.1994);  Konor Enters. v. Eagle Publications, Inc., 878 F.2d 138, 140 (4th Cir.1989).  In addition, because Congress had included a recordation requirement elsewhere in the copyright laws until 1988, see 17 U.S.C.A. Sec. 205(d) (West 1977) (providing that recordation of transfer of copyright ownership is prerequisite to infringement suit by transferee), but did not do so in the context of Section 408, we may infer that affording notice to potential infringers was not Congress's primary motivation in drafting Section 408(b).  See City of Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 1588, 1593, 128 L.Ed.2d 302 (1994) (\"It is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.\")  (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted);  United States ex rel S.

Fleet Bank, 24 F.3d 320, 329 (1st Cir.1994) (similar)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> Contrary to Grumman's vigorous assertions, this court's opinion in Unistrut Corp. v. Power, 280 F.2d 18 (1st Cir.1960), does not compel a different rule.  In that case, plaintiff claimed infringement of the 1942 edition of its catalog but apparently sought to prove unauthorized copying at trial by demonstrating the similarity of the defendant's work to the 1943 edition of plaintiff's catalog, \"which admittedly contained some, unspecified, additions.\"  Id. at 23.   Because \"there was no proof that copies of this later edition were deposited with the Copyright Office, and there was no proof that the infringed material was contained in the 1942 edition,\" we held that there was insufficient proof of infringement of the earlier edition.  Id. Unistrut is distinguishable in at least two respects.  First, our opinion in Unistrut does not suggest that the plaintiff mistakenly deposited the 1943 edition when attempting to register a copyright claim concerning the 1942 edition;  hence, Unistrut cannot serve as authority on the legal ramifications of registration errors.  Second, in this case there is evidence that sections of source code from ADEX Revisions 0.0 to 2.0 were among the pages deposited with the Copyright Office, even if other portions of the deposited material came from other computer programs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> In its brief, DG states that \"Data General collected and provided to Grumman copies of the entire source code of all of the sub-programs that were, or should have been, filed in the Copyright Office for each of the relevant revisions of MV/ADEX.\"   Grumman does not challenge this assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> If a showing of prejudice is necessary to enable a defendant to use a registration error as a defense to an infringement action, see supra note 24, Grumman has failed in this respect as well because Grumman has not shown that it was misled as to the copyrightability of ADEX Revisions 0.0 to 2.0.  It appears that Grumman has always acted in a manner consistent with the belief that each revision of ADEX contains copyrightable elements.  In these proceedings, moreover, Grumman has never seriously argued that the first three versions of ADEX are entirely devoid of original computer code, and has consistently admitted that it made identical copies of the entire contents of each version of ADEX at issue in this action.  Accordingly, we are unable to see why Grumman was disadvantaged by bearing the burden of proving that there are no copyrightable elements in the first three versions of ADEX, a task even Grumman seems to have forsworn</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> In pertinent part, Section 301(a) provides that \"all legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright ... are governed exclusively by this title.

The qualitative difference between unauthorized copying and such acts as the discovery of wrongfully acquired trade secrets and the illegal use of that knowledge may be more striking than the difference between unauthorized copying and mere participation in the breach of a confidentiality agreement.  But we cannot agree that the latter relationship is one of equivalence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> The relevant contract language appears infra, note 37</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> Grumman asserts that any ambiguity must be interpreted against DG as the drafter of the Settlement Agreement.

In any event, this interpretive presumption has no application where, as here, the record contains extrinsic evidence sufficient to discover the intention of the parties to the Settlement Agreement.

Black's Law Dictionary 829-30 (5th ed.1979).  A license can be general, with few or no restrictions, or quite limited.  The use of the word \"license\" in a contract is clearly evidence of an intent to permit use, but the absence of the word is not dispositive, as long as other contract language grants some permission to use.  Cf. 3 Nimmer Sec. 10.03[A], at 10-38 (explaining that \"[a] nonexclusive license may be granted orally, or may even be implied from conduct\") (footnotes omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn36\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36_ref\">36</a>\n        <p> DG argues that the Settlement Agreement was not intended to apply to proprietary information created by DG after settlement of the 1975 lawsuit.  We cannot agree.  The language \" 'Proprietary Information' of DGC\" strikes us as unambiguous, and unqualifiedly embraces all DG proprietary information, whether in existence in 1976 or not.  However, even if the phrase were ambiguous, an examination of the extrinsic evidence reveals that DG would still not be entitled to summary judgment on this basis because there is extrinsic evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find that the Settlement Agreement was intended to apply to information in the future</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn37\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37_ref\">37</a>\n        <p> For example, in one version of DG's On-Call Service Agreement, service customers agreed \"NOT TO DISCLOSE OR MAKE AVAILABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY THE PROPRIETARY ITEMS [installed at customer locations by DG;]  AND ...

When Judge Motz characterized Canfield's testimony as stating that proprietary maintenance tools in the hands of CSSC's customers \"were to be used ... for the customer's own computers,\" counsel for STI responded, \"I don't have a problem with that.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn41\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41_ref\">41</a>\n        <p> Our conclusion that the \"maintenance or repair\" exception was intended to be a third-party access agreement also disposes of Grumman's assertion that the Settlement Agreement somehow obligates DG to distribute its proprietary maintenance information either to Grumman's customers or directly to Grumman.  As explained above, the extrinsic evidence demonstrates that the Agreement concerns Grumman's right to gain access to proprietary information that DG distributes to equipment owners.  Nowhere does the Agreement say that DG will distribute to Grumman proprietary information DG chooses to distribute only to its own field engineers.  Further, it would be unreasonable to interpret the Agreement as providing for direct licensing of proprietary information on demand given that the Agreement did not even allow the individual parties to the Agreement (Root and Montgomery, both former DG employees) to retain or purchase any proprietary information they acquired during their employment with DG.  And finally, a mere agreement to agree to an unspecified future license would be unenforceable as a matter of contract law.  See STI, 737 F.Supp. at 339 (citing First Nat'l Bank v. Burton, Parsons &amp; Co., 57 Md.App. 437, 470 A.2d 822, 828, cert. denied, 300 Md. 90, 475 A.2d 1201 (1984))</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn42\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42_ref\">42</a>\n        <p> Note that the Lasercomb court held that a copyright misuse defense does not require proof of an antitrust violation, only proof that \"the copyright is being used in a manner violative of the public policy embodied in the grant of a copyright.\"  911 F.2d at 978</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn43\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43_ref\">43</a>\n        <p> Even if Grumman's antitrust counterclaims could survive summary judgment, Grumman would not necessarily have the privilege of interposing its counterclaims as defenses.  Lasercomb explains that copyright misuse and its ancestor, patent misuse, are equitable defenses.  See 911 F.2d at 976-77.   If copyright misuse is an equitable defense, a defendant that has itself acted inequitably may not be entitled to raise such a defense.  Cf. 3 Nimmer Sec. 13.09[B], at 13-278 to 13-279 (noting the possible propriety of denying a defense of unclean hands \"when the defendant has been guilty of conduct more unconscionable and unworthy than the plaintiff's\").  Mere infringement may not be inequitable in this context because a misuse defense would appear to sanction at least some infringement as a necessary measure of self-help.  But violation of a valid injunction against further infringement issued pursuant to a court's equitable powers would constitute blatantly inequitable behavior.  Here, the jury specifically found that Grumman violated the district court's 1988 injunction against the use of ADEX.  Grumman does not appeal that finding.  Accordingly, while Grumman may be free to pursue antitrust counterclaims, cf. Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 138-40, 88 S.Ct. 1981, 1984-85, 20 L.Ed.2d 982 (1968) (holding that doctrine of in pari delicto is not a defense to an antitrust suit), it would not necessarily be entitled to raise a defense of copyright misuse predicated on antitrust violations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn44\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44_ref\">44</a>\n        <p> In its charge, the district court stated:</p>\n        <p>If you conclude that Grumman would not have been in the business of servicing MV computers but for its possession and use of MV/ADEX, or that some or all of Grumman's customers would not have hired Grumman to maintain or repair their computers if Grumman had not infringed Data General's copyrights, then you should consider what percentage of those customers would have done business with Data General instead.</p>\n        <p>You may take into account all the diverse factors which ... might bear on the determination, including price, customer loyalty and level of customer satisfaction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn45\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45_ref\">45</a>\n        <p> Grumman's other challenges to the jury instructions are either meritless or moot.  First, Grumman claims that an apportionment instruction (the subject of the following section) would have affected the outcome of the lost profits analysis.  As we explained above, however, the district court's instructions enabled the jury to make findings about the relative role of infringing and noninfringing factors in customers' selection of Grumman over DG.  Further examination of the value added by Grumman to its own products would have been unnecessary.  Second, Grumman contends that it was impermissible for DG to calculate its lost profits based on its monopoly prices.  This argument is untimely because Grumman did not raise this issue in its objections to the jury instructions.  In any event, Grumman has not established that DG's exploitation of its monopoly is unlawful, infra, Section III.B.2., and has not provided any authority for the proposition that actual damages cannot be based on the loss of lawful monopoly profits.  Third, Grumman suggests that the damage award was inflated because the jury was improperly forbidden from considering the extent to which the 1976 Settlement Agreement authorized Grumman's use of ADEX.  However, as illustrated supra, Section III.A.3., Grumman did not present trialworthy evidence that the Settlement Agreement authorized the acquisition and use of ADEX in any meaningful sense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn46\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46_ref\">46</a>\n        <p> Such rebuttal evidence, if it existed, should have been easily within Grumman's reach.  For example, the evidence suggests that purchasers of DG equipment generally used DG service in the initial warranty period.  Thus, owners of DG equipment might periodically upgrade a portion of their equipment, and therefore there would be times when one owner will have some newly upgraded equipment still under warranty and some older equipment no longer under warranty.  Grumman could readily have introduced evidence that some of these equipment owners ignored their single-vendor preference by turning to a TPM for service of equipment not under warranty.  Similarly, it would not have been difficult for Grumman to discredit Friedman's opinion by showing that DG had a significant number of price-conscious service customers who regularly turned to other vendors when purchasing new equipment, or that customers who purchased DG service on a \"time and materials\" basis often used TPMs as well</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn47\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47_ref\">47</a>\n        <p> In estimating this \"volume loss,\" Friedman assumed that, without ADEX, Grumman would not have been among the TPMs competing for MV-related business</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn48\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48_ref\">48</a>\n        <p> Contrary to DG's unsupported assertions, a defendant in a Massachusetts trade secrets action appears to have the same right to ask for apportionment along with the same burden of proof.  Citing 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(b) as persuasive authority, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has set forth the following rule for apportionment in trade secrets cases:</p>\n        <p>Once a plaintiff demonstrates that a defendant made a profit from the sale of products produced by improper use of a trade secret, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate those costs properly to be offset against its profit and the portion of its profit attributable to factors other than the trade secret.</p>\n        <p>USM Corp. v.

Sec. 2106, we believe that remittitur would provide the most equitable and efficient means of remedying the error.  The factual record was highly developed at trial on the issue of Grumman's profits, leaving a trail adequate to allow the district court to approximate the effect of the erroneous instruction on the jury's verdict.  See 6A James Wm. Moore, et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 59.08, at 59-207 (2d ed. 1994) (explaining that if \"the effect of [an erroneous instruction] can be reasonably approximated to a definite portion of the amount of the verdict, the appellate court may condition its affirmance on the plaintiff remitting that amount of the verdict which is apparently traceable to the error below\").  Moreover, Grumman requested remittitur as an alternative remedy in its Rule 59 motion.</p>\n        <p>We are aware that the jury did not separately award actual damages and infringer's profits.  Nevertheless, the verdict is relatively close to the amount DG requested and it is extremely unlikely that the jury would not have relied primarily on one or the other of the competing expert theories.  DG requested $28,003,000 in damages, consisting of $26,364,000 in lost profits and $1,639,000 in nonduplicative profits.  The jury awarded DG a total of $27,417,000 in damages--$586,000 less than the requested amount.  As a result, DG appears to have won infringer's profits of at least $1,053,000 ($27,417,000-$26,364,000) and at most $1,639,000.  While we do not mandate this particular analysis, we are confident that the district court, with its superior understanding of the voluminous record, will be able to estimate either the relevant figures or, if necessary, the \"maximum effect\" of the error on the jury's verdict.  See id. p 59.09, at 59-207 to 59-208 (\"Even when the effect of the error cannot be allocated to a distinct portion of the verdict, remittitur may still be used if the maximum effect of the error can be established.\").</p>\n        <p>If DG were to refuse remittitur in favor of a new jury trial on the issue of apportionment of Grumman's nonduplicative profits, we hope that the parties will negotiate in good faith to settle the remanded portion of the case or at least agree to a  more expeditious procedure.  See, e.g., Sid &amp; Marty Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1175 (noting that right to jury trial extends to adjudication of claim for infringer's profits but that parties may stipulate to bench trial).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn53\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53_ref\">53</a>\n        <p> The jury awarded the same amount of compensatory damages for both the federal copyright infringement claim and the state trade secrets claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn54\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54_ref\">54</a>\n        <p> Grumman does not argue at this stage that DG violated the \"rule of reason\" and proceeds only on a \"per se \" theory.

DG claimed that Grumman had infringed DG's ADEX copyrights and misappropriated trade secrets embodied in ADEX.  A jury agreed, awarding DG $27,417,000 in damages (excluding prejudgment interest and attorney's fees).

The antitrust claims are intriguing because they present a curious conflict, namely, whether (and to what extent) the antitrust laws, in the absence of any statutory exemption, must tolerate short-term harm to the competitive process when such harm is caused by the otherwise lawful exercise of an economically potent \"monopoly\" in a copyrighted work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a careful analysis, we affirm on all but one relatively minor issue concerning the calculation of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DG and Grumman are competitors in the market for service of computers manufactured by DG, and the present litigation stems from the evolving nature of their competitive relationship.  DG not only designs and manufactures computers, but also offers a line of products and services for the maintenance and repair of DG computers.  Although DG has no more than a 5% share of the highly competitive \"primary market\" for mini-computers, DG occupies approximately 90% of the \"aftermarket\" for service of DG computers.  As a group, various \"third party maintainers\" (\"TPMs\") earn roughly 7% of the service revenues;  Grumman is the leading TPM with approximately 3% of the available service business.  The remaining equipment owners (typically large companies in the high technology industry) generally maintain their own computers and peripherals, although they occasionally need outside service on a \"time and materials\" basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Computer Service:  Outputs and Inputs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Support service for DG computers entails a variety of activities and a corresponding array of goods and services.  The principal activities are maintenance and repair of computer equipment.  Maintenance includes care of parts subject to failure as well as replacement of hardware components to bring equipment up to date.  Repair involves the diagnosis and correction of hardware failure.  Service technicians remedy equipment problems either by actually mending a malfunctioning part (e.g., reformatting a \"broken\" disk drive) or replacing the part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of these support service \"outputs\" benefit from a range of \"inputs.\"   For example, engineering change orders, along with certain documentation and parts, allow service technicians to make technological updates to computer hardware.  In order to identify the existence and location of a malfunctioning part, a service technician may use diagnostics (now increasingly sophisticated software), schematics (maps of the location and function of hardware elements), and various types of documentation, together with the technician's own experience acquired by diagnosing equipment problems.  In order to actually mend a malfunctioning part, a technician might fix the part on the spot with routine tools or sophisticated software (e.g., a software diagnostic that can reformat a disk drive), or send the part to a repair depot run either by the technician's employer or another service organization.  The repair of a malfunctioning part often requires very detailed information about the part (such as the information provided by schematics and other documentation), and may in turn require smaller replacement parts.  Finally, replacement of parts naturally requires the availability of spares.  At the core of this litigation is a dispute about Grumman's access to software diagnostics and other service \"tools\" produced by DG for use in the repair, upgrading, and maintenance of DG equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. TPM Access to Service Inputs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DG's policies concerning TPM access to DG's service tools have developed over time.

DG was suspicious of the ability of TPMs, often run and staffed by former DG technicians, to service DG computers without running afoul of DG's intellectual property rights or confidentiality agreements binding on former DG employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1975, DG converted its suspicions into legal claims, filing suit against Lloyd Root and Robert Montgomery, two of its former employees, as well as Computer Systems Support Corporation (\"CSSC\"), the TPM that Root and Montgomery had founded after leaving DG.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  DG's principal allegations were that Root and Montgomery had breached their employment agreements by taking DG information with them when they left DG, and that CSSC personnel had been making unauthorized use of DG proprietary information.  It was unclear, however, whether the proprietary items that CSSC was using were items sold or licensed to equipment owners (pursuant to agreements which arguably permitted some use by TPMs),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> or items taken directly from DG by Root and Montgomery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lacking promising proof to support its claims, DG proposed a settlement whereby CSSC would agree to return any proprietary information that Root and Montgomery unlawfully took from DG, and DG would expressly authorize CSSC (and its successors) to use DG proprietary information in the maintenance and repair of DG computers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>  CSSC accepted, and the parties signed a settlement agreement in 1976 (\"the Settlement Agreement\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Peaceful Coexistence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1976 until some point in the mid-1980s, DG affirmatively encouraged the growth of TPMs with relatively liberal policies concerning TPM access to service tools.  DG sold or licensed diagnostics directly to TPMs, and allowed TPMs to use diagnostics sold or licensed to DG equipment owners.  DG did not restrict access by TPMs to spare parts manufactured by DG or other manufacturers.  DG allowed (or at least tolerated) requests by TPMs for DG's repair depot to fix malfunctioning circuit boards, the heart of a computer's central processing unit (\"CPU\").  DG sold at least some schematics and other documentation to TPMs.  DG also sold TPMs engineering change order kits.  And finally, DG training classes were open to TPM field engineers.  Grumman suggests that DG's liberal policies were beneficial to DG because increased capacity (and perhaps competition) in the service aftermarket would be a selling point for DG equipment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Increased Restrictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1980s, DG altered its strategy.  With the goal of maximizing revenues from its service business, DG began to refuse to provide many service tools directly to TPMs.  DG would not allow TPMs to use the DG repair depot, nor would it permit TPMs to purchase schematics, documentation, \"change order\" kits, or certain spare parts.  DG no longer allowed TPM technicians to attend DG training classes.  Finally, DG developed and severely restricted the licensing of ADEX, a new software diagnostic for its MV computers.  The MV series was at once DG's most advanced computer hardware and an increasingly important source of sales and service revenue for DG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of items unavailable to TPMs directly from DG were either available to all equipment owners (even customers of TPMs) from DG, or were available to TPMs from sources other than DG.  For example, DG depot service, change order kits, and at least some documentation were available to all equipment owners.  There is also evidence that Grumman had its own repair depot and that Grumman could make use of repair depots run by other service organizations (sometimes called \"fourth party maintainers\").  Likewise, there is evidence that TPMs could purchase at least some spare parts from sources other than DG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation was different with respect to ADEX.  DG service technicians would use ADEX in performing service for DG equipment owners.  DG would also license ADEX for the exclusive use of the in-house technicians of equipment owners who perform most of their own service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  However, DG would not license ADEX to its own service customers or to the customers of TPMs.  Nor was ADEX available to TPMs from sources other than DG.  At least two other diagnostics designed to service DG's MV computers may have become available as early as 1989, but no fully functional substitute was available when this case was tried in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman found various ways to skirt DG's ADEX restrictions.  Some former DG employees, in violation of their employment agreements, brought copies of ADEX when they joined Grumman.  In addition, DG field engineers often stored copies of ADEX at the work sites of their service customers, who were bound to preserve the confidentiality of any DG proprietary information in their possession.  Although DG service customers had an obligation to return copies of ADEX to DG should they cancel their service agreement and switch to a TPM, few customers did so.  It is essentially undisputed that Grumman technicians used and duplicated copies of ADEX left behind by DG field engineers.  There is also uncontroverted evidence that Grumman actually acquired copies of ADEX in this manner in order to maintain libraries of diagnostics so that Grumman technicians could freely duplicate and use any copy of ADEX to service any of Grumman's customers with DG's MV computers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Present Litigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, DG filed suit against Grumman in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  DG patterned its suit after a similar action it brought against Service &amp; Training, Inc.  (\"STI\") in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.  See Service &amp; Training, Inc. v. Data General Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span> </span>(D.Md.1990), aff'd on other grounds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583360\"><a href=\"/opinion/583360/service-training-incorporated-robert-j-montgomery-v-data-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span> </a></span>(4th Cir.1992) (\"STI \").   STI was another TPM in the DG aftermarket and a successor to Montgomery's interest in the 1976 Settlement Agreement.  In one count, DG alleged that Grumman's use and duplication of ADEX infringed DG's ADEX copyrights, and requested injunctive relief, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 502 (1988), as well as actual damages and profits, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(b) (1988).  In another count, DG alleged that Grumman had violated Massachusetts trade secrets law by misappropriating copies of ADEX in violation of confidentiality agreements binding on former DG employees and DG service customers.  On December 29, 1988, the district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Grumman from using ADEX.  See Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., No. 88-0033-S, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">159936</span> </span>(D.Mass. Dec. 29, 1988) (\"Grumman I \").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The parties then prepared for trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Pre-Trial Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman raised a host of affirmative defenses and counterclaims, all eventually rejected by the district court in response to DG's motions for partial summary judgment.  Three of these issues play a pivotal role in Grumman's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>a. 1976 Settlement Agreement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman alleged that the 1976 Settlement Agreement authorized it (as a successor to CSSC) to \"acquire, possess, copy and use\" all DG diagnostics, including ADEX.  Liberally construed, Grumman's allegation of a right to \"copy and use\" ADEX fairly includes an allegation that Grumman has a right to copy and use DG diagnostic software in the possession of DG equipment owners.  Judge Skinner rejected the Settlement Agreement defense by adopting the reasoning of the STI courts, which had rebuffed the same arguments on a nearly identical record.  See Grumman <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">V,</span> <span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">482-83</span></span>.   In the district court decision in STI, Judge Motz analyzed the language of the Settlement Agreement, testimony from the lawyers who negotiated it, and evidence of the parties' subsequent <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">conduct.</span>  <span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">339-41</span></span>.   On the basis of this evidence, Judge Motz concluded that the Settlement Agreement did not require DG to license any proprietary information to CSSC or its customers, nor did the Settlement Agreement prevent DG from prohibiting CSSC from copying and using proprietary information in the custody of DG service customers.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>b. Antitrust Defenses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman also claimed that DG could not maintain its infringement action because DG had used its ADEX copyrights to violate Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1 and 2 (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Specifically, Grumman charged that DG misused its copyrights by (1) tying the availability of ADEX to a consumer's agreement either to purchase DG support services (a \"positive tie\") or not to purchase support services from TPMs (a \"negative tie\"), and (2) willfully maintaining its monopoly in the support services aftermarket by imposing the alleged tie-in and refusing to deal with TPMs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerning the tying claim, the district court again adopted the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit in STI, this time for the proposition that there was insufficient proof of a tying agreement to withstand summary judgment.  Grumman <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">V,</span> <span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">484-85</span></span>.   The Fourth Circuit held that there was no positive tie for two independent reasons.  First, the court noted that DG did not actually license ADEX to its service customers.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583360\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">STI,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/583360/service-training-incorporated-robert-j-montgomery-v-data-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">686-87</span></a></span>.   Second, the court held that there was not enough evidence to prove that any license to use ADEX was conditioned on the purchase of DG support services.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583360\"><a href=\"/opinion/583360/service-training-incorporated-robert-j-montgomery-v-data-general/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 687. </a></span>  The court noted that there was no explicit tying condition in any written agreement.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583360\"><a href=\"/opinion/583360/service-training-incorporated-robert-j-montgomery-v-data-general/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The court </a></span>also noted that there was insufficient evidence of unwilling purchases of DG support service so as to justify an inference of an implicit condition;  customers may simply prefer service supported by ADEX diagnostics over service that is not.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583360\"><a href=\"/opinion/583360/service-training-incorporated-robert-j-montgomery-v-data-general/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 687-88. </a></span>  The court further held that there was insufficient evidence of a negative tie because, on the record before the court, \"[t]he fact that CMOs do not purchase repair services ... is at least as consistent with the legitimate and independent business decision not to purchase unneeded services as it is with an agreement not to purchase such services.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583360\"><a href=\"/opinion/583360/service-training-incorporated-robert-j-montgomery-v-data-general/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 686.</a></span></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Skinner conducted his own exhaustive analysis of the monopolization claim, concluding that Grumman failed to \"assert[ ] any facts that would indicate that DG has engaged in any unlawful exclusionary conduct.\"  Grumman <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">192</span></span>.   The court essentially narrowed the question to whether DG's restrictive policies with respect to TPMs constitute unlawful unilateral refusals to deal, reasoning that DG's actions do not rise to the level of unlawful exclusionary conduct for several reasons.  The court agreed with Grumman that this case, like Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111483\"><a href=\"/opinion/111483/aspen-skiing-co-v-aspen-highlands-skiing-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111483\"><a href=\"/opinion/111483/aspen-skiing-co-v-aspen-highlands-skiing-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">190</span></span>.   The district court nonetheless concluded that Grumman had failed to demonstrate that DG's restrictive policies have unreasonably harmed the competitive process.  In particular, the court noted that DG's policies with respect to most service products do not prevent TPMs from competing in the service market because \"DG will sell its service products, except [ADEX and schematics], to any ultimate consumer regardless of whether [the consumer] now or later use[s] a TPM.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 191. </span>  The court also observed that \"TPMs have demonstrated the ability to develop diagnostics [without schematics], even if they are not as efficient as MV/ADEX.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  Lastly, the </span>court suggested that the Sherman Act would not compel DG to disclose its schematics, in part because such compulsory disclosure would undermine the incentives of copyright and patent laws.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 192.</span><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting Grumman's motion for reconsideration of the grant of summary judgment on the monopolization claim, the district court also directly addressed Grumman's contention that DG's refusal to license ADEX to TPMs constitutes exclusionary conduct.  The court stated that DG's refusal to license ADEX to TPMs was not exclusionary because \"DG offers to the public a license to use MV/ADEX on any computer owned by the customer,\" and therefore DG \" 'did not withhold from one member of the public a service offered to the rest[.]' \"  Grumman III, slip op. at 5 (citing Olympia Equip.

Sec. 301 (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992), preempts DG's state law action for misappropriation of trade secrets.  The district court held that DG's trade secrets claim was not preempted because DG did not simply allege conduct equivalent to the copying and use which form the basis of an infringement claim;  instead, DG's trade secrets claim was based on Grumman's acquisition of ADEX in violation of confidentiality agreements binding on former DG employees and service customers.

Trial Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stripped of its affirmative defenses, Grumman proceeded to trial.  Grumman focused its defensive energies in two areas.  Grumman attacked DG's proof of the prima facie elements of copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets, and attempted to undermine DG's broad-gauged request for compensation for lost profits and disgorgement of Grumman's MV-related profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>a. Validity of Copyright Registration</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, it became evident that DG had made several errors in registering its ADEX copyrights.  After Edward Gove, a DG official, testified that DG had deposited with the Copyright Office the correct excerpts of human-readable \"source code,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Grumman introduced evidence that there were some errors in the deposits for the first three versions of ADEX.  In rebuttal testimony, Gove confirmed that there were a number of minor, inadvertent errors in the deposits that would not affect the operation of the programs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman argued to the district court that any error in a copyright deposit renders the registration invalid, and requested that the court so instruct the jury.  The district court refused, instructing the jury instead that minor, inadvertent errors in the deposit of excerpts of computer code do not threaten the validity of the copyright registration.  As a fall-back tactic, Grumman renewed its previous request that the district court compel DG to produce the entire human-readable source code for each version of ADEX so that Grumman could more effectively cross-examine Gove about the significance of the errors.  The district court refused to do so, and later explained its discretionary decision by finding that \"Grumman had an adequate opportunity to explore the errors contained in the initial copyright deposits, to challenge Data General's explanation of those errors, and to argue these issues before the jury.\"  Grumman <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">VI,</span> <span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">352</span></span>.

Actual Damages and Profits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman argued that the jury should identify and ignore that portion of Grumman's profits which was not attributable to Grumman's use of ADEX.  To this end, Grumman introduced evidence that some of its revenues were derived from servicing DG computers that cannot or need not be serviced with ADEX, and that the value of Grumman's use of ADEX to service customers with MV computers was distinct from the value of other products and services Grumman provided to those customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, DG offered evidence that because equipment owners prefer to purchase all service from one vendor, equipment owners with both MV computers and other DG computers (\"mixed-equipment customers\") would not have purchased service from Grumman if Grumman had lacked access to ADEX.  DG also offered evidence tending to show that, even if Grumman did not always use ADEX in servicing a computer, Grumman could not have attracted and retained its MV-related business had it not been for Grumman's use of ADEX.  DG's expert witness opined that DG's damages totaled $28,003,000-$26,364,000 in DG's lost profits and $1,639,000 in nonduplicative profits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> earned by Grumman as a result of its acquisition and use of ADEX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to blunt at least part of DG's sweeping \"but for\" theory, Grumman asked the district court to instruct the jury to discount that portion of Grumman's profits which was not attributable to the infringement.  The court instructed the jury that DG could recover that portion of Grumman's profits that was \"attributable to the infringement,\" but did not elaborate on the jury's task in this regard.  Left to choose between the parties' theories, the jury apparently accepted the essence of DG's theory, though the total award of compensatory damages was $27,417,000, somewhat less than DG requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Post-Trial Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman sought relief from the judgment on a number of grounds, two of which are most relevant to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>a.

As the district court related:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>Grumman complains that the jury awarded speculative and excessive damages because it uncritically adopted the plaintiff's damage analysis in its entirety which was built on theoretically unsound and factually inaccurate assumptions.  More specifically, defendant contends that the plaintiff's damage analysis failed to identify relevant revenues, failed to apply a reasonable profit margin, and failed to apportion service profits between infringing and non-infringing activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">VI,</span> <span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Grumman argued that the court should not award attorney's fees because DG had \"elected\" only those remedies available under Massachusetts trade secrets law, which does not allow an award of attorney's fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  The district court denied the motion, finding that DG had merely sought to maximize the judgment by selecting the most generous body of law for each element of its recovery.

Grumman claims that the district court erred in entering summary judgment on its affirmative defenses, questions the propriety of certain of the district court's jury instructions, maintains that the jury's award of damages lacks evidentiary support, and insists that DG is not entitled to recover attorney's fees.

Although the reasoning of the court below may provide a useful starting point for analysis, the district court's view of the law is not binding on a court of appeals.  See Williams v. Poulos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195087\"><a href=\"/opinion/195087/williams-v-poulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 278 (1st Cir.1993) (citing Dedham Water Co. v.

Thus, we exercise our independent judgment in evaluating the legal correctness of the district court's jury instructions.  Likewise, we must reach our own conclusion as to a statute's correct construction.  See FDIC v.

We then discuss Grumman's two affirmative defenses--the 1976 Settlement Agreement defense and the \"misuse\" defense--each of which is intended to undermine both the copyright claim and the trade secrets claim.  Finally, we review Grumman's challenges to the award of actual damages, infringer's profits, and attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Validity of Copyright Registration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Registration of a work with the Copyright Office provides several benefits to a plaintiff in an infringement action.  First, although copyright protection attaches the day original expression is fixed in a tangible medium, see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 102(a) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992), and thus an infringer may be liable for infringement from that day forward, see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 408(a) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992) (providing that \"registration is not a condition of copyright protection\"), registration of the copyright is a prerequisite to suit under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 411(a) (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992).  Second, upon accepting the registrant's application, fee, and deposit of a representative copy of the work, see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 408, the Copyright Office issues a certificate of registration, which is admissible in an infringement action as \"prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate,\" 17 U.S.C. Sec. 410(c) (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  In the case of computer programs which, like ADEX, are either unpublished or published only in machine-readable form, the copyright owner must deposit \"identifying portions of the program,\" generally the first and last 25 pages of the human-readable source code.  37 C.F.R. Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(vii) (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  By questioning DG's compliance with the registration requirements, Grumman is effectively claiming that (1) DG may not claim infringement of those ADEX copyrights for which DG tendered a defective deposit;  and (2) even if DG is free to bring such claims, it is not entitled to a presumption as to the validity of the copyrights at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, Grumman's argument is that the district court erred in instructing the jury that minor, inadvertent errors in material deposited with a registration application do not affect the validity of the registration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  DG admits that there were inadvertent errors in the material deposited with the registration application for ADEX Revisions 0.0 to 2.0,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> but maintains that the errors are inconsequential.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Grumman does not quibble with DG's denial of intent, but argues in effect that any error, however minor, precludes a finding that the plaintiff complied with Section 408(b).  Alternatively, Grumman argues that an unintentional error in the deposit may still invalidate a copyright registration if the error is material.  Grumman contends further that the district court erred in refusing Grumman's request for production of the entire source code for each of the first three versions of ADEX, a decision which allegedly prejudiced Grumman's ability to demonstrate that the defects in the deposit were not minor.  We address these contentions seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>a.

Although a different rule for deposit errors might be warranted if the language and underlying purposes of the deposit requirement were of a significantly different character than that of the application requirement, we do not find that to be the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the registration application described in Section 409, as well as the deposit described in Section 408(b), are both equally mandatory components of the registration process outlined in Section 408(a).  Likewise, just as Section 409 sets forth what an application \"shall include,\" (emphasis added), Section 408(b) uses the same phrase to prescribe the contents of the deposit.  There is nothing in this language that would prevent our interpreting both the application requirements and the deposit requirements in a consistent and practical manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do the apparent purposes of the deposit requirement counsel a different result.  Although related to the deposit requirement in Section 407, which is designed to further the acquisitions policy of the Library of Congress, the deposit required by Section 408(b) serves the separate purpose of providing the Library's Copyright Office with sufficient material to identify the work in which the registrant claims a copyright.  See H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5766-70;  see also 37 C.F.R. Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(vii) (requiring deposit of \"identifying portions\" of programs that are unpublished or published only in machine-readable form).  In other words, a key purpose of the Section 408(b) deposit requirement is to prevent confusion about which work the author is attempting to register.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second apparent aim of Section 408(b) is to furnish the Copyright Office with an opportunity to assess the copyrightability of the applicant's work.  Pursuant to the Copyright Act, the Register of Copyrights must register a copyright claim and issue a registration certificate \"[w]hen, after examination, the Register ... determines that ... the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter.\"  17 U.S.C. Sec. 410(a) (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Some provisions of the copyright regulations seek to preserve the same opportunity for examination in relation to the deposit of a relatively small subset of a computer program.  In adopting regulations encouraging source code deposits for computer programs, the Copyright Office explained that \"[i]n registering all copyright claims, the Copyright Office examines the deposit to determine the existence of copyrightable authorship.\"  54 Fed.Reg. 13,173 (1989).  In order to allow the Office to continue this practice, the new regulations provide, for example, that when the applicant's deposit contains portions of the source code of an unpublished computer program with blocked-out trade secrets the deposit must still \"reveal[ ] an appreciable amount of original computer code.\"   See 37 C.F.R. Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(vii)(A)(2) (emphasis added).  On the other hand, where there are no blocked-out portions in the deposited portions of a computer program, the regulations do not specifically require that the deposit contain \"an appreciable amount of original computer code.\"   In other words, the Copyright Office seems to have assumed that in such cases the deposited pages are likely to contain sufficient elements of original expression to determine the copyrightability of the work at issue.  At any rate, it appears that Congress viewed the deposit requirement as a means of collecting information that the Copyright Office may use in resolving the question of copyrightability for the purposes of Section 410.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these objectives differs so significantly from those of the application requirement as to justify a departure from the rule governing application errors.  Quite naturally, one important function of a registration application is to identify the work in which the applicant claims a copyright.  See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 409 (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992) (requiring application to include, inter alia, title of work, dates of completion and publication, along with \"any other information ... bearing upon the ... identification of the work\").  Furthermore, like the deposit, the application also provides some evidence of copyrightability, because it must identify any preexisting work from which the author borrowed in creating a compilation or derivative work.  See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 409(9).  Indeed, the Copyright Office may often be in a better position to assess the originality of the work being registered by reviewing a list of preexisting works than by conducting a cursory inspection of the deposited material.  And yet, an inadvertent failure to identify preexisting works on an application is treated no differently from any other application error.  See, e.g., Toy <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406740\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Loft,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/406740/original-appalachian-artworks-inc-a-georgia-corporation-v-the-toy-loft/\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">828</span> </a></span>(analyzing in similar fashion failure to mention co-author and failure to mention preexisting works).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that there is no support in law or reason for a rule that penalizes immaterial, inadvertent errors in a copyright deposit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Accordingly, we find no flaw in the district court's instruction that such errors \"do not impeach the validity and effect of the registration.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>b. Material Errors in the Copyright Deposit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law is not quite as settled as to the effect of an application error that is inadvertent but nonetheless material.  No court has suggested that a registration premised in part on an unintentional material error would fail to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of Section 411(a).  At the same time, at least one court has suggested that in such instances the proper approach might be to prevent the plaintiff from exploiting the presumption of validity that ordinarily attaches to a registered copyright under Section 410(c).

Refusal to Compel Production of Source Code</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman next argues that it was unfairly deprived of an opportunity to prove that the errors in the deposits were material.  Specifically, Grumman claims that the district court abused its discretion when, during the trial, it refused to compel DG to produce roughly 40,000 pages of source code (on approximately 33,000 floppy disks) for each of the first three versions of ADEX (0.0 to 2.0).  See Geremia v. First Nat'l Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392050\"><a href=\"/opinion/392050/louis-geremia-trustee-in-bankruptcy-of-avtek-manufacturing-corp-v-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir.1981) (reviewing denial of mid-trial discovery motion for abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman renewed its unsuccessful pre-trial requests for the source code after Edward Gove, a DG witness, admitted on cross-examination that there were some discrepancies between the source code deposited with the Copyright Office and the actual source code for ADEX 0.0 to 2.0, and then explained in rebuttal testimony that those errors were minor and of no consequence to the operation of the diagnostic program as a whole.  In response to the renewed request, DG provided Grumman with those portions of the source codes for ADEX Revisions 0.0 to 2.0 necessary to conduct a character-by-character comparison of the intended deposits of source code with those portions of source code actually deposited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Nonetheless, Grumman insisted that it was entitled to the entire source code for all three versions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman apparently sought the three sets of source code because it believed that analysis of the entire source code would permit a more effective cross-examination of the DG witness about the magnitude of the discrepancies during DG's rebuttal.  It seems that Grumman had one main goal:  it believed it might be able to show that, although the discrepancies were few in number and seemingly minor in character, ADEX would not function properly if the source code deposited with the Copyright Office had been inserted into the versions of ADEX DG intended to register.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The marginal benefit to Grumman of obtaining the balance of the source code was at best highly uncertain, and all indications were that such a test would produce no compelling results.  Even if Grumman could demonstrate that inserting the errors would impair the operation of ADEX, it is extremely unlikely that this would establish the materiality of the errors.  Grumman does not allege that any of the errors, if discovered, would have led the Copyright Office to refuse registration of DG's copyright claims.  Nor does Grumman contend that the Copyright Office would have been unable to use the correct portions of the deposits to identify the works DG intended to register or make a preliminary determination concerning the copyrightability of those works.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  In contrast, DG produced evidence that production of the requested material would be an extremely cumbersome process, a point Grumman does not contest.

The district court granted DG's motion for partial summary judgment on this issue, and Grumman now appeals that decision on two alternative grounds:  (1) the Settlement Agreement unambiguously grants Grumman a license to use ADEX;  or (2) the Settlement Agreement is at least ambiguous, and conflicting extrinsic evidence about the scope of the license presents a factual dispute worthy of resolution by a jury.a.

Although DG denies that the Settlement Agreement allows Grumman to use ADEX itself, DG nonetheless admitted in its answers to Grumman's request for admissions \"that, as part of the settlement of the CSSC litigation, Data General agreed that CSSC could use Data General proprietary information that was defined in the Agreement and the nature of which was then understood by and agreed to by the parties, to maintain or repair Data General computers.\"   While the Settlement Agreement does not bear many of the traits of a traditional licensing agreement, it does grant some permission to use DG's intellectual property, at least in certain circumstances, and therefore creates some type of \"license.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>  Consequently, Grumman's defense turns on the scope of the license.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also worthy of note are undisputed facts concerning the nature of Grumman's acquisition and use of ADEX.  Grumman did not simply gain access to copies of ADEX left at the sites of former DG service customers solely for the purpose of using on-site maintenance tools to service computers at that site.  Rather, Grumman acquired copies of ADEX from former service customers in an effort to expand its own library of MV diagnostic software, which Grumman technicians freely copied and used in servicing the computers of any Grumman customer with MV equipment.  Moreover, there is no evidence that Grumman acquired ADEX from equipment owners at a time when those equipment owners were also customers of DG.  Nor is there evidence that Grumman acquired ADEX directly from DG, or from current or former CMO customers.  In addition, the record reveals that DG service customers were contractually bound both to prevent ADEX from falling into the hands of third parties such as TPMs and to return copies of ADEX to DG after the termination of the relevant service agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  Thus, Grumman acquired ADEX from those customers who no longer had lawful possession of the program and had no right to transfer it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question we must resolve is whether the \"maintenance or repair\" exception authorized Grumman both to gain access to and acquire copies of ADEX in the possession of former DG service customers despite the fact that these customers had agreed not only to prevent such third-party access but also to return copies of ADEX to DG after the termination of their service contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>c. Scope of the License</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of the Settlement Agreement does not answer our question.  Despite the fact that the exception anticipates that Grumman will \"copy or utilize\" DG proprietary information for the \"maintenance and repair of DGC equipment,\" the Settlement Agreement does not specify whether it merely refers to Grumman's right to gain access to maintenance tools it finds at a customer site (including the routine copying and use inherent in the operation of a computer program), or whether the exception somehow allows Grumman to acquire such tools for the service of DG computers at other sites.  Similarly, the Settlement Agreement contains no prescription for resolving potential conflicts between the \"maintenance or repair\" exception and provisions in DG's Service Agreement prohibiting third-party access during the term of the Agreement and retention of DG proprietary information thereafter.  Accordingly, we turn to the extrinsic evidence in the record in an attempt to resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when viewed in a light most favorable to Grumman, the record evidence makes clear that the parties to the Settlement Agreement intended the \"maintenance and repair\" exception to function as what we shall call a \"third-party access agreement,\" allowing CSSC, Grumman's predecessor in interest, to gain access to proprietary information that DG sold, licensed, or otherwise entrusted to owners of DG equipment.  For example, when called to testify in the STI litigation, Edward Canfield, CSSC's attorney at the time, used these words to describe his contemporary understanding of the \"maintenance and repair\" exception:  \"If the customer had it, [CSSC] had a right to use it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  In addition, the language of DG licensing agreements in the 1970s as well as the pleadings in the 1975 litigation strongly corroborate the view that the settlement negotiations primarily concerned CSSC's right to use proprietary information in the hands of DG equipment owners.  As late as 1976, DG licensed proprietary maintenance information to equipment owners under an agreement which specifically allowed licensees to grant access to third parties \"on LICENSEE's premises with LICENSEE's permission for purposes specifically related to LICENSEE's use of the Licensed Program.\"   Moreover, in its 1975 counterclaim, CSSC intimated that DG had begun to undermine the ability of TPMs to gain access to maintenance information in the hands of equipment owners, alleging that DG had attempted \"to prevent owners of DGC Mini-computers from having their equipment serviced and maintained by any competitor of DGC ... by restricting the use those owners make of their owner maintenance information.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also specific evidence that the parties to the Settlement Agreement were not negotiating about the ongoing transfer of proprietary information directly from DG to CSSC.  For example, during the STI trial, counsel for DG asked Canfield whether, under the Settlement Agreement, DG had an \"obligation to give [CSSC] something.\"  \"No sir,\" replied Canfield, \"Data General was not offering to give us anything.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of the \"maintenance and repair\" exception as a third-party access agreement has several ramifications.  As a provision designed to ensure access to Grumman, the exception was arguably intended to override contrary restrictions in proprietary legends and confidentiality agreements.  Indeed, there is evidence that this was the case.  A letter to Canfield from Carl Kaplan, a lawyer who represented DG in the settlement negotiations, outlined the proposed settlement, stating that improper utilization of DG proprietary information \"would be the use of that information other than as marked by DGC or without DGC's express written permission.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Kaplan added that \"[u]se of DGC proprietary information for the maintenance of DGC equipment would expressly be permitted the defendants.\"   <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  In addition, </span>Canfield's deposition testimony suggests that his primary concern was for DG to guarantee CSSC's right to use proprietary information distributed to DG equipment owners, notwithstanding future restrictions on third-party access to such information.  Thus, a jury could reasonably conclude that the Settlement Agreement allowed Grumman to gain access to information in the hands of DG equipment owners for the purpose of maintaining DG computers, even if equipment owners generally could not allow third parties access to DG proprietary information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Characterizing the exception as a third-party access agreement also means that Grumman's right to use copies of ADEX in the possession of DG equipment owners is necessarily derivative of the rights of those equipment owners.  As a consequence, Grumman only has the right to operate a customer's copy of ADEX for the benefit of that customer;  there is no basis for the proposition that Grumman can use its third-party access rights to acquire copies of ADEX for unlimited copying and use in the service of any MV computer.  Indeed, this was the import of Canfield's testimony in STI.   Referring to a CSSC customer as a \"party,\" Canfield stated that he understood the Settlement Agreement to allow \"[CSSC] to use whatever [was] on the party's equipment ... for the repair and maintenance of that party's equipment.\"  (Emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  Furthermore, to the extent that an equipment owner no longer has the right to possess copies of ADEX, as in the case of a former DG service customer, Grumman's rights as a third party are extinguished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we conclude that the Settlement Agreement merely grants Grumman the right to gain access to copies of ADEX lawfully possessed by a DG equipment owner in order to service the computers of that particular equipment owner.  Because Grumman's copying and use of ADEX does not fall within this category, the Settlement Agreement does not serve as a defense either to the infringement action or the trade secrets claims.  The district court did not err in granting partial summary judgment for DG on Grumman's Settlement Agreement defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Misuse Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman claims that DG is not entitled to enforce its copyrights or its rights under state trade secrets law because it has \"misused\" those property rights by engaging in anti-competitive behavior in violation of federal antitrust laws.  DG argues that there is no \"copyright misuse\" defense to a federal copyright infringement claim and no applicable \"unclean hands\" defense to the state claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.  Alternatively, DG argues that it did not violate the antitrust laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"copyright misuse\" defense is not without legal support.

Although DG correctly notes that the misuse in Lasercomb (conditioning a copyright license on a noncompetition agreement) is not identical to the misuse alleged in this case (tying access to ADEX to the purchase of DG service and refusing to license ADEX to TPMs), the reasoning of Lasercomb does not turn on the particular type of anti-competitive behavior alleged.  DG also suggests that the policy rationale for a copyright misuse defense is weaker than in the case of patent misuse because an exclusive right to express an idea in a particular way (a copyright) is a lesser threat to competition than an exclusive right to use the idea itself (a patent).  We acknowledge that it is often more difficult to prove an antitrust violation when the claim rests on the questionable market power associated with a copyright, but that would not be a reason to prohibit a defendant from attempting to meet its burden of proof, and would be a poor reason to refrain entirely from recognizing a copyright misuse defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, this case does not require us to decide whether the federal copyright law permits a misuse defense.

In opposition, Grumman introduced evidence that ADEX was of little use to Grumman's field engineers and only a minor factor in consumer's selection of a service vendor.  In effect, Grumman argued that, even without ADEX, customers would have switched to (or remained with) Grumman in order to take advantage of its lower prices and allegedly higher-quality service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its objections to the jury charge, Grumman expressed concerns about the court's instructions on causation in the lost profits context.

The charge not only mentioned the concept by name but also gave it content by explaining, among other things, that the plaintiff \"bears the burden of proving its damages to a reasonable degree of certainty,\" may not be compensated for \"purely speculative\" damages, and is entitled only to \"reasonable\" damages.  We conclude that the charge adequately equipped the jury to determine whether or not DG had established the requisite causal link between Grumman's infringement and the profits DG claimed to have lost.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p>(2) Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman's challenge to the evidentiary basis for the jury's award of actual damages is less developed and equally unavailing.

As a result, we rely on the appellant to specify with some precision the manner in which unduly speculative reasoning is likely to have infected the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman raises several specific concerns.  First, Grumman complains that the jury had no basis to conclude that Grumman would not be in the MV business because DG's damage expert, Alan Friedman, did not consider the relative infrequency of Grumman's use of ADEX, or the value Grumman added to its product through \"substantially lower prices, superior service and higher level of customer satisfaction.\"   Grumman's ultimate concern is that \"no attempt at apportionment was made.\"   But Friedman did not set out to show that there was nothing attractive about Grumman service apart from its possession and use of ADEX.  Instead, he reported--and the jury apparently believed--that, for most owners of MV equipment, ADEX capability was the critical attribute in a service vendor.  As a result, Friedman concluded, ADEX capability was the sine qua non of Grumman's success in its chosen niche as a national vendor of MV service.  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of DG, we conclude that a reasonable jury was free to agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman also argues that the jury must have improperly followed Friedman's lead in adding to the lost profits figure all of the service and hardware needs of Grumman's MV customers that DG was capable of filling.  Grumman notes that Friedman based his testimony on evidence that customers prefer to have a single vendor of service, but claims that this evidence deserves little weight because \"customers that had gone to [Grumman] had already demonstrated their particular price/service sensitivity.\"   Viewed in a light most favorable to the verdict, however, the record evidence adequately supports the inference that Friedman invited the jury to draw.  For example, while MV equipment owners may have switched to Grumman in search of lower prices and better service, the evidence suggests that none of them had to give up a preference for single sourcing to do so.  Indeed, the evidence suggests that Grumman's drawing power was due in part to its ability to be a single source of service, particularly for customers with multiple brands of computer equipment.  Nor did Grumman attempt to rebut Friedman's view with evidence of MV equipment owners who sacrificed their preference for single sourcing in certain circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a>  More importantly, Friedman did not presume that customers would be entirely insensitive to issues of price and quality.  In calculating DG's lost profits, he reduced the figure by an estimate of the business DG would itself have lost to competition from TPMs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a>  Finally, we note that DG did not seek compensation for a loss in \"goodwill\" or \"market recognition\" that was difficult to ascertain, cf. Business <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530542\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Trends,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/530542/business-trends-analysts-inc-v-the-freedonia-group-inc-and-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, but rather for the loss of a reasonably verifiable number of customers with a limited and predictable set of service needs and a demonstrated tendency to satisfy those needs by turning to a single vendor.  In short, the evidence does not suggest that the jury's award of actual damages falls outside the \" 'wide range of arguable appropriateness.' \"  Toucet v.

In the context of infringer's profits, the plaintiff must meet only a minimal burden of proof in order to trigger a rebuttable presumption that the defendant's revenues are entirely attributable to the infringement;  the burden then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate what portion of its revenues represent profits, and what portion of its profits are not traceable to the infringement.

Although no further proof was required, DG accepted Grumman's estimates of its profit margin, and concluded that Grumman's nonduplicative profits amounted to approximately $1.6 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a>  Anticipating Grumman's attempt to prove the need for apportionment, DG also argued that, without ADEX, Grumman would not have been in the MV service business on a national scale, and that therefore Grumman would not have earned the remainder of its MV-related profits.  In other words, DG's theory was that because ADEX capability was generally essential to attract customers with MV computers, few such customers would have chosen Grumman as a service vendor, causing Grumman to leave (or perhaps never enter) the national market for service of MV-related equipment.  Thus, according to DG, Grumman's nonduplicative profits were the indirect result of consumer choices distorted by Grumman's infringement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether Grumman contested DG's theory on the merits, although Grumman did introduce some expert testimony that owners of MV equipment were relatively indifferent to the ADEX issue in their choice of service vendors.  As amplified by its arguments on appeal, however, Grumman's primary strategy was to invite the jury to take Grumman's infringement as a given, and focus instead on why its customers were willing to pay for Grumman service.  Grumman argued that factors other than its possession and use of ADEX contributed to its customers' willingness to pay, and that it was entitled to retain a corresponding share of the resulting profits.  Grumman introduced some evidence tending to show that its customers attached high value to the price and quality of Grumman service, as well as Grumman's ability to service non-DG equipment in a mixed-equipment system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that DG's \"but for\" theory focused on a different aspect of consumer behavior than Grumman's \"contributing factors\" theory, Grumman argued below that the court's instructions should leave the jury free to adopt either line of reasoning.  Grumman's suggested method of doing so was for the court to instruct the jury on the concept of apportionment of infringer's profits set forth in Section 504(b).  The district court agreed that the jury could adopt the approach best suited to the circumstances, but refused to give an explicit instruction on apportionment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming for the moment that Grumman was entitled to invite the jury to adopt its analytical framework, we do not believe that the court's instruction \"properly apprise[d]\" the jury of the validity of such an approach.

Sec. 504(b).  As noted in the preceding section, the court did refer (at least in its instruction on actual damages) to \"diverse factors\" which might have influenced customers' choice of Grumman over DG, but the court did not inform the jury that there may have been many reasons for customers' willingness to pay for Grumman service apart from the fact that Grumman possessed and used ADEX.

Because the rebuttable presumption of causation represents a presumption as to both cause-in-fact and proximate cause, there are two avenues of attack available to a copyright defendant.  First, the defendant can attempt to show that consumers would have purchased its product even without the infringing element.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673435\"><a href=\"/opinion/673435/wesley-m-walker-jr-v-forbes-incorporated/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 413 </a></span>(holding that district court properly allowed the defendant to show that an unauthorized reproduction of a photograph in an issue of its magazine had no causal relation to \"amounts of revenue ... committed to the issue sight unseen\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a>  Alternatively, the defendant may show that the existence and amount of its profits are not the natural and probable consequences of the infringement alone, but are also the result of other factors which either add intrinsic value to the product or have independent promotional value.

In the first place, DG was free to argue that Grumman's infringement was a \"but for\" cause of Grumman's nonduplicative profits, even if the court should have explained to the jury that Grumman could still satisfy its burden by demonstrating the absence of proximate causation.  In addition, DG was entitled to argue that Grumman's infringement should be viewed as the sole or overriding cause of Grumman's profits.  Cf.

See also 3 Nimmer Sec. 14.03[C], at 14-42 (noting that Copyright Act of 1976 \"expressly adopted\" the apportionment principle announced in Sheldon ).   In fact, the burden-shifting rule in Sheldon (and Section 504(b)) is itself an equitable response to an infringer who has frustrated the task of apportionment by co-mingling profits.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103317\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sheldon,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/103317/sheldon-v-metro-goldwyn-pictures-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 60 S.Ct. at 685 (\"[T]he defendant, being responsible for the blending of the lawful with the unlawful, had to abide the consequences, as in the case of one who has wrongfully produced a confusion of goods.\")  (referring to Callaghan v. Myers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92372\"><a href=\"/opinion/92372/callaghan-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92372\"><a href=\"/opinion/92372/callaghan-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span> </a></span>(1888)).  Equitable factors may also affect the substance of the apportionment analysis.  For example, where the plaintiff cannot prove actual damages and the defendant's profits are only from the sale of a noninfringing product, the only way to prevent unjust enrichment may be to place more weight on the profit-generating effect of an infringing sales tool used to promote that product.  See, e.g., Konor Enters. v. Eagle Publications, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525306\"><a href=\"/opinion/525306/konor-enterprises-inc-dba-american-publishers-a-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 140 (4th Cir.1989) (suggesting that defendant may not be entitled to retain any of the profits from sale of advertising space where it is \"plausible ... that all profits were a direct result\" of infringing marketing information distributed to potential advertisers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the policies underlying the Copyright Act may play some role in the apportionment of profits.  For example, Sheldon and its progeny suggest that apportionment is almost always available in the context of infringing derivative works, perhaps in part because original expression added by the infringer is itself entitled to copyright protection.  Furthermore, where the plaintiff is seeking to vindicate its right to exclude others rather than its right to collect a licensing fee, see 17 U.S.C. Sec. 106 (1988 &amp; Supp.  IV 1992) (describing rights of copyright owner), it may be more appropriate to view the infringement as an \"overriding\" cause of the defendant's profits.  In such cases, rigid isolation of the value of the infringement to the defendant (which would approximate a \"reasonable\" licensing fee) would effectively condone a license the plaintiff never wished to grant.  Lastly, we note that an unjust enrichment theory aims to strip the defendant of its ill-gotten gains, see, e.g., 3 Nimmer Sec. 14.01[A], at 14-6, encourage compliance with the Copyright Act, see, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673435\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Walker,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/673435/wesley-m-walker-jr-v-forbes-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">412</span> </a></span>(noting that an award of infringer's profits \"makes the infringer realize that it is cheaper to buy than to steal\"), and perhaps \"compensate\" a plaintiff unable to prove actual damages, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103317\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Sheldon,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/103317/sheldon-v-metro-goldwyn-pictures-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 60 S.Ct. at 684 (describing the goal of an award of infringer's profits as \"just compensation for the wrong\").

Nonetheless, Grumman mounts a procedural attack that does appear to be ripe for review.  Grumman claims that (1) DG \"elected\" the state trade secrets remedy over any remedy available under the Copyright Act, and (2) since attorney's fees are only available under the Copyright Act, and not state trade secrets law, DG is not entitled to any attorney's fees.  Grumman is wrong in both respects.  DG did not simply elect state law remedies.  DG proposed a judgment form, wholly adopted by the district court, that included (1) the compensatory damages awarded by the jury,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> (2) state law statutory damages, (3) state law prejudgment interest, and (4) federal law attorney's fees.

With respect to the positive tie, Grumman alleges that DG will not provide ADEX service (i.e., use of ADEX by a DG service technician) to equipment owners unless they also purchase DG support services.  With respect to the negative tie, Grumman alleges that DG will not license ADEX software to equipment owners unless they agree not to purchase support services from a TPM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman has not introduced evidence that ADEX service is a product separate from other components of service.  There is no evidence that any customer has purchased, or would wish to purchase, ADEX service separately from the purchase of other components of service.  Nor is there evidence that it would be efficient for any entity to provide ADEX service separately from other components of service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the record does contain evidence that ADEX software is a product separate from support services.  It is undisputed that CMO customers wish to licenseand have licensed--ADEX software without purchasing support services from DG or a TPM.  There is also evidence that some of Grumman's customers would consider licensing ADEX from DG so that Grumman could continue to service their MV computers.  In addition, the summary judgment record would support a finding that for many years DG provided diagnostics and other service \"tools\" to computer purchasers as part of a computer equipment package, regardless whether the owner performed self-maintenance or hired DG or a TPM to maintain the computers.  In fact, there is evidence that through the early 1980s, DG provided service \"tools\"--including diagnostic software other than ADEX--directly to TPMs.  Finally, there is some evidence that other computer manufacturers (IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Wang) have licensed or sold diagnostics to those other than their service customers.  Viewed in a light most favorable to Grumman, the record reveals a genuine dispute as to whether ADEX software and support services for DG computers are distinct products for the purposes of a tying analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a>  Consequently, we may proceed to determine whether Grumman has introduced sufficient proof that DG has conditioned the licensing of ADEX to CMOs on the agreement of these customers not to purchase service from TPMs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p>b.

The CMO Agreement indeed states that DG designed the CMO program for \"customers who perform their own maintenance\" and that one qualifying criterion for CMO status is that the customer \"[m]aintain[ ] systems which were purchased either for itself or for resale to its customers [as an official DG distributor].\"  And, although the record suggests that CMOs may still purchase DG service (and presumably TPM service) on a \"time and materials\" basis,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a> CMOs do not enter contracts with either DG or TPMs for ongoing support services.  DG and Grumman both agree that CMOs cannot allow TPMs to use copies of ADEX licensed by a CMO.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman's allegation of an illegal tie cannot go to a jury on a record so sparse.  Before turning to the principal flaw in Grumman's case, we note that these facts lend only modest support to the accusation that CMOs have actually promised not to purchase support services from TPMs.  The CMO Agreement does require that participants maintain their own computers, but nowhere does the agreement define self-maintenance status in detail or elaborate on the consequences to a CMO if it enters a service contract with a TPM.  In fact, as we have noted, there is some evidence in the record that CMOs are free to purchase support services from others without adverse consequences, at least on a \"time and materials\" basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, there is virtually no evidence that any CMO has unwillingly chosen to maintain its own computers.  Although there is some evidence that DG officials designed the CMO program in part to prevent loss of DG revenue to TPMs, there is no evidence that consumers became CMO customers for any reason other than their belief that the CMO program was a \"product\" superior to TPM service.  Indeed, while Grumman has argued tirelessly that DG service customers are forced to swallow overpriced and inferior support service, Grumman has offered no evidence that CMO customers are similarly disadvantaged.  There is not a single affidavit in the record in which a CMO customer expresses either displeasure with the CMO program or an unfulfilled desire to switch to a TPM.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a>  Nor is there any other type of evidence that DG equipment owners capable of maintaining their own equipment would be more satisfied as TPM customers than as CMO customers.  Consequently, the evidence in the record would not allow a reasonable jury to find that the CMO program is \"an inferior or overpriced product,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589632\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Amerinet,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/589632/amerinet-inc-a-minnesota-corporation-doing-business-as-amerinetgenesis/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1501</span></a></span>, protected from competition by DG's exploitation of its control over ADEX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, Grumman's allegation of a positive tie between ADEX service and DG support services fails in the absence of proof that these services are truly two distinct products.  Grumman's allegation of a negative tie between ADEX software and non-purchase of TPM support services fails in the absence of proof that DG coerced consumers to accept such an arrangement.

We hold below that the desire of an author to be the exclusive user of its original work is a presumptively legitimate business justification for the author's refusal to license to competitors.  We hold further that Grumman has not presented sufficient proof to rebut this presumption and thereby avert summary judgment.  In particular, we find no merit in Grumman's contention that DG acted in an exclusionary fashion in discontinuing its liberal policies allowing TPM access to diagnostic software.  Finally, we conclude that no reasonable jury could find that DG's restrictions on TPM access to other service tools amount to exclusionary conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p>a.

We follow the parties' lead in assuming that Grumman need not tailor its argument to a preexisting \"category\" of unilateral refusals to deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p>b.

We agree that some type of presumption is in order, but reach that conclusion only after an exhaustive inquiry touching on the general character of presumptions, the role of market analysis in the copyright context, existing responses to the tension between the antitrust and patent laws, the nature of the rights extended by the copyright laws, and our duty to harmonize two conflicting statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p>(1) The Propriety of a Presumption</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with two observations.  First, DG's rule of law could be characterized as either an empirical assumption or a policy preference.  For example, if we were convinced that refusals to license a copyright always have a net positive effect on the competitive process, we might adopt a presumption to this effect in order to preclude wasteful litigation about a known fact.  On the other hand, if we were convinced that the rights enumerated in the Copyright Act should take precedence over the responsibilities set forth in the Sherman Act, regardless of the realities of the market, we might adopt a blanket rule of preference.  DG's argument contains elements of both archetypal categories of presumptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we note that the phrase \"competitive process\" may need some refinement in order to evaluate either an empirical assumption or a policy presumption concerning the desirability of unilateral refusals to license a copyright.  Antitrust law generally seeks to punish and prevent harm to consumers in particular markets, with a focus on relatively specific time periods.  See, e.g., Jefferson <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111139\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Parish,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111139/jefferson-parish-hospital-dist-no-2-v-hyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 104 S.Ct. at 1561 (holding that \"any inquiry into the validity of a tying arrangement must focus on the market or markets in which the two products are sold, for that is where the anticompetitive forcing has its impact\").  Thus, in determining whether conduct is exclusionary in the context of a monopolization claim, we ordinarily focus on harm to the competitive process in the relevant market and time period.  See generally 3 Areeda &amp; Turner pp 517-28, at 346-88, pp 533-36, at 406-431.  Confining the competitive process in this way assists courts in deciding particular disputes based primarily on case-specific adjudicative facts rather than generally-applicable \"legislative\" facts or assumptions.  The use and protection of copyrights also affects the \"competitive process,\" but it may not be appropriate to judge the effect of the use of a copyright by looking only at one market or one time period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now consider what appears to be an empirical proclamation from DG:  \"[T]he refusal to make one's innovation available to rivals ... is pro-competitive conduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a>  As support, DG cites <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107254\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Grinnell,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/107254/united-states-v-grinnell-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">570-71</span></a></span>, 86 S.Ct. at 1704, in which the Court held that willful maintenance of monopoly does not include \"growth or development as a consequence of a superior product.\"   It is not the superiority of a work that allows the author to exclude others, however, but rather the limited monopoly granted by copyright law.  Moreover, one reason why the Copyright Act fosters investment and innovation is that it may allow the author to earn monopoly profits by licensing the copyright to others or reserving the copyright for the author's exclusive use.  See Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 429, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, at least in a particular market and for a particular period of time, the Copyright Act tolerates behavior that may harm both consumers and competitors.  Cf. SCM Corp. v.

Instead, DG suggests that allowing copyright owners to exclude others from the use of their works creates incentives which ultimately work to the benefit of consumers in the DG service aftermarket as well as to the benefit of consumers generally.  In other words, DG seeks to justify any immediate harm to consumers by pointing to countervailing long-term benefits.  Certainly, a monopolist's refusal to license others to use a commercially successful patented idea is likely to have more profound anti-competitive consequences than a refusal to allow others to duplicate the copyrighted expression of an unpatented idea (although such differences may become less pronounced if copyright law becomes increasingly protective of intellectual property such as computer software).  But by no means is a monopolist's refusal to license a copyright entirely \"pro-competitive\" within the ordinary economic framework of the Sherman Act.  Accordingly, it may be inappropriate to adopt an empirical assumption that simply ignores harm to the competitive process caused by a monopolist's unilateral refusal to license a copyright.  Even if it is clear that exclusive use of a copyright can have anticompetitive consequences, some type of presumption may nevertheless be appropriate as a matter of either antitrust law or copyright law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p>(2) Antitrust Law and the Accommodation of Patent Rights</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Antitrust law is somewhat instructive.

Congress amended the patent laws in 1988 to provide that \"[n]o patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement ... of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of [the patent owner's] refus[al] to license or use any rights to the patent.\"  35 U.S.C. Sec. 271(d) (1988).  Section 271(d) clearly prevents an infringer from using a patent misuse defense when the patent owner has unilaterally refused a license, and may even herald the prohibition of all antitrust claims and counterclaims premised on a refusal to license a patent.  See Richard Calkins, Patent Law:  The Impact of the 1988 Patent Misuse Reform Act and Noerr-Pennington Doctrine on Misuse Defenses and Antitrust Counterclaims, 38 Drake L.Rev. 192-97 (1988-89).  Nevertheless, while Section 271(d) is indicative of congressional \"policy\" on the need for antitrust law to accommodate intellectual property law, Congress did not similarly amend the Copyright Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p>(4) Harmonizing the Sherman Act and the Copyright Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since neither the Sherman Act nor the Copyright Act works a partial repeal of the other, and since implied repeals are disfavored, e.g., Watt v.

We must not lose sight of the need to preserve the economic incentives fueled by the Copyright Act, but neither may we ignore the tension between the two very different policies embodied in the Copyright Act and the Sherman Act, both designed ultimately to improve the welfare of consumers in our free market system.  Drawing on our discussion above, we hold that while exclusionary conduct can include a monopolist's unilateral refusal to license a copyright, an author's desire to exclude others from use of its copyrighted work is a presumptively valid business justification for any immediate harm to consumers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p>c.

Although there may be a genuine factual dispute about the effect on DG equipment owners of DG's refusal to license ADEX to TPMs, DG's desire to exercise its rights under the Copyright Act is a presumptively valid business justification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently sensing the uphill nature of its allegation of an exclusionary refusal to license, Grumman seeks to overcome any obstacles primarily by characterizing DG's licensing policies as a monopolist's exclusionary withdrawal of assistance within the framework of Aspen Skiing.   Citing Aspen Skiing, Grumman contends that DG's refusal to license ADEX to TPMs, in light of the fact that DG previously allowed TPMs to use DG diagnostics, is exclusionary conduct because \"[a] monopolist that has helped a market develop may not withdraw its support without legitimate business justifications.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that such a claim can overcome the presumption that a refusal to license is not exclusionary, we nevertheless hold that Aspen Skiing cannot apply to the facts of this case.  The reasoning of Aspen Skiing has little to do with the fact that defendant Ski Co. withdrew assistance upon which competitors may have relied when entering the market.  Rather, the decision turns on a comparison of the behavior of firms in a competitive market (the Aspen ski market) with a monopolist's behavior once competition has been curtailed.  The Court noted that the rich soil of competition had produced the all-mountain ticket in Aspen and other multimountain areas, justifying an \"infer[ence] that such tickets satisfy consumer demand in free competitive <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111483\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">markets.\"</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/111483/aspen-skiing-co-v-aspen-highlands-skiing-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 105 S.Ct. at 2858.

Finally, after canvassing evidence of consumer preferences concerning skiing options at Aspen, the Court concluded that Ski Co.'s new policies did in fact harm consumers.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 605-607, </span>105 S.Ct. at 2858-2860.   In short, instead of prescribing a categorical approach, Aspen Skiing ultimately calls for an inquiry that is relatively routine in antitrust analysis:  namely, whether the monopolist's actions unjustifiably harm the competitive process by frustrating consumer preferences and erecting barriers to competition.  Cf. Olympia <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474253\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Equip.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/474253/olympia-equipment-leasing-company-alfco-telecommunications-company-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">379</span> </a></span>(\"If [Aspen Skiing ] stands for any principle that goes beyond its unusual facts, it is that a monopolist may be guilty of monopolization if it refuses to cooperate with a competitor in circumstances where some cooperation is indispensable to effective competition.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grumman attempts to analogize this case to Aspen Skiing by focusing on the fact that DG once encouraged firms to enter the DG service aftermarket by allowing liberal access to service tools, but no longer does so.  The analytical framework of Aspen Skiing cannot function in these circumstances, however, because we are unable to view DG's market practices in both competitive and noncompetitive conditions.  While TPMs have made inroads in the market for service of DG computers, DG has always been a monopolist in that market, and competitive conditions have never prevailed.  Therefore, it would not be \"appropriate to infer\" from DG's change of heart that its former policies \"satisfy consumer demand in free competitive markets.\"  Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">603,</span> <span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is no evidence that DG acquired its ADEX copyrights in any unlawful manner;  indeed, the record suggests that DG developed all its software internally.  Cf. 3 Areeda &amp; Turner p 706, at 127-28 (arguing that although an internally developed patent may be as exclusionary as one acquired from outside a firm, labelling the former as exclusionary would \"discourage progressiveness by monopolists\").  And, while there is evidence that DG knew that developing a \"proprietary position\" in the area of diagnostic software would help to maintain its monopoly in the aftermarket for service of DG computers, there is also evidence that DG set out to create a state-of-the-art diagnostic that would help to improve the quality of DG service.  Cf. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> p 706, </span>at 128-29 (suggesting that \"nearly all commercial research rests on a mixture of motivations\" and that a search for an overriding \"antisocial\" motivation would be unilluminating).  In fact, there is clearly some evidence that ADEX is a significant benefit to owners of DG's MV computers.  ADEX is a better product than any other diagnostic for MV computers.  The use of ADEX appears to have increased the efficiency and reduced the cost of service because technicians can locate problems more quickly and, through the use of the software's \"remote assistance\" capability, can arrive at customer sites having determined ahead of time what replacement parts are necessary.  In addition to the possibility of lower prices occasioned by such gains in efficiency, ADEX also promises to lower prices through gains in effectiveness.  For example, customers may save the cost of replacing expensive hardware components because the use of advanced diagnostics increases the possibility that technicians can locate a problem and repair the component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p>d.

It is essentially undisputed that DG will not provide spare parts, depot repair services, certain documentation, change order kits, or schematics to TPMs.  But there is no evidence of any resulting harm to DG equipment owners.  DG makes most of these items available directly to equipment owners.  Equipment owners \"may purchase ... depot repair services, rev-ups [change order kits], and spare parts directly from DG, regardless of whether their computers are serviced by DG, TPMs, or themselves.\"  Grumman <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">189</span></span>.   We cannot presume that elimination of an intermediate seller of such items harms consumers;  indeed, consumers are likely to benefit by not having to accept TPMs' mark-up of DG prices.  Further, a direct sales policy does not act as a significant barrier to market entry by competitors offering lower prices for higher quality support services.  TPM technicians may identify broken parts for the customer to send to DG's repair depot, use the change order kits to upgrade a customer's computer, and install spare parts the customer has ordered from DG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither equipment owners nor TPMs may purchase schematics (blueprints of equipment that often contain manufacturing secrets), but Grumman has not introduced sufficient evidence that this policy constitutes exclusionary conduct.  Grumman's theory below was that DG's refusal to sell schematics to TPMs prevented TPMs from acquiring the information necessary to develop fully competitive substitutes for ADEX.

DG's policy might be exclusionary if DG had sought to alter its equipment (and therefore the schematics describing that equipment) in order to prevent technological advances by TPMs.  But, as the district court noted, \"Grumman ... makes no allegations that DG has in fact attempted to subvert competitors' efforts to develop and implement competing diagnostics.\"  Grumman <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">II,</span> <span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In that case, plaintiff claimed infringement of the 1942 edition of its catalog but apparently sought to prove unauthorized copying at trial by demonstrating the similarity of the defendant's work to the 1943 edition of plaintiff's catalog, \"which admittedly contained some, unspecified, additions.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"251374\"><a href=\"/opinion/251374/unistrut-corporation-v-james-f-power-james-f-power-v-unistrut/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 23. </a></span>  Because \"there was no proof that copies of this later edition were deposited with the Copyright Office, and there was no proof that the infringed material was contained in the 1942 edition,\" we held that there was insufficient proof of infringement of the earlier edition.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"251374\"><a href=\"/opinion/251374/unistrut-corporation-v-james-f-power-james-f-power-v-unistrut/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Unistrut is </a></span>distinguishable in at least two respects.  First, our opinion in Unistrut does not suggest that the plaintiff mistakenly deposited the 1943 edition when attempting to register a copyright claim concerning the 1942 edition;  hence, Unistrut cannot serve as authority on the legal ramifications of registration errors.  Second, in this case there is evidence that sections of source code from ADEX Revisions 0.0 to 2.0 were among the pages deposited with the Copyright Office, even if other portions of the deposited material came from other computer programs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> In its brief, DG states that \"Data General collected and provided to Grumman copies of the entire source code of all of the sub-programs that were, or should have been, filed in the Copyright Office for each of the relevant revisions of MV/ADEX.\"   Grumman does not challenge this assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> If a showing of prejudice is necessary to enable a defendant to use a registration error as a defense to an infringement action, see supra note 24, Grumman has failed in this respect as well because Grumman has not shown that it was misled as to the copyrightability of ADEX Revisions 0.0 to 2.0.  It appears that Grumman has always acted in a manner consistent with the belief that each revision of ADEX contains copyrightable elements.  In these proceedings, moreover, Grumman has never seriously argued that the first three versions of ADEX are entirely devoid of original computer code, and has consistently admitted that it made identical copies of the entire contents of each version of ADEX at issue in this action.  Accordingly, we are unable to see why Grumman was disadvantaged by bearing the burden of proving that there are no copyrightable elements in the first three versions of ADEX, a task even Grumman seems to have forsworn</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> In pertinent part, Section 301(a) provides that \"all legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright ... are governed exclusively by this title.

Black's Law Dictionary 829-30 (5th ed.1979).  A license can be general, with few or no restrictions, or quite limited.  The use of the word \"license\" in a contract is clearly evidence of an intent to permit use, but the absence of the word is not dispositive, as long as other contract language grants some permission to use.  Cf. 3 Nimmer Sec. 10.03[A], at 10-38 (explaining that \"[a] nonexclusive license may be granted orally, or may even be implied from conduct\") (footnotes omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn36\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36_ref\">36</a>\n        <p> DG argues that the Settlement Agreement was not intended to apply to proprietary information created by DG after settlement of the 1975 lawsuit.  We cannot agree.  The language \" 'Proprietary Information' of DGC\" strikes us as unambiguous, and unqualifiedly embraces all DG proprietary information, whether in existence in 1976 or not.  However, even if the phrase were ambiguous, an examination of the extrinsic evidence reveals that DG would still not be entitled to summary judgment on this basis because there is extrinsic evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find that the Settlement Agreement was intended to apply to information in the future</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn37\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37_ref\">37</a>\n        <p> For example, in one version of DG's On-Call Service Agreement, service customers agreed \"NOT TO DISCLOSE OR MAKE AVAILABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY THE PROPRIETARY ITEMS [installed at customer locations by DG;]  AND ...

When Judge Motz characterized Canfield's testimony as stating that proprietary maintenance tools in the hands of CSSC's customers \"were to be used ... for the customer's own computers,\" counsel for STI responded, \"I don't have a problem with that.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn41\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41_ref\">41</a>\n        <p> Our conclusion that the \"maintenance or repair\" exception was intended to be a third-party access agreement also disposes of Grumman's assertion that the Settlement Agreement somehow obligates DG to distribute its proprietary maintenance information either to Grumman's customers or directly to Grumman.  As explained above, the extrinsic evidence demonstrates that the Agreement concerns Grumman's right to gain access to proprietary information that DG distributes to equipment owners.  Nowhere does the Agreement say that DG will distribute to Grumman proprietary information DG chooses to distribute only to its own field engineers.  Further, it would be unreasonable to interpret the Agreement as providing for direct licensing of proprietary information on demand given that the Agreement did not even allow the individual parties to the Agreement (Root and Montgomery, both former DG employees) to retain or purchase any proprietary information they acquired during their employment with DG.  And finally, a mere agreement to agree to an unspecified future license would be unenforceable as a matter of contract law.

If copyright misuse is an equitable defense, a defendant that has itself acted inequitably may not be entitled to raise such a defense.  Cf. 3 Nimmer Sec. 13.09[B], at 13-278 to 13-279 (noting the possible propriety of denying a defense of unclean hands \"when the defendant has been guilty of conduct more unconscionable and unworthy than the plaintiff's\").  Mere infringement may not be inequitable in this context because a misuse defense would appear to sanction at least some infringement as a necessary measure of self-help.  But violation of a valid injunction against further infringement issued pursuant to a court's equitable powers would constitute blatantly inequitable behavior.  Here, the jury specifically found that Grumman violated the district court's 1988 injunction against the use of ADEX.  Grumman does not appeal that finding.  Accordingly, while Grumman may be free to pursue antitrust counterclaims, cf. Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107732\"><a href=\"/opinion/107732/perma-mufflers-v-intl-parts-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 138-40, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107732\"><a href=\"/opinion/107732/perma-mufflers-v-intl-parts-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, Grumman claims that an apportionment instruction (the subject of the following section) would have affected the outcome of the lost profits analysis.  As we explained above, however, the district court's instructions enabled the jury to make findings about the relative role of infringing and noninfringing factors in customers' selection of Grumman over DG.  Further examination of the value added by Grumman to its own products would have been unnecessary.  Second, Grumman contends that it was impermissible for DG to calculate its lost profits based on its monopoly prices.  This argument is untimely because Grumman did not raise this issue in its objections to the jury instructions.  In any event, Grumman has not established that DG's exploitation of its monopoly is unlawful, infra, Section III.B.2., and has not provided any authority for the proposition that actual damages cannot be based on the loss of lawful monopoly profits.  Third, Grumman suggests that the damage award was inflated because the jury was improperly forbidden from considering the extent to which the 1976 Settlement Agreement authorized Grumman's use of ADEX.  However, as <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">illustrated</span> supra</span>, Section III.A.3., Grumman did not present trialworthy evidence that the Settlement Agreement authorized the acquisition and use of ADEX in any meaningful sense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn46\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46_ref\">46</a>\n        <p> Such rebuttal evidence, if it existed, should have been easily within Grumman's reach.  For example, the evidence suggests that purchasers of DG equipment generally used DG service in the initial warranty period.  Thus, owners of DG equipment might periodically upgrade a portion of their equipment, and therefore there would be times when one owner will have some newly upgraded equipment still under warranty and some older equipment no longer under warranty.  Grumman could readily have introduced evidence that some of these equipment owners ignored their single-vendor preference by turning to a TPM for service of equipment not under warranty.  Similarly, it would not have been difficult for Grumman to discredit Friedman's opinion by showing that DG had a significant number of price-conscious service customers who regularly turned to other vendors when purchasing new equipment, or that customers who purchased DG service on a \"time and materials\" basis often used TPMs as well</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn47\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47_ref\">47</a>\n        <p> In estimating this \"volume loss,\" Friedman assumed that, without ADEX, Grumman would not have been among the TPMs competing for MV-related business</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn48\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48_ref\">48</a>\n        <p> Contrary to DG's unsupported assertions, a defendant in a Massachusetts trade secrets action appears to have the same right to ask for apportionment along with the same burden of proof.  Citing 17 U.S.C. Sec. 504(b) as persuasive authority, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has set forth the following rule for apportionment in trade secrets cases:</p>\n        <p>Once a plaintiff demonstrates that a defendant made a profit from the sale of products produced by improper use of a trade secret, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate those costs properly to be offset against its profit and the portion of its profit attributable to factors other than the trade secret.</p>\n        <p>USM Corp. v.

Sec. 2106, we believe that remittitur would provide the most equitable and efficient means of remedying the error.  The factual record was highly developed at trial on the issue of Grumman's profits, leaving a trail adequate to allow the district court to approximate the effect of the erroneous instruction on the jury's verdict.  See 6A James Wm. Moore, et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 59.08, at 59-207 (2d ed. 1994) (explaining that if \"the effect of [an erroneous instruction] can be reasonably approximated to a definite portion of the amount of the verdict, the appellate court may condition its affirmance on the plaintiff remitting that amount of the verdict which is apparently traceable to the error below\").  Moreover, Grumman requested remittitur as an alternative remedy in its Rule 59 motion.</p>\n        <p>We are aware that the jury did not separately award actual damages and infringer's profits.  Nevertheless, the verdict is relatively close to the amount DG requested and it is extremely unlikely that the jury would not have relied primarily on one or the other of the competing expert theories.  DG requested $28,003,000 in damages, consisting of $26,364,000 in lost profits and $1,639,000 in nonduplicative profits.  The jury awarded DG a total of $27,417,000 in damages--$586,000 less than the requested amount.  As a result, DG appears to have won infringer's profits of at least $1,053,000 ($27,417,000-$26,364,000) and at most $1,639,000.  While we do not mandate this particular analysis, we are confident that the district court, with its superior understanding of the voluminous record, will be able to estimate either the relevant figures or, if necessary, the \"maximum effect\" of the error on the jury's verdict.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349388\"><a href=\"/opinion/349388/sid-marty-krofft-television-productions-inc-and-sid-marty-krofft/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> p 59.09, </a></span>at 59-207 to 59-208 (\"Even when the effect of the error cannot be allocated to a distinct portion of the verdict, remittitur may still be used if the maximum effect of the error can be established.\").</p>\n        <p>If DG were to refuse remittitur in favor of a new jury trial on the issue of apportionment of Grumman's nonduplicative profits, we hope that the parties will negotiate in good faith to settle the remanded portion of the case or at least agree to a  more expeditious procedure.

Accordingly, and in view of our disposition of this case on other grounds, we need not consider this issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn60\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60_ref\">60</a>\n        <p> We note, however, that the record does contain evidence of DG's monopoly power in the assumed service aftermarket for DG computers.  In addition to DG's monopoly share (over 90%) of the service aftermarket, the record contains evidence of barriers to entry (e.g., costs to TPMs of obtaining diagnostics and other service \"tools\"), market imperfections (e.g., high information costs for computer purchasers and high switching costs for DG equipment owners), and more importantly, supracompetitive service prices and price discrimination among DG service customers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn61\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61_ref\">61</a>\n        <p> Grumman also seeks to portray the alleged positive and negative tying arrangements as exclusionary conduct violative of Section 2.  We do not consider this argument because of our determination in the previous section that DG's ADEX policies cannot properly be described as arrangements conditioning the sale of one product on the purchase or non-purchase of another</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn62\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62_ref\">62</a>\n        <p> Elsewhere in its brief, DG adds that DG's \"refus[al] to allow Grumman to use MV/ADEX is ... the precise conduct that the antitrust and copyright laws are designed to encourage.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn63\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63_ref\">63</a>\n        <p> It is in any event well settled that concerted and contractual behavior that threatens competition is not immune from antitrust inquiry simply because it involves the exercise of copyright privileges.
