In December 1992, David Sustache Rivera was\r                           \n\nindicted  for armed car jacking  in violation of  18 U.S.C.  \n\n2119(1).   In January 1993, Sustache  was indicted separately\n\nfor two  additional car  jackings  in violation  of the  same\n\nstatute.  In one of these two, serious injury had resulted to\n\na victim, and the government also invoked 18 U.S.C.   2119(2)\n\nproviding for an additional penalty in such cases.\n\n     On  March 9, 1993,  Sustache appeared to  enter a guilty\n\nplea  in all  three  cases which  had  been consolidated  for\n\ntrial.   By then Sustache had been examined by a psychologist\n\nwho  reported   that  he   was  competent  to   stand  trial.\n\nNevertheless, when defense counsel expressed some reservation\n\nabout   Sustache's   \"thorough  understanding   of   all  the\n\nproceedings,\" the court asked Sustache why he wanted to plead\n\nguilty, and Sustache replied:  \"I don't remember.\"\n\n     The district court then said that it was satisfied based\n\non the  psychologist's report that Sustache  was competent to\n\nstand trial.  The court said that it was unwilling to  accept\n\na guilty plea  from a  defendant who said  that he could  not\n\nremember  why he was  pleading guilty.   When defense counsel\n\nagain urged the  court to  inquire about a  guilty plea,  the\n\ncourt questioned the defendant further.  Ultimately defendant\n\nasserted  that he had not committed the crimes charged in the\n\nindictments.\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\n\n     The  court  then ordered  the jury  to be  summoned and,\n\nwithout  any  objection  from  defense  counsel,   the  trial\n\ncommenced.  There was  extensive testimony as to each  of the\n\nthree car jackings including an eye witness identification of\n\nSustache by a different  witness in each of the  three cases.\n\nOn  March 11,  1993, the  jury found  Sustache guilty  on all\n\ncounts.  In May 1993, the district court sentenced him to 444\n\nmonths' imprisonment.\n\n     On  this appeal, Sustache's  appellate counsel, who also\n\nrepresented Sustache at trial, makes two main arguments.  The\n\nfirst is that two of the three identifications of Sustache at\n\ntrial were flawed.  The flaws, according to the counsel, were\n\nviolations of  provisions of Puerto Rico's  Rules of Criminal\n\nProcedure.    The  provisions  in question  are  designed  to\n\nprevent  suggestive identifications  and preserve  records of\n\nthe identification process. \n\n     The government responds that none of these objections to\n\nthe identifications were made in advance of trial as required\n\nby Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3), which specifies that motions to\n\nsuppress  evidence be  raised prior  to  trial.   Among other\n\nreasons, this requirement protects  the government's right to\n\nappeal the  grant of  the suppression motion  before jeopardy\n\nhas  attached.   Consonantly, the  failure to  raise such  an\n\nissue  by pre-trial  motion  waives the  claim.   See  United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Gomez-Benabe, 985 F.2d 607 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                  \n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\n\n     In  a  reply  brief,  Sustache's  counsel  argues  \"that\n\ndefendant was not granted the opportunity to file a motion to\n\nsuppress\";  the gist of the argument is that Sustache and his\n\ncounsel  came to court on  March 9, 1993,  expecting to plead\n\nguilty  and were surprised to find the case was proceeding to\n\ntrial at once.  Defense counsel refers us to Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n12(f)'s  provision allowing  the  district  court \"for  cause\n\nshown\" to relieve any defendant from waiver.\n\n     Rule 12(f)  gives authority  to the district  court, and\n\nthere is no indication  that defendant ever sought  to invoke\n\nit  there.  Further, when the district court ordered the case\n\nto trial  forthwith, defense counsel  did not object  that he\n\nwas  unprepared or  needed additional  time to  file motions.\n\nNothing in the  reply brief  in this court  even attempts  to\n\ndescribe  the  deadlines  for  pre-trial  motions  that  were\n\napplicable  to this  case.  So  far as  we can  tell from the\n\nrecord, the claimed \"lack of opportunity\" to move to suppress\n\nis an afterthought.\n\n     Nor is there any  basis for asserting plain error.   The\n\nprovisions  invoked  by  counsel  related  to identifications\n\nunder  local law,  and identifications  in federal  court are\n\ngoverned by federal  law.  United  States v. Sutherland,  929\r                                                                   \n\nF.2d 765  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 83 (1991).  In\r                                              \n\nthis  case  the identifications  were  carried  out by  local\n\nofficials  before  the   case  was  transferred   to  federal\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\n\nauthorities.   There is no indication  that federal officials\n\nwere   seeking  to  circumvent   local  protections  or  take\n\nadvantage of any flagrant abuse.  See United States v. Pratt,\r                                                                        \n\n913 F.2d 982  (1st Cir. 1990),  cert. denied, 111 S.  Ct. 681\r                                                        \n\n(1991).\n\n     The identifications  may or  may not have  been somewhat\n\nsuggestive; the defense version of what happened is not based\n\non  any  district  court  findings   since  the  lack  of   a\n\nsuppression  motion meant  no ruling  on the issues  was ever\n\nrequired.     The  fact   that  there  were   three  separate\n\nidentifications, one  of  which is  not  even claimed  to  be\n\ntainted, strongly suggests that  this is not a case  that can\n\nbe  described as a miscarriage of justice.  See United States\r                                                                         \n\nv. Olano, 113 S. Ct. 1770 (1993).\r                    \n\n     Sustache's  other independent  claim  of error  requires\n\nless discussion.   In  his opening brief,  Sustache's counsel\n\nsays that  the district  court committed reversible  error by\n\ninstructing the  jury that  reasonable doubt meant  \"proof of\n\nsuch convincing character that  a person would be  willing to\n\nrely  and act upon  it.\"  Although no  objection was taken to\n\nany part of the reasonable  doubt instruction given at trial,\n\ncounsel correctly asserts that the quoted language is akin to\n\nan instruction found  to constitute plain error.   See United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Colon Pagan, 1 F.3d 80 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                 \n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\n\n     The  difficulty  is  that  we  cannot  find  the  quoted\n\nlanguage  in  any   portion  of  the  court's  two   sets  of\n\ninstructions   on  reasonable   doubt;   one  was   given  in\n\npreliminary  instructions prior  to testimony, and  the other\n\nwas  delivered in a somewhat  different form at  the close of\n\nthe  evidence.   Although counsel's  brief uses  the language\n\njust quoted  and later  paraphrases the  alleged instruction,\n\nneither reference is accompanied by any record citation.  The\n\ngovernment's brief asserts that  the alleged language was not\n\nused, and we have no reason to disagree.\n\n     Sustache's   brief  also  draws  our  attention  to  the\n\ndistrict court's  statement that  \"[a] reasonable doubt  is a\n\ndoubt  based upon  reason and common  sense.\"   The statement\n\nthat  a reasonable  doubt is  a doubt  based upon  reason and\n\ncommon sense is widely used in pattern instructions, see 1 L.\r                                                                    \n\nSand, J. Siffert, W. Loughlin &amp; S. Reiss, Modern Federal Jury\r                                                                         \n\nInstructions    4.01, at  4-8 (1994), and  Sustache offers no\r                        \n\nbasis for thinking that  this reference was error, let  alone\n\nplain error.\n\n     The  trial  judge  also  said  that  \"[p]roof  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt  is proof  that leaves you  firmly convinced\n\nthat the defendant is guilty.\"  But the fact that one form of\n\n\"convince\" was  used both in the  Colon-Pagan instruction and\r                                                         \n\nin this case does not assist defense counsel, although it may\n\nexplain  the mistaken claim that  the instruction here is the\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\n\none  condemned in Colon-Pagan.  As that case makes clear, the\r                                         \n\nproblem in Colon-Pagan was not with the word \"convincing\" but\r                                  \n\nwith the suggestion  that a reasonable doubt  would not exist\n\nso  long as \"a person . . .  would be willing to rely and act\n\nupon\" the proof presented.  See 1 F.3d at 81.\r                                           \n\n     The \"firmly convinced\" phrasing has been used in a Ninth\n\nCircuit  pattern  instruction  and in  the  Federal  Judicial\n\nCenter's pattern instructions, see Sand, supra,   4.01, at 4-\r                                                          \n\n15  &amp;  n.33;  and  while its  use  may  be  limited,  we have\n\nourselves upheld a somewhat  similar statement that equates a\n\nreasonable  doubt with  jurors' inability  to \"say  that they\n\nhave a settled conviction of the truth of the charge.\"  E.g.,\r                                                                        \n\nUnited States v. O'Brien, 972 F.2d 12, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                                    \n\nSee also Victor  v. Nebraska,  114 S. Ct.  1239, 1253  (1994)\r                                        \n\n(Ginsburg, J., concurring).  We certainly have no occasion to\n\nrevisit  the issue here where  no direct criticism is offered\n\nof the \"firmly convinced\" language.\n\n     Finally, we note  that Sustache's counsel,  having moved\n\nto dispense with oral  argument on the ground that  there was\n\nno   need  for  it,  thereafter  submitted  to  the  court  a\n\n\"supplemental brief  in lieu of  oral argument.\"   This brief\n\nelaborates a number  of the points  previously argued in  the\n\nopening and reply briefs.  Since no motion for  leave to file\n\nthis  additional  brief was  submitted,  we  cannot deny  the\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\n\nmotion, but we do  decline either to docket or  consider this\n\nimpermissible filing.\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\n",

Sec. 2119(1).  In January 1993, Sustache was indicted separately for two additional car jackings in violation of the same statute.  In one of these two, serious injury had resulted to a victim, and the government also invoked 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2119(2) providing for an additional penalty in such cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1993, Sustache appeared to enter a guilty plea in all three cases which had been consolidated for trial.  By then Sustache had been examined by a psychologist who reported that he was competent to stand trial.  Nevertheless, when defense counsel expressed some reservation about Sustache's \"thorough understanding of all the proceedings,\" the court asked Sustache why he wanted to plead guilty, and Sustache replied:  \"I don't remember.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then said that it was satisfied based on the psychologist's report that Sustache was competent to stand trial.  The court said that it was unwilling to accept a guilty plea from a defendant who said that he could not remember why he was pleading guilty.  When defense counsel again urged the court to inquire about a guilty plea, the court questioned the defendant further.  Ultimately defendant asserted that he had not committed the crimes charged in the indictments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then ordered the jury to be summoned and, without any objection from defense counsel, the trial commenced.  There was extensive testimony as to each of the three car jackings including an eye witness identification of Sustache by a different witness in each of the three cases.  On March 11, 1993, the jury found Sustache guilty on all counts.  In May 1993, the district court sentenced him to 444 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Sustache's appellate counsel, who also represented Sustache at trial, makes two main arguments.  The first is that two of the three identifications of Sustache at trial were flawed.  The flaws, according to the counsel, were violations of provisions of Puerto Rico's Rules of Criminal Procedure.  The provisions in question are designed to prevent suggestive identifications and preserve records of the identification process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that none of these objections to the identifications were made in advance of trial as required by Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 12(b)(3), which specifies that motions to suppress evidence be raised prior to trial.  Among other reasons, this requirement protects the government's right to appeal the grant of the suppression motion before jeopardy has attached.  Consonantly, the failure to raise such an issue by pre-trial motion waives the claim.   See United States v. Gomez- Benabe, 985 F.2d 607 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a reply brief, Sustache's counsel argues \"that defendant was not granted the opportunity to file a motion to suppress\";  the gist of the argument is that Sustache and his counsel came to court on March 9, 1993, expecting to plead guilty and were surprised to find the case was proceeding to trial at once.  Defense counsel refers us to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 12(f)'s provision allowing the district court \"for cause shown\" to relieve any defendant from waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 12(f) gives authority to the district court, and there is no indication that defendant ever sought to invoke it there.  Further, when the district court ordered the case to trial forthwith, defense counsel did not object that he was unprepared or needed additional time to file motions.  Nothing in the reply brief in this court even attempts to describe the deadlines for pre-trial motions that were applicable to this case.  So far as we can tell from the record, the claimed \"lack of opportunity\" to move to suppress is an afterthought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any basis for asserting plain error.  The provisions invoked by counsel related to identifications under local law, and identifications in federal court are governed by federal law.   United States v. Sutherland, 929 F.2d 765 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 83 (1991).  In this case the identifications were carried out by local officials before the case was transferred to federal authorities.  There is no indication that federal officials were seeking to circumvent local protections or take advantage of any flagrant abuse.   See United States v. Pratt, 913 F.2d 982 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S.

The fact that there were three separate identifications, one of which is not even claimed to be tainted, strongly suggests that this is not a case that can be described as a miscarriage of justice.   See United States v. Olano, 113 S. Ct. 1770 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sustache's other independent claim of error requires less discussion.  In his opening brief, Sustache's counsel says that the district court committed reversible error by instructing the jury that reasonable doubt meant \"proof of such convincing character that a person would be willing to rely and act upon it.\"  Although no objection was taken to any part of the reasonable doubt instruction given at trial, counsel correctly asserts that the quoted language is akin to an instruction found to constitute plain error.   See United States v. Colon Pagan, 1 F.3d 80 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that we cannot find the quoted language in any portion of the court's two sets of instructions on reasonable doubt;  one was given in preliminary instructions prior to testimony, and the other was delivered in a somewhat different form at the close of the evidence.  Although counsel's brief uses the language just quoted and later paraphrases the alleged instruction, neither reference is accompanied by any record citation.  The government's brief asserts that the alleged language was not used, and we have no reason to disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sustache's brief also draws our attention to the district court's statement that \"[a] reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense.\"  The statement that a reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense is widely used in pattern instructions, see 1 L. Sand, J. Siffert, W. Loughlin &amp; S. Reiss, Modern Federal Jury Instructions p 4.01, at 4-8 (1994), and Sustache offers no basis for thinking that this reference was error, let alone plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge also said that \"[p]roof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty.\"  But the fact that one form of \"convince\" was used both in the Colon-Pagan instruction and in this case does not assist defense counsel, although it may explain the mistaken claim that the instruction here is the one condemned in Colon-Pagan.  As that case makes clear, the problem in Colon-Pagan was not with the word \"convincing\" but with the suggestion that a reasonable doubt would not exist so long as \"a person ... would be willing to rely and act upon\" the proof presented.  See 1 F.3d at 81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"firmly convinced\" phrasing has been used in a Ninth Circuit pattern instruction and in the Federal Judicial Center's pattern instructions, see Sand, supra, p 4.01, at 4-15 &amp; n.33;  and while its use may be limited, we have ourselves upheld a somewhat similar statement that equates a reasonable doubt with jurors' inability to \"say that they have a settled conviction of the truth of the charge.\"   E.g., United States v.

Pereira, Assistant United States Attorney, Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jose A. Quiles-Espinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, on brief for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.Puerto Rico</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA, Circuit Judge, BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, and BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1992, David Sustache Rivera was indicted for armed car jacking in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2119(1).  In January 1993, Sustache was indicted separately for two additional car jackings in violation of the same statute.  In one of these two, serious injury had resulted to a victim, and the government also invoked 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2119(2) providing for an additional penalty in such cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1993, Sustache appeared to enter a guilty plea in all three cases which had been consolidated for trial.  By then Sustache had been examined by a psychologist who reported that he was competent to stand trial.  Nevertheless, when defense counsel expressed some reservation about Sustache's \"thorough understanding of all the proceedings,\" the court asked Sustache why he wanted to plead guilty, and Sustache replied:  \"I don't remember.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then said that it was satisfied based on the psychologist's report that Sustache was competent to stand trial.  The court said that it was unwilling to accept a guilty plea from a defendant who said that he could not remember why he was pleading guilty.  When defense counsel again urged the court to inquire about a guilty plea, the court questioned the defendant further.  Ultimately defendant asserted that he had not committed the crimes charged in the indictments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then ordered the jury to be summoned and, without any objection from defense counsel, the trial commenced.  There was extensive testimony as to each of the three car jackings including an eye witness identification of Sustache by a different witness in each of the three cases.  On March 11, 1993, the jury found Sustache guilty on all counts.  In May 1993, the district court sentenced him to 444 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Sustache's appellate counsel, who also represented Sustache at trial, makes two main arguments.  The first is that two of the three identifications of Sustache at trial were flawed.  The flaws, according to the counsel, were violations of provisions of Puerto Rico's Rules of Criminal Procedure.  The provisions in question are designed to prevent suggestive identifications and preserve records of the identification process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that none of these objections to the identifications were made in advance of trial as required by Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 12(b)(3), which specifies that motions to suppress evidence be raised prior to trial.  Among other reasons, this requirement protects the government's right to appeal the grant of the suppression motion before jeopardy has attached.  Consonantly, the failure to raise such an issue by pre-trial motion waives the claim.   See United States v. Gomez- Benabe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600256\"><a href=\"/opinion/600256/united-states-v-miguel-gomez-benabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span> </a></span>(1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a reply brief, Sustache's counsel argues \"that defendant was not granted the opportunity to file a motion to suppress\";  the gist of the argument is that Sustache and his counsel came to court on March 9, 1993, expecting to plead guilty and were surprised to find the case was proceeding to trial at once.  Defense counsel refers us to Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 12(f)'s provision allowing the district court \"for cause shown\" to relieve any defendant from waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 12(f) gives authority to the district court, and there is no indication that defendant ever sought to invoke it there.  Further, when the district court ordered the case to trial forthwith, defense counsel did not object that he was unprepared or needed additional time to file motions.  Nothing in the reply brief in this court even attempts to describe the deadlines for pre-trial motions that were applicable to this case.  So far as we can tell from the record, the claimed \"lack of opportunity\" to move to suppress is an afterthought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any basis for asserting plain error.  The provisions invoked by counsel related to identifications under local law, and identifications in federal court are governed by federal law.   United States v. Sutherland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558565\"><a href=\"/opinion/558565/united-states-v-dianne-sutherland-united-states-of-america-v-alan-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is no indication that federal officials were seeking to circumvent local protections or take advantage of any flagrant abuse.   See United States v.
