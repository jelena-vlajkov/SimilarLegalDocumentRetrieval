PAGE,\r\n\n                 Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n      [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\nSelya, Circuit Judge,\r\nBownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nTina Schneider on brief for appellant.\r\nJay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and F. Mark Terison, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nFebruary 4, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and record, we\r\nperceive no clear error in the district court's estimate of the\r\ntown's \"loss.\"  See U.S.S.G.  2F1.1, application note 7; U.S.S.G.\r\nB1.1, commentary; see also U.S.S.G.  2C1.1 &amp; 2C1.7.  Given the\r\ninformation available to the district court, that estimate\r\nreasonably accounted for the direct reduction in the town's tax\r\nrevenues that was occasioned by defendant's fraudulent conduct. \r\nDefendant's specific appellate arguments are meritless.\r\nThe government's motion for summary disposition is granted.\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                          -2-\n",
