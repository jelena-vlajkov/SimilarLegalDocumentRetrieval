London  of  conspiring  to\r\n\nconduct and actually conducting  the affairs of an enterprise\r\n\nthrough a pattern of racketeering activity (\"RICO conspiracy\"\r\n\nand \"RICO  substantive\"), money  laundering, failing  to file\r\n\ncurrency transaction reports  (\"CTRs\"), conspiring to  commit\r\n\nextortion, and aiding and  abetting extortion.  Subsequent to\r\n\nthe jury  verdict, London also pleaded guilty to tax evasion.\r\n\nFor  his   crimes,  London  was  sentenced   to  188  months'\r\n\nimprisonment and fined  $500,000.  In addition, he  agreed to\r\n\nforfeit $865,000.\r\n\n          In  this appeal, London challenges his convictions,\r\n\narguing that the  district court  erred:  (1)  in failing  to\r\n\nsuppress  certain  evidence   relevant  to   his  counts   of\r\n\nconviction; (2) in  instructing the jury on the law regarding\r\n\nfailure to file CTRs; and (3) in  failing to grant his motion\r\n\nfor  a judgment of acquittal on the money laundering and RICO\r\n\ncounts.   After carefully considering the parties' arguments,\r\n\nwe affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\nA.  Factual Background\r            A.  Factual Background\r                                  \r\n\n          London operated Heller's Cafe (\"Heller's), a bar in\r\n\nChelsea, Massachusetts.  He also ran a check-cashing service,\r\n\nknown as M  &amp; L Associates (\"M &amp; L\"), out of a small enclosed\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\narea  in the bar.  M  &amp; L charged its customers  a 1% or 1.5%\r\n\ncommission on each check cashed.  Both Heller's and M &amp; L had\r\n\nat least one employee other than London.\r\n\n          The  evidence at trial demonstrated that bookmakers\r\n\ntended to  frequent Heller's and  to use  M &amp; L  as a  check-\r\n\ncashing service.   Sometimes, M  &amp; L cashed  bookmaker checks\r\n\nthat banks would not  accept.  For example, some  checks were\r\n\nneither  made  out  by  nor  payable  to the  bookmakers  (or\r\n\nbookmakers' agents)  who were cashing them.  Others were made\r\n\nout either to fictitious names or to real persons or entities\r\n\nwho  were not  to receive  the funds.   London  neither asked\r\n\nabout the names on the checks he cashed nor required that the\r\n\nchecks be  endorsed.  And before December 17, 1986 -- the day\r\n\non  which  federal  agents   executed  a  search  warrant  at\r\n\nHeller's,  see infra  at  6  --  London  never  filed  a  CTR\r                                \r\n\nnotifying the  Internal Revenue  Service (\"IRS\") of  his many\r\n\ncurrency transactions  involving more  than $10,000.   See 31\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.    5313(a) (requiring financial institutions to report\r\n\ncurrency  transactions   in  the  manner  prescribed  by  the\r\n\nSecretary  of  the Treasury)  and  31  C.F.R.    103.11(i)(3)\r                                             \r\n\n(check-casher  is a  financial institution)  and 31  C.F.R.  \r                                                            \r\n\n103.22(a)(1) (financial institutions must report all currency\r\n\ntransactions involving more than $10,000 to the IRS). \r\n\n          London's operating  procedures were a  boon to  his\r\n\nbookmaker  customers.   Not  only  did  London provide  these\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ncustomers with an immediate and untraceable source of cash to\r\n\npay their various expenses (including gamblers' winnings), he\r\n\nenabled  them  to accept  checks  from  their own  customers.\r\n\nThis, in turn, increased business volume, for the ability  to\r\n\npay  gambling  debts by  check  encouraged  gamblers to  make\r\n\nlarger and more  frequent bets.  It  also made it easier  for\r\n\nout-of-state gamblers  to do business with  local bookmakers,\r\n\nand possible  for  some gamblers  to pay  debts with  company\r\n\nfunds  (and thereby gamble with  money on which  they paid no\r\n\ntaxes).\r\n\n          London's  promotion of bookmaking often took a more\r\n\nactive form.  In 1986, London operated a bookmaking operation\r\n\nwith  one Kenny  Miller.   He  also  helped run  one  Dominic\r\n\nIsabella's  bookmaking  operation  while  Isabella  was  ill.\r\n\nFinally, London acted as a \"pay and collect\" man for  many of\r\n\nhis bookmaker customers, making payments to  winning gamblers\r\n\nand collecting payments from losers.\r\n\n          London also assisted Vincent Ferrara, the leader of\r\n\nan  organized   crime  group,  in  collecting  \"rent\"  (i.e.,\r\n\nprotection money) from bookmakers.  London identified certain\r\n\nof his bookmaker customers to Ferrara, telling him \"anybody I\r\n\nget  you  get.\"    London  then  summoned  the  bookmakers to\r\n\nHeller's to meet with Ferrara, who demanded that they pay him\r\n\nanywhere  from  $500  to  $1000  (or  more)  per   month  for\r\n\n\"protection\" and  help in debt collection.   London collected\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nrent  payments and, at least once, passed along a request for\r\n\ndebt  collection assistance  from  a bookmaker  who had  been\r\n\ninduced to accept Ferrara's protection.\r\n\n          As stated above, London never filed a CTR with  the\r\n\nIRS  prior  to  the  execution   of  the  search  warrant  on\r\n\nDecember 17,  1986.     From   December  18,   1986,  through\r\n\nDecember 31, 1988, however, he filed 211 CTR's on behalf of M\r\n\n&amp;  L.  Although London  had instructed his  customers to make\r\n\ncertain that each check was for less than $10,000, London did\r\n\ncash  individual checks  that  were in  amounts greater  than\r\n\n$10,000.   When  he cashed  a group  of checks  for the  same\r\n\ncustomer, London would often  deposit the checks on different\r\n\ndays or in  different bank accounts.   There was  testimonial\r\n\nevidence tending  to indicate  that London  was aware  of the\r\n\nstatutory  and regulatory  reporting requirements  during the\r\n\nperiod in which he failed to file any CTRs with the IRS.\r\n\nB.  Procedural History\r            B.  Procedural History\r                                  \r\n\n          On October 28, 1986,  in response to an application\r\n\nand affidavit  made pursuant to an  on-going investigation of\r\n\nLondon,  his businesses,  and  his  associates, the  district\r\n\ncourt issued two orders authorizing the government to conduct\r\n\nelectronic  surveillance  at  Heller's.     The  first  order\r\n\nauthorized, for a thirty-day period, the interception of oral\r\n\ncommunications in and adjacent to the enclosed area  in which\r\n\nM  &amp; L operated; the second authorized, also for a thirty-day\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nperiod, the  recording of  wire communications made  from two\r\n\ntelephones  located behind the bar.  In order to minimize the\r\n\ninterception  of otherwise  non-interceptable communications,\r\n\nthe court's  orders limited surveillance to  times when named\r\n\ntargets of the  investigation were on Heller's  premises.  On\r\n\nDecember 3, 1986, the  court extended each of the  orders for\r\n\nan  additional  thirty days.    Evidence  derived from  these\r\n\ninterceptions was introduced against London at trial.\r\n\n          On December  17, 1986, federal agents  applied to a\r\n\nmagistrate  judge for  a warrant  authorizing them  to search\r\n\nHeller's for  evidence  of unlawful  gambling,  loansharking,\r\n\ndistribution of narcotics, money  laundering, and failure  to\r\n\nfile  CTRs.    The   magistrate  judge  issued  the  warrant,\r\n\nauthorizing  the  agents  to  search  \"Heller's  Cafe,  which\r\n\noccupies the first floor and basement of 110 Chestnut Street\"\r\n\nand to  seize  \"books and  records, ledgers,  correspondence,\r\n\nnotes, slips, checks and  any other documents, including bank\r\n\nrecords,  which  reflect  unlawful   gambling,  loansharking,\r\n\nnarcotics   distribution,  and   failure  to   file  currency\r\n\ntransaction  reports;  and  U.S.  currency  which constitutes\r\n\nproceeds of these offenses.\"  The agents executed the warrant\r\n\nlater that day,  and seized,  inter alia, almost  all of  the\r                                                    \r\n\nrecords found in the enclosed area from which M &amp; L operated.\r\n\nEvidence  seized in the course of  this search was introduced\r\n\nagainst London at trial.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          On April 11, 1990, a federal  grand jury returned a\r\n\ntwo-count indictment charging London with income tax evasion.\r\n\nOn  May 10, 1990, the  grand jury returned  a fifty-one count\r\n\nsuperseding  indictment charging London with, inter alia, the\r                                                                    \r\n\ncounts  of conviction:    one count  of  RICO conspiracy,  18\r\n\nU.S.C.    1962(d); one count of RICO substantive, 18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1962(c);  twelve  counts of  money  laundering,  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1956(a)(1); twelve counts of failing to file  CTRs, 31 U.S.C.\r\n\n    5313(a) and  5322(b); one  count of conspiring  to commit\r\n\nextortion,  18  U.S.C.     1951;  two counts  of  aiding  and\r\n\nabetting extortion, 18 U.S.C.    2 and 1951; and one count of\r\n\ntax evasion  for  tax  year  1985, 26  U.S.C.     7201.    On\r\n\nSeptember  5,   1991,  the  grand  jury   returned  a  second\r\n\nsuperseding  indictment which  charged  no  new offenses  but\r\n\nbrought  the  indictment within  the  purview  of the  United\r\n\nStates Sentencing  Guidelines by extending the  period of the\r\n\nalleged RICO conspiracy to after November 1987.\r\n\n          On August  17,  1992,  the  district  court  orally\r\n\ndenied  London's  previously-filed  motion  to  suppress  the\r\n\nevidence  seized  during the  December  17,  1986, search  of\r\n\nHeller's.  On  August 18,  1992, the court  issued a  written\r\n\nmemorandum and order denying London's previously-filed motion\r\n\nto suppress the fruits of the electronic surveillance.\r\n\n          Trial commenced  on January 4,  1993, and concluded\r\n\non February 19,  1993, when the jury returned guilty verdicts\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\non the counts of  conviction listed above.  The  other counts\r\n\ncontained in  the  second superseding  indictment either  had\r\n\nbeen  dismissed by  the  government prior  to  trial or  were\r\n\ndismissed by the district  court at trial.  In  addition, the\r\n\njury acquitted London on one money laundering count.  On June\r\n\n30,  1993, the district court sentenced  London.  This appeal\r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n          As  set forth  above, London's  appellate arguments\r\n\nfall  into three main groups.  First, London takes issue with\r\n\nthe district  court's  denial  of  his  suppression  motions.\r\n\nSecond,  London  challenges  the jury  instructions  given in\r\n\nconnection  with   the  counts  of  the   second  superseding\r\n\nindictment charging  him with failing  to file CTRs.   Third,\r\n\nLondon  makes  sundry arguments  that there  was insufficient\r\n\nevidence  to   support   his  money   laundering   and   RICO\r\n\nconvictions.  We discuss each of London's arguments in turn.\r\n\nA.   Denial  of the  Motion  to Suppress  the  Fruits of  the\r            A.   Denial  of the  Motion  to Suppress  the  Fruits of  the\r                                                                         \r\nElectronic Surveillance\r            Electronic Surveillance\r                                   \r\n\n          London  contends that the  district court  erred in\r\n\ndenying  his motion to suppress  the fruits of the electronic\r\n\nsurveillance conducted at Heller's in  1986.  He claims  that\r\n\nthe aforementioned surveillance ran afoul of Title III of the\r\n\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n   2510 et  seq. (\"Title  III\") -- the  federal statute  that\r                            \r\n\ngoverns  electronic surveillance  -- in  five ways:   (1)  no\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nDepartment  of Justice  official  designated in  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n2516(1) had  authorized the  local United States  Attorney to\r\n\napply  for the  initial interception  orders; (2)  the orders\r\n\nimproperly  allowed the  government to  monitor conversations\r\n\nrelating to  money laundering, which  was not an  offense for\r\n\nwhich  interception  could  be   ordered,  see  18  U.S.C.   \r                                                          \r\n\n2516(1)(a)-(o), on  the date the interception  orders issued;\r\n\n(3)  the  government  intercepted  and  disclosed  extortion-\r\n\nrelated  conversations  --  conversations pertaining  to  the\r\n\npaying  of \"rent\"  to  Ferrara --  beyond  the scope  of  the\r\n\ncourt's  orders; (4)  the  court ordered  and the  government\r\n\nemployed inadequate minimization procedures under 18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2518(5);  and (5)  the  government's  application misled  the\r\n\ndistrict court as to  the necessity for conducting electronic\r\n\nsurveillance,  in  violation  of  18   U.S.C.     2518(1)(c).\r\n\nBecause  we are not persuaded  by any of  these arguments, we\r\n\naffirm the district court's denial of the suppression motion.\r\n\n          1.

Giordano,  416 U.S. 505, 524-29 (1974).   As\r                                     \r\n\nnoted,   London  contends   that  the   initial  interception\r\n\napplication  was not  authorized by  a statutorily-designated\r\n\nJustice Department official.  London is mistaken.  \r\n\n          The government attached to its initial interception\r\n\napplication  the  first  page  of  a  two-page  authorization\r\n\nmemorandum prepared on October 24, 1986, by  William F. Weld,\r\n\nthen the Justice Department's Assistant Attorney  General for\r\n\nthe  Criminal  Division, and  the  second page  of  the cover\r\n\nletter which  accompanied  the  Weld  memorandum,  which  was\r\n\nsigned   for  Weld   by  Frederick   D.  Hess,   the  Justice\r\n\nDepartment's Director of the Office of Enforcement Operations\r\n\nof the Criminal  Division.  It is undisputed that  Weld was a\r\n\nstatutorily-designated  official  and  Hess  was   not.    In\r\n\nrejecting  London's  suppression motion,  the  district court\r\n\nfound that  Weld had authorized  the interception application\r\n\n(as  the application  had  stated) and  that \"the  government\r\n\ncommitted a collating error by providing page one of the Weld\r\n\napproval letter  followed by  page two of  a separate  letter\r\n\nwritten  by Hess  to Robert  S. Mueller,  III, Acting  United\r\n\nStates Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.\"\r\n\n          London  does  not  dispute  the  accuracy   of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  \"collating  error\"  finding;  nor  does he\r\n\ndisagree that  the finding would validate  the application if\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nthe district court was  empowered to look beyond the  face of\r\n\nthe  application in  deciding whether  there had  been proper\r\n\nauthorization.  Relying on United  States v. Chavez, 416 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n562 (1974), and United  States v. O'Malley, 764 F.2d  38 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir. 1985),  he instead argues  that the finding  cannot save\r\n\nthe government's  application because the district  court was\r\n\nlimited  to  a  \"facial  analysis\" of  the  authorization  in\r\n\ndetermining  whether  a  statutorily-designated official  had\r\n\napproved   the  interception  application.     Even   if  his\r\n\nconstruction of Chavez and  O'Malley is correct (an  issue on\r                                                \r\n\nwhich we  express significant  doubt but no  formal opinion),\r\n\nthe facial analysis London advocates reveals that Weld -- and\r\n\nnot Hess -- authorized the interception application.\r\n\n          London's argument hinges entirely  on the fact that\r\n\nHess  signed on  behalf  of  Weld  the  second  page  of  the\r\n\nmiscollated authorizing  papers  that were  attached  to  the\r\n\ninterception  application.   What  it neglects  to take  into\r\n\naccount, however, is that  Weld signed the first page,  which\r                                           \r\n\nstates at the top  that it is a  memorandum from \"William  F.\r\n\nWeld,   Assistant   Attorney  General,   Criminal  Division.\"\r\n\nFurthermore, that same first  page clearly indicates that the\r\n\nAssistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division\r\n\n(i.e., Weld) authorized the application:\r\n\n               By virtue of the authority vested in\r\n          him by  Section 2516 of Title  18, United\r\n          States  Code, the Attorney General of the\r\n          United States  has by Order  Number 1088-\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          85,  dated  March  28,   1985,  specially\r\n          designated the Assistant Attorney General\r\n          in charge  of  the Criminal  Division  to\r\n          authorize  applications for  court orders\r\n          authorizing the interception  of wire  or\r\n          oral   communication.      As  the   duly\r\n          appointed  Assistant Attorney  General in\r\n          charge  of  the  Criminal Division,  this\r\n          power  is exercisable by  me.  WHEREFORE,\r\n          acting  under  this  delegated  power,  I\r\n          hereby   authorize  the   above-described\r\n          [London]  application to  be made  by any\r\n          investigative or  law enforcement officer\r\n          of  the  United   States  as  defined  in\r\n          Section  2510(7)  of  Title   18,  United\r\n          States Code.\r\n\nFinally, nothing in  the text  of either page  of the  papers\r\n\npresented to  the district court even  remotely suggests that\r\n\nHess, and not Weld, authorized the application.  \r\n\n          We  therefore  reject  London's  argument  that the\r\n\ninitial  interception application  was  not authorized  by  a\r\n\nstatutorily-designated Justice Department official.\r\n\n          2.

Interception of Conversations Relating to\r                                                                   \r\n          Money Laundering\r                      Money Laundering\r                                      \r\n\n          Title  III  specifies  the  offenses  for  which an\r\n\ninterception order  may issue.   18 U.S.C.    2516(1)(a)-(o).\r\n\nMoney  laundering in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    1956  was so\r\n\nspecified by  legislation that  became effective  October 27,\r\n\n1986.  Pub. L. 99-570, Title I,   1365(c), Oct. 27, 1986, 100\r\n\nStat. 3207-35.   As  noted,  London argues  that the  initial\r\n\ninterception   orders   authorized   the    interception   of\r\n\nconversations relating to money  laundering prior to the date\r\n\non  which money laundering was added to 18 U.S.C.   2516(1)'s\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nlist  of offenses.    Even if  we  assume arguendo  that  the\r                                                              \r\n\ninitial interception orders did authorize the interception of\r\n\nconversations relating to money laundering in violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.      1956  (a  position  with   which  the  government\r\n\nforcefully  disagrees  and on  which  we  take no  position),\r\n\nLondon's argument lacks a factual basis.\r\n\n           London  claims that  the district  court's initial\r\n\ninterception orders  issued on  October 24, 1986,  three days\r\n\nbefore money  laundering became a predicate  offense under 18\r\n\nU.S.C.     2516(1).   The record  reveals, however,  that the\r\n\ninitial interception  orders issued on October  28, 1986, not\r\n\nOctober  24, 1986.  Thus, money laundering in violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    1956 was an offense for which an interception order\r                              \r\n\ncould issue  at the time  of the initial  interception orders\r\n\nissued in this case.\r\n\n          We  therefore reject  London's  argument  that  the\r\n\ninitial  interception orders  authorized the  interception of\r\n\nconversations  relating to  money laundering  at a  time when\r\n\nmoney laundering was not a predicate  offense under 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  2516(1).\r\n\n          3.    Interception  and  Disclosure  of  Extortion-\r                      3.    Interception  and  Disclosure  of  Extortion-\r                                                                         \r\n\nRelated\r            Related\r                   \r\n          Conversations\r                      Conversations\r                                   \r\n\n          With  certain exceptions,  Title III  prohibits the\r\n\ninterception and disclosure of conversations other than those\r\n\nrelating to  the offenses  specified in the  district court's\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\ninterception order.  See  generally 18 U.S.C.     2511, 2517,\r                                               \r\n\nand  2518(4)(c).  As noted, London argues that the government\r\n\nwrongfully  intercepted  and  disclosed   certain  extortion-\r\n\nrelated  conversations  (i.e.,  conversations concerning  the\r\n\npaying  of  \"rent\" to  Ferrara)  despite  the fact  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court's initial interception  orders did not specify\r\n\nextortion  in violation  of  18 U.S.C.     1951 as  a  target\r\n\noffense.  London's claim of governmental overreaching in this\r\n\ncontext is without merit.\r\n\n          Unlike  London's first  two arguments,  the instant\r\n\none  is not built upon  a faulty factual  basis; extortion in\r\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   1951 was not a target offense listed\r\n\nin the government's interception applications or the district\r\n\ncourt's interception  orders.  This fact  alone, though, does\r\n\nnot  make  the  interception  of   the  \"rent\"  conversations\r\n\nunlawful.     Title   III  clearly   contemplates  that   law\r\n\nenforcement  officials will,  in  the course  of intercepting\r\n\nconversations related to specified target offenses, intercept\r\n\nconversations   \"relating  to   offenses  other   than  those\r\n\nspecified in the order of authorization or approval.\"  See 18\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.    2517(5).  For example,  an intercepted conversation\r\n\ncan  relate to both a specified offense and to an unspecified\r                                                       \r\n\noffense.  In  such a situation, the  interception is unlawful\r\n\nonly  when it  is motivated  by an  illicit purpose  -- e.g.,\r\n\n\"subterfuge\"  interceptions where  the government  applies to\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nintercept conversations relating to offenses  specified in 18\r\n\nU.S.C.       2516(a)-(o)   while   intending   to   intercept\r\n\nconversations  relating to  offenses for  which interceptions\r\n\nare unauthorized or  for which  it has no  probable cause  to\r\n\nobtain an interception order.   See United States v. Angiulo,\r                                                                        \r\n\n847 F.2d 956,980 (1st Cir.), cert.denied, 488 U.S. 852(1988).\r                                                    \r\n\n           Here, the intercepted \"rent\" conversations clearly\r\n\nrelated to  at  least one  offense  -- operating  a  gambling\r\n\nbusiness in violation of 18 U.S.C.   1955 -- specified in the\r\n\ninitial   authorization  orders.      The  victims   of   the\r\n\nrent/extortion scheme  were  bookmakers involved  in  illegal\r\n\ngambling, and  the intercepted conversations provided a means\r\n\nof   identifying  them.     Moreover,   the  district   court\r\n\nsupportably found  that there  was no subterfuge  involved in\r\n\nthe initial interception applications.  See Angiulo, 847 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 980 (clear-error reviewing standard applicable  to finding\r\n\nthat  government's wiretap  application was  not subterfuge).\r\n\nExtortion,  after  all, is  an  enumerated  offense under  18\r\n\nU.S.C.    2516, and  there would  have been  no need for  the\r\n\ngovernment to  engage in subterfuge unless  it suspected that\r\n\nextortion  was taking  place  but lacked  the probable  cause\r\n\nnecessary to intercept conversations pertaining to extortion.\r\n\nLondon makes  no argument along  these lines, and  the record\r\n\ndoes not  suggest this sort  of governmental deception.   The\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\ngovernment's  interception  of the  \"rent\"  conversations was\r\n\ntherefore not unlawful.\r\n\n          We still must consider whether the government acted\r\n\nunlawfully  in disclosing  the rent conversations  during the\r\n\nproceedings below.  The government argues that the disclosure\r\n\nof such  \"other offense\" evidence  is permissible so  long as\r\n\nthe information  is  related  to an  offense  listed  in  the\r\n\ninitial authorization orders.   Cf. United States v. Shields,\r                                                                        \r\n\n999 F.2d  1090, 1097 (7th  Cir. 1993) (\"Since  the government\r\n\nwas free to release  this information to a grand  jury anyway\r\n\nunder the [authorization for the offenses listed in the Title\r\n\nIII  order], it is difficult  to see how  the defendants were\r\n\nharmed when the same  facts were presented in the  context of\r\n\ndifferent offenses.\"),  cert. denied, 115 S.

The  relevant  statutory  provision  permits\r\n\ndisclosure when  the  interception has  been  \"authorized  or\r\n\napproved  by a  judge  of competent  jurisdiction where  such\r\n\njudge finds on subsequent  application that the contents were\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\notherwise intercepted in  accordance with  the provisions  of\r\n\n[Title  III].

In other\r                    \r\n\nwords,  \"the  disclosure  in  subsequent  affidavits  to  the\r\n\nissuing  judge  of  material  facts  constituting or  clearly\r\n\nrelating  to  other   offenses  satisfies  the   Government's\r\n\nobligation  to seek judicial authorization for the disclosure\r\n\nand use  of evidence inadvertently  intercepted.\"  Id.  at 24\r                                                                  \r\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\n          As  the district  court found  in denying  London's\r\n\nsuppression motion, there was implicit  authorization in this\r\n\ncase.   When  the government  applied for  extensions  of the\r\n\ninitial  interception orders, its  attached affidavit advised\r\n\nthe court of interceptions  containing the essential facts of\r\n\nthe extortion violations:\r\n\n          London acts as a  bank and account keeper\r\n          for  other  bookmaking  and  loansharking\r\n          operations  .  .   .  .   [Also] London's\r\n          illegal   businesses,  and   the  illegal\r\n          businesses  for  which  London keeps  the\r\n          accounts, only operate  with the  consent\r\n          and protection of certain  other persons,\r\n          to   whom   London  and   others   pay  a\r\n          percentage  of  their  income  .  .  .  .\r\n          Further   electronic    surveillance   is\r\n          necessary,   however,  to   identify  the\r\n          balance   of   the   members    of   each\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          organization and the relationship between\r\n          London,  these   organizations,  and  the\r\n          persons  to  whom  `rent'  is   paid,  as\r\n          discussed below.\r\n\nThe  attached affidavit  then detailed  London's relationship\r\n\nwith Ferrara.   Thus, the  court's approval of  the extension\r\n\napplication constituted  both  an implicit  finding that  the\r\n\nextortion-related    conversations   were    intercepted   in\r\n\naccordance with  the provisions  of Title III  and permission\r\n\nfor  the subsequent  disclosure  of the  conversations.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMcKinnon, 721 F.2d at 23-24.\r                    \r\n\n          London complains that the affidavit not only failed\r\n\nto seek approval  for subsequent interceptions of  extortion-\r\n\nrelated conversations, but it also failed to  alert the court\r\n\nthat some of the  intercepted conversations related to \"other\r\n\noffense\"  evidence.   While we  certainly think  it advisable\r\n\nthat  the government provide issuing courts with this type of\r\n\nnotice, we  note that it  is not a  sine qua non  of implicit\r                                                            \r\n\nauthorization.  We presume that the court read the supporting\r\n\naffidavit  with care,  and took  seriously its  obligation to\r\n\npolice the interceptions that were taking place.

Without specifying any\r\n\nwrongfully  intercepted  conversations,  London asserts  that\r\n\nthere  was  inadequate governmental  minimization  during the\r\n\ninterceptions  at  Heller's.   Although London's  argument on\r\n\nthis  issue is  a  bit disjointed,  two alleged  inadequacies\r\n\nemerge  from  his brief:   (1)  the court's  order permitting\r\n\nsurveillance whenever a named target was on Heller's premises\r\n\n(instead  of   a  more   restrictive  order);  and   (2)  the\r\n\ngovernment's  policy of  recording all  conversations carried\r\n\nout  in  Spanish  unless  and until  a  bilingual  agent  was\r\n\navailable   to   make  minimization   decisions.      In  the\r\n\ncircumstances of this  case, we  see no error  in either  the\r\n\ncourt's   order   or   the   government's   policy  regarding\r\n\ncommunications in Spanish.\r\n\n          In assessing whether the  government's minimization\r\n\nefforts pass muster  under 18  U.S.C.   2518(5),  we make  an\r\n\nobjective assessment in light  of the facts and circumstances\r\n\nknown to the government at the  relevant points in time.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nScott  v. United States, 436  U.S. 128, 136-37  (1978).  When\r                                   \r\n\nmaking  this assessment, we tend  to focus on  (1) the nature\r\n\nand complexity of the  suspected crimes; (2) the thoroughness\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nof the government's precautions to  bring about minimization;\r\n\nand  (3)   the  degree  of  judicial   supervision  over  the\r\n\nsurveillance process.

We also are\r                                         \r\n\nmindful that Title  III \"does not forbid  the interception of\r\n\nall  nonrelevant  conversations,  but  rather  instructs  the\r\n\nagents to conduct  the surveillance  in such a  manner as  to\r\n\n`minimize' the interception  of such conversations.\"   Scott,\r                                                                        \r\n\n436 U.S. at 140.

In other\r\n\nwords,  they amount  to claims  that an  implicit requirement\r\n\nallegedly imposed on the  government by Uribe and Angiulo  --\r                                                                     \r\n\nthat the government's precautions to bring about minimization\r                                             \r\n\nbe sufficiently \"thorough\"  to pass muster under 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2518(5)   --  has  not  been  met  in  this  case,  and  that\r\n\nsuppression   of   all  intercepted   conversations   is  the\r\n\nappropriate remedy.   Even if we assume  arguendo that London\r                                                             \r\n\ncan win  total suppression without  challenging the propriety\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nof  any  particular interceptions,  we  see no  merit  in his\r\n\narguments.  \r\n\n          London  characterizes  as insufficient  the court's\r\n\n\"targeted individual must be on the premises\" limitation by \r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nstating:\r\n\n          Perhaps, an undercover agent acting  as a\r\n          patron, could [have]  signal[led] when  a\r\n          target  was  talking   on  a   particular\r\n          telephone  or near  one of  the bugs  and\r\n          thereby  minimize[d]  the intrusion  into\r\n          the    privacy   of    innocent   persons\r\n          conversing at other  locations.   Perhaps\r\n          monitoring   agents   could   have   been\r\n          directed  to  cease  monitoring   at  any\r\n          device  when a  target  was not  heard on\r\n          that device.\r\n\nHe has not,  however, effectively  rebutted the  government's\r\n\ncolorful assertion,  made both to  the district court  and on\r\n\nappeal,  that \"had  an undercover  agent remained  inside the\r\n\nsmall, intimate .  . . Heller's Cafe to relay  a signal every\r\n\ntime a target spoke into  a surveillance device, London would\r\n\nhave identified  him as quickly as Ali Baba in his cave would\r\n\nhave  spotted a  spy among  his chosen  forty.\"   Nor has  he\r\n\nrebutted the government's  sworn assertion that \"agents  were\r\n\ninstructed to  and did cease monitoring  when they determined\r\n\nthat none of the  targets was a party to [a]  conversation or\r\n\nthat only personal, non-criminal activity was discussed.\"  In\r\n\nour view, the former of these two assertions is sufficient to\r\n\nrespond to London's  argument that there should have  been an\r\n\nundercover agent inside Heller's,  and the latter effectively\r\n\nundermines  any  suggestion that  the monitoring  agents were\r\n\nfree  to  listen  in  on the  conversations  of  non-targeted\r\n\nindividuals.\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\n          London's  challenge  to  the   government's  policy\r\n\nregarding  Spanish  conversations  is  answered  more easily:\r\n\nwhen an  interpreter is  not reasonably available,  Title III\r\n\nexplicitly   allows   full-scale  recording   and   post  hoc\r                                                                         \r\n\nminimization   of  conversations   carried  out   in  foreign\r\n\nlanguages.   See  18  U.S.C.    2518(5)  (\"In the  event  the\r                            \r\n\nintercepted communication  is in a code  or foreign language,\r\n\nand  an  expert  in that  foreign  language  or  code is  not\r\n\nreasonably   available   during   the  interception   period,\r\n\nminimization may be accomplished as soon as practicable after\r\n\nsuch  interception.\").   Although the  above-quoted statutory\r\n\nprovision  was  not   yet  effective  at  the   time  of  the\r\n\ninterceptions  here  at issue  (it  was passed  prior  to the\r\n\ninterceptions but went into effect thereafter), its existence\r\n\nas  pending legislation  renders  objectively reasonable  the\r\n\ngovernment's  policy  --  which  tracked  the legislation  --\r\n\nregarding intercepted conversations carried out in Spanish.\r\n\n          This was a  complex case involving  a sophisticated\r\n\ndefendant,  complicated  financial  dealings,  and  links  to\r\n\norganized crime.  In view of this, we  cannot say that either\r\n\nthe  complained-of  minimization  precautions  or  the  other\r\n\nminimization precautions  ordered by  the court and  taken by\r\n\nthe  government were  so  lacking in  thoroughness that  they\r\n\nviolated Title III. \r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\n          We    therefore   reject    London's   minimization\r\n\narguments.\r\n\n          5.

We have interpreted  this \"necessity\"\r\n\nprovision to mean that  the statement should demonstrate that\r\n\nthe government has  made \"a reasonable, good faith  effort to\r\n\nrun  the gamut  of  normal  investigative  procedures  before\r\n\nresorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of\r\n\ntelephone calls.\"   United States v. Hoffman,  832 F.2d 1299,\r                                                        \r\n\n1306-07 (1st Cir. 1987).  London argues that the government's\r\n\napplication misled the  court as to  the need for  electronic\r\n\nsurveillance by  failing to  mention that the  government had\r\n\nnot engaged  in the following investigative  techniques:  (1)\r\n\nsubpoenaing   London's  bank   records;  (2)   utilizing  two\r\n\nconfidential informants -- Francis  McIntyre and John DeMarco\r\n\n--  allegedly available  to  it; and  (3) placing  undercover\r\n\nagents  inside   of  Heller's.    London's   claims  are  not\r\n\nconvincing.\r\n\n          The  first   and  third  of   London's  claims  are\r\n\ndifficult  to  fathom,  as  the  affidavit  attached  to  the\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\ninterception application indicated  both that the  government\r\n\ndid  review  London's  bank  records  (during   an  unrelated\r               \r\n\ninvestigation) prior to applying for the interception  orders\r\n\nand  that undercover  infiltration was not  available because\r\n\n\"surveillance observations  have disclosed  a high degree  of\r\n\nconsciousness by London and others to the possibility  of law\r\n\nenforcement scrutiny\" and because  London \"requires two known\r\n\nreferences prior  to engaging in illegal  transactions with a\r\n\nperson.\"   Other  than  making the  general and  unpersuasive\r\n\nargument that \"visual surveillance by undercover agents\"  was\r                                                                         \r\n\npossible because Heller's \"was fully accessible to the public\r\n\neye\" and had no \"back rooms,\" London has not taken issue with\r\n\nthe  affidavit statements.   See  supra at  21 (noting,  in a\r                                                   \r\n\ndifferent context, London's failure to rebut the government's\r\n\nexplanation  why   undercover  agents  could   not  insinuate\r\n\nthemselves  into  Heller's).     And  he  certainly  has  not\r\n\nexplained how  the affidavit statements  themselves may  have\r\n\nbeen misleading.   We consequently  see no factual  basis for\r\n\nLondon's first and third claims. \r\n\n          As to  the claim  that the  government misleadingly\r\n\nfailed to  disclose the availability of  McIntyre and DeMarco\r\n\nas  informants, London  has not even  attempted to  rebut, by\r\n\npointing to contrary evidence, the district  court's findings\r\n\nthat, at the time of the initial application,  the government\r\n\nreasonably believed  (1)  that  McIntyre  would  not  testify\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nagainst  London;  and   (2)  that  DeMarco's   \"investigatory\r\n\npotential  . .  . [was]  immaterial  to the  investigation at\r\n\nHeller's.\"   In  light  of this,  we  cannot say  that  these\r\n\nfindings  are  clearly  erroneous.    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSchiavo, 29 F.3d  6, 8 (1st Cir. 1994) (findings of fact made\r                   \r\n\nafter suppression hearing reviewed for clear error).  And the\r\n\nfindings  plainly  undermine  London's  contention  that  the\r\n\nfailure   to  disclose   McIntyre's  and   DeMarco's  alleged\r\n\ninvestigatory potential violated 18 U.S.C.   2815(1)(c).\r\n\n          We  therefore reject  London's  argument  that  the\r\n\ngovernment  misled the  district court  as to  necessity when\r\n\napplying for the initial interception orders.\r\n\nB.

He  characterizes as  unconstitutionally\r\n\noverbroad the  warrant's description  of items to  be seized:\r\n\n\"books  and records,  ledgers, correspondence,  notes, slips,\r\n\nchecks and any other documents, including bank records, which\r\n\nreflect    unlawful    gambling,   loansharking,    narcotics\r\n\ndistribution,  and  failure   to  file  currency  transaction\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nreports;  and  U.S. currency  which  constitutes  proceeds of\r\n\nthese offenses.\"    He also  argues  that the  officials  who\r\n\nexecuted  the  search  could  not have  held  an  objectively\r\n\nreasonable belief  that the overbroad language  in the search\r\n\nwarrant  was constitutional.   Because  we disagree  with the\r\n\nlatter of London's two arguments, we repudiate his assignment\r\n\nof errorwithout assessingthe constitutionality ofthe warrant.\r\n\n          It is well settled that \"suppression is appropriate\r\n\nonly if  the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing\r\n\n[the  warrant]  affidavit  or  could  not  have  harbored  an\r\n\nobjectively  reasonable belief  in the existence  of probable\r\n\ncause.\"  United  States v.

Nor has  he\r\n\nasserted that there was an absence of probable cause for some\r                                                                         \r\n\nsort  of warrant  to  have issued.    Assuming arguendo  that\r                                                                   \r\n\nLondon might still be  entitled to suppression without having\r\n\nmade any of  these arguments, our inquiry reduces  to whether\r\n\nthe  description  of  items  to be  seized  was  so  facially\r\n\ndefective that an  objectively reasonable officer would  have\r\n\nknown of the warrant's  unconstitutionality.  We hardly think\r\n\nso.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          Even if the description of items to be seized might\r\n\nhave been more particular, it was not patently overbroad when\r\n\nviewed  in  context.    London operated  a  complex  criminal\r\n\nenterprise  where  he   mingled  \"innocent\"  documents   with\r\n\napparently-innocent  documents  which, in  fact, memorialized\r\n\nillegal   transactions.     London   also  intermingled   his\r\n\nlegitimately-obtained and innocently-obtained  currency.   It\r\n\ntherefore would have been  difficult for the magistrate judge\r\n\nto be more limiting  in phrasing the warrant's language,  and\r\n\nfor the executing  officers to have  been more discerning  in\r\n\ndetermining what to seize.  In similar circumstances, we have\r\n\nstated: \r\n\n          We must . . . recognize that the inherent\r\n          difficulty  in  segregating  \"good\"  from\r\n          \"bad\"   records,   and  consequently   in\r\n          drawing up an adequately limited warrant,\r\n          makes it difficult  for even a reasonably\r\n          well-trained officer, who is not expected\r\n          to be a legal technician and  is entitled\r\n          to rely on  the greater sophistication of\r\n          the magistrate -- to know precisely where\r\n          to draw the line.\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Diaz,  841  F.2d  1,  6  (1st  Cir.  1988)\r                                   \r\n\n(overturning a suppression order based on an overbroad search\r\n\nwarrant).  Like Diaz, the question whether the description of\r                                \r\n\nitems to  be seized was unconstitutionally  overbroad was, at\r\n\nbest,  close,  and  the executing  officers  were objectively\r\n\nreasonable  in deferring  to the  magistrate judge's  trained\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\n          We therefore reject London's argument  that all the\r\n\nevidence  seized  during the  December  17,  1986, search  of\r\n\nHeller's should have been suppressed.\r\n\nC.  Jury Instructions Regarding London's Failure to File CTRs\r            C.  Jury Instructions Regarding London's Failure to File CTRs\r                                                                         \r\n\n          London argues that we should vacate his convictions\r\n\nfor  failing   to  file  CTRs  because   the  district  court\r\n\nerroneously informed the jury  that London could be convicted\r\n\nof the \"willful\" violation proscribed by 31  U.S.C.   5322(b)\r\n\nif he had  merely a  reckless disregard of  his legal  duties\r\n\nregarding  the  filing of  CTRs.   The  government  takes the\r\n\nposition  that  the court's  instructions  were incorrect  in\r\n\nlight  of Ratzlaf  v. United  States, 114  S. Ct.  655 (1994)\r                                                \r\n\n(knowledge of the illegality of one's actions is necessary to\r\n\nsustain  a  conviction  under  31  U.S.C.     5322)  (illegal\r\n\nstructuring case), an  opinion issued  after London's  trial,\r\n\nbut points to  London's failure to  object and contends  that\r\n\nthe instructions do not constitute plain error  under Fed.

In a recent decision, another\r\n\npanel of  this court  expressed doubt  as to  whether Ratzlaf\r                                                                         \r\n\noverruled Aversa's alternative  reckless disregard  standard.\r                            \r\n\nSee  United States  v. Saccoccia,  Nos. 93-1511/1560-63/1616-\r                                            \r\n\n17/2206-07 and 94-1388/1507-08, slip op. at 27 (1st Cir. July\r\n\n24, 1995).   But this  comment was only  dictum.  It  was not\r\n\nnecessary  to   the  Saccoccia  panel's   finding  that   the\r                                          \r\n\ninstruction   challenged  in   that  case  was   not  plainly\r                                                                         \r\n\nerroneous.  Id.  at 26-27 (noting the  defendant's failure to\r                           \r\n\nobject).   Nor  was it implicitly  or explicitly  relied upon\r\n\nwhen the panel held  the evidence sufficient for the  jury to\r\n\nhave  found   that  the  defendants  \"knew   that  their  own\r\n\nactivities  were  unlawful.\"   Id.  at 32-33.    The reckless\r                                              \r\n\ndisregard standard therefore played  no role in the Saccoccia\r                                                                         \r\n\ncourt's holding.  We therefore feel that the question whether\r                           \r\n\nRatzlaf  has  impliedly  left untouched  or  overruled Aversa\r                                                                         \r\n\nremains to be decided--if the issue has not been waived.\r\n\n          Addressing  the  waiver   issue  we  conclude  that\r\n\nLondon's   failure   to  object   was  excusable   under  the\r\n\ncircumstances  of this  case.   The  government argues  that,\r\n\ndespite the  recency of the  Aversa decision and  the overall\r                                               \r\n\nstate of the law at the time of his trial,  London has waived\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nany   argument  that  the  aforementioned  instructions  were\r\n\nerroneous.   While acknowledging  that waiver should  not \"be\r\n\ninferred, and  no plain error requirement  imposed, where [a]\r\n\nSupreme  Court[] ruling comes out  of the blue  and could not\r\n\nhave been anticipated,\"  see United States v.  Weiner, 3 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n17,  24 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993), the government contends that the\r\n\nsplit  between  this and  the other  ten  circuits as  to the\r\n\nmeaning of willfulness under 31 U.S.C.   5322 \"made it likely\r\n\nthat  the issue would be  resolved by the  Supreme Court\" and\r\n\nmade it incumbent upon  London to lodge an objection.   In so\r\n\ndoing, the government relies on our recent decision in United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Marder, 48 F.3d 564 (1st Cir.)

Ct.  1441  (1995),  where we\r                                 \r\n\nindicated that  defendant Marder's failure  to object to  a  \r\n\n5322  willfulness  instruction  given  prior to  Ratzlaf  was\r                                                                    \r\n\ninexcusable.  Id.  at 572 n.5.   Marder is not  on-point, and\r                                                   \r\n\nthe government's argument is not persuasive.\r\n\n          As an initial matter, Marder's trial occurred prior\r\n\nto our decision  in Aversa.   Thus,  the compelling  scenario\r                                      \r\n\npresented here -- instructions  mirroring exactly the holding\r\n\nof  a recent en banc opinion of the controlling circuit court\r                                \r\n\n--  did not exist in  that case.   More importantly, however,\r\n\nMarder's   trial   judge,   without  objection,   erroneously\r\n\ninstructed the jury in  accordance with the law in  the other\r\n\ncircuits  (i.e., that knowledge of the reporting requirements\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nwas all that  was needed  to establish  willfulness under  31\r\n\nU.S.C.   5322) despite (1) the existence of authority in this\r                                                                         \r\n\ncircuit indicating that knowledge of illegality was necessary\r\n\nto establish willfulness under   5322, see Marder, 48 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n572 n.5 (citing Bank of New  England, 821 F.2d 844, 854  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied 484 U.S. 943 (1987))); and (2) our recent\r                               \r\n\nwithdrawal of an  on-point panel opinion and decision to hear\r\n\nthe  Aversa  case  en  banc,  see  id.

As we have explained, the law of\r                                      \r\n\nthis circuit was settled by nothing less  than a newly-minted\r\n\nen  banc  opinion  at the  time  the  trial  judge instructed\r                    \r\n\nLondon's  jury.  This fact alone goes  a long way, if not the\r\n\nwhole  way,  towards  excusing London's  failure  to  object.\r\n\nMoreover, at this same time, all eleven circuits had at least\r\n\nimplicitly  indicated  that  a  reckless disregard  of  legal\r\n\nduties  regarding  the  filing  of  CTRs  was  sufficient  to\r\n\nestablish  willfulness under 31 U.S.C.    5322.  See Ratzlaf,\r                                                                        \r\n\n114 S.

We  therefore  must proceed  to our\r                                  \r\n\ninterpretation of the scope of Ratzlaf.\r                                                  \r\n\n          In Ratzlaf the trial court instructed the jury that\r                                \r\n\nit  could convict  even  if it  found  the defendant  had  no\r\n\nknowledge of the anti-structuring  statute but acted with the\r\n\npurpose of circumventing a  bank's reporting obligation.  The\r\n\nCourt stated:\r\n\n          We    hold    that   the    \"willfulness\"\r\n          requirement mandates something more.

While we\r\n\nmight, if  writing  on a  clean slate,  accept the  narrowest\r\n\ninterpretation  of \"knowledge,\" we  will not  easily conclude\r\n\nthat the Court has  rejected our prior decision  by ambiguous\r\n\ninference  or opaque implication.   We would  require a clear\r\n\nsignal.\r\n\n          We now  look for  signals.   The  case for  \"actual\r\n\nknowledge\"   is  the   word  itself   --  expressing   direct\r\n\nacquaintance  with a fact.  This has the virtue of simplicity\r\n\nin formulating instructions  to a  jury.  We  note, too,  the\r\n\nfact  that the prosecution  in our  case conceded  error, but\r\n\nthis does not relieve us of  our obligation to make a de novo\r\n\ndecision.  We do take cognizance that in Ratzlaf, the Court's\r                                                            \r\n\nreferences to Aversa  were on points other than  the equation\r                                \r\n\nof reckless disregard and knowledge-willfulness.  And we also\r\n\ntake  note  of  the  majority's  failure  to  respond  to the\r\n\ndissent's  charge  that  the  Court's  decision repealed  the\r\n\n\"reckless disregard\" standard of Aversa.\r                                                   \r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\n          Looking  for contrary  indications, we  note first,\r\n\nthat  the  referent   used  most  often  by  the   Court  was\r\n\n\"knowledge.\"   \"Actual  knowledge\" was  used by  the majority\r\n\nonly  once,  in a  parenthetical  reference to  a  1980 Fifth\r\n\nCircuit case.   114  S.

On the other  hand,\r                  \r\n\nRatzlaf  cites to a number of other cases requiring less than\r                   \r\n\nactual knowledge.  See, e.g., id.

See id.  We do not ascribe to the\r                                               \r\n\nmajority's  failure to take up the  gauntlet on the dissent's\r\n\nthrust on Aversa as deliberate decision making.\r                            \r\n\n          But beyond comments in  the Court's opinion, we are\r\n\nmindful of  the wider scope given  definitions of \"knowledge\"\r\n\nin  cases and statutes.   For example, the  cases applying 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    656 (bank  officer who \"willfully  misapplies\" bank\r\n\nfunds) have  generally held  reckless disregard  to establish\r\n\nthe requisite intent to defraud.1  These holdings come  close\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We have  so held in United  States v. Cyr, 712  F.2d 729,\r                                                         \r\n732 (1st Cir. 1983), and in United States v.

Other  circuits equate  intent to\r\ninjure  the  bank  with  reckless  disregard  of  the  bank's\r\ninterest.   See, e.g., United States v. Hoffman, 918 F.2d 44,\r                                                           \r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nto  equating,  if  not  precisely  doing  so,  knowledge  and\r\n\nreckless disregard.  We  can make the same comment  about the\r\n\nSupreme Court precedents equating the two concepts in various\r\n\nfederal statutes.   See McLaughlin v. Richland  Shoe Co., 486\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S.  128,  133  (1988)   (\"willfulness\"  under  Fair   Labor\r\n\nStandards Act means defendant \"either knew or showed reckless\r\n\ndisregard  for   the  matter  of  whether   its  conduct  was\r\n\nprohibited by the statute\"); Transworld Airlines v.

Seizing  upon the  highlighted\r\n\nlanguage,  London   contends  that  there   was  insufficient\r\n\nevidence that he conducted his check-cashing business with an\r\n\nintent to promote the  unspecified unlawful activity at issue\r\n\n-- i.e., illegal gambling.  We disagree.\r\n\n          There  was overwhelming evidence that London failed\r\n\nto file CTRs prior to the December 17, 1986, execution of the\r\n\nsearch  warrant at Heller's, and that London was aware of the\r\n\nreporting requirements  during the period in  which he failed\r\n\nto  file  CTRs.    There  also  was  evidence  that  London's\r\n\nunorthodox  operating  procedures  benefitted  his  bookmaker\r\n\ncustomers.   Finally,  there  was evidence  that London  made\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\nmoney with every check  he cashed.  Thus, there  was evidence\r\n\nthat London knowingly operated  his business in an unorthodox\r\n\nmanner  that  benefitted  both  his  bookmaker  customers and\r\n\n(derivatively) himself.  In our view, this evidence of mutual\r\n\ninterest is more than sufficient to sustain an inference that\r\n\nLondon operated his check-cashing business with the intent to\r\n\npromote the  illegal gambling businesses operated  by certain\r\n\nof his customers.\r\n\n          We  therefore reject  London's argument  that there\r\n\nwas  insufficient evidence  to  support his  money laundering\r\n\nconvictions.\r\n\n          2.

We do not  find these\r\n\narguments convincing.\r\n\n          London's first argument is legal.  The RICO statute\r\n\nstates  that the term  \"`enterprise' includes any individual,\r\n\npartnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity,\r\n\nand  any union  or group  of  individuals associated  in fact\r\n\nalthough  not a legal entity.\"   18 U.S.C.   1961(4).  London\r\n\ncontends that, under  a plain reading  of this provision,  an\r\n\nassociation-in-fact RICO  enterprise such as the  one alleged\r\n\nhere  must  be  an  association of  individuals,  and  cannot\r                                                           \r\n\ninclude legal entities.  \r\n\n          London's argument has been addressed to a number of\r\n\ncircuit  courts, and each has rejected it.  See, e.g., United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

See  Libertad v. Welch, 53 F.3d  428, 444\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).

See supra at 40-41.  We have not and do\r                                           \r\n\nnot  do  so today,  because even  if  we assume  arguendo the\r                                                                     \r\n\ntest's applicability,  there was ample evidence  for the jury\r\n\nto have found that its requirements were met.\r\n\n          The  jury could have found  that there was a common\r\n\nor shared  purpose animating both the  enterprise and London:\r\n\ndoing  commerce with (and  thereby profiting from) bookmakers\r\n\nengaged  in illegal gambling.  The evidence that London as an\r\n\nindividual pursued such a scheme is overwhelming and does not\r\n\nneed  repeating.   Moreover,  M &amp;  L  and Heller's  were  the\r\n\nprincipal means by  which London effectuated  his plan.   The\r\n\njury reasonably found that London used  M &amp; L to launder (for\r\n\na profit) the proceeds of illegal gambling for  his bookmaker\r\n\ncustomers,  and could  have found  that he  used  the privacy\r\n\nafforded by Heller's to shield M &amp;  L from close scrutiny, to\r\n\narrange meetings between Ferrara and his bookmaker customers,\r\n\nand to collect \"rent\" for Ferrara.\r\n\n          The jury also could  have found that the enterprise\r\n\nfunctioned  as a  continuing  unit and  had an  ascertainable\r\n\nstructure  distinct from  that inherent in  the conduct  of a\r\n\npattern  of racketeering activity.  As to the latter of these\r\n\ntwo requirements, M &amp; L and Heller's were legitimate entities\r\n\nthat did a significant amount of business completely separate\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\nfrom the pattern  of racketeering activity  at issue in  this\r\n\ncase.  Heller's was a bar where drinks and food were sold. \r\n\nM  &amp;  L was  a check-cashing  business  -- located  inside of\r\n\nHeller's and operated by the same individual who ran Heller's\r\n\n--  that  cashed checks  for customers  willing  to pay  it a\r\n\ncommission.   As to  the former  requirement, the jury  could\r\n\nreasonably  have surmised that M &amp; L and Heller's operated as\r\n\na symbiotic unit (M &amp; L  providing a ready source of cash for\r\n\nHeller's customers;  Heller's customers taking advantage of \r\n\nM  &amp; L's  convenience), and  that they  existed for  a common\r\n\npurpose:  the economic gain of London.\r\n\n          We  therefore reject  London's  argument  that  the\r\n\nBledsoe standard has not been met in this case.\r                   \r\n\n          London's third argument derives from  the fact that\r\n\n\"[w]e have consistently interpreted [RICO's] requirement that\r\n\na  culpable person be  `employed by  or associated  with' the\r\n\nRICO  enterprise as  meaning that  the same entity  cannot do\r\n\ndouble  duty  as  both  the  RICO   defendant  and  the  RICO\r\n\nenterprise.\"  Miranda  v. Ponce  Fed. Bank, 948  F.2d 41,  44\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (quoting  18 U.S.C.   1962(c)).   He contends\r\n\nthat he, the  defendant named in  the indictment, is  legally\r\n\nindistinguishable from M &amp; L and Heller's.  \r\n\n          His argument overlooks the fact that M &amp;  L, though\r\n\na  sole proprietorship, had at  least one employee other than\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\nhimself, and the fact that Heller's  was incorporated and had\r\n\nseveral employees other than himself.  No more is required to\r\n\nestablish the separateness required by RICO.  As Judge Posner\r\n\nexplained in responding to a similar argument:\r\n\n          If the one-man band incorporates, it gets\r\n          some legal protections from the corporate\r\n          form, such  as limited liability;  and it\r\n          is  just this  sort  of legal  shield for\r\n          illegal  activity  that  RICO   tries  to\r\n          pierce.   A one-man  band  that does  not\r\n          incorporate,  that  merely operates  as a\r\n          proprietorship,     gains     no    legal\r\n          protections from the form in which it has\r\n          chosen to  do business;  the man  and the\r\n          proprietorship really are the same entity\r\n          in  law and  fact.   But  if the  man has\r\n          employees  or associates,  the enterprise\r\n          is distinct from  him, and it then  makes\r\n          no difference, so far as we can see, what\r\n          legal form  the  enterprise takes.    The\r\n          only important thing is that it be either\r\n          formally (as when there is incorporation)\r\n          or practically (as when there  are people\r\n          besides  the  proprietor  working in  the\r\n          organization)    separable    from    the\r\n          individual.\r\n\nMcCullough v. Suter, 757 F.2d 142, 144 (7th Cir. 1985).\r                               \r\n\n          We therefore  reject London's argument that  he and\r\n\nthe  RICO enterprise  alleged in  the indictment  are legally\r\n\nindistinguishable.            \r\n\n                             -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\n          3.

We  need not\r\n\nand do  not reach  this argument.   As we  have pointed  out,\r\n\nLondon's RICO convictions are sustainable  so long as we  can\r\n\ntell with certainty that the jury found that he committed two\r\n\nsufficient predicate acts.  See supra at 39 (quoting Angiulo,\r                                                                        \r\n\n897 F.2d at  1198).   Here, the jury  sustainably found  that\r\n\nLondon committed numerous predicate acts of money laundering.\r\n\nThus,  even if there were no nexus between the enterprise and\r\n\nthe racketeering acts involving  extortion and the collection\r\n\nof illegal debt (an issue on which we express no opinion), we\r\n\nwould sustain London's RICO convictions.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n          For   the  reasons  stated,  the  judgment  of  the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                              affirmed\r                                      \r\n\n                             -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n",

After carefully considering the parties' arguments,\r\n\nwe affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\nA.  Factual Background\r            A.  Factual Background\r                                  \r\n\n          London operated Heller's Cafe (\"Heller's), a bar in\r\n\nChelsea, Massachusetts.  He also ran a check-cashing service,\r\n\nknown as M  &amp; L Associates (\"M &amp; L\"), out of a small enclosed\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\narea  in the bar.  M  &amp; L charged its customers  a 1% or 1.5%\r\n\ncommission on each check cashed.  Both Heller's and M &amp; L had\r\n\nat least one employee other than London.\r\n\n          The  evidence at trial demonstrated that bookmakers\r\n\ntended to  frequent Heller's and  to use  M &amp; L  as a  check-\r\n\ncashing service.   Sometimes, M  &amp; L cashed  bookmaker checks\r\n\nthat banks would not  accept.  For example, some  checks were\r\n\nneither  made  out  by  nor  payable  to the  bookmakers  (or\r\n\nbookmakers' agents)  who were cashing them.  Others were made\r\n\nout either to fictitious names or to real persons or entities\r\n\nwho  were not  to receive  the funds.   London  neither asked\r\n\nabout the names on the checks he cashed nor required that the\r\n\nchecks be  endorsed.  And before December 17, 1986 -- the day\r\n\non  which  federal  agents   executed  a  search  warrant  at\r\n\nHeller's,  see infra  at  6  --  London  never  filed  a  CTR\r                                \r\n\nnotifying the  Internal Revenue  Service (\"IRS\") of  his many\r\n\ncurrency transactions  involving more  than $10,000.   See 31\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.    5313(a) (requiring financial institutions to report\r\n\ncurrency  transactions   in  the  manner  prescribed  by  the\r\n\nSecretary  of  the Treasury)  and  31  C.F.R.    103.11(i)(3)\r                                             \r\n\n(check-casher  is a  financial institution)  and 31  C.F.R.  \r                                                            \r\n\n103.22(a)(1) (financial institutions must report all currency\r\n\ntransactions involving more than $10,000 to the IRS). \r\n\n          London's operating  procedures were a  boon to  his\r\n\nbookmaker  customers.   Not  only  did  London provide  these\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ncustomers with an immediate and untraceable source of cash to\r\n\npay their various expenses (including gamblers' winnings), he\r\n\nenabled  them  to accept  checks  from  their own  customers.\r\n\nThis, in turn, increased business volume, for the ability  to\r\n\npay  gambling  debts by  check  encouraged  gamblers to  make\r\n\nlarger and more  frequent bets.  It  also made it easier  for\r\n\nout-of-state gamblers  to do business with  local bookmakers,\r\n\nand possible  for  some gamblers  to pay  debts with  company\r\n\nfunds  (and thereby gamble with  money on which  they paid no\r\n\ntaxes).\r\n\n          London's  promotion of bookmaking often took a more\r\n\nactive form.  In 1986, London operated a bookmaking operation\r\n\nwith  one Kenny  Miller.   He  also  helped run  one  Dominic\r\n\nIsabella's  bookmaking  operation  while  Isabella  was  ill.\r\n\nFinally, London acted as a \"pay and collect\" man for  many of\r\n\nhis bookmaker customers, making payments to  winning gamblers\r\n\nand collecting payments from losers.\r\n\n          London also assisted Vincent Ferrara, the leader of\r\n\nan  organized   crime  group,  in  collecting  \"rent\"  (i.e.,\r\n\nprotection money) from bookmakers.  London identified certain\r\n\nof his bookmaker customers to Ferrara, telling him \"anybody I\r\n\nget  you  get.\"    London  then  summoned  the  bookmakers to\r\n\nHeller's to meet with Ferrara, who demanded that they pay him\r\n\nanywhere  from  $500  to  $1000  (or  more)  per   month  for\r\n\n\"protection\" and  help in debt collection.   London collected\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nrent  payments and, at least once, passed along a request for\r\n\ndebt  collection assistance  from  a bookmaker  who had  been\r\n\ninduced to accept Ferrara's protection.\r\n\n          As stated above, London never filed a CTR with  the\r\n\nIRS  prior  to  the  execution   of  the  search  warrant  on\r\n\nDecember 17,  1986.     From   December  18,   1986,  through\r\n\nDecember 31, 1988, however, he filed 211 CTR's on behalf of M\r\n\n&amp;  L.  Although London  had instructed his  customers to make\r\n\ncertain that each check was for less than $10,000, London did\r\n\ncash  individual checks  that  were in  amounts greater  than\r\n\n$10,000.   When  he cashed  a group  of checks  for the  same\r\n\ncustomer, London would often  deposit the checks on different\r\n\ndays or in  different bank accounts.   There was  testimonial\r\n\nevidence tending  to indicate  that London  was aware  of the\r\n\nstatutory  and regulatory  reporting requirements  during the\r\n\nperiod in which he failed to file any CTRs with the IRS.\r\n\nB.  Procedural History\r            B.  Procedural History\r                                  \r\n\n          On October 28, 1986,  in response to an application\r\n\nand affidavit  made pursuant to an  on-going investigation of\r\n\nLondon,  his businesses,  and  his  associates, the  district\r\n\ncourt issued two orders authorizing the government to conduct\r\n\nelectronic  surveillance  at  Heller's.     The  first  order\r\n\nauthorized, for a thirty-day period, the interception of oral\r\n\ncommunications in and adjacent to the enclosed area  in which\r\n\nM  &amp; L operated; the second authorized, also for a thirty-day\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nperiod, the  recording of  wire communications made  from two\r\n\ntelephones  located behind the bar.  In order to minimize the\r\n\ninterception  of otherwise  non-interceptable communications,\r\n\nthe court's  orders limited surveillance to  times when named\r\n\ntargets of the  investigation were on Heller's  premises.  On\r\n\nDecember 3, 1986, the  court extended each of the  orders for\r\n\nan  additional  thirty days.    Evidence  derived from  these\r\n\ninterceptions was introduced against London at trial.\r\n\n          On December  17, 1986, federal agents  applied to a\r\n\nmagistrate  judge for  a warrant  authorizing them  to search\r\n\nHeller's for  evidence  of unlawful  gambling,  loansharking,\r\n\ndistribution of narcotics, money  laundering, and failure  to\r\n\nfile  CTRs.    The   magistrate  judge  issued  the  warrant,\r\n\nauthorizing  the  agents  to  search  \"Heller's  Cafe,  which\r\n\noccupies the first floor and basement of 110 Chestnut Street\"\r\n\nand to  seize  \"books and  records, ledgers,  correspondence,\r\n\nnotes, slips, checks and  any other documents, including bank\r\n\nrecords,  which  reflect  unlawful   gambling,  loansharking,\r\n\nnarcotics   distribution,  and   failure  to   file  currency\r\n\ntransaction  reports;  and  U.S.  currency  which constitutes\r\n\nproceeds of these offenses.\"  The agents executed the warrant\r\n\nlater that day,  and seized,  inter alia, almost  all of  the\r                                                    \r\n\nrecords found in the enclosed area from which M &amp; L operated.\r\n\nEvidence  seized in the course of  this search was introduced\r\n\nagainst London at trial.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          On April 11, 1990, a federal  grand jury returned a\r\n\ntwo-count indictment charging London with income tax evasion.\r\n\nOn  May 10, 1990, the  grand jury returned  a fifty-one count\r\n\nsuperseding  indictment charging London with, inter alia, the\r                                                                    \r\n\ncounts  of conviction:    one count  of  RICO conspiracy,  18\r\n\nU.S.C.    1962(d); one count of RICO substantive, 18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1962(c);  twelve  counts of  money  laundering,  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1956(a)(1); twelve counts of failing to file  CTRs, 31 U.S.C.\r\n\n    5313(a) and  5322(b); one  count of conspiring  to commit\r\n\nextortion,  18  U.S.C.     1951;  two counts  of  aiding  and\r\n\nabetting extortion, 18 U.S.C.    2 and 1951; and one count of\r\n\ntax evasion  for  tax  year  1985, 26  U.S.C.     7201.    On\r\n\nSeptember  5,   1991,  the  grand  jury   returned  a  second\r\n\nsuperseding  indictment which  charged  no  new offenses  but\r\n\nbrought  the  indictment within  the  purview  of the  United\r\n\nStates Sentencing  Guidelines by extending the  period of the\r\n\nalleged RICO conspiracy to after November 1987.\r\n\n          On August  17,  1992,  the  district  court  orally\r\n\ndenied  London's  previously-filed  motion  to  suppress  the\r\n\nevidence  seized  during the  December  17,  1986, search  of\r\n\nHeller's.  On  August 18,  1992, the court  issued a  written\r\n\nmemorandum and order denying London's previously-filed motion\r\n\nto suppress the fruits of the electronic surveillance.\r\n\n          Trial commenced  on January 4,  1993, and concluded\r\n\non February 19,  1993, when the jury returned guilty verdicts\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\non the counts of  conviction listed above.  The  other counts\r\n\ncontained in  the  second superseding  indictment either  had\r\n\nbeen  dismissed by  the  government prior  to  trial or  were\r\n\ndismissed by the district  court at trial.  In  addition, the\r\n\njury acquitted London on one money laundering count.  On June\r\n\n30,  1993, the district court sentenced  London.  This appeal\r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n          As  set forth  above, London's  appellate arguments\r\n\nfall  into three main groups.  First, London takes issue with\r\n\nthe district  court's  denial  of  his  suppression  motions.\r\n\nSecond,  London  challenges  the jury  instructions  given in\r\n\nconnection  with   the  counts  of  the   second  superseding\r\n\nindictment charging  him with failing  to file CTRs.   Third,\r\n\nLondon  makes  sundry arguments  that there  was insufficient\r\n\nevidence  to   support   his  money   laundering   and   RICO\r\n\nconvictions.  We discuss each of London's arguments in turn.\r\n\nA.   Denial  of the  Motion  to Suppress  the  Fruits of  the\r            A.   Denial  of the  Motion  to Suppress  the  Fruits of  the\r                                                                         \r\nElectronic Surveillance\r            Electronic Surveillance\r                                   \r\n\n          London  contends that the  district court  erred in\r\n\ndenying  his motion to suppress  the fruits of the electronic\r\n\nsurveillance conducted at Heller's in  1986.  He claims  that\r\n\nthe aforementioned surveillance ran afoul of Title III of the\r\n\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n   2510 et  seq. (\"Title  III\") -- the  federal statute  that\r                            \r\n\ngoverns  electronic surveillance  -- in  five ways:   (1)  no\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nDepartment  of Justice  official  designated in  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n2516(1) had  authorized the  local United States  Attorney to\r\n\napply  for the  initial interception  orders; (2)  the orders\r\n\nimproperly  allowed the  government to  monitor conversations\r\n\nrelating to  money laundering, which  was not an  offense for\r\n\nwhich  interception  could  be   ordered,  see  18  U.S.C.   \r                                                          \r\n\n2516(1)(a)-(o), on  the date the interception  orders issued;\r\n\n(3)  the  government  intercepted  and  disclosed  extortion-\r\n\nrelated  conversations  --  conversations pertaining  to  the\r\n\npaying  of \"rent\"  to  Ferrara --  beyond  the scope  of  the\r\n\ncourt's  orders; (4)  the  court ordered  and the  government\r\n\nemployed inadequate minimization procedures under 18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2518(5);  and (5)  the  government's  application misled  the\r\n\ndistrict court as to  the necessity for conducting electronic\r\n\nsurveillance,  in  violation  of  18   U.S.C.     2518(1)(c).\r\n\nBecause  we are not persuaded  by any of  these arguments, we\r\n\naffirm the district court's denial of the suppression motion.\r\n\n          1.

As\r                                     \r\n\nnoted,   London  contends   that  the   initial  interception\r\n\napplication  was not  authorized by  a statutorily-designated\r\n\nJustice Department official.  London is mistaken.  \r\n\n          The government attached to its initial interception\r\n\napplication  the  first  page  of  a  two-page  authorization\r\n\nmemorandum prepared on October 24, 1986, by  William F. Weld,\r\n\nthen the Justice Department's Assistant Attorney  General for\r\n\nthe  Criminal  Division, and  the  second page  of  the cover\r\n\nletter which  accompanied  the  Weld  memorandum,  which  was\r\n\nsigned   for  Weld   by  Frederick   D.  Hess,   the  Justice\r\n\nDepartment's Director of the Office of Enforcement Operations\r\n\nof the Criminal  Division.  It is undisputed that  Weld was a\r\n\nstatutorily-designated  official  and  Hess  was   not.    In\r\n\nrejecting  London's  suppression motion,  the  district court\r\n\nfound that  Weld had authorized  the interception application\r\n\n(as  the application  had  stated) and  that \"the  government\r\n\ncommitted a collating error by providing page one of the Weld\r\n\napproval letter  followed by  page two of  a separate  letter\r\n\nwritten  by Hess  to Robert  S. Mueller,  III, Acting  United\r\n\nStates Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.\"\r\n\n          London  does  not  dispute  the  accuracy   of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  \"collating  error\"  finding;  nor  does he\r\n\ndisagree that  the finding would validate  the application if\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nthe district court was  empowered to look beyond the  face of\r\n\nthe  application in  deciding whether  there had  been proper\r\n\nauthorization.

What  it neglects  to take  into\r\n\naccount, however, is that  Weld signed the first page,  which\r                                           \r\n\nstates at the top  that it is a  memorandum from \"William  F.\r\n\nWeld,   Assistant   Attorney  General,   Criminal  Division.\"\r\n\nFurthermore, that same first  page clearly indicates that the\r\n\nAssistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division\r\n\n(i.e., Weld) authorized the application:\r\n\n               By virtue of the authority vested in\r\n          him by  Section 2516 of Title  18, United\r\n          States  Code, the Attorney General of the\r\n          United States  has by Order  Number 1088-\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          85,  dated  March  28,   1985,  specially\r\n          designated the Assistant Attorney General\r\n          in charge  of  the Criminal  Division  to\r\n          authorize  applications for  court orders\r\n          authorizing the interception  of wire  or\r\n          oral   communication.      As  the   duly\r\n          appointed  Assistant Attorney  General in\r\n          charge  of  the  Criminal Division,  this\r\n          power  is exercisable by  me.  WHEREFORE,\r\n          acting  under  this  delegated  power,  I\r\n          hereby   authorize  the   above-described\r\n          [London]  application to  be made  by any\r\n          investigative or  law enforcement officer\r\n          of  the  United   States  as  defined  in\r\n          Section  2510(7)  of  Title   18,  United\r\n          States Code.\r\n\nFinally, nothing in  the text  of either page  of the  papers\r\n\npresented to  the district court even  remotely suggests that\r\n\nHess, and not Weld, authorized the application.  \r\n\n          We  therefore  reject  London's  argument  that the\r\n\ninitial  interception application  was  not authorized  by  a\r\n\nstatutorily-designated Justice Department official.\r\n\n          2.  Interception of Conversations Relating to\r                      2.  Interception of Conversations Relating to\r                                                                   \r\n          Money Laundering\r                      Money Laundering\r                                      \r\n\n          Title  III  specifies  the  offenses  for  which an\r\n\ninterception order  may issue.   18 U.S.C.    2516(1)(a)-(o).\r\n\nMoney  laundering in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    1956  was so\r\n\nspecified by  legislation that  became effective  October 27,\r\n\n1986.  Pub. L. 99-570, Title I,   1365(c), Oct. 27, 1986, 100\r\n\nStat. 3207-35.   As  noted,  London argues  that the  initial\r\n\ninterception   orders   authorized   the    interception   of\r\n\nconversations relating to money  laundering prior to the date\r\n\non  which money laundering was added to 18 U.S.C.   2516(1)'s\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nlist  of offenses.    Even if  we  assume arguendo  that  the\r                                                              \r\n\ninitial interception orders did authorize the interception of\r\n\nconversations relating to money laundering in violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.      1956  (a  position  with   which  the  government\r\n\nforcefully  disagrees  and on  which  we  take no  position),\r\n\nLondon's argument lacks a factual basis.\r\n\n           London  claims that  the district  court's initial\r\n\ninterception orders  issued on  October 24, 1986,  three days\r\n\nbefore money  laundering became a predicate  offense under 18\r\n\nU.S.C.     2516(1).   The record  reveals, however,  that the\r\n\ninitial interception  orders issued on October  28, 1986, not\r\n\nOctober  24, 1986.  Thus, money laundering in violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    1956 was an offense for which an interception order\r                              \r\n\ncould issue  at the time  of the initial  interception orders\r\n\nissued in this case.\r\n\n          We  therefore reject  London's  argument  that  the\r\n\ninitial  interception orders  authorized the  interception of\r\n\nconversations  relating to  money laundering  at a  time when\r\n\nmoney laundering was not a predicate  offense under 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  2516(1).\r\n\n          3.    Interception  and  Disclosure  of  Extortion-\r                      3.    Interception  and  Disclosure  of  Extortion-\r                                                                         \r\n\nRelated\r            Related\r                   \r\n          Conversations\r                      Conversations\r                                   \r\n\n          With  certain exceptions,  Title III  prohibits the\r\n\ninterception and disclosure of conversations other than those\r\n\nrelating to  the offenses  specified in the  district court's\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\ninterception order.  See  generally 18 U.S.C.     2511, 2517,\r                                               \r\n\nand  2518(4)(c).  As noted, London argues that the government\r\n\nwrongfully  intercepted  and  disclosed   certain  extortion-\r\n\nrelated  conversations  (i.e.,  conversations concerning  the\r\n\npaying  of  \"rent\" to  Ferrara)  despite  the fact  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court's initial interception  orders did not specify\r\n\nextortion  in violation  of  18 U.S.C.     1951 as  a  target\r\n\noffense.  London's claim of governmental overreaching in this\r\n\ncontext is without merit.\r\n\n          Unlike  London's first  two arguments,  the instant\r\n\none  is not built upon  a faulty factual  basis; extortion in\r\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   1951 was not a target offense listed\r\n\nin the government's interception applications or the district\r\n\ncourt's interception  orders.  This fact  alone, though, does\r\n\nnot  make  the  interception  of   the  \"rent\"  conversations\r\n\nunlawful.     Title   III  clearly   contemplates  that   law\r\n\nenforcement  officials will,  in  the course  of intercepting\r\n\nconversations related to specified target offenses, intercept\r\n\nconversations   \"relating  to   offenses  other   than  those\r\n\nspecified in the order of authorization or approval.\"  See 18\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.    2517(5).  For example,  an intercepted conversation\r\n\ncan  relate to both a specified offense and to an unspecified\r                                                       \r\n\noffense.  In  such a situation, the  interception is unlawful\r\n\nonly  when it  is motivated  by an  illicit purpose  -- e.g.,\r\n\n\"subterfuge\"  interceptions where  the government  applies to\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nintercept conversations relating to offenses  specified in 18\r\n\nU.S.C.       2516(a)-(o)   while   intending   to   intercept\r\n\nconversations  relating to  offenses for  which interceptions\r\n\nare unauthorized or  for which  it has no  probable cause  to\r\n\nobtain an interception order.   See United States v. Angiulo,\r                                                                        \r\n\n847 F.2d 956,980 (1st Cir.), cert.denied, 488 U.S. 852(1988).\r                                                    \r\n\n           Here, the intercepted \"rent\" conversations clearly\r\n\nrelated to  at  least one  offense  -- operating  a  gambling\r\n\nbusiness in violation of 18 U.S.C.   1955 -- specified in the\r\n\ninitial   authorization  orders.      The  victims   of   the\r\n\nrent/extortion scheme  were  bookmakers involved  in  illegal\r\n\ngambling, and  the intercepted conversations provided a means\r\n\nof   identifying  them.     Moreover,   the  district   court\r\n\nsupportably found  that there  was no subterfuge  involved in\r\n\nthe initial interception applications.

Although the  above-quoted statutory\r\n\nprovision  was  not   yet  effective  at  the   time  of  the\r\n\ninterceptions  here  at issue  (it  was passed  prior  to the\r\n\ninterceptions but went into effect thereafter), its existence\r\n\nas  pending legislation  renders  objectively reasonable  the\r\n\ngovernment's  policy  --  which  tracked  the legislation  --\r\n\nregarding intercepted conversations carried out in Spanish.\r\n\n          This was a  complex case involving  a sophisticated\r\n\ndefendant,  complicated  financial  dealings,  and  links  to\r\n\norganized crime.  In view of this, we  cannot say that either\r\n\nthe  complained-of  minimization  precautions  or  the  other\r\n\nminimization precautions  ordered by  the court and  taken by\r\n\nthe  government were  so  lacking in  thoroughness that  they\r\n\nviolated Title III. \r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\n          We    therefore   reject    London's   minimization\r\n\narguments.\r\n\n          5.

London argues that the government's\r\n\napplication misled the  court as to  the need for  electronic\r\n\nsurveillance by  failing to  mention that the  government had\r\n\nnot engaged  in the following investigative  techniques:  (1)\r\n\nsubpoenaing   London's  bank   records;  (2)   utilizing  two\r\n\nconfidential informants -- Francis  McIntyre and John DeMarco\r\n\n--  allegedly available  to  it; and  (3) placing  undercover\r\n\nagents  inside   of  Heller's.    London's   claims  are  not\r\n\nconvincing.\r\n\n          The  first   and  third  of   London's  claims  are\r\n\ndifficult  to  fathom,  as  the  affidavit  attached  to  the\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\ninterception application indicated  both that the  government\r\n\ndid  review  London's  bank  records  (during   an  unrelated\r               \r\n\ninvestigation) prior to applying for the interception  orders\r\n\nand  that undercover  infiltration was not  available because\r\n\n\"surveillance observations  have disclosed  a high degree  of\r\n\nconsciousness by London and others to the possibility  of law\r\n\nenforcement scrutiny\" and because  London \"requires two known\r\n\nreferences prior  to engaging in illegal  transactions with a\r\n\nperson.\"   Other  than  making the  general and  unpersuasive\r\n\nargument that \"visual surveillance by undercover agents\"  was\r                                                                         \r\n\npossible because Heller's \"was fully accessible to the public\r\n\neye\" and had no \"back rooms,\" London has not taken issue with\r\n\nthe  affidavit statements.   See  supra at  21 (noting,  in a\r                                                   \r\n\ndifferent context, London's failure to rebut the government's\r\n\nexplanation  why   undercover  agents  could   not  insinuate\r\n\nthemselves  into  Heller's).     And  he  certainly  has  not\r\n\nexplained how  the affidavit statements  themselves may  have\r\n\nbeen misleading.   We consequently  see no factual  basis for\r\n\nLondon's first and third claims. \r\n\n          As to  the claim  that the  government misleadingly\r\n\nfailed to  disclose the availability of  McIntyre and DeMarco\r\n\nas  informants, London  has not even  attempted to  rebut, by\r\n\npointing to contrary evidence, the district  court's findings\r\n\nthat, at the time of the initial application,  the government\r\n\nreasonably believed  (1)  that  McIntyre  would  not  testify\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nagainst  London;  and   (2)  that  DeMarco's   \"investigatory\r\n\npotential  . .  . [was]  immaterial  to the  investigation at\r\n\nHeller's.\"   In  light  of this,  we  cannot say  that  these\r\n\nfindings  are  clearly  erroneous.    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSchiavo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195480\"><a href=\"/opinion/195480/united-states-v-schiavo/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 1994) (findings of fact made\r                   \r\n\nafter suppression hearing reviewed for clear error).

Assuming arguendo  that\r                                                                   \r\n\nLondon might still be  entitled to suppression without having\r\n\nmade any of  these arguments, our inquiry reduces  to whether\r\n\nthe  description  of  items  to be  seized  was  so  facially\r\n\ndefective that an  objectively reasonable officer would  have\r\n\nknown of the warrant's  unconstitutionality.  We hardly think\r\n\nso.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          Even if the description of items to be seized might\r\n\nhave been more particular, it was not patently overbroad when\r\n\nviewed  in  context.    London operated  a  complex  criminal\r\n\nenterprise  where  he   mingled  \"innocent\"  documents   with\r\n\napparently-innocent  documents  which, in  fact, memorialized\r\n\nillegal   transactions.     London   also  intermingled   his\r\n\nlegitimately-obtained and innocently-obtained  currency.   It\r\n\ntherefore would have been  difficult for the magistrate judge\r\n\nto be more limiting  in phrasing the warrant's language,  and\r\n\nfor the executing  officers to have  been more discerning  in\r\n\ndetermining what to seize.  In similar circumstances, we have\r\n\nstated: \r\n\n          We must . . . recognize that the inherent\r\n          difficulty  in  segregating  \"good\"  from\r\n          \"bad\"   records,   and  consequently   in\r\n          drawing up an adequately limited warrant,\r\n          makes it difficult  for even a reasonably\r\n          well-trained officer, who is not expected\r\n          to be a legal technician and  is entitled\r\n          to rely on  the greater sophistication of\r\n          the magistrate -- to know precisely where\r\n          to draw the line.\r\n\nUnited  States v.

Like Diaz, the question whether the description of\r                                \r\n\nitems to  be seized was unconstitutionally  overbroad was, at\r\n\nbest,  close,  and  the executing  officers  were objectively\r\n\nreasonable  in deferring  to the  magistrate judge's  trained\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\n          We therefore reject London's argument  that all the\r\n\nevidence  seized  during the  December  17,  1986, search  of\r\n\nHeller's should have been suppressed.\r\n\nC.

Seizing  upon the  highlighted\r\n\nlanguage,  London   contends  that  there   was  insufficient\r\n\nevidence that he conducted his check-cashing business with an\r\n\nintent to promote the  unspecified unlawful activity at issue\r\n\n-- i.e., illegal gambling.  We disagree.\r\n\n          There  was overwhelming evidence that London failed\r\n\nto file CTRs prior to the December 17, 1986, execution of the\r\n\nsearch  warrant at Heller's, and that London was aware of the\r\n\nreporting requirements  during the period in  which he failed\r\n\nto  file  CTRs.    There  also  was  evidence  that  London's\r\n\nunorthodox  operating  procedures  benefitted  his  bookmaker\r\n\ncustomers.   Finally,  there  was evidence  that London  made\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\nmoney with every check  he cashed.  Thus, there  was evidence\r\n\nthat London knowingly operated  his business in an unorthodox\r\n\nmanner  that  benefitted  both  his  bookmaker  customers and\r\n\n(derivatively) himself.  In our view, this evidence of mutual\r\n\ninterest is more than sufficient to sustain an inference that\r\n\nLondon operated his check-cashing business with the intent to\r\n\npromote the  illegal gambling businesses operated  by certain\r\n\nof his customers.\r\n\n          We  therefore reject  London's argument  that there\r\n\nwas  insufficient evidence  to  support his  money laundering\r\n\nconvictions.\r\n\n          2.  The Enterprise\r                      2.  The Enterprise\r                                        \r\n\n          The  RICO statute  prohibits  one  \"employed by  or\r\n\nassociated  with\"  a  statutorily-defined  \"enterprise\"  from\r\n\nconducting  the  enterprise's affairs  \"through a  pattern of\r\n\nracketeering activity  or collection  of unlawful debt.\"   18\r\n\nU.S.C.   1962(c).  The  enterprise alleged in the  indictment\r\n\nwas  an  association  between  London's  Cafe,  Inc.,  d/b/a/\r\n\nHeller's   --  a  corporation  --  and  M   &amp;  L  --  a  sole\r\n\nproprietorship.     London   questions  whether   there   was\r\n\nsufficient  evidence to  sustain a  finding that  the alleged\r\n\nenterprise was cognizable under RICO, arguing that (1) a RICO\r\n\nenterprise cannot  be an  association of legal  entities; (2)\r\n\nthe enterprise did not have a \"common or shared purpose which\r\n\nanimates those associated with it\" and did not \"function as a\r\n\n                             -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\ncontinuing  unit\" with  an \"ascertainable  structure distinct\r\n\nfrom   that  inherent  in   the  conduct  of   a  pattern  of\r\n\nracketeering  activity,\" see  United  States v.

We do not  find these\r\n\narguments convincing.\r\n\n          London's first argument is legal.  The RICO statute\r\n\nstates  that the term  \"`enterprise' includes any individual,\r\n\npartnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity,\r\n\nand  any union  or group  of  individuals associated  in fact\r\n\nalthough  not a legal entity.\"   18 U.S.C.   1961(4).  London\r\n\ncontends that, under  a plain reading  of this provision,  an\r\n\nassociation-in-fact RICO  enterprise such as the  one alleged\r\n\nhere  must  be  an  association of  individuals,  and  cannot\r                                                           \r\n\ninclude legal entities.  \r\n\n          London's argument has been addressed to a number of\r\n\ncircuit  courts, and each has rejected it.

See supra at 40-41.  We have not and do\r                                           \r\n\nnot  do  so today,  because even  if  we assume  arguendo the\r                                                                     \r\n\ntest's applicability,  there was ample evidence  for the jury\r\n\nto have found that its requirements were met.\r\n\n          The  jury could have found  that there was a common\r\n\nor shared  purpose animating both the  enterprise and London:\r\n\ndoing  commerce with (and  thereby profiting from) bookmakers\r\n\nengaged  in illegal gambling.  The evidence that London as an\r\n\nindividual pursued such a scheme is overwhelming and does not\r\n\nneed  repeating.   Moreover,  M &amp;  L  and Heller's  were  the\r\n\nprincipal means by  which London effectuated  his plan.   The\r\n\njury reasonably found that London used  M &amp; L to launder (for\r\n\na profit) the proceeds of illegal gambling for  his bookmaker\r\n\ncustomers,  and could  have found  that he  used  the privacy\r\n\nafforded by Heller's to shield M &amp;  L from close scrutiny, to\r\n\narrange meetings between Ferrara and his bookmaker customers,\r\n\nand to collect \"rent\" for Ferrara.\r\n\n          The jury also could  have found that the enterprise\r\n\nfunctioned  as a  continuing  unit and  had an  ascertainable\r\n\nstructure  distinct from  that inherent in  the conduct  of a\r\n\npattern  of racketeering activity.  As to the latter of these\r\n\ntwo requirements, M &amp; L and Heller's were legitimate entities\r\n\nthat did a significant amount of business completely separate\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\nfrom the pattern  of racketeering activity  at issue in  this\r\n\ncase.  Heller's was a bar where drinks and food were sold. \r\n\nM  &amp;  L was  a check-cashing  business  -- located  inside of\r\n\nHeller's and operated by the same individual who ran Heller's\r\n\n--  that  cashed checks  for customers  willing  to pay  it a\r\n\ncommission.   As to  the former  requirement, the jury  could\r\n\nreasonably  have surmised that M &amp; L and Heller's operated as\r\n\na symbiotic unit (M &amp; L  providing a ready source of cash for\r\n\nHeller's customers;  Heller's customers taking advantage of \r\n\nM  &amp; L's  convenience), and  that they  existed for  a common\r\n\npurpose:  the economic gain of London.\r\n\n          We  therefore reject  London's  argument  that  the\r\n\nBledsoe standard has not been met in this case.\r                   \r\n\n          London's third argument derives from  the fact that\r\n\n\"[w]e have consistently interpreted [RICO's] requirement that\r\n\na  culpable person be  `employed by  or associated  with' the\r\n\nRICO  enterprise as  meaning that  the same entity  cannot do\r\n\ndouble  duty  as  both  the  RICO   defendant  and  the  RICO\r\n\nenterprise.\"  Miranda  v.

He contends\r\n\nthat he, the  defendant named in  the indictment, is  legally\r\n\nindistinguishable from M &amp; L and Heller's.  \r\n\n          His argument overlooks the fact that M &amp;  L, though\r\n\na  sole proprietorship, had at  least one employee other than\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\nhimself, and the fact that Heller's  was incorporated and had\r\n\nseveral employees other than himself.  No more is required to\r\n\nestablish the separateness required by RICO.  As Judge Posner\r\n\nexplained in responding to a similar argument:\r\n\n          If the one-man band incorporates, it gets\r\n          some legal protections from the corporate\r\n          form, such  as limited liability;  and it\r\n          is  just this  sort  of legal  shield for\r\n          illegal  activity  that  RICO   tries  to\r\n          pierce.   A one-man  band  that does  not\r\n          incorporate,  that  merely operates  as a\r\n          proprietorship,     gains     no    legal\r\n          protections from the form in which it has\r\n          chosen to  do business;  the man  and the\r\n          proprietorship really are the same entity\r\n          in  law and  fact.   But  if the  man has\r\n          employees  or associates,  the enterprise\r\n          is distinct from  him, and it then  makes\r\n          no difference, so far as we can see, what\r\n          legal form  the  enterprise takes.    The\r\n          only important thing is that it be either\r\n          formally (as when there is incorporation)\r\n          or practically (as when there  are people\r\n          besides  the  proprietor  working in  the\r\n          organization)    separable    from    the\r\n          individual.\r\n\nMcCullough v.

We  need not\r\n\nand do  not reach  this argument.   As we  have pointed  out,\r\n\nLondon's RICO convictions are sustainable  so long as we  can\r\n\ntell with certainty that the jury found that he committed two\r\n\nsufficient predicate acts.  See supra at 39 (quoting </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Angiulo,</span>\r                                                                        \r\n\n<span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at  <span class=\"page\">1198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">).   Here, the jury  sustainably found  that\r\n\nLondon committed numerous predicate acts of money laundering.\r\n\nThus,  even if there were no nexus between the enterprise and\r\n\nthe racketeering acts involving  extortion and the collection\r\n\nof illegal debt (an issue on which we express no opinion), we\r\n\nwould sustain London's RICO convictions.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n          For   the  reasons  stated,  the  judgment  of  the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                              affirmed\r                                      \r\n\n                             -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n</pre>",
