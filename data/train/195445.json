This admiralty action stems from a\n          CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\nlate evening boating accident  which resulted in serious injuries\n\nto plaintiffs-appellants.   Although plaintiffs  obtained default\n\njudgments against the  operator of  the boat in  which they  were\n\nriding at the time  of the accident, the district  court directed\n\nentry  of judgment  as a  matter of  law in  favor  of defendant-\n\nappellee  Pendragon Marine Ltd., the  owner of the  boat, and the\n\nplaintiffs appealed.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          The S/Y DOLPHIN, a 75-foot sailing sloop, was moored in\n\nNewport  Harbor for the 1990  charter season.   She was crewed by\n\nCaptain Gordon  Percy, defendant Nicholas Pannell,  the engineer,\n\nand Robert Sass,  deckhand.   On Friday, July  27, 1990,  Captain\n\nPercy disembarked  for a weekend  in Cape Cod,  leaving defendant\n\nPannell  in  charge.   Prior  to  disembarking, Percy  instructed\n\nPannell that he  was not to  bring guests aboard  the yacht,  the\n\nDOLPHIN's 12-foot inflatable tender  was to be left on  deck, and\n\nthe  public launch service (for which the DOLPHIN held a season's\n\npass) was to be used for conveyance between the yacht and  shore.\n\n          Appellants Christine Favorito and Lenka Viducic arrived\n\nin  Newport the same  day.  As  fate would have  it, come evening\n\n                                2\n\nFavorito and Viducic met defendant Pannell,  who invited them and\n\na  third woman  aboard the DOLPHIN  for a  party.   Shortly after\n\nreaching the  DOLPHIN via  the public launch  service, appellants\n\nasked  to  be returned  to  shore.   By  this time  it  was after\n\nmidnight and the  public launch service was  no longer operating.\n\nDisregarding Captain  Percy's  orders, Pannell  offered to  ferry\n\nappellants  to shore in the 12-foot inflatable tender.  En route,\n\nthe inflatable  collided  with two  other vessels  moored in  the\n\nharbor.  Investigators opined that Pannell had been operating the\n\ntender  at   an  excessive  speed.     Favorito  suffered  facial\n\nlacerations and a broken jaw.  Viducic received back injuries and\n\na  laceration   to  the   forehead.    Both   required  extensive\n\nreconstructive and cosmetic surgery.\n\n          Appellants   instituted  the  present   action  in  the\n\nDistrict of  Rhode Island against Pannell  and appellee Pendragon\n\nMarine Ltd.   In due course, the case came to  trial.1  On motion\n\nby  Pendragon, the district court withdrew the case from the jury\n\nat  the conclusion  of plaintiffs-appellants'  case and  directed\n\nentry of judgment as  a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n50(a)(1) on the ground  that no rational jury could  find against\n\nPendragon on any of the three causes of action. \n\n                    \n\n     1Although  duly served,  Pannell failed  to appear;  default\njudgments  were  obtained  by  Favorito  ($250,000)  and  Viducic\n($100,000).\n\n                                3\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          A  judgment entered as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.\n\nR.  Civ. P. 50(a)(1) is subject  to plenary review under the same\n\nstringent standard incumbent  upon the trial  court in the  first\n\ninstance:\n\n          [W]e  must  examine   the  evidence  and  the\n          inferences  reasonably extractable  therefrom\n          in   the   light  most   hospitable   to  the\n          nonmovant.  To affirm withdrawal of any claim\n          from the jury, we  must find that, so viewed,\n          the   evidence    would   permit   thoughtful\n          factfinders   to   reach  but   one  reasoned\n          conclusion.\n\nFashion House, Inc.  v. K-Mart  Corp., 892 F.2d  1076, 1088  (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1989).2  \n\nA.   Negligent Retention\n                        \n\n          The  first cause of action  we address is  a variant on\n\nthe traditional tort  of negligent  hiring:  \"an  employer has  a\n\n[continuing] duty  to retain in its service  only those employees\n                            \n\nwho are  fit and competent.\"  Welsh Manuf. v.  Pinkerton's, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     2Absent   a   federal   liability   scheme,   the  governing\nsubstantive law in an  admiralty action is drawn from  common law\ntort principles  which comport with  the tenets of  maritime law.\nLyon  v. RANGER  III, 858  F.2d 22,  27 (1st  Cir. 1988).   Rhode\n                    \nIsland provides the principal  source of tort law relating  to an\naccident within its coastal  waters.  See id. (Massachusetts  law\n                                             \napplies  to  accident 1/4  mile off  Cape  Cod).   Ultimately, of\ncourse,  federal common  law  supersedes a  particular state  law\nformulation  with  which it  conflicts.   Puerto  Rico v.  SS ZOE\n                                                                 \nCOLOCOTRONI, 628 F.2d 652, 672 (1st Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450\n                                                            \nU.S. 912 (1981).\n\n                                4\n\n474 A.2d 436,  441 (R.I.  1984) (emphasis  added) (citing,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nDiCosala v. Kay, 450 A.2d  508 (N.J. 1982)).  An employer  is not\n               \n\nresponsible  for employee  torts committed  outside the  scope of\n\nemployment unless the  employer (1)  had \"reason to  know of  the\n\nparticular unfitness, incompetence or dangerous attributes of the\n          \n\nemployee\"  and  (2) \"could  reasonably  have  foreseen that  such\n                                                                 \n\nqualities  created a risk of  harm to other  persons.\"  DiCosala,\n                                                                \n\n450 A.2d 516 (emphasis added); accord Johnson v. Usdin Louis Co.,\n                                                                \n\n591 A.2d 959, 961 (N.J. 1991).  \n\n          One week  after joining  the DOLPHIN's  crew, defendant\n\nPannell was  stopped  by the  Harbormaster  for exceeding  the  5\n\nm.p.h. speed limit in Newport Harbor, and received a warning.  On\n\nJune 27, Pannell  again was  stopped for exceeding  the 5  m.p.h.\n\nlimit, and  received a  ticket.  The  next day Captain  Percy was\n\nsummoned to the Harbormaster's office, where he was informed that\n\nit  was his  responsibility to  ensure that  his crew  adhered to\n\nharbor  rules, and that  further infractions could  result in the\n\nDOLPHIN's exclusion from Newport  Harbor.  Captain Percy in  turn\n\ndelivered a stern lecture to Pannell and Sass.  \n\n          There  were  no  further  incidents,  and   the  record\n\ncontains no  evidence of  recklessness or other  unreliability on\n\nthe part of Pannell, until the date of the accident approximately\n\none  month later.    Indeed, Percy  testified  that he  had  been\n\npleased with Pannell's overall  performance and described Pannell\n\n                                5\n\nas  a  good  engineer  and  a responsible  crewman.    Appellants\n\npresented no evidence to the contrary.\n\n          Appellants contend  that a  jury could  reasonably have\n\nfound that Captain  Percy was negligent  to retain Pannell  after\n\nlearning  of the  two speeding  incidents, and  they insist  that\n\ndismissal  from employment  was  Pendragon's only  recourse.   We\n\nconclude,  however, that  the  district court  judgment is  amply\n\nsupported  by  the  record  evidence  viewed  in the  light  most\n\nfavorable to appellants.\n\n          Appellants  do not  identify, let  alone consider,  the\n\nparticular employee  qualities most pertinent to  their negligent\n\nretention claim.   This would be  a very different case  were the\n\nappropriate inquiry (as appellants would have it) whether Captain\n\nPercy  had  reason to  believe that  Pannell  might speed  in the\n\nharbor.   However, the proper  threshold inquiry     the sine qua\n                                                                 \n\nnon to appellants'  negligent retention claim    is whether there\n                                       \n\nis  any evidence  that Captain  Percy had  \"reason to  know,\" see\n                                                                 \n\nDiCosala,  450 A.2d  516, that  Pannell might  misappropriate the\n        \n\nDOLPHIN's  tender  for personal  use in  direct violation  of the\n\nCaptain's order.3  \n\n                    \n\n     3Careful  scrutiny   exposes      as  pure   speculation    \nappellants'  allegations that Pannell violated other orders given\nby  Captain Percy.  For  example, appellants point  out that both\ntimes Pannell was stopped for speeding in the harbor it was after\n6:00 p.m.   Consequently, they  speculate, Pannell's  use of  the\nboat  on  both those  occasions must  have  been in  violation of\nCaptain Percy's orders  because Pannell was using the  boat after\nhours.  However, Captain  Percy testified, without contradiction,\n\n                                6\n\n          It  would not be reasonable to infer    based solely on\n\nthe  two speeding  incidents     that  Captain Percy  should have\n\nforeseen, see id., that  Pannell would disobey a direct  order by\n                 \n\ntransporting personal  guests in the DOLPHIN's  tender during the\n\nCaptain's  absence.   And  absent any  evidence  that it  was not\n\nreasonable  for  Captain Percy  to rely  on  the adequacy  of the\n                                       \n\nprecautions  taken  before   disembarking,  the  prior   speeding\n\nincidents  did not give rise to a reasonably foreseeable \"risk of\n\nharm to  other persons,\" id.,  and the negligent  retention claim\n                            \n\nfails as a matter of law.  \n\n          The district court correctly rejected the position that\n\nan  employee  must be  dismissed  in  such circumstances  without\n\nregard to the  adequacy of the  employer's precautions against  a\n\nrecurrence of  the relevant employee  conduct.  See  Usdin Louis,\n                                                                \n\n591 A.2d at 961-62.  \"Public policy dictates that there should be\n\nno liability absent a showing that the employer reasonably should\n\nhave foreseen an unreasonably enhanced hazard.\" Id.  We hold that\n                                                   \n\na  negligent  retention  claim  does not  lie  absent  sufficient\n                       \n\nevidence  to  enable  a rational  factfinder  to  infer that  the\n\nemployer reasonably  should  have foreseen  that its  precautions\n\n                    \n\nthat the  crew was allowed to use the tender or dinghy (1) during\nworking hours; (2) on ship's  business; or (3) at any  other time\nwith  his express permission.  There is no evidence whatever that\nPannell  violated Percy's  orders  on either  occasion, nor  that\nthose  incidents took  place \"outside  working hours,\"  let alone\ninvolved nonbusiness or unauthorized  purposes.  Thus, the record\nis  devoid of evidence that Pannell ever disobeyed an order prior\n          \nto the night of the accident.  \n\n                                7\n\nwere inadequate  to protect persons in  appellants' position from\n\nan unreasonable risk of  harm resulting from a recurrence  of the\n\nemployee behavior of which the employer had prior notice.\n\nB.   Negligent Entrustment\n                          \n\n          The  second cause  of  action  asserts  that  Pendragon\n\nnegligently  entrusted  the  tender  to Pannell.    Rhode  Island\n\nessentially hews to  the common  law rule, see  Sabourin v.  LBC,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.,  731 F. Supp. 1145  (D.

On   appeal,  however,\n\nappellants urge us to vacate  the district court judgment because\n\nthe  jury  might  have  disbelieved  Captain  Percy's  deposition\n\ntestimony.    In other  words,  appellants argue,  judgment  as a\n\nmatter  of law  was  improper because  the  jury might  not  have\n\nbelieved that Percy forbade Pannell to use the tender. \n\n          The  Supreme  Court  has   pointed  out  that  Rule  50\n\n(judgment  as a  matter of  law) and  Rule 56  (summary judgment)\n\n\"mirror\"  one another.

I\nwouldn't have left the boat [in the first place].\"\n\n                                9\n\n242,  250  (1986).    See  also  Fed.  R.  Civ.

They\n          rely on Poller v. Columbia  Broadcasting Co.,\n                                                      \n          368 U.S. 464, 82 S. Ct. 486,  7 L. Ed. 2d 458\n          (1962),  for this  proposition.   We  do  not\n          understand  Poller, however,  to hold  that a\n                            \n          plaintiff may defeat  a defendant's  properly\n          supported  motion for  summary judgment  in a\n          conspiracy  or  libel   case,  for   example,\n          without offering any  concrete evidence  from\n          which  a  reasonable  juror  could  return  a\n          verdict in his favor and by merely  asserting\n          that  the  jury  might,  and  legally  could,\n\n                                10\n\n          disbelieve  the  defendant's   denial  of   a\n          conspiracy or of  legal malice.   The  movant\n          has the  burden of  showing that there  is no\n          genuine  issue of fact,  but the plaintiff is\n                                                       \n          not  thereby relieved  of his  own burden  of\n                                                       \n          producing in turn evidence that would support\n                                                       \n          a jury  verdict.

In  sum,\n\nappellants'   negligent   entrustment  claim   founders   on  the\n\nuncontroverted testimony that Captain Percy  specifically ordered\n\nPannell not to use the tender  during his absence.  As appellants\n\nrelied  entirely on  the totally  unsupported speculation  that a\n\njury  might disbelieve Captain  Percy's uncontroverted testimony,\n\nthe district court properly granted judgment as a matter of law. \n\nC.

Appellants correctly\n\npoint out that we have said that relevant hypothetical  questions\n\nmay be put  to lay witnesses  subject to the  Rule 403  balancing\n\ntest.  See, e.g., United States v. Ranney, 719 F.2d 1183, 1187-89\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1983).   Appellants, however,  would construe our  case\n\nlaw as declaring \"open season\" for hypothetical questions without\n\nregard  to  their overriding  prejudice,  cumulativeness  and the\n\n                                13\n\nlike.6   A review of the  Percy deposition satisfies us  that the\n\ndistrict  court carefully  exercised its  Rule 403  discretion by\n\nsustaining  most,  though  not   all,  objections  interposed  by\n\nPendragon.\n\n          Lastly,  appellants  challenge  the  denial   of  their\n\nbelated  motion   to  amend   their  complaint  to   name  Parker\n\nMontgomery, beneficial  owner of the DOLPHIN,  and the Montgomery\n\nGroup, as party defendants.  Appellants represent  that they were\n\nunable  to comply with the  March 12, 1993  deadline for amending\n\nthe  complaint because they did not learn that Montgomery was the\n\nbeneficial owner  until after Captain Percy's  deposition in June\n\n1993.  On the contrary, appellants acknowledged in their district\n\ncourt  pleadings   that  they   first  became  aware   of  Parker\n\nMontgomery's  role   in  October  1992.

She was crewed by Captain Gordon Percy, defendant Nicholas Pannell, the engineer, and Robert Sass, deckhand.  On Friday, July 27, 1990, Captain Percy disembarked for a weekend in Cape Cod, leaving defendant Pannell in charge.  Prior to disembarking, Percy instructed Pannell that he was not to bring guests aboard the yacht, the DOLPHIN's 12-foot inflatable tender was to be left on deck, and the public launch service (for which the DOLPHIN held a season's pass) was to be used for conveyance between the yacht and shore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants Christine Favorito and Lenka Viducic arrived in Newport the same day.  As fate would have it, come evening Favorito and Viducic met defendant Pannell, who invited them and a third woman aboard the DOLPHIN for a party.  Shortly after reaching the DOLPHIN via the public launch service, appellants asked to be returned to shore.  By this time it was after midnight and the public launch service was no longer operating.  Disregarding Captain Percy's orders, Pannell offered to ferry appellants to shore in the 12-foot inflatable tender.  En route, the inflatable collided with two other vessels moored in the harbor.  Investigators opined that Pannell had been operating the tender at an excessive speed.  Favorito suffered facial lacerations and a broken jaw.  Viducic received back injuries and a laceration to the forehead.

An employer is not responsible for employee torts committed outside the scope of employment unless the employer (1) had \"reason to know of the particular unfitness, incompetence or dangerous attributes of the employee\" and (2) \"could reasonably have foreseen that such qualities created a risk of harm to other persons.\"  Di Cosala, 450 A.2d at 516 (emphasis added);  accord Johnson v.

On June 27, Pannell again was stopped for exceeding the 5 m.p.h. limit, and received a ticket.  The next day Captain Percy was summoned to the Harbormaster's office, where he was informed that it was his responsibility to ensure that his crew adhered to harbor rules, and that further infractions could result in the DOLPHIN's exclusion from Newport Harbor.  Captain Percy in turn delivered a stern lecture to Pannell and Sass.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were no further incidents, and the record contains no evidence of recklessness or other unreliability on the part of Pannell, until the date of the accident approximately one month later.  Indeed, Percy testified that he had been pleased with Pannell's overall performance and described Pannell as a good engineer and a responsible crewman.  Appellants presented no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that a jury could reasonably have found that Captain Percy was negligent to retain Pannell after learning of the two speeding incidents, and they insist that dismissal from employment was Pendragon's only recourse.

This would be a very different case were the appropriate inquiry (as appellants would have it) whether Captain Percy had reason to believe that Pannell might speed in the harbor.  However, the proper threshold inquiry--the sine qua non to appellants' negligent retention claim--is whether there is any evidence that Captain Percy had \"reason to know,\" see Di Cosala, 91 N.J. 159, 450 A.2d at 516, that Pannell might misappropriate the DOLPHIN's tender for personal use in direct violation of the Captain's order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would not be reasonable to infer--based solely on the two speeding incidents--that Captain Percy should have foreseen, see id., that Pannell would disobey a direct order by transporting personal guests in the DOLPHIN's tender during the Captain's absence.  And absent any evidence that it was not reasonable for Captain Percy to rely on the adequacy of the precautions taken before disembarking, the prior speeding incidents did not give rise to a reasonably foreseeable \"risk of harm to other persons,\" id., and the negligent retention claim fails as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly rejected the position that an employee must be dismissed in such circumstances without regard to the adequacy of the employer's precautions against a recurrence of the relevant employee conduct.  See Usdin Louis, 248 N.J.Super. 525, 591 A.2d at 961-62.  \"Public policy dictates that there should be no liability absent a showing that the employer reasonably should have foreseen an unreasonably enhanced hazard.\"  Id.  We hold that a negligent retention claim does not lie absent sufficient evidence to enable a rational factfinder to infer that the employer reasonably should have foreseen that its precautions were inadequate to protect persons in appellants' position from an unreasonable risk of harm resulting from a recurrence of the employee behavior of which the employer had prior notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Negligent Entrustment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second cause of action asserts that Pendragon negligently entrusted the tender to Pannell.  Rhode Island essentially hews to the common law rule, see Sabourin v. LBC, Inc., 731 F.Supp. 1145 (D.R.I.1990) (surveying Rhode Island law), that \"the owner ... may be held liable for entrusting [its] vehicle to an incompetent, reckless or unfit driver if the owner knew or should have known of the driver's incompetence, inexperience or recklessness.\"  Id. at 1148.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  A rational factfinder could find no entrustment on this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants focus almost exclusively on whether it was negligent for Captain Percy to entrust the tender to Pannell, when in fact there was no entrustment, negligent or otherwise.  There is no evidence that Captain Percy permitted Pannell to use the tender in his absence.  Rather, the uncontroverted deposition testimony of Captain Percy established that he prohibited guests, directed Pannell to utilize the public launch service, and forbade use of the DOLPHIN's tender or dinghy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were it not for the unusual procedural posture, our discussion of the negligent entrustment claim would be at an end.  It was appellants who introduced Captain Percy's deposition into evidence, notwithstanding the fact that it cut sharply against their negligent entrustment claim.  On appeal, however, appellants urge us to vacate the district court judgment because the jury might have disbelieved Captain Percy's deposition testimony.  In other words, appellants argue, judgment as a matter of law was improper because the jury might not have believed that Percy forbade Pannell to use the tender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has pointed out that Rule 50 (judgment as a matter of law) and Rule 56 (summary judgment) \"mirror\" one another.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).  See also Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 advisory committee's notes accompanying 1991 amendment (stating that incorporation of the Rule 56 \"judgment as a matter of law\" standard into Rule 50 was intended to \"link the[se] two related provisions\").  It is well established that \"a mere challenge to the credibility of a movant's witnesses without any supporting evidence\" does not raise a trialworthy issue of fact.  Moreau v. Local Union No. 247, 851 F.2d 516, 519 (1st Cir.1988) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. at 2514);  Blanchard v. Peerless Ins. Co., 958 F.2d 483, 490 (1st Cir.1992) (noting:  nonmovant must demonstrate \"genuine dispute\" as to credibility in order to resist summary judgment);  10A Charles A. Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure:  Civil Sec. 2726, at 119 (2nd ed. 1983) (\"[S]pecific facts must be produced in order to put credibility in issue ... [u]nsupported allegations ... will not suffice.\").  As the Supreme Court explained in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>Respondents argue, however, that ... the defendant should seldom if ever be granted summary judgment where ... the jury might disbelieve him or his witnesses....  They rely on Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting Co., 368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962), for this proposition.  We do not understand Poller, however, to hold that a plaintiff may defeat a defendant's properly supported motion for summary judgment in a conspiracy or libel case, for example, without offering any concrete evidence from which a reasonable juror could return a verdict in his favor and by merely asserting that the jury might, and legally could, disbelieve the defendant's denial of a conspiracy or of legal malice.  The movant has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of fact, but the plaintiff is not thereby relieved of his own burden of producing in turn evidence that would support a jury verdict.   Rule 56(e) itself provides that a party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon mere allegation or denials of his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. at 2514 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we think it clear under Rule 50, as in the summary judgment context, that a bare assertion that the opposing party's uncontroverted evidence might be disbelieved is insufficient to resist judgment as a matter of law on an issue as to which the party resisting judgment bears the burden of proof.  See, e.g., Niemann v. Rogers, 802 F.Supp. 1154, 1157 (D.Del.1992) (noting that plaintiff bears burden of proving entrustment element in negligent entrustment claim).  Were it otherwise, Rules 50 and 56 could be rendered virtually useless, merely on the strength of a nonmovant's supposition that the movant's uncontroverted evidence might be disbelieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The authorities are in substantial accord that \"where the alleged entrustor has prohibited the entrustee from operating the automobile or using the instrumentality in question, there is no responsibility because there has been no entrustment.\"   J.D. Lee &amp; Barry A. Lindahl, Modern Tort Law Sec. 33.01 (Rev. ed. 1988) (citing Farney v. Herr, 358 S.W.2d 758, 761 (Tex.1962) (\"The doctrine of negligent entrustment may not be so extended as to impose liability upon the alleged 'trustor' for the negligent operation of a vehicle which he had expressly forbidden the alleged 'trustee' to drive.\"));  Kimble v. Muller, 417 P.2d 178 (Wyo.1966) (upholding summary judgment in favor of defendant on negligent entrustment claim where defendant father had instructed his reckless-driving son not to use automobile except for travel to and from work and school, but left the vehicle at home with the son when the father worked the night shift).  In sum, appellants' negligent entrustment claim founders on the uncontroverted testimony that Captain Percy specifically ordered Pannell not to use the tender during his absence.  As appellants relied entirely on the totally unsupported speculation that a jury might disbelieve Captain Percy's uncontroverted testimony, the district court properly granted judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Respondeat Superior</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third cause of action asserts that Pendragon is vicariously liable for appellants' injuries under the doctrine of respondeat superior.  See Sabourin, 731 F.Supp. at 1149 (under Rhode Island law, a corporation is liable for \"torts committed by agents acting within the scope of their authority or in the course of their employment\");  accord Drake v. Star Market Co., 526 A.2d 517, 518 (R.I.1987).  As the district court correctly ruled, there is no conceivable evidentiary basis for respondeat superior liability on the part of Pendragon.  The uncontroverted trial evidence established beyond peradventure that Pannell was on a frolic and banter of his own, actuated by no employer mission whatever and in direct violation of Captain Percy's explicit instructions not to use the tender and not to bring guests aboard the DOLPHIN.  See Restatement (Second) of Agency Sec. 228(1)(c) (1958);  see also, e.g., Gill Plumbing Co. v. Macon, 187 Ga.App. 481, 370 S.E.2d 657 (1988) (upholding summary judgment disallowing respondeat superior claim where employee was driving company vehicle on a \"purely personal mission,\" without authorization).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Miscellaneous Orders</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants attempted at trial to introduce portions of Captain Percy's videotape deposition which probed various hypothetical circumstances in which he might have considered it appropriate to discharge a crew member.  Appellants correctly point out that we have said that relevant hypothetical questions may be put to lay witnesses subject to the Rule 403 balancing test.  See, e.g., United States v. Ranney, 719 F.2d 1183, 1187-89 (1st Cir.1983).  Appellants, however, would construe our case law as declaring \"open season\" for hypothetical questions without regard to their overriding prejudice, cumulativeness and the like.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  A review of the Percy deposition satisfies us that the district court carefully exercised its Rule 403 discretion by sustaining most, though not all, objections interposed by Pendragon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, appellants challenge the denial of their belated motion to amend their complaint to name Parker Montgomery, beneficial owner of the DOLPHIN, and the Montgomery Group, as party defendants.  Appellants represent that they were unable to comply with the March 12, 1993 deadline for amending the complaint because they did not learn that Montgomery was the beneficial owner until after Captain Percy's deposition in June 1993.  On the contrary, appellants acknowledged in their district court pleadings that they first became aware of Parker Montgomery's role in October 1992.  Notwithstanding the admonition that leave to amend is to be \"freely given,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15, the district court did not abuse its discretion in these circumstances, see Johnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 595 F.2d 890, 896 (1st Cir.1979), especially since there has been no showing of prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Chief Judge Stephen Breyer heard oral argument in this matter, but did not participate in the drafting or the issuance of the panel opinion.

However, Captain Percy testified, without contradiction, that the crew was allowed to use the tender or dinghy (1) during working hours;  (2) on ship's business;  or (3) at any other time with his express permission.  There is no evidence whatever that Pannell violated Percy's orders on either occasion, nor that those incidents took place \"outside working hours,\" let alone involved nonbusiness or unauthorized purposes.

She was crewed by Captain Gordon Percy, defendant Nicholas Pannell, the engineer, and Robert Sass, deckhand.  On Friday, July 27, 1990, Captain Percy disembarked for a weekend in Cape Cod, leaving defendant Pannell in charge.  Prior to disembarking, Percy instructed Pannell that he was not to bring guests aboard the yacht, the DOLPHIN's 12-foot inflatable tender was to be left on deck, and the public launch service (for which the DOLPHIN held a season's pass) was to be used for conveyance between the yacht and shore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants Christine Favorito and Lenka Viducic arrived in Newport the same day.  As fate would have it, come evening Favorito and Viducic met defendant Pannell, who invited them and a third woman aboard the DOLPHIN for a party.  Shortly after reaching the DOLPHIN via the public launch service, appellants asked to be returned to shore.  By this time it was after midnight and the public launch service was no longer operating.  Disregarding Captain Percy's orders, Pannell offered to ferry appellants to shore in the 12-foot inflatable tender.  En route, the inflatable collided with two other vessels moored in the harbor.  Investigators opined that Pannell had been operating the tender at an excessive speed.  Favorito suffered facial lacerations and a broken jaw.  Viducic received back injuries and a laceration to the forehead.

The next day Captain Percy was summoned to the Harbormaster's office, where he was informed that it was his responsibility to ensure that his crew adhered to harbor rules, and that further infractions could result in the DOLPHIN's exclusion from Newport Harbor.

We do not understand Poller, however, to hold that a plaintiff may defeat a defendant's properly supported motion for summary judgment in a conspiracy or libel case, for example, without offering any concrete evidence from which a reasonable juror could return a verdict in his favor and by merely asserting that the jury might, and legally could, disbelieve the defendant's denial of a conspiracy or of legal malice.  The movant has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of fact, but the plaintiff is not thereby relieved of his own burden of producing in turn evidence that would support a jury verdict.   Rule 56(e) itself provides that a party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon mere allegation or denials of his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">477 U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">256,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See, e.g., Niemann v. Rogers, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In sum, appellants' negligent entrustment claim founders on the uncontroverted testimony that Captain Percy specifically ordered Pannell not to use the tender during his absence.  As appellants relied entirely on the totally unsupported speculation that a jury might disbelieve Captain Percy's uncontroverted testimony, the district court properly granted judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

As the district court correctly ruled, there is no conceivable evidentiary basis for respondeat superior liability on the part of Pendragon.  The uncontroverted trial evidence established beyond peradventure that Pannell was on a frolic and banter of his own, actuated by no employer mission whatever and in direct violation of Captain Percy's explicit instructions not to use the tender and not to bring guests aboard the DOLPHIN.

However, Captain Percy testified, without contradiction, that the crew was allowed to use the tender or dinghy (1) during working hours;  (2) on ship's business;  or (3) at any other time with his express permission.  There is no evidence whatever that Pannell violated Percy's orders on either occasion, nor that those incidents took place \"outside working hours,\" let alone involved nonbusiness or unauthorized purposes.
