Archie Whalen, while serving a federal\r                      Per Curiam.\r                                \r\n\nthree-year term of supervised  release, was arrested on state\r\n\ncharges of assaulting and criminally threatening his wife and\r\n\nchildren.   That arrest led to a revocation of his supervised\r\n\nrelease  by the district court  and a sentence  of six months\r\n\nimprisonment and an  additional two-year  term of  supervised\r\n\nrelease.  Whalen appeals,  claiming that the district court's\r\n\nfindings were factually unsupported.  We affirm.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          In  August 1991,  Whalen was  convicted  in federal\r\n\ncourt of various  firearms offenses and  sentenced to a  two-\r\n\nyear  prison term,  to be  followed by  a three-year  term of\r\n\nsupervised  release.   The supervised  release term  began in\r\n\nApril 1993.1   One of the conditions  of the release was that\r\n\nWhalen not commit any new  crimes, whether state, federal, or\r\n\nlocal.\r\n\n          On October 26, 1994,  the defendant was arrested in\r\n\nNew York on state charges  resulting from a violent  domestic\r\n\ndispute  with his  wife  Christina Whalen  and her  children.\r\n\nConsequently,   a  petition  to  revoke  Whalen's  supervised\r\n\nrelease  was filed.   The  petition  alleged that  Whalen had\r\n\nviolated New York penal  law by (1) threatening his  wife and\r\n\nher  children; (2)  physically assaulting  his wife;  and (3)\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1On January 5, 1993, the custodial portion of the\r\nsentence was reduced to 21 months, thus allowing for the\r\nrelease date in April.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nattempting  to contact his wife in violation of a state court\r\n\norder, issued following  his arrest, directing him not  to do\r\n\nso.\r\n\n          After   an   evidentiary  hearing   at   which  the\r\n\ngovernment   presented,  inter  alia,   sworn  statements  by\r                                                \r\n\nChristina Whalen attesting to the assault, the district court\r\n\nfound  by a preponderance of  the evidence that Archie Whalen\r\n\nhad committed the acts alleged  and ordered that his  release\r\n\nbe revoked.\r\n\n                         II. Mootness\r                                                 \r\n\n          During   the  pendency   of  this   appeal,  Whalen\r\n\ncompleted his  prison term and  resumed a term  of supervised\r\n\nrelease.   Apparently, shortly after being  released from his\r\n\nsix-month prison term,  Whalen again assaulted his  wife.  On\r\n\nJuly  27, 1995,  the  district court  again revoked  Whalen's\r\n\nsupervised release and  imposed a sentence of 12 months, with\r\n\nno  further term of  supervised release.   The government now\r\n\nargues that this second revocation makes the controversy over\r\n\nthe first  revocation moot because the  first revocation will\r\n\nno  longer have any  legally significant effect  on Whalen in\r\n\nthe  future.  As the government points out, however, there is\r\n\nat  least  one  set  of  circumstances  in  which  the  first\r\n\nrevocation could affect Whalen  in a legally significant way.\r\n\nUnder  the  Guidelines,  two  criminal  history  points   are\r\n\nassessed if  the defendant  commits a federal  offense within\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ntwo years of his  release from imprisonment on a  sentence of\r\n\nat  least 60  days.     United States  Sentencing Commission,\r\n\nGuidelines  Manual,   4A1.1(e).   A  prison  term served  for\r                              \r\n\nrevocation of  supervised release \"may affect  the points for\r\n\n 4A1.1(e)  in respect  to the  recency of  last release  from\r\n\nconfinement.\"  U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(k)(2)(A).   Should  the second\r\n\nrevocation  of supervised  release be  vacated on  appeal and\r\n\nWhalen commit an offense within two years of his release date\r\n\non the first revocation, the first revocation will affect the\r\n\ncalculation of Whalen's release date for purposes of applying\r\n\nthe criminal history provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines.\r\n\nThus  there could  be a  benefit to  Whalen should  the first\r\n\nrevocation  be  vacated.    In  light  of  such  a  potential\r\n\ncollateral  consequence, see  Carafas v.  LaVallee, 391  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n234, 237 (1968),  the controversy is not moot.\r\n\n                III.  Evidentiary Sufficiency\r                                                         \r\n\n          A.  The Evidence\r                                      \r\n\n          The  domestic violence incident took place when the\r\n\nWhalens were  in their  car searching for  Christina Whalen's\r\n\nson Robert, who  had run  away following a  dispute with  the\r\n\ndefendant.    Embroiled  in  an argument  with  her  husband,\r\n\nChristina Whalen got  out of the car and refused  to get back\r\n\nin.  Archie Whalen dragged her back into the car, kicking her\r\n\nover and over in the leg, and repeatedly closing the car door\r\n\non her leg and hip area.   Christina Whalen was later treated\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nat a local hospital emergency room for injuries suffered from\r\n\nthe  assault.   Archie Whalen was  arrested.  The  next day a\r\n\nlocal court  ordered Archie  Whalen not  to have  any contact\r\n\nwith  Christina  Whalen.    In  violation  of  the  order, he\r\n\npromptly telephoned his wife.\r\n\n          The key  pieces of documentary  evidence introduced\r\n\nat the revocation hearing were:\r\n\n(1)       Christina Whalen's  sworn statement dated\r\n          October  27,  1994 (attached  to  the New\r\n          York Prosecutor's Information) concerning\r\n          the events of October 26, 1994;\r\n(2)       Christina Whalen's  sworn statement dated\r\n          October    28,   1994    concerning   the\r\n          defendant's attempt to call her from jail\r\n          on that day; and\r\n(3)       Handwritten notes of Brenda  Catterson (a\r\n          social  worker  for  the  Maine  Dept. of\r\n          Human   Services)   concerning  a   phone\r\n          conversation   she  had   with  Christina\r\n          Whalen on October 27, 1994.\r\n\nThe district judge heard testimony from six witnesses:\r\n\n(1)       William Beck,  Whalen's probation officer\r\n          from 1991-1994;\r\n(2)       James   Gardella,    Whalen's   probation\r\n          officer  since 1994 (when Whalen moved to\r\n          New York);\r\n(3)       Christina Whalen, the defendant's wife;\r\n(4)       Brenda  Catterson, a social worker in the\r\n          Maine Child  Protective Services Division\r\n          of   the   Maine   Department  of   Human\r\n          Services;\r\n(5)       Marie Kelly Harding,  a supervisor in the\r\n          Child Protective Services Division of the\r\n          Maine Department of Human Services; and\r\n(6)       Defendant Archie Whalen.\r\n\nBecause  Archie  Whalen claims  that  this  evidence was  not\r\n\nadequate, this evidence is summarized below.\r\n\n1.  The October 27 Sworn Statement.\r                                              \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          This  sworn statement by Christina Whalen describes\r\n\nthe assault of October 26:\r\n\n               On or  about October  26, 1994 at  around 6:15\r\n          PM,  my husband  Archie Whalen  during an  on-going\r\n          argument  threatened  me   and  my  children   with\r\n          physical harm or death  if I didn't get in  the car\r\n          with him and  go looking for my  son, Robert Kealy,\r\n          who  had  left the  house  earlier  after having  a\r\n          verbal dispute with him.\r\n\n               I  was  dragged  into the  vehicle  by  Archie\r\n          Whalen, and was repeatedly kicked in the leg by him\r\n          when I  attempted  to exit  the  vehicle.   At  one\r\n          point,  I  was able  to  escape from  the  car, and\r\n          Archie  tried to  pull  me back  into the  vehicle.\r\n          During that time, Archie  repeatedly closed the car\r\n          door on my leg and hip area, causing great pain and\r\n          bruising. \r\n\n2.  The October 28 Sworn Statement.\r                                              \r\n\n          Christina  Whalen declares  in this  statement that\r\n\nshe received a collect call from the defendant on October 27,\r\n\nafter he  had  been ordered  not to  contact her.   When  she\r\n\nrecognized that  the  call was  from  her husband,  she  \"was\r\n\nterrified  to hear  his  voice and  immediately  hung up  the\r\n\ntelephone.\"\r\n\n3.  Brenda Catterson's Handwritten Notes.\r                                                    \r\n\n          These  notes  reflect   a  telephone   conversation\r\n\nbetween Catterson  and Christina Whalen on  October 27, 1994.\r\n\nChristina Whalen  had  left a  message at  the Department  of\r\n\nHuman Services  that she was having an \"emergency\" and wanted\r\n\nsomeone  to  call back.    When  Catterson called,  Christina\r\n\nWhalen told her  that she had confronted defendant  about his\r\n\nrelationship with  her daughter  Melissa, and that  he became\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n\"verbally belligerent.\"  Her son Robert  entered the room and\r\n\nattempted to defend  his mother and warned defendant  that he\r\n\nhad  better not harm her.  The defendant responded by telling\r\n\nRobert that  \"he'd break every bone in  his body and kill all\r\n\nthree of them before he'd go back to prison.\"\r\n\n4.  William Beck's Testimony.\r                                        \r\n\n          Beck,   defendant's  original   probation  officer,\r\n\nreceived  a phone call  from Christina Whalen  on October 27,\r\n\n1994.  She told him that defendant had been arrested and that\r\n\nshe was upset and  worried about the defendant's relationship\r\n\nwith  her children.   On  October 28,  she called  Beck again\r\n\nsaying  that the defendant had tried to call her collect from\r\n\njail, but  that she had hung up  immediately upon recognizing\r\n\nhis voice.\r\n\n5.  James Gardella's Testimony.\r                                          \r\n\n          Gardella,  defendant's  probation  officer  in  New\r\n\nYork,  learned from  a local  assistant district  attorney on\r\n\nOctober 27, 1994, that the defendant had been arrested.  Upon\r\n\nreceiving  the  news,  Gardella  then  interviewed  Christina\r\n\nWhalen  and her two children.  Christina Whalen told Gardella\r\n\nthat the defendant had kicked her and offered to show him the\r\n\nbruises on  her leg.   She  also told  Gardella that  she was\r\n\nfrightened of defendant, and  was afraid of the repercussions\r\n\nof  having filed charges against him.   Gardella asked Robert\r\n\nwhether  Archie  Whalen  had  ever threatened  him.    Robert\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nreplied that  the defendant  had indeed threatened  to \"break\r\n\nevery  bone in his body.\"  In speaking with Melissa, Gardella\r\n\nlearned that the defendant  had offered to buy her  beer, and\r\n\nthat he  had told her that  he, not her mother,  was the only\r\n\nperson Melissa should trust.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\n6.  Brenda Catterson's Testimony.\r                                            \r\n\n          Catterson's   testimony   basically  repeated   the\r\n\ncontents of her handwritten notes  of the telephone call from\r\n\nChristina Whalen on October 27, 1994.\r\n\n7.  Marie Kelly Harding's Testimony.\r                                               \r\n\n          Harding  testified about  a  conversation in  March\r\n\n1994,  before the  incident,  in which  Christina Whalen  had\r\n\nexpressed that she was frightened of the  defendant, that she\r\n\nfeared  he would kill  her, and that she  was worried that he\r\n\nmight harm her children.\r\n\n8.  Christina Whalen's Testimony.\r                                            \r\n\n          Christina Whalen, in  testimony, recanted her prior\r\n\nwritten  statements.   She testified  that she  believed that\r\n\nArchie Whalen  had not intentionally  tried to injure  her on\r\n\nOctober 26, and that the bruises on her leg resulted  when he\r\n\naccidentally closed the car door on  her leg.  She said  that\r\n\nshe had been out  of control that evening, and had  even told\r\n\nthe  defendant  and  her daughter  that  she  wanted  to kill\r\n\nherself.  She testified  that she had made up the story about\r\n\nbeing  assaulted only after the police officer who arrived at\r\n\nthe scene threatened to  place her in jail and  take away her\r\n\nchildren if  she failed to tell  the truth about why  she and\r\n\nher  husband were arguing.  As for the defendant's attempt to\r\n\ntelephone  her on October 27  in violation of  a court order,\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nshe testified that she had given  the defendant permission to\r\n\ncall, because her son Robert wanted to talk to him.\r\n\n9.  Defendant's Testimony.\r                                     \r\n\n          Archie Whalen  denied  assaulting  his  wife.

Reliability of the Evidence\r                                                     \r\n\n          Archie  Whalen  contends  that   because  Christina\r\n\nbacked away at  the revocation hearing  from her prior  sworn\r\n\nstatements, those sworn statements and her oral statements to\r\n\nBeck, Gardella, and Catterson  all lacked sufficient  indicia\r\n\nof reliability to form a basis for revocation.  Archie Whalen\r\n\nargues   there  was   no   other   evidence  supporting   the\r\n\ngovernment's petition and  so the  district court's  decision\r\n\nshould be reversed.  Whalen is wrong.\r\n\n          The standard  of proof  facing the government  in a\r\n\nrevocation proceeding  is a  preponderance  of the  evidence.\r\n\nUnited States v. Portalla, 985 F.2d 621, 622 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                     \r\n\nOn appellate review, the evidence must be viewed in the light\r\n\nmost  favorable to the government.   Id.   A district court's\r                                                    \r\n\nrevocation  decision \"will  not  be reversed  absent a  clear\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nshowing  of an abuse of discretion.\"  United States v. Morin,\r                                                                        \r\n\n889 F.2d 328, 331 (1st Cir. 1989).2\r\n\n          As  Whalen  appropriately  concedes, the  Rules  of\r\n\nEvidence do not apply in a revocation hearing.  See Portalla,\r                                                                        \r\n\n985 F.2d  at 622.  The evidence relied upon by the court must\r\n\nbe  reliable, and the district court  has broad discretion to\r\n\ndecide  questions of  reliability,  as well  as questions  of\r\n\nwitness  credibility.  Id.  Here, it was more than reasonable\r                                      \r\n\nfor the district court to conclude the evidence was reliable.\r\n\nThe  written statements  of  Christina Whalen  describing the\r\n\nevents of October 26-27,  1994 were made under oath  and were\r\n\ncorroborated  by  the  testimony   of  Beck,  Gardella,   and\r\n\nCatterson.  Cf. United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33,\r                                                           \r\n\n37  (1st Cir.  1990)  (holding  corroborated statements  made\r\n\nunder oath  to  be  reliable),  cert. denied,  500  U.S.  927\r                                                        \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2As a threshold matter, it does not appear that the\r\ndefendant raised any objection based on unreliability of\r\nevidence at the hearing.  Instead, the defendant's objections\r\nseemed to rest on relevance grounds.  See, e.g., December 14,\r                                                           \r\n1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 15 (\"Your Honor, I\r\nrealize the rules of evidence don't apply here, but I would\r\nask the court to exercise its discretion to limit the\r\nevidence today to information tending to prove or disprove\r\nthe violations charged in the revocation report.\"); see also\r                                                                        \r\nDecember 14, 1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 28\r\n(arguing that Christina Whalen's sworn statements are \"not\r\nhelpful\" to show that the conduct occurred); December 14,\r\n1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 63 (asking court to\r\n\"limit the evidence to the violations alleged\"); December 14,\r\n1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 65 (same). \r\nAccordingly, the district court's conclusions may be subject\r\nonly to plain error review.  We need not resolve that\r\nquestion here because no error occurred.\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\n(1991).    Furthermore,  Christina  Whalen  verified  at  the\r\n\nrevocation hearing  that the written statements  were in fact\r\n\nher  own.   Indeed,  she repeated  at  the hearing  that  the\r\n\ndefendant had slammed a car door on her leg; she  only denied\r\n\nbelieving that he had intentionally  done so.  Similarly, she\r\n\nnever denied at the hearing that the defendant  had attempted\r\n\nto call her in violation of a court order on  October 27; she\r\n\nclaimed only that she had invited him to do so.\r\n\n          Catterson's notes were  a contemporaneous record of\r\n\nan  \"emergency\" telephone conversation with Christina Whalen,\r\n\nand   the  contents   were  fully  verified   by  Catterson's\r\n\ntestimony.  Additionally, the statement in the notes that the\r\n\ndefendant had  threatened to  \"break every bone\"  in Robert's\r\n\nbody was corroborated by the  testimony of Gardella.  Indeed,\r\n\nthe defendant himself admitted to making that statement.\r\n\n          Finally,  Christina  Whalen's  recantation  of  her\r\n\nprior written  statements at  the revocation hearing  did not\r\n\nrender those sworn statements unreliable.  The district court\r\n\nhad far-ranging latitude to credit or discredit her courtroom\r\n\ntestimony,  and  there  is   no  basis  for  disturbing  that\r\n\ncredibility determination  here.   See Portalla, 985  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n624.  The district court was  well aware that the evidence at\r\n\nthe hearing encompassed  \"a very strong mixture  of truth and\r\n\nfiction,\"  and  decided  that   the  defendant  had  in  fact\r\n\ncommitted the violations described.\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\n          This was  far from  unreasonable.  The  court could\r\n\nsensibly   have  determined,  for   example,  that  Christina\r\n\nWhalen's  in-court change  of  heart concerning  the  alleged\r\n\nassault  was attributable to concern for her own safety.  The\r\n\ntestimony of several other witnesses  (particularly Gardella)\r\n\nestablished   that  she   feared   the   defendant  and   was\r\n\nparticularly afraid of retaliation  for her filing of assault\r\n\ncharges against him.  This pattern of behavior among women in\r\n\nabusive relationships  has been recognized in  a growing body\r\n\nof  academic   literature.    See   generally  Eva  Jefferson\r                                                         \r\n\nPaterson, How The Legal System Responds to Battered Women, in\r                                                                         \r\n\nBattered  Women 79, 86 (Donna M. Moore ed., 1979) (many women\r                           \r\n\nchange their  minds about  pressing  charges out  of fear  of\r\n\nfurther  violence from  the  assailant); see  also Lenore  E.\r                                                              \r\n\nWalker,  The  Battered Woman  Syndrome (1984)  (analyzing the\r                                                  \r\n\npsychological   characteristics   of    women   in    abusive\r\n\nrelationships).  The district court clearly did not abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion  in concluding  that \"there  is no way  . . . that\r\n\nChristina Whalen could  make this  scenario up  out of  whole\r\n\ncloth, and particularly with  the background evidence that is\r\n\nhere to support it.\"\r\n\n          The record,  viewed in the light  most favorable to\r\n\nthe  government, amply demonstrates  that the  district court\r\n\ndid  not   abuse  its  discretion   in  revoking  defendant's\r\n\nsupervised release.  See  United States v. Gallo, 20  F.3d 7,\r                                                            \r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\n14  (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[I]t is enough if the proof, reasonably\r\n\nviewed, satisfies the court that a violation occurred.\").\r\n\n          Finally,  the defendant  argues  in rather  cursory\r\n\nfashion that the district court failed adequately to disclose\r\n\nin its ruling the precise  basis for his revocation decision.\r\n\nThis argument is without merit.  The district court explained\r\n\nits ruling from the  bench.  The court clearly  announced its\r\n\nconclusion  that  the  defendant  had committed  all  of  the\r\n\nviolations of  New York penal  law alleged in  the revocation\r\n\npetition, namely:  \"that the  defendant did in  fact threaten\r\n\nhis wife and  children, whether he meant it or  not, and that\r\n\nhe did in fact cause his  wife to be assaulted and he did  in\r\n\nfact  telephone  his  wife  in  violation  of  the  order  of\r\n\nprotection.\"     This   clear  statement,   preceded  by   an\r\n\nelaboration  of  the court's  interpretation of  the evidence\r\n\nthat  had been presented, gave  the defendant ample notice of\r\n\nthe reasons that his supervised release was being revoked.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n",

That arrest led to a revocation of his supervised release by the district court and a sentence of six months imprisonment and an additional two-year term of supervised release.  Whalen appeals, claiming that the district court's findings were factually unsupported.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1991, Whalen was convicted in federal court of various firearms offenses and sentenced to a two-year prison term, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.  The supervised release term began in April 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  One of the conditions of the release was that Whalen not commit any new crimes, whether state, federal, or local.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 26, 1994, the defendant was arrested in New York on state charges resulting from a violent domestic dispute with his wife Christina Whalen and her children.  Consequently, a petition to revoke Whalen's supervised release was filed.  The petition alleged that Whalen had violated New York penal law by (1) threatening his wife and her children;  (2) physically assaulting his wife;  and (3) attempting to contact his wife in violation of a state court order, issued following his arrest, directing him not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an evidentiary hearing at which the government presented, inter alia, sworn statements by Christina Whalen attesting to the assault, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Archie Whalen had committed the acts alleged and ordered that his release be revoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Mootness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pendency of this appeal, Whalen completed his prison term and resumed a term of supervised release.  Apparently, shortly after being released from his six-month prison term, Whalen again assaulted his wife.  On July 27, 1995, the district court again revoked Whalen's supervised release and imposed a sentence of 12 months, with no further term of supervised release.  The government now argues that this second revocation makes the controversy over the first revocation moot because the first revocation will no longer have any legally significant effect on Whalen in the future.  As the government points out, however, there is at least one set of circumstances in which the first revocation could affect Whalen in a legally significant way.  Under the Guidelines, two criminal history points are assessed if the defendant commits a federal offense within two years of his release from imprisonment on a sentence of at least 60 days.  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Sec. 4A1.1(e).  A prison term served for revocation of supervised release \"may affect the points for Sec. 4A1.1(e) in respect to the recency of last release from confinement.\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(k)(2)(A).  Should the second revocation of supervised release be vacated on appeal and Whalen commit an offense within two years of his release date on the first revocation, the first revocation will affect the calculation of Whalen's release date for purposes of applying the criminal history provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines.  Thus there could be a benefit to Whalen should the first revocation be vacated.  In light of such a potential collateral consequence, see Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 237 (1968), the controversy is not moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Evidentiary Sufficiency</p>\n    <p>A. The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The domestic violence incident took place when the Whalens were in their car searching for Christina Whalen's son Robert, who had run away following a dispute with the defendant.  Embroiled in an argument with her husband, Christina Whalen got out of the car and refused to get back in.  Archie Whalen dragged her back into the car, kicking her over and over in the leg, and repeatedly closing the car door on her leg and hip area.  Christina Whalen was later treated at a local hospital emergency room for injuries suffered from the assault.  Archie Whalen was arrested.  The next day a local court ordered Archie Whalen not to have any contact with Christina Whalen.  In violation of the order, he promptly telephoned his wife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key pieces of documentary evidence introduced at the revocation hearing were:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Christina Whalen's sworn statement dated October 27, 1994 (attached to the New York Prosecutor's Information) concerning the events of October 26, 1994;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Christina Whalen's sworn statement dated October 28, 1994 concerning the defendant's attempt to call her from jail on that day;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Handwritten notes of Brenda Catterson (a social worker for the Maine Dept. of Human Services) concerning a phone conversation she had with Christina Whalen on October 27, 1994.

Christina Whalen's Testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Christina Whalen, in testimony, recanted her prior written statements.  She testified that she believed that Archie Whalen had not intentionally tried to injure her on October 26, and that the bruises on her leg resulted when he accidentally closed the car door on her leg.  She said that she had been out of control that evening, and had even told the defendant and her daughter that she wanted to kill herself.  She testified that she had made up the story about being assaulted only after the police officer who arrived at the scene threatened to place her in jail and take away her children if she failed to tell the truth about why she and her husband were arguing.  As for the defendant's attempt to telephone her on October 27 in violation of a court order, she testified that she had given the defendant permission to call, because her son Robert wanted to talk to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>9. Defendant's Testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Archie Whalen denied assaulting his wife.  He admitted threatening to \"break every bone\" in Robert's body, but explained that \"[i]t was a figure of speech to let him know how serious I was about him not using drugs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Reliability of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Archie Whalen contends that because Christina backed away at the revocation hearing from her prior sworn statements, those sworn statements and her oral statements to Beck, Gardella, and Catterson all lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to form a basis for revocation.  Archie Whalen argues there was no other evidence supporting the government's petition and so the district court's decision should be reversed.  Whalen is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of proof facing the government in a revocation proceeding is a preponderance of the evidence.  United States v. Portalla, 985 F.2d 621, 622 (1st Cir.1993).  On appellate review, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government.  Id. A district court's revocation decision \"will not be reversed absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\"  United States v. Morin, 889 F.2d 328, 331 (1st Cir.1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Whalen appropriately concedes, the Rules of Evidence do not apply in a revocation hearing.  See Portalla, 985 F.2d at 622.  The evidence relied upon by the court must be reliable, and the district court has broad discretion to decide questions of reliability, as well as questions of witness credibility.  Id. Here, it was more than reasonable for the district court to conclude the evidence was reliable.  The written statements of Christina Whalen describing the events of October 26-27, 1994 were made under oath and were corroborated by the testimony of Beck, Gardella, and Catterson.  Cf. United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33, 37 (1st Cir.1990) (holding corroborated statements made under oath to be reliable), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 927 (1991).  Furthermore, Christina Whalen verified at the revocation hearing that the written statements were in fact her own.  Indeed, she repeated at the hearing that the defendant had slammed a car door on her leg;  she only denied believing that he had intentionally done so.  Similarly, she never denied at the hearing that the defendant had attempted to call her in violation of a court order on October 27;  she claimed only that she had invited him to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Catterson's notes were a contemporaneous record of an \"emergency\" telephone conversation with Christina Whalen, and the contents were fully verified by Catterson's testimony.  Additionally, the statement in the notes that the defendant had threatened to \"break every bone\" in Robert's body was corroborated by the testimony of Gardella.  Indeed, the defendant himself admitted to making that statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Christina Whalen's recantation of her prior written statements at the revocation hearing did not render those sworn statements unreliable.  The district court had far- ranging latitude to credit or discredit her courtroom testimony, and there is no basis for disturbing that credibility determination here.  See Portalla, 985 F.2d at 624.  The district court was well aware that the evidence at the hearing encompassed \"a very strong mixture of truth and fiction,\" and decided that the defendant had in fact committed the violations described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was far from unreasonable.  The court could sensibly have determined, for example, that Christina Whalen's in-court change of heart concerning the alleged assault was attributable to concern for her own safety.  The testimony of several other witnesses (particularly Gardella) established that she feared the defendant and was particularly afraid of retaliation for her filing of assault charges against him.  This pattern of behavior among women in abusive relationships has been recognized in a growing body of academic literature.  See generally Eva Jefferson Paterson, How The Legal System Responds to Battered Women, in Battered Women 79, 86 (Donna M. Moore ed., 1979) (many women change their minds about pressing charges out of fear of further violence from the assailant);  see also Lenore E. Walker, The Battered Woman Syndrome (1984) (analyzing the psychological characteristics of women in abusive relationships).  The district court clearly did not abuse its discretion in concluding that \"there is no way ... that Christina Whalen could make this scenario up out of whole cloth, and particularly with the background evidence that is here to support it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, amply demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant's supervised release.  See United States v. Gallo, 20 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[I]t is enough if the proof, reasonably viewed, satisfies the court that a violation occurred.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendant argues in rather cursory fashion that the district court failed adequately to disclose in its ruling the precise basis for his revocation decision.  This argument is without merit.  The district court explained its ruling from the bench.  The court clearly announced its conclusion that the defendant had committed all of the violations of New York penal law alleged in the revocation petition, namely:  \"that the defendant did in fact threaten his wife and children, whether he meant it or not, and that he did in fact cause his wife to be assaulted and he did in fact telephone his wife in violation of the order of protection.\"  This clear statement, preceded by an elaboration of the court's interpretation of the evidence that had been presented, gave the defendant ample notice of the reasons that his supervised release was being revoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On January 5, 1993, the custodial portion of the sentence was reduced to 21 months, thus allowing for the release date in April</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As a threshold matter, it does not appear that the defendant raised any objection based on unreliability of evidence at the hearing.  Instead, the defendant's objections seemed to rest on relevance grounds.  See, e.g., December 14, 1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 15 (\"Your Honor, I realize the rules of evidence don't apply here, but I would ask the court to exercise its discretion to limit the evidence today to information tending to prove or disprove the violations charged in the revocation report.\");  see also December 14, 1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 28 (arguing that Christina Whalen's sworn statements are \"not helpful\" to show that the conduct occurred);  December 14, 1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 63 (asking court to \"limit the evidence to the violations alleged\");  December 14, 1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 65 (same).  Accordingly, the district court's conclusions may be subject only to plain error review.  We need not resolve that question here because no error occurred</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

That arrest led to a revocation of his supervised release by the district court and a sentence of six months imprisonment and an additional two-year term of supervised release.  Whalen appeals, claiming that the district court's findings were factually unsupported.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1991, Whalen was convicted in federal court of various firearms offenses and sentenced to a two-year prison term, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.  The supervised release term began in April 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  One of the conditions of the release was that Whalen not commit any new crimes, whether state, federal, or local.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 26, 1994, the defendant was arrested in New York on state charges resulting from a violent domestic dispute with his wife Christina Whalen and her children.  Consequently, a petition to revoke Whalen's supervised release was filed.  The petition alleged that Whalen had violated New York penal law by (1) threatening his wife and her children;  (2) physically assaulting his wife;  and (3) attempting to contact his wife in violation of a state court order, issued following his arrest, directing him not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an evidentiary hearing at which the government presented, inter alia, sworn statements by Christina Whalen attesting to the assault, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Archie Whalen had committed the acts alleged and ordered that his release be revoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Mootness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pendency of this appeal, Whalen completed his prison term and resumed a term of supervised release.  Apparently, shortly after being released from his six-month prison term, Whalen again assaulted his wife.  On July 27, 1995, the district court again revoked Whalen's supervised release and imposed a sentence of 12 months, with no further term of supervised release.  The government now argues that this second revocation makes the controversy over the first revocation moot because the first revocation will no longer have any legally significant effect on Whalen in the future.  As the government points out, however, there is at least one set of circumstances in which the first revocation could affect Whalen in a legally significant way.  Under the Guidelines, two criminal history points are assessed if the defendant commits a federal offense within two years of his release from imprisonment on a sentence of at least 60 days.  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Sec. 4A1.1(e).  A prison term served for revocation of supervised release \"may affect the points for Sec. 4A1.1(e) in respect to the recency of last release from confinement.\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2(k)(2)(A).  Should the second revocation of supervised release be vacated on appeal and Whalen commit an offense within two years of his release date on the first revocation, the first revocation will affect the calculation of Whalen's release date for purposes of applying the criminal history provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines.  Thus there could be a benefit to Whalen should the first revocation be vacated.  In light of such a potential collateral consequence, see Carafas v. LaVallee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107689\"><a href=\"/opinion/107689/carafas-v-lavallee/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, 237 (1968), the controversy is not moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The domestic violence incident took place when the Whalens were in their car searching for Christina Whalen's son Robert, who had run away following a dispute with the defendant.  Embroiled in an argument with her husband, Christina Whalen got out of the car and refused to get back in.  Archie Whalen dragged her back into the car, kicking her over and over in the leg, and repeatedly closing the car door on her leg and hip area.  Christina Whalen was later treated at a local hospital emergency room for injuries suffered from the assault.  Archie Whalen was arrested.  The next day a local court ordered Archie Whalen not to have any contact with Christina Whalen.  In violation of the order, he promptly telephoned his wife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key pieces of documentary evidence introduced at the revocation hearing were:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Christina Whalen's sworn statement dated October 27, 1994 (attached to the New York Prosecutor's Information) concerning the events of October 26, 1994;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Christina Whalen's sworn statement dated October 28, 1994 concerning the defendant's attempt to call her from jail on that day;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Handwritten notes of Brenda Catterson (a social worker for the Maine Dept. of Human Services) concerning a phone conversation she had with Christina Whalen on October 27, 1994.

Christina Whalen had left a message at the Department of Human Services that she was having an \"emergency\" and wanted someone to call back.  When Catterson called, Christina Whalen told her that she had confronted defendant about his relationship with her daughter Melissa, and that he became \"verbally belligerent.\"  Her son Robert entered the room and attempted to defend his mother and warned defendant that he had better not harm her.  The defendant responded by telling Robert that \"he'd break every bone in his body and kill all three of them before he'd go back to prison.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>4.

She told him that defendant had been arrested and that she was upset and worried about the defendant's relationship with her children.  On October 28, she called Beck again saying that the defendant had tried to call her collect from jail, but that she had hung up immediately upon recognizing his voice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>5.

Upon receiving the news, Gardella then interviewed Christina Whalen and her two children.  Christina Whalen told Gardella that the defendant had kicked her and offered to show him the bruises on her leg.  She also told Gardella that she was frightened of defendant, and was afraid of the repercussions of having filed charges against him.  Gardella asked Robert whether Archie Whalen had ever threatened him.  Robert replied that the defendant had indeed threatened to \"break every bone in his body.\"  In speaking with Melissa, Gardella learned that the defendant had offered to buy her beer, and that he had told her that he, not her mother, was the only person Melissa should trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>6.

She testified that she believed that Archie Whalen had not intentionally tried to injure her on October 26, and that the bruises on her leg resulted when he accidentally closed the car door on her leg.  She said that she had been out of control that evening, and had even told the defendant and her daughter that she wanted to kill herself.  She testified that she had made up the story about being assaulted only after the police officer who arrived at the scene threatened to place her in jail and take away her children if she failed to tell the truth about why she and her husband were arguing.  As for the defendant's attempt to telephone her on October 27 in violation of a court order, she testified that she had given the defendant permission to call, because her son Robert wanted to talk to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>9.

Reliability of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Archie Whalen contends that because Christina backed away at the revocation hearing from her prior sworn statements, those sworn statements and her oral statements to Beck, Gardella, and Catterson all lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to form a basis for revocation.  Archie Whalen argues there was no other evidence supporting the government's petition and so the district court's decision should be reversed.  Whalen is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of proof facing the government in a revocation proceeding is a preponderance of the evidence.

Portalla, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600258\"><a href=\"/opinion/600258/united-states-v-vincent-m-portalla-aka-vincent-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, 622 (1st Cir.1993).  On appellate review, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600258\"><a href=\"/opinion/600258/united-states-v-vincent-m-portalla-aka-vincent-marino/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> A district </a></span>court's revocation decision \"will not be reversed absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\"  United States v. Morin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532024\"><a href=\"/opinion/532024/united-states-v-roger-morin-aka-paris-video/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span>, 331 (1st Cir.1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Whalen appropriately concedes, the Rules of Evidence do not apply in a revocation hearing.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600258\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Portalla,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/600258/united-states-v-vincent-m-portalla-aka-vincent-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>.  The evidence relied upon by the court must be reliable, and the district court has broad discretion to decide questions of reliability, as well as questions of witness credibility.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600258\"><a href=\"/opinion/600258/united-states-v-vincent-m-portalla-aka-vincent-marino/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Here, it </a></span>was more than reasonable for the district court to conclude the evidence was reliable.  The written statements of Christina Whalen describing the events of October 26-27, 1994 were made under oath and were corroborated by the testimony of Beck, Gardella, and Catterson.  Cf. United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553331\"><a href=\"/opinion/553331/united-states-v-john-jairo-zuleta-alvarez-aka-john-zuleta-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1990) (holding corroborated statements made under oath to be reliable), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span> </span>(1991).  Furthermore, Christina Whalen verified at the revocation hearing that the written statements were in fact her own.  Indeed, she repeated at the hearing that the defendant had slammed a car door on her leg;  she only denied believing that he had intentionally done so.  Similarly, she never denied at the hearing that the defendant had attempted to call her in violation of a court order on October 27;  she claimed only that she had invited him to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Catterson's notes were a contemporaneous record of an \"emergency\" telephone conversation with Christina Whalen, and the contents were fully verified by Catterson's testimony.  Additionally, the statement in the notes that the defendant had threatened to \"break every bone\" in Robert's body was corroborated by the testimony of Gardella.  Indeed, the defendant himself admitted to making that statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Christina Whalen's recantation of her prior written statements at the revocation hearing did not render those sworn statements unreliable.  The district court had far- ranging latitude to credit or discredit her courtroom testimony, and there is no basis for disturbing that credibility determination here.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600258\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Portalla,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/600258/united-states-v-vincent-m-portalla-aka-vincent-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>.  The district court was well aware that the evidence at the hearing encompassed \"a very strong mixture of truth and fiction,\" and decided that the defendant had in fact committed the violations described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was far from unreasonable.  The court could sensibly have determined, for example, that Christina Whalen's in-court change of heart concerning the alleged assault was attributable to concern for her own safety.  The testimony of several other witnesses (particularly Gardella) established that she feared the defendant and was particularly afraid of retaliation for her filing of assault charges against him.  This pattern of behavior among women in abusive relationships has been recognized in a growing body of academic literature.  See generally Eva Jefferson Paterson, How The Legal System Responds to Battered Women, in Battered Women 79, 86 (Donna M. Moore ed., 1979) (many women change their minds about pressing charges out of fear of further violence from the assailant);  see also Lenore E. Walker, The Battered Woman Syndrome (1984) (analyzing the psychological characteristics of women in abusive relationships).  The district court clearly did not abuse its discretion in concluding that \"there is no way ... that Christina Whalen could make this scenario up out of whole cloth, and particularly with the background evidence that is here to support it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, amply demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant's supervised release.  See United States v. Gallo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195289\"><a href=\"/opinion/195289/united-states-v-gallo/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[I]t is enough if the proof, reasonably viewed, satisfies the court that a violation occurred.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendant argues in rather cursory fashion that the district court failed adequately to disclose in its ruling the precise basis for his revocation decision.  This argument is without merit.  The district court explained its ruling from the bench.  The court clearly announced its conclusion that the defendant had committed all of the violations of New York penal law alleged in the revocation petition, namely:  \"that the defendant did in fact threaten his wife and children, whether he meant it or not, and that he did in fact cause his wife to be assaulted and he did in fact telephone his wife in violation of the order of protection.\"  This clear statement, preceded by an elaboration of the court's interpretation of the evidence that had been presented, gave the defendant ample notice of the reasons that his supervised release was being revoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On January 5, 1993, the custodial portion of the sentence was reduced to 21 months, thus allowing for the release date in April</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As a threshold matter, it does not appear that the defendant raised any objection based on unreliability of evidence at the hearing.  Instead, the defendant's objections seemed to rest on relevance grounds.  See, e.g., December 14, 1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 15 (\"Your Honor, I realize the rules of evidence don't apply here, but I would ask the court to exercise its discretion to limit the evidence today to information tending to prove or disprove the violations charged in the revocation report.\");  see also December 14, 1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 28 (arguing that Christina Whalen's sworn statements are \"not helpful\" to show that the conduct occurred);  December 14, 1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 63 (asking court to \"limit the evidence to the violations alleged\");  December 14, 1994 Revocation Hearing Transcript at 65 (same).  Accordingly, the district court's conclusions may be subject only to plain error review.  We need not resolve that question here because no error occurred</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
