Anthony  Webster, Robert Bouthot\r                                      \n\nand  Manuel Ravelo  were convicted  of various  drug offenses\n\nstemming from  their involvement with  a cocaine distribution\n\nring centered  in  Portland,  Maine;  Warren  Huntington  was\n\nconvicted of  three offenses  arising from an  unrelated bank\n\nfraud scheme.    The  four  were sentenced  to  prison  terms\n\nranging  from 30 to 188  months, and each  now challenges his\n\nsentence.\n\n                         I.  Webster\n\n      On  December  3, 1993,  Webster  pled  guilty to  eight\n\nseparate  offenses, including the  use of a  firearm during a\n\ndrug trafficking  crime.  The guideline  sentencing range for\n\nall  offenses but the firearm offense was calculated to be 63\n\nto  78  months.   By statute  the  firearm offense  carried a\n\nmandatory minimum sentence of  60 months to run consecutively\n\nto any other sentence imposed.  See 18 U.S.C.   924(c).    \r                                               \n\n     Before sentencing  the government moved  for a  downward\n\ndeparture  from the guideline sentencing range in recognition\n\nof  Webster's cooperation  and testimony  in  prosecuting the\n\nother  members  of the  drug  conspiracy.   The  government's\n\nmotion  for  departure  invoked U.S.S.G.    5K1.1  and  thus,\n\naccording to the government,  sought a downward departure for\n\nthe guideline offenses only.   See U.S.S.G.   5K1.1 (allowing\r                                              \n\ndeparture  from  guidelines  on  government's  motion).   The\n\ngovernment  did not  request  a downward  departure under  18\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nU.S.C.   3553(e) from the statutory mandatory minimum for the\n\nfirearm offense.  \n\n     At  sentencing, Webster  did  not request  the court  to\n\ndepart below  the 60-month sentence for  the firearm offense,\n\nbelieving  that  the court  lacked  the  authority to  do  so\n\nbecause the  government had not moved  under section 3553(e).\n\nInstead, Webster  pressed the court to  award a proportionate\n\nreduction of his total sentence--subject to a 60-month floor-\n\n-and not just  the portion  of his sentence  governed by  the\n\nguidelines.  Webster then  argued for an overall  sentence of\n\n72 to 78 months.\n\n     The  district  court  responded that  this  \"defeats the\n\nwhole purpose of the statutory mandatory minimum\" and that it\n\nhad  to  \"set  that  aside\" for  purposes  of  determining  a\n\ndownward departure  of the guideline sentence.   The district\n\ncourt  then sentenced  Webster to  a total  of 90  months: 60\n\nmonths  for the firearm offense  and 30 months  for the other\n\noffenses,  to  run  consecutively.    The  30-month  sentence\n\nrepresented more than a 50 percent reduction in the guideline\n\nminimum of 63 months for those offenses.  \n\n     On appeal, as in  the district court, Webster challenges\n\nonly  the district  court's  refusal to  consider his  entire\n\nsentence when  deciding how  far to  depart on  the guideline\r                                                                         \n\noffenses.    Consequently, we  need  not  decide whether  the\n\ngovernment's  motion  under   U.S.S.G.    5K1.1  would   have\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ntriggered the court's authority under 18  U.S.C.   3553(e) to\n\ndepart below the statutory minimum, an issue that has divided\n\nthe circuits.  Compare  United States v. Wills, 35  F.3d 1192\r                                                          \n\n(7th  Cir. 1994), with United States v. Sanchez, 32 F.3d 1330\r                                                           \n\n(8th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115  S. Ct. 1119 (1995).   See\r                                                                         \n\nalso  Wade v.  United States,  112 S.  Ct. 1840,  1843 (1992)\r                                        \n\n(noting circuit split).       The  government  has  moved  to\n\ndismiss  Webster's   appeal  on  the  ground   that  we  lack\n\njurisdiction  to  review the  extent  of  a district  court's\n\ndeparture  from  the  guideline  sentencing  range.    We  do\n\nnormally lack jurisdiction over such a challenge, because the\n\nextent of  any permitted  departure is  left to  the district\n\ncourt's discretion.  United States v. Pighetti, 898 F.2d 3, 4\r                                                          \n\n(1st  Cir.  1990).   But where  the  departure may  have been\n\naffected by  a  mistake  of  law, as  Webster  alleges  here,\n\nappellate jurisdiction exists.  See United States v. Mariano,\r                                                                        \n\n983 F.2d 1150, 1153 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     To decide this case  without adopting a position on  the\n\nissue that divides the circuits is  somewhat artificial.  For\n\nif the Seventh Circuit view were followed, the district court\n\nwould  have power to depart even as to the mandatory minimum.\n\nBut we do  not want to  take sides here  on the larger  issue\n\nwhich  has neither been briefed nor argued.  Thus, solely for\n\npurposes of  this case, we  assume arguendo (as  the district\r                                                       \n\ncourt did without  that qualification) that  the government's\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nfailure to ask for a departure from the statutory minimum did\n\nprevent  the district court  from departing to  a point below\n\nthat figure.\n\n     On that  assumption, we agree that  the district court's\n\nposition  has  considerable  force:     any  reduction  of  a\n\nguideline  sentence  to offset  even  in  part a  consecutive\n\nstatutory minimum  tends to undercut Congress'  insistence on\n\nthe  statutory minimum.  At the same time, Congress has given\n\nthe sentencing court almost unreviewable discretion to decide\n\nthe  amount of the departure  after a 5K1.1  motion.  To tell\n\nthe  district court that it  must ignore any  factor that may\r                                                        \n\nseem   logically  relevant   arguably   collides  with   this\n\nintention.\n\n     We conclude that in  departing from a guideline sentence\n\nthe district court is free to exercise its own judgment as to\n\nthe pertinence,  if any,  of a related  mandatory consecutive\n\nsentence.   Should the  district court think  that the latter\n\nhas some role along  with other factors in fixing  the extent\n\nof a guideline departure in a particular case, that is within\n\nits  authority; and should that court decline to consider the\n\nmandatory minimum in  fixing the other sentence,  that too is\n\nwithin  its authority.   For  this court  to decide  upon the\n\ningredients  of  a departure  one by  one  would go  very far\n\ntoward defeating discretion.\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     We are confident that this difference in perspective had\n\nno impact  on the sentence in  this case.   Assuming that the\n\nstatutory minimum sentence fixed  a floor, the district court\n\nwas  free not to consider the statutory minimum in fixing the\n\nguideline sentence.  We have no reason whatever to think that\n\nthe  district court  would have  altered its  position, which\n\nrests on a rational policy judgment, if it had been told that\n\nthis choice was a matter of its discretion and not of law.\n\n     Still  less  do we  have any  reason  to think  that the\n\ndistrict  court's  sentence would  have been  less if  it had\n\nconsidered  the  mandatory minimum  sentence.   The  district\n\ncourt said that the  large departure it granted was  based on\n\nthe scope of Webster's  cooperation and the resulting benefit\n\nto the government.  It went on to say that this reduction was\n\n\"as  lenient as  permissible\"  given the  seriousness of  the\n\ndefendant's criminal conduct.   Indeed, if the district court\n\nhad wanted to depart further it had ample room to do so.\n\n     This  is not  a  case--as some  are--where the  district\n\ncourt  expressed  a desire  to  impose a  lower  sentence but\n\nthought  itself blocked by a supposed legal barrier.  Compare\r                                                                         \n\nUnited States v. Rivera,  994 F.2d 942, 953 (1st  Cir. 1993).\r                                   \n\nHere, the consecutive sentence  was mentioned by the district\n\ncourt only after  counsel for Webster sought  to introduce it\n\nas a mitigating factor.   The district court thought  that it\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nshould  not  be  so considered  and  was  free  to make  this\n\njudgment.  Accordingly we uphold the sentence.\n\n                         II.  Bouthot\n\n     On February 18, 1994,  Bouthot pled guilty to conspiracy\n\nto possess  cocaine with intent  to distribute, 21  U.S.C.   \n\n841, 846.  On July 1, 1994,  after a one-day hearing, Bouthot\n\nwas  sentenced to  151  months' imprisonment.   The  district\n\ncourt found  that Bouthot was responsible  for 3.83 kilograms\n\nof  cocaine, resulting in  a base offense  level of  30.  The\n\ncourt also added two levels for Bouthot's supervisory role in\n\nthe drug ring, and declined to make a downward adjustment for\n\nacceptance  of  responsibility.   U.S.S.G.      3B1.1, 3E1.1.\n\nWith  a  total offense  level of  32  and a  criminal history\n\ncategory of  III, the guideline  sentencing range was  151 to\n\n188 months, and the court chose the minimum.\n\n     The  district  court  based  the drug  quantity  on  the\n\ntestimony   of  Webster  at   Bouthot's  sentencing  hearing.\n\nWebster  said that  he  provided Bouthot  with  one to  three\n\nounces of cocaine three times a month for 14 months, and made\n\nseven trips to  New York  with Bouthot to  buy cocaine,  each\n\ntrip  yielding six to twelve  ounces of cocaine  but with one\n\ntrip netting  a half  kilogram.  Using  middle-to-low figures\n\nfor  the  drug amounts,  and  adjusting  for possible  double\n\ncounting for drugs from the New York trips subsequently given\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nto Bouthot,  the district  court calculated that  Bouthot was\n\nresponsible for 3.83 kilograms.  \n\n     Bouthot   claims  that   Webster's   testimony  was   an\n\nunreliable basis for establishing drug quantity.  It is  true\n\nthat  under   U.S.S.G.      6A1.3(a)  information  used   for\n\nsentencing  must have  sufficient indicia  of reliability  to\n\nsupport its probable  accuracy.  See United States v. Tavano,\r                                                                        \n\n12 F.3d  301 (1st Cir. 1993).   Bouthot cites to  a number of\n\ninconsistencies with  Webster's previous accounts  and points\n\nout that Webster was an admitted perjurer, a drug user, and a\n\nturncoat  who received  a substantially reduced  sentence for\n\nimplicating others.  \n\n     Credibility assessments at  sentencing are the  province\n\nof  the district  court and  are respected  on appeal  unless\n\nclearly erroneous.  United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1,\r                                                             \n\n4  (1st  Cir. 1993).    True,  Webster was  a  witness to  be\n\napproached  with  caution;  indeed,  he  had  twice  perjured\n\nhimself in  earlier proceedings  before  the district  court.\n\nBut  these  lies  occurred   before  Webster  had  agreed  to\n\ncooperate with the  government.  The district court  was free\n\nto  conclude that, once the  game was up,  Webster had wisely\n\nchosen to cooperate fully  and truthfully with the government\n\nin the hope of receiving a lightened sentence.\n\n     Bouthot next argues that, even assuming the  reliability\n\nof  Webster's testimony,  the mean \"per  transaction\" figures\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nused  by the  district court  as multipliers  lacked adequate\n\nevidentiary support; the  court settled on two ounces  as the\n\nper transaction amount for Bouthot's regular supply and eight\n\nounces  as the per trip amount for  six of the seven New York\n\ntrips.   Webster  had  testified unequivocally  that he  gave\n\nBouthot one to three ounces three times a month and that they\n\npurchased  six to  twelve ounces  on their  typical  New York\n\ntrip.     Bouthot  did  not object  to  the  district court's\n\nmethod of  drug computation  at the  time  of sentencing  and\n\ntherefore has  waived this issue.

Where no drugs have been seized, the guidelines\n\ninstruct  the  district  court  to  approximate  the  amounts\n\ninvolved,   U.S.S.G.   2D1.1  comment.

This case  is\n\nquite unlike United  States v. Sepulveda, 15  F.3d 1161, 1197\r                                                    \n\n(1st  Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.

All in  all, we\n\nthink that the figures  chosen by the district court  in this\n\ncase represent  a defensible estimate of  drug quantity based\n\non  the available evidence, and this is all that is required.\n\nMorillo,   8  F.3d  at  871.

Ct. 409 (1994).\r                  \n\n     Bouthot  also  says that  the  district  court erred  in\n\nfailing to  award him a two-point reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.  Bouthot did plead guilty  to the drug charge\n\nbut a  plea of guilty  is not  a guarantee for  receiving the\n\nreduction.   United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 606 (1st\r                                                 \n\nCir.  1990).   The  district  court  found that  Bouthot  had\n\nunderstated his criminal involvement.  This in turn warranted\n\na finding that Bouthot had not fully accepted responsibility.\n\nSee U.S.S.G.   3E1.1 comment. (n.1).\r               \n\n     The  two-level  adjustment  for  Bouthot's  role  in the\n\noffense  is also  supported.   Webster and  a DEA  agent both\n\ntestified  that  Bouthot  had recruited  an  individual named\n\nConwell  to sell  small amounts  of  cocaine for  him, paying\n\nConwell a  fixed commission on  every sale and  providing him\n\nwith housing from which to operate.  This testimony, accepted\n\nby the district court, is more than enough to qualify Bouthot\n\nfor  a two-point  adjustment for  exercising a  leadership or\n\nsupervisory  role  in  the  offense.   See  U.S.S.G.    3B1.1\r                                                      \n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\ncomment.  (n.4).   United  States v.  Fuller, 897  F.2d 1217,\r                                                        \n\n1219-22 (1st Cir. 1990).  \n\n                         III.  Ravelo\n\n     Ravelo was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to  possess\n\ncocaine with intent  to distribute.   On July  21, 1994,  the\n\ndistrict  court sentenced  him to  188 months'  imprisonment.\n\nThe court determined that Ravelo's base offense level was 34,\n\nbased  on a drug quantity  finding of 198.1  grams of cocaine\n\nbase, also known as crack.  No upward or downward adjustments\n\nwere made.   With no  prior criminal  record, Ravelo's  total\n\noffense  level yielded a guideline sentencing range of 151 to\n\n188 months,  and the court  sentenced him at  the top  of the\n\nrange.\n\n     As  with Bouthot,  Webster  was the  primary witness  at\n\nRavelo's sentencing hearing.   Webster testified that  Ravelo\n\nwas his New  York source for cocaine and that he purchased on\n\naverage 6 to  8 ounces  twice per  month from  1990 to  1993.\n\nConsistent  with   his  testimony  at   Bouthot's  sentencing\n\nhearing, Webster said that at times  the amounts were upwards\n\nof 11 to 13 ounces and that once he purchased a half kilogram\n\nfrom  Ravelo.  Webster also  testified that in  the summer of\n\n1993 he purchased from  Ravelo seven ounces of crack  made in\n\nRavelo's kitchen.\n\n     At  sentencing  the  district court  accepted  Webster's\n\ntestimony and found that Ravelo had sold Webster seven ounces\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n(198.1 grams)  of crack in  the summer  of 1993.   The  crack\n\nfinding  alone placed Ravelo at  a base offense  level of 34.\n\nSee  U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c)(5).    Ravelo, like  Bouthot, claims\r               \n\nthat  Webster's testimony  was unreliable.   But  Webster was\n\nvery  clear  about  the   crack  transaction--how  much   was\n\ninvolved, who was there, and how it was made.  This testimony\n\nwas  also   consistent  with   what  Webster  had   told  law\n\nenforcement agents  during his  debriefing.  For  the reasons\n\nalready set forth with respect to Bouthot, the district court\n\nwas free  to conclude  that Webster's testimony  was credible\n\nand sufficiently reliable.   \n\n     Ravelo  next  claims  that  he  should  have  been  held\n\naccountable  for  no more  than  1.26  kilograms of  cocaine,\n\nbecause this was the amount  for which Webster was sentenced,\n\nand both  participated in  the same transactions.   Webster's\n\nsentence was based  on 1.26 kilograms  of cocaine, an  amount\n\ncomputed by  a  probation officer  and stipulated  to by  the\n\nparties  at sentencing.   The  crack transaction  is excluded\n\nfrom  the stipulated  amount  but the  discrepancy is  easily\n\nexplained.\n\n     Evidence  of  the  crack  transaction  apparently  first\n\nsurfaced  during  Webster's  debriefing  by  law  enforcement\n\nagents.   But  before he  spoke, Webster  obtained a  written\n\npromise  from the government that none  of the information he\n\nprovided would be  used against him (with exceptions not here\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nrelevant).    Under the  guidelines,  this  promise immunized\n\nWebster from  having the crack transaction  count towards his\n\nsentence.  See U.S.S.G.   1B1.8(a).\r                          \n\n     We see  no problem  with holding Ravelo  responsible for\n\nthe greater  drug quantity actually proved  at his sentencing\n\nhearing.  First and  foremost, he did not cooperate  with the\n\ngovernment  and  thereby  receive   immunity  for  the  crack\n\ntransaction.     Although   the  guidelines   generally  seek\n\nuniformity  in  sentencing,  they  also  encourage  divergent\n\ntreatment  for  those  who  cooperate, in  order  to  promote\n\ngreater cooperation  with law  enforcement.   Given  Ravelo's\n\ndecision not  to cooperate, he  has no basis  for complaining\n\nabout leniency to someone who did cooperate.  \n\n     Ravelo's  final challenge  to  his  sentence relates  to\n\ncomments made by the district court at the time of sentencing\n\npertaining to Ravelo's  alien status.   Ravelo, a citizen  of\n\nthe  Dominican Republic,  claims  that the  court's  comments\n\nindicate that  he was sentenced  more harshly because  of his\n\nalienage   and  that  a  constitutional  violation  resulted.\n\nCompare United  States v.  Gomez, 797 F.2d  417, 418-21  (7th\r                                            \n\nCir. 1986) with United  States v. Leung, 40 F.3d  577, 585-87\r                                                   \n\n(2d Cir.  1994) and United States v.  Borrero-Isaza, 887 F.2d\r                                                               \n\n1349, 1353-56 (9th Cir. 1989). \n\n     The  district court  made clear  that it  was sentencing\n\nRavelo to the high end of  the guideline range because of his\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\ncontinued dishonesty and defiance.  Ravelo's alien status was\n\nraised by  Ravelo's counsel who requested  a lighter sentence\n\nbecause, as an alien, Ravelo  would be subject to deportation\n\nupon  his release from prison.  The sentencing judge said, in\n\nsubstance, that  Ravelo was  not entitled to  leniency simply\n\nbecause he  faced deportation,  for this would  undermine the\n\ndeterrent  value of Ravelo's sentence.  It is thus clear that\n\nthe  district  court  did  not punish  Ravelo  more  severely\n\nbecause of his alien status.\n\n                       IV.  Huntington\n\n     Huntington pled guilty  to two counts of bank  fraud, 18\n\nU.S.C.   1344,  and one  count of conspiracy  to commit  bank\n\nfraud,  18  U.S.C.    371,  1344.   The  scheme  involved the\n\nforging  and cashing  of  blank checks  stolen  from a  local\n\nhealth  center; the checks were stolen  by Webster, forged by\n\nHuntington and  cashed  by numerous  individuals  at  various\n\nbranches of the Casco Northern Bank on newly opened accounts.\n\nApart from  Webster's membership  in  both conspiracies,  the\n\nbank fraud scheme was unrelated to the drug ring.  Huntington\n\npled guilty  to  the  three  fraud  charges  against  him  on\n\nDecember 6, 1993.\n\n     Some  three   months  later,  on  the   morning  of  his\n\npresentence conference, Huntington moved to withdraw his plea\n\non the grounds of involuntariness; Huntington claimed that he\n\nhad been  threatened by  two codefendants--by Webster  and by\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nHuntington's own nephew  Stephen Huntington--to plead  guilty\n\nor face  physical harm.  On April 29, 1994, the court held an\n\nevidentiary hearing  on the plea-withdrawal  motion, at which\n\nHuntington  was   the  sole   witness.    At   the  hearing's\n\nconclusion,  the   court  denied  the  motion,  finding  that\n\nHuntington's story was a blatant, last-minute fabrication. \n\n     The  court  sentenced  Huntington   on  July  22,  1994.\n\nHuntington's conduct equated to an offense level of 11, which\n\nincluded a two-level increase for more than minimal planning.\n\nU.S.S.G.    2F1.1(b)(2)(A).   The  court imposed  a two-level\n\nupward adjustment for Huntington's organizational role in the\n\nscheme, U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c), and  a further two-level  upward\n\nadjustment  for obstruction  of justice,  based primarily  on\n\nHuntington's  perjurious  testimony  at  the  plea-withdrawal\n\nhearing.  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1.  With a criminal history category\n\nof III, the resulting guideline sentencing range was 24 to 30\n\nmonths,  and the court sentenced him to the maximum amount of\n\n30 months.\n\n     In making an upward  adjustment for Huntington's role in\n\nthe offense, the district court found as follows:\n\n     [T]his  defendant collaborated  with Webster  as to\n     devise,  carry out this scheme, forge and negotiate\n     stolen  checks,  and   that  he  typed  false   and\n     fictitious amounts and information about the payees\n     on several stolen checks.   The Court further finds\n     that   he  forged  the  authorized  signatures  and\n     assisted  Webster in  giving instructions  to other\n     participants in the scheme, directing their efforts\n     in the offense conduct.\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nBased on the first sentence of these findings, and on certain\n\nother  comments  made  by  the  sentencing judge,  Huntington\n\nargues  that  the  district  court  misunderstood  the  legal\n\nstandard  and   thought  it   enough   that  Huntington   was\n\nextensively  involved  in  the  conspiracy.    The  guideline\n\nrequires that  Huntington must  have controlled  or organized\n\nthe  activities of at least one other participant in the bank\n\nfraud scheme.  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c); Fuller, 897 F.2d at 1220;\r                                                      \n\nUnited States v. Castellone, 985 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                       \n\n     At  sentencing  the court  specifically  found that,  in\n\naddition  to playing  a central  role in  devising the  whole\n\nscheme,   Huntington   directed   and    instructed   various\n\nindividuals  on how  to negotiate  the forged  checks at  the\n\nbanks.  While the former conduct provides evidence suggesting\n\nan enhanced  role, see  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1 comment.  (n.4), the\r                                  \n\nlatter  conduct  conclusively  establishes   that  Huntington\n\ncontrolled or organized at least one other participant.\n\n     The record supports this assessment.  There was evidence\n\nthat Huntington  instructed an individual named  Jolin how to\n\npresent the forged checks for  acceptance and directed him to\n\ndifferent branches  of Casco Northern Bank  for that purpose.\n\nSteven  Huntington, the appellant's  nephew, testified at the\n\nsentencing hearing  that the appellant recruited  him to take\n\npart  in the  scheme  and that  the  appellant \"did  all  the\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\ntalking\"  when  distributing the  forged  checks  to him  and\n\nanother  check  casher named  Glantz.    At  the very  least,\n\nHuntington served as Webster's lieutenant, and the guidelines\n\ndo not limit  supervision to  one person.   U.S.S.G.    3B1.1\n\ncomment. (n.4).     Huntington  says  that  the  role-in-the-\n\noffense enhancement amounts  to impermissible double counting\n\nin view of  the district court's earlier enhancement for more\n\nthan minimal planning.  The two-level increase  for more than\n\nminimal  planning was based on  the fact that  the bank fraud\n\nscheme  involved repeated  episodes  of fraud;  the two-level\n\nincrease  for role in the offense, as we have just discussed,\n\nwas predicated on Huntington's  direction and supervision  of\n\nothers.   Because the two adjustments were  based on separate\n\nfactors,  there was  no double  counting.   United States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nBalogun, 989 F.2d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                   \n\n     Huntington   also  contests  the  upward  departure  for\n\nobstruction  of justice  under U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.   In making\n\nthis   adjustment,  the  court  relied  upon  three  separate\n\ninstances  of alleged  perjury,  but any  one is  sufficient.\n\nUnited  States v.

We confine  ourselves to the\r                  \n\ndistrict   court's  finding  that  Huntington  had  testified\n\nfalsely at  the plea-withdrawal hearing when  he claimed that\n\nhe was \"absolutely\" innocent of the bank fraud charges.\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\n     Under United States v.

Huntington\r                                                  \n\nargues that the court's  findings are legally insufficient to\n\nsupport   a  determination  of  perjury  under  the  Dunnigan\r                                                                         \n\nstandard.  We disagree.  On the first episode  of perjury the\n\ncourt found as follows:\n\n     The Court bases its  findings from the testimony of\n     this  defendant  .  .   .  at  the  proceedings  to\n     determine  whether   he  should  be   permitted  to\n     withdraw his  guilty plea.  The  Court is satisfied\n     that  his  disclaimer  of  participation  in  these\n     offenses in this offense  conduct at that time, his\n     protestation  of innocence  [was] false,  that that\r                                                        \n     testimony related to a  material matter and that it\r                                                        \n     was intended to influence the judgment of the Court\r                                          \n     in making the determination as to whether he should\n     be permitted to  withdraw his plea  of guilty.   In\n     that respect  the Court  is satisfied there  was an\n     obstruction   of   justice   by   this   defendant.\n     (emphasis added).\n\nThese findings  encompass all the predicates  for perjury and\n\nthus satisfy the requirements of Dunnigan.  \r                                                     \n\n     As for the factual bases for  those findings, the record\n\namply  supports  the judge's  ruling  under  the clear  error\n\nstandard.  Tracy,  36 F.3d  at 202.   At the  plea-withdrawal\r                            \n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\nhearing Huntington testified that he  was absolutely innocent\n\nof  the bank fraud charges brought against him, claiming that\n\nhe had been duped into signing the checks by Webster.  But at\n\nsentencing  four months later Huntington admitted his knowing\n\nparticipation in the  bank fraud scheme, although  not to the\n\nfull extent for which the district court ultimately found him\n\nresponsible.     As   such,  Huntington's   protestations  of\n\n\"absolute\" innocence  at the  withdrawal hearing were  not in\n\nany way ambiguous and amounted to perjury.

GIBSON,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anthony Webster, Robert Bouthot and Manuel Ravelo were convicted of various drug offenses stemming from their involvement with a cocaine distribution ring centered in Portland, Maine;  Warren Huntington was convicted of three offenses arising from an unrelated bank fraud scheme.  The four were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 30 to 188 months, and each now challenges his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Webster</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1993, Webster pled guilty to eight separate offenses, including the use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime.  The guideline sentencing range for all offenses but the firearm offense was calculated to be 63 to 78 months.  By statute the firearm offense carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before sentencing the government moved for a downward departure from the guideline sentencing range in recognition of Webster's cooperation and testimony in prosecuting the other members of the drug conspiracy.  The government's motion for departure invoked U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1 and thus, according to the government, sought a downward departure for the guideline offenses only.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1 (allowing departure from guidelines on government's motion).  The government did not request a downward departure under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(e) from the statutory mandatory minimum for the firearm offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Webster did not request the court to depart below the 60-month sentence for the firearm offense, believing that the court lacked the authority to do so because the government had not moved under section 3553(e).  Instead, Webster pressed the court to award a proportionate reduction of his total sentence--subject to a 60-month floor--and not just the portion of his sentence governed by the guidelines.  Webster then argued for an overall sentence of 72 to 78 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court responded that this \"defeats the whole purpose of the statutory mandatory minimum\" and that it had to \"set that aside\" for purposes of determining a downward departure of the guideline sentence. The district court then sentenced Webster to a total of 90 months:  60 months for the firearm offense and 30 months for the other offenses, to run consecutively.  The 30-month sentence represented more than a 50 percent reduction in the guideline minimum of 63 months for those offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, as in the district court, Webster challenges only the district court's refusal to consider his entire sentence when deciding how far to depart on the guideline offenses.  Consequently, we need not decide whether the government's motion under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1 would have triggered the court's authority under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(e) to depart below the statutory minimum, an issue that has divided the circuits.  Compare United States v. Wills, 35 F.3d 1192 (7th Cir.1994), with United States v. Sanchez, 32 F.3d 1330 (8th Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1119, 130 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1995).  See also Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 182, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (noting circuit split).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has moved to dismiss Webster's appeal on the ground that we lack jurisdiction to review the extent of a district court's departure from the guideline sentencing range.  We do normally lack jurisdiction over such a challenge, because the extent of any permitted departure is left to the district court's discretion.  United States v. Pighetti, 898 F.2d 3, 4 (1st Cir.1990).  But where the departure may have been affected by a mistake of law, as Webster alleges here, appellate jurisdiction exists.  See United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1153 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To decide this case without adopting a position on the issue that divides the circuits is somewhat artificial.  For if the Seventh Circuit view were followed, the district court would have power to depart even as to the mandatory minimum.  But we do not want to take sides here on the larger issue which has neither been briefed nor argued.  Thus, solely for purposes of this case, we assume arguendo (as the district court did without that qualification) that the government's failure to ask for a departure from the statutory minimum did prevent the district court from departing to a point below that figure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that assumption, we agree that the district court's position has considerable force:  any reduction of a guideline sentence to offset even in part a consecutive statutory minimum tends to undercut Congress' insistence on the statutory minimum.  At the same time, Congress has given the sentencing court almost unreviewable discretion to decide the amount of the departure after a 5K1.1 motion.  To tell the district court that it must ignore any factor that may seem logically relevant arguably collides with this intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that in departing from a guideline sentence the district court is free to exercise its own judgment as to the pertinence, if any, of a related mandatory consecutive sentence.  Should the district court think that the latter has some role along with other factors in fixing the extent of a guideline departure in a particular case, that is within its authority;  and should that court decline to consider the mandatory minimum in fixing the other sentence, that too is within its authority.  For this court to decide upon the ingredients of a departure one by one would go very far toward defeating discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are confident that this difference in perspective had no impact on the sentence in this case.  Assuming that the statutory minimum sentence fixed a floor, the district court was free not to consider the statutory minimum in fixing the guideline sentence.  We have no reason whatever to think that the district court would have altered its position, which rests on a rational policy judgment, if it had been told that this choice was a matter of its discretion and not of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still less do we have any reason to think that the district court's sentence would have been less if it had considered the mandatory minimum sentence.  The district court said that the large departure it granted was based on the scope of Webster's cooperation and the resulting benefit to the government.  It went on to say that this reduction was \"as lenient as permissible\" given the seriousness of the defendant's criminal conduct.  Indeed, if the district court had wanted to depart further it had ample room to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case--as some are--where the district court expressed a desire to impose a lower sentence but thought itself blocked by a supposed legal barrier.  Compare United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 953 (1st Cir.1993).  Here, the consecutive sentence was mentioned by the district court only after counsel for Webster sought to introduce it as a mitigating factor.  The district court thought that it should not be so considered and was free to make this judgment.  Accordingly we uphold the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Bouthot</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 18, 1994, Bouthot pled guilty to conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841, 846.  On July 1, 1994, after a one-day hearing, Bouthot was sentenced to 151 months' imprisonment.  The district court found that Bouthot was responsible for 3.83 kilograms of cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 30.  The court also added two levels for Bouthot's supervisory role in the drug ring, and declined to make a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  U.S.S.G. Secs. 3B1.1, 3E1.1.  With a total offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of III, the guideline sentencing range was 151 to 188 months, and the court chose the minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based the drug quantity on the testimony of Webster at Bouthot's sentencing hearing.  Webster said that he provided Bouthot with one to three ounces of cocaine three times a month for 14 months, and made seven trips to New York with Bouthot to buy cocaine, each trip yielding six to twelve ounces of cocaine but with one trip netting a half kilogram.  Using middle-to-low figures for the drug amounts, and adjusting for possible double counting for drugs from the New York trips subsequently given to Bouthot, the district court calculated that Bouthot was responsible for 3.83 kilograms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bouthot claims that Webster's testimony was an unreliable basis for establishing drug quantity.  It is true that under U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3(a) information used for sentencing must have sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.  See United States v. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301 (1st Cir.1993).  Bouthot cites to a number of inconsistencies with Webster's previous accounts and points out that Webster was an admitted perjurer, a drug user, and a turncoat who received a substantially reduced sentence for implicating others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Credibility assessments at sentencing are the province of the district court and are respected on appeal unless clearly erroneous.  United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1993).  True, Webster was a witness to be approached with caution;  indeed, he had twice perjured himself in earlier proceedings before the district court.  But these lies occurred before Webster had agreed to cooperate with the government.  The district court was free to conclude that, once the game was up, Webster had wisely chosen to cooperate fully and truthfully with the government in the hope of receiving a lightened sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bouthot next argues that, even assuming the reliability of Webster's testimony, the mean \"per transaction\" figures used by the district court as multipliers lacked adequate evidentiary support;  the court settled on two ounces as the per transaction amount for Bouthot's regular supply and eight ounces as the per trip amount for six of the seven New York trips.  Webster had testified unequivocally that he gave Bouthot one to three ounces three times a month and that they purchased six to twelve ounces on their typical New York trip.  Bouthot did not object to the district court's method of drug computation at the time of sentencing and therefore has waived this issue.  United States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir.1991).  In any event, we review the district court's drug quantity determinations for clear error, United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 871 (1st Cir.1993), and find no such error here.  Where no drugs have been seized, the guidelines instruct the district court to approximate the amounts involved, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 comment.  (n. 12), and we uphold such an approximation as long as it represents a reasoned estimate of quantity.  Morillo, 8 F.3d at 871.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the figures chosen by the district court were the mean figure for the small buys and on the conservative side for the New York trips, and they were drawn from ranges with relatively tight margins.  This case is quite unlike United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1197 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994), where we found it error to use the midpoint between four ounces and one kilogram as the average transaction.  All in all, we think that the figures chosen by the district court in this case represent a defensible estimate of drug quantity based on the available evidence, and this is all that is required.  Morillo, 8 F.3d at 871.   See also United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 490-91 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 409, 126 L.Ed.2d 356 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bouthot also says that the district court erred in failing to award him a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  Bouthot did plead guilty to the drug charge but a plea of guilty is not a guarantee for receiving the reduction.  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 606 (1st Cir.1990).  The district court found that Bouthot had understated his criminal involvement.  This in turn warranted a finding that Bouthot had not fully accepted responsibility.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 comment.  (n. 1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two-level adjustment for Bouthot's role in the offense is also supported.  Webster and a DEA agent both testified that Bouthot had recruited an individual named Conwell to sell small amounts of cocaine for him, paying Conwell a fixed commission on every sale and providing him with housing from which to operate.  This testimony, accepted by the district court, is more than enough to qualify Bouthot for a two-point adjustment for exercising a leadership or supervisory role in the offense.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1 comment.  (n. 4).  United States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217, 1219-22 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Ravelo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ravelo was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.  On July 21, 1994, the district court sentenced him to 188 months' imprisonment.  The court determined that Ravelo's base offense level was 34, based on a drug quantity finding of 198.1 grams of cocaine base, also known as crack.  No upward or downward adjustments were made.  With no prior criminal record, Ravelo's total offense level yielded a guideline sentencing range of 151 to 188 months, and the court sentenced him at the top of the range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with Bouthot, Webster was the primary witness at Ravelo's sentencing hearing.  Webster testified that Ravelo was his New York source for cocaine and that he purchased on average 6 to 8 ounces twice per month from 1990 to 1993.  Consistent with his testimony at Bouthot's sentencing hearing, Webster said that at times the amounts were upwards of 11 to 13 ounces and that once he purchased a half kilogram from Ravelo.  Webster also testified that in the summer of 1993 he purchased from Ravelo seven ounces of crack made in Ravelo's kitchen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing the district court accepted Webster's testimony and found that Ravelo had sold Webster seven ounces (198.1 grams) of crack in the summer of 1993.  The crack finding alone placed Ravelo at a base offense level of 34.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(5).  Ravelo, like Bouthot, claims that Webster's testimony was unreliable.  But Webster was very clear about the crack transaction--how much was involved, who was there, and how it was made.  This testimony was also consistent with what Webster had told law enforcement agents during his debriefing.  For the reasons already set forth with respect to Bouthot, the district court was free to conclude that Webster's testimony was credible and sufficiently reliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ravelo next claims that he should have been held accountable for no more than 1.26 kilograms of cocaine, because this was the amount for which Webster was sentenced, and both participated in the same transactions.  Webster's sentence was based on 1.26 kilograms of cocaine, an amount computed by a probation officer and stipulated to by the parties at sentencing.  The crack transaction is excluded from the stipulated amount but the discrepancy is easily explained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of the crack transaction apparently first surfaced during Webster's debriefing by law enforcement agents.  But before he spoke, Webster obtained a written promise from the government that none of the information he provided would be used against him (with exceptions not here relevant).  Under the guidelines, this promise immunized Webster from having the crack transaction count towards his sentence.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.8(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no problem with holding Ravelo responsible for the greater drug quantity actually proved at his sentencing hearing.  First and foremost, he did not cooperate with the government and thereby receive immunity for the crack transaction.  Although the guidelines generally seek uniformity in sentencing, they also encourage divergent treatment for those who cooperate, in order to promote greater cooperation with law enforcement.  Given Ravelo's decision not to cooperate, he has no basis for complaining about leniency to someone who did cooperate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ravelo's final challenge to his sentence relates to comments made by the district court at the time of sentencing pertaining to Ravelo's alien status.  Ravelo, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, claims that the court's comments indicate that he was sentenced more harshly because, of his alienage and that a constitutional violation resulted.  Compare United States v. Gomez, 797 F.2d 417, 418-21 (7th Cir.1986) with United States v. Leung, 40 F.3d 577, 585-87 (2d Cir.1994) and United States v. Borrero-Isaza, 887 F.2d 1349, 1353-56 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court made clear that it was sentencing Ravelo to the high end of the guideline range because of his continued dishonesty and defiance.  Ravelo's alien status was raised by Ravelo's counsel who requested a lighter sentence because as an alien, Ravelo would be subject to deportation upon his release from prison.  The sentencing judge said, in substance, that Ravelo was not entitled to leniency simply because he faced deportation, for this would undermine the deterrent value of Ravelo's sentence.  It is thus clear that the district court did not punish Ravelo more severely because of his alien status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Huntington</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huntington pled guilty to two counts of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344, and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 371, 1344.  The scheme involved the forging and cashing of blank checks stolen from a local health center;  the checks were stolen by Webster, forged by Huntington and cashed by numerous individuals at various branches of the Casco Northern Bank on newly opened accounts.  Apart from Webster's membership in both conspiracies, the bank fraud scheme was unrelated to the drug ring.  Huntington pled guilty to the three fraud charges against him on December 6, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some three months later, on the morning of his presentence conference, Huntington moved to withdraw his plea on the grounds of involuntariness;  Huntington claimed that he had been threatened by two codefendants--by Webster and by Huntington's own nephew Stephen Huntington--to plead guilty or face physical harm.  On April 29, 1994, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the plea-withdrawal motion, at which Huntington was the sole witness.  At the hearing's conclusion, the court denied the motion, finding that Huntington's story was a blatant, last-minute fabrication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court sentenced Huntington on July 22, 1994.  Huntington's conduct equated to an offense level of 11, which included a two-level increase for more than minimal planning.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2)(A).  The court imposed a two-level upward adjustment for Huntington's organizational role in the scheme, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(c), and a further two-level upward adjustment for obstruction of justice, based primarily on Huntington's perjurious testimony at the plea-withdrawal hearing.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  With a criminal history category of III, the resulting guideline sentencing range was 24 to 30 months, and the court sentenced him to the maximum amount of 30 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making an upward adjustment for Huntington's role in the offense, the district court found as follows:[T]his defendant collaborated with Webster as to devise, carry out this scheme, forge and negotiate stolen checks, and that he typed false and fictitious amounts and information about the payees on several stolen checks.  The Court further finds that he forged the authorized signatures and assisted Webster in giving instructions to other participants in the scheme, directing their efforts in the offense conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the first sentence of these findings, and on certain other comments made by the sentencing judge, Huntington argues that the district court misunderstood the legal standard and thought it enough that Huntington was extensively involved in the conspiracy.  The guideline requires that Huntington must have controlled or organized the activities of at least one other participant in the bank fraud scheme.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(c);  Fuller, 897 F.2d at 1220;  United States v. Castellone, 985 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing the court specifically found that, in addition to playing a central role in devising the whole scheme, Huntington directed and instructed various individuals on how to negotiate the forged checks at the banks.  While the former conduct provides evidence suggesting an enhanced role, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1 comment.  (n. 4), the latter conduct conclusively establishes that Huntington controlled or organized at least one other participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports this assessment.  There was evidence that Huntington instructed an individual named Jolin how to present the forged checks for acceptance and directed him to different branches of Casco Northern Bank for that purpose.  Steven Huntington, the appellant's nephew, testified at the sentencing hearing that the appellant recruited him to take part in the scheme and that the appellant \"did all the talking\" when distributing the forged checks to him and another check casher named Glantz.  At the very least, Huntington served as Webster's lieutenant, and the guidelines do not limit supervision to one person.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1 comment.  (n. 4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huntington says that the role-in-the-offense enhancement amounts to impermissible double counting in view of the district court's earlier enhancement for more than minimal planning.  The two-level increase for more than minimal planning was based on the fact that the bank fraud scheme involved repeated episodes of fraud;  the two-level increase for role in the offense, as we have just discussed, was predicated on Huntington's direction and supervision of others.  Because the two adjustments were based on separate factors, there was no double counting.  United States v. Balogun, 989 F.2d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huntington also contests the upward departure for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  In making this adjustment, the court relied upon three separate instances of alleged perjury, but any one is sufficient.  United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 199, 201 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 609, 130 L.Ed.2d 518 (1994).  We confine ourselves to the district court's finding that Huntington had testified falsely at the plea-withdrawal hearing when he claimed that he was \"absolutely\" innocent of the bank fraud charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under United States v. Dunnigan, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993), a witness commits perjury if he or she \"gives false testimony concerning a material matter with a willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake or faulty memory.\"   In Dunnigan, the Supreme Court instructed that a sentencing court must make independent findings necessary to establish the enhancement, preferably addressing each element of the alleged perjury in \"a separate and clear finding.\"  Id. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 1117.   Huntington argues that the court's findings are legally insufficient to support a determination of perjury under the Dunnigan standard.  We disagree.  On the first episode of perjury the court found as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>The Court bases its findings from the testimony of this defendant ... at the proceedings to determine whether he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea.  The Court is satisfied that his disclaimer of participation in these offenses in this offense conduct at that time, his protestation of innocence [was] false, that that testimony related to a material matter and that it was intended to influence the judgment of the Court in making the determination as to whether he should be permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty.  In that respect the Court is satisfied there was an obstruction of justice by this defendant.  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These findings encompass all the predicates for perjury and thus satisfy the requirements of Dunnigan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the factual bases for those findings, the record amply supports the judge's ruling under the clear error standard.  Tracy, 36 F.3d at 202.   At the plea-withdrawal hearing Huntington testified that he was absolutely innocent of the bank fraud charges brought against him, claiming that he had been duped into signing the checks by Webster.  But at sentencing four months later Huntington admitted his knowing participation in the bank fraud scheme, although not to the full extent for which the district court ultimately found him responsible.  As such, Huntington's protestations of \"absolute\" innocence at the withdrawal hearing were not in any way ambiguous and amounted to perjury.  See United States v. Austin, 948 F.2d 783, 789 (1st Cir.1991) (perjury committed at withdrawal hearing requires obstruction of justice adjustment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons the sentences of all four appellants are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The four were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 30 to 188 months, and each now challenges his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Webster</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1993, Webster pled guilty to eight separate offenses, including the use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime.  The guideline sentencing range for all offenses but the firearm offense was calculated to be 63 to 78 months.  By statute the firearm offense carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before sentencing the government moved for a downward departure from the guideline sentencing range in recognition of Webster's cooperation and testimony in prosecuting the other members of the drug conspiracy.  The government's motion for departure invoked U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1 and thus, according to the government, sought a downward departure for the guideline offenses only.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1 (allowing departure from guidelines on government's motion).  The government did not request a downward departure under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(e) from the statutory mandatory minimum for the firearm offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Webster did not request the court to depart below the 60-month sentence for the firearm offense, believing that the court lacked the authority to do so because the government had not moved under section 3553(e).  Instead, Webster pressed the court to award a proportionate reduction of his total sentence--subject to a 60-month floor--and not just the portion of his sentence governed by the guidelines.  Webster then argued for an overall sentence of 72 to 78 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court responded that this \"defeats the whole purpose of the statutory mandatory minimum\" and that it had to \"set that aside\" for purposes of determining a downward departure of the guideline sentence. The district court then sentenced Webster to a total of 90 months:  60 months for the firearm offense and 30 months for the other offenses, to run consecutively.  The 30-month sentence represented more than a 50 percent reduction in the guideline minimum of 63 months for those offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, as in the district court, Webster challenges only the district court's refusal to consider his entire sentence when deciding how far to depart on the guideline offenses.  Consequently, we need not decide whether the government's motion under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1 would have triggered the court's authority under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(e) to depart below the statutory minimum, an issue that has divided the circuits.  Compare United States v.

We do normally lack jurisdiction over such a challenge, because the extent of any permitted departure is left to the district court's discretion.  United States v. Pighetti, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537783\"><a href=\"/opinion/537783/united-states-v-dana-pighetti/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1990).  But where the departure may have been affected by a mistake of law, as Webster alleges here, appellate jurisdiction exists.  See United States v. Mariano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598971\"><a href=\"/opinion/598971/united-states-v-abel-a-mariano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span>, 1153 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To decide this case without adopting a position on the issue that divides the circuits is somewhat artificial.  For if the Seventh Circuit view were followed, the district court would have power to depart even as to the mandatory minimum.  But we do not want to take sides here on the larger issue which has neither been briefed nor argued.  Thus, solely for purposes of this case, we assume arguendo (as the district court did without that qualification) that the government's failure to ask for a departure from the statutory minimum did prevent the district court from departing to a point below that figure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that assumption, we agree that the district court's position has considerable force:  any reduction of a guideline sentence to offset even in part a consecutive statutory minimum tends to undercut Congress' insistence on the statutory minimum.  At the same time, Congress has given the sentencing court almost unreviewable discretion to decide the amount of the departure after a 5K1.1 motion.  To tell the district court that it must ignore any factor that may seem logically relevant arguably collides with this intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that in departing from a guideline sentence the district court is free to exercise its own judgment as to the pertinence, if any, of a related mandatory consecutive sentence.  Should the district court think that the latter has some role along with other factors in fixing the extent of a guideline departure in a particular case, that is within its authority;  and should that court decline to consider the mandatory minimum in fixing the other sentence, that too is within its authority.  For this court to decide upon the ingredients of a departure one by one would go very far toward defeating discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are confident that this difference in perspective had no impact on the sentence in this case.  Assuming that the statutory minimum sentence fixed a floor, the district court was free not to consider the statutory minimum in fixing the guideline sentence.  We have no reason whatever to think that the district court would have altered its position, which rests on a rational policy judgment, if it had been told that this choice was a matter of its discretion and not of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still less do we have any reason to think that the district court's sentence would have been less if it had considered the mandatory minimum sentence.  The district court said that the large departure it granted was based on the scope of Webster's cooperation and the resulting benefit to the government.  It went on to say that this reduction was \"as lenient as permissible\" given the seriousness of the defendant's criminal conduct.  Indeed, if the district court had wanted to depart further it had ample room to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case--as some are--where the district court expressed a desire to impose a lower sentence but thought itself blocked by a supposed legal barrier.  Compare United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 953 (1st Cir.1993).  Here, the consecutive sentence was mentioned by the district court only after counsel for Webster sought to introduce it as a mitigating factor.  The district court thought that it should not be so considered and was free to make this judgment.  Accordingly we uphold the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Bouthot</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 18, 1994, Bouthot pled guilty to conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841, 846.  On July 1, 1994, after a one-day hearing, Bouthot was sentenced to 151 months' imprisonment.  The district court found that Bouthot was responsible for 3.83 kilograms of cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 30.  The court also added two levels for Bouthot's supervisory role in the drug ring, and declined to make a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  U.S.S.G. Secs. 3B1.1, 3E1.1.  With a total offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of III, the guideline sentencing range was 151 to 188 months, and the court chose the minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based the drug quantity on the testimony of Webster at Bouthot's sentencing hearing.  Webster said that he provided Bouthot with one to three ounces of cocaine three times a month for 14 months, and made seven trips to New York with Bouthot to buy cocaine, each trip yielding six to twelve ounces of cocaine but with one trip netting a half kilogram.  Using middle-to-low figures for the drug amounts, and adjusting for possible double counting for drugs from the New York trips subsequently given to Bouthot, the district court calculated that Bouthot was responsible for 3.83 kilograms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bouthot claims that Webster's testimony was an unreliable basis for establishing drug quantity.  It is true that under U.S.S.G. Sec. 6A1.3(a) information used for sentencing must have sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.  See United States v. Tavano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195113\"><a href=\"/opinion/195113/united-states-v-tavano/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1993).  Bouthot cites to a number of inconsistencies with Webster's previous accounts and points out that Webster was an admitted perjurer, a drug user, and a turncoat who received a substantially reduced sentence for implicating others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Credibility assessments at sentencing are the province of the district court and are respected on appeal unless clearly erroneous.  United States v. Olivier-Diaz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195103\"><a href=\"/opinion/195103/united-states-v-olivier/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1993).  True, Webster was a witness to be approached with caution;  indeed, he had twice perjured himself in earlier proceedings before the district court.  But these lies occurred before Webster had agreed to cooperate with the government.  The district court was free to conclude that, once the game was up, Webster had wisely chosen to cooperate fully and truthfully with the government in the hope of receiving a lightened sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bouthot next argues that, even assuming the reliability of Webster's testimony, the mean \"per transaction\" figures used by the district court as multipliers lacked adequate evidentiary support;  the court settled on two ounces as the per transaction amount for Bouthot's regular supply and eight ounces as the per trip amount for six of the seven New York trips.  Webster had testified unequivocally that he gave Bouthot one to three ounces three times a month and that they purchased six to twelve ounces on their typical New York trip.  Bouthot did not object to the district court's method of drug computation at the time of sentencing and therefore has waived this issue.  United States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569296\"><a href=\"/opinion/569296/united-states-v-jaime-uricoechea-casallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 166 (1st Cir.1991).  In any event, we review the district court's drug quantity determinations for clear error, United States v.

Where no drugs have been seized, the guidelines instruct the district court to approximate the amounts involved, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 comment.  (n. 12), and we uphold such an approximation as long as it represents a reasoned estimate of quantity.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morillo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the figures chosen by the district court were the mean figure for the small buys and on the conservative side for the New York trips, and they were drawn from ranges with relatively tight margins.  This case is quite unlike United States v.

All in all, we think that the figures chosen by the district court in this case represent a defensible estimate of drug quantity based on the available evidence, and this is all that is required.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Morillo,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span>.

Bouthot did plead guilty to the drug charge but a plea of guilty is not a guarantee for receiving the reduction.  United States v. Bradley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir.1990).  The district court found that Bouthot had understated his criminal involvement.  This in turn warranted a finding that Bouthot had not fully accepted responsibility.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 comment.  (n. 1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two-level adjustment for Bouthot's role in the offense is also supported.  Webster and a DEA agent both testified that Bouthot had recruited an individual named Conwell to sell small amounts of cocaine for him, paying Conwell a fixed commission on every sale and providing him with housing from which to operate.  This testimony, accepted by the district court, is more than enough to qualify Bouthot for a two-point adjustment for exercising a leadership or supervisory role in the offense.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1 comment.  (n. 4).  United States v. Fuller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537727\"><a href=\"/opinion/537727/united-states-v-leonard-r-fuller/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1217</span></a></span>, 1219-22 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Ravelo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ravelo was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.  On July 21, 1994, the district court sentenced him to 188 months' imprisonment.  The court determined that Ravelo's base offense level was 34, based on a drug quantity finding of 198.1 grams of cocaine base, also known as crack.  No upward or downward adjustments were made.  With no prior criminal record, Ravelo's total offense level yielded a guideline sentencing range of 151 to 188 months, and the court sentenced him at the top of the range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with Bouthot, Webster was the primary witness at Ravelo's sentencing hearing.  Webster testified that Ravelo was his New York source for cocaine and that he purchased on average 6 to 8 ounces twice per month from 1990 to 1993.  Consistent with his testimony at Bouthot's sentencing hearing, Webster said that at times the amounts were upwards of 11 to 13 ounces and that once he purchased a half kilogram from Ravelo.  Webster also testified that in the summer of 1993 he purchased from Ravelo seven ounces of crack made in Ravelo's kitchen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing the district court accepted Webster's testimony and found that Ravelo had sold Webster seven ounces (198.1 grams) of crack in the summer of 1993.  The crack finding alone placed Ravelo at a base offense level of 34.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(5).  Ravelo, like Bouthot, claims that Webster's testimony was unreliable.  But Webster was very clear about the crack transaction--how much was involved, who was there, and how it was made.  This testimony was also consistent with what Webster had told law enforcement agents during his debriefing.  For the reasons already set forth with respect to Bouthot, the district court was free to conclude that Webster's testimony was credible and sufficiently reliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ravelo next claims that he should have been held accountable for no more than 1.26 kilograms of cocaine, because this was the amount for which Webster was sentenced, and both participated in the same transactions.  Webster's sentence was based on 1.26 kilograms of cocaine, an amount computed by a probation officer and stipulated to by the parties at sentencing.  The crack transaction is excluded from the stipulated amount but the discrepancy is easily explained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of the crack transaction apparently first surfaced during Webster's debriefing by law enforcement agents.  But before he spoke, Webster obtained a written promise from the government that none of the information he provided would be used against him (with exceptions not here relevant).  Under the guidelines, this promise immunized Webster from having the crack transaction count towards his sentence.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.8(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no problem with holding Ravelo responsible for the greater drug quantity actually proved at his sentencing hearing.  First and foremost, he did not cooperate with the government and thereby receive immunity for the crack transaction.  Although the guidelines generally seek uniformity in sentencing, they also encourage divergent treatment for those who cooperate, in order to promote greater cooperation with law enforcement.  Given Ravelo's decision not to cooperate, he has no basis for complaining about leniency to someone who did cooperate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ravelo's final challenge to his sentence relates to comments made by the district court at the time of sentencing pertaining to Ravelo's alien status.  Ravelo, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, claims that the court's comments indicate that he was sentenced more harshly because, of his alienage and that a constitutional violation resulted.  Compare United States v. Gomez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474256\"><a href=\"/opinion/474256/united-states-v-edgar-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 418-21 (7th Cir.1986) with United States v.

Ravelo's alien status was raised by Ravelo's counsel who requested a lighter sentence because as an alien, Ravelo would be subject to deportation upon his release from prison.  The sentencing judge said, in substance, that Ravelo was not entitled to leniency simply because he faced deportation, for this would undermine the deterrent value of Ravelo's sentence.  It is thus clear that the district court did not punish Ravelo more severely because of his alien status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Huntington</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huntington pled guilty to two counts of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344, and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 371, 1344.  The scheme involved the forging and cashing of blank checks stolen from a local health center;  the checks were stolen by Webster, forged by Huntington and cashed by numerous individuals at various branches of the Casco Northern Bank on newly opened accounts.  Apart from Webster's membership in both conspiracies, the bank fraud scheme was unrelated to the drug ring.  Huntington pled guilty to the three fraud charges against him on December 6, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some three months later, on the morning of his presentence conference, Huntington moved to withdraw his plea on the grounds of involuntariness;  Huntington claimed that he had been threatened by two codefendants--by Webster and by Huntington's own nephew Stephen Huntington--to plead guilty or face physical harm.  On April 29, 1994, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the plea-withdrawal motion, at which Huntington was the sole witness.  At the hearing's conclusion, the court denied the motion, finding that Huntington's story was a blatant, last-minute fabrication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court sentenced Huntington on July 22, 1994.  Huntington's conduct equated to an offense level of 11, which included a two-level increase for more than minimal planning.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2)(A).  The court imposed a two-level upward adjustment for Huntington's organizational role in the scheme, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(c), and a further two-level upward adjustment for obstruction of justice, based primarily on Huntington's perjurious testimony at the plea-withdrawal hearing.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  With a criminal history category of III, the resulting guideline sentencing range was 24 to 30 months, and the court sentenced him to the maximum amount of 30 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making an upward adjustment for Huntington's role in the offense, the district court found as follows:[T]his defendant collaborated with Webster as to devise, carry out this scheme, forge and negotiate stolen checks, and that he typed false and fictitious amounts and information about the payees on several stolen checks.  The Court further finds that he forged the authorized signatures and assisted Webster in giving instructions to other participants in the scheme, directing their efforts in the offense conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the first sentence of these findings, and on certain other comments made by the sentencing judge, Huntington argues that the district court misunderstood the legal standard and thought it enough that Huntington was extensively involved in the conspiracy.  The guideline requires that Huntington must have controlled or organized the activities of at least one other participant in the bank fraud scheme.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(c);  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537727\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fuller,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/537727/united-states-v-leonard-r-fuller/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span>;  United States v. Castellone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599288\"><a href=\"/opinion/599288/united-states-v-paul-j-castellone/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing the court specifically found that, in addition to playing a central role in devising the whole scheme, Huntington directed and instructed various individuals on how to negotiate the forged checks at the banks.  While the former conduct provides evidence suggesting an enhanced role, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1 comment.  (n. 4), the latter conduct conclusively establishes that Huntington controlled or organized at least one other participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports this assessment.  There was evidence that Huntington instructed an individual named Jolin how to present the forged checks for acceptance and directed him to different branches of Casco Northern Bank for that purpose.  Steven Huntington, the appellant's nephew, testified at the sentencing hearing that the appellant recruited him to take part in the scheme and that the appellant \"did all the talking\" when distributing the forged checks to him and another check casher named Glantz.  At the very least, Huntington served as Webster's lieutenant, and the guidelines do not limit supervision to one person.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1 comment.  (n. 4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huntington says that the role-in-the-offense enhancement amounts to impermissible double counting in view of the district court's earlier enhancement for more than minimal planning.  The two-level increase for more than minimal planning was based on the fact that the bank fraud scheme involved repeated episodes of fraud;  the two-level increase for role in the offense, as we have just discussed, was predicated on Huntington's direction and supervision of others.  Because the two adjustments were based on separate factors, there was no double counting.  United States v. Balogun, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602831\"><a href=\"/opinion/602831/united-states-v-henry-olawale-balogun-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23-24 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huntington also contests the upward departure for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  In making this adjustment, the court relied upon three separate instances of alleged perjury, but any one is sufficient.  United States v.

We confine ourselves to the district court's finding that Huntington had testified falsely at the plea-withdrawal hearing when he claimed that he was \"absolutely\" innocent of the bank fraud charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under United States v.

Huntington argues that the court's findings are legally insufficient to support a determination of perjury under the Dunnigan standard.  We disagree.

The Court is satisfied that his disclaimer of participation in these offenses in this offense conduct at that time, his protestation of innocence [was] false, that that testimony related to a material matter and that it was intended to influence the judgment of the Court in making the determination as to whether he should be permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty.  In that respect the Court is satisfied there was an obstruction of justice by this defendant.

At the plea-withdrawal hearing Huntington testified that he was absolutely innocent of the bank fraud charges brought against him, claiming that he had been duped into signing the checks by Webster.  But at sentencing four months later Huntington admitted his knowing participation in the bank fraud scheme, although not to the full extent for which the district court ultimately found him responsible.  As such, Huntington's protestations of \"absolute\" innocence at the withdrawal hearing were not in any way ambiguous and amounted to perjury.  See United States v.
