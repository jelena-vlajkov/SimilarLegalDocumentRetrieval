Defendant  Luis   Alzate  appeals   his\r                            \r\n\nconviction for possessing cocaine with intent  to distribute,\r\n\n21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1) and  (b)(1)(B), contending  that two\r\n\nerrors in  the jury  instructions relating to  his entrapment\r\n\ndefense  warrant reversal.  As Alzate failed to object at the\r\n\ntime the  instructions were given,  we review only  for plain\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n     1.   One element of  entrapment is  that the  government\r\n\nhave instigated the defendant's conduct.  E.g., United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994).  Alzate claims\r                       \r\n\nthat the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury\r\n\nthat   the  actions   of  the   FBI's  paid   informant  were\r\n\nattributable   to   the   government.      The   government's\r\n\nresponsibility for the informant was not in dispute at trial,\r\n\nand Alzate understandably sought no instruction.\r\n\n     Nevertheless,  on appeal Alzate  relies upon  an earlier\r\n\ndictum of this court that where the  government concedes that\r\n\nthe  actions   of  its  informer  are   attributable  to  the\r\n\ngovernment, the jury should be so  instructed.  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Annese, 631 F.2d 1041,  1048 (1st Cir. 1980).  In  Annese,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthe trial  judge had  confused matters by  instructing jurors\r\n\nthat they must  determine whether  the \"inducing\"  individual\r\n\nwas  an agent  for  the government,  even  though no  dispute\r\n\nexisted as to  that issue.   Annese certainly  does not  hold\r                                               \r\n\nthat it  is reversible  error to  forego the instruction  now\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nclaimed  necessary where,  as  here, no  such instruction  is\r\n\nsought and there is no indication of prejudice.\r\n\n     Ordinarily, a  claimed error  to which no  objection was\r\n\nmade at trial  will not  be considered without  a showing  of\r\n\nlikely effect on the outcome.  United States v. Olano, 113 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt. 1770, 1777-778  (1993).   Here, we have  every reason  to\r\n\nthink that the jury clearly understood that the informant was\r\n\nacting  as  a   government  agent.     Undisputed   testimony\r\n\nestablished that  the informant  was paid by  the government,\r\n\nreceived instruction from FBI agents, and regularly  reported\r\n\nto  the FBI.   Indeed, the prosecution's  own closing remarks\r\n\nconceded  that the  inducer \"was  a paid  FBI informant\"  who\r\n\narranged the drug  transaction \"on  behalf of the  FBI.\"   On\r\n\nthese  facts we  find no  prejudice, even  assuming that  the\r\n\ndictum in Annese should be extended beyond the peculiar facts\r                            \r\n\nof that case.\r\n\n     2.    The  other  element  of  the  standard  entrapment\r\n\ninstruction  requires  the   government  to  show   that  the\r\n\ndefendant, if induced to commit the crime, was predisposed to\r\n\ndo  it before  the government  approached  him.   Gifford, 17\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d.  468.  The instructions here so advised the jury in the\r\n\nconventional manner.  Among  other references, the judge told\r\n\nthe jury that the entrapment defense applies when a defendant\r\n\n\"who has no previous intent to commit a crime is persuaded to\r\n\ndo so by the Government through  its agents.\"  The court also\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nsaid that, for an entrapment claim  to prevail, the defendant\r\n\nmust  be \"not predisposed to engage in such conduct\" and that\r\n\nthe entrapment  defense would not apply  \"[i]f the Government\r\n\nproves the Defendant was ready and willing to break the law .\r\n\n. . .\"\r\n\n     The subtlety  now relied upon  by Alzate  is that  under\r\n\nJacobson  v. United States, 503  U.S. 540, 549  &amp; n.2 (1992),\r                                      \r\n\nthe government cannot prove predisposition if the defendant's\r\n\nwillingness to  commit the  crime was itself  manufactured by\r\n\nthe government in  the course of  dealing with the  defendant\r\n\nbefore he committed  the crime  charged.  We  think that  the\r\n\nfirst  of  the  instructions  quoted  above--referring  to  a\r\n\ndefendant  with \"no previous intent to commit a crime\" who is\r\n\n\"persuaded . .  . by the Government\"--does  convey the notion\r\n\nthat the question posed was whether Alzate did  have criminal\r\n\nintent before  the government  persuasion occurred.   While a\r                         \r\n\nmore  precisely tailored  instruction  might well  have  been\r\n\nsuitable  if specially sought, such refinements tailoring the\r\n\nlanguage to the situation  require that the judge  be advised\r\n\nof the request.  We  do not think that there was  plain error\r\n\nin the charge.\r\n\n     We  also have  little reason to  think that  the precise\r\n\nphrasing of the instruction affected the outcome.  Alzate did\r\n\ntestify that he was repeatedly badgered by the informant, but\r\n\nhis  claims were not entirely borne out by what was recorded.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nMoreover,  Alzate,  who had  a beeper  with  him when  he was\r\n\narrested, also was found  to have in his house  an electronic\r\n\nscale, a kit for testing cocaine including a chemical used to\r\n\nperform  the test, and a  small amount of  cocaine.  Although\r\n\nAlzate  offered the  jury  explanations for  the cocaine  and\r\n\nother  paraphernalia,   it  was  easily  within   the  jury's\r\n\ndiscretion to disbelieve him.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n",

We think that the first of the instructions quoted above--referring to a defendant with \"no previous intent to commit a crime\" who is \"persuaded ... by the Government\"--does convey the notion that the question posed was whether Alzate did have criminal intent before the government persuasion occurred.  While a more precisely tailored instruction might well have been suitable if specially sought, such refinements tailoring the language to the situation require that the judge be advised of the request.  We do not think that there was plain error in the charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also have little reason to think that the precise phrasing of the instruction affected the outcome.  Alzate did testify that he was repeatedly badgered by the informant, but his claims were not entirely borne out by what was recorded.  Moreover, Alzate, who had a beeper with him when he was arrested, also was found to have in his house an electronic scale, a kit for testing cocaine including a chemical used to perform the test, and a small amount of cocaine.  Although Alzate offered the jury explanations for the cocaine and other paraphernalia, it was easily within the jury's discretion to disbelieve him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
