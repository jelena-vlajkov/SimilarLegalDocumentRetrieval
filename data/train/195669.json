Appellant pleaded  guilty to  a two-\n                     \n\ncount indictment charging him with violations of 18 U.S.C.   \n\n846  and  841(a)(1) &amp;  (b)(1)(B)  concerning  a cocaine  base\n\nconspiracy.    Because  appellant  had a  prior  drug  felony\n\nconviction, he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of\n\nten years.  See   841(b)(1)(B).  The district court therefore\n               \n\nimposed  a  ten-year sentence.    Appellant's  only issue  on\n\nappeal is whether the district court had the authority to sua\n\nsponte  depart  downward  from  this  statutorily  prescribed\n\nminimum  term  of  imprisonment  based  on  the  \"substantial\n\nassistance\" he allegedly provided to the government.\n\n          It is well settled that  a refusal by the  district\n\ncourt to depart downward is not appealable.

This\n\njurisdiction rule, in  turn, is subject to  the \"equally well\n\nrecognized\" principle that \"appellate jurisdiction may attach\n\nin those few  situations where the lower court's decision not\n\nto depart is based on the court's mistaken view that it lacks\n\nthe legal  authority to consider  a departure.\"   Romolo, 937\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 22.\n\n          Both  U.S.S.G.    5K1.1  and  18  U.S.C.    3553(e)\n\ngovern downward departures based on a defendant's substantial\n\nassistance to the government.
