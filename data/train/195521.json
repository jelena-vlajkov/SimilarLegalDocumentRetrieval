Gaynor, Assistant  United States  Attorneys, on\n                      \nbrief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n                        July 27, 1994\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.  Defendant contends that the government\n                    \n\nbreached  its agreement to recommend a prison sentence at the\n\nlow end  of the \"applicable sentencing  guideline range\" when\n\nit recommended a  60-month sentence, the  statutory mandatory\n\nminimum penalty under 21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B), instead of a\n\n46-month  sentence, the  bottom  of offense  level  23.   The\n\ngovernment  did  not  violate  the  plea  agreement.    Under\n\nU.S.S.G.   5G1.1(b), \"[w]here a  statutorily required minimum\n\nsentence  is  greater  than  the maximum  of  the  applicable\n\nguideline  range, the  statutorily required  minimum sentence\n                                                             \n\nshall  be the  guideline sentence.\"    (Emphasis added.)   In\n                                 \n\nother  words,   under  U.S.S.G.     5G1.1(b),  the  statutory\n\nmandatory minimum sentence  became the \"applicable  guideline\n\nsentencing  range,\"  a  \"range\"  consisting  of  one  number.\n\nConsequently,  in  recommending   the  statutorily   required\n\nminimum  sentence, the  government did  not violate  the plea\n\nagreement.   We note,  moreover, that the  government pointed\n\nout  at the plea hearing -- and the defendant acknowledged --\n\nthat defendant faced a minimum five-year prison term.\n\n          Defendant  claims the  record  does  not show  that\n\ndefendant  understood the  plea  agreement.   On the  present\n\nrecord,  we   disagree.     Defendant  was  assisted   by  an\n\ninterpreter at the change of plea hearing.  Counsel indicated\n\nhe had conferred with  defendant several times about pleading\n\nguilty  and had  discussed the  process with  him  at length.\n\n                             -2-\n\nDefendant stated that he had read, understood, and signed the\n\nplea  agreement, and he acknowledged that he was subject to a\n\nminimum of five years in prison.   He also said he understood\n\nthat  the guideline  sentence could  not be  determined until\n\nafter the pre-sentence report was completed.  On this record,\n\ndefendant's claim  that, at the  time of pleading  guilty, he\n\nunderstood   he  would   receive  a   46-month  sentence   is\n\nunsupported.\n\n          Any  claim  of  ineffective assistance  of  counsel\n\npremised on counsel's having  promised a 46-month sentence or\n\nhaving  improperly coached defendant on how to respond at the\n\nplea  colloquy is not cognizable on direct appeal as it would\n\nrequire proof of  facts outside the  present record.
