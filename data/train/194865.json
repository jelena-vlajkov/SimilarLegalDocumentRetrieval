Phillips\n                                              \n\nappeals the  district court's  order of restitution  and the\n\ndistrict  court's  denial  of   his  request  to  substitute\n\ncounsel.  Phillips  also asks  this court to  set aside  his\n\nplea of guilty because it was involuntary. \n\n          We  have  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.     1291\n\n(1988).\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          On February 24, 1992,  Phillips pleaded guilty  to\n\none count of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.   1344 for\n\nmaking  materially  false  statements when  obtaining  a  $5\n\nmillion loan from  First American Bank (FAB)  to establish a\n\nmini-storage facility.  On \n\nMay  22, 1992,  the court  sentenced Phillips  to 24  months\n\nimprisonment1  and ordered  Phillips to  pay to  the Federal\n\nDeposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC) in  its  capacity as\n\nreceiver  of FAB the sum of $3,520,100 within three years of\n\nhis release from prison.\n\n                         DISCUSSION\n                                   \n\n          Phillips contends the district court erred when it\n\ndenied  his request  to substitute  counsel prior  to trial.\n\n                    \n\n1Phillips's  conduct did  not fall  under the  United States\nSentencing  Guidelines;  thus,  the district  court  did not\nimpose a term of supervised release.\n\n                            -2-\n\nPhillips also states he received ineffective assistance from\n\nhis  counsel and, therefore, this court should set aside his\n\nplea of guilty because it was involuntary.  Phillips further\n\nasserts  the district court erred when it ordered him to pay\n\nrestitution  to FAB for losses  that were not  caused by his\n\nconduct  and when it set  an amount of  restitution that was\n\nper se unreasonable.\n      \n\nSUBSTITUTION OF COUNSEL\n                       \n\n          Phillips contends the court  erred when it refused\n\nto substitute counsel  after Phillips asked the court  to do\n\nso by  letter dated February  10, 1992; however,  perusal of\n\nPhillips's letter reflects he merely expressed his desire to\n\navoid delay of trial and his concern about the timeliness of\n\nvarious motions filed  and to be  filed on  his behalf.   On\n\nFebruary 14, 1992,  the parties appeared before the court to\n\ndispose of certain pretrial matters.  At that time (ten days\n\nbefore  trial  was  scheduled  to begin),  the  court  asked\n\nPhillips whether he wanted  to elaborate on his  reasons for\n\nwriting  the  letter;  after  briefly  conferring  with  his\n\nattorney,  Phillips  told  the  court  he  was  \"pleased  to\n\nproceed.\"  The court asked Phillips a second time whether he\n\nwanted  to discuss  any  matters pertaining  to his  letter.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nAgain, Phillips did not complain about  his attorney nor did\n\nhe request a change of counsel; in fact, the record does not\n\nreflect Phillips requested  a change of counsel  at any time\n\nprior  to   entering  his   plea.2    We   find,  therefore,\n\nPhillips's contention  that the court denied  his request to\n\nsubstitute counsel has no factual basis.\n\nINVOLUNTARY PLEA\n                \n\n          Phillips  asserts his sentence should be set aside\n\nbecause   of   his  court-appointed   counsel's  ineffective\n\nassistance.    Phillips  specifically  refers  to  counsel's\n\nalleged misrepresentations, untimeliness in  filing motions,\n\nfailure to investigate,  and lack of preparation  on the day\n\nof trial.\n\n          We generally do not consider such claims on direct\n\nappeal  because issues  regarding ineffective  assistance of\n\ncounsel \"normally  require 'the resolution of factual issues\n\nas  well as  inquiries into  other evidentiary  matters that\n\ncannot  effectively be handled for the first time by a court\n\nof appeals.'\"   United States  v. Hallock, 941  F.2d 36,  43\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir. 1991).   The  matter before  us is  no exception;\n\n                    \n\n2When Phillips pleaded guilty on  February 24, 1992, he told\nthe court his attorney had \"been very good.\" \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nthus, we  decline  to  consider  Phillips's  contentions  of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal.\n\n          At oral argument, Phillips also contended his plea\n\nof guilty should be set aside because he was not informed by\n\ncounsel  or the  court at  the time  he pleaded  guilty that\n\nrestitution  could be imposed as  part of his  sentence.  We\n\nwill briefly address this issue even though Phillips did not\n\nmake the argument in his briefs.                Fed.      R.\n\nCrim.  P.  11(c)(1)  provides  that the  court  must  inform\n\ndefendant  of  the  maximum penalties,  which  includes  the\n\npossibility of  restitution, before defendant enters  a plea\n\nof guilty.  The record shows the district court reviewed the\n\nterms of the plea agreement in open court and asked Phillips\n\nwhether  he  understood  the  government   was  recommending\n\npayment of restitution in an amount to be  determined later.\n\nPhillips acknowledged  the terms  of the plea  agreement and\n\nindicated he understood the court did not have to follow the\n\ngovernment's recommendations.   We find, therefore, Phillips\n\nhas  no  basis  for  his  assertion   that  he  was  unaware\n\nrestitution could be imposed as part of his sentence.\n\nRESTITUTION\n           \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n          Phillips contends  the loss to FAB  was not wholly\n\ncaused by his\n\nconduct; therefore, the  court erred when it  ordered him to\n\npay  restitution.    Phillips  also  asserts  that  even  if\n\nrestitution  were  appropriate,  the  amount  of restitution\n\nordered by the court was incorrect and per se unreasonable.\n                                             \n\nResponsibility for loss. \n                       \n\n          Phillips contends  FAB's loss  was  caused by  (1)\n\nFAB's reliance  on the property valuation  of an independent\n\nappraiser as well as  Phillips's misrepresentations when the\n\nloan was made, (2)  FAB's mishandling of Phillips's business\n\nafter  it took  over,  and (3)  economic  forces beyond  the\n\ncontrol of either Phillips or FAB.\n\n          Under  the Victim  and  Witness Protection  Act of\n\n1982  (VWPA),  18  U.S.C.     3663-64  (1988  &amp;  Supp.1990),\n\nrestitution  is limited to \"the  loss caused by the specific\n\nconduct that is the basis of the ... conviction.\"  Hughey v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited  States, 495  U.S.  411, 413  (1990).   We  review  a\n              \n\ndetermination of victim loss for clear error.  United States\n                                                            \n\nv. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 617 (1st Cir. 1993).   \n         \n\n          At  the first  sentencing hearing,  the government\n\npresented evidence (business records and affidavits) showing\n\nthe devaluation of  the property was a  result of Phillips's\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nbad  faith, mismanagement,  and looting of  the mini-storage\n\nbusiness.  The court granted Phillips a continuance to allow\n\nhim to produce further evidence to support his position that\n\nrestitution  was inappropriate.   At  the second  sentencing\n\nhearing,   the   court   rejected   Phillips's   denial   of\n\nresponsibility for FAB's loss.  \n\n          When  he  pleaded  guilty,  Phillips  admitted  to\n\nproviding  FAB  with  materially  false   statements  (e.g.,\n\nomission of  his previous  filing for bankruptcy)  to obtain\n\nthe  loan to  establish a  mini-storage facility.   Phillips\n\nargues, however, the diminution  of the property's value was\n\ndue  primarily  to  the  bad management  of  the  bankruptcy\n\ntrustee  and FAB,  who, according  to Phillips,  managed the\n\nproperty jointly even though  the trustee had legal control.\n\n          In response,  the government  points out FAB  only\n\nhad  possession  of  the  property  for  a   few  days  from\n\napproximately January 6 to \n\nJanuary 17, 1989,  and began foreclosure proceedings  during\n\nthat  time.3  On or  about January 17,  1989, Phillips filed\n\nfor  bankruptcy once  again, and  the trustee  in bankruptcy\n\n                    \n\n3Phillips  does  not specifically  argue  the  value of  the\nproperty diminished between January 6 and January 17, 1989.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\ntook control of the property shortly  thereafter.  In August\n\n1989, the property  was sold  at auction by  the trustee  in\n\nbankruptcy;  Phillips points  out the  property's value  had\n\ndecreased  considerably by  then.4   The  sum of  $3,520,100\n\nrepresents  the  difference  between  the   $5  million  FAB\n\noriginally  loaned Phillips for  establishment of  the mini-\n\nstorage  facility  and  the  amount  FAB  received  for  the\n\nproperty.  \n\n          The  court  rejected  Phillips's  contentions  and\n\nfound  the government's  arguments persuasive  of Phillips's\n\nultimate responsibility for FAB's loss.  After reviewing the\n\nrecord, we concur with the court's conclusion that FAB would\n\nnot have incurred the loss \"but for\" the loan to Phillips, a\n\nloan     Phillips     obtained     by    making     material\n\nmisrepresentations.  We, therefore,  do not find the court's\n\nconclusion clearly erroneous.  \n\nAmount of loss.\n              \n\n          Phillips further  argues that even  if restitution\n\nwere appropriate, the court incorrectly calculated the loss.\n\nPhillips points out the correct calculation of loss would be\n\nthe value  of the property  \"less the value (as  of the date\n\n                    \n\n4The district court  noted it  was not the  proper forum  in\nwhich  to  initiate a  claim  of  mismanagement against  the\ntrustee in bankruptcy.\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nthe property is returned)  of any part of the  property that\n\nis returned.\"  \n\n18 U.S.C.    3663(b)(1).  The value  of the property  is its\n\nworth  on the date title  is transferred.   United States v.\n                                                         \n\nSmith,  944 F.2d 618, 625 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112\n                                                       \n\nS.Ct. 1515 (1992).   When  the amount of  loss is  disputed,\n\n\"the government  bears the  burden of  establishing it by  a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\"  Id.\n                                   \n\n          In Smith, the bank  took title to certain property\n                  \n\nwhen Smith defaulted on loans.  Before selling the property,\n\nthe bank  held it for a  long period in  a declining market.\n\nThe Smith court  found the property should  have been valued\n         \n\non  the  date the  bank  \"had the  power  to dispose  of the\n\nproperty  and  receive  compensation,\"  id.,  and  the  loss\n                                          \n\nrecognized by  the court should  have been  reduced by  that\n\namount.  In the matter before us, FAB took possession of the\n\nproperty   in   early   January   and    began   foreclosure\n\nproceedings.5   On or about January 17, 1989, Phillips filed\n\nfor bankruptcy; the  trustee in bankruptcy retained  control\n\nover   the  property  until   foreclosure  proceedings  were\n\ncompleted in August 1989.  Unlike the bank in Smith, FAB had\n                                                   \n\n                    \n\n5Again,  we note  Phillips does  not specifically  argue the\nvalue of the property diminished between January 6 and \nJanuary 17, 1989.\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nlittle  or no  time  to dispose  of  the property  in  early\n\nJanuary  since Phillips filed  bankruptcy almost immediately\n\nafter FAB took physical possession of the property.\n\n          After  considering  the  circumstances, the  court\n\nconcluded Phillips was responsible for  FAB's loss totalling\n\n$3,520,100, the \n\namount  still owing after the  property at the  heart of the\n\nloan was auctioned  by the  trustee in bankruptcy.6   We  do\n\nnot find the district court's conclusion clearly erroneous.\n\nReasonability of restitution order.\n                                  \n\n          Phillips  also  contends  the  court's  order  for\n\nrestitution was  per se  unreasonable because the  court did\n                       \n\nnot consider  all relevant factors required  by statute when\n\nit  ordered  payment of  restitution.    Phillips bases  his\n\nargument specifically  on the  court's  failure to  consider\n\nPhillips's ability to pay the restitution ordered.  \n\n          The VWPA does not prohibit a sentencing court from\n\nimposing restitution upon a defendant who is indigent at the\n\ntime.   United States v. Brown, 744 F.2d 905, 911 (2d Cir.),\n                              \n\ncert.  denied, 469 U.S. 1089 (1984).  A court must, however,\n             \n\n                    \n\n6Although  Phillips argues  the  worth of  the property  was\ngreater when he  relinquished control, this  appellate court\nis not the proper forum in which to challenge the bankruptcy\ntrustee's  competency  in  controlling or  disposing  of the\nproperty.\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\n\"consider ... the financial  resources of the defendant, the\n\nfinancial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the\n\ndefendant's dependents, and such  other factors as the court\n\ndeems appropriate.\"  18 U.S.C.   3664(a).  See, e.g., United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v. Ramilo, 986  F.2d 333, 336  (9th Cir. 1993).   In\n                 \n\nthis circuit,  a sentencing court  is not  required to  make\n\n\"open-court findings on the statutory factors when issuing a\n\nrestitution  order so long  as the record  on appeal reveals\n\nthat  the   judge  made   implicit  findings  or   otherwise\n\nadequately  evinced his  consideration  of  those  factors.\"\n\nSavoie, 985 F.2d at 11.  \n      \n\n          The record reflects Phillips brought the requisite\n\nfactors to  the attention  of  the court  in his  sentencing\n\nmemorandum  and  at  sentencing.7    The  court acknowledged\n\nthese  factors  and   concluded  Phillips  was  sufficiently\n\nresourceful  to  be capable  of paying  all,  or at  least a\n\nsubstantial portion,  of the restitution within  three years\n\nof  his release  from prison.   The  court made  no specific\n\nfindings to support its  conclusions; the absence of express\n\nfindings, however, is not fatal when the record reflects the\n\ncourt gave thought to the requisite factors.  Id. \n                                                \n\n                    \n\n7The  probation  officer  also  addressed  Phillips's future\nmoney-earning prospects in the PSR.\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n          When  the court ordered payment of restitution, it\n\nnoted  that Phillips was  smart and resourceful.   The court\n\nfurther remarked  that Phillips made  a great deal  of money\n\nonce,  and, in its opinion, Phillips was capable of making a\n\ngreat  deal of  money again.    Cf. Smith,  944 F.2d  at 623\n                                         \n\n(defendant ordered to pay $12.8 million to FSLIC within five\n\nyears of  his  release  from prison  based  on  the  court's\n\nobservation  that  defendant demonstrated  in  the past  his\n\nability to accumulate assets in this amount of restitution);\n\nUnited States v.

Sec. 1344 for making materially false statements when obtaining a $5 million loan from First American Bank (FAB) to establish a mini-storage facility.  On May 22, 1992, the court sentenced Phillips to 24 months imprisonment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and ordered Phillips to pay to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in its capacity as receiver of FAB the sum of $3,520,100 within three years of his release from prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips contends the district court erred when it denied his request to substitute counsel prior to trial.  Phillips also states he received ineffective assistance from his counsel and, therefore, this court should set aside his plea of guilty because it was involuntary.  Phillips further asserts the district court erred when it ordered him to pay restitution to FAB for losses that were not caused by his conduct and when it set an amount of restitution that was per se unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SUBSTITUTION OF COUNSEL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips contends the court erred when it refused to substitute counsel after Phillips asked the court to do so by letter dated February 10, 1992;  however, perusal of Phillips's letter reflects he merely expressed his desire to avoid delay of trial and his concern about the timeliness of various motions filed and to be filed on his behalf.  On February 14, 1992, the parties appeared before the court to dispose of certain pretrial matters.  At that time (ten days before trial was scheduled to begin), the court asked Phillips whether he wanted to elaborate on his reasons for writing the letter;  after briefly conferring with his attorney, Phillips told the court he was \"pleased to proceed.\"  The court asked Phillips a second time whether he wanted to discuss any matters pertaining to his letter.  Again, Phillips did not complain about his attorney nor did he request a change of counsel;  in fact, the record does not reflect Phillips requested a change of counsel at any time prior to entering his plea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We find, therefore, Phillips's contention that the court denied his request to substitute counsel has no factual basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>INVOLUNTARY PLEA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips asserts his sentence should be set aside because of his court-appointed counsel's ineffective assistance.  Phillips specifically refers to counsel's alleged misrepresentations, untimeliness in filing motions, failure to investigate, and lack of preparation on the day of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We generally do not consider such claims on direct appeal because issues regarding ineffective assistance of counsel \"normally require 'the resolution of factual issues as well as inquiries into other evidentiary matters that cannot effectively be handled for the first time by a court of appeals.' \"  United States v. Hallock, 941 F.2d 36, 43 (1st Cir. 1991).  The matter before us is no exception;  thus, we decline to consider Phillips's contentions of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Phillips also contended his plea of guilty should be set aside because he was not informed by counsel or the court at the time he pleaded guilty that restitution could be imposed as part of his sentence.  We will briefly address this issue even though Phillips did not make the argument in his briefs.  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 11(c)(1) provides that the court must inform defendant of the maximum penalties, which includes the possibility of restitution, before defendant enters a plea of guilty.  The record shows the district court reviewed the terms of the plea agreement in open court and asked Phillips whether he understood the government was recommending payment of restitution in an amount to be determined later.  Phillips acknowledged the terms of the plea agreement and indicated he understood the court did not have to follow the government's recommendations.  We find, therefore, Phillips has no basis for his assertion that he was unaware restitution could be imposed as part of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>RESTITUTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips contends the loss to FAB was not wholly caused by his @conduct;  therefore, the court erred when it ordered him to pay restitution.  Phillips also asserts that even if restitution were appropriate, the amount of restitution ordered by the court was incorrect and per se unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Responsibility for loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips contends FAB's loss was caused by (1) FAB's reliance on the property valuation of an independent appraiser as well as Phillips's misrepresentations when the loan was made, (2) FAB's mishandling of Phillips's business after it took over, and (3) economic forces beyond the control of either Phillips or FAB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), 18 U.S.C. Secs. 3663-64 (1988 &amp; Supp.1990), restitution is limited to \"the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the ... conviction.\"   Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 413 (1990).  We review a determination of victim loss for clear error.  United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 617 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the first sentencing hearing, the government presented evidence (business records and affidavits) showing the devaluation of the property was a result of Phillips's bad faith, mismanagement, and looting of the mini-storage business.  The court granted Phillips a continuance to allow him to produce further evidence to support his position that restitution was inappropriate.  At the second sentencing hearing, the court rejected Phillips's denial of responsibility for FAB's loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he pleaded guilty, Phillips admitted to providing FAB with materially false statements (e.g., omission of his previous filing for bankruptcy) to obtain the loan to establish a mini-storage facility.  Phillips argues, however, the diminution of the property's value was due primarily to the bad management of the bankruptcy trustee and FAB, who, according to Phillips, managed the property jointly even though the trustee had legal control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the government points out FAB only had possession of the property for a few days from approximately January 6 to January 17, 1989, and began foreclosure proceedings during that time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  On or about January 17, 1989, Phillips filed for bankruptcy once again, and the trustee in bankruptcy took control of the property shortly thereafter.  In August 1989, the property was sold at auction by the trustee in bankruptcy;  Phillips points out the property's value had decreased considerably by then.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The sum of $3,520,100 represents the difference between the $5 million FAB originally loaned Phillips for establishment of the mini-storage facility and the amount FAB received for the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected Phillips's contentions and found the government's arguments persuasive of Phillips's ultimate responsibility for FAB's loss.  After reviewing the record, we concur with the court's conclusion that FAB would not have incurred the loss \"but for\" the loan to Phillips, a loan Phillips obtained by making material misrepresentations.  We, therefore, do not find the court's conclusion clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Amount of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips further argues that even if restitution were appropriate, the court incorrectly calculated the loss.  Phillips points out the correct calculation of loss would be the value of the property \"less the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. Sec. 3663(b)(1).  The value of the property is its worth on the date title is transferred.  United States v. Smith, 944 F.2d 618, 625 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 1515 (1992).  When the amount of loss is disputed, \"the government bears the burden of establishing it by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Smith, the bank took title to certain property when Smith defaulted on loans.  Before selling the property, the bank held it for a long period in a declining market.  The Smith court found the property should have been valued on the date the bank \"had the power to dispose of the property and receive compensation,\" id., and the loss recognized by the court should have been reduced by that amount.  In the matter before us, FAB took possession of the property in early January and began foreclosure proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On or about January 17, 1989, Phillips filed for bankruptcy;  the trustee in bankruptcy retained control over the property until foreclosure proceedings were completed in August 1989.  Unlike the bank in Smith, FAB had little or no time to dispose of the property in early January since Phillips filed bankruptcy almost immediately after FAB took physical possession of the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the circumstances, the court concluded Phillips was responsible for FAB's loss totalling $3,520,100, the amount still owing after the property at the heart of the loan was auctioned by the trustee in bankruptcy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We do not find the district court's conclusion clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>Reasonability of restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips also contends the court's order for restitution was per se unreasonable because the court did not consider all relevant factors required by statute when it ordered payment of restitution.  Phillips bases his argument specifically on the court's failure to consider Phillips's ability to pay the restitution ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VWPA does not prohibit a sentencing court from imposing restitution upon a defendant who is indigent at the time.  United States v. Brown, 744 F.2d 905, 911 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1089 (1984).  A court must, however, \"consider ... the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3664(a).  See, e.g., United States v. Ramilo, 986 F.2d 333, 336 (9th Cir. 1993).  In this circuit, a sentencing court is not required to make \"open-court findings on the statutory factors when issuing a restitution order so long as the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his consideration of those factors.\"  Savoie, 985 F.2d at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects Phillips brought the requisite factors to the attention of the court in his sentencing memorandum and at sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The court acknowledged these factors and concluded Phillips was sufficiently resourceful to be capable of paying all, or at least a substantial portion, of the restitution within three years of his release from prison.  The court made no specific findings to support its conclusions;  the absence of express findings, however, is not fatal when the record reflects the court gave thought to the requisite factors.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the court ordered payment of restitution, it noted that Phillips was smart and resourceful.  The court further remarked that Phillips made a great deal of money once, and, in its opinion, Phillips was capable of making a great deal of money again.  Cf. Smith, 944 F.2d at 623 (defendant ordered to pay $12.8 million to FSLIC within five years of his release from prison based on the court's observation that defendant demonstrated in the past his ability to accumulate assets in this amount of restitution); United States v. Rogat, 924 F.2d 983, 986 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S.Ct. 1637 (1991) (indigent defendants were ordered to pay restitution of approximately $2.5 million based on the fact both were \"able, intelligent, well-educated, talented business people, who do have substantial capacity to earn money now or in the future, and, therefore, do have ability to make restitution\").  The VWPA itself demands only that the sentencing court \"consider\" the factors enumerated therein, Savoie, 985 F.2d at 11;  the record reflects this sentencing court had before it information bearing on these factors.  Although another court may have reached a different conclusion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> we do not find the sentencing court abused its discretion.  To paraphrase Judge Selya in Savoie, \"[w]e have said enough,\" maybe even too much.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing, we find the district court did not err when it ordered Phillips to pay restitution in the amount of $3,520,100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>*Of the District of Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Phillips's conduct did not fall under the United States Sentencing Guidelines;  thus, the district court did not impose a term of supervised release</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> When Phillips pleaded guilty on February 24, 1992, he told the court his attorney had \"been very good.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Phillips does not specifically argue the value of the property diminished between January 6 and January 17, 1989</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court noted it was not the proper forum in which to initiate a claim of mismanagement against the trustee in bankruptcy</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Again, we note Phillips does not specifically argue the value of the property diminished between January 6 and January 17, 1989</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although Phillips argues the worth of the property was greater when he relinquished control, this appellate court is not the proper forum in which to challenge the bankruptcy trustee's competency in controlling or disposing of the property</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The probation officer also addressed Phillips's future money-earning prospects in the PSR</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> According to Phillips, he carries a staggering debt of more than $36 million after being denied discharge in bankruptcy.  The family's current income is apparently limited to his wife's earnings as a nurse's aide and the pittance Phillips may be able to earn while imprisoned.  To pay the restitution alone, Phillips will have to make profits greatly exceeding $3.5 million (legitimately, we presume) within three years of his release from a two-year stint in prison.  We note Phillips's resourcefulness in the past does not necessarily promise the same success in the future-at least, we hope not;  after all, his past \"resourcefulness\" led him to this court</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 1344 for making materially false statements when obtaining a $5 million loan from First American Bank (FAB) to establish a mini-storage facility.  On May 22, 1992, the court sentenced Phillips to 24 months imprisonment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and ordered Phillips to pay to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in its capacity as receiver of FAB the sum of $3,520,100 within three years of his release from prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips contends the district court erred when it denied his request to substitute counsel prior to trial.  Phillips also states he received ineffective assistance from his counsel and, therefore, this court should set aside his plea of guilty because it was involuntary.  Phillips further asserts the district court erred when it ordered him to pay restitution to FAB for losses that were not caused by his conduct and when it set an amount of restitution that was per se unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SUBSTITUTION OF COUNSEL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips contends the court erred when it refused to substitute counsel after Phillips asked the court to do so by letter dated February 10, 1992;  however, perusal of Phillips's letter reflects he merely expressed his desire to avoid delay of trial and his concern about the timeliness of various motions filed and to be filed on his behalf.  On February 14, 1992, the parties appeared before the court to dispose of certain pretrial matters.  At that time (ten days before trial was scheduled to begin), the court asked Phillips whether he wanted to elaborate on his reasons for writing the letter;  after briefly conferring with his attorney, Phillips told the court he was \"pleased to proceed.\"  The court asked Phillips a second time whether he wanted to discuss any matters pertaining to his letter.  Again, Phillips did not complain about his attorney nor did he request a change of counsel;  in fact, the record does not reflect Phillips requested a change of counsel at any time prior to entering his plea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We find, therefore, Phillips's contention that the court denied his request to substitute counsel has no factual basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>INVOLUNTARY PLEA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips asserts his sentence should be set aside because of his court-appointed counsel's ineffective assistance.  Phillips specifically refers to counsel's alleged misrepresentations, untimeliness in filing motions, failure to investigate, and lack of preparation on the day of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We generally do not consider such claims on direct appeal because issues regarding ineffective assistance of counsel \"normally require 'the resolution of factual issues as well as inquiries into other evidentiary matters that cannot effectively be handled for the first time by a court of appeals.' \"  United States v. Hallock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566307\"><a href=\"/opinion/566307/united-states-v-carl-hallock/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 1991).  The matter before us is no exception;  thus, we decline to consider Phillips's contentions of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Phillips also contended his plea of guilty should be set aside because he was not informed by counsel or the court at the time he pleaded guilty that restitution could be imposed as part of his sentence.  We will briefly address this issue even though Phillips did not make the argument in his briefs.  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 11(c)(1) provides that the court must inform defendant of the maximum penalties, which includes the possibility of restitution, before defendant enters a plea of guilty.  The record shows the district court reviewed the terms of the plea agreement in open court and asked Phillips whether he understood the government was recommending payment of restitution in an amount to be determined later.  Phillips acknowledged the terms of the plea agreement and indicated he understood the court did not have to follow the government's recommendations.  We find, therefore, Phillips has no basis for his assertion that he was unaware restitution could be imposed as part of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>RESTITUTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips contends the loss to FAB was not wholly caused by his @conduct;  therefore, the court erred when it ordered him to pay restitution.  Phillips also asserts that even if restitution were appropriate, the amount of restitution ordered by the court was incorrect and per se unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Responsibility for loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips contends FAB's loss was caused by (1) FAB's reliance on the property valuation of an independent appraiser as well as Phillips's misrepresentations when the loan was made, (2) FAB's mishandling of Phillips's business after it took over, and (3) economic forces beyond the control of either Phillips or FAB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA), 18 U.S.C. Secs. 3663-64 (1988 &amp; Supp.1990), restitution is limited to \"the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the ... conviction.\"   Hughey v.

The court granted Phillips a continuance to allow him to produce further evidence to support his position that restitution was inappropriate.  At the second sentencing hearing, the court rejected Phillips's denial of responsibility for FAB's loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he pleaded guilty, Phillips admitted to providing FAB with materially false statements (e.g., omission of his previous filing for bankruptcy) to obtain the loan to establish a mini-storage facility.  Phillips argues, however, the diminution of the property's value was due primarily to the bad management of the bankruptcy trustee and FAB, who, according to Phillips, managed the property jointly even though the trustee had legal control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the government points out FAB only had possession of the property for a few days from approximately January 6 to January 17, 1989, and began foreclosure proceedings during that time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  On or about January 17, 1989, Phillips filed for bankruptcy once again, and the trustee in bankruptcy took control of the property shortly thereafter.  In August 1989, the property was sold at auction by the trustee in bankruptcy;  Phillips points out the property's value had decreased considerably by then.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The sum of $3,520,100 represents the difference between the $5 million FAB originally loaned Phillips for establishment of the mini-storage facility and the amount FAB received for the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected Phillips's contentions and found the government's arguments persuasive of Phillips's ultimate responsibility for FAB's loss.  After reviewing the record, we concur with the court's conclusion that FAB would not have incurred the loss \"but for\" the loan to Phillips, a loan Phillips obtained by making material misrepresentations.  We, therefore, do not find the court's conclusion clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Amount of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips further argues that even if restitution were appropriate, the court incorrectly calculated the loss.  Phillips points out the correct calculation of loss would be the value of the property \"less the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C.

Before selling the property, the bank held it for a long period in a declining market.  The Smith court found the property should have been valued on the date the bank \"had the power to dispose of the property and receive compensation,\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.,</span> and the </span>loss recognized by the court should have been reduced by that amount.  In the matter before us, FAB took possession of the property in early January and began foreclosure proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On or about January 17, 1989, Phillips filed for bankruptcy;  the trustee in bankruptcy retained control over the property until foreclosure proceedings were completed in August 1989.  Unlike the bank in Smith, FAB had little or no time to dispose of the property in early January since Phillips filed bankruptcy almost immediately after FAB took physical possession of the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the circumstances, the court concluded Phillips was responsible for FAB's loss totalling $3,520,100, the amount still owing after the property at the heart of the loan was auctioned by the trustee in bankruptcy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We do not find the district court's conclusion clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>Reasonability of restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips also contends the court's order for restitution was per se unreasonable because the court did not consider all relevant factors required by statute when it ordered payment of restitution.  Phillips bases his argument specifically on the court's failure to consider Phillips's ability to pay the restitution ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VWPA does not prohibit a sentencing court from imposing restitution upon a defendant who is indigent at the time.

In this circuit, a sentencing court is not required to make \"open-court findings on the statutory factors when issuing a restitution order so long as the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his consideration of those factors.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Savoie,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects Phillips brought the requisite factors to the attention of the court in his sentencing memorandum and at sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The court acknowledged these factors and concluded Phillips was sufficiently resourceful to be capable of paying all, or at least a substantial portion, of the restitution within three years of his release from prison.

To pay the restitution alone, Phillips will have to make profits greatly exceeding $3.5 million (legitimately, we presume) within three years of his release from a two-year stint in prison.  We note Phillips's resourcefulness in the past does not necessarily promise the same success in the future-at least, we hope not;  after all, his past \"resourcefulness\" led him to this court</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
