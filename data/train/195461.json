(collectively \"Honda\").   A jury found Honda\n\nliable  and  awarded  plaintiff  $9,652,000  in  compensatory\n\ndamages.   This amount  was reduced to  $8,204,200 to account\n\nfor  plaintiff's  comparative  negligence.    In  a  separate\n\nproceeding, the  district court granted judgment  as a matter\n\nof law for  Honda on plaintiff's claim for  punitive damages.\n\nHonda appeals from the judgment of liability and compensatory\n\ndamages.   Plaintiff  cross-appeals on  its punitive  damages\n\nclaim.\n\n          Finding reversible error, we vacate the judgment of\n\nliability  and remand  for a  new trial  as to  all liability\n\nissues.  If  Honda is found liable  on retrial, the award  of\n\ndamages   stands.    As  for  plaintiff's  cross-appeal,  the\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          On Saturday,  March 11, 1989, the  course of Arthur\n\nLaPlante's  life was  dramatically and  irreversibly altered.\n\nOn  that  morning  plaintiff,  a  twenty-four  year-old  army\n\nmechanic  stationed  at  Fort  Carson,  Colorado,  and  three\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nfriends,  Kelly  Kallhoff,  Randy  Leib,   and  Mike  Mohawk,\n\nventured to  nearby Pikes  Peak in order  to ride  Kallhoff's\n\nthree-wheel ATV, a  1982 Honda ATC200.  This ATV  is a three-\n\nwheeled  motorized vehicle  intended for  off-road use.   The\n\nvehicle has  handlebar steering and large low-pressure tires,\n\ntwo in the rear, and one in front.\n\n          Plaintiff, who had never  before ridden an ATV, was\n\nthe third to ride after Kallhoff and Leib.  After climbing to\n\nthe top of a knoll, plaintiff  began to descend at a speed of\n\n5-10 m.p.h.  When  plaintiff was unable to negotiate  a left-\n\nhand turn onto a twelve  foot wide dirt road, he fell  over a\n\nsteep embankment  and broke his neck,  resulting in permanent\n\nparalysis from the neck down.\n\n          On January 11, 1991,  plaintiff, who lived in Rhode\n\nIsland  before enlisting  in  the Army  in 1983  and returned\n\nthere after the accident,  commenced this diversity action in\n\nthe  United States District  Court for the  District of Rhode\n\nIsland.   The complaint delineated six causes of action:  (1)\n\nbreach  of  warranty;  (2) false  advertising;  (3) negligent\n\nfailure to advise  how to operate the vehicle;  (4) negligent\n\nfailure to warn; (5) strict  liability design defect; and (6)\n\nwillful,   wanton  and   reckless  conduct   (i.e.,  punitive\n                                                  \n\ndamages).   The  trial was  bifurcated so  that the  issue of\n\npunitive damages could be tried after the issues of liability\n\nand  compensatory  damages.    The  parties  agree  that  the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nsubstantive law of Rhode  Island governs the liability issues\n\nin this action.  \n\n          A   twenty-three  day   trial   on  liability   and\n\ncompensatory damages began  in July  1993.  At  the close  of\n\nplaintiff's case Honda moved for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nOnly  the claims  for  negligent failure  to warn  and strict\n\nliability design defect survived  the motion.  Ultimately the\n\njury found  Honda  liable on  these two  claims, and  awarded\n\nplaintiff $3,652,000 for medical expenses and lost wages, and\n\n$6,000,000 for physical injuries and pain and suffering.  The\n\njury also found  that plaintiff was  comparatively negligent,\n\nand reduced his award by fifteen percent.  The district court\n\ndenied Honda's motions for postjudgment relief.\n\n          The punitive damages phase of this action commenced\n\non September  16, 1993.   On  the same day,  at the  close of\n\nplaintiff's  evidence, the  district  court  granted  Honda's\n\nmotion  for judgment as a matter of law.  These cross-appeals\n\nensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  Rhode Island's Subsequent Alteration Statute\n                                                \n\n          Honda  argues that  the  district  court  committed\n\nreversible  error   by  not  instructing  the   jury  on  the\n\naffirmative  defense provided  by Rhode  Island's \"subsequent\n\nalteration\" statute, R.I. Gen. Laws   9-1-32 (1985).\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Rhode Island law  provides that \"[n]o  manufacturer\n\nor  seller of a product shall be liable for product liability\n\ndamages where  a substantial cause  of the injury,  death, or\n                                                 \n\ndamage was  a subsequent  alteration or modification.\"   R.I.\n\nGen. Laws   9-1-32(b) (emphasis  added).  The statute defines\n\n\"subsequent alteration or modification\" as\n\n          an  alteration  or   modification  of   a\n          product    made    subsequent   to    the\n          manufacture or sale  by the  manufacturer\n          or  seller  which  altered, modified,  or\n          changed   the  purpose,   use,  function,\n          design, or  manner of use of  the product\n          from that originally designed,  tested or\n          intended  by  the  manufacturer,  or  the\n          purpose, use, function, design, or manner\n          of  use  or intended  use for  which such\n          product  was originally  designed, tested\n          or manufactured.\n\nId.     9-1-32(a)(2).    Honda  contends  that  it  presented\n   \n\nevidence  that  the ATV  ridden by  plaintiff was  altered or\n\nmodified  after its  original sale,  and therefore  the trial\n\ncourt's  failure to instruct the jury in accordance with   9-\n\n1-32  was reversible error.  In support of its position Honda\n\npoints to evidence  that, at  the time of  the accident,  the\n\nATV's  front brakes  were  inoperable, its  rear brakes  were\n\nfaulty, its right rear tire was overinflated, its front forks\n\nwere bent, and it pulled to the right.\n\n          Plaintiff's  response  is   fourfold.    First,  he\n\nmaintains   that  \"lax   maintenance\"  cannot   constitute  a\n\n\"subsequent  alteration or  modification\" under  the statute.\n\nRather,  plaintiff  insists that     9-1-32  was intended  to\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n\"provide a  defense when  someone has deliberately  altered a\n\nmachine. .  . .\"   Next,  he argues that  the statute  merely\n\ncodified  comment  g  of  Section  402A  of  the  Restatement\n\n(Second) of  Torts.  Third, plaintiff contends  that the jury\n\ncharge adequately  apprised the  jurors of Rhode  Island law.\n\nFinally, he argues that any error was harmless  because Honda\n\nfailed to present sufficient evidence that any of the alleged\n\nsubsequent alterations was a substantial cause of plaintiff's\n\ninjuries.\n\n          With respect to the  scope of the statute,  we have\n\nbeen unable  to find  any support for  plaintiff's contention\n\nthat  the  scope  of      9-1-32  is  limited  to  deliberate\n\nalterations, such  as the removal of safety  guards, and does\n\nnot reach \"alterations\" or \"modifications\" that have resulted\n\nfrom inadequate maintenance.  It is well settled  under Rhode\n\nIsland  law  that   \"[i]n  the  event   that  a  statute   is\n\nunambiguous, it  is  necessary for  this court  to apply  its\n\nterms  literally.\"  Keenan v.  Vose, 634 A.2d  866, 868 (R.I.\n                                   \n\n1993); see also Costello v. American Univ. Ins. Co., 633 A.2d\n                                                   \n\n260 (R.I. 1993)  (where statute \"has a plain  and unambiguous\n\nmeaning . . . this court  is bound to construe the statute in\n\naccordance  with  that meaning\");  Levesque  v.  Rhode Island\n                                                             \n\nDep't  of Transp.,  626  A.2d 1286,  1289  (R.I. 1993)  (when\n                 \n\nstatute is  clear and unambiguous  on its  face courts  \"must\n\ngive  the  words of  the  statute  their  plain  and  obvious\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nmeaning\").   Here,  plaintiff's proposed  limitation directly\n\ncontradicts  the  unambiguous  and  broad  language   of  the\n\nstatute.  No  exception has  been drawn by  the Rhode  Island\n\nlegislature   for   alterations  resulting   from  inadequate\n\nmaintenance as opposed to deliberate changes, and we can find\n\nno  principled reason for reading such  an exception into the\n\nstatute.\n\n          Several  states  have  enacted comparable  statutes\n\nthat  specifically   include  \"failure  to   observe  routine\n\nmaintenance\" within  the meaning of  subsequent alteration or\n\nmodification.  See, e.g.,  Ky. Rev.  Stat. Ann.    411.320(1)\n                        \n\n(\"product alteration or modification shall include failure to\n\nobserve routine  care and maintenance, but  shall not include\n\nordinary  wear and tear\"); N.C. Gen Stat.   99B-3 (same); see\n                                                             \n\nalso Lamb By  Shepard v. Sears,  Roebuck &amp; Co., 1  F.3d 1184,\n                                              \n\n1188 (11th Cir.  1993) (under Georgia, law failure to observe\n\nroutine  care  and  maintenance  can  constitute  a  material\n\nalteration   or   modification   insulating  defendant   from\n\nliability for defective design).  We have failed, however, to\n\nuncover a single statute that excludes inadequate maintenance\n\nfrom the  category of  subsequent alteration  or modification\n\nfor purposes of  this defense.   Finally, given the  apparent\n\npurpose  of    9-1-32,  i.e., to  protect manufacturers  from\n                            \n\nunanticipated risks  created by alterations  or modifications\n\noccurring after a product leaves their control, we can see no\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nreason  why  the Rhode  Island  legislature  would provide  a\n\ndefendant  with  a  complete   defense  where  an  ATV  owner\n\ndisconnected his front brakes, but not where the front brakes\n\nwere  inoperative  due  to  the owner's  failure  to  perform\n\nroutine maintenance.\n\n          Next,  plaintiff   argues  that      9-1-32  merely\n\ncodifies  the essence  of comment  g to  Section 402A  of the\n\nRestatement (Second) of  Torts which  provides, in  pertinent\n\npart, that \"[t]he seller  is not liable when he  delivers the\n\nproduct in  a safe  condition, and subsequent  mishandling or\n\nother causes make  it harmful  by the time  it is  consumed.\"\n\nPlaintiff points to no  language in   9-1-32 to  support this\n\nargument.  Rather, plaintiff  relies solely upon the presence\n\nof   9-1-32  in two  string citations,   i.e., Model  Uniform\n                                             \n\nProduct Liability Act   112(D), analysis (1979) (citing    9-\n\n1-32 among statutes that  have \"enacted the essence of  . . .\n\ncomment [g]  into law\"); Robinson v.  Reed-Prentice Div., 403\n                                                        \n\nN.E.2d 440,  443 (N.Y. 1980) (citing   9-1-32 for proposition\n\nthat  \"[s]ubsequent  modifications  of  a  product  from  its\n\noriginal condition  by  a third  party  which render  a  safe\n\nproduct  defective   are  not   the  responsibility   of  the\n\nmanufacturer\"), as support for this statutory interpretation.\n\n          The  plain  meaning of     9-1-32  simply does  not\n\nsupport  the proposition for which  it is cited  by either of\n\nthe above sources.   Neither authority explains the inclusion\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nof   9-1-32 in  its respective string citation, nor  does the\n\ntext of the statute bear even a modest resemblance to comment\n\ng of  the Restatement.   The statute  means what it  says and\n\nmust be applied.  Plaintiff's attempt to limit the  statute's\n\nbreadth by relying on these two citations is unavailing.\n\n          The next  question is  whether the jury  charge was\n\ndeficient.  We  examine jury instructions with an eye towards\n\ndetermining if \"they adequately explained the law or `whether\n\nthey  tended to  confuse or  mislead the jury  on controlling\n\nissues.'\"   Davet  v. Maccarone,  973 F.2d  22, 26  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n1992)  (quoting Brown v.  Trustees of Boston  Univ., 891 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n337, 353  (1st Cir.  1989), cert.  denied, 496  U.S. (1990)).\n                                         \n\nThe judge's  instructions on  strict liability were  that the\n\nplaintiff  must  prove,  inter  alia, that  the  product  was\n                                    \n\ndefective,  and \"that  the  defect existed  at  the time  the\n\nproduct  left the Defendant's hands.\"   In elaborating on the\n\nlatter point, the judge stated:\n\n               The  manufacturer  or seller  is not\n          responsible  for  defects resulting  from\n          changes  made to  its  product  by  other\n          persons over whom it had no control after\n          the   product    left   the   Defendant's\n          possession.\n               Therefore,   in    order   for   the\n          Plaintiff  to  prevail   on  his   strict\n          liability claim, the Plaintiff must prove\n          that the defect  that caused his injuries\n          existed at the time the product  left the\n          Defendant's  control.    That   does  not\n          necessarily  mean  that the  product must\n          have  been in exactly  the same condition\n          at  the time  of the  injury that  it was\n          when  it  left  the Defendant's  control.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          What it does mean is  that the particular\n          defect for  which the Plaintiff  seeks to\n          hold  the manufacturer  responsible, must\n          have existed at the time the product left\n          the Defendant's control.\n\nTrial Transcript of August 19, 1993 at 12-13.  The judge then\n\ninstructed the jury that the  plaintiff was required to prove\n\nthat the defect proximately caused his injuries:\n\n          That does not mean  that a defect must be\n          the only  or the last cause  of an injury\n          in order  to  be considered  a  proximate\n          cause.   It may be considered a proximate\n          cause if  it operates together  with some\n          other  contemporaneous  cause to  produce\n          the injury.   In such  cases, both causes\n          may be  considered proximate causes.   If\n          the two of  them act together  to produce\n          the  injury, you could have two proximate\n          causes.\n               [A]  defect  must  be,  at  least, a\n          substantial   contributing   factor    in\n          producing the  injury in order  for it to\n          be  considered a proximate  cause of that\n          injury.  In other  words, there must be a\n          reasonable connection  between the defect\n          and the injury that is being claimed.\n\nId. at 14.\n   \n\n          Although  consistent with the prevailing common law\n\nrule  governing  strict liability  design  defect  actions in\n\nRhode Island, see Ritter v. Narragansett Elec. Co.,  283 A.2d\n                                                  \n\n255, 262-63  (R.I. 1971), the  judge's instructions  directly\n\ncontradict   9-1-32.  Under  the statute, where a  subsequent\n\nalteration  or modification  to a  product is  a \"substantial\n\ncause\" of a plaintiff's injuries, the defendant is completely\n\nimmune  from a products  liability claim even  if the product\n\nwas defective  at the time  it left the  defendant's control,\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nand  the  defect was  a  proximate cause  of  the plaintiff's\n\ninjuries.  Despite the evidence in this case that changes had\n\nbeen made to the ATV between the time of its initial sale and\n\nthe  time  of  plaintiff's  accident, this  defense  was  not\n\ncommunicated  to  the jury.    Under  the circumstances,  the\n\ndistrict  court erred  in refusing  to give  Honda's proposed\n\ninstructions.1\n\n          There is one additional step  to our analysis.   As\n\nplaintiff correctly points out,  a finding of error does  not\n\n                    \n\n1.  Honda timely objected to  the district court's refusal to\ngive several of its proposed jury instructions:\n\n          [1] [T]he  Honda defendants shall  not be\n          held liable for product liability damages\n          where a substantial cause of the accident\n          was    a    subsequent   alteration    or\n          modification of the all terrain vehicle.\n\n          [2]  [F]ailure  to properly  maintain the\n          braking system, steering system and other\n          safety   related  items   can  constitute\n          alteration  or  modification  of the  all\n          terrain vehicle.\n\n          [3]  [I]f you  find  that certain  safety\n          related items on the all  terrain vehicle\n          were   improperly  maintained   and  this\n          improper  maintenance  created  a  danger\n          that  was  a  substantial  cause  of  Mr.\n          LaPlante's injuries  . . . then  you must\n          find the Honda  defendants are not liable\n          for plaintiff's injuries.\n\nAppellants'  Second Supplemental  Jury  Instructions at  1-2.\nPlaintiff argues that the above request was defective because\nHonda did not label  it as an affirmative defense.   Assuming\nplaintiff  is correct, the judge  still had a  duty to submit\nthe statutory defense to the jury.  See Jerlyn Yacht Sales v.\n                                                          \nRoman Yacht Brokerage, 950 F.2d 60, 69 n.16 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                     \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nnecessarily  warrant  reversal.     An  instructional   error\n\nrequires  reversal only where  the error is  determined to be\n\nprejudicial based on a whole-record  review.

An\n                     \n\nerror  is prejudicial if it could have affected the result of\n\nthe jury's deliberations.  Allen v. Chance Mfg. Co., 873 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n465,  469  (1st Cir.  1989).   At  trial Honda  adduced ample\n\nevidence  that  the  ATV  ridden  by  plaintiff was  in  poor\n\ncondition  on the day of  the accident.   Most significant is\n\nthe undisputed fact that the ATV's front brakes did not work.\n\nIn addition, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have\n\nfound that,  at the time  of the accident,  the ATV  had bent\n\nfront  forks, severely  maladjusted  rear  brakes,  unequally\n\ninflated rear tires, and pulled to the right.2\n\n          A rational jury,  presented with Honda's subsequent\n\nalteration defense, could have  found that any or all  of the\n\nalleged alterations or  modifications \"substantially  caused\"\n\nplaintiff's    injuries.       Consequently,    the   court's\n\ninstructional  error could  have changed  the outcome  of the\n\ntrial.   Honda  was  not  only  entitled  to  have  the  jury\n\n                    \n\n2.  To  underscore the  poor condition  of the  ATV, Sergeant\nJames Shirley, its owner prior to Kallhoff, testified that he\npaid only  $25 for the  ATV.   Trial Transcript of  August 2,\n1993, Morning Session at 49.   In addition, Shirley testified\nthat  he did not make any significant repairs to the vehicle,\nand that  the vehicle's condition appeared  unchanged when he\nsaw it one week prior to the accident. Id. at 53, 56.\n                                          \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\ninstructed  on  this  defense, but  it  is  evident that  the\n\ncourt's failure to give the instruction was reversible error.\n\n          Plaintiff  raises  one  additional   argument  that\n\nwarrants brief  discussion.   He maintains that  the district\n\ncourt's failure to give  a subsequent alteration charge, even\n\nif reversible error, has no bearing on the  negligent failure\n\nto warn claim.  This argument fails for two reasons.   First,\n\n  9-1-32 expressly covers  failure to warn claims as  well as\n\ndesign  defect  claims.     R.I.  Gen.  Laws     9-1-32(a)(1)\n\n(\"product  liability damages\"  includes damages  for personal\n\ninjuries  sustained  by reason  of  an  alleged  defect in  a\n\nproduct  or an  alleged failure  to warn  against a  danger).\n\nSecond,  the  case cited  by  plaintiff as  support  for this\n\nproposition, Witthauer v. Burkhart Roentgen, Inc., 467 N.W.2d\n                                                 \n\n439 (N.D.  1991), is  clearly distinguishable.   In Witthauer\n                                                             \n\nthe court held  that a North Dakota statute similar to   9-1-\n\n32  did not provide manufacturers with a defense to claims of\n\nnegligent  failure to  warn  consumers of  dangers caused  by\n\nforeseeable alterations or modifications to a product.  Here,\n\nplaintiff's claim is that Honda failed to warn him of dangers\n\ncaused  by  the  ATV's  original  design  defect,  not  by  a\n\nforeseeable   modification   or  alteration.     Accordingly,\n\nWitthauer is  inapposite.   We  have  considered  plaintiff's\n         \n\nother  arguments anent   9-1-32  and find them  to be without\n\nmerit.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nB.  Scope of Retrial\n                    \n\n          This leaves  us with  the question of  which issues\n\nshould be retried.   It is well settled that  \"[a]n appellate\n\ncourt has broad discretion to remand for a new trial  on all,\n\nor only some, of the issues in the case.\"  Dopp v. HTP Corp.,\n                                                            \n\n947 F.2d  506, 518 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (collecting cases);  see\n                                                             \n\nalso Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a) (permitting a new trial on \"all or\n    \n\npart  of the  issues\").   A new  trial may  not,  however, be\n\nlimited  to  fewer  than all  the  issues  unless  it clearly\n\nappears that the  issues to  be retried are  so distinct  and\n\nseparable  from the other issues that a trial of those issues\n\nalone may  be had without  injustice.  See  Gasoline Products\n                                                             \n\nCo.  v.  Champlin Refining  Co.,  283 U.S.  494,  500 (1931);\n                               \n\nKassel v.

On balance, we do\n\nnot  think that a new trial limited to Honda's liability, but\n\nexcluding  the  extent  of  its  liability,  would  be  fair.\n\nMoreover, comparative negligence is  regarded as a  liability\n\nconcept.  See Winn v. Lafayette Town House, 839 F.2d 835, 837\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1988); Akermanis v.

See Allen,  873 F.2d  at  473-74 (new  trial on\n                       \n\nliability only  where error  did not affect  determination of\n\ndamages); Winn, 839  F.2d at 837  (retrial on liability  only\n              \n\nwhere damages properly determined); see  generally 11 Charles\n                                                  \n\nA.

If\n\nthe comparative negligence figures are changed as a result of\n\nthe  new  trial,  the  total  damage  award can  be  adjusted\n\naccordingly. \n\n          Because we vacate  and remand  for a  new trial  on\n\nboth the strict  liability and negligence claims, as  well as\n\ncomparative negligence,  it is unnecessary for  us to address\n\nHonda's remaining arguments regarding  these matters.

Evidence of Honda's Profits from ATV Sales\n                                              \n\n          Plaintiff's  counsel  was  permitted, over  Honda's\n\nobjection, to read the  following interrogatory and answer to\n\nthe jury  in connection with  his negligent  failure to  warn\n\nclaim:\n\n          Q.     Please   state  the   total  gross\n          revenues, profits and net income from the\n          sale of the  all-terrain vehicles for the\n          years 1970 through 1989 in each and every\n          country  where ATVs  are or  were offered\n          for sale  to the public.   Please respond\n          separately for each listed  entity, Honda\n          Motor Company, Inc., American Honda Motor\n          Company,   Inc.,   Honda   R&amp;D   Company,\n          Limited.\n\n          A.

Although American Honda\n          does not  keep records  of net profit  by\n          ATV  product  line it  allocated expenses\n          pursuant    to   reasonable    accounting\n          principles to obtain a sum  comparable to\n          pre-tax  net  profits in  the approximate\n          sum of $73,371,000.\n\nHonda  argues that the evidence of its profits from ATV sales\n\nwas  irrelevant and  therefore  inadmissible.   Assuming  the\n\nevidence was relevant, Honda  argues that its probative value\n\nwas substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n\n          \"Evidence  is relevant  if it  has any  tendency to\n\nmake  the   existence  of  any  fact   consequential  to  the\n\ndetermination  of the action more  or less probable.\"  United\n                                                             \n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nStates  v.

After plaintiff's  counsel read\n        \n\nthe interrogatory  and answer,  the trial judge  explained to\n\nthe jury that\n\n          [t]he  evidence  [of Honda's  profits] is\n          being presented  only  to assist  you  in\n          determining  what Honda may have known or\n          not  known  about the  particular vehicle\n          that's  the  subject of  this  case.   In\n          other   words,  it's  to  assist  you  in\n          understanding or  reaching conclusions as\n          to what Honda may  have known or believed\n          about the ATC 200  or why it acted  as it\n          did and  so forth. .  . .   [Y]ou're  not\n          being  asked to  be Robin Hoods  here and\n          take money from Honda simply because they\n          may have  made money on the  sale of this\n          vehicle.    The  only  purpose   of  this\n          evidence is, as I  said, to assist you in\n          reaching  whatever conclusions  you think\n          are warranted about  whether the  vehicle\n          as used had means to be dangerous or what\n          Honda may have known about the vehicle or\n          what it  might  have believed  about  the\n          safety of the vehicle.\n\nNear  the end  of  the trial  the  court commented  that  the\n\nrecords  of Honda's  ATV profits  \"seemed to be  probative of\n\nthe,  shall  we say,  the credibility  of the  explanation by\n\nHonda; and  the Court  gave a limit[ing]  instruction to  the\n\njury at that time.\"\n\n          The   first  question  is  whether  the  challenged\n\nevidence was  relevant  to plaintiff's  negligent failure  to\n\nwarn claim.  In Rhode Island,  a defendant has a duty to warn\n\nif he knew or should have known about the product's dangerous\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\npropensities which caused  plaintiff's injuries.

This is because the\n   \n\nnegligence  inquiry measures  behavior  against an  objective\n\nstandard, without reference to the defendant's state of mind.\n\nSee Sparks v.

Here,  however,\n        \n\nwhether or  not Honda  had a duty  to warn  plaintiff of  the\n\nATV's  dangerous  propensities depended  upon  its subjective\n\nknowledge of  those dangers.   Consequently, the  evidence of\n\nHonda's  profits from ATV sales was, as we demonstrate in the\n\nensuing  paragraph, relevant to plaintiff's negligent failure\n\nto warn claim.\n\n          With  respect  to  his negligence  claim  plaintiff\n\nalleged that, prior to his accident, Honda knew that its ATVs\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nwould \"plow\" (i.e., continue in a straight line even when the\n                  \n\nhandlebars are turned) under normal riding  conditions unless\n\nthe rider  shifted his  or her  weight in  a counterintuitive\n\nmanner.    Honda denied  that it  had  any knowledge  of this\n\ndanger.   Honda's profits  from ATV  sales was  introduced as\n\nevidence that  Honda's failure  to provide  adequate warnings\n\nabout  plowing   resulted  from  greed,  not   from  lack  of\n\nknowledge.    Therefore,  proof  of profits  as  evidence  of\n\nmotive, while not material  to any element of the  failure to\n\nwarn claim, was probative  of an issue relevant to  the case:\n\nthe credibility of Honda's explanation for its inaction.\n\n          Generally  speaking,  \"[a]ll  relevant evidence  is\n\nadmissible.\"  Fed. R.  Evid. 402.   Under Rule  403, however,\n\nrelevant evidence may  be excluded if the  probative value of\n\nthe evidence  \"is substantially  outweighed by the  danger of\n\nunfair prejudice\" to  the party against  whom it is  offered.\n\nFed.

Raymond,  938 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1518, 1523-24  (1st Cir.  1991); St. Michael's  Credit Union,\n                                                            \n\n880  F.2d at 601.   Although the evidence  of Honda's profits\n\nfrom  ATV sales was of  some probative value,  we believe the\n\ndanger that  this evidence would unfairly  prejudice the jury\n\nwas overwhelming.\n\n          The evidence was, at best, marginally  relevant and\n\nof  scant  probative value  to  plaintiff's  failure to  warn\n\nclaim.   On the other hand,  the risk that the  jury would be\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nprejudiced by this reference to the enormous profitability of\n\nHonda's  ATVs  was  almost  inescapable.     The  potentially\n\nprejudicial nature of this \"motive\" evidence in the liability\n\nphase of  the trial was one of  the factors that prompted the\n\ndistrict  court   to  try  the  issue   of  punitive  damages\n\nseparately.  While the court did give a  limiting instruction\n\nto the  jury warning  against equalizing wealth  between rich\n\nand poor, it  did not  alert the jury  to the impropriety  of\n\npunishing Honda  for an unsavory  motive.  The  inadequacy of\n\nthe limiting  instruction coupled with  the highly attenuated\n\nrelevance  of  the evidence  leads  us  to  believe that  the\n\ndistrict court miscalibrated its Rule 403 scales.\n\n          Honda argues  that the  admission of  this evidence\n\nwas reversible error,  as it skewed the  jury's allocation of\n\nfault, and infected its liability determinations.  Because we\n\nhave already ordered a new trial on both of these matters, we\n\nneed  not  decide  whether  the  district  court's  error  in\n\nadmitting  the evidence  of  Honda's profits  from ATV  sales\n\nwarrants  a  new  trial.   Nevertheless,  we  hold that  this\n\nmaterial should not be admitted on retrial.  In addition, any\n\nreferences  to that  information,  such as  the  one made  by\n\nplaintiff at closing argument, should not be allowed.4\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  following   remarks   were  made,   albeit   without\nobjection, during plaintiff's summation:\n\n               Well, I told you at the beginning of\n          this case that the very disturbing, . . .\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\n          On appeal Honda  has raised two arguments  relating\n\nto the damages award that should be addressed at this time.\n\nD.  Choice-of-Law\n                 \n\n          Honda  argues that the district court's decision to\n\napply Rhode Island, rather than Colorado law, to the issue of\n\ncompensatory damages was erroneous.5  We disagree.\n\n                    \n\n          one  of the  most  disturbing aspects  of\n          this  case is  something that  I believed\n          throughout my  work on  this case. .  . .\n          Honda's actions or more  truthfully their\n          inactions in this case were  motivated by\n          greed.  They were motivated by greed.\n\n               Do you remember when I  stood before\n          you on the  last day of  Plaintiff's case\n          and  I  read  to you  that  interrogatory\n          answer  concerning  the  amount of  money\n          that Honda made in a six-year period from\n          1979 to 1985 from  ATVs, and I stood here\n          and I read it, and you may have been able\n          to  notice,  I almost  became overwhelmed\n          with  emotion  when  I was  reading  that\n          because  it  sunk into  me at  that point\n          what really was  the reason Honda  didn't\n          do  anything to  warn  people about  this\n          machine.    It  was  money.    It  was  a\n          business decision.  They were making just\n          between  1979  and   1985  $1.7   billion\n          selling these machines in this country. .\n          .  .      I  submit to  you  that  Arthur\n          LaPlante's   accident   would  not   have\n          happened  if  this  company  had  thought\n          about  people before  money.    Had  they\n          thought about people before money.\n\n5.  The  difference between  the two  is substantial.   While\nneither  state  limits a  plaintiff's recovery  of \"economic\"\ndamages,    or   damages   for    physical   impairment   and\ndisfigurement, Colorado  sets a  $250,000 cap on  damages for\n\"noneconomic  loss or  injury,\" (i.e.,  pain and  suffering),\n                                     \nColo.  Rev. Stat.   13-21-102.5  (1987 &amp; 1993  Supp.).  Rhode\nIsland has no such limit.\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\n          At  the  outset, we  reject  plaintiff's contention\n\nthat  Honda failed to preserve the choice-of-law issue.  This\n\nmatter  was timely  and  squarely presented  to the  district\n\ncourt prior  to trial, and was decided  in plaintiff's favor.\n\nHonda  was under no obligation  to renew its  motion later in\n\nthe  proceedings.  See Union  Mut. Life Ins.  Co. v. Chrysler\n                                                             \n\nCorp.,  793 F.2d  1,  17 (1st  Cir.  1986) (no  waiver  where\n     \n\nchoice-of-law matter was \"brought with  sufficient clarity to\n\nthe [district] court's attention\"); see also Jaurequi v.

The first set of factors\n                 \n\nto be  taken into account are (1)  the place where the injury\n\noccurred; (2) the place where  the conduct causing the injury\n\noccurred; (3)  the place that  the parties  call home  (e.g.,\n                                                            \n\ntheir domicile,  residence, place of incorporation,  or place\n\nof  business); and (4)  the place where  the relationship, if\n\nany, between the parties is centered.  See Brown v.

In the present case, Honda  wants Colorado\n\nand  not  Rhode  Island  law  to  apply  to  the  measure  of\n\ncompensatory damages  available to plaintiff, but  not to the\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nsubstantive  rules of liability governing plaintiff's claims.\n\nThere  is no  reason that  this cannot  be  done.   Under the\n\ndoctrine of depecage, different  substantive issues in a tort\n\ncase may be resolved under the laws of different states where\n\nthe choices  influencing decisions differ.   See Pateman, 958\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 465; Ashland Oil, Inc. v.

Rhode  Island  ascribes to  the  principles  of\n\ndepecage in tort cases.  Pateman Resources, 958 F.2d at 465.\n                                          \n\n          Regarding the number of contacts, we can discern no\n\nmaterial  difference  between   Rhode  Island  and  Colorado.\n\nAlthough  the  injury  occurred  in  Colorado,  none  of  the\n\ndefendants are domiciliaries of Colorado.6  Furthermore,  the\n\ntortious  conduct   allegedly  giving  rise   to  plaintiff's\n\ninjuries  occurred  in  Japan,  where  the  subject  ATV  was\n\ndesigned and its warnings devised.  See Price v. Litton Sys.,\n                                                             \n\nInc.,  784 F.2d 600, 604 (5th Cir. 1986) (conduct occurred at\n    \n\nplace of design in design defect case).  Finally, there being\n\n                    \n\n6.  American  Honda  is  a  California  corporation with  its\nprincipal place of business  in that state.  Honda  Motor Co.\nand Honda  R&amp;D Co.  are both Japanese  corporations and  have\ntheir principal place of business in that country.\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\nno \"relationship\"  between the parties in  the ordinary sense\n\nof  the word, this factor is unhelpful in making a choice-of-\n\nlaw determination.   See Allison  v. ITE Imperial  Corp., 928\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 137,  142 &amp;  n.5  (5th Cir.  1991) (this  factor is  not\n\nhelpful  in  products  liability  cases where  there  was  no\n\npreexisting  relationship  between  the  parties);  see  also\n                                                             \n\nRestatement (Second)  of Conflict  of Laws    145 (factor  in\n\nchoice-of-law analysis is  place where the relationship,  \"if\n\nany\", of  the parties is centered).   Consequently, Colorado,\n\nas  the place of injury,  has a single  material contact with\n\nthe present action.\n\n          Rhode  Island  too  has   one  contact  with   this\n\nlitigation because,  at the  time of the  accident, plaintiff\n\nwas a domiciliary of Rhode  Island.  See Restatement (Second)\n                                        \n\nof Conflict of Laws   17 (\"A person does not  usually acquire\n\na domicil of choice by his presence in a place under physical\n\nor  legal compulsion.\");  Stifel v.

And,\n   \n\npredictably,   plaintiff  returned   home  to   Rhode  Island\n\nimmediately after the accident.7\n\n                    \n\n7.  Honda argues that plaintiff's post-accident return to his\nhome state  should not  factor into our  equation because  \"a\nlitigant's  decision to  move to  the forum  state  after the\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\n          That Rhode Island  was plaintiff's domicile at  the\n\ntime of the accident is conceded by the parties, and is amply\n\nsupported  by  the  record  -- throughout  his  stay  in  the\n\nmilitary  plaintiff  continued to  pay  income  tax in  Rhode\n\nIsland,  and, on  his  1987  reenlistment  papers,  plaintiff\n\nlisted Rhode Island as his home. That plaintiff was stationed\n\nat an army base in Colorado at the time of the accident was a\n\nmatter of pure chance.  In fact, in his six years of service,\n\nplaintiff  had been stationed  in Hawaii,  Maryland, Kentucky\n\nand Korea prior to arriving in Colorado.\n\n          Because  the  number of  contacts  claimed by  each\n\nstate  is  equivalent,  we  examine  the  additional  factors\n\nenumerated  by  the  Rhode   Island  courts,  beginning  with\n\n\"predictability of  results.\"  This factor  militates against\n\nthe  application of  Colorado  law.   Honda,  a large  multi-\n\nnational  corporation,  cannot  argue  convincingly  that  it\n\nexpected  Colorado  law to  apply to  a  case arising  from a\n\nproduct manufactured  in Japan  and involving a  Rhode Island\n\ncitizen  simply because  the product  was originally  sold in\n\nColorado.  It  would be  difficult for Honda  to persuade  us\n\n                    \n\ncause of action accrued should  be accorded minimal weight in\nthe  choice-of-law analysis.\"   Appellants' Brief at  44.  As\nthe  cases cited  by  Honda illustrate,  see, e.g.,  Phillips\n                                                             \nPetroleum Co. v.

Where, as is\nthe  case  here, there  is not  the  slightest hint  of forum\nshopping, plaintiff's  return to  Rhode Island should  not be\nignored.\n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\nthat it molded its behavior in reliance on Colorado's damages\n\nlaw, particularly where  that law was not enacted  until four\n\nyears after the  subject ATV  was thrust into  the stream  of\n\ncommerce.   See Roy v. Star Chopper  Co., 584 F.2d 1124, 1129\n                                        \n\n(1st  Cir. 1978), cert. denied,  440 U.S. 916  (1979).  Honda\n                              \n\ncertainly did  not purchase liability insurance  based on its\n\npotential  exposure under  a nonexistent  Colorado law.   See\n                                                             \n\nTurcotte  v. Ford Motor Co., 494 F.2d  173, 178 n.6 (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1974).  Honda can neither claim nor rely on a vested right to\n\nlimited exposure for non-economic damages under Colorado law.\n\nJaurequi, 986  F.2d at 186.   Consequently, Honda's justified\n        \n\nexpectations would not  be upset by the  application of Rhode\n\nIsland law.\n\n          We turn to the next  factor:  maintenance of inter-\n\nstate order.   \"`Interstate order is  served when application\n\nof  one state's  law offends  no law  or policy of  the other\n\nstate.'\"  Roy, 584  F.2d at 1129 (quoting Turcotte,  494 F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat  178).   To perform  this analysis,  we must  identify the\n\npurposes or policies which underlie each state's rule of law,\n\nand the  degree to  which the purposes  underlying each  rule\n\nwould be  furthered by  the rule's application.   Inevitably,\n\nthis analysis  subsumes the  fourth factor delineated  by the\n\nRhode  Island   courts:     \"advancement   of   the   forum's\n\ngovernmental interests.\"\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\n          Colorado  has  little   governmental  interest   in\n\nlimiting  the  amount  of  damages  for  pain  and  suffering\n\navailable  to  plaintiff  in  the present  litigation.    The\n\nColorado statute limiting the amount of damages for pain  and\n\nsuffering in  civil actions, Colo. Rev.  Stat.   13-21-102.5,\n\nreflects an economic policy  consideration.  According to the\n\nColorado Supreme  Court, \"[i]t is clear  from the legislative\n\nhistory of section 13-21-102.5 . . . that the primary goal of\n\nthe  legislature  was  to  increase  the   affordability  and\n\navailability  of  insurance by  making  the  risk of  insured\n\nentities more predictable.\"  General Elec. Co. v. Niemet, 866\n                                                        \n\nP.2d 1361, 1364 (Colo.  1994).  Thus, the goal  of Colorado's\n\nlegislature was:\n\n          to  improve  the predictability  of risks\n          faced  by insurance  companies.    If  an\n          insurance company can predict  risks with\n          reasonable  accuracy,  then  it can  also\n          predict  its losses  and  profits.    The\n          concern  of an  insurance company  is the\n          risk   associated   with  insuring   each\n          individual insured, not  with denying  an\n          injured person  damages that may  be paid\n          by another insurance company or person.  \n\nId. at 1365.  The crucial  question, then, is whether, on the\n   \n\nfacts  of this  particular  case, Colorado's  policy will  be\n\nadvanced by the application of its damages cap.\n\n          We can  see no reason why  the Colorado legislature\n\nwould be concerned with  the affordability of insurance  to a\n\nmultinational  Japanese  corporation   or  its   wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary, a California corporation.   Honda sells its cars,\n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\nmotorcycles and recreational  vehicles in  all fifty  states,\n\nand Colorado's  damages law plays, at  best, an insignificant\n\nrole in setting Honda's  insurance rates.  In fact,  there is\n\nno  evidence  in  the  record  that  Honda  has  ceased doing\n\nbusiness in any state because of  a failure by that state  to\n\nlimit  the amount  of damages  a plaintiff  may recover  in a\n\ncivil action.\n\n          Rhode  Island  courts,  on  the  other  hand,  have\n\nrepeatedly   stressed  that  a   plaintiff  should  be  fully\n\ncompensated  for his  personal  injuries, including  pain and\n\nsuffering.   See, e.g.,  Hayhurst v. LaFlamme,  441 A.2d 544,\n                                             \n\n548-49 (R.I.  1982); Kelaghan v.  Roberts, 433 A.2d  226, 230\n                                         \n\n(R.I. 1981).   Domiciliary states have  a strong interest  in\n\nthe welfare  of their  plaintiffs, and  in seeing  that their\n\nplaintiffs  are adequately  compensated  for their  injuries.\n\nSee In re Air Crash Disaster Near Chicago, 644 F.2d 594, 612-\n                                         \n\n13 (7th Cir.), cert.  denied, 454 U.S. 878 (1981);  Burgio v.\n                                                          \n\nMcDonnell  Douglas, Inc.,  747  F.

This  interest is\n\nbest served  by applying the law of  the plaintiff's domicile\n\nto  the measure  of compensatory  damages.   In re  Air Crash\n                                                             \n\nDisaster,  644 F.2d  at  613.

As to  the former, we\n\ncannot  see how  the  judicial task  would  be more  or  less\n\nsimplified  by  application of  one  rule as  opposed  to the\n\nother.  As  for the  latter, the Rhode  Island Supreme  Court\n\nwould  undoubtedly  favor   a  compensatory  damage  standard\n\nwithout limits.  We  are confident that a Rhode  Island court\n\nfaced  with this choice-of-  law dilemma would  apply its own\n\nlaw.   The  district  court, it  follows,  acted properly  in\n\napplying Rhode Island law.\n\nE.  Prejudgment Interest\n                        \n\n          Honda argues  that prejudgment interest  should not\n\nbe assessed on future damages, or on damages awarded for pain\n\nand suffering.  A brief foray into Rhode Island law evidences\n\nthe futility of Honda's arguments.8\n\n          In arguing  that the trial court  erred in applying\n\nRhode   Island's  prejudgment  interest   statute  to  future\n\ndamages,   Honda   maintains   that  \"interest\"   is   simply\n\n                    \n\n8.  In light of our  determination that a Rhode Island  court\nwould apply its own law to the issue of compensatory damages,\nso too would it  apply its own prejudgment  interest statute.\nSee  Johnson v.

Accordingly,  the judgment\n             \n\nfor Honda on plaintiff's  claim for punitive damages  must be\n\naffirmed.\n\n                             III.\n\n                             -36-\n                              36\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          The judgment of liability  is vacated, and the case\n\nis remanded  for a  new trial  on all  liability issues.   On\n\nretrial  the district  court should  exclude the  evidence of\n\nHonda's profits  from ATV  sales, and prohibit  references to\n\nthat information similar to the one made in  closing argument\n\nat the original trial.\n\n          We uphold the  district court's  decision to  apply\n\nRhode  Island law  as to  compensatory damages,  and conclude\n\nthat,  should  plaintiff prevail  on  retrial,  the award  of\n\ndamages shall  stand,  and  prejudgment  interest  should  be\n\nassessed  on the entire damage award.  The judgment for Honda\n\non plaintiff's claim for  punitive damages claim is affirmed.\n\nNo costs to either party.\n\n          So ordered.\n                    \n\n                             -37-\n                              37\n",

(collectively \"Honda\").   A jury found Honda\n\nliable  and  awarded  plaintiff  $9,652,000  in  compensatory\n\ndamages.   This amount  was reduced to  $8,204,200 to account\n\nfor  plaintiff's  comparative  negligence.    In  a  separate\n\nproceeding, the  district court granted judgment  as a matter\n\nof law for  Honda on plaintiff's claim for  punitive damages.\n\nHonda appeals from the judgment of liability and compensatory\n\ndamages.

As  for  plaintiff's  cross-appeal,  the\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          On Saturday,  March 11, 1989, the  course of Arthur\n\nLaPlante's  life was  dramatically and  irreversibly altered.\n\nOn  that  morning  plaintiff,  a  twenty-four  year-old  army\n\nmechanic  stationed  at  Fort  Carson,  Colorado,  and  three\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nfriends,  Kelly  Kallhoff,  Randy  Leib,   and  Mike  Mohawk,\n\nventured to  nearby Pikes  Peak in order  to ride  Kallhoff's\n\nthree-wheel ATV, a  1982 Honda ATC200.  This ATV  is a three-\n\nwheeled  motorized vehicle  intended for  off-road use.   The\n\nvehicle has  handlebar steering and large low-pressure tires,\n\ntwo in the rear, and one in front.\n\n          Plaintiff, who had never  before ridden an ATV, was\n\nthe third to ride after Kallhoff and Leib.  After climbing to\n\nthe top of a knoll, plaintiff  began to descend at a speed of\n\n5-10 m.p.h.  When  plaintiff was unable to negotiate  a left-\n\nhand turn onto a twelve  foot wide dirt road, he fell  over a\n\nsteep embankment  and broke his neck,  resulting in permanent\n\nparalysis from the neck down.\n\n          On January 11, 1991,  plaintiff, who lived in Rhode\n\nIsland  before enlisting  in  the Army  in 1983  and returned\n\nthere after the accident,  commenced this diversity action in\n\nthe  United States District  Court for the  District of Rhode\n\nIsland.   The complaint delineated six causes of action:  (1)\n\nbreach  of  warranty;  (2) false  advertising;  (3) negligent\n\nfailure to advise  how to operate the vehicle;  (4) negligent\n\nfailure to warn; (5) strict  liability design defect; and (6)\n\nwillful,   wanton  and   reckless  conduct   (i.e.,  punitive\n                                                  \n\ndamages).   The  trial was  bifurcated so  that the  issue of\n\npunitive damages could be tried after the issues of liability\n\nand  compensatory  damages.    The  parties  agree  that  the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nsubstantive law of Rhode  Island governs the liability issues\n\nin this action.  \n\n          A   twenty-three  day   trial   on  liability   and\n\ncompensatory damages began  in July  1993.  At  the close  of\n\nplaintiff's case Honda moved for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nOnly  the claims  for  negligent failure  to warn  and strict\n\nliability design defect survived  the motion.  Ultimately the\n\njury found  Honda  liable on  these two  claims, and  awarded\n\nplaintiff $3,652,000 for medical expenses and lost wages, and\n\n$6,000,000 for physical injuries and pain and suffering.  The\n\njury also found  that plaintiff was  comparatively negligent,\n\nand reduced his award by fifteen percent.  The district court\n\ndenied Honda's motions for postjudgment relief.\n\n          The punitive damages phase of this action commenced\n\non September  16, 1993.   On  the same day,  at the  close of\n\nplaintiff's  evidence, the  district  court  granted  Honda's\n\nmotion  for judgment as a matter of law.  These cross-appeals\n\nensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  Rhode Island's Subsequent Alteration Statute\n                                                \n\n          Honda  argues that  the  district  court  committed\n\nreversible  error   by  not  instructing  the   jury  on  the\n\naffirmative  defense provided  by Rhode  Island's \"subsequent\n\nalteration\" statute, R.I. Gen. Laws   9-1-32 (1985).\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Rhode Island law  provides that \"[n]o  manufacturer\n\nor  seller of a product shall be liable for product liability\n\ndamages where  a substantial cause  of the injury,  death, or\n                                                 \n\ndamage was  a subsequent  alteration or modification.\"   R.I.\n\nGen. Laws   9-1-32(b) (emphasis  added).  The statute defines\n\n\"subsequent alteration or modification\" as\n\n          an  alteration  or   modification  of   a\n          product    made    subsequent   to    the\n          manufacture or sale  by the  manufacturer\n          or  seller  which  altered, modified,  or\n          changed   the  purpose,   use,  function,\n          design, or  manner of use of  the product\n          from that originally designed,  tested or\n          intended  by  the  manufacturer,  or  the\n          purpose, use, function, design, or manner\n          of  use  or intended  use for  which such\n          product  was originally  designed, tested\n          or manufactured.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>     9-1-32(a)(2).    Honda </span><pre class=\"inline\"> contends  that  it  presented\n   \n\nevidence  that  the ATV  ridden by  plaintiff was  altered or\n\nmodified  after its  original sale,  and therefore  the trial\n\ncourt's  failure to instruct the jury in accordance with   9-\n\n1-32  was reversible error.  In support of its position Honda\n\npoints to evidence  that, at  the time of  the accident,  the\n\nATV's  front brakes  were  inoperable, its  rear brakes  were\n\nfaulty, its right rear tire was overinflated, its front forks\n\nwere bent, and it pulled to the right.\n\n          Plaintiff's  response  is   fourfold.    First,  he\n\nmaintains   that  \"lax   maintenance\"  cannot   constitute  a\n\n\"subsequent  alteration or  modification\" under  the statute.\n\nRather,  plaintiff  insists that     9-1-32  was intended  to\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n\"provide a  defense when  someone has deliberately  altered a\n\nmachine. .  . .\"   Next,  he argues that  the statute  merely\n\ncodified  comment  g  of  Section  402A  of  the  Restatement\n\n(Second) of  Torts.  Third, plaintiff contends  that the jury\n\ncharge adequately  apprised the  jurors of Rhode  Island law.\n\nFinally, he argues that any error was harmless  because Honda\n\nfailed to present sufficient evidence that any of the alleged\n\nsubsequent alterations was a substantial cause of plaintiff's\n\ninjuries.\n\n          With respect to the  scope of the statute,  we have\n\nbeen unable  to find  any support for  plaintiff's contention\n\nthat  the  scope  of      9-1-32  is  limited  to  deliberate\n\nalterations, such  as the removal of safety  guards, and does\n\nnot reach \"alterations\" or \"modifications\" that have resulted\n\nfrom inadequate maintenance.  It is well settled  under Rhode\n\nIsland  law  that   \"[i]n  the  event   that  a  statute   is\n\nunambiguous, it  is  necessary for  this court  to apply  its\n\nterms  literally.\"  Keenan v.

Here,  plaintiff's proposed  limitation directly\n\ncontradicts  the  unambiguous  and  broad  language   of  the\n\nstatute.  No  exception has  been drawn by  the Rhode  Island\n\nlegislature   for   alterations  resulting   from  inadequate\n\nmaintenance as opposed to deliberate changes, and we can find\n\nno  principled reason for reading such  an exception into the\n\nstatute.\n\n          Several  states  have  enacted comparable  statutes\n\nthat  specifically   include  \"failure  to   observe  routine\n\nmaintenance\" within  the meaning of  subsequent alteration or\n\nmodification.

We have failed, however, to\n\nuncover a single statute that excludes inadequate maintenance\n\nfrom the  category of  subsequent alteration  or modification\n\nfor purposes of  this defense.   Finally, given the  apparent\n\npurpose  of    9-1-32,  i.e., to  protect manufacturers  from\n                            \n\nunanticipated risks  created by alterations  or modifications\n\noccurring after a product leaves their control, we can see no\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nreason  why  the Rhode  Island  legislature  would provide  a\n\ndefendant  with  a  complete   defense  where  an  ATV  owner\n\ndisconnected his front brakes, but not where the front brakes\n\nwere  inoperative  due  to  the owner's  failure  to  perform\n\nroutine maintenance.\n\n          Next,  plaintiff   argues  that      9-1-32  merely\n\ncodifies  the essence  of comment  g to  Section 402A  of the\n\nRestatement (Second) of  Torts which  provides, in  pertinent\n\npart, that \"[t]he seller  is not liable when he  delivers the\n\nproduct in  a safe  condition, and subsequent  mishandling or\n\nother causes make  it harmful  by the time  it is  consumed.\"\n\nPlaintiff points to no  language in   9-1-32 to  support this\n\nargument.  Rather, plaintiff  relies solely upon the presence\n\nof   9-1-32  in two  string citations,   i.e., Model  Uniform\n                                             \n\nProduct Liability Act   112(D), analysis (1979) (citing    9-\n\n1-32 among statutes that  have \"enacted the essence of  . . .\n\ncomment [g]  into law\"); Robinson v.

Neither authority explains the inclusion\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nof   9-1-32 in  its respective string citation, nor  does the\n\ntext of the statute bear even a modest resemblance to comment\n\ng of  the Restatement.

That   does  not\n          necessarily  mean  that the  product must\n          have  been in exactly  the same condition\n          at  the time  of the  injury that  it was\n          when  it  left  the Defendant's  control.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          What it does mean is  that the particular\n          defect for  which the Plaintiff  seeks to\n          hold  the manufacturer  responsible, must\n          have existed at the time the product left\n          the Defendant's control.\n\nTrial Transcript of August 19, 1993 at 12-13.

It may be considered a proximate\n          cause if  it operates together  with some\n          other  contemporaneous  cause to  produce\n          the injury.   In such  cases, both causes\n          may be  considered proximate causes.   If\n          the two of  them act together  to produce\n          the  injury, you could have two proximate\n          causes.\n               [A]  defect  must  be,  at  least, a\n          substantial   contributing   factor    in\n          producing the  injury in order  for it to\n          be  considered a proximate  cause of that\n          injury.

At  trial Honda  adduced ample\n\nevidence  that  the  ATV  ridden  by  plaintiff was  in  poor\n\ncondition  on the day of  the accident.   Most significant is\n\nthe undisputed fact that the ATV's front brakes did not work.\n\nIn addition, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have\n\nfound that,  at the time  of the accident,  the ATV  had bent\n\nfront  forks, severely  maladjusted  rear  brakes,  unequally\n\ninflated rear tires, and pulled to the right.2\n\n          A rational jury,  presented with Honda's subsequent\n\nalteration defense, could have  found that any or all  of the\n\nalleged alterations or  modifications \"substantially  caused\"\n\nplaintiff's    injuries.       Consequently,    the   court's\n\ninstructional  error could  have changed  the outcome  of the\n\ntrial.   Honda  was  not  only  entitled  to  have  the  jury\n\n                    \n\n2.  To  underscore the  poor condition  of the  ATV, Sergeant\nJames Shirley, its owner prior to Kallhoff, testified that he\npaid only  $25 for the  ATV.

In addition, Shirley testified\nthat  he did not make any significant repairs to the vehicle,\nand that  the vehicle's condition appeared  unchanged when he\nsaw it one week prior to the accident. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522150\"><a href=\"/opinion/522150/paul-h-allen-v-chance-manufacturing-co-inc/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 53, </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">56.\n                                          \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\ninstructed  on  this  defense, but  it  is  evident that  the\n\ncourt's failure to give the instruction was reversible error.\n\n          Plaintiff  raises  one  additional   argument  that\n\nwarrants brief  discussion.   He maintains that  the district\n\ncourt's failure to give  a subsequent alteration charge, even\n\nif reversible error, has no bearing on the  negligent failure\n\nto warn claim.  This argument fails for two reasons.   First,\n\n  9-1-32 expressly covers  failure to warn claims as  well as\n\ndesign  defect  claims.     R.I.  Gen.  Laws     9-1-32(a)(1)\n\n(\"product  liability damages\"  includes damages  for personal\n\ninjuries  sustained  by reason  of  an  alleged  defect in  a\n\nproduct  or an  alleged failure  to warn  against a  danger).\n\nSecond,  the  case cited  by  plaintiff as  support  for this\n\nproposition, Witthauer v. Burkhart Roentgen, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\n                                                 \n\n<span class=\"page\">439</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(N.D.  1991), is  clearly distinguishable.

Here,\n\nplaintiff's claim is that Honda failed to warn him of dangers\n\ncaused  by  the  ATV's  original  design  defect,  not  by  a\n\nforeseeable   modification   or  alteration.     Accordingly,\n\nWitthauer is  inapposite.   We  have  considered  plaintiff's\n         \n\nother  arguments anent   9-1-32  and find them  to be without\n\nmerit.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nB.

Here,  however,\n        \n\nwhether or  not Honda  had a duty  to warn  plaintiff of  the\n\nATV's  dangerous  propensities depended  upon  its subjective\n\nknowledge of  those dangers.   Consequently, the  evidence of\n\nHonda's  profits from ATV sales was, as we demonstrate in the\n\nensuing  paragraph, relevant to plaintiff's negligent failure\n\nto warn claim.\n\n          With  respect  to  his negligence  claim  plaintiff\n\nalleged that, prior to his accident, Honda knew that its ATVs\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nwould \"plow\" (i.e., continue in a straight line even when the\n                  \n\nhandlebars are turned) under normal riding  conditions unless\n\nthe rider  shifted his  or her  weight in  a counterintuitive\n\nmanner.    Honda denied  that it  had  any knowledge  of this\n\ndanger.   Honda's profits  from ATV  sales was  introduced as\n\nevidence that  Honda's failure  to provide  adequate warnings\n\nabout  plowing   resulted  from  greed,  not   from  lack  of\n\nknowledge.    Therefore,  proof  of profits  as  evidence  of\n\nmotive, while not material  to any element of the  failure to\n\nwarn claim, was probative  of an issue relevant to  the case:\n\nthe credibility of Honda's explanation for its inaction.\n\n          Generally  speaking,  \"[a]ll  relevant evidence  is\n\nadmissible.\"  Fed.

Although the evidence  of Honda's profits\n\nfrom  ATV sales was of  some probative value,  we believe the\n\ndanger that  this evidence would unfairly  prejudice the jury\n\nwas overwhelming.\n\n          The evidence was, at best, marginally  relevant and\n\nof  scant  probative value  to  plaintiff's  failure to  warn\n\nclaim.   On the other hand,  the risk that the  jury would be\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nprejudiced by this reference to the enormous profitability of\n\nHonda's  ATVs  was  almost  inescapable.     The  potentially\n\nprejudicial nature of this \"motive\" evidence in the liability\n\nphase of  the trial was one of  the factors that prompted the\n\ndistrict  court   to  try  the  issue   of  punitive  damages\n\nseparately.  While the court did give a  limiting instruction\n\nto the  jury warning  against equalizing wealth  between rich\n\nand poor, it  did not  alert the jury  to the impropriety  of\n\npunishing Honda  for an unsavory  motive.  The  inadequacy of\n\nthe limiting  instruction coupled with  the highly attenuated\n\nrelevance  of  the evidence  leads  us  to  believe that  the\n\ndistrict court miscalibrated its Rule 403 scales.\n\n          Honda argues  that the  admission of  this evidence\n\nwas reversible error,  as it skewed the  jury's allocation of\n\nfault, and infected its liability determinations.  Because we\n\nhave already ordered a new trial on both of these matters, we\n\nneed  not  decide  whether  the  district  court's  error  in\n\nadmitting  the evidence  of  Honda's profits  from ATV  sales\n\nwarrants  a  new  trial.   Nevertheless,  we  hold that  this\n\nmaterial should not be admitted on retrial.  In addition, any\n\nreferences  to that  information,  such as  the  one made  by\n\nplaintiff at closing argument, should not be allowed.4\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  following   remarks   were  made,   albeit   without\nobjection, during plaintiff's summation:\n\n               Well, I told you at the beginning of\n          this case that the very disturbing, . . .\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\n          On appeal Honda  has raised two arguments  relating\n\nto the damages award that should be addressed at this time.\n\nD.  Choice-of-Law\n                 \n\n          Honda  argues that the district court's decision to\n\napply Rhode Island, rather than Colorado law, to the issue of\n\ncompensatory damages was erroneous.5  We disagree.\n\n                    \n\n          one  of the  most  disturbing aspects  of\n          this  case is  something that  I believed\n          throughout my  work on  this case. .  . .\n          Honda's actions or more  truthfully their\n          inactions in this case were  motivated by\n          greed.  They were motivated by greed.\n\n               Do you remember when I  stood before\n          you on the  last day of  Plaintiff's case\n          and  I  read  to you  that  interrogatory\n          answer  concerning  the  amount of  money\n          that Honda made in a six-year period from\n          1979 to 1985 from  ATVs, and I stood here\n          and I read it, and you may have been able\n          to  notice,  I almost  became overwhelmed\n          with  emotion  when  I was  reading  that\n          because  it  sunk into  me at  that point\n          what really was  the reason Honda  didn't\n          do  anything to  warn  people about  this\n          machine.    It  was  money.    It  was  a\n          business decision.  They were making just\n          between  1979  and   1985  $1.7   billion\n          selling these machines in this country. .\n          .  .      I  submit to  you  that  Arthur\n          LaPlante's   accident   would  not   have\n          happened  if  this  company  had  thought\n          about  people before  money.    Had  they\n          thought about people before money.\n\n5.  The  difference between  the two  is substantial.   While\nneither  state  limits a  plaintiff's recovery  of \"economic\"\ndamages,    or   damages   for    physical   impairment   and\ndisfigurement, Colorado  sets a  $250,000 cap on  damages for\n\"noneconomic  loss or  injury,\" (i.e.,  pain and  suffering),\n                                     \nColo.

Honda,  a large  multi-\n\nnational  corporation,  cannot  argue  convincingly  that  it\n\nexpected  Colorado  law to  apply to  a  case arising  from a\n\nproduct manufactured  in Japan  and involving a  Rhode Island\n\ncitizen  simply because  the product  was originally  sold in\n\nColorado.

To perform  this analysis,  we must  identify the\n\npurposes or policies which underlie each state's rule of law,\n\nand the  degree to  which the purposes  underlying each  rule\n\nwould be  furthered by  the rule's application.   Inevitably,\n\nthis analysis  subsumes the  fourth factor delineated  by the\n\nRhode  Island   courts:     \"advancement   of   the   forum's\n\ngovernmental interests.\"\n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\n          Colorado  has  little   governmental  interest   in\n\nlimiting  the  amount  of  damages  for  pain  and  suffering\n\navailable  to  plaintiff  in  the present  litigation.    The\n\nColorado statute limiting the amount of damages for pain  and\n\nsuffering in  civil actions, Colo. Rev.  Stat.   13-21-102.5,\n\nreflects an economic policy  consideration.  According to the\n\nColorado Supreme  Court, \"[i]t is clear  from the legislative\n\nhistory of section 13-21-102.5 . . . that the primary goal of\n\nthe  legislature  was  to  increase  the   affordability  and\n\navailability  of  insurance by  making  the  risk of  insured\n\nentities more predictable.\"  General Elec.

Thus, the goal  of Colorado's\n\nlegislature was:\n\n          to  improve  the predictability  of risks\n          faced  by insurance  companies.    If  an\n          insurance company can predict  risks with\n          reasonable  accuracy,  then  it can  also\n          predict  its losses  and  profits.    The\n          concern  of an  insurance company  is the\n          risk   associated   with  insuring   each\n          individual insured, not  with denying  an\n          injured person  damages that may  be paid\n          by another insurance company or person.  \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1365. </span><pre class=\"inline\"> The crucial  question, then, is whether, on the\n   \n\nfacts  of this  particular  case, Colorado's  policy will  be\n\nadvanced by the application of its damages cap.\n\n          We can  see no reason why  the Colorado legislature\n\nwould be concerned with  the affordability of insurance  to a\n\nmultinational  Japanese  corporation   or  its   wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary, a California corporation.   Honda sells its cars,\n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\nmotorcycles and recreational  vehicles in  all fifty  states,\n\nand Colorado's  damages law plays, at  best, an insignificant\n\nrole in setting Honda's  insurance rates.
