William  Rosa was sentenced on January\n                    \n\n6, 1992,  to a prison term  of 108 months  for drug offenses.\n\nAt sentencing, Rosa apparently received a two-level reduction\n\nin base  offense  level  for  acceptance  of  responsibility.\n\nEffective  November  1,  1992, the  United  States Sentencing\n\nCommission amended sentencing guideline    3E1.1 to permit an\n\nadditional  one-level reduction  in  base  offense level  for\n\npersons eligible for  the two-level reduction for  acceptance\n\nof  responsibility.    Rosa  sought to  reduce  his  sentence\n\npursuant  to   the  amended  guideline,   claiming  that  the\n\namendment  should  be applied  retroactively.   The  district\n\ncourt denied his request.   Because we have decided  that the\n\namendment  in question  is  not retroactive,  see DeSouza  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States, 995 F.2d  323, 324 (1st Cir. 1993),  we affirm\n             \n\nthe district court's denial of Rosa's request for  a sentence\n\nreduction under amended   3E1.1.1\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n1.  On July 9, 1993, this court issued an order directing the\ndistrict court  to take action  on Rosa's untimely  notice of\nappeal, which we treated as a request to extend the time  for\nfiling a  notice of appeal.   As we indicate  in our opinion,\nunder DeSouza  the judgment  of the  district  court must  be\n             \naffirmed on the merits.   Therefore, the jurisdictional issue\npresented by Rosa's  untimely notice  of appeal  need not  be\naddressed, see Amann v.
