Curran,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United  States Attorney,  and Lawrence D.  Gaynor, Assistant\r                                                                   \r\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.   We affirm  substantially for  the reasons\r                            \r\n\nstated  in  the magistrate-judge's  May  5,  1995 report  and\r\n\nrecommendation.  We add the following.\r\n\n     1.   We  reject petitioner's  argument that  no criminal\r\n\nhistory  point  should  have  been  added  for  the  offenses\r\n\ndescribed in  paragraph 34 of  the presentence report.   That\r\n\nparagraph  plainly  states   that  petitioner  received   the\r\n\n\"minimum sentence\" after pleading nolo  contendere to driving\r                                                              \r\n\nunder the influence.  Consequently, this offense was properly\r\n\ncounted  in petitioner's  criminal  history under  U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n4A1.1(c),  which directs a point  to be added  for each prior\r\n\nsentence (up to a total of four points).\r                    \r\n\n     2.   There is  no  merit to  petitioner's argument  that\r\n\ncounsel was  ineffective in failing  to argue for  a downward\r\n\ndeparture  under   U.S.S.G.     4A1.3  on   the  ground  that\r\n\npetitioner's  criminal  history category  significantly over-\r\n\nrepresented the seriousness of petitioner's  criminal history\r\n\nor  the  likelihood  that  petitioner  would  commit  further\r\n\ncrimes.    Section  4A1.3  gives  as   an  example  of  over-\r\n\nrepresentation   a  defendant  with   two  minor  misdemeanor\r\n\nconvictions  close  to  ten  years old  and  no  evidence  of\r\n\nintervening criminal behavior.   Petitioner's history is  not\r\n\nat  all comparable to the  example.  He  had five potentially\r\n\ncountable misdemeanor  convictions (only four  of which  were\r\n\ncounted in view  of   4A1.1(c)'s  four point limitation)  and\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nhis  criminal  history  spanned  many  years.    Petitioner's\r\n\ncriminal history was not over-represented and counsel did not\r\n\nprovide  ineffective  assistance  in  failing  to  advance  a\r\n\nmeritless argument.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
