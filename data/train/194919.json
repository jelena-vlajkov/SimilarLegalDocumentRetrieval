This appeal requires  us to\n                             \n\nresolve a conflict  between 1) a federal  statute that gives\n\nfederal  tax claims first  priority to a  bankrupt company's\n\nassets, 31  U.S.C.   3713,  and 2) a Puerto  Rico \"insurance\n\ncompany liquidation\" statute with  filing deadlines that can\n\nforce those federal claims to the end of the priority queue.\n\nP.R.  Laws Ann.,  tit. 26,     4019(2).   A special  federal\n\nstatute, governing  federal pre-emption  of state  insurance\n\nlaws, 15 U.S.C.    1012(b), would require us  to resolve the\n\nconflict in  favor of Puerto  Rico's law -- if  that special\n\nfederal statute applies.  But,  a recent Supreme Court case,\n\ninterpreting  that special law,  indicates that it  does not\n\napply.   Department  of Treasury  v. Fabe,  113 S.  Ct. 2202\n                                         \n\n(1993).   Hence, given  ordinary pre-emption principles, the\n\nfederal  statute governs.    We  reverse  a  district  court\n\ndetermination to the contrary.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          Puerto  Rico's  law   permits  the  Commonwealth's\n\nInsurance  Commissioner to act  as trustee for  an insolvent\n\ninsurance  company, to  liquidate its assets,  and to  set a\n\ndeadline  for  the filing  of  \"proofs  of claim\"  to  those\n\nassets.   P.R.  Laws Ann.,  tit.  26,     4002,  4019.    In\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nFebruary 1987, the Insurance Commissioner began proceedings,\n\nin a Commonwealth  court, to liquidate the  assets of Island\n\nProgram  Designer,  Inc.   (\"IPD\"),  a  health   maintenance\n\norganization.   The Insurance Commissioner set May 19, 1988,\n\nas the filing deadline for \"proofs of claim.\"\n\n          On  June 1, 1989, about  one year after the filing\n\ndeadline,  the federal Internal  Revenue Service  filed with\n\nthe Insurance  Commissioner a  formal \"proof\"  of its  claim\n\nagainst IPD for $53,000 (representing federal tax liens that\n\nthe IRS, between 1982 and 1985, had asserted, and perfected,\n\non IPD's assets).   In May 1991, the  IRS intervened in  the\n\nCommonwealth  court liquidation  proceedings.   26 U.S.C.   \n\n7424.   It asked for the $53,000, as  to which a federal law\n\ngave  it first  priority.  31  U.S.C.    3713.  It  also now\n\ntells us that,  without a first priority, it  will be unable\n\nto collect any of the money owed.\n\n          The Insurance  Commissioner opposed the  IRS claim\n\non the ground  that the IRS  had missed the  (May 19,  1988)\n\ndeadline for filing formal proofs  of claim.  He pointed out\n\nthat  Puerto Rico's  insurance  company liquidation  statute\n\nsays  that claims  for  which  proofs  are filed  after  the\n                                                       \n\ndeadline shall  not be  paid until  all timely-filed  claims\n                            \n\nhave been  \"paid in  full with interest.\"   P.R.  Laws Ann.,\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\ntit.  26,    4019(2).    And,  in  his view,  Puerto  Rico's\n\npriority system trumps the federal statute.\n\n          At this point, the IRS removed the case to federal\n\ncourt.    28  U.S.C.       1441(b),  1444.    The  Insurance\n\nCommissioner  asked the  district  court  to \"abstain\"  from\n\ndeciding the  legal issues,  and to remand  the case  to the\n\nCommonwealth  court.   The  district  court  then  wrote  an\n\nopinion  deciding the basic question and holding that Puerto\n\nRico's priority  law,  not  the  federal  priority  statute,\n\ngoverns.   It  also remanded  the  case to  the Commonwealth\n\ncourt.  The IRS now asks  us to review, and to reverse,  the\n\nremand order.\n\n                             II\n\n                    Appeal or Mandamus?\n                                       \n\n          We are  not completely  certain  why the  district\n\ncourt,  having decided  the major  legal issue in  the case,\n\ndecided  to  remand  it.    It  may  have  done  so   as  an\n\nadministrative matter,  to permit the Commonwealth  court to\n\nenter  a  final   judgment;  or  because  it   believed  the\n\ncontroversy  involved  other  legal  issues  that it  should\n\n\"abstain\"  from deciding; or simply because \"remand\" was the\n\nform   of  relief   that  the  Insurance   Commissioner  had\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nrequested.  Whatever the reason, the fact of remand raises a\n\ntechnical question  about the form  of review:  Can  the IRS\n\nsimply appeal  the remand order  or must  it seek a  writ of\n\nmandamus?  \n\n          The  problem arises out  of a Supreme  Court case,\n\nThermtron  Products,  Inc. v.  Hermansdorfer,  423  U.S. 336\n                                            \n\n(1976),  in  which  the  Court  considered  the scope  of  a\n\nstatute, 28 U.S.C.   1447(d), that appeared to bar appellate\n\nreview  of all  remand  orders.   The  Court  held that  the\n\nstatute's  \"review  bar\"  applies  only  to  a  statutorily-\n\nlimited, previously-mentioned set of remand orders,  namely,\n\nthose in  which remand  rests upon a  defect in  the removal\n\nproceeding.  See 28 U.S.C.    1447(c).  The Court, referring\n                \n\nto an 1875 case, Railroad Co. v. Wiswall, 90 U.S. (23 Wall.)\n                                        \n\n507  (1875), also  held  that  other  remand  orders,  while\n\nreviewable, were  not  \"final\"  orders  and  therefore  were\n\nreviewable only through  mandamus.  Id. at 508.   The remand\n                                      \n\norder in this case falls  outside the scope of the statutory\n\n\"review bar.\"  But, it would  seem to fall within the  scope\n\nof the Supreme  Court's holding that review  must take place\n\nthrough mandamus, not appeal.\n\n          The  IRS points  out  that several  appeals courts\n\nhave  created an exception  to Thermtron for  (and permitted\n                                        \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nappeal  of)   reviewable  remand  orders   that  amount   to\n\n\"collateral orders.\"   See,  e.g., McDermott  Int'l Inc.  v.\n                                                        \n\nLloyds Underwriters of London, 944 F.2d 1199, 1204 (5th Cir.\n                             \n\n1991)  (permitting appeal of remand order based on separable\n\nissue presented  by a contract's \"forum  selection\" clause),\n\ncert.  denied, 113 S. Ct.  2442 (1993); Foster v. Chesapeake\n                                                            \n\nIns. Co., Ltd., 933 F.2d 1207, 1211 &amp; n.6 (3d  Cir.)

Corp., 838 F.2d 656, 658-59\n                                      \n\n&amp;  n.1 (2d Cir.  1988) (same); Pelleport  Investors, Inc. v.\n                                                         \n\nBudco Quality Theatres, Inc., 741 F.2d 273, 277-78 (9th Cir.\n                            \n\n1984) (same).  It adds that we should recognize an exception\n\npermitting appeal here.  \n\n          We are aware of arguments advanced  for modifying,\n\nor  finding exceptions  to,  Thermtron.   Commentators  have\n                                      \n\nargued that the Supreme Court should have  departed from its\n\nearlier, nineteenth-century practice and found remand orders\n\n\"final\" (hence,  in principle,  appealable) because  1) they\n\nfinally dispose of the federal proceedings; and, 2) there is\n                              \n\nlittle practical reason not to permit appeal of those remand\n\norders  that fall outside  section 1447(d)'s  statutory bar.\n\n15A Charles A. Wright, Arthur  R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure   3914.11, at 702-18  (2d ed.\n                              \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n1991).   Critics have  also pointed to  anomalies.  Suppose,\n\nfor  example,  that  a federal  district  court,  wishing to\n\nabstain pending  resolution of  state proceedings,  embodies\n\nits decision in a stay of federal proceedings.   The stay is\n\nappealable.  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr.\n                                                            \n\nCorp., 460  U.S. 1,  8-10 (1983).   Suppose that  same court\n     \n\nembodies its decision in a  remand (and, say, the  plaintiff\n\nreserves the right to  return to federal court, see  England\n                                                            \n\nv. Louisiana State  Bd. of Medical  Examiners, 375 U.S.  411\n                                             \n\n(1964)).  The parties would have no appeal as of right,  but\n\nwould have to seek  \"discretionary\" review through mandamus.\n\nCf. Roche v.  Evaporated Milk Ass'n, 319 U.S.  21, 25 (1943)\n                                   \n\n(mandamus  is  discretionary).    The result  is  anomalous.\n\nCorcoran v.  Ardra Ins.  Co., Ltd., 842  F.2d 31,  34-35 (2d\n                                  \n\nCir. 1988).   And, one can find other  examples of practical\n\nreview  difficulties,  particularly  when, say,  a  district\n\ncourt  couples dismissal  of a  removed  federal claim  with\n\nremand of pendent state claims. 15A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper,\n\nsupra,   3914.11, at 710-18;  see also In re Amoco Petroleum\n                                                            \n\nAdditives Co., 964 F.2d 706 (7th Cir. 1992).\n             \n\n          Despite  these difficulties, we  do not believe we\n\ncan  find an exception that fits the  present case.  For one\n\nthing, the Supreme Court's language is rather absolute.   It\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nsays clearly that a remand order is not  \"final.\"  The Court\n\nrests  its  decision  upon  older  cases  that  reflect  the\n\napparently then-common  practice of  appellate courts  using\n\nmandamus, rather than appeal, to  review the lawfulness of a\n\nlower court's  refusal to  assert jurisdiction  (of which  a\n\nremand is one variety).  Wiswall, 90 U.S. (23 Wall.) at 508.\n                                \n\nThe Court, more recently, has approved circuit  court use of\n\nmandamus as  a vehicle for review.  Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v.\n                                                         \n\nCohill, 484 U.S.  343, 355-56  (1988).   And, lower  courts,\n      \n\neven  when faced  with anomalies,  have  concluded that  the\n\nSupreme Court  meant what  it said.   In re  Amoco Petroleum\n                                                            \n\nAdditives Co., 964 F.2d at 713; Corcoran, 842 F.2d at 34-35.\n                                        \n\n          For another thing,  we do not believe  it possible\n\nto apply  a \"collateral order\"  exception here.   See  cases\n                                                     \n\ncited at pp.  5-6, supra.   The \"collateral order\"  doctrine\n                        \n\npermits parties to appeal (as \"final decisions,\" 28 U.S.C.  \n\n1291) orders that \"determine\"  a \"disputed\" and  \"important\"\n\nissue \"separate from  the merits of  the action,\" which  are\n\n\"effectively unreviewable\"  on a  later appeal.   Coopers  &amp;\n                                                            \n\nLybrand v.  Livesay, 437 U.S.  463, 468 (1978).   The record\n                   \n\nhere does not set  forth the relation  of the remand to  any\n\nremaining issues  in sufficient  detail for  us to  say with\n\nconfidence  that the remand order rests on the determination\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nof an issue \"separate from the merits of  the action.\"  But,\n\nmore importantly, Thermtron  and Wiswall themselves  seem to\n                                        \n\ninvolve  \"collateral  orders.\"    In  Thermtron,  the  Court\n                                               \n\nreviewed   (through  mandamus)   a   district  court   order\n\n(erroneously) remanding  the case to  a state  court on  the\n\nground  that  the state  court  would handle  the  case more\n\nexpeditiously.     That   remand   decision  determined   an\n\nimportant, separate,  disputed issue that  could not  easily\n\nhave  been reviewed  later through  appeal.   Similarly,  in\n\nWiswall,  the Court reviewed (through mandamus, prior to the\n       \n\nenactment of   1447(d)) a lower court's important, separate,\n\ndisputed decision  to remand  the  case to  state court  for\n\njurisdictional reasons.  The upshot is that we cannot find a\n\n\"collateral  order\" exception large  enough to fit  our case\n\nthat does not also swallow up (and thereby simply disregard)\n\nthe general rule.\n\n          Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we need not\n\nfurther  complicate  the  law   with  additional  exceptions\n\nbecause  the case before  us meets Thermtron's  criteria for\n                                            \n\nthe  issuance of  mandamus.    This  case,  like  Thermtron,\n                                                           \n\ninvolves the  \"traditional use of the writ  [of mandamus] in\n\naid of appellate  jurisdiction to compel\" a  lower court \"to\n\nexercise\"  its jurisdictional \"authority when it is its duty\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nto do so.\"  Roche, 319 U.S. at 26, quoted in  Thermtron, 423\n                                                       \n\nU.S. at 352.

Nonetheless,  in our  view, the\n       \n\nIRS's  right to  relief  here,  after  the  Supreme  Court's\n\ndecision in  Fabe, supra, is reasonably clear;  its need for\n                        \n\nrelief is fairly urgent; and, the fact that the remand falls\n\noutside    1447(d)'s  review  bar itself  helps to  make the\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nremand unusual.  Taken together, these circumstances justify\n\nexercising our \"discretion\" in favor of issuing the writ.  \n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n                            III\n\n                        Pre-emption\n                                   \n\n          The  IRS argues that  the federal court  was wrong\n\nnot  to retain  the case  and order  payment of  the $53,000\n\nbecause  federal  law  governs the  case  and  requires that\n\npayment.   The  federal law  in  question is  a statute,  31\n\nU.S.C.   3713, which says:\n\n          A claim of the United States  Government\n          shall be paid first when  . . . a person\n          indebted to the  Government is insolvent\n          and  . .  .  an  act  of  bankruptcy  is\n          committed.\n\nThe Insurance  Commissioner agrees that  this statute  would\n\nentitle  the United States  to priority (and,  apparently to\n\npayment) were it not for a Commonwealth statute that governs\n\ninsurance  company liquidations.   That statute, as  we have\n\nsaid, instructs the Insurance Commissioner to set a deadline\n\nfor presenting proofs of claims, and it adds:\n\n          Proofs of claim  may be filed subsequent\n          to the date specified, but no such claim\n                                                  \n          shall share  in the distribution  of the\n                                                  \n          assets until all  allowed claims, proofs\n                                                  \n          of  which  have been  filed  before said\n                                                  \n          date,  have  been  paid  in  full   with\n                                                  \n          interest.\n                  \n\nP.R.

We cannot  reconcile\n\nthe federal statute  with the Commonwealth statute  (say, by\n\nreading it as limited to instances of compliance with  state\n\nprocedures),  for the  courts have  consistently interpreted\n\nthe   federal  statute   as   overriding  state   procedural\n\nrequirements of  the sort  here at issue  (at least  where a\n\ntrustee has  appropriate notice  of federal  claims).   See,\n                                                           \n\ne.g., Brown  v.

If  ordinary\n\npre-emption  principles  apply,  then  the  federal  statute\n\ngoverns.   Gibbons v. Ogden,  22 U.S. 1 (1824);  U.S. Const.\n                           \n\nArt. VI, cl.2.\n\n          The pre-emption inquiry  here is more complicated,\n\nhowever,  because the Insurance Commissioner argues that the\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nCommonwealth's law regulates insurance companies and (as  we\n\nshall assume for  argument's sake) that IPD  is an insurance\n\ncompany.  A special federal statute says:\n\n          No Act of Congress shall be construed to\n          invalidate, impair, or supersede any law\n          enacted by any State  for the purpose of\n          regulating the business of insurance . .\n          . unless  such Act  specifically relates\n          to the business of insurance . . . . \n\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act   2(b), 15 U.S.C.   1012(b).\n\n          This  statute, if it  were to apply,  would compel\n\nthe opposite result: the Commonwealth's priority system, not\n\nthe federal system,  would govern.  The basic legal question\n\nbefore us, then, is whether or  not the statute applies.  Is\n\nthe Commonwealth's procedurally-linked priority rule a  \"law\n\nenacted . .  . for the purpose of regulating the business of\n\ninsurance\"?   The  district  court,  relying  on  the  Sixth\n\nCircuit's holding in  Fabe, decided that the  answer to this\n                          \n\nquestion  was \"yes.\"   Fabe v.  Department of  Treasury, 939\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  341 (6th  Cir.  1991).   The  Supreme Court,  however,\n\ngranted certiorari in  Fabe.  And, that Court  has reached a\n                           \n\ndecision  that leads  us  to  reverse  the  district  court.\n\nDepartment of Treasury v. Fabe, supra.\n                                     \n\n          The Supreme Court, in Fabe, considered  separately\n                                    \n\nindividual   provisions   in  a   state   insurance-company-\n\nliquidation  statute, which  provisions provided  sequential\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\npriority for  (1) administrative costs;  (2) specified  wage\n\nclaims; (3)  policyholders' claims;  (4) general  creditors'\n\nclaims; and (5) government claims.  The Court held that some\n                                                            \n\nof  these priority provisions  (all comprising parts  of the\n\nlarger statute) amounted to laws \"enacted for the purpose of\n\nregulating the business  of insurance,\" but others  did not.\n\nIt said that \"to the extent\" a priority provision \"regulates\n\npolicyholders,\" it  \"is a  law enacted  for  the purpose  of\n\nregulating the business of insurance.\"   Fabe, 113 S. Ct. at\n                                             \n\n2212.  But to \"the extent that it is designed to further the\n\ninterests of other  creditors, . . . it is not a law enacted\n\nfor  the purpose of  regulating the business  of insurance.\"\n\nId.  \n  \n\n          The Court  then  found that  the  state  statute's\n\nfirst  priority  for  \"the  expense  of  administering   the\n\ninsolvency   proceeding\"    was   an    insurance-regulating\n\nprovision.   It  said  that  the  provision  \"is  reasonably\n\nnecessary to  further the goal of  protecting policyholders\"\n\nbecause, without  such a  provision, \"liquidation  could not\n\neven commence.\"  Id.  In contrast,  the Court found that the\n                   \n\n\"preferences conferred upon employees [for wage  claims] and\n\nother  general  creditors\"   were  not  insurance-regulating\n\nprovisions.  Id.   The Court said that  such preferences \"do\n               \n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nnot  escape  pre-emption  because  their  connection  to the\n\nultimate aim of insurance is too tenuous.\"  Id.\n                                              \n\n          The  Court's  reasoning  and examples  lead  us to\n\nconclude   that   the    federal   statute   pre-empts   the\n\nCommonwealth's  filing-deadline-related priority  provision.\n\nThe filing deadline  (with its penalty of  subordination for\n\nlate   claims)  cannot  be   said  to  directly  \"regulate[]\n\npolicyholders,\" for it is neither directed at, nor necessary\n\nfor, the protection of policyholders, as the Court required.\n\nThe  provision helps policyholders  only to the  extent that\n\n(and in the same way as) it helps all creditors.  That is to\n\nsay, by penalizing  late-filers, the Commonwealth  provision\n\nmay   bring   about   more   speedy,   orderly   liquidation\n\nproceedings,  thereby  (perhaps)  reducing  the  risks  (and\n\ncosts) of extending credit to the company.\n\n          Nor can  one say  that  the Commonwealth's  filing\n\ndeadline  provision  is  necessary  for  the  protection  of\n\npolicyholders.  The Court in  Fabe found that a priority for\n                                  \n\n\"administrative   expense[s]\"  was   necessary  to   protect\n\npolicyholders,  but,   because  without  such   a  priority,\n\nliquidation  might never occur.   The  Commonwealth's filing\n\ndeadline  at issue  here, however,  is not  necessary for  a\n\nliquidation.    Without it,  liquidation  would still  prove\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nmanageable.   At  worst,  the  trustee's  job  would  become\n\nslightly  more difficult.   He  would have  to provide,  for\n\nexample, the United States with  a first priority as long as\n\nhe had, say, actual notice (or \"constructive\" notice through\n\nrecording)  of the  claim, even  if he  did not  have formal\n\nnotice  through a  \"proof of  claim\" filed  directly  in the\n\nliquidation  proceeding.  See  cases cited at  p. 12, supra.\n                                                           \n\nRelieving  the  trustee  of  the  burden  of  searching  for\n\nrecorded liens  provides policyholders  with only  indirect,\n\nspeculative  benefit of the  kind that the  Fabe Court found\n                                                \n\nfar too  tenuous to prevent  pre-emption.  We  conclude that\n\nthe  special federal  pre-emption  statute  does not  apply.\n\nNormal pre-emption  rules do apply.   And, federal  law must\n\ngovern.\n\n          The  Insurance  Commissioner   makes  one  further\n\nargument.   He  says that,  even if  the district  court was\n\nwrong about federal  pre-emption, the court was  still right\n\nto  remand the  case.  He  says the  remand rested  upon the\n\ndistrict court's authority to  \"abstain\" from exercising its\n\njurisdiction in  order to  allow the  Commonwealth court  to\n\nconduct further  insurance company  liquidation proceedings.\n\nSee Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943); Gonzalez v.\n                                                         \n\nMedia  Elements,  Inc.,   946  F.2d  157  (1st   Cir.  1991)\n                      \n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n(abstaining   to   permit    resolution,   in   Commonwealth\n\nliquidation  proceeding, of  a tort claim  against insolvent\n\ninsurance company).\n\n          The  problem with this argument lies in the record\n\nbefore us.  Burford holds that federal courts should abstain\n                   \n\nwhere  further  federal proceedings  would  likely  decide a\n\n\"difficult\"  state  law  question  or  would  disrupt  state\n\nefforts to  establish coherent and  important state  policy.\n\nBurford,  319 U.S.  at 331  &amp; n.28;  Bath Memorial  Hosp. v.\n                                                         \n\nMaine Health Care  Fin.

The Insurance Commissioner set May 19, 1988, as the filing deadline for \"proofs of claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1989, about one year after the filing deadline, the federal Internal Revenue Service filed with the Insurance Commissioner a formal \"proof\" of its claim against IPD for $53,000 (representing federal tax liens that the IRS, between 1982 and 1985, had asserted, and perfected, on IPD's assets).  In May 1991, the IRS intervened in the Commonwealth court liquidation proceedings.  26 U.S.C. Sec. 7424.  It asked for the $53,000, as to which a federal law gave it first priority.  31 U.S.C. Sec. 3713.  It also now tells us that, without a first priority, it will be unable to collect any of the money owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Commissioner opposed the IRS claim on the ground that the IRS had missed the (May 19, 1988) deadline for filing formal proofs of claim.  He pointed out that Puerto Rico's insurance company liquidation statute says that claims for which proofs are filed after the deadline shall not be paid until all timely-filed claims have been \"paid in full with interest.\"   P.R.Laws Ann., tit. 26, Sec. 4019(2).  And, in his view, Puerto Rico's priority system trumps the federal statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the IRS removed the case to federal court.  28 U.S.C. Secs. 1441(b), 1444.  The Insurance Commissioner asked the district court to \"abstain\" from deciding the legal issues, and to remand the case to the Commonwealth court.  The district court then wrote an opinion deciding the basic question and holding that Puerto Rico's priority law, not the federal priority statute, governs.  It also remanded the case to the Commonwealth court.  791 F.Supp. 338.   The IRS now asks us to review, and to reverse, the remand order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>Appeal or Mandamus?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not completely certain why the district court, having decided the major legal issue in the case, decided to remand it.  It may have done so as an administrative matter, to permit the Commonwealth court to enter a final judgment;  or because it believed the controversy involved other legal issues that it should \"abstain\" from deciding;  or simply because \"remand\" was the form of relief that the Insurance Commissioner had requested.  Whatever the reason, the fact of remand raises a technical question about the form of review:  Can the IRS simply appeal the remand order or must it seek a writ of mandamus?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem arises out of a Supreme Court case, Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 23 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), in which the Court considered the scope of a statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1447(d), that appeared to bar appellate review of all remand orders.  The Court held that the statute's \"review bar\" applies only to a statutorily-limited, previously-mentioned set of remand orders, namely, those in which remand rests upon a defect in the removal proceeding.  See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1447(c).  The Court, referring to an 1875 case, Railroad Co. v. Wiswall, 90 U.S.  (23 Wall.) 507, 23 L.Ed. 103 (1875), also held that other remand orders, while reviewable, were not \"final\" orders and therefore were reviewable only through mandamus.  Id. at 508, 23 L.Ed. 103.   The remand order in this case falls outside the scope of the statutory \"review bar.\"   But, it would seem to fall within the scope of the Supreme Court's holding that review must take place through mandamus, not appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS points out that several appeals courts have created an exception to Thermtron for (and permitted appeal of) reviewable remand orders that amount to \"collateral orders.\"   See, e.g., McDermott Int'l Inc. v. Lloyds Underwriters of London, 944 F.2d 1199, 1204 (5th Cir.1991) (permitting appeal of remand order based on separable issue presented by a contract's \"forum selection\" clause), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2442, 124 L.Ed.2d 660 (1993);  Foster v. Chesapeake Ins. Co., Ltd., 933 F.2d 1207, 1211 &amp; n. 6 (3d Cir.)  (same), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 302, 116 L.Ed.2d 245 (1991);  Karl Koch Erecting Co. v. New York Convention Ctr. Dev.  Corp., 838 F.2d 656, 658-59 &amp; n. 1 (2d Cir.1988) (same);  Pelleport Investors, Inc. v. Budco Quality Theatres, Inc., 741 F.2d 273, 277-78 (9th Cir.1984) (same).  It adds that we should recognize an exception permitting appeal here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are aware of arguments advanced for modifying, or finding exceptions to, Thermtron.   Commentators have argued that the Supreme Court should have departed from its earlier, nineteenth-century practice and found remand orders \"final\" (hence, in principle, appealable) because 1) they finally dispose of the federal proceedings;  and, 2) there is little practical reason not to permit appeal of those remand orders that fall outside section 1447(d)'s statutory bar.  15A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3914.11, at 702-18 (2d ed. 1991).  Critics have also pointed to anomalies.  Suppose, for example, that a federal district court, wishing to abstain pending resolution of state proceedings, embodies its decision in a stay of federal proceedings.  The stay is appealable.  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr.  Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 8-10, 103 S.Ct. 927, 932-34, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).  Suppose that same court embodies its decision in a remand (and, say, the plaintiff reserves the right to return to federal court, see England v. Louisiana State Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411, 84 S.Ct. 461, 11 L.Ed.2d 440 (1964)).  The parties would have no appeal as of right, but would have to seek \"discretionary\" review through mandamus.  Cf. Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass'n, 319 U.S. 21, 25, 63 S.Ct. 938, 941, 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943) (mandamus is discretionary).  The result is anomalous.  Corcoran v. Ardra Ins. Co., Ltd., 842 F.2d 31, 34-35 (2d Cir.1988).  And, one can find other examples of practical review difficulties, particularly when, say, a district court couples dismissal of a removed federal claim with remand of pendent state claims.  15A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, supra, Sec. 3914.11, at 710-18;  see also In re Amoco Petroleum Additives Co., 964 F.2d 706 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these difficulties, we do not believe we can find an exception that fits the present case.  For one thing, the Supreme Court's language is rather absolute.  It says clearly that a remand order is not \"final.\"   The Court rests its decision upon older cases that reflect the apparently then-common practice of appellate courts using mandamus, rather than appeal, to review the lawfulness of a lower court's refusal to assert jurisdiction (of which a remand is one variety).  Wiswall, 90 U.S.  (23 Wall.) at 508, 23 L.Ed. 103.   The Court, more recently, has approved circuit court use of mandamus as a vehicle for review.  Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 355-56, 108 S.Ct. 614, 621-22, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988).  And, lower courts, even when faced with anomalies, have concluded that the Supreme Court meant what it said. In re Amoco Petroleum Additives Co., 964 F.2d at 713;  Corcoran, 842 F.2d at 34-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, we do not believe it possible to apply a \"collateral order\" exception here.  See cases cited at p. 59, supra.   The \"collateral order\" doctrine permits parties to appeal (as \"final decisions,\" 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291) orders that \"determine\" a \"disputed\" and \"important\" issue \"separate from the merits of the action,\" which are \"effectively unreviewable\" on a later appeal.  Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2458, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978).  The record here does not set forth the relation of the remand to any remaining issues in sufficient detail for us to say with confidence that the remand order rests on the determination of an issue \"separate from the merits of the action.\"   But, more importantly, Thermtron and Wiswall themselves seem to involve \"collateral orders.\"   In Thermtron, the Court reviewed (through mandamus) a district court order (erroneously) remanding the case to a state court on the ground that the state court would handle the case more expeditiously.  That remand decision determined an important, separate, disputed issue that could not easily have been reviewed later through appeal.  Similarly, in Wiswall, the Court reviewed (through mandamus, prior to the enactment of Sec. 1447(d)) a lower court's important, separate, disputed decision to remand the case to state court for jurisdictional reasons.  The upshot is that we cannot find a \"collateral order\" exception large enough to fit our case that does not also swallow up (and thereby simply disregard) the general rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we need not further complicate the law with additional exceptions because the case before us meets Thermtron's criteria for the issuance of mandamus.  This case, like Thermtron, involves the \"traditional use of the writ [of mandamus] in aid of appellate jurisdiction to compel\" a lower court \"to exercise\" its jurisdictional \"authority when it is its duty to do so.\"  Roche, 319 U.S. at 26, 63 S.Ct. at 941 quoted in Thermtron, 423 U.S. at 352, 96 S.Ct. at 593-94.   Mandamus here, like mandamus in Thermtron, is not a substitute for appeal,  cf. Roche, 319 U.S. at 26-31, 63 S.Ct. at 941-44;   Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 97, 88 S.Ct. 269, 274-75, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967);   Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104, 110, 85 S.Ct. 234, 238, 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964), for Thermtron itself blocks immediate appeal;  and eventual appeal through the Commonwealth court system does not promise the IRS meaningful review of the federal district court's critical legal determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, even where a court of appeals has the \"power\" to issue mandamus, that relief is \"discretionary.\"   16 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper &amp; Eugene Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3933, at 213 (1977).  Appellate courts typically exercise this discretion only in somewhat unusual instances, In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653, 656 (1st Cir.1993), and where the petitioner's rights are \"clear and indisputable.\"  Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, 346 U.S. 379, 384, 74 S.Ct. 145, 148, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953);  In re Pearson, 990 F.2d at 656.   Nonetheless, in our view, the IRS's right to relief here, after the Supreme Court's decision in Fabe, supra, is reasonably clear;  its need for relief is fairly urgent;  and, the fact that the remand falls outside Sec. 1447(d)'s review bar itself helps to make the remand unusual.  Taken together, these circumstances justify exercising our \"discretion\" in favor of issuing the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Pre-emption</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS argues that the federal court was wrong not to retain the case and order payment of the $53,000 because federal law governs the case and requires that payment.  The federal law in question is a statute, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 3713, which says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A claim of the United States Government shall be paid first when ... a person indebted to the Government is insolvent and ... an act of bankruptcy is committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Commissioner agrees that this statute would entitle the United States to priority (and, apparently to payment) were it not for a Commonwealth statute that governs insurance company liquidations.  That statute, as we have said, instructs the Insurance Commissioner to set a deadline for presenting proofs of claims, and it adds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Proofs of claim may be filed subsequent to the date specified, but no such claim shall share in the distribution of the assets until all allowed claims, proofs of which have been filed before said date, have been paid in full with interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.Laws Ann., tit. 26, Sec. 4019(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two statutes conflict.  We cannot reconcile the federal statute with the Commonwealth statute (say, by reading it as limited to instances of compliance with state procedures), for the courts have consistently interpreted the federal statute as overriding state procedural requirements of the sort here at issue (at least where a trustee has appropriate notice of federal claims).  See, e.g., Brown v. Coleman, 318 Md. 56, 566 A.2d 1091 (1989) (federal priority cannot be superseded or impaired by state law);  United States v. Boots, 675 F.Supp. 550 (E.D.Mo.1987) (estate representative with actual, but not formal, notice of federal government's claim must pay that claim first);  United States v. Snyder, 207 F.Supp. 189 (E.D.Pa.1962) (under predecessor statute, United States could file claim long after distribution of estate in probate court);  United States v. Backus, 24 F.Cas. 932 (C.C.D.Mich.1855) (No. 14,491) (under predecessor statute, state proof of claim statutes were not binding on United States).  If ordinary pre-emption principles apply, then the federal statute governs.  Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S.  (9 Wheat.) 1, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824);  U.S. Const. Art.  VI, cl. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-emption inquiry here is more complicated, however, because the Insurance Commissioner argues that the Commonwealth's law regulates insurance companies and (as we shall assume for argument's sake) that IPD is an insurance company.  A special federal statute says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance ... unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarran-Ferguson Act Sec. 2(b), 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1012(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statute, if it were to apply, would compel the opposite result:  the Commonwealth's priority system, not the federal system, would govern.  The basic legal question before us, then, is whether or not the statute applies.  Is the Commonwealth's procedurally-linked priority rule a \"law enacted ... for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance\"?   The district court, relying on the Sixth Circuit's holding in Fabe, decided that the answer to this question was \"yes.\"  Fabe v. Department of Treasury, 939 F.2d 341 (6th Cir.1991).  The Supreme Court, however, granted certiorari in Fabe.   And, that Court has reached a decision that leads us to reverse the district court.  Department of Treasury v. Fabe, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, in Fabe, considered separately individual provisions in a state insurance-company-liquidation statute, which provisions provided sequential priority for (1) administrative costs;  (2) specified wage claims;  (3) policyholders' claims;  (4) general creditors' claims;  and (5) government claims.  The Court held that some of these priority provisions (all comprising parts of the larger statute) amounted to laws \"enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,\" but others did not.  It said that \"to the extent\" a priority provision \"regulates policyholders,\" it \"is a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\"  Fabe, --- U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2212.   But to \"the extent that it is designed to further the interests of other creditors, ... it is not a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court then found that the state statute's first priority for \"the expense of administering the insolvency proceeding\" was an insurance-regulating provision.  It said that the provision \"is reasonably necessary to further the goal of protecting policyholders\" because, without such a provision, \"liquidation could not even commence.\"  Id.  In contrast, the Court found that the \"preferences conferred upon employees [for wage claims] and other general creditors\" were not insurance-regulating provisions.  Id.  The Court said that such preferences \"do not escape pre-emption because their connection to the ultimate aim of insurance is too tenuous.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court's reasoning and examples lead us to conclude that the federal statute pre-empts the Commonwealth's filing-deadline-related priority provision.  The filing deadline (with its penalty of subordination for late claims) cannot be said to directly \"regulate[ ] policyholders,\" for it is neither directed at, nor necessary for, the protection of policyholders, as the Court required.  The provision helps policyholders only to the extent that (and in the same way as) it helps all creditors.  That is to say, by penalizing late-filers, the Commonwealth provision may bring about more speedy, orderly liquidation proceedings, thereby (perhaps) reducing the risks (and costs) of extending credit to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can one say that the Commonwealth's filing deadline provision is necessary for the protection of policyholders.  The Court in Fabe found that a priority for \"administrative expense[s]\" was necessary to protect policyholders, but, because without such a priority, liquidation might never occur.  The Commonwealth's filing deadline at issue here, however, is not necessary for a liquidation.  Without it, liquidation would still prove manageable.  At worst, the trustee's job would become slightly more difficult.  He would have to provide, for example, the United States with a first priority as long as he had, say, actual notice (or \"constructive\" notice through recording) of the claim, even if he did not have formal notice through a \"proof of claim\" filed directly in the liquidation proceeding.  See cases cited at p. 61, supra.   Relieving the trustee of the burden of searching for recorded liens provides policyholders with only indirect, speculative benefit of the kind that the Fabe Court found far too tenuous to prevent pre-emption.  We conclude that the special federal pre-emption statute does not apply.  Normal pre-emption rules do apply.  And, federal law must govern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Commissioner makes one further argument.  He says that, even if the district court was wrong about federal pre-emption, the court was still right to remand the case.  He says the remand rested upon the district court's authority to \"abstain\" from exercising its jurisdiction in order to allow the Commonwealth court to conduct further insurance company liquidation proceedings.  See Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943);  Gonzalez v. Media Elements, Inc., 946 F.2d 157 (1st Cir.1991) (abstaining to permit resolution, in Commonwealth liquidation proceeding, of a tort claim against insolvent insurance company).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this argument lies in the record before us.  Burford holds that federal courts should abstain where further federal proceedings would likely decide a \"difficult\" state law question or would disrupt state efforts to establish coherent and important state policy.  Burford, 319 U.S. at 331 &amp; n. 28, 63 S.Ct. at 1106 &amp; n. 28;  Bath Memorial Hosp. v. Maine Health Care Fin.  Comm'n, 853 F.2d 1007, 1013-14 (1st Cir.1988);  see also Fragoso v. Lopez, 991 F.2d 878, 882-85 (1st Cir.1993).  Nothing in the record before us explains how, or why, further federal proceedings would create any such problems.  Thus, it offers no justification for court abstention based on Burford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed, and the petition for mandamus, setting aside the district court's remand order, is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

P.R.Laws Ann., tit. 26, Sec. 4019(2).  A special federal statute, governing federal pre-emption of state insurance laws, 15 U.S.C.

P.R.Laws Ann., tit. 26, Secs. 4002, 4019.  In February 1987, the Insurance Commissioner began proceedings, in a Commonwealth court, to liquidate the assets of Island Program Designer, Inc.  (\"IPD\"), a health maintenance organization.  The Insurance Commissioner set May 19, 1988, as the filing deadline for \"proofs of claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1989, about one year after the filing deadline, the federal Internal Revenue Service filed with the Insurance Commissioner a formal \"proof\" of its claim against IPD for $53,000 (representing federal tax liens that the IRS, between 1982 and 1985, had asserted, and perfected, on IPD's assets).  In May 1991, the IRS intervened in the Commonwealth court liquidation proceedings.  26 U.S.C. Sec. 7424.  It asked for the $53,000, as to which a federal law gave it first priority.  31 U.S.C. Sec. 3713.  It also now tells us that, without a first priority, it will be unable to collect any of the money owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Commissioner opposed the IRS claim on the ground that the IRS had missed the (May 19, 1988) deadline for filing formal proofs of claim.  He pointed out that Puerto Rico's insurance company liquidation statute says that claims for which proofs are filed after the deadline shall not be paid until all timely-filed claims have been \"paid in full with interest.\"   P.R.Laws Ann., tit. 26, Sec. 4019(2).  And, in his view, Puerto Rico's priority system trumps the federal statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the IRS removed the case to federal court.  28 U.S.C. Secs. 1441(b), 1444.  The Insurance Commissioner asked the district court to \"abstain\" from deciding the legal issues, and to remand the case to the Commonwealth court.  The district court then wrote an opinion deciding the basic question and holding that Puerto Rico's priority law, not the federal priority statute, governs.  It also remanded the case to the Commonwealth court.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></span>.   The IRS now asks us to review, and to reverse, the remand order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>Appeal or Mandamus?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not completely certain why the district court, having decided the major legal issue in the case, decided to remand it.  It may have done so as an administrative matter, to permit the Commonwealth court to enter a final judgment;  or because it believed the controversy involved other legal issues that it should \"abstain\" from deciding;  or simply because \"remand\" was the form of relief that the Insurance Commissioner had requested.  Whatever the reason, the fact of remand raises a technical question about the form of review:  Can the IRS simply appeal the remand order or must it seek a writ of mandamus?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem arises out of a Supreme Court case, Thermtron Products, Inc. v.

Commentators have argued that the Supreme Court should have departed from its earlier, nineteenth-century practice and found remand orders \"final\" (hence, in principle, appealable) because 1) they finally dispose of the federal proceedings;  and, 2) there is little practical reason not to permit appeal of those remand orders that fall outside section 1447(d)'s statutory bar.  15A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3914.11, at 702-18 (2d ed. 1991).  Critics have also pointed to anomalies.  Suppose, for example, that a federal district court, wishing to abstain pending resolution of state proceedings, embodies its decision in a stay of federal proceedings.  The stay is appealable.

And, one can find other examples of practical review difficulties, particularly when, say, a district court couples dismissal of a removed federal claim with remand of pendent state claims.  15A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, supra, Sec. 3914.11, at 710-18;  see also In re Amoco Petroleum Additives Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583671\"><a href=\"/opinion/583671/in-the-matter-of-amoco-petroleum-additives-company-and-buck-isbell-in-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span> </a></span>(7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these difficulties, we do not believe we can find an exception that fits the present case.  For one thing, the Supreme Court's language is rather absolute.  It says clearly that a remand order is not \"final.\"   The Court rests its decision upon older cases that reflect the apparently then-common practice of appellate courts using mandamus, rather than appeal, to review the lawfulness of a lower court's refusal to assert jurisdiction (of which a remand is one variety).  Wiswall, 90 U.S.  (23 Wall.) at 508, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89131\"><a href=\"/opinion/89131/railroad-co-v-wiswall/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

See cases cited at p. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">59,</span> supra</span>.   The \"collateral order\" doctrine permits parties to appeal (as \"final decisions,\" 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291) orders that \"determine\" a \"disputed\" and \"important\" issue \"separate from the merits of the action,\" which are \"effectively unreviewable\" on a later appeal.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span> </a></span>(1978).  The record here does not set forth the relation of the remand to any remaining issues in sufficient detail for us to say with confidence that the remand order rests on the determination of an issue \"separate from the merits of the action.\"   But, more importantly, Thermtron and Wiswall themselves seem to involve \"collateral orders.\"   In Thermtron, the Court reviewed (through mandamus) a district court order (erroneously) remanding the case to a state court on the ground that the state court would handle the case more expeditiously.  That remand decision determined an important, separate, disputed issue that could not easily have been reviewed later through appeal.  Similarly, in Wiswall, the Court reviewed (through mandamus, prior to the enactment of Sec. 1447(d)) a lower court's important, separate, disputed decision to remand the case to state court for jurisdictional reasons.  The upshot is that we cannot find a \"collateral order\" exception large enough to fit our case that does not also swallow up (and thereby simply disregard) the general rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we need not further complicate the law with additional exceptions because the case before us meets Thermtron's criteria for the issuance of mandamus.  This case, like Thermtron, involves the \"traditional use of the writ [of mandamus] in aid of appellate jurisdiction to compel\" a lower court \"to exercise\" its jurisdictional \"authority when it is its duty to do so.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103820\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Roche,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/103820/roche-v-evaporated-milk-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 63 S.Ct. at 941 quoted in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109348\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Thermtron,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/109348/thermtron-products-inc-v-hermansdorfer/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. at 593-94.

Sec. 3713, which says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A claim of the United States Government shall be paid first when ... a person indebted to the Government is insolvent and ... an act of bankruptcy is committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Commissioner agrees that this statute would entitle the United States to priority (and, apparently to payment) were it not for a Commonwealth statute that governs insurance company liquidations.  That statute, as we have said, instructs the Insurance Commissioner to set a deadline for presenting proofs of claims, and it adds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Proofs of claim may be filed subsequent to the date specified, but no such claim shall share in the distribution of the assets until all allowed claims, proofs of which have been filed before said date, have been paid in full with interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.Laws Ann., tit. 26, Sec. 4019(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two statutes conflict.  We cannot reconcile the federal statute with the Commonwealth statute (say, by reading it as limited to instances of compliance with state procedures), for the courts have consistently interpreted the federal statute as overriding state procedural requirements of the sort here at issue (at least where a trustee has appropriate notice of federal claims).  See, e.g., Brown v. Coleman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008555\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008555/brown-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008555\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008555/brown-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span> </a></span>(1989) (federal priority cannot be superseded or impaired by state law);  United States v.

If ordinary pre-emption principles apply, then the federal statute governs.  Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S.  (9 Wheat.) 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85412\"><a href=\"/opinion/85412/gibbons-v-ogden/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span> </a></span>(1824);  U.S. Const. Art.  VI, cl. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-emption inquiry here is more complicated, however, because the Insurance Commissioner argues that the Commonwealth's law regulates insurance companies and (as we shall assume for argument's sake) that IPD is an insurance company.  A special federal statute says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance ... unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarran-Ferguson Act Sec. 2(b), 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1012(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statute, if it were to apply, would compel the opposite result:  the Commonwealth's priority system, not the federal system, would govern.  The basic legal question before us, then, is whether or not the statute applies.  Is the Commonwealth's procedurally-linked priority rule a \"law enacted ... for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance\"?   The district court, relying on the Sixth Circuit's holding in Fabe, decided that the answer to this question was \"yes.\"  Fabe v. Department of Treasury, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565020\"><a href=\"/opinion/565020/george-fabe-superintendent-of-insurance-state-of-ohio-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span> </a></span>(6th Cir.1991).  The Supreme Court, however, granted certiorari in Fabe.   And, that Court has reached a decision that leads us to reverse the district court.  Department of Treasury v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112880\"><a href=\"/opinion/112880/department-of-treasury-v-fabe/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Fabe,</span> supra</a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, in Fabe, considered separately individual provisions in a state insurance-company-liquidation statute, which provisions provided sequential priority for (1) administrative costs;  (2) specified wage claims;  (3) policyholders' claims;  (4) general creditors' claims;  and (5) government claims.  The Court held that some of these priority provisions (all comprising parts of the larger statute) amounted to laws \"enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,\" but others did not.  It said that \"to the extent\" a priority provision \"regulates policyholders,\" it \"is a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\"  Fabe, --- U.S. at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112880\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">----,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/112880/department-of-treasury-v-fabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> at <span class=\"page\">2212</span></a></span>.   But to \"the extent that it is designed to further the interests of other creditors, ... it is not a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court then found that the state statute's first priority for \"the expense of administering the insolvency proceeding\" was an insurance-regulating provision.  It said that the provision \"is reasonably necessary to further the goal of protecting policyholders\" because, without such a provision, \"liquidation could not even commence.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112880\"><a href=\"/opinion/112880/department-of-treasury-v-fabe/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  In contrast, </a></span>the Court found that the \"preferences conferred upon employees [for wage claims] and other general creditors\" were not insurance-regulating provisions.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112880\"><a href=\"/opinion/112880/department-of-treasury-v-fabe/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>  The Court </a></span>said that such preferences \"do not escape pre-emption because their connection to the ultimate aim of insurance is too tenuous.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court's reasoning and examples lead us to conclude that the federal statute pre-empts the Commonwealth's filing-deadline-related priority provision.  The filing deadline (with its penalty of subordination for late claims) cannot be said to directly \"regulate[ ] policyholders,\" for it is neither directed at, nor necessary for, the protection of policyholders, as the Court required.  The provision helps policyholders only to the extent that (and in the same way as) it helps all creditors.  That is to say, by penalizing late-filers, the Commonwealth provision may bring about more speedy, orderly liquidation proceedings, thereby (perhaps) reducing the risks (and costs) of extending credit to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can one say that the Commonwealth's filing deadline provision is necessary for the protection of policyholders.  The Court in Fabe found that a priority for \"administrative expense[s]\" was necessary to protect policyholders, but, because without such a priority, liquidation might never occur.  The Commonwealth's filing deadline at issue here, however, is not necessary for a liquidation.  Without it, liquidation would still prove manageable.  At worst, the trustee's job would become slightly more difficult.  He would have to provide, for example, the United States with a first priority as long as he had, say, actual notice (or \"constructive\" notice through recording) of the claim, even if he did not have formal notice through a \"proof of claim\" filed directly in the liquidation proceeding.  See cases cited at p. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">61,</span> supra</span>.   Relieving the trustee of the burden of searching for recorded liens provides policyholders with only indirect, speculative benefit of the kind that the Fabe Court found far too tenuous to prevent pre-emption.  We conclude that the special federal pre-emption statute does not apply.  Normal pre-emption rules do apply.  And, federal law must govern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Commissioner makes one further argument.  He says that, even if the district court was wrong about federal pre-emption, the court was still right to remand the case.  He says the remand rested upon the district court's authority to \"abstain\" from exercising its jurisdiction in order to allow the Commonwealth court to conduct further insurance company liquidation proceedings.

Sun Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103842\"><a href=\"/opinion/103842/burford-v-sun-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103842\"><a href=\"/opinion/103842/burford-v-sun-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
