Plaintiff Karen\n                                         \n\nSuarez  Matos, a resident  of New York  vacationing in Puerto\n\nRico, was  taken to defendant  Ashford Presbyterian Community\n\nHospital  in San  Juan on  October 30,  1989 on  an emergency\n\nbasis.   A uterine tumor, or myoma, was removed the following\n\nday,  and  thereafter  examined   by  defendant  Doctor  Jose\n\nCarrasco,  a pathologist on the  staff of the  hospital.  He,\n\nallegedly,  reported it was  benign.  On  discharge with that\n\ndiagnosis  plaintiff was advised to follow up with a New York\n\ndoctor, two names being  given.  Beyond a clinic  visit, this\n\nshe failed to  do, but after five months she  again felt pain\n\nand  was  found, too  late, cancerous  beyond  cure.   It was\n\nconcluded  that her  tumor  had  been  an unusual  type,  and\n\nmalignant or  in danger of  becoming so, calling  for careful\n\nwatching.    Concededly  she had  not  been  so  advised.   A\n\ndistrict   court  jury  found   Doctor  Carrasco   guilty  of\n\nmalpractice,  and that  the hospital  was chargeable  for his\n\nconduct.  It awarded  $1,325,000 against both, which included\n\n$650,000  for future  medicals and  care, with  an additional\n\n$250,000  in   favor  of  plaintiff  Carmen   Matos,  Karen's\n\nmother.1   By  prior stipulation  it followed  that defendant\n\nCorporacion  Insular  de  Seguros,  Inc.  (CIS),  defendants'\n\n                    \n\n1.  The term  plaintiff hereafter,  if used in  the singular,\nshall be taken to refer to Karen.\n\n                             -4-\n\ninsurer, was liable.2   The  court refused  to recognize  the\n\npolicy limits of $250,000  per incident and entered judgments\n\nagainst CIS for the full amounts.  Appeals followed.\n\n          The appeals raise a number of matters:  whether the\n\nevidence warranted  the finding of malpractice against Doctor\n\nCarrasco; whether his conduct was chargeable to the hospital;\n\nwhether the  court erred  in disregarding the  policy limits;\n\nand evidentiary questions of damages.  In  addition, there is\n\na question whether  there should  be a new  trial because  of\n\nimproper  argument.   Our  overall conclusion  is that  while\n\nthere  was evidence warranting findings against defendants, a\n\nnew trial is called for.\n\n          The  initial  question  is  whether  a  finding  of\n\nnegligence  was  warranted  against  Doctor  Carrasco.    The\n\nevidence  here  is  singular.   With  their  early  witnesses\n\nplaintiffs  made a good showing that the tumor was unusual --\n\none in 500 -- and that if it had been recognized as unusual a\n\nfurther study should have been made to inquire as to possible\n\nmalignancy.  However, they made a  doubtful showing whether a\n\nmistake in failing to  recognize would amount to malpractice.\n\nSecond,  plaintiffs' doctors  agreed  that Doctor  Carrasco's\n\nreport  to  the surgeon  denied  malignancy,  their testimony\n\n                    \n\n2.  The amended  complaint  had originally  named  two  other\nhospital  doctors, Dr. Jose Juncosa and  Dr. Angel Lopez Ruiz\nand  their  separate  insurer,  but   plaintiffs  voluntarily\ndismissed against them before pretrial.\n\n                             -5-\n\nrevolving  around the words used  in the report.   The report\n\ndescribed the tumor as a leiomyoma-leiomyoblastoma.  A Doctor\n\nLazarevic, a pathologist called by plaintiffs, testified that\n\nthe  second  word  meant  benign,  and  that  if  there  were\n\nmalignant cells  this word  should have been  leiomyosarcoma.\n\nDoctor  Lopez, the  admitting  physician,  testified that  he\n\nlooked up  the term  leiomyoblastoma in a  medical dictionary\n\nand found it meant \"usually  benign.\"  However, he  testified\n\nthat  Doctor  Carrasco  told  him that  blastoma  meant  non-\n\ncancerous.   Doctor Juncosa, the  operating physician, though\n\nwithout  referring   to   a  dictionary,   confirmed   Doctor\n\nLazarevic.    He  testified, without  objection,  that Doctor\n\nLopez  had told him that Doctor Carrasco had told him, Doctor\n\nLopez, that the tumor was benign.\n\n          In this circumstance one might have expected Doctor\n\nCarrasco to testify that he had made an honest mistake in his\n\ndiagnosis,  and had,  accordingly,  not pursued  the  matter.\n\nInstead, after  testifying that  he was expecting  a \"routine\n\nleiomyoma\" he stated,\n\n          \"Upon   looking   at    it   I    noticed\n          immediately,  this  is   not  a   routine\n          leiomyoma,  not  the  typical  leiomyoma,\n          benign lesion. . . .   Leiomyoblastoma is\n          a tumor that nobody knows exactly what it\n          is  going to  do.   Many  of them  become\n          outright    malignant     within    three\n          months. . . .  Leiomyoblastoma, which now\n          should   be   called  stromal   tumor  of\n          uncertain malignant potential -- which is\n          my  diagnosis --  this  tumor  should  be\n          considered, by anyone who  knows anything\n\n                             -6-\n\n          about  medicine  -- not  by dictionaries,\n          but  anyone who  is up  to date,  who has\n          gone to  all the latest meetings  -- as a\n          tumor      of      definite     malignant\n          potential. . . .   Leiomyoblastoma is the\n          name.  If you know pathology you know the\n          name.  If you are a surgeon and you don't\n          know that name, you better stop acting as\n          a surgeon.\"\n\n          In  addition to  the warning  that Doctor  Carrasco\n\ntestified was thus  apparent on  the face of  the report,  he\n\nstated he had told Doctor Juncosa the above and had shown him\n\na book confirming it.\n\n          From the jury's standpoint the case was complicated\n\nby  a Doctor Killackey, from New York, who, though admittedly\n\nnot   a  pathologist,   testified   that  Doctor   Carrasco's\n\nprocedures deviated  from the  standards of  medicine because\n\nhis diagnosis  was \"completely incorrect,\" which,  of course,\n\nis not  the test, and  that Doctor  Carrasco \"doesn't  really\n\nknow  what  it [leiomyoblastoma]  is.\"   She  added  that the\n\ndictionary meaning was not important.3\n\n          Without reviewing  further, it  is  enough to  say,\n\nthough  difficult,  that  the   jury  could  combine   Doctor\n\nCarrasco's  admission  that he  knew  of  the possibility  of\n\nmalignancy  and   Doctor  Juncosa's  statement   that  Doctor\n\nCarrasco told him  the reverse, and  thus prevent an  ordered\n\njudgment for defendants.  In other words, the jury could find\n\n                    \n\n3.  Plaintiffs' counsel  described  Doctor Killackey  to  the\njury as \"courageous.\"  He meant it as a compliment.\n\n                             -7-\n\nthat  Doctor  Carrasco admittedly  knew  that  the tumor  was\n\ndangerous but did not adequately convey this to the operating\n\ndoctor so that the vital warning never reached the plaintiff.\n\n          In this contest of credibility defendants were hurt\n\nby two  improprieties.   The first  was the  court's allowing\n\nplaintiffs after  calling a Doctor Miranda,  to cross-examine\n\nhim as a  hostile witness because  defendants had named  him,\n\npretrial, as their proposed expert.  This was error.\n\n          Fed. R. Evid. 611 (c) reads as follows.\n\n               (c)    Leading  questions.   Leading\n               (c)    Leading  questions.\n          questions  should  not  be  used  on  the\n          direct examination of a witness except as\n          may  be necessary to develop the witness'\n          testimony.   Ordinarily leading questions\n          should be permitted on cross-examination.\n          When a party calls  a hostile witness, an\n          adverse  party,  or a  witness identified\n          with an adverse party,  interrogation may\n          be by leading questions.\n\nThis is  an  enlargement of  a  prior rule,  and  necessarily\n\ninvolves some  factual interpretation, but we  divide it into\n\ntwo  categories;  a  witness  who  is  an  adverse  party  or\n\nidentified with one, or  is affirmatively viewable as hostile\n\nbecause of  the situation,  viz., classifiable in  advance as\n                               \n\nhostile,  Ellis v. City of Chicago, 667 F.2d 606, 612-13 (7th\n                                  \n\nCir.  1981), and  witnesses who demonstrate  hostility during\n\ntrial, United  States v. Brown,  603 F.2d 1022,  1025-26 (1st\n                              \n\nCir. 1979).  Doctor  Miranda had no prior connection  as part\n\nof the  scene, Ellis,  ante, or otherwise,  Chonich v.  Wayne\n                                                             \n\nCty. Community  College, 874 F.2d  359, 368 (6th  Cir. 1989),\n                       \n\n                             -8-\n\nas,  for  example,  an  employee, Perkins  v.  Volkswagen  of\n                                                             \n\nAmerica,  Inc., 596  F.2d  681, 682  (5th  Cir. 1979),  or  a\n              \n\ndefendant's girlfriend, United States  v. Hicks, 748 F.2d 854\n                                               \n\n(4th Cir. 1984).   We find no case involving  the adversary's\n\nproposed expert,  or suggesting  that simply because  a party\n\nexpects favorable  testimony from a witness,  the opponent is\n\nentitled  to  call  him, or  her,  as hostile.    If  a party\n\nproposes to call a happenstance witness to  an accident, does\n\nthat  mean the  other can  call him  and cross-examine?   The\n\nobligation  to  name  witnesses,  about to  be  expanded,  is\n\nintended  to  give  opportunity  to prepare,  not  to  afford\n\nprocedural advantages.   We add  that the court's  rule would\n\ntend to make experts who are reluctant to appear in the first\n\nplace  even more reluctant if they are to start with rigorous\n\ncross-examination before they have even made their statement.\n\n          Conceivably  plaintiffs might have  done as well by\n\nwaiting  and  cross-examining  Doctor  Miranda  after  he had\n\ntestified for defendants.   In any event, defendants did  not\n\nobject to the court's  allowing cross-examination and,  while\n\nregarding  the course  followed as  undesirable practice,  we\n\nwould not  find it  to be  plain error  affecting substantial\n\nrights where no  one objected  to it.   However, our  concern\n\nwith  this  issue  pales  compared  with plaintiffs'  closing\n\nargument  that   the  court,  rather   than  correcting,  cf.\n                                                            \n\nGonzalez-Marin v.  Equitable Life Assur. Soc.,  845 F.2d 1140\n                                             \n\n                             -9-\n\n(1st Cir. 1988), called permissible.   To begin with, counsel\n\nviolated the elementary rule  that counsel should never state\n\nhis  opinion.   Here it  was particularly  prejudicial as  he\n\ncondemned  opposing counsel, and appealed directly to jurors'\n\npersonal motives.\n\n               Now,  when I  helped  select you,  I\n          think  on  the  other  side  there--  and\n          again, this  is my  own opinion--  that I\n          saw these other lawyers on the other side\n          smiling, and I think I know why they were\n          smiling.    I  think  they  were  smiling\n          because--\n\n               MR.  FUSTER:  Your Honor, we object.\n          We don't think this is proper.\n\n               THE COURT:   Yes, what  do you  mean\n          they were smiling?\n\n               MR. CORDERO:   I  am going  to that.\n          Why?  Because there  are no ladies in the\n          jury, and they cannot feel--\n\n               THE COURT:  All right,  I will allow\n          the argument.  Permissible argument.   Go\n          ahead.\n\n               MR. CORDERO:  Thank you, your Honor.\n          When  I selected  you and  I think  I saw\n          them smiling--  and I am  just surmising.\n          I  may  even  be  speculating, I  may  be\n          arguing  to  you--  I am  sure  they were\n          thinking,  \"Aha,  not  one woman  on  the\n          jury,  and men  are not  as sensitive  to\n          damages and suffering as women.\"\n\n               Well,  if  that's  what   they  were\n          thinking, I think they were wrong.\n\n               You  know,  my  family   comes  from\n          Isabela,  all  of  them,  my  father,  my\n          grandfather, my great grandfather,  but I\n          happened  to be  born and  raised in  the\n          barrio in New York, and if anybody thinks\n          there was a macho, I think I was a macho.\n\n                             -10-\n\n          Look  at my  fist.   It  was broken  from\n          fighting  in the  streets.   My  nose was\n          broken in  six  places, and  I had  three\n          broken  ribs.   I was  a combat  infantry\n          officer in the army--\n\n               MR. FUSTER:  Your Honor--\n\n               THE COURT:  That's permissible.\n\n               MR. CORDERO:  And  I thought I was a\n          macho.   I was a  combat infantry officer\n          in the army.\n\n               And yet I can  say here today that I\n          feel  I'm as  macho  as any  man in  this\n          room, but  I'm also  a human being  and I\n          also have feeling and  I know that all of\n          you have feeling.   Because we all have a\n          mother, maybe we have  a sister, maybe we\n          have a daughter, and we don't want to see\n          them suffering.   And if they suffer,  we\n          suffer,  and that's  why I  helped select\n          you as  a jury,  because I know  that you\n          will understand what suffering is.\n\nCounsel added  that not  telling Karen  that she  had cancer,\n\n\"that to me would amount to murder.\"  He then offered his own\n\nevidence.   After  purporting to  quote testimony,  he added,\n\n\"Your recollection is better, but I know what he said.\"  \"The\n\nmistake  was that Doctor Carrasco put down 'leiomyoblastoma,'\n\nwhich the dictionaries and all the  other doctors meant (sic)\n\na benign  tumor.\"    This,  of  course,  was  incorrect;  the\n\nevidence was that the dictionary defined 'leiomyoblastoma' as\n\nusually benign.\n       \n\n          These  highly  objectionable  arguments  were  then\n\ncompounded in plaintiffs' rebuttal.\n\n               They  tell  you  \"Don't decide  this\n          case with your  heart.\"  Well, I'm  going\n\n                             -11-\n\n          to  say  something  else.   You  are  the\n          conscience  of this  community.   I  say,\n          decide  it  with  your  heart,  with your\n          head,  using  the ordinary  experience of\n          life.  That's how you decide a case.\n\nIt is difficult enough for a jury to decide a  case involving\n\nserious  suffering  dispassionately  upon  the  law  and  the\n\nevidence  without being  told that  the community  conscience\n\ncalls to decide with the heart.\n\n          The  total argument  was outrageous.   We  can only\n\nthink that  this experienced court,  in permitting it,  had a\n\nbad day.\n\n          It is true  that only the hospital, and  not Doctor\n\nCarrasco, objected, and there has  been a suggestion that the\n\nlatter  could have no rights, absent plain error.  See United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Saade,  652 F.2d  1126, 1136-37  (1st Cir.  1981).\n                \n\nThis suggestion we  might be slow to follow if  it led to one\n\nparty receiving a new trial and another, equally placed, not,\n\nsince a primary reason for an objection  is to give the court\n\nnotice.  This it had.  However, we need not reach this, as we\n\nwould consider it plain  error for a verdict to stand after a\n\njury had been so traumatized.  We suggest that the court also\n\nallowed emotional overplay when it permitted, as it noted, 45\n\nminutes  dwelling on  plaintiffs' pain  and suffering.   Even\n\nmore  do we believe the argument may have affected the jury's\n\nfinding  as to  future medicals  and care  -- an  amount that\n\n                             -12-\n\nwould seem unwarranted in any event -- but we need not make a\n\nfinal decision.\n\n          The court's ruling as to pleading these damages was\n\ncorrect.  Decisions  on what needs  to be pleaded  by way  of\n\nspecial   damages,4    are   sparse.      The   tendency   is\n\nliberalization.

We believe the purpose is to give\n         \n\nnotice; the more natural are  the damages, the less  pleading\n\nis needed.   Compare Great  American Ind. Co.  v.

If  the pathologist  was guilty  of\n\nmalpractice, it follows from Marquez Vega v. Martinez Rosado,\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\n4.  \"When  items of special damage are claimed, they shall be\nspecifically stated.\"  Fed.

On the  facts\n\nthat cannot  be avoided, under  Puerto Rico law  the hospital\n\nnecessarily   was   vicariously  liable   for   the  doctor's\n\nnegligence, if found and the jury finding, even if improperly\n\ninfluenced, was  necessarily correct.   As matter of  law the\n\nhospital was a joint actor in a joint enterprise.\n\n          Corporacion Insular de Seguros, Inc. (CIS)\n                                                    \n\n          The liability  of CIS, the insurer,  was a question\n\nof law for  the court, not  affected by plaintiffs'  improper\n\nargument  to the  jury.   Unfortunately, however,  it decided\n\nwrongly.   Pressed  by  CIS, on  finding  that judgments  had\n\nissued  against it  in the  full amounts  of the  verdicts in\n\nspite  of the policy limits, the court denied motions without\n\ngiving reasons.   There is  some question as  to under  which\n\nrule the motions should  lie.  The miscarriage of  justice is\n\nsuch that we do not pause to pursue that aspect, but consider\n\n                             -14-\n\nthe  substance briefly,  if only  to make  it clear  that the\n\ncourt's incorrect decision is not law of the case.5\n\n          In  plaintiffs' amended  complaint  it was  alleged\n\nthat  the liability  insurer  is  liable  \"up to  its  policy\n\nlimits.\"  In  a joint answer filed  on behalf of  Ashford and\n\nCIS it  was alleged  that plaintiffs' claims  against Ashford\n\n\"exceed the coverage limits provided by\" CIS to Ashford.  The\n\ntruth of this  answer was  known to plaintiffs  as it is  not\n\ndisputed that  the policies were  produced pretrial.   In the\n\ncourse of trial,  the parties conferred  with the court  with\n\nrespect  to  the  charge   and  special  questions,  and  the\n\nfollowing ensued.\n\n               MR. CORDERO (for plaintiffs):   Your\n          Honor, I would like the record to reflect\n          that  last  night  all of  us  agreed  in\n          chambers  that if there is a judgment for\n          or against  the hospital, the  Court will\n          enter  a  similar  judgment  against  the\n          insurance company, Corporacion Insular de\n          Seguros, in accordance with the terms and\n          conditions of the policy.\n\n               THE COURT:   That was the agreement,\n          I remember.\n\n               MR.   CORDERO:      That   was   the\n          agreement, your Honor.\n\n               MR.  FUSTER:   But  we didn't  agree\n          that  judgment would  be entered  in that\n          sense, but that is the way it should be.\n\n               THE COURT:  Well, yes, you did agree\n          that a  judgment be  entered to  the-- in\n\n                    \n\n5.  The  question of the  insurer's failure to  settle is not\nbefore us.\n\n                             -15-\n\n          accordance with the terms  and conditions\n          of the  policy.  That's certain.  Because\n          otherwise it  would  be officious.    You\n          know,  I agreed  to something  but missed\n          nothing.  We don't play games here.\n\n               MR.  FUSTER:    What  I  mean,  your\n          Honor,  is that  I agree  to it now.   We\n          didn't discuss it last night.\n\n               THE COURT:  No, we so much discussed\n          it that if you remember we agreed whether\n          we  should  say  \"to  the  limit  of  the\n          policy,\"  and  all   that,  and  then  we\n          reached  the  agreement  to  say  that in\n          accordance with the terms  and conditions\n          of the policy.\n\n               So do we agree  now that that is the\n          agreement?\n\n               MR. FUSTER:  Sure, we agree.\n\n               MR.    CORDERO:        That's    the\n          stipulation, Your Honor.\n\n(TT-A 1074-75).\n\n          Unhappily  the court's  statement,  \"We don't  play\n\ngames here\" proved  to be a false  prophesy.  The  first game\n\nbefore  us  is  found  in  plaintiffs'  brief.   \"Before  the\n\ninstructions were read  by the  trial judge to  the jury  all\n\nparties stipulated to  the court  that '. . . if  there is  a\n\njudgment for or against  the hospital the court will  enter a\n\nsimilar judgment  against the insurance  company, Corporacion\n\nInsular de Seguros.'   (TT-A 1074).\"  When we  check the cite\n\nwe discover  that the period  appearing in their  brief after\n\n\"de  Seguros\"  is plaintiffs'.   In  the  transcript it  is a\n\ncomma, followed by the  modification, \"in accordance with the\n\n                             -16-\n\nterms and  conditions of the  policy.\"  One does  not have to\n\nlook to the familiar principle that all words are presumed to\n\nhave meaning to recognize that  there is a difference between\n\nliable and liable in accordance with the terms and conditions\n\nof the  policy.   On reading  the transcript  further, quoted\n\nsupra,  we find that the  phrase plaintiffs chose  to omit in\n     \n\nthe  brief,  cut off  by  their false  period,  was precisely\n\nintended as a paraphrase of \"to the limit of the policy.\"  We\n\nare astonished.\n\n          There follow a number  of other contentions.  These\n\nnot  only do  not  answer the  above,  but they  are  equally\n\nunpersuasive  in  themselves.   We  give  one example:    CIS\n\nallegedly  waived the policy limit  by not listing  it in the\n\npre-trial memorandum  under Contested Issues.   It was  not a\n\ncontested  issue.     Plaintiffs  admitted  in  the   amended\n\ncomplaint  that  they  were  not claiming  above  any  limit;\n\ndefendant's answer asserted there was a limit; plaintiffs had\n\nseen the policies, and knew what it was.  Now they say it was\n\nwaived.  These are  the plaintiffs who charge  that defendant\n\nCIS's  attempt to  assert  the policy  limits is  \"misleading\n\ndouble talk.\"\n\n          The verdicts and judgments are vacated and the case\n\nremanded  for further proceedings  not inconsistent with this\n\nopinion.   These  should  be held  before a  different judge.\n\nRivera-Lopez v. Mun. of  Dorado, 979 F.2d 885, 887  (1st Cir.\n                               \n\n                             -17-\n\n1992).

This  obligation stands  even  if  plaintiffs  ultimately\nrecover.

A uterine tumor, or myoma, was removed the following day, and thereafter examined by defendant Doctor Jose Carrasco, a pathologist on the staff of the hospital.  He, allegedly, reported it was benign.  On discharge with that diagnosis plaintiff was advised to follow up with a New York doctor, two names being given.  Beyond a clinic visit, this she failed to do, but after five months she again felt pain and was found, too late, cancerous beyond cure.  It was concluded that her tumor had been an unusual type, and malignant or in danger of becoming so, calling for careful watching.  Concededly she had not been so advised.  A district court jury found Doctor Carrasco guilty of malpractice, and that the hospital was chargeable for his conduct.  It awarded $1,325,000 against both, which included $650,000 for future medicals and care, with an additional $250,000 in favor of plaintiff Carmen Matos, Karen's mother.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  By prior stipulation it followed that defendant Corporacion Insular de Seguros, Inc.  (CIS), defendants' insurer, was liable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court refused to recognize the policy limits of $250,000 per incident and entered judgments against CIS for the full amounts.  Appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeals raise a number of matters:  whether the evidence warranted the finding of malpractice against Doctor Carrasco;  whether his conduct was chargeable to the hospital;  whether the court erred in disregarding the policy limits;  and evidentiary questions of damages.  In addition, there is a question whether there should be a new trial because of improper argument.  Our overall conclusion is that while there was evidence warranting findings against defendants, a new trial is called for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial question is whether a finding of negligence was warranted against Doctor Carrasco.  The evidence here is singular.  With their early witnesses plaintiffs made a good showing that the tumor was unusual--one in 500--and that if it had been recognized as unusual a further study should have been made to inquire as to possible malignancy.  However, they made a doubtful showing whether a mistake in failing to recognize would amount to malpractice.  Second, plaintiffs' doctors agreed that Doctor Carrasco's report to the surgeon denied malignancy, their testimony revolving around the words used in the report.  The report described the tumor as a leiomyoma-leiomyoblastoma.  A Doctor Lazarevic, a pathologist called by plaintiffs, testified that the second word meant benign, and that if there were malignant cells this word should have been leiomyosarcoma.  Doctor Lopez, the admitting physician, testified that he looked up the term leiomyoblastoma in a medical dictionary and found it meant \"usually benign.\"   However, he testified that Doctor Carrasco told him that blastoma meant non-cancerous.  Doctor Juncosa, the operating physician, though without referring to a dictionary, confirmed Doctor Lazarevic.  He testified, without objection, that Doctor Lopez had told him that Doctor Carrasco had told him, Doctor Lopez, that the tumor was benign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circumstance one might have expected Doctor Carrasco to testify that he had made an honest mistake in his diagnosis, and had, accordingly, not pursued the matter.  Instead, after testifying that he was expecting a \"routine leiomyoma\" he stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>\"Upon looking at it I noticed immediately, this is not a routine leiomyoma, not the typical leiomyoma, benign lesion....  Leiomyoblastoma is a tumor that nobody knows exactly what it is going to do.  Many of them become outright malignant within three months....  Leiomyoblastoma, which now should be called stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential--which is my diagnosis--this tumor should be considered, by anyone who knows anything about medicine--not by dictionaries, but anyone who is up to date, who has gone to all the latest meetings--as a tumor of definite malignant potential....  Leiomyoblastoma is the name.  If you know pathology you know the name.  If you are a surgeon and you don't know that name, you better stop acting as a surgeon.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the warning that Doctor Carrasco testified was thus apparent on the face of the report, he stated he had told Doctor Juncosa the above and had shown him a book confirming it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the jury's standpoint the case was complicated by a Doctor Killackey, from New York, who, though admittedly not a pathologist, testified that Doctor Carrasco's procedures deviated from the standards of medicine because his diagnosis was \"completely incorrect,\" which, of course, is not the test, and that Doctor Carrasco \"doesn't really know what it [leiomyoblastoma] is.\"   She added that the dictionary meaning was not important.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without reviewing further, it is enough to say, though difficult, that the jury could combine Doctor Carrasco's admission that he knew of the possibility of malignancy and Doctor Juncosa's statement that Doctor Carrasco told him the reverse, and thus prevent an ordered judgment for defendants.  In other words, the jury could find that Doctor Carrasco admittedly knew that the tumor was dangerous but did not adequately convey this to the operating doctor so that the vital warning never reached the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this contest of credibility defendants were hurt by two improprieties.  The first was the court's allowing plaintiffs after calling a Doctor Miranda, to cross-examine him as a hostile witness because defendants had named him, pretrial, as their proposed expert.  This was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 611(c) reads as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) Leading questions.   Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony.  Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination.  When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by leading questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an enlargement of a prior rule, and necessarily involves some factual interpretation, but we divide it into two categories;  a witness who is an adverse party or identified with one, or is affirmatively viewable as hostile because of the situation, viz., classifiable in advance as hostile, Ellis v. City of Chicago, 667 F.2d 606, 612-13 (7th Cir.1981), and witnesses who demonstrate hostility during trial, United States v. Brown, 603 F.2d 1022, 1025-26 (1st Cir.1979).  Doctor Miranda had no prior connection as part of the scene, Ellis, ante, or otherwise, Chonich v. Wayne  Cty. Community College, 874 F.2d 359, 368 (6th Cir.1989), as, for example, an employee,  Perkins v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 596 F.2d 681, 682 (5th Cir.1979), or a defendant's girlfriend,  United States v. Hicks, 748 F.2d 854 (4th Cir.1984).  We find no case involving the adversary's proposed expert, or suggesting that simply because a party expects favorable testimony from a witness, the opponent is entitled to call him, or her, as hostile.  If a party proposes to call a happenstance witness to an accident, does that mean the other can call him and cross-examine?   The obligation to name witnesses, about to be expanded, is intended to give opportunity to prepare, not to afford procedural advantages.  We add that the court's rule would tend to make experts who are reluctant to appear in the first place even more reluctant if they are to start with rigorous cross-examination before they have even made their statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably plaintiffs might have done as well by waiting and cross-examining Doctor Miranda after he had testified for defendants.  In any event, defendants did not object to the court's allowing cross-examination and, while regarding the course followed as undesirable practice, we would not find it to be plain error affecting substantial rights where no one objected to it.  However, our concern with this issue pales compared with plaintiffs' closing argument that the court, rather than correcting, cf. Gonzalez-Marin v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., 845 F.2d 1140 (1st Cir.1988), called permissible.  To begin with, counsel violated the elementary rule that counsel should never state his opinion.  Here it was particularly prejudicial as he condemned opposing counsel, and appealed directly to jurors' personal motives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, when I helped select you, I think on the other side there--and again, this is my own opinion--that I saw these other lawyers on the other side smiling, and I think I know why they were smiling.

See United States v. Saade, 652 F.2d 1126, 1136-37 (1st Cir.1981).  This suggestion we might be slow to follow if it led to one party receiving a new trial and another, equally placed, not, since a primary reason for an objection is to give the court notice.  This it had.  However, we need not reach this, as we would consider it plain error for a verdict to stand after a jury had been so traumatized.  We suggest that the court also allowed emotional overplay when it permitted, as it noted, 45 minutes dwelling on plaintiffs' pain and suffering.  Even more do we believe the argument may have affected the jury's finding as to future medicals and care--an amount that would seem unwarranted in any event--but we need not make a final decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's ruling as to pleading these damages was correct.  Decisions on what needs to be pleaded by way of special damages,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> are sparse.  The tendency is liberalization. Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Sec. 1311 (1990).  We believe the purpose is to give notice;  the more natural are the damages, the less pleading is needed.  Compare Great American Indem. Co. v. Brown, 307 F.2d 306 (5th Cir.1962) (loss of earning capacity following personal injury) with Action Repair, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Co., 776 F.2d 143 (7th Cir.1985) (business loss following defamation).  We are satisfied with \"Karen will incur in (sic) extensive major medical costs and expenses and will require costly health care services until her death.\"   The subject had been opened;  defendants could seek details by inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For future purposes we make the following rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Ashford Hospital</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ashford appeals because the court permitted a finding that it was charged with responsibility for Doctor Carrasco's negligence.  If the pathologist was guilty of malpractice, it follows from Marquez Vega v. Martinez Rosado, 116 D.P.R. 487 (1985), that the hospital is liable also.  While strictly, perhaps, that decision contained dictum that we might distinguish, and certainly we need not adopt plaintiffs contention that it would impose liability in the case of an independent contractor having no other relationship with the hospital, it is clear here that granting staff privileges coupled with a joint sharing in profits, left the hospital fully responsible.  On the facts that cannot be avoided, under Puerto Rico law the hospital necessarily was vicariously liable for the doctor's negligence, if found and the jury finding, even if improperly influenced, was necessarily correct.  As matter of law the hospital was a joint actor in a joint enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Corporacion Insular de Seguros, Inc. (CIS)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liability of CIS, the insurer, was a question of law for the court, not affected by plaintiffs' improper argument to the jury.  Unfortunately, however, it decided wrongly.  Pressed by CIS, on finding that judgments had issued against it in the full amounts of the verdicts in spite of the policy limits, the court denied motions without giving reasons.  There is some question as to under which rule the motions should lie.  The miscarriage of justice is such that we do not pause to pursue that aspect, but consider the substance briefly, if only to make it clear that the court's incorrect decision is not law of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In plaintiffs' amended complaint it was alleged that the liability insurer is liable \"up to its policy limits.\"   In a joint answer filed on behalf of Ashford and CIS it was alleged that plaintiffs' claims against Ashford \"exceed the coverage limits provided by\" CIS to Ashford.  The truth of this answer was known to plaintiffs as it is not disputed that the policies were produced pretrial.  In the course of trial, the parties conferred with the court with respect to the charge and special questions, and the following ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

The first game before us is found in plaintiffs' brief.  \"Before the instructions were read by the trial judge to the jury all parties stipulated to the court that '... if there is a judgment for or against the hospital the court will enter a similar judgment against the insurance company, Corporacion Insular de Seguros.'  (TT-A 1074).\"   When we check the cite we discover that the period appearing in their brief after \"de Seguros\" is plaintiffs'.  In the transcript it is a comma, followed by the modification, \"in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy.\"   One does not have to look to the familiar principle that all words are presumed to have meaning to recognize that there is a difference between liable and liable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy.  On reading the transcript further, quoted supra, we find that the phrase plaintiffs chose to omit in the brief, cut off by their false period, was precisely intended as a paraphrase of \"to the limit of the policy.\"   We are astonished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There follow a number of other contentions.  These not only do not answer the above, but they are equally unpersuasive in themselves.  We give one example:  CIS allegedly waived the policy limit by not listing it in the pretrial memorandum under Contested Issues.  It was not a contested issue.  Plaintiffs admitted in the amended complaint that they were not claiming above any limit;  defendant's answer asserted there was a limit;  plaintiffs had seen the policies, and knew what it was.  Now they say it was waived.  These are the plaintiffs who charge that defendant CIS's attempt to assert the policy limits is \"misleading double talk.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdicts and judgments are vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

A uterine tumor, or myoma, was removed the following day, and thereafter examined by defendant Doctor Jose Carrasco, a pathologist on the staff of the hospital.  He, allegedly, reported it was benign.  On discharge with that diagnosis plaintiff was advised to follow up with a New York doctor, two names being given.  Beyond a clinic visit, this she failed to do, but after five months she again felt pain and was found, too late, cancerous beyond cure.  It was concluded that her tumor had been an unusual type, and malignant or in danger of becoming so, calling for careful watching.  Concededly she had not been so advised.  A district court jury found Doctor Carrasco guilty of malpractice, and that the hospital was chargeable for his conduct.  It awarded $1,325,000 against both, which included $650,000 for future medicals and care, with an additional $250,000 in favor of plaintiff Carmen Matos, Karen's mother.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  By prior stipulation it followed that defendant Corporacion Insular de Seguros, Inc.  (CIS), defendants' insurer, was liable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court refused to recognize the policy limits of $250,000 per incident and entered judgments against CIS for the full amounts.  Appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeals raise a number of matters:  whether the evidence warranted the finding of malpractice against Doctor Carrasco;  whether his conduct was chargeable to the hospital;  whether the court erred in disregarding the policy limits;  and evidentiary questions of damages.  In addition, there is a question whether there should be a new trial because of improper argument.  Our overall conclusion is that while there was evidence warranting findings against defendants, a new trial is called for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial question is whether a finding of negligence was warranted against Doctor Carrasco.  The evidence here is singular.  With their early witnesses plaintiffs made a good showing that the tumor was unusual--one in 500--and that if it had been recognized as unusual a further study should have been made to inquire as to possible malignancy.  However, they made a doubtful showing whether a mistake in failing to recognize would amount to malpractice.  Second, plaintiffs' doctors agreed that Doctor Carrasco's report to the surgeon denied malignancy, their testimony revolving around the words used in the report.  The report described the tumor as a leiomyoma-leiomyoblastoma.  A Doctor Lazarevic, a pathologist called by plaintiffs, testified that the second word meant benign, and that if there were malignant cells this word should have been leiomyosarcoma.  Doctor Lopez, the admitting physician, testified that he looked up the term leiomyoblastoma in a medical dictionary and found it meant \"usually benign.\"   However, he testified that Doctor Carrasco told him that blastoma meant non-cancerous.  Doctor Juncosa, the operating physician, though without referring to a dictionary, confirmed Doctor Lazarevic.  He testified, without objection, that Doctor Lopez had told him that Doctor Carrasco had told him, Doctor Lopez, that the tumor was benign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circumstance one might have expected Doctor Carrasco to testify that he had made an honest mistake in his diagnosis, and had, accordingly, not pursued the matter.  Instead, after testifying that he was expecting a \"routine leiomyoma\" he stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>\"Upon looking at it I noticed immediately, this is not a routine leiomyoma, not the typical leiomyoma, benign lesion....  Leiomyoblastoma is a tumor that nobody knows exactly what it is going to do.  Many of them become outright malignant within three months....  Leiomyoblastoma, which now should be called stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential--which is my diagnosis--this tumor should be considered, by anyone who knows anything about medicine--not by dictionaries, but anyone who is up to date, who has gone to all the latest meetings--as a tumor of definite malignant potential....  Leiomyoblastoma is the name.  If you know pathology you know the name.  If you are a surgeon and you don't know that name, you better stop acting as a surgeon.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the warning that Doctor Carrasco testified was thus apparent on the face of the report, he stated he had told Doctor Juncosa the above and had shown him a book confirming it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the jury's standpoint the case was complicated by a Doctor Killackey, from New York, who, though admittedly not a pathologist, testified that Doctor Carrasco's procedures deviated from the standards of medicine because his diagnosis was \"completely incorrect,\" which, of course, is not the test, and that Doctor Carrasco \"doesn't really know what it [leiomyoblastoma] is.\"   She added that the dictionary meaning was not important.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without reviewing further, it is enough to say, though difficult, that the jury could combine Doctor Carrasco's admission that he knew of the possibility of malignancy and Doctor Juncosa's statement that Doctor Carrasco told him the reverse, and thus prevent an ordered judgment for defendants.  In other words, the jury could find that Doctor Carrasco admittedly knew that the tumor was dangerous but did not adequately convey this to the operating doctor so that the vital warning never reached the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this contest of credibility defendants were hurt by two improprieties.  The first was the court's allowing plaintiffs after calling a Doctor Miranda, to cross-examine him as a hostile witness because defendants had named him, pretrial, as their proposed expert.  This was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 611(c) reads as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) Leading questions.   Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony.  Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination.

We find no case involving the adversary's proposed expert, or suggesting that simply because a party expects favorable testimony from a witness, the opponent is entitled to call him, or her, as hostile.  If a party proposes to call a happenstance witness to an accident, does that mean the other can call him and cross-examine?   The obligation to name witnesses, about to be expanded, is intended to give opportunity to prepare, not to afford procedural advantages.  We add that the court's rule would tend to make experts who are reluctant to appear in the first place even more reluctant if they are to start with rigorous cross-examination before they have even made their statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably plaintiffs might have done as well by waiting and cross-examining Doctor Miranda after he had testified for defendants.  In any event, defendants did not object to the court's allowing cross-examination and, while regarding the course followed as undesirable practice, we would not find it to be plain error affecting substantial rights where no one objected to it.  However, our concern with this issue pales compared with plaintiffs' closing argument that the court, rather than correcting, cf. Gonzalez-Marin v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505496\"><a href=\"/opinion/505496/neftali-gonzalez-marin-v-the-equitable-life-assurance-society-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1988), called permissible.

See United States v.

This suggestion we might be slow to follow if it led to one party receiving a new trial and another, equally placed, not, since a primary reason for an objection is to give the court notice.  This it had.  However, we need not reach this, as we would consider it plain error for a verdict to stand after a jury had been so traumatized.  We suggest that the court also allowed emotional overplay when it permitted, as it noted, 45 minutes dwelling on plaintiffs' pain and suffering.  Even more do we believe the argument may have affected the jury's finding as to future medicals and care--an amount that would seem unwarranted in any event--but we need not make a final decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's ruling as to pleading these damages was correct.

If the pathologist was guilty of malpractice, it follows from Marquez Vega v. Martinez Rosado, 116 D.P.R. 487 (1985), that the hospital is liable also.  While strictly, perhaps, that decision contained dictum that we might distinguish, and certainly we need not adopt plaintiffs contention that it would impose liability in the case of an independent contractor having no other relationship with the hospital, it is clear here that granting staff privileges coupled with a joint sharing in profits, left the hospital fully responsible.  On the facts that cannot be avoided, under Puerto Rico law the hospital necessarily was vicariously liable for the doctor's negligence, if found and the jury finding, even if improperly influenced, was necessarily correct.  As matter of law the hospital was a joint actor in a joint enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Corporacion Insular de Seguros, Inc.

Unfortunately, however, it decided wrongly.  Pressed by CIS, on finding that judgments had issued against it in the full amounts of the verdicts in spite of the policy limits, the court denied motions without giving reasons.  There is some question as to under which rule the motions should lie.  The miscarriage of justice is such that we do not pause to pursue that aspect, but consider the substance briefly, if only to make it clear that the court's incorrect decision is not law of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In plaintiffs' amended complaint it was alleged that the liability insurer is liable \"up to its policy limits.\"   In a joint answer filed on behalf of Ashford and CIS it was alleged that plaintiffs' claims against Ashford \"exceed the coverage limits provided by\" CIS to Ashford.

The first game before us is found in plaintiffs' brief.  \"Before the instructions were read by the trial judge to the jury all parties stipulated to the court that '... if there is a judgment for or against the hospital the court will enter a similar judgment against the insurance company, Corporacion Insular de Seguros.'  (TT-A 1074).\"   When we check the cite we discover that the period appearing in their brief after \"de Seguros\" is plaintiffs'.  In the transcript it is a comma, followed by the modification, \"in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy.\"   One does not have to look to the familiar principle that all words are presumed to have meaning to recognize that there is a difference between liable and liable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy.  On reading the transcript further, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">quoted</span> supra</span>, we find that the phrase plaintiffs chose to omit in the brief, cut off by their false period, was precisely intended as a paraphrase of \"to the limit of the policy.\"   We are astonished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There follow a number of other contentions.  These not only do not answer the above, but they are equally unpersuasive in themselves.  We give one example:  CIS allegedly waived the policy limit by not listing it in the pretrial memorandum under Contested Issues.  It was not a contested issue.  Plaintiffs admitted in the amended complaint that they were not claiming above any limit;  defendant's answer asserted there was a limit;  plaintiffs had seen the policies, and knew what it was.  Now they say it was waived.  These are the plaintiffs who charge that defendant CIS's attempt to assert the policy limits is \"misleading double talk.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdicts and judgments are vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
