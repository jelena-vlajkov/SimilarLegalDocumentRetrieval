Appellant  Jose Miguel  Cruz appeals  the\r                            \r\n\nrefusal by  the district  court to depart  downward from  the\r\n\napplicable guideline when  it sentenced Cruz to  70 months in\r\n\nprison after he pled  guilty to conspiracy to a  drug charge.\r\n\nCruz raises two claims on  appeal.  After carefully reviewing\r\n\nthe record in this case, we affirm.\r\n\n     Cruz's  first claim is that  the district court erred in\r\n\nholding  that  it  was  without  authority  to grant  Cruz  a\r\n\ndownward departure based on his substantial assistance to the\r\n\ngovernment.  The government  did not move for a  departure in\r\n\nthis  case.  The district court properly held that, since the\r\n\ngovernment  did  not move  for  a  departure for  assistance,\r\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G.   5K1.1, the court was without authority\r\n\nto depart on  that basis.  United States v.  Romolo, 937 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n20, 23 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n\n     Cruz says that he sought his departure under the general\r\n\ndeparture provisions of section 5K2.0.   This court has  said\r\n\nin   Romolo  that  it  was  \"theoretically  possible,  albeit\r                       \r\n\nunlikely\" that  a substantial  assistance departure could  be\r\n\nbased on  the latter  section and granted  without government\r                                                              \r\n\nconsent.  Id. at 25.   But having reviewed the record in this\r                        \r\n\ncase,  we  think  that  there  is  nothing  even  arguably so\r\n\nextraordinary  as to take this  case out of  the general rule\r\n\nthat a motion by the government is required for a substantial\r\n\nassistance departure.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n     Cruz's  second  claim   is  that   the  district   court\r\n\nerroneously believed  that it was without  authority to grant\r\n\nhim  a downward  departure  based on  the allegedly  \"unusual\r\n\ncircumstances\"  of his  case, such  as his  rehabilitation in\r\n\nprison,  the   collateral   consequences  of   his   probable\r\n\ndeportation, and his assistance in persuading a fellow inmate\r\n\nto cooperate  with the government.   However, considering the\r\n\ncontext of  the  sentencing hearing  as a  whole, see  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Morrison, 46 F.3d 127, 130-131 (1st Cir. 1995), we\r                               \r\n\nare convinced that the court understood that it possessed the\r\n\nauthority to depart  on these grounds in an  appropriate case\r\n\nbut found  the facts peculiar  to Cruz not  so unusual  as to\r\n\njustify a downward departure.  Such a judgment, supported  by\r\n\nthe record in this case, is not reviewable on appeal.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Pierro, 32 F.2d  611, 619 (1st  Cir. 1994); United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.
