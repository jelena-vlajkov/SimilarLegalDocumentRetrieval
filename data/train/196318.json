Plaintiff-appellant Juan Ramon  Matta\r                                \r\n\nBallesteros  (\"Matta\"),  appeals  pro  se  from the  district\r                                                     \r\n\ncourt's dismissal  of his action  \"with prejudice\"  following\r\n\nhis Notice of Voluntary Dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\n41(a)(1)(i).     We  vacate  the  district  court's  judgment\r\n\ndismissing   the  case   with  prejudice   and  remand   with\r\n\ninstructions to dismiss the case without prejudice.\r\n\n     I. Timeliness of Appeal\r                                        \r\n\n     Defendants-appellees, the  United States of  America, et\r\n\nal.,  argue  that Matta's  appeal is  untimely and  should be\r\n\ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  We disagree.  In a civil\r\n\ncase such as this in which the United States or an officer or\r\n\nagency thereof is a party,  a notice of appeal must  be filed\r\n\nwithin sixty days after entry  of the judgment appealed from.\r\n\nSee Fed. R.  App. P. 4(a)(1).   A timely  motion pursuant  to\r               \r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) tolls the running of the appeal period.\r\n\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).  \"The timeliness of a Rule 59(e)\r               \r\n\nmotion is determined by the date of service, not the date  of\r\n\nfiling.\" Air Line Pilots  Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 26 F.3d 220, 223 n.3 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                \r\n\n     The district court judgment dismissing Matta's case with\r\n\nprejudice was entered on September 8, 1994.  Matta served his\r\n\nmotion  to reconsider by mail on September 13, 1994. See Fed.\r                                                                    \r\n\nR. Civ. P. 5(b)  (service by mail is complete  upon mailing).\r\n\nTherefore,  service of the motion  occurred within 10 days of\r\r\n\nthe entry of the district court's judgment and the motion was\r\n\ntimely. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).  Given  the timely  filing\r                       \r\n\nof Matta's motion to  reconsider, the sixty-day appeal period\r\n\nbegan  to run  on November 21,  1994, the  date on  which the\r\n\ndistrict court's  denial of  the motion  was entered.   Matta\r\n\nfiled his notice  of appeal on  December 5,  1994, and it  is\r\n\ntherefore timely with  respect to both  the dismissal of  his\r\n\ncase and the denial of his motion to reconsider. Accordingly,\r\n\nthis court has jurisdiction to consider Matta's appeal.\r\n\n     II. Dismissal with Prejudice\r                                             \r\n\n     Matta argues that the  district court violated the clear\r\n\nmeaning  of Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 41(a)(1)(i)  in dismissing  his\r\n\ncomplaint  \"with prejudice\"  instead  of  without  prejudice.\r\n\nRule 41(a)(1)(i) provides, in relevant part, as follows:\r\n\n     an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without\r\n     order  of court (i) by filing a notice of dismissal\r\n     at any time  before service by the adverse party of\r                                                                    \r\n     an  answer or of a motion for summary judgment, . .\r                                                               \r\n     .  .  Unless  otherwise  stated in  the  notice  of\r\n     dismissal  or stipulation, the dismissal is without\r                                                                    \r\n     prejudice, . . . .\r                          \r\n\n(emphasis added).  \r\n\n     Matta  filed a Notice  of Dismissal pursuant  to Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv.  P. 41(a)(1)(i)  on  August 30,  1994.   At  that  time,\r\n\ndefendants had filed a motion to dismiss (on August 4, 1994).\r\n\nDefendants had  not filed, however,  either an answer  to the\r\n\ncomplaint or a motion for summary judgment.   Therefore, \"the\r\n\nplaintiff had the  right voluntarily to  dismiss the case  at\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nany  time before an answer  or a motion  for summary judgment\r\n\nwas served.  The plaintiff  properly invoked that  right, and\r\n\nthe district court had no  power to condition its dismissal.\"\r\n\nUniversidad  Central del  Caribe,  Inc. v.
