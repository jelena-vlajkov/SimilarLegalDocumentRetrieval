The   defendants,   John   Treddin,  a\r                             \r\n\ndisciplinary  hearing  officer at  Massachusetts Correctional\r\n\nInstitute  - Cedar  Junction (MCI-CJ)  and Ronald  Duval, the\r\n\nsuperintendent at  MCI-CJ, appeal the grant  of a declaratory\r\n\njudgment in  favor of inmate Brendan  McGuinness.  McGuinness\r\n\ncross-appeals the grant of summary judgment on the  ground of\r\n\nqualified  immunity in favor of  the defendants on his claims\r\n\nfor damages.  We reverse the declaratory judgment in favor of\r\n\nMcGuinness  and affirm  the summary  judgment on  the damages\r\n\nclaims.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     In  November 1991,  McGuinness got  into  an altercation\r\n\nwith a  prison guard, Sergeant John Andrade,  and was charged\r\n\nwith  various prison disciplinary  code violations, including\r\n\nbeing  out  of  place,  disrupting the  security  or  orderly\r\n\nrunning  of  the institution,  fighting  and  use of  abusive\r\n\nlanguage.  A  few days  later, McGuinness was  notified of  a\r\n\ndisciplinary  hearing  and   moved  to  MCI-CJ's   West  Wing\r\n\nSegregation  Unit (\"West Wing\").1  He was placed in the upper\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  West Wing  is comprised  of two  sections.   The two\r\nupper  tiers are  denominated as  the \"Awaiting  Action Unit\"\r\n(\"AAU\").   The AAU is  a secure  holding area  for an  inmate\r\nwhile he is awaiting a disciplinary hearing.  The lower tiers\r\nof  the  West  Wing  are the  Departmental  Segregation  Unit\r\n(\"DSU\").  According to  prison regulations, an inmate may  be\r\nplaced in the DSU only after a finding by the Commissioner of\r\nCorrection  (or his designee)  based on  substantial evidence\r\nthat, if confined in the general population, the inmate poses\r\na substantial threat  (i) to  the safety of  others, (ii)  of\r\ndamaging or destroying property, or (iii) to the operation of\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ntier  of  the  West Wing,  i.e.,  in  the  AAU.   McGuinness'\r\n\ndisciplinary  hearing was held in the West Wing on January 9,\r\n\n1992.   Both  McGuinness  and Andrade  testified and  Andrade\r\n\nsubmitted his  written report.   McGuinness admitted  that he\r\n\nargued with,  used foul language toward,  and struck Andrade,\r\n\nbut claimed  that he was  provoked when  Andrade pushed  him.\r\n\nAndrade  acknowledged that  he  pushed  McGuinness away  when\r\n\nMcGuinness  got right up in his face.  McGuinness' request to\r\n\ncall three inmate witnesses from the general population, (who\r\n\nhe  alleged  were  eyewitnesses),  was  denied  \"for security\r\n\nreasons.\"   However, Officer Treddin considered their written\r\n\naffidavits.   Ultimately, Treddin deemed the three affidavits\r\n\n\"non-credible\" because in Treddin's opinion all three inmates\r\n\nsaw the confrontation only in part.  Treddin found McGuinness\r\n\nguilty  based  on McGuinness'  own  admissions  and Andrade's\r\n\nwritten report and  testimony.  Treddin imposed a sanction of\r\n\n30 days in isolation and recommended that McGuinness lose 100\r\n\ndays of good-time credit.\r\n\n     McGuinness    appealed    the   matter    to   defendant\r\n\nSuperintendent  Duval,  claiming,  inter  alia,  that Treddin\r\n\nwrongfully   portrayed  McGuinness   as  the   aggressor  and\r\n\nwrongfully   denied   his  request   for  witnesses   due  to\r\n\nMcGuinness' placement in the  West Wing.  He argued  that his\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nthe correctional  facility.   Mass.  Reg.  Code tit.  103,   \r\n421.09 (1990).\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nwitnesses \"would have been able to explain what they saw much\r\n\nbetter if given a chance  to give an oral testimony.\"   Duval\r\n\ndenied  McGuinness' appeal.    Eventually, the  incident  was\r\n\nreferred to the DSU  board and, pursuant to a  finding, based\r\n\non this November  1991 incident and a  subsequent incident or\r\n\nincidents  in  January  1992,  that  McGuinness  presented  a\r\n\nsubstantial  threat  to  the  safety  of  others,  McGuinness\r\n\nreceived  a two year sentence  of confinement to  the DSU (in\r\n\naddition to the sanction of 30 days in  isolation and loss of\r\n\n100 days of good-time credit).\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     In  November 1993,  McGuinness  filed an  action in  the\r\n\ndistrict court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.   1983, naming  Officer\r\n\nTreddin and  Superintendent Duval  as defendants (as  well as\r\n\nother  prison  officials not  pertinent  here).   McGuinness'\r\n\ncomplaint  raised  several  claims,  most of  which  are  not\r\n\ninvolved  in these  cross-appeals.   The counts  which remain\r\n\nrelevant  are these:  Count 2  alleged that  Treddin violated\r\n\nMcGuinness' right to due  process.  In particular, McGuinness\r\n\nalleged that he  had been unlawfully transferred to  the West\r\n\nWing prior to any  guilty finding and that Treddin  used this\r\n\nalleged illegal placement in the West Wing as the sole reason\r\n\nfor  denying his request for witnesses.  Count 4 alleged that\r\n\nSuperintendent  Duval  violated   McGuinness'  right  to  due\r\n\nprocess  by  denying  his  appeal  without  any  explanation.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nMcGuinness  asked  for compensatory  and punitive  damages on\r\n\nthese  claims.  In Count 6 McGuinness requested a declaratory\r\n\njudgment  that his placement in the West Wing was illegal and\r\n\nthe denial  of witnesses due to his  placement there violated\r\n\ndue process.\r\n\n     The  parties cross-moved  for  summary judgment.   In  a\r\n\nmemorandum  and order,  dated  March 15,  1995, the  district\r\n\ncourt concluded that genuine  issues of material fact existed\r\n\nas  to   whether  (a)   McGuinness'  placement  in   the  AAU\r\n\nconstituted an unlawful placement in a segregation unit prior\r\n\nto a  guilty finding,  the imposition of  sanctions, and  the\r\n\nappropriate   finding   of   \"substantial  threat\"   by   the\r\n\nCommissioner; and  (b) Treddin's refusal to  allow McGuinness\r\n\nto  call   witnesses  violated   \"the  rule  of   Kenney  [v.\r                                                                    \r\n\nCommissioner  of  Correction, 393  Mass.  28  (1984)].\"   The\r                                        \r\n\ncourt,  therefore, declined to  enter a declaratory judgment,\r\n\nas requested in Count 6, in any party's favor.  The court did\r\n\nconclude,  however, that the state  of the law  on this issue\r\n\nwas confused and,  thus, Treddin and  Duval were entitled  to\r\n\nsummary  judgment  on the  ground  of  qualified immunity  on\r\n\nMcGuinness' damages claims  -- Count 2 (Treddin)  and Count 4\r\n\n(Duval).2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The district court  construed Count 4 as  a claim against\r\nDuval, not on the  basis of respondeat superior  (which would\r\nnot lie,  pursuant to   1983,  in any event), but  as a claim\r\nthat Duval was personally liable for failing to take remedial\r\naction after  learning of  the alleged due  process violation\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     Count  6 then  went to  a one-day  bench trial  at which\r\n\nOfficer  Treddin testified.  The court's findings of fact and\r\n\nrulings of law  can be found at McGuinness v.  Dubois, 887 F.\r                                                                 \r\n\nSupp. 20,  21-23 (D. Mass. 1995).   In brief, the court ruled\r\n\nthat  the  AAU  is  not  a DSU.    Thus,  the  court rejected\r\n\nMcGuinness' initial premise, i.e.,  that his placement in the\r\n\nAAU constituted an unlawful placement in the DSU prior to the\r\n\nrequired  findings  by the  Commissioner.    Nonetheless, the\r\n\ncourt  held that  McGuinness was  \"not given  the protections\r\n\nafforded  him by  Department  of Correction  regulations\"  as\r\n\ninterpreted  by Kenney  and  subsequent caselaw.   The  court\r                                  \r\n\ndeclared that  Treddin's determination must be  set aside and\r\n\nthat the  rulings that followed the  disciplinary hearing are\r\n\nvoid and  of no effect and may play no part whatsoever in any\r\n\nfurther  classification,  penal,  disciplinary,   or  release\r\n\ndecisions with respect to McGuinness.\r\n\n     As  noted at the  outset, Treddin and  Duval appeal this\r\n\ndeclaratory judgment  and McGuinness cross-appeals  the March\r\n\n15 summary judgment denying his claims for damages.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n     In Wolff  v. McDonnell, 418  U.S. 539 (1974),  the Court\r                                       \r\n\nheld  that  a state-created  right  to  good-time credit  for\r\n\nsatisfactory   behavior,   forfeitable   only   for   serious\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nthrough   McGuinness'   appeal  following   the  disciplinary\r\nhearing.   Thus  construed, the  district court  found Duval,\r\nnonetheless, entitled to qualified immunity.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nmisbehavior,  is  a sufficient  liberty  interest  within the\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment to entitle  the inmate to \"those minimum\r\n\nprocedures appropriate  under the circumstances  and required\r\n\nby the Due  Process Clause to  insure that the  state-created\r\n\nright  is not  arbitrarily  abrogated.\"   Id.  at 557.3    In\r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Recently, the Court, in Sandin v. Conner, 115 S. Ct. 2293\r                                                        \r\n(1995),  refocused  the due  process  inquiry  away from  the\r\nparsing  of  the mandatory/discretionary  language  in prison\r\nregulations and back to the  nature of the deprivation, i.e.,\r\nwhether  the  restraint  \"imposes  atypical  and  significant\r\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary  incidents\r\nof prison  life\" or \"will  inevitably affect the  duration of\r\nhis  sentence.\"   Id.  at 2299-302.    In Sandin,  the  Court\r                                                            \r\nconcluded that solitary confinement  did not present the type\r\nof atypical,  significant deprivation in which  a state might\r\nconceivably create a liberty interest.  Id. at 2301.  Nor did\r                                                       \r\nit inevitably affect  the duration of Conner's sentence.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\nat 2302.\r\n     Sandin, however,  did not  retreat from Wolff's  holding\r                                                              \r\nthat,  if  a  state  statutory provision  created  a  liberty\r\ninterest in  a shortened  prison sentence which  results from\r                                                     \r\ngood-time credits, revocable only if  the inmate is guilty of\r\nserious misconduct, that inmate is entitled to the procedural\r\nprotections outlined in Wolff.  Id. at 2297; see also Gotcher\r                                                                         \r\nv. Wood, 66  F.3d 1097,  1110 (9th Cir.  1995) (opining  that\r                   \r\nWolff's  due process  principles  remain  applicable  in  the\r                 \r\ncontext  of revocation of  statutory good-time  credits after\r\nSandin).\r                  \r\n     Massachusetts has  a statutory provision,  Mass. Gen. L.\r\nch. 127,    129, awarding  a good conduct  deduction from  an\r\ninmate's   maximum   imprisonment   term,   forfeitable   for\r\nviolations of prison rules.   And, in the instant  case, as a\r\nresult  of the  guilty  finding on  the disciplinary  charge,\r\nMcGuinness forfeited  100  days of  good-time.    McGuinness,\r\ntherefore, was entitled to  the procedural protections of the\r\nDue Process Clause  prior to the revocation  of his statutory\r\ngood-time  credits.  (Although Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  127,   129\r\nwas repealed on  July 1, 1994,  the repealing provision  also\r\nprovided that the  law in  effect at the  time an offense  is\r\ncommitted  governs  sentencing  for that  offense,  i.e., the\r\nrepealed  section still applies  to McGuinness, whose offense\r\nwas committed prior to July 1, 1994.)\r\n     As  explained in  greater  detail, infra,  the issue  in\r                                                         \r\nthese  appeals  is what  process  was due  McGuinness  at his\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nWolff, the Court determined  that, at a minimum,  due process\r                 \r\n\nentitled  an inmate,  facing a  disciplinary hearing,  to (1)\r\n\nadvance (no less than 24 hours) written notice of the claimed\r\n\nviolation,  (2)  a  qualified  right to  call  witnesses  and\r\n\npresent documentary evidence in  his defense when  permitting\r\n\nhim  to do so will  not be unduly  hazardous to institutional\r\n\nsafety or correctional  goals, and (3) a written statement of\r\n\nthe  factfinders  as  to  the evidence  relied  upon  and the\r\n\nreasons for the disciplinary action taken.  Id. at 563-67.\r                                                           \r\n\n     These  cross-appeals concern  the  second of  these  due\r\n\nprocess  requirements  --  the  parameters  of  the  inmate's\r\n\nqualified right to call witnesses.  The district court found,\r\n\nand  the  defendants  do  not  dispute,  that  MCI-CJ  has an\r\n\ninstitutional policy  of denying an inmate's  request to call\r\n\ninmate   witnesses   from  the   general   population   at  a\r\n\ndisciplinary  hearing held in the West Wing.4  This policy is\r\n\nbased  on the  heightened security  requirements in  the West\r\n\nWing, which houses inmates with a demonstrated proclivity for\r\n\nviolence  and disruption,  and on  the resulting  effect that\r\n\nbringing witnesses into  the West Wing has on  the allocation\r\n\nof  corrections officers there and in the rest of the prison.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ndisciplinary hearing under federal constitutional law.\r                                              \r\n\n4.  The court also found, however, that there were occasions,\r\nalthough  rare,  when  a disciplinary  hearing  involving  an\r\ninmate  housed in the West  Wing had been  moved outside that\r\nwing.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nAny inmate entering the West Wing from the general population\r\n\nhas to  be strip-searched  and accompanied by  two correction\r\n\nofficers; restraints are required  to move inmates within the\r\n\nWest Wing; and  restraints may, or  may not, be  used in  the\r\n\npresence of hearing officers at disciplinary hearings.\r\n\n     The court held that the Kenney decision, i.e., \"the rule\r                                               \r\n\nof Kenney,\"  and subsequent  caselaw prohibits the  denial of\r                     \r\n\nwitnesses' testimony simply based  on an inmate's location in\r\n\nthe West Wing and that the caselaw and the prison regulations\r\n\nrequire   an   individualized  assessment   that   calling  a\r\n\nparticular witness would be unduly hazardous to institutional\r\n\nsafety  or  correctional goals.    The  court found  that  no\r\n\nindividualized  assessment occurred  in McGuinness'  case and\r\n\nthus McGuinness was not given the protections afforded him by\r\n\nthe regulations as interpreted by Kenney and its progeny.\r                                                    \r\n\n     To  a  large  extent,  however,  Kenney  was  simply  an\r                                                        \r\n\ninterpretation of the requirements of state law.   In Kenney,\r                                                                        \r\n\ninmate  Kenney had been transferred  to the DSU  prior to his\r                                                           \r\n\ndisciplinary hearing  on assault  charges and confined  there\r\n\nunder the same conditions as those inmates transferred to the\r\n\nDSU  pursuant to  a finding  by the  Commissioner that  their\r\n\nbehavior  posed  a  substantial  threat   to  the  residents,\r\n\nproperty,  or  operations  of  the institution.

Kenney  subsequently\r\n\nbrought an action in state court  and on appeal the SJC found\r\n\nthat the prison officials had violated their own regulations,\r\n\nwhich have the force of state law, by placing Kenney in a DSU\r\n\ncell for committing a  disciplinary offense before Kenney had\r\n\nbeen  found guilty,  before sanctions  had been  imposed, and\r\n\nbefore  the  Commissioner  had  found  that  Kenney  posed  a\r\n\nsubstantial threat to  the institution.

And, in each  case cited, including\r\nBartholomew,   the   across-the-board  prohibition   extended\r                                                                         \r\nprison-wide   in   an   undifferentiated   fashion   to   all\r                       \r\ndisciplinary hearings.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nthe  policy  is reasonably  based  on  legitimate penological\r\n\ninterests and is not an exaggerated response).\r\n\n     Although some particular case  in the future may present\r\n\ncompelling  evidence  that MCI-CJ's  policy  of denying  live\r\n\ntestimony  from inmate  witnesses at  a  disciplinary hearing\r\n\nheld  in  the  West  Wing  violates  due  process,  we  leave\r\n\nconsideration of such  a case where  it appears presently  to\r\n\nreside --  in the future.  We find that, on the facts of this\r\n\ncase,  the  district  court  erred  in  concluding  that  the\r\n\napplication of  this policy to McGuinness  violated his right\r\n\nto due  process.   McGuinness contends that  he was  provoked\r\n\ninto  striking Andrade  and  that should  lessen any  penalty\r\n\nimposed.   McGuinness concedes  that, contrary to  the prison\r\n\nrules, he did not inform Officer Treddin in advance about the\r\n\ncontent  of the expected testimony of  Justin Holmes and Jack\r\n\nShea,  other  than   characterizing  them  as   eyewitnesses.\r\n\nNonetheless,  Treddin obtained  their affidavits,  along with\r\n\nthe  affidavit  of  a   third  inmate,  Michael  Dowd,  whose\r\n\ntestimony McGuinness had not  previously requested.   Treddin\r\n\nconcluded  that none of the three saw the whole confrontation\r\n\n- a factual determination  certainly within his discretion to\r\n\nmake  and not within a  court's competency to  overturn.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nSuperintendent,  Mass. Correctional Inst.,  Walpole, v.

He  has  never\r\n\nsuggested what  their live testimony would  have added, other\r\n\nthan that they would have been able to \"explain what they saw\r\n\nmuch  better.\"8     The  live  testimony   of  the  requested\r\n\nwitnesses was  denied on the  basis of a  policy --  the bona\r\n\nfides of which  have not  been challenged here  -- rooted  in\r\n\nlegitimate   institutional  security  concerns.     In  these\r\n\ncircumstances, the defendants  have carried  their burden  of\r\n\nproving  that  the  denial  of  live  testimony  was  neither\r\n\narbitrary  nor  capricious,  see  Smith  v.  Mass.  Dept.  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorrection,  936 F.2d  1390, 1399  (1st Cir. 1991),  and that\r                      \r\n\nTreddin did  not clearly  abuse his considerable  discretion,\r\n\nsee Hurney v.

And, it is not certain that even this suggestion was made\r\nat the  disciplinary hearing  so that Treddin  could consider\r\nit.

McGuinness cross-appeals the grant of summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity in favor of the defendants on his claims for damages.   We reverse the declaratory judgment in favor of McGuinness and affirm the summary judgment on the damages claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1991, McGuinness got into an altercation with a prison guard, Sergeant John Andrade, and was charged with various prison disciplinary code violations, including being out of place, disrupting the security or orderly running of the institution, fighting and use of abusive language.   A few days later, McGuinness was notified of a disciplinary hearing and moved to MCI-CJ's West Wing Segregation Unit (\"West Wing\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He was placed in the upper tier of the West Wing, i.e., in the AAU.   McGuinness' disciplinary hearing was held in the West Wing on January 9, 1992.   Both McGuinness and Andrade testified and Andrade submitted his written report.   McGuinness admitted that he argued with, used foul language toward, and struck Andrade, but claimed that he was provoked when Andrade pushed him.   Andrade acknowledged that he pushed McGuinness away when McGuinness got right up in his face.   McGuinness' request to call three inmate witnesses from the general population, (who he alleged were eyewitnesses), was denied \"for security reasons.\"   However, Officer Treddin considered their written affidavits.   Ultimately, Treddin deemed the three affidavits \"non-credible\" because in Treddin's opinion all three inmates saw the confrontation only in part.   Treddin found McGuinness guilty based on McGuinness' own admissions and Andrade's written report and testimony.   Treddin imposed a sanction of 30 days in isolation and recommended that McGuinness lose 100 days of good-time credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGuinness appealed the matter to defendant Superintendent Duval, claiming, inter alia, that Treddin wrongfully portrayed McGuinness as the aggressor and wrongfully denied his request for witnesses due to McGuinness' placement in the West Wing.   He argued that his witnesses \"would have been able to explain what they saw much better if given a chance to give an oral testimony.\"   Duval denied McGuinness' appeal.   Eventually, the incident was referred to the DSU board and, pursuant to a finding, based on this November 1991 incident and a subsequent incident or incidents in January 1992, that McGuinness presented a substantial threat to the safety of others, McGuinness received a two year sentence of confinement to the DSU (in addition to the sanction of 30 days in isolation and loss of 100 days of good-time credit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1993, McGuinness filed an action in the district court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, naming Officer Treddin and Superintendent Duval as defendants (as well as other prison officials not pertinent here).   McGuinness' complaint raised several claims, most of which are not involved in these cross-appeals.   The counts which remain relevant are these:  Count 2 alleged that Treddin violated McGuinness' right to due process.   In particular, McGuinness alleged that he had been unlawfully transferred to the West Wing prior to any guilty finding and that Treddin used this alleged illegal placement in the West Wing as the sole reason for denying his request for witnesses.   Count 4 alleged that Superintendent Duval violated McGuinness' right to due process by denying his appeal without any explanation.   McGuinness asked for compensatory and punitive damages on these claims.   In Count 6 McGuinness requested a declaratory judgment that his placement in the West Wing was illegal and the denial of witnesses due to his placement there violated due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties cross-moved for summary judgment.   In a memorandum and order, dated March 15, 1995, the district court concluded that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether (a) McGuinness' placement in the AAU constituted an unlawful placement in a segregation unit prior to a guilty finding, the imposition of sanctions, and the appropriate finding of \"substantial threat\" by the Commissioner;  and (b) Treddin's refusal to allow McGuinness to call witnesses violated \"the rule of Kenney [v. Commissioner of Correction, 393 Mass. 28, 468 N.E.2d 616 (1984) ].\"  The court, therefore, declined to enter a declaratory judgment, as requested in Count 6, in any party's favor. The court did conclude, however, that the state of the law on this issue was confused and, thus, Treddin and Duval were entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity on McGuinness' damages claims--Count 2 (Treddin) and Count 4 (Duval).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 6 then went to a one-day bench trial at which Officer Treddin testified.   The court's findings of fact and rulings of law can be found at McGuinness v. Dubois, 887 F.Supp. 20, 21-23 (D.Mass.1995).   In brief, the court ruled that the AAU is not a DSU.   Thus, the court rejected McGuinness' initial premise, i.e., that his placement in the AAU constituted an unlawful placement in the DSU prior to the required findings by the Commissioner.   Nonetheless, the court held that McGuinness was \"not given the protections afforded him by Department of Correction regulations\" as interpreted by Kenney and subsequent caselaw.   The court declared that Treddin's determination must be set aside and that the rulings that followed the disciplinary hearing are void and of no effect and may play no part whatsoever in any further classification, penal, disciplinary, or release decisions with respect to McGuinness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted at the outset, Treddin and Duval appeal this declaratory judgment and McGuinness cross-appeals the March 15 summary judgment denying his claims for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), the Court held that a state-created right to good-time credit for satisfactory behavior, forfeitable only for serious misbehavior, is a sufficient liberty interest within the Fourteenth Amendment to entitle the inmate to \"those minimum procedures appropriate under the circumstances and required by the Due Process Clause to insure that the state-created right is not arbitrarily abrogated.\"  Id. at 557, 94 S.Ct. at 2975.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In Wolff, the Court determined that, at a minimum, due process entitled an inmate, facing a disciplinary hearing, to (1) advance (no less than 24 hours) written notice of the claimed violation, (2) a qualified right to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense when permitting him to do so will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals, and (3) a written statement of the factfinders as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken.  Id. at 563-67, 94 S.Ct. at 2978-80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cross-appeals concern the second of these due process requirements--the parameters of the inmate's qualified right to call witnesses.   The district court found, and the defendants do not dispute, that MCI-CJ has an institutional policy of denying an inmate's request to call inmate witnesses from the general population at a disciplinary hearing held in the West Wing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  This policy is based on the heightened security requirements in the West Wing, which houses inmates with a demonstrated proclivity for violence and disruption, and on the resulting effect that bringing witnesses into the West Wing has on the allocation of corrections officers there and in the rest of the prison.   Any inmate entering the West Wing from the general population has to be strip-searched and accompanied by two correction officers;  restraints are required to move inmates within the West Wing;  and restraints may, or may not, be used in the presence of hearing officers at disciplinary hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held that the Kenney decision, i.e., \"the rule of Kenney,\" and subsequent caselaw prohibits the denial of witnesses' testimony simply based on an inmate's location in the West Wing and that the caselaw and the prison regulations require an individualized assessment that calling a particular witness would be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.   The court found that no individualized assessment occurred in McGuinness' case and thus McGuinness was not given the protections afforded him by the regulations as interpreted by Kenney and its progeny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To a large extent, however, Kenney was simply an interpretation of the requirements of state law.   In Kenney, inmate Kenney had been transferred to the DSU prior to his disciplinary hearing on assault charges and confined there under the same conditions as those inmates transferred to the DSU pursuant to a finding by the Commissioner that their behavior posed a substantial threat to the residents, property, or operations of the institution.  Kenney v. Commissioner of Correction, 393 Mass. at 29, 468 N.E.2d 616.   At his disciplinary hearing, Kenney's request that the two alleged victims (both inmates in the general population) be allowed to appear as witnesses was denied.   Kenney subsequently brought an action in state court and on appeal the SJC found that the prison officials had violated their own regulations, which have the force of state law, by placing Kenney in a DSU cell for committing a disciplinary offense before Kenney had been found guilty, before sanctions had been imposed, and before the Commissioner had found that Kenney posed a substantial threat to the institution.  Id. at 33-34, 468 N.E.2d 616.   As Kenney was illegally incarcerated in the DSU, the court rejected the prison officials' attempt to justify their denial of his request to call witnesses on basis of his location in the DSU.  Id. at 35, 468 N.E.2d 616.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that \"the rule of Kenney \" is solely a rule of state law, it has no application in this &#167; 1983 action claiming a deprivation of McGuinness' rights secured by the federal Constitution and laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  \"Federal constitutional standards rather than state statutes define the requirements of procedural due process.\"  Russell v. Selsky, 35 F.3d 55, 60 (2d Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \"The failure of the [disciplinary] board to comply with its own regulation would constitute a denial of due process if the regulation were mandated by the Constitution or federal law.\"  Domegan v. Fair, 603 F.Supp. 360, 364 (D.Mass.1985);  see also Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 250-51, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 1748-49, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983) (\"The State may choose to require procedures for reasons other than protection against deprivation of substantive rights, of course, but in making that choice the State does not create an independent substantive right.\")  (Footnote omitted).  \"The rule of Kenney,\" therefore, is relevant to McGuinness' &#167; 1983 action only to the extent that Kenney accurately recites the parameters of federal due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC did consider whether Kenney's due process rights were violated by the denial of his request to call certain witnesses.  Kenney v. Commissioner of Correction, 393 Mass. at 34, 468 N.E.2d 616.   But that determination was based on its conclusion that due process requires some support in the administrative record to justify the denial and none was found in Kenney's case.  Id. at 35, 468 N.E.2d 616, citing Real v. Superintendent, Mass.  Correctional Inst., Walpole, 390 Mass. 399, 407, 456 N.E.2d 1111 (1983).   However, the Supreme Court has since held that due process does not require that support for the denial of witnesses exist as part of the administrative record;  rather prison officials may satisfy due process by presenting testimony in court if the deprivation of a liberty interest is challenged because of that claimed defect in the hearing.  Ponte v. Real, 471 U.S. 491, 496-97, 105 S.Ct. 2192, 2195-96, 85 L.Ed.2d 553 (1985), vacating and remanding, Real v. Superintendent, Mass.  Correctional Inst., Walpole, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as Kenney speaks to the commands of due process, therefore, we disagree with the district court's conclusion that, \"properly interpreted,\" Kenney stands for the proposition that \"witnesses cannot be denied in a disciplinary hearing simply based upon the location of the individual within the prison.\"  McGuinness v. Dubois, 887 F.Supp. at 22.   Further, of import is the Kenney court's treatment of Devaney v. Hall, 509 F.Supp. 497 (D.Mass.1981).   In Devaney, the district court held that the \"across-the-board\" policy of MCI-CJ [then called MCI-Walpole] of permitting only written statements of witnesses in disciplinary hearings held in the DSU [then called Block 10] did not violate due process as it was not arbitrary nor beyond the discretion of prison authorities to adopt.  Id. at 500-01.   In Kenney, the SJC distinguished Devaney on the ground that, unlike Devaney, Kenney was not lawfully held in the DSU and reliance on his location as a justification for the denial of witnesses was therefore unreasonable.  Kenney v. Commissioner of Correction, 393 Mass. at 35 n. 11, 468 N.E.2d 616.   If, \"properly interpreted,\" Kenney stands for the proposition that witnesses cannot be denied in a disciplinary hearing simply based upon the location of the individual within the prison, whether lawfully confined in that area or not, then the SJC would not have distinguished Devaney;  rather, the SJC would have expressed disagreement with Devaney 's holding.   But the SJC did not do that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we disagree with the district court's interpretation of \"the rule of Kenney,\" insofar as the district court interprets that rule as speaking to the requirements of federal due process,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> we note that to prohibit live defense witness testimony at a disciplinary hearing, numerous courts have interpreted the due process teachings of the Wolff opinion to require an individualized decision, based on the facts of each case.   See, e.g., Mitchell v. Dupnik, 67 F.3d 216, 223 (9th Cir.1995);  Forbes v. Trigg, 976 F.2d 308, 317 (7th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 950, 113 S.Ct. 1362, 122 L.Ed.2d 741 (1993);  Ramer v. Kerby, 936 F.2d 1102, 1104 (10th Cir.1991);  King v. Wells, 760 F.2d 89, 93 (6th Cir.1985);  Dalton v. Hutto, 713 F.2d 75, 78 (4th Cir.1983);  Bartholomew v. Watson, 665 F.2d 915, 918 (9th Cir.1982)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>;  but see Powell v. Coughlin, 953 F.2d 744, 749 (2d Cir.1991).   The Supreme Court, itself, has addressed the validity of an \"across-the-board\" policy denying witness requests only indirectly.   While, in Ponte, it disagreed with the Massachusetts prison officials' contention that \" 'across-the-board' policies denying witness requests are invariably proper,\" Ponte v. Real, 471 U.S. at 496, 105 S.Ct. at 2195-96, as the Second Circuit has said, the Court \"has not ruled that such policies are invariably improper.\"  Powell v. Coughlin, 953 F.2d at 749 (holding that an across-the-board policy barring the testimony of mental health staff in an inmate's presence at prison disciplinary hearings does not violate due process as the policy is reasonably based on legitimate penological interests and is not an exaggerated response).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although some particular case in the future may present compelling evidence that MCI-CJ's policy of denying live testimony from inmate witnesses at a disciplinary hearing held in the West Wing violates due process, we leave consideration of such a case where it appears presently to reside--in the future.   We find that, on the facts of this case, the district court erred in concluding that the application of this policy to McGuinness violated his right to due process.   McGuinness contends that he was provoked into striking Andrade and that should lessen any penalty imposed.   McGuinness concedes that, contrary to the prison rules, he did not inform Officer Treddin in advance about the content of the expected testimony of Justin Holmes and Jack Shea, other than characterizing them as eyewitnesses.   Nonetheless, Treddin obtained their affidavits, along with the affidavit of a third inmate, Michael Dowd, whose testimony McGuinness had not previously requested.   Treddin concluded that none of the three saw the whole confrontation--a factual determination certainly within his discretion to make and not within a court's competency to overturn.   See Superintendent, Mass.  Correctional Inst., Walpole v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454-55, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 2773-74, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985) (holding that procedural due process is satisfied if the decision to revoke good-time credits is supported by \"some evidence\" in the record, which \"does [not] imply that a disciplinary's board's factual findings ... are subject to second-guessing upon review\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guilty finding was based on the undisputed facts that McGuinness was out of his cell, acting disruptive, and used abusive language and assaulted a staff member.   McGuinness was permitted to present his defense, supported by witness affidavits, that he was provoked.   He has never suggested what their live testimony would have added, other than that they would have been able to \"explain what they saw much better.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The live testimony of the requested witnesses was denied on the basis of a policy--the bona fides of which have not been challenged here--rooted in legitimate institutional security concerns.   In these circumstances, the defendants have carried their burden of proving that the denial of live testimony was neither arbitrary nor capricious, see Smith v. Mass.  Dept. of Correction, 936 F.2d 1390, 1399 (1st Cir.1991), and that Treddin did not clearly abuse his considerable discretion, see Hurney v. Carver, 602 F.2d 993, 995 (1st Cir.1979), in denying McGuinness' request for the live testimony of Holmes, Shea, and Dowd, even if the denial was based on a general policy of denying live witness testimony in the West Wing.  \"[S]o long as the reasons are logically related to preventing undue hazards to 'institutional safety or correctional goals,' the explanation should meet the due process requirements as outlined in Wolff.\"  Ponte v.

The two upper tiers are denominated as the \"Awaiting Action Unit\" (\"AAU\").   The AAU is a secure holding area for an inmate while he is awaiting a disciplinary hearing.   The lower tiers of the West Wing are the Departmental Segregation Unit (\"DSU\").   According to prison regulations, an inmate may be placed in the DSU only after a finding by the Commissioner of Correction (or his designee) based on substantial evidence that, if confined in the general population, the inmate poses a substantial threat (i) to the safety of others, (ii) of damaging or destroying property, or (iii) to the operation of the correctional facility.

Thus construed, the district court found Duval, nonetheless, entitled to qualified immunity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Recently, the Court, in Sandin v. Conner, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), refocused the due process inquiry away from the parsing of the mandatory/discretionary language in prison regulations and back to the nature of the deprivation, i.e., whether the restraint \"imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\" or \"will inevitably affect the duration of his sentence.\"  Id. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2299-302.   In Sandin, the Court concluded that solitary confinement did not present the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a state might conceivably create a liberty interest.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2301.   Nor did it inevitably affect the duration of Conner's sentence.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2302</p>\n        <p>Sandin, however, did not retreat from Wolff's holding that, if a state statutory provision created a liberty interest in a shortened prison sentence which results from good-time credits, revocable only if the inmate is guilty of serious misconduct, that inmate is entitled to the procedural protections outlined in Wolff.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2297;  see also Gotcher v. Wood, 66 F.3d 1097, 1101 (9th Cir.1995) (opining that Wolff's due process principles remain applicable in the context of revocation of statutory good-time credits after Sandin).</p>\n        <p>Massachusetts has a statutory provision, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 127, &#167; 129, awarding a good conduct deduction from an inmate's maximum imprisonment term, forfeitable for violations of prison rules.   And, in the instant case, as a result of the guilty finding on the disciplinary charge, McGuinness forfeited 100 days of good-time.   McGuinness, therefore, was entitled to the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause prior to the revocation of his statutory good-time credits.  (Although Mass.Gen.L. ch. 127, &#167; 129 was repealed on July 1, 1994, the repealing provision also provided that the law in effect at the time an offense is committed governs sentencing for that offense, i.e., the repealed section still applies to McGuinness, whose offense was committed prior to July 1, 1994.)</p>\n        <p>As explained in greater detail, infra, the issue in these appeals is what process was due McGuinness at his disciplinary hearing under federal constitutional law.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The court also found, however, that there were occasions, although rare, when a disciplinary hearing involving an inmate housed in the West Wing had been moved outside that wing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the prison officials arbitrarily violated their own state law regulations, it would appear that McGuinness could have pursued state judicial review.

Guyton was found to have been unlawfully held in the DSU and thus Guyton is simply a straightforward application of Kenney.   The Abrazinski court's discussion of Kenney was dicta and, in any event, for reasons discussed, supra, we disagree with that court's reading of Kenney as holding that \"isolation in a segregation unit alone, even if legal, is not sufficient to support a denial of witnesses.\"  Abrazinski v. DuBois, 876 F.Supp. at 323 (emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We note that while the Bartholomew opinion stated that a blanket proscription against calling certain types of witnesses violated the \"suggestion\" in Wolff that the decision to deny live witness testimony should be made on a case-by-case analysis of the potential hazards which may flow from the calling of a particular person, Bartholomew v. Watson, 665 F.2d at 918, later cases, in citing Bartholomew, have, without comment, transformed this characterization of Wolff's \"suggestion\" into a requirement.   See, e.g., Mitchell v. Dupnik, 67 F.3d at 223</p>\n        <p>We also note that, apart from Bartholomew, all of the above-mentioned cases that opine that an across-the-board proscription against live witness testimony violates due process appear distinguishable from the present case in that nothing in those cases suggests that the absolute prohibitions on the calling of any witnesses or certain categories of witnesses were even purported to be based on institutional security.

McGuinness cross-appeals the grant of summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity in favor of the defendants on his claims for damages.   We reverse the declaratory judgment in favor of McGuinness and affirm the summary judgment on the damages claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1991, McGuinness got into an altercation with a prison guard, Sergeant John Andrade, and was charged with various prison disciplinary code violations, including being out of place, disrupting the security or orderly running of the institution, fighting and use of abusive language.   A few days later, McGuinness was notified of a disciplinary hearing and moved to MCI-CJ's West Wing Segregation Unit (\"West Wing\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He was placed in the upper tier of the West Wing, i.e., in the AAU.   McGuinness' disciplinary hearing was held in the West Wing on January 9, 1992.   Both McGuinness and Andrade testified and Andrade submitted his written report.   McGuinness admitted that he argued with, used foul language toward, and struck Andrade, but claimed that he was provoked when Andrade pushed him.   Andrade acknowledged that he pushed McGuinness away when McGuinness got right up in his face.   McGuinness' request to call three inmate witnesses from the general population, (who he alleged were eyewitnesses), was denied \"for security reasons.\"   However, Officer Treddin considered their written affidavits.   Ultimately, Treddin deemed the three affidavits \"non-credible\" because in Treddin's opinion all three inmates saw the confrontation only in part.   Treddin found McGuinness guilty based on McGuinness' own admissions and Andrade's written report and testimony.   Treddin imposed a sanction of 30 days in isolation and recommended that McGuinness lose 100 days of good-time credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGuinness appealed the matter to defendant Superintendent Duval, claiming, inter alia, that Treddin wrongfully portrayed McGuinness as the aggressor and wrongfully denied his request for witnesses due to McGuinness' placement in the West Wing.   He argued that his witnesses \"would have been able to explain what they saw much better if given a chance to give an oral testimony.\"   Duval denied McGuinness' appeal.   Eventually, the incident was referred to the DSU board and, pursuant to a finding, based on this November 1991 incident and a subsequent incident or incidents in January 1992, that McGuinness presented a substantial threat to the safety of others, McGuinness received a two year sentence of confinement to the DSU (in addition to the sanction of 30 days in isolation and loss of 100 days of good-time credit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1993, McGuinness filed an action in the district court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, naming Officer Treddin and Superintendent Duval as defendants (as well as other prison officials not pertinent here).   McGuinness' complaint raised several claims, most of which are not involved in these cross-appeals.   The counts which remain relevant are these:  Count 2 alleged that Treddin violated McGuinness' right to due process.   In particular, McGuinness alleged that he had been unlawfully transferred to the West Wing prior to any guilty finding and that Treddin used this alleged illegal placement in the West Wing as the sole reason for denying his request for witnesses.   Count 4 alleged that Superintendent Duval violated McGuinness' right to due process by denying his appeal without any explanation.   McGuinness asked for compensatory and punitive damages on these claims.   In Count 6 McGuinness requested a declaratory judgment that his placement in the West Wing was illegal and the denial of witnesses due to his placement there violated due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties cross-moved for summary judgment.   In a memorandum and order, dated March 15, 1995, the district court concluded that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether (a) McGuinness' placement in the AAU constituted an unlawful placement in a segregation unit prior to a guilty finding, the imposition of sanctions, and the appropriate finding of \"substantial threat\" by the Commissioner;  and (b) Treddin's refusal to allow McGuinness to call witnesses violated \"the rule of Kenney [v. Commissioner of Correction, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2234278\"><a href=\"/opinion/2234278/kenney-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2234278\"><a href=\"/opinion/2234278/kenney-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span> </a></span>(1984) ].\"  The court, therefore, declined to enter a declaratory judgment, as requested in Count 6, in any party's favor. The court did conclude, however, that the state of the law on this issue was confused and, thus, Treddin and Duval were entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity on McGuinness' damages claims--Count 2 (Treddin) and Count 4 (Duval).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 6 then went to a one-day bench trial at which Officer Treddin testified.   The court's findings of fact and rulings of law can be found at McGuinness v. Dubois, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, 21-23 (D.Mass.1995).   In brief, the court ruled that the AAU is not a DSU.   Thus, the court rejected McGuinness' initial premise, i.e., that his placement in the AAU constituted an unlawful placement in the DSU prior to the required findings by the Commissioner.   Nonetheless, the court held that McGuinness was \"not given the protections afforded him by Department of Correction regulations\" as interpreted by Kenney and subsequent caselaw.   The court declared that Treddin's determination must be set aside and that the rulings that followed the disciplinary hearing are void and of no effect and may play no part whatsoever in any further classification, penal, disciplinary, or release decisions with respect to McGuinness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted at the outset, Treddin and Duval appeal this declaratory judgment and McGuinness cross-appeals the March 15 summary judgment denying his claims for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Wolff v.

The district court found, and the defendants do not dispute, that MCI-CJ has an institutional policy of denying an inmate's request to call inmate witnesses from the general population at a disciplinary hearing held in the West Wing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  This policy is based on the heightened security requirements in the West Wing, which houses inmates with a demonstrated proclivity for violence and disruption, and on the resulting effect that bringing witnesses into the West Wing has on the allocation of corrections officers there and in the rest of the prison.   Any inmate entering the West Wing from the general population has to be strip-searched and accompanied by two correction officers;  restraints are required to move inmates within the West Wing;  and restraints may, or may not, be used in the presence of hearing officers at disciplinary hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held that the Kenney decision, i.e., \"the rule of Kenney,\" and subsequent caselaw prohibits the denial of witnesses' testimony simply based on an inmate's location in the West Wing and that the caselaw and the prison regulations require an individualized assessment that calling a particular witness would be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.   The court found that no individualized assessment occurred in McGuinness' case and thus McGuinness was not given the protections afforded him by the regulations as interpreted by Kenney and its progeny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To a large extent, however, Kenney was simply an interpretation of the requirements of state law.   In Kenney, inmate Kenney had been transferred to the DSU prior to his disciplinary hearing on assault charges and confined there under the same conditions as those inmates transferred to the DSU pursuant to a finding by the Commissioner that their behavior posed a substantial threat to the residents, property, or operations of the institution.  Kenney v.

At his disciplinary hearing, Kenney's request that the two alleged victims (both inmates in the general population) be allowed to appear as witnesses was denied.   Kenney subsequently brought an action in state court and on appeal the SJC found that the prison officials had violated their own regulations, which have the force of state law, by placing Kenney in a DSU cell for committing a disciplinary offense before Kenney had been found guilty, before sanctions had been imposed, and before the Commissioner had found that Kenney posed a substantial threat to the institution.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2234278\"><a href=\"/opinion/2234278/kenney-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 33-34, </a></span><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2234278\"><a href=\"/opinion/2234278/kenney-v-commissioner-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span>.

We find that, on the facts of this case, the district court erred in concluding that the application of this policy to McGuinness violated his right to due process.   McGuinness contends that he was provoked into striking Andrade and that should lessen any penalty imposed.   McGuinness concedes that, contrary to the prison rules, he did not inform Officer Treddin in advance about the content of the expected testimony of Justin Holmes and Jack Shea, other than characterizing them as eyewitnesses.   Nonetheless, Treddin obtained their affidavits, along with the affidavit of a third inmate, Michael Dowd, whose testimony McGuinness had not previously requested.   Treddin concluded that none of the three saw the whole confrontation--a factual determination certainly within his discretion to make and not within a court's competency to overturn.

Dubois, No. 92-1819 (Mass.Super.Ct. July 20, 1992), nor Abrazinski v. DuBois, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span> </span>(D.Mass.1995), further support any due process determination.   Guyton was found to have been unlawfully held in the DSU and thus Guyton is simply a straightforward application of Kenney.   The Abrazinski court's discussion of Kenney was dicta and, in any event, for reasons <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">discussed,</span> supra</span>, we disagree with that court's reading of Kenney as holding that \"isolation in a segregation unit alone, even if legal, is not sufficient to support a denial of witnesses.\"  Abrazinski v. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">DuBois,</span> <span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> at <span class=\"page\">323</span> </span>(emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We note that while the Bartholomew opinion stated that a blanket proscription against calling certain types of witnesses violated the \"suggestion\" in Wolff that the decision to deny live witness testimony should be made on a case-by-case analysis of the potential hazards which may flow from the calling of a particular person, Bartholomew v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"397442\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Watson,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/397442/michael-c-bartholomew-scott-m-baldwin-earl-w-branch-louis-chavarria/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span>, later cases, in citing Bartholomew, have, without comment, transformed this characterization of Wolff's \"suggestion\" into a requirement.   See, e.g., Mitchell v. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705220\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Dupnik,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/705220/95-cal-daily-op-serv-7572-95-daily-journal-dar-12992-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span></p>\n        <p>We also note that, apart from Bartholomew, all of the above-mentioned cases that opine that an across-the-board proscription against live witness testimony violates due process appear distinguishable from the present case in that nothing in those cases suggests that the absolute prohibitions on the calling of any witnesses or certain categories of witnesses were even purported to be based on institutional security.   And, in each case cited, including Bartholomew, the across-the-board prohibition extended prison-wide in an undifferentiated fashion to all disciplinary hearings.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> And, it is not certain that even this suggestion was made at the disciplinary hearing so that Treddin could consider it.   Rather, on the record before us, this suggestion first appears in McGuinness' written appeal of the disciplinary finding to the prison superintendent</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
