The district  court found reasonable cause to  believe that\r\n\nthe respondents  violated their duty to bargain in  good faith by\r\n\nrefusing  to  provide  the   bargaining  representative  of   its\r\n\nemployees   with   requested   financial   documents.       Based\r\n\nsubstantially  on this  violation,  the district  court issued  a\r\n\npreliminary injunction.  Finding neither clear error nor abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion, we affirm.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          Molinos de Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"MPR\") is  a wholly owned\r\n\nsubsidiary of  ConAgra, Inc. (collectively,  the \"respondents\").1\r\n\nMPR maintains three production facilities in Puerto Rico where it\r\n\nmills,  sells and distributes wheat, corn flour, and animal feed.\r\n\nIn June  1993, Congreso  de Uniones  Industriales de  Puerto Rico\r\n\n(\"the union\") and  the respondents began  negotiations for a  new\r\n\ncollective  bargaining agreement, covering unit employees at MPR,\r\n\nto replace  an existing agreement, which  was nearing expiration.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The district court found reasonable cause to believe that  the\r\ntwo corporate entities  are \"joint employers\"  in the context  of\r\nlabor relations.  As discussed infra, this finding is not clearly\r                                              \r\nerroneous and is,  accordingly, affirmed.  We  therefore refer to\r\nthe  two companies jointly as  the respondents.   In addition, we\r\nnote that the district court's finding of joint employers applies\r\nto ConAgra, Inc., and/or Conagra Grain Processing Companies, Inc.\r\nFor convenience sake only, we refer simply to \"ConAgra.\"   \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nThe  parties soon  became involved  in a  dispute over  wages and\r\n\nbenefits  -- respondents wanted to cut them, and the union sought\r\n\nincreases.    On several  occasions,  the  union requested  MPR's\r\n\naudited financial statements  for the past five years to evaluate\r\n\nrespondent's bargaining position.  Respondents repeatedly refused\r\n\nto provide  the requested information,  and after four  months of\r\n\nbargaining  and 18  bargaining sessions,  declared an  impasse on\r\n\nOctober  28, 1993.  On October 29, respondents informed the union\r\n\nthat forty  employees would  be  laid off  on November  1st.   On\r\n\nNovember 1st, respondents locked  out employees reporting to work\r\n\nat MPR.   Respondents subsequently hired  replacement workers and\r\n\ncontinued operations.2\r\n\n          The union  filed an  unfair labor practice  charge with\r\n\nthe National Labor Relations Board (the \"NLRB\").  The NLRB issued\r\n\nan  unfair labor  practice  complaint on  March  25, 1994,  which\r\n\ncharged  that the  respondents, as  joint employers,  violated   \r\n\n8(a)(1), (3) and  (5) of  the National Labor  Relations Act  (the\r\n\n\"NLRA\"), 29 U.S.C.     158(a)(1),(3), by, inter  alia, failing to\r                                                               \r\n\nbargain in good  faith when it refused to provide  the union with\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Respondents  argued to the district court that the lockout was\r\nimplemented  in lieu of the  lay-off, and that  the lay-off never\r\noccurred.    The district  court  appears to  have  rejected this\r\nargument:  \"The problem with this theory  is that at no time have\r\nRespondents stated to the Union that the  lay-off contemplated in\r\nthe  implementation  of their  final  offer has  been  set aside.\r\nThus,  the number of employees  in the unit  remains currently at\r\nminus  forty  employees.\"   We find  the  record unclear  on this\r\nquestion.  Because  resolution of this  issue is unnecessary  for\r\npurposes  of  our  decision,  we  consider  only  the  fact  that\r\nrespondents announced the lay-offs,  and not whether the lay-offs\r\nwere actually implemented.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthe  requested financial  information, unilaterally  changing the\r\n\nterms and  conditions of  employment before impasse  was reached,\r\n\nunlawfully laying  off 40 employees,  and imposing a  lockout and\r\n\nreplacing employees with temporary employees to compel acceptance\r\n\nof its bargaining position.  An administrative  law judge (\"ALJ\")\r\n\nconducted a  hearing on the matter  from May 9 to 13,  1994.3  On\r\n\nJune  10,  1994, the  NLRB petitioned  the  district court  for a\r\n\ntemporary  injunction pursuant to  section 10(j) of  the NLRA, 29\r\n\nU.S.C.   160(j).\r\n\n          After   a   hearing,  the   district  court   issued  a\r\n\ncomprehensive and  detailed opinion in which  it found reasonable\r\n\ncause to  believe, inter alia,  that:   (1) respondents  violated\r                                       \r\n\n   8(a)(1) and (5) by refusing to provide the requested financial\r\n\ninformation  to  the  union;  (2)  the  refusal  to  furnish  the\r\n\nfinancial  statements precluded  valid  impasse; (3)  respondents\r\n\nviolated   8(a)(5) by making unilateral changes  in the terms and\r\n\nconditions of employment  when no valid impasse existed;  and (4)\r\n\nrespondents violated    8(a)(3) and (1) by locking out employees,\r\n\nand using replacements, in  furtherance of its tainted bargaining\r\n\nposition.   The court  further concluded  that the  standards for\r\n\nissuance  of a  preliminary  injunction were  met, and  that such\r\n\nrelief  was just  and proper  to preserve  the NLRB's  ability to\r\n\nprovide meaningful relief in the underlying unfair labor practice\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   The ALJ  issued a decision on  June 13, 1995.   The ALJ found\r\nthat respondents  committed various unfair labor  practices, many\r\nof which  are relevant to  the issues  in this appeal.   We  take\r\njudicial notice of the ALJ's decision.    \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\naction.   Finally,  the court found  reasonable cause  to believe\r\n\nthat  MPR and ConAgra, Inc., are joint employers for the purposes\r\n\nof labor relations.\r\n\n          The  district  court  issued  a  temporary  injunction,\r\n\npending  a final  resolution  by the  NLRB  of the  unfair  labor\r\n\npractice action,  directing the  employer, upon request,  to: (1)\r\n\nmeet and bargain with  the union; (2) restore  working conditions\r\n\nwhich  existed prior to October 28, 1993, and maintain them until\r\n\nthe parties  bargain in good faith to  an agreement or an impasse\r\n\non  the  changes;  (3)  provide  the  union  with  all  requested\r\n\ninformation necessary and relevant for collective bargaining; and\r\n\n(4) reinstate  locked out or terminated  employees.  Respondents'\r\n\nmotion for a stay pending appeal was denied by the district court\r\n\non  March 6, 1995,  and subsequently by  this court  on March 20,\r\n\n1995.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \r\n\n          Section 10(j) of the NLRA  authorizes the NLRB to seek,\r\n\nand the United  States district courts  to grant, interim  relief\r\n\npending  the NLRB's resolution of unfair labor practices.  See 29\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C. 160(j).4   In considering  a petition  for interim  relief\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  Section 10(j) provides:\r\n\n            The Board shall have power, upon issuance\r\n            of a complaint  as provided in subsection\r\n            (b) of  this  section charging  that  any\r\n            person  has engaged in  or is engaging in\r\n            an unfair labor practice, to petition any\r\n            district court of the United States . . .\r\n            for   appropriate  temporary   relief  or\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nunder    10(j), a  district court must  limit its inquiry  to (1)\r\n\nwhether the NLRB has shown \"reasonable cause\" to believe that the\r\n\nemployer has  committed the  unfair labor practices  alleged, and\r\n\n(2) whether injunctive relief  is \"just and proper.\"   See Pye v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSullivan  Bros.,  38  F.3d  58, 63  (1st  Cir.  1994) (collecting\r                         \r\n\ncases).   In  determining whether  the NLRB has  shown reasonable\r\n\ncause, the district court does not decide whether an unfair labor\r\n\npractice  actually  occurred;  rather,  its role  is  limited  to\r\n\ndetermining only whether the NLRB's position is \"fairly supported\r\n\nby  the evidence.\"    Id.

This\r\n            is  true about  an asserted  inability to\r\n            pay  an increase  in wages.   If  such an\r\n            argument is important  enough to  present\r\n            in the give and take of bargaining, it is\r\n            important  enough to require some sort of\r\n            proof of its accuracy.\r\n\nTruitt Mfg., 351 U.S. at 152-53.5  \r                     \r\n\n          Circuit   courts   interpreting   Truitt    have   long\r                                                            \r\n\ndistinguished  between  cases  in  which an  employer  claims  an\r\n\ninability to pay the  requested wage increase and those  in which\r\n\nthe employer  maintains that  complying with the  union's request\r\n\nwould place it at a competitive disadvantage, ordering disclosure\r\n\nin the former but denying  it in the latter.

The NLRB explained:\r\n\n               The  employer  who  claims  a  present\r\n            inability    to  pay,  or  a  prospective\r\n            inability  to pay  during the  life of  a\r\n            contract  being  negotiated  is  claiming\r\n            essentially  that  it  cannot  pay.    By\r\n            contrast,  the  employer who  claims only\r\n            economic difficulties  or business losses\r\n            or  the prospect  of  layoffs  is  simply\r\n            saying that it does not want to pay.\r\n\n               We  do not say that claims of economic\r\n            hardship  or  business   losses  or   the\r\n            prospect of layoffs can never amount to a\r\n            claim of inability to pay.   Depending on\r\n            the   facts   and   circumstances  of   a\r\n            particular   case,   the   evidence   may\r\n            establish that the employer  is asserting\r\n            that the economic problems have led to an\r\n            inability to pay or will do so during the\r\n            life  of  the  contract being  negotiated\r\n            . . . .

The   court  concluded   that   \"[w]hile   Respondents\r               \r\n\ncontinuously reiterated  that they needed  to remain  competitive\r\n\nand denied claiming inability to pay, the 'essential core' of its\r\n\nbargaining posture was  in effect  that it could  not afford  the\r\n\nterms  of the successor contract.\"  The district court based this\r\n\nconclusion  upon the  substance  of the  message communicated  by\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nrespondents  to the  union  over the  course  of the  four  month\r\n\nbargaining period.   In particular, the district  court noted the\r\n\nfollowing allegations by the NLRB.  \r\n\n          During the first bargaining session, the negotiator for\r\n\nrespondents spoke  of the difficult situation  facing the company\r\n\nand  stated \"if  we  don't take  immediate  measures there  is  a\r\n\nprobability that we won't  be here in the future.\"   Respondents'\r\n\nnegotiator  also suggested  that ConAgra,  Inc., was  considering\r\n\nclosing  the mill in Puerto  Rico and bringing  in flour directly\r\n\nfrom the  United States.   In addition,  respondents' negotiators\r\n\nmade the  following statements  during the course  of bargaining:\r\n\n(1) \"The situation is a serious one and fragile.\"; (2) \"If we are\r\n\nnot  competitive we cannot survive.\";  (3) \"Things like this [the\r\n\nneed  to eliminate the  granting of a soap  bar to employees] are\r\n\nwhat  makes us not competitive vis- -vis the other and could make\r\n\nus have  to close shop because  we cannot compete.\"; and  (4) \"We\r\n\nsee the  situation as quite  risky because of  our ability  to be\r\n\ncompetitive.\"  The  court also found it  significant that, during\r\n\nnegotiations, respondents told the union that it was necessary to\r\n\nsignificantly reduce  the number  of employees,  and then,  a day\r\n\nafter it declared  impasse, told the union that it had decided to\r\n\nlay-off forty employees (almost  30% of the unit) because  of its\r\n\neconomic position.   \r\n\n          Based on the  foregoing, the district court  determined\r\n\nthat  the NLRB  had shown  reasonable cause  to believe  that the\r\n\nemployer had committed an unfair labor practice by not disclosing\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nthe requested  financial information.   As noted  previously, the\r\n\ndistrict court's role in this matter was not to determine whether\r\n\nan  unfair labor  practice  actually occurred,  but to  determine\r\n\nwhether  the   NLRB's  position  is  \"fairly   supported  by  the\r\n\nevidence.\"  Sullivan Bros., 38 F.3d at 63 (quoting Centro M dico,\r                                                                          \r\n\n900 F.2d  at 450).  On  this record, we cannot  conclude that the\r\n\ndistrict court's conclusion was clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          Moreover,  we  think  our  conclusion,   reached  after\r\n\nindependently reviewing the record, is confirmed by the fact that\r\n\nthe ALJ,  who held  a hearing  and took  evidence  on the  NLRB's\r\n\nallegations,  concluded that the  respondents violated    8(a)(5)\r\n\nand  (1)  by refusing  to provide  the  union with  the requested\r\n\nfinancial  information.   Specifically,  the ALJ  found that  the\r\n\nfacts of the  instant case  \"fall closer to  Shell than  Nielsen,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthereby bringing it 'within the gravitational field of Truitt.'\"\r                                                                       \r\n\n          Respondents'  most compelling  argument  on  appeal  is\r\n\nthat,   during   the   bargaining   process,   their  negotiators\r\n\nconsistently used  the phrase  \"long term\" when  discussing MPR's\r\n\nprospects  for survival.   The difficulty  with this  argument is\r\n\nthat the proposed  agreement under negotiations was  for a period\r\n\nof five  years.  While it  might be argued that  the phrase \"long\r\n\nterm\"  implies a time more than five  years hence, it can just as\r\n\npersuasively be argued that to most workers -- as opposed to, for\r\n\nexample, a corporate executive in charge of strategic planning --\r\n\n\"long  term\"  suggests  next year,  the  year  after,  etc.   The\r\n\nquestion  under Neilsen and Shell is whether the \"essential core\"\r                                           \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nof the employer's  bargaining position  amounts to a  claim of  a\r\n\npresent  inability to pay, or  of a prospective  inability to pay\r                                                                           \r\n\nduring the life  of a  contract being negotiated.

The record as a whole indicates that\r\nrespondents' willingness to disclose the information, subject  to\r\na confidentiality agreement, was tied to its  insistence that the\r\nunion first  demonstrate the relevancy of the  documents, and its\r\nrejection  of  the union's  assertion  that  the information  was\r\nrelevant  to substantiate  respondents'  assertion  that  it  was\r\nunable  to pay the increased wages.

We have upheld the district court's finding of reasonable\r\n\ncause  to  believe  that  the  sticking  point  was  respondents'\r\n\ninsistence that it could not pay increased wages, and its illegal\r\n\nrefusal to  substantiate this claim.   Thus,  the district  court\r\n\nfound reasonable cause to  believe that the lockout in  this case\r\n\nwas  motivated by  respondents'  desire to  compel acceptance  of\r\n\ntheir  illegally  tainted  bargaining  position.    There  is  no\r\n\nquestion  that  a lockout  under  such  circumstances violates   \r\n\n8(a)(3) of  the NLRA.  See, e.g.,  American Cyanamid Co. v.

The court  also found that\r\n\nthe impetus for  respondents' decision to  seek wage and  benefit\r\n\ncuts   in  the  new  bargaining  session  was  a  change  in  the\r\n\norganizational structure of ConAgra,  pursuant to which MPR would\r\n\nbe  part  of more  than sixty  companies  known as  ConAgra Grain\r\n\nProcessing Company, and subsequently be compared to them.\r\n\n          Significantly,  the court  found  that ConAgra's  Vice-\r\n\nPresident of  Human  Resources, Raymond  Godbout (\"Godbout\")  was\r\n\nresponsible  for the  negotiation  strategy utilized  during  the\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nbargaining sessions, and acted throughout as an advisor to  MPR's\r\n\nnegotiator.   Moreover,  the  court found  that Godbout  actively\r\n\nparticipated  in the  bargaining  sessions, and  on one  occasion\r\n\nstated to the union  representative: \"what I would like  to do is\r\n\ngo back to my people  and talk with the persons at  the corporate\r\n\nlevel . . .  .  See if we  can sharpen the pencil and  present to\r\n\nyou what our position is.\"  In addition, the court found that the\r\n\ndrug policy proposed during negotiations was the same policy used\r\n\nby ConAgra at its other plants, and that MPR's employees have the\r\n\nsame  pension plan  as  that of  ConAgra  employees.   The  court\r\n\nfurther found  that, after  the lockout,  Godbout became  the \"de\r\n\nfacto  spokesperson\" for  the  respondents, and  that  henceforth\r\n\nConAgra was  determining labor policies for  MPR through Godbout.\r\n\nThe court also found that, after the lockout, replacement workers\r\n\nwere provided and paid by ConAgra.\r\n\n          Based  on these  factors,  the  court found  reasonable\r\n\ncause to believe MPR and ConAgra are joint employers for purposes\r\n\nof the pertinent collective bargaining negotiations.  The court's\r\n\nfactual  findings are  \"fairly  supported by  the evidence,\"  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nSullivan  Bros., 38  F.3d at  63, and  its finding  of reasonable\r                         \r\n\ncause is not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          E.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCentro M dico, 900 F.2d at 454; Asseo v. Pan American Grain  Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n805 F.2d 23, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1986).  Moreover, we  agree with the\r\n\ndistrict  court that the  fact that the lockout  in this case was\r\n\ndirected to  \"the entire  work force\"  increases  the chances  of\r\n\nirreparable  harm.  See Maram, 722 F.2d  at 959.  In this regard,\r                                       \r\n\nthe  court  specifically  found  that  respondents'  conduct  had\r\n\nalready  caused many employees to  be in arrears  on their loans,\r\n\nwhich consequently damaged  their credit.   We find  no abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion in the court's finding  of a potential for irreparable\r\n\nharm.\r\n\n          Nor  do  we find  abuse  of discretion  in  the court's\r\n\ndetermination that the very real danger that the union would lose\r\n\nsupport  because  of  unfair  labor practices  committed  by  the\r\n\nemployer,  combined  with  the   actual  financial  harm  to  the\r\n\nemployees,   outweighs  any   harm  which   granting  preliminary\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\ninjunctive relief may cause the employer.  Cf. Centro M dico, 900\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 454.  Respondents argue that, if they are required to end\r\n\nthe  lockout and  reinstate  employees at  their former  wage and\r\n\nbenefit  levels,  their   \"market  share  could well  deteriorate\r\n\nfurther.\"   Respondents  stress that  this would  be particularly\r\n\nharmful if the NLRB later rules in their favor.  The first answer\r\n\nto  this argument  is that  we have  already upheld  the district\r\n\ncourt's  determination that there is a strong likelihood that the\r\n\nNLRB  will  not rule  in respondents'  favor.   This  finding, of\r\n\ncourse, informs our  balancing of  the harms, and  points in  the\r\n\ndirection  opposite  to  that  urged  by  respondents.    Second,\r\n\nrespondents'  unsupported  assertions  regarding loss  of  market\r\n\nshare amount to nothing more than bald speculation.  Finally, our\r\n\nresolution  of the first  three factors  leads to  the conclusion\r\n\nthat the district court  did not abuse its discretion  in finding\r\n\nthat the public interest  will be furthered by imposition  of the\r\n\ninterim  injunctive relief.   Given the high  number of employees\r\n\neffected by  the lockout,  cf. Maram,  722 F.2d at  960, and  the\r                                              \r\n\npotential that interim  relief will have  the salutary effect  of\r\n\nstrengthening the bargaining process, see Centro M dico, 900 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 455, the public interest in preliminary relief appears strong.\r\n\nContrary  to respondents'  assertions, we  do not  find  that the\r\n\nlength of time between the filing of charges by the union and the\r\n\nNLRB's application  for interim was, under  the circumstances, so\r\n\nunreasonable as to significantly  undercut the public interest in\r\n\npreliminary relief.\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Interim injunctive relief under    10(j) is appropriate\r\n\nto  restore  the status  quo \"when  the  circumstances of  a case\r\n\ncreate a reasonable apprehension that the efficacy of the Board's\r                                          \r\n\nfinal order  may be  nullified, or the  administrative procedures\r\n\nwill  be rendered meaningless.\"   Centro M dico, 900  F.2d at 455\r                                                         \r\n\n(quoting Angle v.

The district  court found reasonable cause to  believe that\r\n\nthe respondents  violated their duty to bargain in  good faith by\r\n\nrefusing  to  provide  the   bargaining  representative  of   its\r\n\nemployees   with   requested   financial   documents.       Based\r\n\nsubstantially  on this  violation,  the district  court issued  a\r\n\npreliminary injunction.

(\"MPR\") is  a wholly owned\r\n\nsubsidiary of  ConAgra, Inc. (collectively,  the \"respondents\").1\r\n\nMPR maintains three production facilities in Puerto Rico where it\r\n\nmills,  sells and distributes wheat, corn flour, and animal feed.\r\n\nIn June  1993, Congreso  de Uniones  Industriales de  Puerto Rico\r\n\n(\"the union\") and  the respondents began  negotiations for a  new\r\n\ncollective  bargaining agreement, covering unit employees at MPR,\r\n\nto replace  an existing agreement, which  was nearing expiration.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The district court found reasonable cause to believe that  the\r\ntwo corporate entities  are \"joint employers\"  in the context  of\r\nlabor relations.  As discussed infra, this finding is not clearly\r                                              \r\nerroneous and is,  accordingly, affirmed.  We  therefore refer to\r\nthe  two companies jointly as  the respondents.   In addition, we\r\nnote that the district court's finding of joint employers applies\r\nto ConAgra, Inc., and/or Conagra Grain Processing Companies, Inc.\r\nFor convenience sake only, we refer simply to \"ConAgra.\"   \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nThe  parties soon  became involved  in a  dispute over  wages and\r\n\nbenefits  -- respondents wanted to cut them, and the union sought\r\n\nincreases.    On several  occasions,  the  union requested  MPR's\r\n\naudited financial statements  for the past five years to evaluate\r\n\nrespondent's bargaining position.  Respondents repeatedly refused\r\n\nto provide  the requested information,  and after four  months of\r\n\nbargaining  and 18  bargaining sessions,  declared an  impasse on\r\n\nOctober  28, 1993.  On October 29, respondents informed the union\r\n\nthat forty  employees would  be  laid off  on November  1st.   On\r\n\nNovember 1st, respondents locked  out employees reporting to work\r\n\nat MPR.   Respondents subsequently hired  replacement workers and\r\n\ncontinued operations.2\r\n\n          The union  filed an  unfair labor practice  charge with\r\n\nthe National Labor Relations Board (the \"NLRB\").  The NLRB issued\r\n\nan  unfair labor  practice  complaint on  March  25, 1994,  which\r\n\ncharged  that the  respondents, as  joint employers,  violated   \r\n\n8(a)(1), (3) and  (5) of  the National Labor  Relations Act  (the\r\n\n\"NLRA\"), 29 U.S.C.     158(a)(1),(3), by, inter  alia, failing to\r                                                               \r\n\nbargain in good  faith when it refused to provide  the union with\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Respondents  argued to the district court that the lockout was\r\nimplemented  in lieu of the  lay-off, and that  the lay-off never\r\noccurred.    The district  court  appears to  have  rejected this\r\nargument:  \"The problem with this theory  is that at no time have\r\nRespondents stated to the Union that the  lay-off contemplated in\r\nthe  implementation  of their  final  offer has  been  set aside.\r\nThus,  the number of employees  in the unit  remains currently at\r\nminus  forty  employees.\"   We find  the  record unclear  on this\r\nquestion.  Because  resolution of this  issue is unnecessary  for\r\npurposes  of  our  decision,  we  consider  only  the  fact  that\r\nrespondents announced the lay-offs,  and not whether the lay-offs\r\nwere actually implemented.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthe  requested financial  information, unilaterally  changing the\r\n\nterms and  conditions of  employment before impasse  was reached,\r\n\nunlawfully laying  off 40 employees,  and imposing a  lockout and\r\n\nreplacing employees with temporary employees to compel acceptance\r\n\nof its bargaining position.  An administrative  law judge (\"ALJ\")\r\n\nconducted a  hearing on the matter  from May 9 to 13,  1994.3  On\r\n\nJune  10,  1994, the  NLRB petitioned  the  district court  for a\r\n\ntemporary  injunction pursuant to  section 10(j) of  the NLRA, 29\r\n\nU.S.C.   160(j).\r\n\n          After   a   hearing,  the   district  court   issued  a\r\n\ncomprehensive and  detailed opinion in which  it found reasonable\r\n\ncause to  believe, inter alia,  that:   (1) respondents  violated\r                                       \r\n\n   8(a)(1) and (5) by refusing to provide the requested financial\r\n\ninformation  to  the  union;  (2)  the  refusal  to  furnish  the\r\n\nfinancial  statements precluded  valid  impasse; (3)  respondents\r\n\nviolated   8(a)(5) by making unilateral changes  in the terms and\r\n\nconditions of employment  when no valid impasse existed;  and (4)\r\n\nrespondents violated    8(a)(3) and (1) by locking out employees,\r\n\nand using replacements, in  furtherance of its tainted bargaining\r\n\nposition.   The court  further concluded  that the  standards for\r\n\nissuance  of a  preliminary  injunction were  met, and  that such\r\n\nrelief  was just  and proper  to preserve  the NLRB's  ability to\r\n\nprovide meaningful relief in the underlying unfair labor practice\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   The ALJ  issued a decision on  June 13, 1995.   The ALJ found\r\nthat respondents  committed various unfair labor  practices, many\r\nof which  are relevant to  the issues  in this appeal.   We  take\r\njudicial notice of the ALJ's decision.    \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\naction.   Finally,  the court found  reasonable cause  to believe\r\n\nthat  MPR and ConAgra, Inc., are joint employers for the purposes\r\n\nof labor relations.\r\n\n          The  district  court  issued  a  temporary  injunction,\r\n\npending  a final  resolution  by the  NLRB  of the  unfair  labor\r\n\npractice action,  directing the  employer, upon request,  to: (1)\r\n\nmeet and bargain with  the union; (2) restore  working conditions\r\n\nwhich  existed prior to October 28, 1993, and maintain them until\r\n\nthe parties  bargain in good faith to  an agreement or an impasse\r\n\non  the  changes;  (3)  provide  the  union  with  all  requested\r\n\ninformation necessary and relevant for collective bargaining; and\r\n\n(4) reinstate  locked out or terminated  employees.  Respondents'\r\n\nmotion for a stay pending appeal was denied by the district court\r\n\non  March 6, 1995,  and subsequently by  this court  on March 20,\r\n\n1995.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \r\n\n          Section 10(j) of the NLRA  authorizes the NLRB to seek,\r\n\nand the United  States district courts  to grant, interim  relief\r\n\npending  the NLRB's resolution of unfair labor practices.

If  such an\r\n            argument is important  enough to  present\r\n            in the give and take of bargaining, it is\r\n            important  enough to require some sort of\r\n            proof of its accuracy.\r\n\nTruitt </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mfg.,</span> <span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">152-53</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.5  \r                     \r\n\n          Circuit   courts   interpreting   Truitt    have   long\r                                                            \r\n\ndistinguished  between  cases  in  which an  employer  claims  an\r\n\ninability to pay the  requested wage increase and those  in which\r\n\nthe employer  maintains that  complying with the  union's request\r\n\nwould place it at a competitive disadvantage, ordering disclosure\r\n\nin the former but denying  it in the latter.

By\r\n            contrast,  the  employer who  claims only\r\n            economic difficulties  or business losses\r\n            or  the prospect  of  layoffs  is  simply\r\n            saying that it does not want to pay.\r\n\n               We  do not say that claims of economic\r\n            hardship  or  business   losses  or   the\r\n            prospect of layoffs can never amount to a\r\n            claim of inability to pay.

The   court  concluded   that   \"[w]hile   Respondents\r               \r\n\ncontinuously reiterated  that they needed  to remain  competitive\r\n\nand denied claiming inability to pay, the 'essential core' of its\r\n\nbargaining posture was  in effect  that it could  not afford  the\r\n\nterms  of the successor contract.\"  The district court based this\r\n\nconclusion  upon the  substance  of the  message communicated  by\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nrespondents  to the  union  over the  course  of the  four  month\r\n\nbargaining period.   In particular, the district  court noted the\r\n\nfollowing allegations by the NLRB.  \r\n\n          During the first bargaining session, the negotiator for\r\n\nrespondents spoke  of the difficult situation  facing the company\r\n\nand  stated \"if  we  don't take  immediate  measures there  is  a\r\n\nprobability that we won't  be here in the future.\"   Respondents'\r\n\nnegotiator  also suggested  that ConAgra,  Inc., was  considering\r\n\nclosing  the mill in Puerto  Rico and bringing  in flour directly\r\n\nfrom the  United States.   In addition,  respondents' negotiators\r\n\nmade the  following statements  during the course  of bargaining:\r\n\n(1) \"The situation is a serious one and fragile.\"; (2) \"If we are\r\n\nnot  competitive we cannot survive.\";  (3) \"Things like this [the\r\n\nneed  to eliminate the  granting of a soap  bar to employees] are\r\n\nwhat  makes us not competitive vis- -vis the other and could make\r\n\nus have  to close shop because  we cannot compete.\"; and  (4) \"We\r\n\nsee the  situation as quite  risky because of  our ability  to be\r\n\ncompetitive.\"  The  court also found it  significant that, during\r\n\nnegotiations, respondents told the union that it was necessary to\r\n\nsignificantly reduce  the number  of employees,  and then,  a day\r\n\nafter it declared  impasse, told the union that it had decided to\r\n\nlay-off forty employees (almost  30% of the unit) because  of its\r\n\neconomic position.   \r\n\n          Based on the  foregoing, the district court  determined\r\n\nthat  the NLRB  had shown  reasonable cause  to believe  that the\r\n\nemployer had committed an unfair labor practice by not disclosing\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nthe requested  financial information.   As noted  previously, the\r\n\ndistrict court's role in this matter was not to determine whether\r\n\nan  unfair labor  practice  actually occurred,  but to  determine\r\n\nwhether  the   NLRB's  position  is  \"fairly   supported  by  the\r\n\nevidence.\"  Sullivan </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680707\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Bros.,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/680707/in-re-rosemary-pye-on-behalf-of-national-labor-relations-board-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">63</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(quoting Centro M </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539798\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">dico,</span>\r                                                                          \r\n\n<a href=\"/opinion/539798/mary-zelma-asseo-regional-director-of-the-twenty-fourth-region-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  at <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">).

The difficulty  with this  argument is\r\n\nthat the proposed  agreement under negotiations was  for a period\r\n\nof five  years.  While it  might be argued that  the phrase \"long\r\n\nterm\"  implies a time more than five  years hence, it can just as\r\n\npersuasively be argued that to most workers -- as opposed to, for\r\n\nexample, a corporate executive in charge of strategic planning --\r\n\n\"long  term\"  suggests  next year,  the  year  after,  etc.   The\r\n\nquestion  under Neilsen and Shell is whether the \"essential core\"\r                                           \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nof the employer's  bargaining position  amounts to a  claim of  a\r\n\npresent  inability to pay, or  of a prospective  inability to pay\r                                                                           \r\n\nduring the life  of a  contract being negotiated.   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Neilsen,</span>  <span class=\"volume\">305</span>\r                                                                     \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span>  at <span class=\"page\">701</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Shell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">491815</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  at *1-2.

The court  also found that\r\n\nthe impetus for  respondents' decision to  seek wage and  benefit\r\n\ncuts   in  the  new  bargaining  session  was  a  change  in  the\r\n\norganizational structure of ConAgra,  pursuant to which MPR would\r\n\nbe  part  of more  than sixty  companies  known as  ConAgra Grain\r\n\nProcessing Company, and subsequently be compared to them.\r\n\n          Significantly,  the court  found  that ConAgra's  Vice-\r\n\nPresident of  Human  Resources, Raymond  Godbout (\"Godbout\")  was\r\n\nresponsible  for the  negotiation  strategy utilized  during  the\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nbargaining sessions, and acted throughout as an advisor to  MPR's\r\n\nnegotiator.   Moreover,  the  court found  that Godbout  actively\r\n\nparticipated  in the  bargaining  sessions, and  on one  occasion\r\n\nstated to the union  representative: \"what I would like  to do is\r\n\ngo back to my people  and talk with the persons at  the corporate\r\n\nlevel . . .  .  See if we  can sharpen the pencil and  present to\r\n\nyou what our position is.\"  In addition, the court found that the\r\n\ndrug policy proposed during negotiations was the same policy used\r\n\nby ConAgra at its other plants, and that MPR's employees have the\r\n\nsame  pension plan  as  that of  ConAgra  employees.   The  court\r\n\nfurther found  that, after  the lockout,  Godbout became  the \"de\r\n\nfacto  spokesperson\" for  the  respondents, and  that  henceforth\r\n\nConAgra was  determining labor policies for  MPR through Godbout.\r\n\nThe court also found that, after the lockout, replacement workers\r\n\nwere provided and paid by ConAgra.\r\n\n          Based  on these  factors,  the  court found  reasonable\r\n\ncause to believe MPR and ConAgra are joint employers for purposes\r\n\nof the pertinent collective bargaining negotiations.

The   court\r\n\nmeticulously  and comprehensively  applied the  appropriate legal\r\n\nstandards to  the NLRB's  allegations.  Respondents  challenge to\r\n\nthe  district  court's finding  in this  regard  is limited  to a\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nrehash of their arguments that the court clearly erred in finding\r\n\nreasonable cause on  each of the alleged  unfair labor practices.\r\n\nContrary to respondents' arguments, the district court's findings\r\n\nare amply supported by both the record and pertinent case law.\r\n\n          The district court found the potential for  irreparable\r\n\ninjury  in the absence of interim relief because of the potential\r\n\neffect of the large  scale employee lockout on union  support and\r\n\nthe union's  ability  to bargain  effectively  on behalf  of  its\r\n\nemployees.   The court  specifically found  that the  lockout had\r\n\nalready caused an  erosion in  union support.   Erosion of  union\r\n\nsupport cannot be  remedied by  the NLRB's ultimate  order.

Respondents argue that, if they are required to end\r\n\nthe  lockout and  reinstate  employees at  their former  wage and\r\n\nbenefit  levels,  their   \"market  share  could well  deteriorate\r\n\nfurther.\"   Respondents  stress that  this would  be particularly\r\n\nharmful if the NLRB later rules in their favor.  The first answer\r\n\nto  this argument  is that  we have  already upheld  the district\r\n\ncourt's  determination that there is a strong likelihood that the\r\n\nNLRB  will  not rule  in respondents'  favor.   This  finding, of\r\n\ncourse, informs our  balancing of  the harms, and  points in  the\r\n\ndirection  opposite  to  that  urged  by  respondents.    Second,\r\n\nrespondents'  unsupported  assertions  regarding loss  of  market\r\n\nshare amount to nothing more than bald speculation.  Finally, our\r\n\nresolution  of the first  three factors  leads to  the conclusion\r\n\nthat the district court  did not abuse its discretion  in finding\r\n\nthat the public interest  will be furthered by imposition  of the\r\n\ninterim  injunctive relief.
