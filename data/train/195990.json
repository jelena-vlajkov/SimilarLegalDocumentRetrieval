He was then sentenced to the statutory maximum of\n\n120 months' imprisonment.   Powell challenges his  conviction\n\nand sentence  on  a  variety  of grounds.    After  carefully\n\nreading  the record  and considering  Powell's arguments,  we\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \n\nA.  General Background\r            A.  General Background\r                                  \n\n          At  shortly after  2:00  p.m. on  October 7,  1992,\n\nPowell was standing  outside of  his truck.   He was  holding\n\nfood and conversing with Arvetta Boykins -- his girlfriend --\n\nand Boykins' mother as the  two women sat in the truck.   The\n\ntruck  was  parked  on  Boston's  Humboldt  Avenue  near  its\n\nintersection with  Ruthven  Street and  across from  Humboldt\n\nLiquors.  As this conversation  was taking place, a  grayish-\n\nsilver  Subaru  drove slowly  down  Ruthven  and turned  onto\n\nHumboldt.   There were four young men  in the Subaru, each of\n\nwhom was wearing a hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled up.\n\n          As the  Subaru proceeded down Humboldt,  the men in\n\nthe car  yelled something to a  couple of young men  -- Chris\n\nCheney  and  Ernest  Rhodes  --  who  were  standing  out  on\n\nHumboldt.  Either Rhodes  or Cheney yelled back.   After this\n\nexchange, the driver of the Subaru put the car in reverse and\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\naccelerated   quickly,  making   a  loud   screeching  sound.\n\nObserving this,  Powell handed  his food to  his girlfriend's\n\nmother and told the two women  to \"get out of here.\"  Knowing\n\nthat trouble  was brewing,  they quickly complied  by driving\n\noff.  Powell then ran up Ruthven.\n\n          By about 2:30 p.m., Powell had returned to Humboldt\n\nAvenue and was  talking with  Cheney and Rhodes  in front  of\n\nHumboldt Liquors.  Around this same time,  Stanley Owens came\n\naround the corner of Ruthven and Humboldt on a mountain bike.\n\nHe  had his hand in his jacket  pocket and was leaning to his\n\nleft.   At  least  one other  youth also  came  on the  scene\n\nsimultaneously.    At  some  point,  gunfire  erupted.    The\n\ngunfire, which came from at least three guns, was  continuous\n\nand lasted  six or  more seconds.   Three  persons, including\n\nPowell,  were wounded  in  the shoot-out;  Owens was  killed.\n\nCheney and Rhodes  escaped injury by  taking cover inside  of\n\nHumboldt Liquors.  Within an hour of the shooting, Powell was\n\narrested.  At the time of his arrest, Powell was standing  in\n\nan  alley  not  far  from  the intersection  of  Ruthven  and\n\nHumboldt, and was holding a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog handgun.\n\nHe also  had a walking  cane with him.   It was  subsequently\n\ndetermined  that  a bullet  from  the .44  had  killed Owens.\n\nPowell does not dispute that he fired two shots  with the .44\n\nduring the shoot-out.\n\nB.  The Necessity Defense\r            B.  The Necessity Defense\r                                     \n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          At trial, the  government argued  that Powell  shot\n\nOwens with a gun he  had brought to the crime scene.   Powell\n\nconsistently denied this, asserting as an affirmative defense\n\nthat he  took possession of the .44  only out of necessity in\n\nthe  midst of  the shoot-out.   When  he was in  an ambulance\n\nafter the shooting, Powell told an arresting officer that the\n\nyouths  in the gray Subaru had started shooting from the car,\n\nthat a  light-skinned black  male had alighted  and continued\n\nthe shooting,  that he (Powell) ran towards this shooter, and\n\nthat  the shooter then lost control of the weapon, dropped it\n\nto  the ground, and jumped  back into the  Subaru, which sped\n\noff.  Powell  stated that he picked up the gun and ran to the\n\nalley in  which he was arrested.   He did  not mention firing\n\nthe weapon at anyone.\n\n          To  clarify how  the  shooter lost  control of  the\n\nweapon, the officer  asked Powell  to repeat his  story.   At\n\nthis point,  Powell told  the officer that  the light-skinned\n\nmale got out  of the Subaru, began the  shooting, and fled on\n\nfoot.   He  did not  mention the  shooter dropping  or losing\n\ncontrol of his weapon.  When the officer asked how the weapon\n\nended up on the ground, Powell did not answer.\n\n          At trial, Powell  had a third  account of what  had\n\nhappened.  Powell testified  that he heard shots ring  out as\n\nhe stood in front of Humboldt Liquors talking with Cheney and\n\nRhodes.   While Cheney  and Rhodes  sought refuge inside  the\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nstore,  Powell  began  running  up  the  street  towards  the\n\nintersection of Humboldt and  Ruthven.  Just then, a  man who\n\nwas pulling a  gun out of his pocket came  running around the\n\ncorner.   The man pointed the  gun at him, but  was unable to\n\nfire it before  Powell was upon him.   The two  scuffled, and\n\nthe gun fell  to the ground.  The man  fled around the corner\n\nand  Powell picked up  the gun.   Powell began to  run across\n\nRuthven and  was shot in the leg.  He turned around and fired\n\ntwo shots  at  his assailant.   He  then ran  up Humboldt  to\n\nHomestead Street,  turned left on Homestead,  and headed into\n\nan alley,  where he found a  walking cane.  He  stayed in the\n\nalley until he was arrested.\n\nC.  Other Guns\r            C.  Other Guns\r                          \n\n          After the shooting, an arresting  officer retrieved\n\na set  of keys from Powell.   The keys were  to a two-bedroom\n\napartment  at Fairlawn  Estates  in the  Mattapan section  of\n\nBoston.    The  police  obtained  a  search warrant  for  the\n\napartment,  and executed  the warrant  the same night  as the\n\nshooting.   The search turned  up two additional  weapons:  a\n\nfully-loaded black Taurus 9 mm. semi-automatic pistol with an\n\nobliterated serial number; and a .38 caliber derringer loaded\n\nwith two  rounds of ammunition.   The Taurus was hidden  in a\n\nlaundry basket  located  in the  apartment's master  bedroom.\n\nThe  derringer was  hidden on  a closet  shelf in  the second\n\nbedroom.       Although  Powell  claimed to  be  nothing more\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthan a  sporadic visitor  to the Fairlawn  Estates apartment,\n\nthe  evidence,  taken  in  a  light  most  favorable  to  the\n\ngovernment,  established that  Powell  and Boykins  (Powell's\n\ngirlfriend) were living  there at the  time of the  shooting.\n\nPowell and  Boykins had  signed a rental  application, lease,\n\nlease addendum, and rules  and regulations acknowledgment for\n\nthe apartment in  August, 1992.   Moreover, Boykins told  the\n\ngrand  jury  that  she  and  Powell  (along  with  their  two\n\nchildren) were  living in  the apartment,  and  that she  and\n\nPowell  shared  the  master  bedroom.    This  testimony  was\n\nintroduced  at  trial.   Finally,  the  evidence showed  that\n\nPowell's name was on the mailbox for the apartment; that only\n\nPowell and Boykins had keys to the apartment; that Powell had\n\npersonally  visited the Fairlawn  Estates apartment manager's\n\noffice on  at least two occasions in  the months prior to the\n\nshooting; and  that Powell had once  telephoned the apartment\n\nmanager and made an oral request that  repairs be made to the\n\napartment.   Boykins testified  that Powell's cousin  and her\n\nchildren also were staying  at the apartment around  the time\n\nof  the shooting.  Powell testified that his cousin's husband\n\nwas staying there as well.\n\nD.  Proceedings Below\r            D.  Proceedings Below\r                                 \n\n          On  December 18,  1992, the  grand jury  returned a\n\nthree-count indictment  against Powell.  Count  I charged him\n\nwith being a felon  unlawfully in possession of the  .44 used\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nin the shooting. See 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).  Count II charged\r                                \n\nhim with being a felon unlawfully in possession of the Taurus\n\npistol,  the  derringer,  and  the ammunition  found  in  the\n\nFairlawn Estates apartment.   See id.  Count III  charged him\r                                                 \n\nwith unlawfully possessing a firearm -- the Taurus -- with an\n\nobliterated serial number.  See 18 U.S.C.   922(k).  Prior to\r                                           \n\ntrial,  the district court severed Counts II and III from the\n\ntrial of Count I.   The court also granted Powell's motion in\r                                                                         \n\nlimine requesting that the government not be allowed to refer\r                  \n\nto the firearms  and ammunition  which were  the subjects  of\n\nCounts  II and III  during its opening  statement or case-in-\n\nchief.    The court  did,  however,  reserve judgment  as  to\n\nwhether evidence  relating to Counts II and  III might become\n\nadmissible after the defense put on its case.  The government\n\ncomplied  with the court's order  and did not  allude to this\n\nevidence at any point during its case-in-chief.\n\n          The defense  called Arvetta Boykins  as a  witness.\n\nShe testified,  in response to a question by defense counsel,\n\nthat numerous random police searches of  Powell in the months\n\npreceding the shoot-out had failed to turn up a weapon on his\n\nperson or in his car.  The government then asked the court to\n\nrevisit  its  ruling in  limine.   At  this point,  the court\r                                           \n\nallowed the government to cross-examine Boykins about whether\n\nshe or  Powell had stored  in the Fairlawn  Estates apartment\n\nthe   firearms  described  in  Counts   II  and  III  of  the\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nindictment.  The court ruled that defense counsel had \"opened\n\nthe  door\" to this  inquiry by asking  Boykins whether \"she's\n\nseen  him with a weapon  on occasion.\"   Defense counsel, who\n\nhad  asked only about police searches of Powell in the months\n\npreceding the shoot-out, denied having asked such a question.\n\nBoykins  denied  that the  firearms  were  hers or  Powell's.\n\nAfter Boykins  completed her  testimony, Powell  himself took\n\nthe  stand and asserted, inter alia, that  he had never had a\r                                               \n\nfirearm on him in the summer of 1992. \n\n          Subsequently, the court permitted the government to\n\nintroduce the evidence  underlying Counts II and III  as part\n\nof its  rebuttal case.   The court informed the  jury that it\n\nshould  not  consider  the  firearms found  in  the  Fairlawn\n\nEstates apartment  at all unless  it first found  that Powell\n\npossessed them.   The court also  told the jury  that, if  it\n\nfound  that Powell did possess  these firearms, it should not\n\nconsider  this evidence \"to  show that the  defendant was the\n\nkind  of person  who possessed  firearms, but rather  to show\n\nthat  the defendant  had an  opportunity to  obtain firearms,\n\nthat  the  defendant had  knowledge  of  the availability  of\n\nfirearms, that [his possession of the .44] was not a question\n\nof mere  necessity.\"   See Fed.  R. Evid.  404(b).   The jury\r                                      \n\nconvicted  Powell  of the  crime alleged  in  Count I  of the\n\nindictment.  The government thereafter dismissed the  severed\n\nCounts, II and III.\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          On  March  29, 1994,  the district  court sentenced\n\nPowell.  The court first assigned him a base offense level of\n\n20 pursuant to U.S.S.G.   2K2.1(a)(4) (1993).  The court then\n\nadded the  following  nine  offense-level  increases:    four\n\nlevels  because  the possession  of  the  .44 took  place  in\n\nconnection   with   another   felony   offense,   i.e.,   the\n\nunjustifiable killing  of Stanley  Owens, see    2K2.1(b)(5);\r                                                         \n\none  level  because  Powell's  offense and  relevant  conduct\n\ninvolved  the possession  of  three firearms,  see  id. at   \r                                                                   \n\n2K2.1(b)(1); two levels  because one of  the firearms had  an\n\nobliterated  serial number, see id. at   2K2.1(b)(4); and two\r                                               \n\nlevels   because   Powell   obstructed  justice   by   giving\n\n\"perjurious\"  testimony,  see     3C1.1,  comment.  (n.3(b)).\r                                         \n\nThese increases led to a final  offense level of 29.  Because\n\nPowell had  a criminal history  category of V,  his guideline\n\nsentencing range was 140 to 175 months.  In view  of the ten-\n\nyear  statutory   maximum  applicable  to   the  offense   of\n\nconviction, see  18 U.S.C.    924(a)(2), the  court sentenced\r                           \n\nPowell to a 120-month term of imprisonment.  In so doing, the\n\ncourt rejected Powell's request for a downward departure from\n\nthe applicable  sentencing range because Powell  purported to\n\nhave committed the offense of conviction \"in order to avoid a\n\nperceived  greater harm.\"   See    5K2.11  (allowing downward\r                                           \n\ndepartures in some such situations).\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          Powell  makes six  arguments  on appeal:   (1)  the\n\ndistrict  court  committed  reversible  error   in  admitting\n\nevidence of  the guns  and ammunition  found in  the Fairlawn\n\nEstates apartment; (2)  the court committed  reversible error\n\nin permitting the government to impeach Powell with his prior\n\nfelony  convictions;  (3)  the   court  erred  in  increasing\n\nPowell's offense  level by  four on  the grounds that  Powell\n\npossessed the .44 in  connection with another felony offense;\n\n(4) the court erred  in increasing Powell's offense level  by\n\nthree for \"relevant conduct\"  that included the possession of\n\nthe guns  found in  the Fairlawn Estates  apartment; (5)  the\n\ncourt erred in  increasing Powell's offense level  by two for\n\nobstruction of justice; and (6) the court erred in  declining\n\nto depart downward.  We address each argument in turn.\n\nA.  Admission of the Evidence from the Fairlawn Estates      \r            A.  Admission of the Evidence from the Fairlawn Estates\r                                                                   \nApartment\r            Apartment\r                     \n\n          Powell's argument relating to the evidence from the\n\nFairlawn  Estates apartment  is  tripartite.   First,  Powell\n\ncontends that the  evidence is not relevant  because the jury\n\ncould  not reasonably  have concluded  that he  possessed the\n\nguns and  ammunition discovered  during the search.   Second,\n\nPowell asserts that the court erred in admitting the evidence\n\nunder Rule 404(b), even if the jury  could have found that he\n\npossessed  the guns  and ammunition.   Third,  Powell insists\n\nthat  the court erred in deciding that the probative value of\n\nthis evidence was not \"substantially outweighed by the danger\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nof unfair  prejudice, confusion of the  issues, or misleading\n\nthe jury,\"  see Fed. R. Evid.  403, even if  the evidence was\r                           \n\notherwise admissible.  In  light of the deference we  give to\n\nthe  challenged  district   court  rulings,  we   discern  no\n\nreversible error.\n\n          Because   the   court   conditioned    the   jury's\n\nconsideration of  the evidence found in  the Fairlawn Estates\n\napartment  upon  its  initially  finding possession  of  this\n\nevidence  by  Powell, the  first  part  of Powell's  argument\n\nimplicates  Fed.  R. Evid.  104(b).    Rule 104(b)  provides:\n\n\"When the relevancy of  evidence depends upon the fulfillment\n\nof a  condition of fact,  the court shall  admit it  upon, or\n\nsubject  to,  the  introduction  of  evidence  sufficient  to\n\nsupport a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.\"  Like\n\nother admissibility rulings,  the decision  whether there  is\n\nsufficient evidence  to support a finding  of the fulfillment\n\nof the  condition  is committed  to the  trial judge's  \"wide\n\ndiscretion.\"   See  Veranda  Beach Club  Ltd.

The court simply examines\n          all the evidence in the  case and decides\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          whether  the  jury could  reasonably find\n          the  conditional   fact  .   .  .  by   a\n          preponderance of the evidence.\n\nHuddleston  v. United States, 485  U.S. 681, 690  (1988).  We\r                                        \n\ntherefore  ask only  whether  the district  court abused  its\n\ndiscretion in  deciding that the jury  could reasonably find,\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence, that Powell possessed the\n\nTaurus and derringer.\n\n          Possession  of  firearms can  be  either  actual or\n\nconstructive.   See, e.g., United  States v. Rogers,  41 F.3d\r                                                               \n\n25,  29 (1st  Cir.  1994).   In  Rogers, we  approved  a jury\r                                                   \n\ninstruction which explained:  \n\n          \"A  person who,  although  not in  actual\n          possession, knowingly has both  the power\n          and  the intention  at  a  given time  to\n          exercise  dominion  or  control   over  a\n          thing, or to exercise dominion or control\n          over  the  area in  which  that thing  is\n          found,   whether   directly  or   through\n          another person, is  then in  constructive\n          possession of the thing.\"\n\nId.  at  30  (emphases omitted).

There was evidence\n\nthat Powell was  sharing the master  bedroom of the  Fairlawn\n\nEstates  apartment at the time  of the shooting;  that he had\n\nsigned  a variety of forms relating to the apartment; that he\n\nhad made a  request for  repairs to the  apartment; that  his\n\nname was  on the mailbox; that he was one of only two persons\n\nwith keys;  and that the  guns found there did  not belong to\n\nthe  apartment's other  primary  adult  resident --  Boykins.\n\nThis  evidence was more than  adequate for the  court to have\n\nallowed the jury  to consider  whether Powell  constructively\n\npossessed the  Taurus and  derringer that were  hidden within\n\nthe apartment.    All the  evidence tended  to show  Powell's\n\ndominion over the apartment in which the guns were found, and\n\nsome of it --  Boykins' testimony that the guns were not hers\n\n--  tended to show that  the guns were  Powell's (although we\n\nacknowledge Boykins' further testimony that the guns were not\n\nPowell's).  We therefore reject Powell's relevancy argument.\n\n          The second  and  third parts  of Powell's  argument\n\nagainst the  admissibility of the evidence  from the Fairlawn\n\nEstates  apartment do not fare any better.  In admitting this\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nevidence,  the  district  court  employed the  correct  legal\n\nanalysis.  The  court first determined that the  evidence had\n\n\"special  relevance\" to  material  issues raised  by Powell's\n\ncase  --  whether Powell  possessed  firearms  in the  months\n\npreceding the shoot-out, whether Powell had an opportunity to\n\nobtain  firearms,   whether  Powell  had  knowledge   of  the\n\navailability of firearms, and  whether Powell's possession of\n\nthe .44 was a question  of mere necessity -- and that  it was\n\nnot being  offered to  show Powell's character  or propensity\n\nfor criminal conduct.   See, e.g.,  United States v.  Tuesta-\r                                                                         \n\nToro, 29  F.3d  771, 775  (1st  Cir. 1994)  (explaining  Rule\r                \n\n404(b) inquiry), cert. denied, 115 S.

See id.   (citing Rule 403).   Because\r                                          \n\nlegal error  did not  infect the  trial court's analysis,  we\n\nafford the  court's conclusions considerable  deference.  See\r                                                                         \n\nid.; see also  United States v.

Although the\n\ncourt may have oversimplified a bit in asserting that defense\n\ncounsel had  asked Boykins whether  she'd seen Powell  with a\n\nweapon on  occasion, we think the  court permissibly admitted\n\nthe  challenged evidence  to  rebut  the implication  plainly\n\ninhering in Boykins's  testimony regarding the futile  police\n\nsearches  of Powell  in the  months preceding  the shoot-out:\n\nthat  Powell was not a  possessor of firearms  at the time of\n\nthe shooting.   We  think that the  challenged evidence  bore\n\nspecial  relevance  to  whether  Powell only  came  into  the\n\npossession of the .44 as a matter of necessity, or whether he\n\nwas armed at the time the shooting began.  \n\n          As we have just stated, Powell attempted to bolster\n\nhis  necessity defense  by  introducing evidence  -- his  and\n\nBoykins' testimony -- suggesting that he was  not a possessor\n\nof firearms at the  time of the  shoot-out.  In other  words,\n\nPowell  introduced  evidence that  he  did  not commit  other\r                                                           \n\nsimilar acts at the relevant point in time.  While other-acts\n\nevidence is not generally  admissible \"to prove the character\n\nof a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,\"\n\nsee  Rule 404(b),  it is  admissible to  rebut a  defendant's\r                                                                       \n\naffirmative claim that s/he did not commit other similar acts\n\nat the relevant point in time.  See, e.g., Wood,  982 F.2d at\r                                                           \n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n4 (\"rebuttal  evidence may  be introduced to  explain, repel,\n\ncontradict  or  disprove  an  adversary's  proof\")  (citation\n\nomitted); see  also United  States v.  Zarnes, 33  F.3d 1454,\r                                                         \n\n1470 (7th Cir. 1994) (evidence of marijuana plants growing in\n\ndefendant's vegetable garden admissible to  rebut defendant's\n\nmother's testimony that there were no marijuana plants in the\n\ngarden).  The  court therefore  did not err  in allowing  the\n\njury   to   consider    whether   Powell's    contemporaneous\n\nconstructive  possession  of  the  weapons  in  the  Fairlawn\n\nEstates apartment tended to  show that his possession  of the\n\n.44 \"was not a question of mere necessity.\"  \n\n          Finally,  the  court's  careful   and  well-crafted\n\nlimiting instruction -- which told the jury that the evidence\n\nwas not admissible to show that Powell was the kind of person\n\nwho possessed  firearms -- largely dissipates  any concern we\n\nmight have  had  about  the danger  of  unfair  prejudice  to\r                                                          \n\nPowell.   Simply put, we see no reason why the jury could not\n\nhave followed the court's instruction in this case.  \n\n          We  therefore reject  Powell's  argument  that  the\n\nadmission of the evidence from the Fairlawn Estates apartment\n\nran afoul of Rules 404(b) and 403.\n\nB.

In Tavares,  we held that  if a defendant  wishes to\r                               \n\nstipulate to  the second  of these three  elements, \"evidence\n\nbeyond  the  fact of  the  prior  conviction is  inadmissible\n\nabsent adequate trial court  findings that its  noncumulative\n\nrelevance is sufficiently compelling to survive the balancing\n\ntest of Fed.

Four-Level  Increase for  Possession in  Connection with\r                                                                         \nAnother Felony Offense\r            Another Felony Offense\r                                  \n\n          The   district  court  found   at  sentencing  that\n\nPowell's possession  of the  .44 was committed  in connection\n\nwith  another felony  offense --  the unjustified  killing of\n\nStanley Owens.  The court explained its finding as follows:\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n               I  find,  first, that  the defendant\n          was  engaged  in activity  which involved\n          him in an unjustified homicide.  I do not\n          credit   the  defendant's   testimony  --\n          indeed, I find it to have been perjurious\n          --  as to  the manner  in which  he found\n          himself  in  possession  of  the  firearm\n          here.    Accordingly,  I  find  that  the\n          defendant  was  in   possession  of   the\n          firearm in connection with another felony\n          offense, an  unjustifiable homicide under\n          state  law.   I  will  not  get into  the\n          particulars  of  how that  may  have been\n          charged under  state law, what  degree of\n          murder or manslaughter, simply that there\n          was  no defense  of self-defense.   There\n          was  no defense of  necessity.  There was\n          no  defense  for  the  defense  of  other\n          persons,  but  rather that  the defendant\n          chose to place himself in the middle of a\n          shootout   in  which  he   chose  not  to\n          withdraw, but to engage.\n\nThe court therefore increased Powell's offense level by four.\n\nSee    2K2.1(b)(5).    Powell takes  issue  with the  court's\r               \n\nfinding, arguing that  there was no  evidence to support  it.\n\nWe do not agree with Powell's argument.\n\n          The standard by which  we review a district court's\n\napplication of a sentencing guideline depends upon the nature\n\nof the challenge before us.   If a party claims error  in the\n\ncourt's interpretation of a guideline's meaning or scope, our\n\nreview  is plenary.  E.g., United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d\r                                                                \n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994).  If  a party assigns error to a factual\n\nfinding made at sentencing,  we review the finding for  clear\n\nerror.  See id. at 4-5.  In so doing, we ask only whether the\r                           \n\ncourt clearly erred in finding that the government proved the\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\ndisputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.  See United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir. 1989).\r                              \n\n          It  is  important  to  note that  Powell  does  not\n\nchallenge  the trial  court's apparent legal  conclusion that\n\nthe killing of Stanley  Owens was necessarily unjustified if,\r                                                         \n\nas  the court found, Powell placed himself into the middle of\n\nthe shoot-out  instead of  withdrawing.  Cf.  Commonwealth v.\r                                                                      \n\nKendrick,  218 N.E.2d 408,  414 (Mass.  1966) (\"The  right of\r                    \n\nself-defence does not accrue to a person until he has availed\n\nall  proper means to avoid physical combat.\").  In his brief,\n\nPowell questions only the  factual finding itself (along with\n\nthe statement  that \"there  was no defense  of self-defense,\"\n\nwhich he treats as a separate finding), asserting that  there\n\nwas  no  evidentiary  basis  to support  the  court's  upward\n\nadjustment.   We therefore will not  review the trial court's\n\nlegal conclusion, and  will look only to whether the outcome-\n\ndeterminative finding  -- that Powell chose  to place himself\n\nin  the middle of the shoot-out instead of withdrawing -- was\n\nclearly erroneous.  We think that it was not.\n\n          Central  to  our  decision  is  the  court's  tacit\n\ndetermination that Powell knew of the possibility of a shoot-\n\nout  prior  to  its  taking  place.    Especially  given  the\n\napplicable   preponderance-of-the-evidence   standard,   this\n\ndetermination is  sustainable.  Immediately  after seeing the\n\nhooded  men  in  the  Subaru  and  hearing  the  car  rapidly\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\naccelerate in  reverse, Powell insisted that  Boykins and her\n\nmother get  out of  the area  as quickly as  possible.   This\n\ngives rise to  an inference that Powell  knew serious trouble\n\nmight  ensue.  Moreover, Powell conceded on cross-examination\n\nthat he thought  the men in the Subaru were gang members, and\n\nthat he knew there had been at least one shooting in the area\n\nin the previous week. \n\n          Also  important  to our  conclusion is  the court's\n\nfinding that  Powell possessed the .44 prior to the inception\n\nof  the shoot-out (a finding which is implicit in the court's\n\nstated disbelief of  Powell's testimony \"as to the  manner in\n\nwhich he found  himself in possession of  the firearm here\").\n\nThis finding, too, is  sustainable.  Powell's trial testimony\n\nas to  how he came to  possess the .44 not  only contradicted\n\nthe accounts  he gave to  an arresting officer  shortly after\n\nthe shoot-out, but it also was inherently improbable.  Powell\n\ntestified  that,  instead  of  taking  cover  inside Humboldt\n\nLiquors with Cheney and  Rhodes when shots unexpectedly began\n\nto ring out (as one might have expected him to  do), he began\n\nrunning and (1) continued to run up the  street towards a man\n\nwho had come around the corner and was pointing a gun at him;\n\n(2) closed the  distance between the  man and himself  before\n\nthe  man could fire a shot;  (3) disarmed the man, seized his\n\ngun, and chased  him off; and (4) turned on  the run and shot\n\nand  twice hit an assailant who allegedly was shooting at him\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nfrom behind.  The  implausibility of this testimony  alone is\n\nsufficient  to  ground the  court's  contrary  finding.   Cf.\r                                                                         \n\nUnited  States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 999 (1st Cir. 1990)\r                                      \n\n(implausibility of a defendant's testimony can be affirmative\n\nevidence  of  guilt),  cert.  denied, 500  U.S.  936  (1991).\r                                                \n\nFurthermore, there  was hearsay evidence in  the Pre-Sentence\n\nReport  indicating that  a  confidential  informant had  seen\n\nPowell  with the  .44  prior to  the  shooting.   Though  not\n\nintroduced  at  trial, this  evidence  was  available to  the\n\ndistrict court at sentencing.  See  United States v. Tardiff,\r                                                                        \n\n969  F.2d 1283,  1287  (1st Cir.  1992)  (court may  rely  on\n\nhearsay evidence at sentencing). \n\n          What  we have,  then, is an  armed Powell  not only\n\nremaining  at  a  location  where he  knows  a  shoot-out  is\n\npossible,  but also seeking out the two young men (Cheney and\n\nRhodes)  who were involved in  the initial confrontation -- a\n\nconfrontation that prompted Powell to insist that Boykins and\n\nher  mother  leave the  area immediately.    In view  of this\n\nfactual scenario, we cannot say that  the court clearly erred\n\nin  finding that  \"defendant chose  to  place himself  in the\n\nmiddle of a shootout  in which he chose not  to withdraw, but\n\nto  engage.\"   For the  reasons stated  above, this  ends our\n\ninquiry.\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\n          We  therefore  reject  Powell's  challenge  to  the\n\ndistrict  court's  finding  that  the .44  was  possessed  in\n\nconnection with another felony offense.\n\nD.   Three-Level Increase for Possession of the Guns Found in\r            D.   Three-Level Increase for Possession of the Guns Found in\r                                                                         \nthe Fairlawn Estates Apartment\r            the Fairlawn Estates Apartment\r                                          \n\n          The district court found at sentencing  that Powell\n\npossessed the  guns found in the  Fairlawn Estates apartment.\n\nIt  therefore increased  Powell's  offense level  by one  for\n\npossession of the guns, see   2K2.1(b)(1), and by two because\r                                       \n\none  of  the guns  had an  obliterated  serial number,  see  \r                                                                       \n\n2K2.1(b)(4).  Powell challenges  this finding on two grounds.\n\nFirst, he  contends that  there was insufficient  evidence to\n\nsupport the finding.  Second, he asserts  that his possession\n\nof these guns was not \"part  of the same course of conduct or\n\ncommon  scheme or plan as  the offense of  conviction,\" as is\n\nrequired  by   1B1.3(a)(2).  We are not persuaded by Powell's\n\narguments.\n\n          As we  already have  explained, the  district court\n\ndid  not abuse its discretion in deciding that the jury could\n\nfind,  by a preponderance of  the evidence, that  the guns in\n\nthe Fairlawn Estates apartment were possessed by Powell.  See\r                                                                         \n\nsupra  Section II-A.   While  fine semantic  distinctions may\r                 \n\nmake it  theoretically possible  for a  court  to have  acted\n\nwithin the bounds of  its discretion in deciding that  a jury\n\ncould make a preponderant finding, and then to have committed\n\nclear error  in making the same  preponderant finding itself,\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nwe are confident that this is not such a case.   We therefore\n\nrely  on  our  earlier  explanation  in   rejecting  Powell's\n\nsufficiency argument.\n\n          Although Powell's \"same course of conduct\" argument\n\nhas some superficial  appeal --  after all, the  guns in  the\n\nFairlawn  Estates apartment  did  not play  any  role in  the\n\nPowell's  possession of the .44  on Humboldt Avenue  -- it is\n\nforeclosed  by  circuit  precedent.    In  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \n\nSanders,  982 F.2d 4 (1st  Cir. 1992), we  analyzed whether a\r                   \n\ndefendant  who  had  pleaded  guilty  to  being  a  felon  in\n\npossession  of a firearm and  to using or  carrying a firearm\n\nduring and in relation  to a drug trafficking crime  could be\n\nsubjected  to an  upward  departure for  possessing a  weapon\n\n(used  to shoot  his girlfriend  in the  head) which  was not\n\nnamed in the  indictment.  See  982 F.2d at 9-10.   Answering\r                                          \n\nthis  question required us to consider the scope of the \"same\n\ncourse of  conduct provision\"  in   1B1.3(a)(2),  because the\n\npossession  of the  gun used  in the  shooting could  only be\n\ntaken into  account at sentencing if  it constituted relevant\n\nconduct under    1B1.3.  Id. at 9.  In answering the question\r                                        \n\nin the affirmative, we said:  \n\n               The \"same course of conduct\" concept\n          looks  to  whether the  defendant repeats\n          the  same type of  criminal activity over\n          time.   It does not require  that acts be\n          connected together by common participants\n          or by an overall scheme.  Here, defendant\n          did  repeat the  same  type  of  criminal\n          activity -- he illegally  possessed three\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n          or four separate firearms when the victim\n          was shot.   We have no difficulty viewing\n          the  illegal  possession   of  the   four\n          weapons as all part of the same course of\n          conduct.\n\nId. at 9-10 (citation, ellipses, and internal quotation marks\r               \n\nomitted).   In  other words,  the contemporaneous,  or nearly\n\ncontemporaneous, possession of uncharged firearms is, in this\n\ncircuit,  relevant  conduct in  the  context  of a  felon-in-\n\npossession prosecution.  See id.\r                                            \n\n          In this case, Powell  clearly possessed the guns in\n\nthe  Fairlawn  Estates apartment  at  the same  time  that he\n\npossessed the  .44 used  in the shooting.   Accordingly,  the\n\ndistrict  court did not err in finding that the possession of\n\nthese weapons was part of  the same course of conduct  as the\n\noffense of conviction.\n\n          We  therefore  reject  Powell's  challenge  to  the\n\ncourt's  three-level  increase  for  the guns  found  in  the\n\nFairlawn Estates apartment.      \n\nE.  Two-Level Increase for Obstruction of Justice\r            E.

The court therefore  increased Powell's offense\n\nlevel  by two  for  obstruction of  justice.   See     3C1.1.\r                                                              \n\nPowell challenges  this finding  on two  grounds.   First, he\n\ncontends that it was  not accompanied by necessary subsidiary\n\nfindings that the false  testimony was \"concerning a material\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nmatter\" and given \"with  the willful intent to  provide false\n\ntestimony,  rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or\n\nfaulty  memory.\"  See United  States v. Dunnigan,  113 S. Ct.\r                                                            \n\n1111,  1116 (1993).    Second, he  asserts  that it  was  not\n\nsupported by  the evidence.  We need not and do not reach the\n\nmerits  of  Powell's arguments  (though  we  observe that  we\n\nalready have found there to be sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe district court's  implicit finding that Powell  possessed\n\nthe .44 prior to the shoot-out.  See supra Section II-C.). \r                                                      \n\n          Because we  have affirmed each of  the other upward\n\nadjustments  imposed  by  the  sentencing  court,  see  supra\r                                                                         \n\nSections II-C  and II-D),  Powell's 120-month sentence  would\n\nremain unchanged even if we were to find error in the court's\n\ntwo-level  obstruction enhancement.   Reducing  Powell's base\n\noffense level by two  would still give him a  guideline range\n\nof  120-150  months.   Thus,  the sentencing  court  would be\n\nwithout the power to give him a  lower sentence than the 120-\n\nmonth term of imprisonment he actually received.\n\n          We  therefore decline to address Powell's challenge\n\nto the district court's finding that he obstructed justice by\n\ngiving perjurious testimony.\n\nF.

The  court\r                                                 \n\nexplained its decision as follows:\n\n               And with respect to objection number\n          31, I understand that  to be the argument\n          made by the  defendant here for  downward\n          departure in this case.   I must indicate\n          that  the  defendant's actions  here were\n          not those of a good samaritan  seeking to\n          protect  the community  and the  lives of\n          other persons and it  strikes me as not a\n          grounds [sic] for  downward departure  in\n          this setting.\n\nWhile acknowledging  that we  have no jurisdiction  to review\n\ndiscretionary refusals to depart  downward, see, e.g., United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1345 (1st Cir. 1994) (court of\r                           \n\nappeals lacks jurisdiction to review district court's refusal\n\nto  depart downward  so  long  as  court  was  aware  of  its\n\nauthority to do so),  Powell seizes on the court's use of the\n\nterm \"good samaritan\"  and asserts that  the court failed  to\n\nunderstand that  it could  depart if it  found that  Powell's\n\npossession  of the firearm was prompted by the need for self-\r                                                                        \n\npreservation.  Powell's argument is unconvincing.\n\n          As we have  already explained,  the district  court\n\nclearly  believed that Powell possessed the  .44 prior to the\n\ninception  of the shoot-out.

Sec. 922(g)(1).  He was then sentenced to the statutory maximum of 120 months' imprisonment.  Powell challenges his conviction and sentence on a variety of grounds.  After carefully reading the record and considering Powell's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>A. General Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At shortly after 2:00 p.m. on October 7, 1992, Powell was standing outside of his truck.  He was holding food and conversing with Arvetta Boykins--his girlfriend--and Boykins' mother as the two women sat in the truck.  The truck was parked on Boston's Humboldt Avenue near its intersection with Ruthven Street and across from Humboldt Liquors.  As this conversation was taking place, a grayish-silver Subaru drove slowly down Ruthven and turned onto Humboldt.  There were four young men in the Subaru, each of whom was wearing a hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Subaru proceeded down Humboldt, the men in the car yelled something to a couple of young men--Chris Cheney and Ernest Rhodes--who were standing out on Humboldt.  Either Rhodes or Cheney yelled back.  After this exchange, the driver of the Subaru put the car in reverse and accelerated quickly, making a loud screeching sound.  Observing this, Powell handed his food to his girlfriend's mother and told the two women to \"get out of here.\"   Knowing that trouble was brewing, they quickly complied by driving off.  Powell then ran up Ruthven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By about 2:30 p.m., Powell had returned to Humboldt Avenue and was talking with Cheney and Rhodes in front of Humboldt Liquors.  Around this same time, Stanley Owens came around the corner of Ruthven and Humboldt on a mountain bike.  He had his hand in his jacket pocket and was leaning to his left.  At least one other youth also came on the scene simultaneously.  At some point, gunfire erupted.  The gunfire, which came from at least three guns, was continuous and lasted six or more seconds.  Three persons, including Powell, were wounded in the shoot-out;  Owens was killed.  Cheney and Rhodes escaped injury by taking cover inside of Humboldt Liquors.  Within an hour of the shooting, Powell was arrested.  At the time of his arrest, Powell was standing in an alley not far from the intersection of Ruthven and Humboldt, and was holding a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog handgun.  He also had a walking cane with him.  It was subsequently determined that a bullet from the .44 had killed Owens.  Powell does not dispute that he fired two shots with the .44 during the shoot-out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Necessity Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government argued that Powell shot Owens with a gun he had brought to the crime scene.  Powell consistently denied this, asserting as an affirmative defense that he took possession of the .44 only out of necessity in the midst of the shoot-out.  When he was in an ambulance after the shooting, Powell told an arresting officer that the youths in the gray Subaru had started shooting from the car, that a light-skinned black male had alighted and continued the shooting, that he (Powell) ran towards this shooter, and that the shooter then lost control of the weapon, dropped it to the ground, and jumped back into the Subaru, which sped off.  Powell stated that he picked up the gun and ran to the alley in which he was arrested.  He did not mention firing the weapon at anyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To clarify how the shooter lost control of the weapon, the officer asked Powell to repeat his story.  At this point, Powell told the officer that the light-skinned male got out of the Subaru, began the shooting, and fled on foot.  He did not mention the shooter dropping or losing control of his weapon.  When the officer asked how the weapon ended upon the ground, Powell did not answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Powell had a third account of what had happened.  Powell testified that he heard shots ring out as he stood in front of Humboldt Liquors talking with Cheney and Rhodes.  While Cheney and Rhodes sought refuge inside the store, Powell began running up the street towards the intersection of Humboldt and Ruthven.  Just then, a man who was pulling a gun out of his pocket came running around the corner.  The man pointed the gun at him, but was unable to fire it before Powell was upon him.  The two scuffled, and the gun fell to the ground.  The man fled around the corner and Powell picked up the gun.  Powell began to run across Ruthven and was shot in the leg.  He turned around and fired two shots at his assailant.  He then ran up Humboldt to Homestead Street, turned left on Homestead, and headed into an alley, where he found a walking cane.  He stayed in the alley until he was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Guns</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the shooting, an arresting officer retrieved a set of keys from Powell.  The keys were to a two-bedroom apartment at Fairlawn Estates in the Mattapan section of Boston.  The police obtained a search warrant for the apartment, and executed the warrant the same night as the shooting.  The search turned up two additional weapons:  a fully-loaded black Taurus 9 mm. semi-automatic pistol with an obliterated serial number;  and a .38 caliber derringer loaded with two rounds of ammunition.  The Taurus was hidden in a laundry basket located in the apartment's master bedroom.  The derringer was hidden on a closet shelf in the second bedroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Powell claimed to be nothing more than a sporadic visitor to the Fairlawn Estates apartment, the evidence, taken in a light most favorable to the government, established that Powell and Boykins (Powell's girlfriend) were living there at the time of the shooting.  Powell and Boykins had signed a rental application, lease, lease addendum, and rules and regulations acknowledgment for the apartment in August, 1992.  Moreover, Boykins told the grand jury that she and Powell (along with their two children) were living in the apartment, and that she and Powell shared the master bedroom.  This testimony was introduced at trial.  Finally, the evidence showed that Powell's name was on the mailbox for the apartment;  that only Powell and Boykins had keys to the apartment;  that Powell had personally visited the Fairlawn Estates apartment manager's office on at least two occasions in the months prior to the shooting;  and that Powell had once telephoned the apartment manager and made an oral request that repairs be made to the apartment.  Boykins testified that Powell's cousin and her children also were staying at the apartment around the time of the shooting.  Powell testified that his cousin's husband was staying there as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 1992, the grand jury returned a three-count indictment against Powell.  Count I charged him with being a felon unlawfully in possession of the .44 used in the shooting.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1).  Count II charged him with being a felon unlawfully in possession of the Taurus pistol, the derringer, and the ammunition found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment.  See id.   Count III charged him with unlawfully possessing a firearm--the Taurus--with an obliterated serial number.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(k).  Prior to trial, the district court severed Counts II and III from the trial of Count I.  The court also granted Powell's motion in limine requesting that the government not be allowed to refer to the firearms and ammunition which were the subjects of Counts II and III during its opening statement or case-in-chief.  The court did, however, reserve judgment as to whether evidence relating to Counts II and III might become admissible after the defense put on its case.  The government complied with the court's order and did not allude to this evidence at any point during its case-in-chief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense called Arvetta Boykins as a witness.  She testified, in response to a question by defense counsel, that numerous random police searches of Powell in the months preceding the shoot-out had failed to turn up a weapon on his person or in his car.  The government then asked the court to revisit its ruling in limine.   At this point, the court allowed the government to cross-examine Boykins about whether she or Powell had stored in the Fairlawn Estates apartment the firearms described in Counts II and III of the indictment.  The court ruled that defense counsel had \"opened the door\" to this inquiry by asking Boykins whether \"she's seen him with a weapon on occasion.\"   Defense counsel, who had asked only about police searches of Powell in the months preceding the shoot-out, denied having asked such a question.  Boykins denied that the firearms were hers or Powell's.  After Boykins completed her testimony, Powell himself took the stand and asserted, inter alia, that he had never had a firearm on him in the summer of 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the court permitted the government to introduce the evidence underlying Counts II and III as part of its rebuttal case.  The court informed the jury that it should not consider the firearms found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment at all unless it first found that Powell possessed them.  The court also told the jury that, if it found that Powell did possess these firearms, it should not consider this evidence \"to show that the defendant was the kind of person who possessed firearms, but rather to show that the defendant had an opportunity to obtain firearms, that the defendant had knowledge of the availability of firearms, that [his possession of the .44] was not a question of mere necessity.\"   See Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).  The jury convicted Powell of the crime alleged in Count I of the indictment.  The government thereafter dismissed the severed Counts, II and III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 29, 1994, the district court sentenced Powell.  The court first assigned him a base offense level of 20 pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(a)(4) (1993).  The court then added the following nine offense-level increases:  four levels because the possession of the .44 took place in connection with another felony offense, i.e., the unjustifiable killing of Stanley Owens, see Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5);  one level because Powell's offense and relevant conduct involved the possession of three firearms, see id. at Sec. 2K2.1(b)(1);  two levels because one of the firearms had an obliterated serial number, see id. at Sec. 2K2.1(b)(4);  and two levels because Powell obstructed justice by giving \"perjurious\" testimony, see Sec. 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 3(b)).  These increases led to a final offense level of 29.  Because Powell had a criminal history category of V, his guideline sentencing range was 140 to 175 months.  In view of the ten-year statutory maximum applicable to the offense of conviction, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(a)(2), the court sentenced Powell to a 120-month term of imprisonment.  In so doing, the court rejected Powell's request for a downward departure from the applicable sentencing range because Powell purported to have committed the offense of conviction \"in order to avoid a perceived greater harm.\"   See Sec. 5K2.11 (allowing downward departures in some such situations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Powell makes six arguments on appeal:  (1) the district court committed reversible error in admitting evidence of the guns and ammunition found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment;  (2) the court committed reversible error in permitting the government to impeach Powell with his prior felony convictions;  (3) the court erred in increasing Powell's offense level by four on the grounds that Powell possessed the .44 in connection with another felony offense;  (4) the court erred in increasing Powell's offense level by three for \"relevant conduct\" that included the possession of the guns found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment;  (5) the court erred in increasing Powell's offense level by two for obstruction of justice;  and (6) the court erred in declining to depart downward.  We address each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>A. Admission of the Evidence from the Fairlawn Estates Apartment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Powell's argument relating to the evidence from the Fairlawn Estates apartment is tripartite.  First, Powell contends that the evidence is not relevant because the jury could not reasonably have concluded that he possessed the guns and ammunition discovered during the search.  Second, Powell asserts that the court erred in admitting the evidence under Rule 404(b), even if the jury could have found that he possessed the guns and ammunition.  Third, Powell insists that the court erred in deciding that the probative value of this evidence was not \"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury,\" see Fed.R.Evid. 403, even if the evidence was otherwise admissible.  In light of the deference we give to the challenged district court rulings, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the court conditioned the jury's consideration of the evidence found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment upon its initially finding possession of this evidence by Powell, the first part of Powell's argument implicates Fed.R.Evid. 104(b).  Rule 104(b) provides:  \"When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.\"   Like other admissibility rulings, the decision whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition is committed to the trial judge's \"wide discretion.\"   See Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1371 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has set forth the process by which the trial court should make this decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>In determining whether the Government has introduced sufficient evidence to meet Rule 104(b), the trial court neither weighs credibility nor makes a finding that the Government has proved the conditional fact by a preponderance of the evidence.  The court simply examines all the evidence in the case and decides whether the jury could reasonably find the conditional fact ... by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 690, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 1501, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988).  We therefore ask only whether the district court abused its discretion in deciding that the jury could reasonably find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Powell possessed the Taurus and derringer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Possession of firearms can be either actual or constructive.  See, e.g., United States v. Rogers, 41 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.1994).  In Rogers, we approved a jury instruction which explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>\"A person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing, or to exercise dominion or control over the area in which that thing is found, whether directly or through another person, is then in constructive possession of the thing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 30 (emphases omitted).  Thus, so long as one's dominion/control over the area containing the thing at the relevant time is established, \"one can possess an object while it is hidden at home in a bureau drawer, or while held by an agent, or even while it is secured in a safe deposit box at the bank and can be retrieved only when a bank official opens the vault.\"  United States v. Zavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d 4, 7 (1st Cir.)  (interpreting scope of a drug possession statute), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 451, 130 L.Ed.2d 360 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of this broad understanding of \"possession\" and the applicable preponderance standard, see Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 690, 108 S.Ct. at 1501-02, we have little difficulty concluding that there was no abuse of discretion here.  There was evidence that Powell was sharing the master bedroom of the Fairlawn Estates apartment at the time of the shooting;  that he had signed a variety of forms relating to the apartment;  that he had made a request for repairs to the apartment;  that his name was on the mailbox;  that he was one of only two persons with keys;  and that the guns found there did not belong to the apartment's other primary adult resident--Boykins.  This evidence was more than adequate for the court to have allowed the jury to consider whether Powell constructively possessed the Taurus and derringer that were hidden within the apartment.  All the evidence tended to show Powell's dominion over the apartment in which the guns were found, and some of it--Boykins' testimony that the guns were not hers--tended to show that the guns were Powell's (although we acknowledge Boykins' further testimony that the guns were not Powell's).  We therefore reject Powell's relevancy argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third parts of Powell's argument against the admissibility of the evidence from the Fairlawn Estates apartment do not fare any better.  In admitting this evidence, the district court employed the correct legal analysis.  The court first determined that the evidence had \"special relevance\" to material issues raised by Powell's case--whether Powell possessed firearms in the months preceding the shoot-out, whether Powell had an opportunity to obtain firearms, whether Powell had knowledge of the availability of firearms, and whether Powell's possession of the .44 was a question of mere necessity--and that it was not being offered to show Powell's character or propensity for criminal conduct.  See, e.g., United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771, 775 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining Rule 404(b) inquiry), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then decided that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  See id.  (citing Rule 403).  Because legal error did not infect the trial court's analysis, we afford the court's conclusions considerable deference.  See id.;   see also United States v. Guyon, 27 F.3d 723, 729 (1st Cir.1994) (trial court's Rule 404(b) ruling reversible only if the court abused its discretion);  Veranda Beach Club, 936 F.2d at 1372 (trial court's construction of Rule 403's probative value/unfair prejudice balance subject to substantial deference on appeal);  United States v. Wood, 982 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1992) (decision whether to permit the introduction of rebuttal evidence is within sound discretion of the trial judge).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, we see no abuse of discretion.  Although the court may have oversimplified a bit in asserting that defense counsel had asked Boykins whether she'd seen Powell with a weapon on occasion, we think the court permissibly admitted the challenged evidence to rebut the implication plainly inhering in Boykins's testimony regarding the futile police searches of Powell in the months preceding the shoot-out:  that Powell was not a possessor of firearms at the time of the shooting.  We think that the challenged evidence bore special relevance to whether Powell only came into the possession of the .44 as a matter of necessity, or whether he was armed at the time the shooting began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have just stated, Powell attempted to bolster his necessity defense by introducing evidence--his and Boykins' testimony--suggesting that he was not a possessor of firearms at the time of the shoot-out.  In other words, Powell introduced evidence that he did not commit other similar acts at the relevant point in time.  While other-acts evidence is not generally admissible \"to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,\" see Rule 404(b), it is admissible to rebut a defendant 's affirmative claim that s/he did not commit other similar acts at the relevant point in time.  See, e.g., Wood, 982 F.2d at 4 (\"rebuttal evidence may be introduced to explain, repel, contradict or disprove an adversary's proof\") (citation omitted);  see also United States v. Zarnes, 33 F.3d 1454, 1470 (7th Cir.1994) (evidence of marijuana plants growing in defendant's vegetable garden admissible to rebut defendant's mother's testimony that there were no marijuana plants in the garden).  The court therefore did not err in allowing the jury to consider whether Powell's contemporaneous constructive possession of the weapons in the Fairlawn Estates apartment tended to show that his possession of the .44 \"was not a question of mere necessity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court's careful and well-crafted limiting instruction--which told the jury that the evidence was not admissible to show that Powell was the kind of person who possessed firearms--largely dissipates any concern we might have had about the danger of unfair prejudice to Powell.  Simply put, we see no reason why the jury could not have followed the court's instruction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject Powell's argument that the admission of the evidence from the Fairlawn Estates apartment ran afoul of Rules 404(b) and 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>B. Impeachment of Powell with his Prior Felony Convictions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Powell next complains that the government's use of the number of his prior felony convictions for impeachment purposes (including its reference to the fact that, in one of these cases, Powell was convicted under a different name in another session of the district court) amounts to reversible error.  Citing United States v. Tavares, 21 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1994) (en banc), Powell claims that his willingness to stipulate to the fact that he had been convicted of a felony should have precluded the government from pursuing this line of questioning.  Powell misreads Tavares and overlooks Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conviction under Sec. 922(g)(1) requires proof of three elements:  (1) that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm;  (2) that the defendant had \"been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" at the time of the possession;  and (3) that the possession was in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.  United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 187, 191 (1st Cir.1994).  In Tavares, we held that if a defendant wishes to stipulate to the second of these three elements, \"evidence beyond the fact of the prior conviction is inadmissible absent adequate trial court findings that its noncumulative relevance is sufficiently compelling to survive the balancing test of Fed.R.Evid. 403.\"  21 F.3d at 5.   Thus, if there is such a stipulation in a Sec. 922(g)(1) prosecution, the government ordinarily may not introduce evidence of the nature or number of prior convictions as part of its case-in-chief.  See id. at 5-6.   We were careful to point out in Tavares, however, that \"in some cases evidence concerning the nature of the prior conviction will be admissible for impeachment or other reasons, despite its lack of probative value on the prior element of the crime.\"  Id. at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government did not introduce evidence of the number of Powell's prior felony convictions in order to prove an element of its case;  it introduced this evidence to impeach Powell after he took the stand in his own defense.  We recently have made clear what we implied in Tavares:  that Tavares does not control in the impeachment context.  See Tracy, 36 F.3d at 191-92.   Rather, the admissibility of the impeachment evidence must be evaluated under Rule 609(a)(1).  This Rule provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">General Rule.   For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, ... evidence that a witness other than an accused has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403, if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, and evidence that an accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot is that the evidence at issue was properly admitted absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect to Powell.  See Tracy, 36 F.3d at 193 (\"We review a district court's probative value/prejudicial effect decision under Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(1) for abuse of discretion.\").  Powell has not argued that there was an abuse of discretion here;  he has asserted only that Tavares is controlling.  Our own independent review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion by the district court.  Indeed, allowing the government only to inquire into the number, and not the nature, of Powell's prior felony convictions strikes us as an eminently fair way to balance the government's interest in impeaching Powell with Powell's interest in avoiding the \"unique risk of prejudice\" present whenever a testifying defendant is impeached with evidence of his/her prior convictions:  \"the danger that convictions that would be excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 404 will be misused by a jury as propensity evidence despite their introduction solely for impeachment purposes.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 609 advisory committee's note, 1990 amendment;  see also Tracy, 36 F.3d at 192.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject Powell's claim of reversible error in the introduction of this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>C. Four-Level Increase for Possession in Connection with Another Felony Offense</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found at sentencing that Powell's possession of the .44 was committed in connection with another felony offense--the unjustified killing of Stanley Owens.  The court explained its finding as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find, first, that the defendant was engaged in activity which involved him in an unjustified homicide.  I do not credit the defendant's testimony--indeed, I find it to have been perjurious--as to the manner in which he found himself in possession of the firearm here.  Accordingly, I find that the defendant was in possession of the firearm in connection with another felony offense, an unjustifiable homicide under state law.  I will not get into the particulars of how that may have been charged under state law, what degree of murder or manslaughter, simply that there was no defense of self-defense.  There was no defense of necessity.  There was no defense for the defense of other persons, but rather that the defendant chose to place himself in the middle of a shootout in which he chose not to withdraw, but to engage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court therefore increased Powell's offense level by four.  See Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5).  Powell takes issue with the court's finding, arguing that there was no evidence to support it.  We do not agree with Powell's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard by which we review a district court's application of a sentencing guideline depends upon the nature of the challenge before us.  If a party claims error in the court's interpretation of a guideline's meaning or scope, our review is plenary.  E.g., United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994).  If a party assigns error to a factual finding made at sentencing, we review the finding for clear error.  See id. at 4-5.   In so doing, we ask only whether the court clearly erred in finding that the government proved the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.  See United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to note that Powell does not challenge the trial court's apparent legal conclusion that the killing of Stanley Owens was necessarily unjustified if, as the court found, Powell placed himself into the middle of the shoot-out instead of withdrawing.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Kendrick, 351 Mass. 203, 218 N.E.2d 408, 414 (1966) (\"The right of self-defence does not accrue to a person until he has availed all proper means to avoid physical combat.\").  In his brief, Powell questions only the factual finding itself (along with the statement that \"there was no defense of self-defense,\" which he treats as a separate finding), asserting that there was no evidentiary basis to support the court's upward adjustment.  We therefore will not review the trial court's legal conclusion, and will look only to whether the outcome-determinative finding--that Powell chose to place himself in the middle of the shoot-out instead of withdrawing--was clearly erroneous.  We think that it was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central to our decision is the court's tacit determination that Powell knew of the possibility of a shoot-out prior to its taking place.  Especially given the applicable preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, this determination is sustainable.  Immediately after seeing the hooded men in the Subaru and hearing the car rapidly accelerate in reverse, Powell insisted that Boykins and her mother get out of the area as quickly as possible.  This gives rise to an inference that Powell knew serious trouble might ensue.  Moreover, Powell conceded on cross-examination that he thought the men in the Subaru were gang members, and that he knew there had been at least one shooting in the area in the previous week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also important to our conclusion is the court's finding that Powell possessed the .44 prior to the inception of the shoot-out (a finding which is implicit in the court's stated disbelief of Powell's testimony \"as to the manner in which he found himself in possession of the firearm here\").  This finding, too, is sustainable.  Powell's trial testimony as to how he came to possess the .44 not only contradicted the accounts he gave to an arresting officer shortly after the shoot-out, but it also was inherently improbable.  Powell testified that, instead of taking cover inside Humboldt Liquors with Cheney and Rhodes when shots unexpectedly began to ring out (as one might have expected him to do), he began running and (1) continued to run up the street towards a man who had come around the corner and was pointing a gun at him;  (2) closed the distance between the man and himself before the man could fire a shot;  (3) disarmed the man, seized his gun, and chased him off;  and (4) turned on the run and shot and twice hit an assailant who allegedly was shooting at him from behind.  The implausibility of this testimony alone is sufficient to ground the court's contrary finding.  Cf. United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 999 (1st Cir.1990) (implausibility of a defendant's testimony can be affirmative evidence of guilt), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 936, 111 S.Ct. 2062, 114 L.Ed.2d 466 (1991).  Furthermore, there was hearsay evidence in the Pre-Sentence Report indicating that a confidential informant had seen Powell with the .44 prior to the shooting.  Though not introduced at trial, this evidence was available to the district court at sentencing.  See United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.1992) (court may rely on hearsay evidence at sentencing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have, then, is an armed Powell not only remaining at a location where he knows a shoot-out is possible, but also seeking out the two young men (Cheney and Rhodes) who were involved in the initial confrontation--a confrontation that prompted Powell to insist that Boykins and her mother leave the area immediately.  In view of this factual scenario, we cannot say that the court clearly erred in finding that \"defendant chose to place himself in the middle of a shootout in which he chose not to withdraw, but to engage.\"   For the reasons stated above, this ends our inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject Powell's challenge to the district court's finding that the .44 was possessed in connection with another felony offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>D. Three-Level Increase for Possession of the Guns Found in the Fairlawn Estates Apartment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found at sentencing that Powell possessed the guns found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment.  It therefore increased Powell's offense level by one for possession of the guns, see Sec. 2K2.1(b)(1), and by two because one of the guns had an obliterated serial number, see Sec. 2K2.1(b)(4).  Powell challenges this finding on two grounds.  First, he contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding.  Second, he asserts that his possession of these guns was not \"part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,\" as is required by Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  We are not persuaded by Powell's arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we already have explained, the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the jury could find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the guns in the Fairlawn Estates apartment were possessed by Powell.  See supra Section II-A.  While fine semantic distinctions may make it theoretically possible for a court to have acted within the bounds of its discretion in deciding that a jury could make a preponderant finding, and then to have committed clear error in making the same preponderant finding itself, we are confident that this is not such a case.  We therefore rely on our earlier explanation in rejecting Powell's sufficiency argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Powell's \"same course of conduct\" argument has some superficial appeal--after all, the guns in the Fairlawn Estates apartment did not play any role in the Powell's possession of the .44 on Humboldt Avenue--it is foreclosed by circuit precedent.  In United States v. Sanders, 982 F.2d 4 (1st Cir.1992), we analyzed whether a defendant who had pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and to using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime could be subjected to an upward departure for possessing a weapon (used to shoot his girlfriend in the head) which was not named in the indictment.  See 982 F.2d at 9-10.   Answering this question required us to consider the scope of the \"same course of conduct provision\" in Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2), because the possession of the gun used in the shooting could only be taken into account at sentencing if it constituted relevant conduct under Sec. 1B1.3.  Id. at 9.   In answering the question in the affirmative, we said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"same course of conduct\" concept looks to whether the defendant repeats the same type of criminal activity over time.  It does not require that acts be connected together by common participants or by an overall scheme.  Here, defendant did repeat the same type of criminal activity--he illegally possessed three or four separate firearms when the victim was shot.  We have no difficulty viewing the illegal possession of the four weapons as all part of the same course of conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 9-10 (citation, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted).  In other words, the contemporaneous, or nearly contemporaneous, possession of uncharged firearms is, in this circuit, relevant conduct in the context of a felon-in-possession prosecution.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Powell clearly possessed the guns in the Fairlawn Estates apartment at the same time that he possessed the .44 used in the shooting.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that the possession of these weapons was part of the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject Powell's challenge to the court's three-level increase for the guns found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>E. Two-Level Increase for Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found at sentencing that Powell gave perjurious testimony as to how he came into possession of the .44.  The court therefore increased Powell's offense level by two for obstruction of justice.  See Sec. 3C1.1.  Powell challenges this finding on two grounds.  First, he contends that it was not accompanied by necessary subsidiary findings that the false testimony was \"concerning a material matter\" and given \"with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\"   See United States v. Dunnigan, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).  Second, he asserts that it was not supported by the evidence.  We need not and do not reach the merits of Powell's arguments (though we observe that we already have found there to be sufficient evidence to support the district court's implicit finding that Powell possessed the .44 prior to the shoot-out.  See supra Section II-C.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have affirmed each of the other upward adjustments imposed by the sentencing court (see supra Sections II-C and II-D), Powell's 120-month sentence would remain unchanged even if we were to find error in the court's two-level obstruction enhancement.  Reducing Powell's base offense level by two would still give him a guideline range of 120-150 months.  Thus, the sentencing court would be without the power to give him a lower sentence than the 120-month term of imprisonment he actually received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore decline to address Powell's challenge to the district court's finding that he obstructed justice by giving perjurious testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>F. Refusal to Depart Downward</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined Powell's request for a downward departure because he allegedly committed the offense of conviction \"in order to avoid a perceived greater harm\"--injury to himself or others.  See Sec. 5K2.11.  The court explained its decision as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And with respect to objection number 31, I understand that to be the argument made by the defendant here for downward departure in this case.  I must indicate that the defendant's actions here were not those of a good samaritan seeking to protect the community and the lives of other persons and it strikes me as not a grounds [sic] for downward departure in this setting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While acknowledging that we have no jurisdiction to review discretionary refusals to depart downward, see, e.g., United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1345 (1st Cir.1994) (court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to review district court's refusal to depart downward so long as court was aware of its authority to do so), Powell seizes on the court's use of the term \"good samaritan\" and asserts that the court failed to understand that it could depart if it found that Powell's possession of the firearm was prompted by the need for self -preservation.  Powell's argument is unconvincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already explained, the district court clearly believed that Powell possessed the .44 prior to the inception of the shoot-out.  See supra Section II-C.  This necessarily means that Powell possessed the .44 prior to the time when any need for self-defense would have arisen.  Accordingly, the court could not have found that Powell's illegal possession was prompted by the need to protect himself.  This leads us to conclude beyond any doubt whatsoever that the court did not misunderstand its departure authority under Sec. 5K2.11;  it merely decided that the facts did not warrant a departure in this instance, and used the term \"good samaritan\" a bit loosely in explaining its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore lack jurisdiction over Powell's challenge to the court's decision not to depart downward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the conviction and sentence of defendant Charles Powell.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 922(g)(1).  He was then sentenced to the statutory maximum of 120 months' imprisonment.  Powell challenges his conviction and sentence on a variety of grounds.  After carefully reading the record and considering Powell's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>A. General Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At shortly after 2:00 p.m. on October 7, 1992, Powell was standing outside of his truck.  He was holding food and conversing with Arvetta Boykins--his girlfriend--and Boykins' mother as the two women sat in the truck.  The truck was parked on Boston's Humboldt Avenue near its intersection with Ruthven Street and across from Humboldt Liquors.  As this conversation was taking place, a grayish-silver Subaru drove slowly down Ruthven and turned onto Humboldt.  There were four young men in the Subaru, each of whom was wearing a hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Subaru proceeded down Humboldt, the men in the car yelled something to a couple of young men--Chris Cheney and Ernest Rhodes--who were standing out on Humboldt.  Either Rhodes or Cheney yelled back.  After this exchange, the driver of the Subaru put the car in reverse and accelerated quickly, making a loud screeching sound.  Observing this, Powell handed his food to his girlfriend's mother and told the two women to \"get out of here.\"   Knowing that trouble was brewing, they quickly complied by driving off.  Powell then ran up Ruthven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By about 2:30 p.m., Powell had returned to Humboldt Avenue and was talking with Cheney and Rhodes in front of Humboldt Liquors.  Around this same time, Stanley Owens came around the corner of Ruthven and Humboldt on a mountain bike.  He had his hand in his jacket pocket and was leaning to his left.  At least one other youth also came on the scene simultaneously.  At some point, gunfire erupted.  The gunfire, which came from at least three guns, was continuous and lasted six or more seconds.  Three persons, including Powell, were wounded in the shoot-out;  Owens was killed.  Cheney and Rhodes escaped injury by taking cover inside of Humboldt Liquors.  Within an hour of the shooting, Powell was arrested.  At the time of his arrest, Powell was standing in an alley not far from the intersection of Ruthven and Humboldt, and was holding a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog handgun.  He also had a walking cane with him.  It was subsequently determined that a bullet from the .44 had killed Owens.  Powell does not dispute that he fired two shots with the .44 during the shoot-out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Necessity Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government argued that Powell shot Owens with a gun he had brought to the crime scene.  Powell consistently denied this, asserting as an affirmative defense that he took possession of the .44 only out of necessity in the midst of the shoot-out.  When he was in an ambulance after the shooting, Powell told an arresting officer that the youths in the gray Subaru had started shooting from the car, that a light-skinned black male had alighted and continued the shooting, that he (Powell) ran towards this shooter, and that the shooter then lost control of the weapon, dropped it to the ground, and jumped back into the Subaru, which sped off.  Powell stated that he picked up the gun and ran to the alley in which he was arrested.  He did not mention firing the weapon at anyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To clarify how the shooter lost control of the weapon, the officer asked Powell to repeat his story.  At this point, Powell told the officer that the light-skinned male got out of the Subaru, began the shooting, and fled on foot.  He did not mention the shooter dropping or losing control of his weapon.  When the officer asked how the weapon ended upon the ground, Powell did not answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Powell had a third account of what had happened.  Powell testified that he heard shots ring out as he stood in front of Humboldt Liquors talking with Cheney and Rhodes.  While Cheney and Rhodes sought refuge inside the store, Powell began running up the street towards the intersection of Humboldt and Ruthven.  Just then, a man who was pulling a gun out of his pocket came running around the corner.  The man pointed the gun at him, but was unable to fire it before Powell was upon him.  The two scuffled, and the gun fell to the ground.  The man fled around the corner and Powell picked up the gun.  Powell began to run across Ruthven and was shot in the leg.  He turned around and fired two shots at his assailant.  He then ran up Humboldt to Homestead Street, turned left on Homestead, and headed into an alley, where he found a walking cane.  He stayed in the alley until he was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Guns</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the shooting, an arresting officer retrieved a set of keys from Powell.  The keys were to a two-bedroom apartment at Fairlawn Estates in the Mattapan section of Boston.  The police obtained a search warrant for the apartment, and executed the warrant the same night as the shooting.  The search turned up two additional weapons:  a fully-loaded black Taurus 9 mm. semi-automatic pistol with an obliterated serial number;  and a .38 caliber derringer loaded with two rounds of ammunition.  The Taurus was hidden in a laundry basket located in the apartment's master bedroom.  The derringer was hidden on a closet shelf in the second bedroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Powell claimed to be nothing more than a sporadic visitor to the Fairlawn Estates apartment, the evidence, taken in a light most favorable to the government, established that Powell and Boykins (Powell's girlfriend) were living there at the time of the shooting.  Powell and Boykins had signed a rental application, lease, lease addendum, and rules and regulations acknowledgment for the apartment in August, 1992.  Moreover, Boykins told the grand jury that she and Powell (along with their two children) were living in the apartment, and that she and Powell shared the master bedroom.  This testimony was introduced at trial.  Finally, the evidence showed that Powell's name was on the mailbox for the apartment;  that only Powell and Boykins had keys to the apartment;  that Powell had personally visited the Fairlawn Estates apartment manager's office on at least two occasions in the months prior to the shooting;  and that Powell had once telephoned the apartment manager and made an oral request that repairs be made to the apartment.  Boykins testified that Powell's cousin and her children also were staying at the apartment around the time of the shooting.  Powell testified that his cousin's husband was staying there as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 1992, the grand jury returned a three-count indictment against Powell.  Count I charged him with being a felon unlawfully in possession of the .44 used in the shooting.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1).  Count II charged him with being a felon unlawfully in possession of the Taurus pistol, the derringer, and the ammunition found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment.  See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>   Count III </span>charged him with unlawfully possessing a firearm--the Taurus--with an obliterated serial number.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(k).  Prior to trial, the district court severed Counts II and III from the trial of Count I.  The court also granted Powell's motion in limine requesting that the government not be allowed to refer to the firearms and ammunition which were the subjects of Counts II and III during its opening statement or case-in-chief.  The court did, however, reserve judgment as to whether evidence relating to Counts II and III might become admissible after the defense put on its case.  The government complied with the court's order and did not allude to this evidence at any point during its case-in-chief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense called Arvetta Boykins as a witness.  She testified, in response to a question by defense counsel, that numerous random police searches of Powell in the months preceding the shoot-out had failed to turn up a weapon on his person or in his car.  The government then asked the court to revisit its ruling in limine.   At this point, the court allowed the government to cross-examine Boykins about whether she or Powell had stored in the Fairlawn Estates apartment the firearms described in Counts II and III of the indictment.  The court ruled that defense counsel had \"opened the door\" to this inquiry by asking Boykins whether \"she's seen him with a weapon on occasion.\"   Defense counsel, who had asked only about police searches of Powell in the months preceding the shoot-out, denied having asked such a question.  Boykins denied that the firearms were hers or Powell's.  After Boykins completed her testimony, Powell himself took the stand and asserted, inter alia, that he had never had a firearm on him in the summer of 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the court permitted the government to introduce the evidence underlying Counts II and III as part of its rebuttal case.  The court informed the jury that it should not consider the firearms found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment at all unless it first found that Powell possessed them.  The court also told the jury that, if it found that Powell did possess these firearms, it should not consider this evidence \"to show that the defendant was the kind of person who possessed firearms, but rather to show that the defendant had an opportunity to obtain firearms, that the defendant had knowledge of the availability of firearms, that [his possession of the .44] was not a question of mere necessity.\"   See Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).  The jury convicted Powell of the crime alleged in Count I of the indictment.  The government thereafter dismissed the severed Counts, II and III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 29, 1994, the district court sentenced Powell.  The court first assigned him a base offense level of 20 pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(a)(4) (1993).  The court then added the following nine offense-level increases:  four levels because the possession of the .44 took place in connection with another felony offense, i.e., the unjustifiable killing of Stanley Owens, see Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5);  one level because Powell's offense and relevant conduct involved the possession of three firearms, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at Sec. </span>2K2.1(b)(1);  two levels because one of the firearms had an obliterated serial number, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at Sec. </span>2K2.1(b)(4);  and two levels because Powell obstructed justice by giving \"perjurious\" testimony, see Sec. 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 3(b)).  These increases led to a final offense level of 29.  Because Powell had a criminal history category of V, his guideline sentencing range was 140 to 175 months.  In view of the ten-year statutory maximum applicable to the offense of conviction, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(a)(2), the court sentenced Powell to a 120-month term of imprisonment.  In so doing, the court rejected Powell's request for a downward departure from the applicable sentencing range because Powell purported to have committed the offense of conviction \"in order to avoid a perceived greater harm.\"   See Sec. 5K2.11 (allowing downward departures in some such situations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Powell makes six arguments on appeal:  (1) the district court committed reversible error in admitting evidence of the guns and ammunition found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment;  (2) the court committed reversible error in permitting the government to impeach Powell with his prior felony convictions;  (3) the court erred in increasing Powell's offense level by four on the grounds that Powell possessed the .44 in connection with another felony offense;  (4) the court erred in increasing Powell's offense level by three for \"relevant conduct\" that included the possession of the guns found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment;  (5) the court erred in increasing Powell's offense level by two for obstruction of justice;  and (6) the court erred in declining to depart downward.  We address each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>A.

First, Powell contends that the evidence is not relevant because the jury could not reasonably have concluded that he possessed the guns and ammunition discovered during the search.  Second, Powell asserts that the court erred in admitting the evidence under Rule 404(b), even if the jury could have found that he possessed the guns and ammunition.  Third, Powell insists that the court erred in deciding that the probative value of this evidence was not \"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury,\" see Fed.R.Evid. 403, even if the evidence was otherwise admissible.  In light of the deference we give to the challenged district court rulings, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the court conditioned the jury's consideration of the evidence found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment upon its initially finding possession of this evidence by Powell, the first part of Powell's argument implicates Fed.R.Evid. 104(b).  Rule 104(b) provides:  \"When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.\"   Like other admissibility rulings, the decision whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition is committed to the trial judge's \"wide discretion.\"   See Veranda Beach Club Ltd.

There was evidence that Powell was sharing the master bedroom of the Fairlawn Estates apartment at the time of the shooting;  that he had signed a variety of forms relating to the apartment;  that he had made a request for repairs to the apartment;  that his name was on the mailbox;  that he was one of only two persons with keys;  and that the guns found there did not belong to the apartment's other primary adult resident--Boykins.  This evidence was more than adequate for the court to have allowed the jury to consider whether Powell constructively possessed the Taurus and derringer that were hidden within the apartment.  All the evidence tended to show Powell's dominion over the apartment in which the guns were found, and some of it--Boykins' testimony that the guns were not hers--tended to show that the guns were Powell's (although we acknowledge Boykins' further testimony that the guns were not Powell's).  We therefore reject Powell's relevancy argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third parts of Powell's argument against the admissibility of the evidence from the Fairlawn Estates apartment do not fare any better.  In admitting this evidence, the district court employed the correct legal analysis.  The court first determined that the evidence had \"special relevance\" to material issues raised by Powell's case--whether Powell possessed firearms in the months preceding the shoot-out, whether Powell had an opportunity to obtain firearms, whether Powell had knowledge of the availability of firearms, and whether Powell's possession of the .44 was a question of mere necessity--and that it was not being offered to show Powell's character or propensity for criminal conduct.

Although the court may have oversimplified a bit in asserting that defense counsel had asked Boykins whether she'd seen Powell with a weapon on occasion, we think the court permissibly admitted the challenged evidence to rebut the implication plainly inhering in Boykins's testimony regarding the futile police searches of Powell in the months preceding the shoot-out:  that Powell was not a possessor of firearms at the time of the shooting.  We think that the challenged evidence bore special relevance to whether Powell only came into the possession of the .44 as a matter of necessity, or whether he was armed at the time the shooting began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have just stated, Powell attempted to bolster his necessity defense by introducing evidence--his and Boykins' testimony--suggesting that he was not a possessor of firearms at the time of the shoot-out.  In other words, Powell introduced evidence that he did not commit other similar acts at the relevant point in time.  While other-acts evidence is not generally admissible \"to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,\" see Rule 404(b), it is admissible to rebut a defendant 's affirmative claim that s/he did not commit other similar acts at the relevant point in time.  See, e.g., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597130\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Wood,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/597130/united-states-v-george-f-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">4</span> </a></span>(\"rebuttal evidence may be introduced to explain, repel, contradict or disprove an adversary's proof\") (citation omitted);  see also United States v.

The court therefore did not err in allowing the jury to consider whether Powell's contemporaneous constructive possession of the weapons in the Fairlawn Estates apartment tended to show that his possession of the .44 \"was not a question of mere necessity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court's careful and well-crafted limiting instruction--which told the jury that the evidence was not admissible to show that Powell was the kind of person who possessed firearms--largely dissipates any concern we might have had about the danger of unfair prejudice to Powell.  Simply put, we see no reason why the jury could not have followed the court's instruction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject Powell's argument that the admission of the evidence from the Fairlawn Estates apartment ran afoul of Rules 404(b) and 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>B.

Indeed, allowing the government only to inquire into the number, and not the nature, of Powell's prior felony convictions strikes us as an eminently fair way to balance the government's interest in impeaching Powell with Powell's interest in avoiding the \"unique risk of prejudice\" present whenever a testifying defendant is impeached with evidence of his/her prior convictions:  \"the danger that convictions that would be excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 404 will be misused by a jury as propensity evidence despite their introduction solely for impeachment purposes.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 609 advisory committee's note, 1990 amendment;  see also <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195627\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Tracy,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/195627/united-states-v-tracy/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject Powell's claim of reversible error in the introduction of this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>C. Four-Level Increase for Possession in Connection with Another Felony Offense</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found at sentencing that Powell's possession of the .44 was committed in connection with another felony offense--the unjustified killing of Stanley Owens.  The court explained its finding as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find, first, that the defendant was engaged in activity which involved him in an unjustified homicide.  I do not credit the defendant's testimony--indeed, I find it to have been perjurious--as to the manner in which he found himself in possession of the firearm here.  Accordingly, I find that the defendant was in possession of the firearm in connection with another felony offense, an unjustifiable homicide under state law.  I will not get into the particulars of how that may have been charged under state law, what degree of murder or manslaughter, simply that there was no defense of self-defense.  There was no defense of necessity.  There was no defense for the defense of other persons, but rather that the defendant chose to place himself in the middle of a shootout in which he chose not to withdraw, but to engage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court therefore increased Powell's offense level by four.  See Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5).  Powell takes issue with the court's finding, arguing that there was no evidence to support it.  We do not agree with Powell's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard by which we review a district court's application of a sentencing guideline depends upon the nature of the challenge before us.  If a party claims error in the court's interpretation of a guideline's meaning or scope, our review is plenary.  E.g., United States v. Thompson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195550\"><a href=\"/opinion/195550/united-states-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1994).  If a party assigns error to a factual finding made at sentencing, we review the finding for clear error.  See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195550\"><a href=\"/opinion/195550/united-states-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 4-5. </a></span>  In so doing, we ask only whether the court clearly erred in finding that the government proved the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.  See United States v. Mocciola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533000\"><a href=\"/opinion/533000/united-states-v-gerard-peter-mocciola/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to note that Powell does not challenge the trial court's apparent legal conclusion that the killing of Stanley Owens was necessarily unjustified if, as the court found, Powell placed himself into the middle of the shoot-out instead of withdrawing.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Kendrick, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2056964\"><a href=\"/opinion/2056964/commonwealth-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2056964\"><a href=\"/opinion/2056964/commonwealth-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 414 (1966) (\"The right of self-defence does not accrue to a person until he has availed all proper means to avoid physical combat.\").  In his brief, Powell questions only the factual finding itself (along with the statement that \"there was no defense of self-defense,\" which he treats as a separate finding), asserting that there was no evidentiary basis to support the court's upward adjustment.  We therefore will not review the trial court's legal conclusion, and will look only to whether the outcome-determinative finding--that Powell chose to place himself in the middle of the shoot-out instead of withdrawing--was clearly erroneous.  We think that it was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central to our decision is the court's tacit determination that Powell knew of the possibility of a shoot-out prior to its taking place.  Especially given the applicable preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, this determination is sustainable.  Immediately after seeing the hooded men in the Subaru and hearing the car rapidly accelerate in reverse, Powell insisted that Boykins and her mother get out of the area as quickly as possible.  This gives rise to an inference that Powell knew serious trouble might ensue.  Moreover, Powell conceded on cross-examination that he thought the men in the Subaru were gang members, and that he knew there had been at least one shooting in the area in the previous week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also important to our conclusion is the court's finding that Powell possessed the .44 prior to the inception of the shoot-out (a finding which is implicit in the court's stated disbelief of Powell's testimony \"as to the manner in which he found himself in possession of the firearm here\").  This finding, too, is sustainable.  Powell's trial testimony as to how he came to possess the .44 not only contradicted the accounts he gave to an arresting officer shortly after the shoot-out, but it also was inherently improbable.  Powell testified that, instead of taking cover inside Humboldt Liquors with Cheney and Rhodes when shots unexpectedly began to ring out (as one might have expected him to do), he began running and (1) continued to run up the street towards a man who had come around the corner and was pointing a gun at him;  (2) closed the distance between the man and himself before the man could fire a shot;  (3) disarmed the man, seized his gun, and chased him off;  and (4) turned on the run and shot and twice hit an assailant who allegedly was shooting at him from behind.  The implausibility of this testimony alone is sufficient to ground the court's contrary finding.  Cf. United States v. Hadfield, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551471\"><a href=\"/opinion/551471/united-states-v-royal-w-hadfield-jr-united-states-of-america-v-helen/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 999 (1st Cir.1990) (implausibility of a defendant's testimony can be affirmative evidence of guilt), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2062</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span> </span>(1991).  Furthermore, there was hearsay evidence in the Pre-Sentence Report indicating that a confidential informant had seen Powell with the .44 prior to the shooting.  Though not introduced at trial, this evidence was available to the district court at sentencing.  See United States v. Tardiff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587242\"><a href=\"/opinion/587242/united-states-v-claude-paul-tardiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1287 (1st Cir.1992) (court may rely on hearsay evidence at sentencing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have, then, is an armed Powell not only remaining at a location where he knows a shoot-out is possible, but also seeking out the two young men (Cheney and Rhodes) who were involved in the initial confrontation--a confrontation that prompted Powell to insist that Boykins and her mother leave the area immediately.  In view of this factual scenario, we cannot say that the court clearly erred in finding that \"defendant chose to place himself in the middle of a shootout in which he chose not to withdraw, but to engage.\"   For the reasons stated above, this ends our inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject Powell's challenge to the district court's finding that the .44 was possessed in connection with another felony offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>D. Three-Level Increase for Possession of the Guns Found in the Fairlawn Estates Apartment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found at sentencing that Powell possessed the guns found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment.  It therefore increased Powell's offense level by one for possession of the guns, see Sec. 2K2.1(b)(1), and by two because one of the guns had an obliterated serial number, see Sec. 2K2.1(b)(4).  Powell challenges this finding on two grounds.  First, he contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding.  Second, he asserts that his possession of these guns was not \"part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,\" as is required by Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  We are not persuaded by Powell's arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we already have explained, the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the jury could find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the guns in the Fairlawn Estates apartment were possessed by Powell.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> supra </span>Section II-A.  While fine semantic distinctions may make it theoretically possible for a court to have acted within the bounds of its discretion in deciding that a jury could make a preponderant finding, and then to have committed clear error in making the same preponderant finding itself, we are confident that this is not such a case.  We therefore rely on our earlier explanation in rejecting Powell's sufficiency argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Powell's \"same course of conduct\" argument has some superficial appeal--after all, the guns in the Fairlawn Estates apartment did not play any role in the Powell's possession of the .44 on Humboldt Avenue--it is foreclosed by circuit precedent.  In United States v. Sanders, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597131\"><a href=\"/opinion/597131/united-states-v-steven-h-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span> </a></span>(1st Cir.1992), we analyzed whether a defendant who had pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and to using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime could be subjected to an upward departure for possessing a weapon (used to shoot his girlfriend in the head) which was not named in the indictment.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> <span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">9-10</span></span>.   Answering this question required us to consider the scope of the \"same course of conduct provision\" in Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2), because the possession of the gun used in the shooting could only be taken into account at sentencing if it constituted relevant conduct under Sec. 1B1.3.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 9. </span>  In answering the question in the affirmative, we said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"same course of conduct\" concept looks to whether the defendant repeats the same type of criminal activity over time.  It does not require that acts be connected together by common participants or by an overall scheme.  Here, defendant did repeat the same type of criminal activity--he illegally possessed three or four separate firearms when the victim was shot.  We have no difficulty viewing the illegal possession of the four weapons as all part of the same course of conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 9-10 </span>(citation, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted).  In other words, the contemporaneous, or nearly contemporaneous, possession of uncharged firearms is, in this circuit, relevant conduct in the context of a felon-in-possession prosecution.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Powell clearly possessed the guns in the Fairlawn Estates apartment at the same time that he possessed the .44 used in the shooting.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that the possession of these weapons was part of the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject Powell's challenge to the court's three-level increase for the guns found in the Fairlawn Estates apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>E. Two-Level Increase for Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found at sentencing that Powell gave perjurious testimony as to how he came into possession of the .44.  The court therefore increased Powell's offense level by two for obstruction of justice.  See Sec. 3C1.1.  Powell challenges this finding on two grounds.  First, he contends that it was not accompanied by necessary subsidiary findings that the false testimony was \"concerning a material matter\" and given \"with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\"   See United States v. Dunnigan, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span> </a></span>(1993).  Second, he asserts that it was not supported by the evidence.  We need not and do not reach the merits of Powell's arguments (though we observe that we already have found there to be sufficient evidence to support the district court's implicit finding that Powell possessed the .44 prior to the shoot-out.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> supra </span>Section II-C.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have affirmed each of the other upward adjustments imposed by the sentencing court <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">(see</span> supra </span>Sections II-C and II-D), Powell's 120-month sentence would remain unchanged even if we were to find error in the court's two-level obstruction enhancement.  Reducing Powell's base offense level by two would still give him a guideline range of 120-150 months.  Thus, the sentencing court would be without the power to give him a lower sentence than the 120-month term of imprisonment he actually received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore decline to address Powell's challenge to the district court's finding that he obstructed justice by giving perjurious testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>F. Refusal to Depart Downward</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined Powell's request for a downward departure because he allegedly committed the offense of conviction \"in order to avoid a perceived greater harm\"--injury to himself or others.  See Sec. 5K2.11.  The court explained its decision as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And with respect to objection number 31, I understand that to be the argument made by the defendant here for downward departure in this case.  I must indicate that the defendant's actions here were not those of a good samaritan seeking to protect the community and the lives of other persons and it strikes me as not a grounds [sic] for downward departure in this setting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While acknowledging that we have no jurisdiction to review discretionary refusals to depart downward, see, e.g., United States v. Lewis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195723\"><a href=\"/opinion/195723/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span>, 1345 (1st Cir.1994) (court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to review district court's refusal to depart downward so long as court was aware of its authority to do so), Powell seizes on the court's use of the term \"good samaritan\" and asserts that the court failed to understand that it could depart if it found that Powell's possession of the firearm was prompted by the need for self -preservation.  Powell's argument is unconvincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already explained, the district court clearly believed that Powell possessed the .44 prior to the inception of the shoot-out.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">See</span> supra </span>Section II-C.  This necessarily means that Powell possessed the .44 prior to the time when any need for self-defense would have arisen.  Accordingly, the court could not have found that Powell's illegal possession was prompted by the need to protect himself.  This leads us to conclude beyond any doubt whatsoever that the court did not misunderstand its departure authority under Sec. 5K2.11;  it merely decided that the facts did not warrant a departure in this instance, and used the term \"good samaritan\" a bit loosely in explaining its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore lack jurisdiction over Powell's challenge to the court's decision not to depart downward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the conviction and sentence of defendant Charles Powell.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
