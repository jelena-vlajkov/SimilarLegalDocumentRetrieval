King on brief pro se.\n                  \n   Donald  K.  Stern, United  States  Attorney,  and Sheila  W.\n                                                               \nSawyer, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n    \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.   Appellant, Phillip King, appeals  pro\n                    \n\nse from a judgment  of the district court denying  his motion\n\nunder 28 U.S.C.    2255 to vacate, set aside,  or correct his\n\nsentence. In his  opening brief, he  alleges two grounds  for\n\nrelief:   (1) the government  breached the plea  agreement in\n\ntaking  the position  that  the  appropriate offense  section\n\nunder  the  Sentencing Guidelines  is  U.S.S.G.    2A2.2  for\n\n\"aggravated assault\"; and (2) the  district court erred as  a\n\nmatter of law by using   2A2.2 to  calculate his base offense\n\nlevel.  The  government argues,  inter alia,  that we  should\n                                           \n\ndismiss the  instant appeal  because  appellant's failure  to\n\npursue a direct appeal  constitutes a procedural default, and\n\nappellant has made no showing of \"cause and prejudice\"  under\n\nUnited States v. Frady, 456  U.S. 152 (1982) (applying \"cause\n                      \n\nand  prejudice\"  test  to   procedural  defaults  in     2255\n\ncontext).    Appellant replies  that  he did  not  appeal his\n\nsentence  because the  district  court (and  defense counsel)\n\nfailed to advise him of his right to do so, thereby depriving\n\nhim of his right  to a direct appeal.   See Fed. R.  Crim. P.\n                                           \n\n32(a)(2) (imposing a  duty on the sentencing court  to advise\n\nthe defendant of any right to appeal the sentence following a\n\nguilty plea).  \n\n          We  bypass  the  issue  of waiver  because  we  are\n\npersuaded, for the reasons articulated by the district court,\n\nthat  appellant's claims  in  his opening  brief are  without\n\n                             -2-\n\nmerit.   See, e.g., Murchu v.  United States, 926 F.2d 50, 53\n                                            \n\nn.4 (1st Cir.) (per curiam) (declining to address question of\n\nprocedural   default  where   appellant's      2255   filings\n\nestablished that his claim  was meritless), cert. denied, 112\n                                                        \n\nS. Ct. 99  (1991).  We do not address appellant's argument in\n\nhis reply brief that  he was deprived of the right  to direct\n\nappeal because this argument  was neither presented below nor\n\nraised on appeal in  a timely fashion.  See,  e.g., Sandstrom\n                                                             \n\nv. Chemlawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir. 1990) (arguments\n                 \n\nnot  made to the district  court or in  the opening brief are\n\nwaived).   However, our  affirmance of the  judgment below is\n\nwithout prejudice to appellant's  right to file a new    2255\n\nmotion on this latter ground.  \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -3-\n",
