This  controversy features  an\r                    SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nold-fashioned  tug of  war.   Pulling  in  one direction  is  the\r\n\nInternal Revenue Service  (IRS) which, for easily  understandable\r\n\nreasons,  is intent on learning  the identity of  persons who pay\r\n\nlarge legal fees in cash.  Pulling in the opposite direction is a\r\n\nconsortium consisting  of two lawyers and  three bar associations\r\n\n(appearing  as amici  curiae) which,  for  equally understandable\r\n\nreasons   (fearing   inter   alia  that   disclosure   may   spur\r                                           \r\n\nprosecution), is  intent on safeguarding the  identity of clients\r\n\nwho pay in cash.  In  this case, the parties' positions  hardened\r\n\nand a stalemate  developed.  The district  court resolved matters\r\n\nin the lawyers' favor, refusing to enforce IRS summonses designed\r\n\nto obtain \"client identity\" information pursuant to section 6050I\r\n\nof the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.), 26 U.S.C.    6050I (1988 &amp;\r\n\nSupp. V  1993).  See United  States v. Gertner, 873  F. Supp. 729\r                                                        \r\n\n(D. Mass. 1995).   The government appeals.  We  affirm (albeit on\r\n\nmore  circumscribed grounds  than those  enumerated by  the lower\r\n\ncourt).\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Federal  law,  specifically  I.R.C.     6050I  and  its\r\n\nimplementing  regulations, requires  a person  who  receives more\r\n\nthan   $10,000  in  cash  during   a  single  trade  or  business\r\n\ntransaction  to file a form  (IRS Form 8300)  reporting the name,\r\n\naddress,  occupation, and  social security  number of  the payor,\r\n\nalong with the date and nature of the  transaction and the amount\r\n\ninvolved.  See I.R.C.    6050I; 26 C.F.R.    1.6050I-1(e) (1995).\r                        \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nAt  various times in 1991 and 1992, respondents Nancy Gertner and\r\n\nJody  Newman, then  partners in  a Boston  law firm,  filed forms\r\n\nreflecting four  successive payments of  hefty cash  fees to  the\r\n\nfirm by  a single  client.   Each  of the  forms was  essentially\r\n\ncomplete  except for  the name  of the  client.   The respondents\r\n\nadvised the  IRS that they were withholding the client's identity\r\n\non the basis of  ethical obligations, attorney-client  privilege,\r\n\nand specified constitutional protections.\r\n\n          These   filings    sparked   a   lengthy    course   of\r\n\ncorrespondence  between  the  law firm  and  the  IRS.   In  that\r\n\nexchange,  members  of  the  firm attempted  on  at  least  three\r\n\noccasions  to  determine  whether  the  IRS  wanted  the  omitted\r\n\ninformation as part of an investigation focused on the firm or to\r\n\nlearn more  about the unnamed client.   The IRS did  not deign to\r\n\nanswer these inquiries.\r\n\n          The  parties remained  deadlocked  and  the IRS  issued\r\n\nsummonses purporting to direct the respondents to furnish certain\r\n\nrecords  and   testimony  anent  the  client's   identity.    The\r\n\nrespondents declined  to comply.  The government  then brought an\r\n\nenforcement  action  pursuant to  I.R.C.      7402(a) &amp;  7604(a),\r\n\nclaiming that  it wanted the  information in  connection with  an\r\n\ninvestigation  of the  law firm's  tax liability.   On  April 20,\r\n\n1994, after perusing the complaint and the declaration of Revenue\r\n\nAgent Sophia  Ameno, the district court issued an order directing\r\n\nthe respondents to show cause why they should not be compelled to\r\n\nhonor the summonses.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          The   court   permitted   the   client   to   intervene\r\n\npseudonymously.   Thereafter, the respondents and  the intervenor\r\n\nmounted two lines of  defense.  First, they asseverated  that the\r\n\nIRS's  alleged investigation of the  lawyers was merely a pretext\r\n\ndisguising  its real objective   learning more about the client  \r\n\nand that  the government therefore  should be required  to follow\r\n\nthe   statutory   procedure  for   issuing   summonses  affecting\r\n\nunidentified third parties.1   See I.R.C.   7609(f).   Second, in\r                                            \r\n\nconcert with the amici they  insisted that various privileges and\r\n\nprotections allow lawyers to  shield their client's identity from\r\n\nthe reach of  such summonses.   The IRS  joined issue,  asserting\r\n\nthat  it  had  employed   the  appropriate  procedure;  that  the\r\n\nrespondents  had   failed  to  show  either   that  the  supposed\r\n\ninvestigation  of the law  firm was  a sham  or that  an improper\r\n\nmotive  tainted  the summonses;  and,  finally,  that no  special\r\n\nprotection of any kind attached to the desired information.\r\n\n          When the day of  decision dawned, the respondents asked\r\n\nthe  district  court to  take  live  testimony.   The  government\r\n\nopposed the request.  The court eschewed the evidentiary  hearing\r\n\nthat the  respondents sought but nevertheless  refused to enforce\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Such  a  summons is  known  colloquially  as  a \"John  Doe\"\r\nsummons.   The IRS cannot issue  a John Doe summons    defined by\r\nstatute as a  summons \"which  does not identify  the person  with\r\nrespect to whose liability the summons is issued\"   without first\r\nsecuring  court  approval.   I.R.C.    7609(f).   The  reason for\r\nrequiring such approval is obvious:  in the John Doe context, the\r\ncourt in effect \"takes  the place of the affected  taxpayer\" who,\r\nbeing unnamed, cannot  herself be  expected to know  about    let\r\nalone to oppose    the summons even if it  is irregular.  Tiffany\r                                                                           \r\nFine Arts, Inc. v. United  States, 469 U.S. 310, 321 (1985).   We\r                                           \r\ndiscuss the mechanics of the preapproval process infra.\r                                                                \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nthe summonses.  It found as a fact that the IRS's purported probe\r\n\nof the law firm's  tax-related affairs was a  hoax, and that  the\r\n\nIRS should have complied  with I.R.C.   7609(f) prior  to serving\r\n\nthe summonses.  See  Gertner, 873 F. Supp.  at 734.  Nor  did the\r                                      \r\n\ncourt  stop  there;  it  proceeded   to  hold  that,  under   the\r\n\ncircumstances  here  obtaining,  the   attorney-client  privilege\r\n\nthwarted  the IRS's  demand  for  information  concerning  client\r\n\nidentity.  See id. at 734-37.  This appeal ensued.\r                            \r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          We split  our analysis into three segments.   First, we\r\n\nlimn  the   framework   for  determining   whether  the   federal\r\n\njudiciary's imprimatur  should be impressed upon  an IRS summons.\r\n\nNext, we mull the  district court's finding on the  pretext issue\r\n\nunder  the deferential standard  of review that  pertains in this\r\n\ncontext.  Lastly, we explain why the IRS's failure to comply with\r\n\nI.R.C.   7609(f) effectively ended the case.\r\n\n                        A.  The Framework.\r                                  A.  The Framework.\r                                                   \r\n\n          The IRS  has broad  authority to issue  summonses under\r\n\nI.R.C.    7602 &amp;  7604.  Enforcement proceedings are  designed to\r\n\nbe summary, see  Donaldson v.  United States, 400  U.S. 517,  529\r                                                      \r\n\n(1971); United States v.  Freedom Church, 613 F.2d 316,  321 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1979), and the court's role is simply to ensure that the IRS\r\n\nis using its broad authority in good faith and in compliance with\r\n\nthe law.   See Donaldson, 400 U.S. at 536;  United States v. Kis,\r                                                                          \r\n\n658  F.2d 526, 535  (7th Cir. 1981), cert.  denied, 455 U.S. 1018\r                                                            \r\n\n(1982).  Thus, when a  challenge to a summons is lodged,  the IRS\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nmust only satisfy the  court that (1) its investigation  is being\r\n\nconducted  pursuant  to a  proper  purpose,  (2) the  information\r\n\nsought  in the summons  is (or may be)  relevant to that purpose,\r\n\n(3)  the information is not  already within the IRS's possession,\r\n\nand  (4)  all legally  required  administrative  steps have  been\r\n\nfollowed.   See  United  States v.  Powell,  379 U.S.  48,  57-58\r                                                    \r\n\n(1964);  Copp v.

See Freedom Church, 613  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n321; United States v.

To mount  the first tier,  the IRS must make  a\r\n\nprima  facie showing that  it is acting  in good faith  and for a\r\n\nlawful purpose.  This burden is  not taxing, so to speak.  Courts\r\n\nrepeatedly have confirmed that  an affidavit of the investigating\r\n\nagent attesting  to satisfaction of  the four Powell  elements is\r                                                              \r\n\nitself  adequate to make the requisite prima facie showing.

The term \"burden of\r\nproof\" may  refer to either a burden or production or a burden of\r\npersuasion.  See Kenneth S.

Only  the burden of production  is at issue\r\nwhen the taxpayer attempts to rebut the IRS's prima facie showing\r\nand thereby justify further inquiry.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nat 824; McCarthy, 514 F.2d at 376.  To reach this goal, it is not\r                          \r\n\nabsolutely  essential  that  the taxpayer  adduce  additional  or\r\n\nindependent  evidence; she may hoist her  burden either by citing\r\n\nnew  facts or  by  bringing to  light  mortal weaknesses  in  the\r\n\ngovernment's proffer. \r\n\n          If  the taxpayer  satisfies this burden  of production,\r\n\nthe third tier beckons.  At this stage, the district court weighs\r\n\nthe facts,  draws inferences, and decides  the issue.  To  do so,\r\n\nthe  court frequently  will  proceed to  an evidentiary  hearing,\r\n\ntaking testimony  and exhibits  from  both sides.   See  Samuels,\r                                                                           \r\n\nKramer, 712  F.2d at 1347-48; Salter, 432 F.2d at 700.

A\r\n\ndistrict court  may, in  appropriate circumstances, forgo  such a\r\n\nhearing and decide the issues on the existing  record.  See Copp,\r                                                                          \r\n\n968 F.2d at 1438 n.1; McCarthy, 514 F.2d at 373.\r                                        \r\n\n          A  question  lingers  at  the  third  tier  as  to  the\r\n\ncontinuing  viability of the original presumption in favor of the\r\n\nIRS.   The case law seems to suggest that the presumption endures\r\n\nand serves at  this stage to saddle the taxpayer  with the burden\r\n\nof persuading the judge, qua factfinder, that at least one of the\r                                      \r\n\nPowell  elements is  missing.   See, e.g.,  Kis, 658 F.2d  at 540\r                                                         \r\n\n(stating  that a  taxpayer  \"can succeed  only  by showing  by  a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence some improper use of the summons by\r\n\nthe  IRS\"); Freedom  Church,  613 F.2d  at  319 (\"The  burden  of\r                                     \r\n\nproving an abuse of the court's process or the absence  of one of\r\n\nthe Powell elements of good faith is on the summonee.\"); see also\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nUnited States v.

We  are somewhat skeptical  of this approach,\r\n\nespecially   given   the  Supreme   Court's   recent   lesson  on\r\n\npresumptions and burdens of  proof in an analogous setting.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSt. Mary's  Honor Ctr.  v. Hicks,  113 S.

The  Court's  treatment of  presumptions in\r\n\nHicks is  consistent with  the basic  principle, codified  in the\r               \r\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence:\r\n\n          In  all  civil  actions  and  proceedings not\r\n          otherwise provided for by  Act of Congress or\r\n          by these rules, a presumption imposes on  the\r\n          party against whom it  is directed the burden\r\n          of  going forward  with evidence to  rebut or\r\n          meet the presumption,  but does not shift  to\r\n          such party  the burden of proof  in the sense\r\n          of the risk  of nonpersuasion, which  remains\r\n          throughout the  trial upon the party  on whom\r\n          it was originally cast.\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 301.\r\n\n          We  are hard-pressed  to  fathom  why  IRS  enforcement\r\n\nproceedings should diverge from  this principle.  It is  the IRS,\r\n\nnot  the  taxpayer, that  seeks to  invoke  the processes  of the\r\n\ncourt; and, in a  related vein, the court is  instructed to grant\r\n\nthe  requested  relief  only  when \"sufficient  proof  is  made.\"\r\n\nI.R.C.   7604(b).  Though it certainly can be argued that \"strong\r\n\nreasons of  public  policy\"  justify  a  burden-shifting  scheme,\r\n\nSalter, 432 F.2d at 700, it  would seem that the IRS's legitimate\r                \r\n\ninterest  in  obtaining  summary  enforcement  is  satisfactorily\r\n\naddressed by  the particularized burden of  production imposed on\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nthe  taxpayer, without going the  whole hog.4   See, e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

LaSalle Nat'l  Bank,\r                                                                          \r\n437  U.S. 298  (1978).   Foremost among  these statements  is the\r\nPowell  Court's comment that \"[t]he burden of showing an abuse of\r                \r\nthe court's process is on the taxpayer.\"  379 U.S. at 58.  We are\r\nnot confident that  this slender  reed can bear  the strain  that\r\nsubsequent opinions have placed on it.  Powell itself imposed the\r                                                        \r\nburden  on  the  IRS to  \"show  that  the  investigation will  be\r\nconducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose, that the  inquiry may\r\nbe  relevant to the purpose,  that the information  sought is not\r\nalready  within  the  Commissioner's  possession,  and  that  the\r\nadministrative steps  required by  the Code have  been followed.\"\r\nId. at 57-58.   The  Court's subsequent reference  to proving  an\r             \r\nabuse  of process,  read  in context,  seems  to be  confined  to\r\naffirmative  defenses, e.g.,  allegations  of  harassment in  the\r\nconduct of an investigation.  See id. at 58.\r                                               \r\n          By  like  token,  the  LaSalle Court's  statement  that\r                                                  \r\n\"those  opposing enforcement of a  summons do bear  the burden to\r\ndisprove  the actual existence of a valid civil tax determination\r\nor  collection purpose  by the  Service,\" 437  U.S. at  316, does\r\nlittle to prop up the government's burden-of-proof argument.  The\r\nLaSalle  Court  held  that,  even  if  the  IRS  had  a  criminal\r                 \r\nprosecution  in mind,  this fact  would not  constitute a  per se\r\nimproper purpose  for a civil summons, because civil and criminal\r\ntax  investigations  are  typically too  intertwined  to untangle\r\neasily.  See id. at 314-16.  Hence,  the quoted statement applies\r                          \r\nonly in situations where the taxpayer is seeking to avail herself\r\nof  the \"sole criminal purpose\" defense to a summons.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\nCopp, 968 F.2d at 1437.\r              \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nthe respondents concede that  the district court tacitly required\r\n\nthem  to  prove  improper  purpose  by  a  preponderance  of  the\r\n\nevidence,  and they  accepted  the burden  of  proof without  any\r\n\nobjection.   Consequently, we proceed  on the assumption that the\r\n\nlower  court's resolution of the  issue will prevail  only if the\r\n\nrecord suffices  for a finding  that the respondents  carried the\r\n\ndevoir of persuasion.\r\n\n               B.

While  the declaration  touches  the\r\n\nrequisite bases    it  contains the bareboned  allegations needed\r\n\nfor the government's prima  facie showing   it is  utterly devoid\r\n\nof specifics.  Though a conclusory affidavit is enough to satisfy\r\n\nthe  government's burden at the first tier of the framework, see,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Sylvestre, 978 F.2d at 26; Lawn  Builders, 856 F.2d at 392,\r                                                         \r\n\nit  can  come back  to haunt  the proponent  if  it is  not later\r\n\nsupplemented by  more hearty fare once the challenger succeeds in\r\n\nscaling the second tier.\r\n\n          At any rate, the government effectuated its prima facie\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nshowing with little room  to spare.   The burden then shifted  to\r\n\nthe  respondents  to  produce   evidence  and/or  allegations  of\r\n\nsufficient  force and exactitude to warrant  further inquiry.  To\r\n\nmeet  this  burden, the  respondents  argued  that the  summonses\r\n\nshould be  shelved because  the government's professed  purpose  \r\n\nlinking the summonses to an investigation into the law firm's tax\r\n\nliability   was pretextual.\r\n\n          Contrary to the government's dismissive suggestion, the\r\n\nrespondents did  not simply level the charge.   In support of it,\r\n\nthey submitted  two affidavits.   One affidavit  incorporated the\r\n\nextensive  correspondence between  the  firm and  the  IRS.   The\r\n\nsecond affidavit  chronicled the firm's  meticulous attention  to\r\n\nincome reporting requirements, and  asserted that the IRS already\r\n\nhad  the data it  needed to determine whether  the firm had fully\r\n\ncomplied  with its  tax-related  obligations.   In addition,  the\r\n\nrespondents documented  several public  statements which  seem to\r\n\nimply  that the IRS's  purpose in issuing  summonses to attorneys\r\n\nfor  the records of large cash-paying clients is designed less to\r\n\nmonitor  lawyers' compliance  with  the  tax  laws, and  more  to\r\n\naddress money  laundering,  narcotics distribution,  and  kindred\r\n\ncriminal  activity on the part  of lawyers' clients.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nIRS  Publication 1544 (rev.

On appeal,  the IRS  rides two\r                 \r\n\nhorses  into the breach.   First, it maintains  that the district\r\n\ncourt  erred  in  stabling   the  summonses  without  holding  an\r\n\nevidentiary  hearing.  Second, it posits that, in all events, the\r\n\ncourt's ultimate finding of pretext,  based on the record  before\r\n\nit, is unsupportable.  Both steeds are lame.\r\n\n          1.

Determining the IRS's purpose\r\n\nin  conducting an  investigation  is, like  most  motive-oriented\r\n\nexplorations, a predominantly  factbound enterprise.   It follows\r\n\nthat, absent  a  mistake of  law,  an appellate  tribunal  should\r\n\ndisturb the  district court's determination only if it is clearly\r\n\nerroneous.  See  United States v. Ritchie, 15 F.3d  592, 599 (6th\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.), cert.  denied, 115 S.

This means, of course, that\r\n\nif  there  are  two  or more  plausible  interpretations  of  the\r\n\nevidence, the district court's choice among them must  hold sway.\r\n\nSee Johnson v. Watts  Regulator Co.,     F.3d    ,      (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1995) [No. 95-1002, slip op. at 22].\r\n\n          Here, no  clear error looms.  The government's case for\r\n\nenforcing the summonses depended  entirely on Agent Ameno's self-\r\n\nserving declaration (which, as we have previously indicated, is a\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nweb   of  unsubstantiated   conclusions).     In  contrast,   the\r\n\nrespondents fashioned a sufficient evidentiary  infrastructure to\r\n\nsupport  an inference that the IRS's sole purpose in pursuing the\r\n\nsummonses  was to  gain  information about  the lawyers'  unnamed\r\n\nclient.   The law  firm's affidavit, if  credited, indicates that\r\n\nthe  IRS had no apparent reason  to suspect it of any tax-related\r\n\nimpropriety.    And,  moreover,  the  IRS's   use  of  a  generic\r\n\naffidavit,  devoid of  particularization, suggests  that the  IRS\r\n\nnever  really suspected  the firm  of any  questionable activity.\r\n\nThe IRS's stonewalling    its unexplained  refusal to answer  the\r\n\nfirm's  repeated inquiries  as to  whether it  was in  fact under\r\n\ninvestigation   points in the same direction.  These facts, taken\r\n\nin  light   of  the  IRS's  self-proclaimed   practice  of  using\r\n\ninformation  gleaned  from  attorneys'  Form 8300  filings  as  a\r\n\nvehicle for investigating clients  who pay counsel fees in  cash,\r\n\nmake the district court's conclusion that  the IRS's interest lay\r\n\nonly in  the  unidentified  client  seem  quite  plausible.    We\r              \r\n\nconclude, therefore,  that notwithstanding any  presumption which\r\n\nmay  have accompanied  the IRS's prima  facie showing,  the court\r\n\nbelow reasonably  could have  found that  a preponderance  of the\r\n\nevidence  favored  the  respondents'  claim  of  pretext.6    See\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6The  government   argues  that  this   finding  is   flatly\r\ninconsistent with the district court's original acceptance of the\r\nAmeno declaration as a sufficient basis for issuing a  show-cause\r\norder.  We do not agree.   The acceptance of the IRS's first-tier\r\nproffer signifies nothing more  than the court's  acknowledgement\r\nthat  the IRS has mustered a prima facie showing for enforcement.\r\nOnce the  respondents met their second-tier  burden of production\r\nand  raised  a legitimate  question  about  the  validity of  the\r\nsummonses, however, the court was free to reevaluate the original\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nRitchie,  15  F.3d  at  599  (\"Although  there  was  evidence  to\r                 \r\n\ncontradict  this view  and the  IRS strenuously  objects to  [the\r\n\ncourt's] finding,  [the] findings are not  clearly erroneous, and\r\n\nwe therefore adopt them.\").\r\n\n          The  government  argues  that  the  decision  in United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

There, the  Second Circuit upheld  a summons issued\r\n\nfor the dual purpose of  investigating both a designated taxpayer\r\n\nand  a John  Doe, see 718  F.2d at  13-14, and  the Supreme Court\r                               \r\n\naffirmed, see 469 U.S. at 324.   The government tries to shoehorn\r                       \r\n\nthis case into the Tiffany last.  The fit, however, is imperfect.\r                                    \r\n\n          In Tiffany, unlike here, the district court ascertained\r                              \r\n\nas a matter of fact  that the IRS had a dual purpose, that is, an\r\n\nactual interest in the investigation of both the taxpayer and the\r                                                                       \r\n\nJohn Doe.  See  469 at 317 (recounting district  court's findings\r                        \r\n\nof fact).  In this case, the district court  ascertained, also as\r\n\na matter of fact, that the IRS did not have an actual interest in\r                                                \r\n\nthe investigation  of the  taxpayer (the respondents'  law firm),\r\n\nbut only  in learning more about  John Doe.  Thus,  the two cases\r                  \r\n\nare not fair  congeners except  to the extent  that, given  Judge\r\n\nBrody's supportable  factual finding that the  summonses at issue\r\n\nhere were not dual purpose summonses, the Supreme Court's opinion\r\n\nin Tiffany clearly indicates that we should respect that finding.\r                    \r\n\nSee  id. at 322.  And,  once the judge determined  as a matter of\r                  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nproffer in light of the respondents' counter-proffer.\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nfact  that  the  government's   actual  purpose  in  issuing  the\r\n\nsummonses was to further an  investigation of the unnamed client,\r\n\nthe follow-on conclusion that the government should have complied\r\n\nwith  the  procedure  for  issuing  John  Doe  summonses  becomes\r\n\nirresistible.7  See id.\r                                 \r\n\n          We  take  no  pleasure  in  upholding  a  finding  that\r\n\ngovernment actors  constructed a pretext to  avoid due compliance\r\n\nwith statutorily  prescribed requirements.   But the  court below\r\n\ndid not reach  this conclusion lightly and  the record, carefully\r\n\nexamined,  does not  give  rise to  a  firm conviction  that  the\r\n\ncourt's judgment is wide  of the mark.

This nascent contention materialized  out of thin\r\nair; prior  to oral  argument, the  government  had attempted  to\r\njustify the  summons solely as  a means of  investigating whether\r\nthe law firm had reported all the income required to be reported.\r\nSince the  record reveals beyond  hope of contradiction  that the\r\ngovernment's  newly minted contention  was not made  below in any\r\ncoherent  fashion, we  will not  entertain it  here.

In the  court\r\n\nproceeding, the IRS must establish that:\r\n\n               (1)   the   summons   relates   to   the\r\n          investigation  of  a  particular   person  or\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\n          ascertainable group or class of persons,\r\n               (2)  there  is  a reasonable  basis  for\r\n          believing that such person  or group or class\r\n          of  persons may  fail or  may have  failed to\r\n          comply  with any  provision  of any  internal\r\n          revenue law, and\r\n               (3)   the   information  sought   to  be\r\n          obtained from the  examination of the records\r\n          (and the  identity of the  person or  persons\r\n          with respect to  whose liability the  summons\r\n          is  issued)  is  not readily  available  from\r\n          other sources.\r\n\nI.R.C.   7609(f).\r\n\n          This   requirement  of   judicial  preapproval   is  an\r\n\nimportant  component  of the  statutory  scheme;  it permits  the\r\n\ndistrict court to act as a surrogate for the unnamed taxpayer and\r\n\nto  \"exert[] a restraining influence  on the IRS.\"   Tiffany, 469\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 321.  The statutory protections cannot be cavalierly cast\r\n\naside by either the executive or  the judicial branch.  Hence, if\r\n\nthe enforcement  proceeding results  in a determination  that the\r\n\nIRS does not  in fact intend to  investigate a named  party, then\r\n\nthe IRS cannot  obtain the  data it seeks  without observing  the\r\n\nmandate of section 7609(f).  See id. at 322.\r                                              \r\n\n          So  it is here.  The court below supportably found that\r\n\nthe  IRS  had  no  intention  of  investigating  the  tax-related\r\n\nliability  of  the respondents'  law  firm.   Therefore,  the IRS\r\n\ncannot obtain the  identity of the anonymous client    John Doe  \r\n\nby means of these summonses unless and until it  runs the section\r\n\n7609(f)  gauntlet.   To  hold  otherwise would  be  tantamount to\r\n\nassuming  either that section 7609(f) is nugatory or that the IRS\r\n\nwill  always  be able  to fulfill  the  statute's demands.   Such\r\n\nassumptions have  no basis  in  law or  in fact.    The John  Doe\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nsummons procedures  represent a basic legislative  judgment about\r\n\nthe  importance of  taxpayers'  privacy and  other  rights    and\r\n\ncourts must respect that judgment.\r\n\n          To  be  sure, the  harmless  error  argument derives  a\r\n\nsuperficial measure of credibility from Ritchie, a  case in which\r                                                         \r\n\nthe  Sixth Circuit held that,  despite a finding  of pretext, the\r\n\nIRS did  not have  to go  back through the  protocol mandated  by\r\n\nI.R.C.    7609(f).  See  Ritchie, 15  F.3d at 600.   The  Ritchie\r                                                                           \r\n\ncourt  thought that \"it would  exalt form over  substance to make\r\n\nthe IRS go through the motions\" required by section 7609(f), only\r\n\n\"to  bring us back  to where we are  now.\"  Id.  at 600.  Passing\r                                                         \r\n\nover the court's somewhat casual view of the protections afforded\r\n\nby the John Doe  summons procedures,8 and without ruling  out any\r\n\npossibility of  harmless  error in  this context,  we think  that\r\n\nunder section 7609(f) form  is substance, and that the  procedure\r                                        \r\n\nmandated by Congress generally must be followed.\r\n\n          In  all  events,  Ritchie  is  plainly distinguishable.\r                                             \r\n\nThere, unlike  here, an  evidentiary hearing  had been  held, the\r\n\nstatutory  protections  had  been  afforded \"in  spirit\"  if  not\r\n\nliterally, and  the record  contained  sufficient information  to\r\n\npersuade  the court that the IRS had met \"the substantive factors\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Ritchie suggests  that the \"statutory  protections are  not\r                       \r\nstrong in any  event.\"  15  F.3d at  600 n.8.   But strength  and\r\nweakness  are  relative  concepts,  and section  7609(f)  is  not\r\ntotally devoid  of muscle.   Among other things,  the requirement\r\nthat the IRS  have a  \"reasonable basis for  believing\" that  the\r\nunidentified  taxpayer may have  violated internal  revenue laws,\r\nI.R.C.     7609(f)(2),  differs significantly  from  the  minimal\r\nshowing the  IRS  must  make  under  Powell  to  obtain  judicial\r                                                     \r\nenforcement of other kinds of summonses.\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nof    7609(f).\"  Ritchie, 15 F.3d  at 600.  We have no comparable\r                                  \r\n\nrecord before us, and  no basis to assume that the IRS ultimately\r\n\nwill pass the  statutory test.   In particular,  among the  other\r\n\nrequirements for  a John  Doe summons,  the IRS must  demonstrate\r\n\nthat it  possesses  a reasonable  basis  for believing  that  the\r\n\nunnamed taxpayer may  have failed  to comply with  the tax  laws.\r\n\nSee I.R.C.    7609(f)(2).    In this  case,  we have  only  Agent\r             \r\n\nAmeno's  conclusory  declaration, directed  on  its  face at  the\r\n\nrespondents  (not at  John  Doe).   If  this were  sufficient  to\r\n\nsatisfy  the  imperatives  of  section   7609(f),  then  judicial\r\n\npreapproval would  become a charade,  and section 7609(f)  a dead\r\n\nletter.9\r\n\n          We need  go  no  further.    Any way  we  look  at  the\r\n\nsituation, the district court's views as to the applicability vel\r                                                                           \r\n\nnon  of the  attorney-client privilege  are not necessary  to the\r             \r\n\nresult.    Consequently,  we have  no  occasion  to consider  the\r\n\ncorrectness of the court's conclusions on those issues.\r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          The district  court's finding that  the summonses  were\r\n\nnot drawn  in connection  with  a probe  of the  law firm's  tax-\r\n\nrelated liability,  but, instead, for the  clandestine purpose of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9We note, too, that the  Sixth Circuit explicitly warned the\r\nIRS  that  it  was issuing  a  \"one-time only\"  free  pass.   See\r                                                                           \r\nRitchie, 15 F.3d at 600 (\"We are not suggesting that  the IRS may\r                 \r\nin  the future  avoid  going  through  the  ex  parte  proceeding\r\nrequired by   7609(f), for now the IRS has fair notice that if it\r\ncannot demonstrate a bona fide interest  in investigating the tax\r\nliability   of  the  party  summoned,  it   must  comply  with   \r\n7609(f).\").   The government cannot  legitimately expect  another\r\nfree pass this time around.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\ninvestigating  the   lawyers'  unnamed   client,  John   Doe,  is\r\n\nsupportable.   This means that the government is legally bound to\r\n\nfollow  the prescribed  procedure  for the  service  of John  Doe\r\n\nsummonses.  See I.R.C.    7609(f).  It has not done  so.  Summons\r                         \r\n\nenforcement  should be denied  for that  reason, and  that reason\r\n\nalone.\r\n\n          We are mindful that restricting our disposition to this\r\n\nnarrow ground leaves larger  issues unresolved, see, e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

This is  especially true when\r\n\nunsettled issues of broad  public concern are afoot.   See Eccles\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Federal  law,  specifically  I.R.C.     6050I  and  its\r\n\nimplementing  regulations, requires  a person  who  receives more\r\n\nthan   $10,000  in  cash  during   a  single  trade  or  business\r\n\ntransaction  to file a form  (IRS Form 8300)  reporting the name,\r\n\naddress,  occupation, and  social security  number of  the payor,\r\n\nalong with the date and nature of the  transaction and the amount\r\n\ninvolved.  See I.R.C.    6050I; 26 C.F.R.    1.6050I-1(e) (1995).\r                        \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nAt  various times in 1991 and 1992, respondents Nancy Gertner and\r\n\nJody  Newman, then  partners in  a Boston  law firm,  filed forms\r\n\nreflecting four  successive payments of  hefty cash  fees to  the\r\n\nfirm by  a single  client.   Each  of the  forms was  essentially\r\n\ncomplete  except for  the name  of the  client.   The respondents\r\n\nadvised the  IRS that they were withholding the client's identity\r\n\non the basis of  ethical obligations, attorney-client  privilege,\r\n\nand specified constitutional protections.\r\n\n          These   filings    sparked   a   lengthy    course   of\r\n\ncorrespondence  between  the  law firm  and  the  IRS.   In  that\r\n\nexchange,  members  of  the  firm attempted  on  at  least  three\r\n\noccasions  to  determine  whether  the  IRS  wanted  the  omitted\r\n\ninformation as part of an investigation focused on the firm or to\r\n\nlearn more  about the unnamed client.   The IRS did  not deign to\r\n\nanswer these inquiries.\r\n\n          The  parties remained  deadlocked  and  the IRS  issued\r\n\nsummonses purporting to direct the respondents to furnish certain\r\n\nrecords  and   testimony  anent  the  client's   identity.    The\r\n\nrespondents declined  to comply.  The government  then brought an\r\n\nenforcement  action  pursuant to  I.R.C.      7402(a) &amp;  7604(a),\r\n\nclaiming that  it wanted the  information in  connection with  an\r\n\ninvestigation  of the  law firm's  tax liability.   On  April 20,\r\n\n1994, after perusing the complaint and the declaration of Revenue\r\n\nAgent Sophia  Ameno, the district court issued an order directing\r\n\nthe respondents to show cause why they should not be compelled to\r\n\nhonor the summonses.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          The   court   permitted   the   client   to   intervene\r\n\npseudonymously.   Thereafter, the respondents and  the intervenor\r\n\nmounted two lines of  defense.  First, they asseverated  that the\r\n\nIRS's  alleged investigation of the  lawyers was merely a pretext\r\n\ndisguising  its real objective   learning more about the client  \r\n\nand that  the government therefore  should be required  to follow\r\n\nthe   statutory   procedure  for   issuing   summonses  affecting\r\n\nunidentified third parties.1   See I.R.C.   7609(f).   Second, in\r                                            \r\n\nconcert with the amici they  insisted that various privileges and\r\n\nprotections allow lawyers to  shield their client's identity from\r\n\nthe reach of  such summonses.   The IRS  joined issue,  asserting\r\n\nthat  it  had  employed   the  appropriate  procedure;  that  the\r\n\nrespondents  had   failed  to  show  either   that  the  supposed\r\n\ninvestigation  of the law  firm was  a sham  or that  an improper\r\n\nmotive  tainted  the summonses;  and,  finally,  that no  special\r\n\nprotection of any kind attached to the desired information.\r\n\n          When the day of  decision dawned, the respondents asked\r\n\nthe  district  court to  take  live  testimony.   The  government\r\n\nopposed the request.  The court eschewed the evidentiary  hearing\r\n\nthat the  respondents sought but nevertheless  refused to enforce\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Such  a  summons is  known  colloquially  as  a \"John  Doe\"\r\nsummons.   The IRS cannot issue  a John Doe summons    defined by\r\nstatute as a  summons \"which  does not identify  the person  with\r\nrespect to whose liability the summons is issued\"   without first\r\nsecuring  court  approval.   I.R.C.    7609(f).   The  reason for\r\nrequiring such approval is obvious:  in the John Doe context, the\r\ncourt in effect \"takes  the place of the affected  taxpayer\" who,\r\nbeing unnamed, cannot  herself be  expected to know  about    let\r\nalone to oppose    the summons even if it  is irregular.

We  are somewhat skeptical  of this approach,\r\n\nespecially   given   the  Supreme   Court's   recent   lesson  on\r\n\npresumptions and burdens of  proof in an analogous setting.

The  Court's  treatment of  presumptions in\r\n\nHicks is  consistent with  the basic  principle, codified  in the\r               \r\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence:\r\n\n          In  all  civil  actions  and  proceedings not\r\n          otherwise provided for by  Act of Congress or\r\n          by these rules, a presumption imposes on  the\r\n          party against whom it  is directed the burden\r\n          of  going forward  with evidence to  rebut or\r\n          meet the presumption,  but does not shift  to\r\n          such party  the burden of proof  in the sense\r\n          of the risk  of nonpersuasion, which  remains\r\n          throughout the  trial upon the party  on whom\r\n          it was originally cast.\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 301.\r\n\n          We  are hard-pressed  to  fathom  why  IRS  enforcement\r\n\nproceedings should diverge from  this principle.  It is  the IRS,\r\n\nnot  the  taxpayer, that  seeks to  invoke  the processes  of the\r\n\ncourt; and, in a  related vein, the court is  instructed to grant\r\n\nthe  requested  relief  only  when \"sufficient  proof  is  made.\"\r\n\nI.R.C.   7604(b).

To\r\n\nmeet  this  burden, the  respondents  argued  that the  summonses\r\n\nshould be  shelved because  the government's professed  purpose  \r\n\nlinking the summonses to an investigation into the law firm's tax\r\n\nliability   was pretextual.\r\n\n          Contrary to the government's dismissive suggestion, the\r\n\nrespondents did  not simply level the charge.

On appeal,  the IRS  rides two\r                 \r\n\nhorses  into the breach.   First, it maintains  that the district\r\n\ncourt  erred  in  stabling   the  summonses  without  holding  an\r\n\nevidentiary  hearing.  Second, it posits that, in all events, the\r\n\ncourt's ultimate finding of pretext,  based on the record  before\r\n\nit, is unsupportable.  Both steeds are lame.\r\n\n          1.

This means, of course, that\r\n\nif  there  are  two  or more  plausible  interpretations  of  the\r\n\nevidence, the district court's choice among them must  hold sway.\r\n\nSee Johnson v. Watts  Regulator Co.,     F.3d    ,      (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1995) [No. 95-1002, slip op. at 22].\r\n\n          Here, no  clear error looms.  The government's case for\r\n\nenforcing the summonses depended  entirely on Agent Ameno's self-\r\n\nserving declaration (which, as we have previously indicated, is a\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nweb   of  unsubstantiated   conclusions).     In  contrast,   the\r\n\nrespondents fashioned a sufficient evidentiary  infrastructure to\r\n\nsupport  an inference that the IRS's sole purpose in pursuing the\r\n\nsummonses  was to  gain  information about  the lawyers'  unnamed\r\n\nclient.   The law  firm's affidavit, if  credited, indicates that\r\n\nthe  IRS had no apparent reason  to suspect it of any tax-related\r\n\nimpropriety.    And,  moreover,  the  IRS's   use  of  a  generic\r\n\naffidavit,  devoid of  particularization, suggests  that the  IRS\r\n\nnever  really suspected  the firm  of any  questionable activity.\r\n\nThe IRS's stonewalling    its unexplained  refusal to answer  the\r\n\nfirm's  repeated inquiries  as to  whether it  was in  fact under\r\n\ninvestigation   points in the same direction.  These facts, taken\r\n\nin  light   of  the  IRS's  self-proclaimed   practice  of  using\r\n\ninformation  gleaned  from  attorneys'  Form 8300  filings  as  a\r\n\nvehicle for investigating clients  who pay counsel fees in  cash,\r\n\nmake the district court's conclusion that  the IRS's interest lay\r\n\nonly in  the  unidentified  client  seem  quite  plausible.    We\r              \r\n\nconclude, therefore,  that notwithstanding any  presumption which\r\n\nmay  have accompanied  the IRS's prima  facie showing,  the court\r\n\nbelow reasonably  could have  found that  a preponderance  of the\r\n\nevidence  favored  the  respondents'  claim  of  pretext.6    See\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6The  government   argues  that  this   finding  is   flatly\r\ninconsistent with the district court's original acceptance of the\r\nAmeno declaration as a sufficient basis for issuing a  show-cause\r\norder.  We do not agree.   The acceptance of the IRS's first-tier\r\nproffer signifies nothing more  than the court's  acknowledgement\r\nthat  the IRS has mustered a prima facie showing for enforcement.\r\nOnce the  respondents met their second-tier  burden of production\r\nand  raised  a legitimate  question  about  the  validity of  the\r\nsummonses, however, the court was free to reevaluate the original\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661747\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Ritchie,</span>  <a href=\"/opinion/661747/united-states-v-robert-w-ritchie-personally-and-in-his-capacity-as-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  at  <span class=\"page\">599</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (\"Although  there  was  evidence  to\r                 \r\n\ncontradict  this view  and the  IRS strenuously  objects to  [the\r\n\ncourt's] finding,  [the] findings are not  clearly erroneous, and\r\n\nwe therefore adopt them.\").\r\n\n          The  government  argues  that  the  decision  in United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Therefore,  the IRS\r\n\ncannot obtain the  identity of the anonymous client    John Doe  \r\n\nby means of these summonses unless and until it  runs the section\r\n\n7609(f)  gauntlet.   To  hold  otherwise would  be  tantamount to\r\n\nassuming  either that section 7609(f) is nugatory or that the IRS\r\n\nwill  always  be able  to fulfill  the  statute's demands.

The John  Doe\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nsummons procedures  represent a basic legislative  judgment about\r\n\nthe  importance of  taxpayers'  privacy and  other  rights    and\r\n\ncourts must respect that judgment.\r\n\n          To  be  sure, the  harmless  error  argument derives  a\r\n\nsuperficial measure of credibility from Ritchie, a  case in which\r                                                         \r\n\nthe  Sixth Circuit held that,  despite a finding  of pretext, the\r\n\nIRS did  not have  to go  back through the  protocol mandated  by\r\n\nI.R.C.    7609(f).
