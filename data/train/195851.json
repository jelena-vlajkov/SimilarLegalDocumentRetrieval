Appellant Lourdes Chaulizant Nieves appeals\r                           \n\nthe order  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the\n\nDistrict of  Puerto Rico affirming the  Secretary's denial of\n\nappellant's application  for disability  benefits.   We  have\n\nreviewed  carefully the record in this case and the briefs of\n\nthe parties.    Essentially  for  the reasons  given  by  the\n\nadministrative law judge [ALJ] in his decision dated November\n\n20,  1991,  and by  the magistrate  judge  in his  report and\n\nrecommendation dated  May 17,  1994, we find  the Secretary's\n\ndecision to be  supported by  substantial evidence.   We  add\n\nonly the following.\n\n     The  only issue  raised by  appellant to  the magistrate\n\njudge's report,  and hence the only  issue properly preserved\n\nfor appeal, Keating v. Secretary  of Health &amp; Human Services,\r                                                                        \n\n848 F.2d 271, 274-75  (1st Cir. 1988), is that  the Secretary\n\nfailed  to develop  fully  the facts  related to  appellant's\n\nclaim of mental retardation and  therefore that a remand  was\n\nappropriate.   See 42  U.S.C.   405(g).   This court  has not\r                              \n\nhesitated to insist that  the Secretary bear a responsibility\n\nfor adequate development of  the record in appropriate cases.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Evangelista  v.  Secretary  of  Health  &amp;  Human\r                                                                         \n\nServices, 826 F.2d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                    \n\n     Among the  factors which  this court has  found increase\n\nthe  Secretary's responsibility  to  develop the  record  are\n\nappellant's  being  unrepresented  at  the  hearing  and  the\r\r\n\npresentation of a claim which \"itself seems on its face to be\n\nsubstantial.\"  See Currier  v. Secretary of Health, Education\r                                                                         \n\n&amp; Welfare, 612 F.2d 594, 598  (1st Cir. 1980).  In this case,\r                     \n\nappellant was  represented by  counsel at the  hearing before\n\nthe ALJ.   Moreover, appellant presented  no medical evidence\n\nof a mental impairment nor did she  or her counsel ever claim\n\nthat a mental impairment had prevented her from being able to\n\nwork.  Finally, neither  appellant nor counsel ever requested\n\nthe ALJ to schedule a consultative examination on appellant's\n\nmental condition.  In  these circumstances, the Secretary was\n\nunder no obligation sua sponte to develop the record.\r                                          \n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
