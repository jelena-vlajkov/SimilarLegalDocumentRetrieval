Jeffrey Springer appeals the\n                              \n\nsentence imposed  after he  pled guilty,  pursuant to  a plea\n\nagreement, to one count of wire fraud, 18  U.S.C.   1343, and\n\none  count of bank fraud,  18 U.S.C.    1344.  Springer makes\n\nthree arguments, none of which was presented to  the district\n\ncourt  in the  first instance:   1)  that the  district court\n\nerred in granting him only  a two-level, rather than a three-\n\nlevel,  acceptance   of  responsibility   reduction  in   his\n\nsentencing  guidelines offense level;  2) that the  court did\n\nnot  adequately consider his  financial circumstances when it\n\nordered him to pay $1,018,347  in restitution; and 3) that he\n\nreceived  ineffective  assistance  of   counsel  because  his\n\nattorney failed  to object to  either the court's  failure to\n\naward  him   a  three-level   reduction  for   acceptance  of\n\nresponsibility or to  the restitution order.   The government\n\nsays  that we  need  not  consider  these  questions  because\n\nSpringer  waived his  right to  appeal  as part  of his  plea\n\nagreement.  Because we discern no plain error in the relevant\n\ndecisions  made by the  district court, see  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nCabrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 84 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 1644 (1994),  we need not address this  issue, and affirm\n\ndefendant's sentence.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                 Acceptance of Responsibility\n                                             \n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          Springer  was sentenced in  May 1993.   Pursuant to\n\nthe November 1992  version of the Guidelines  (the version in\n\neffect  at the  time of his  sentencing), the  district court\n\nlooked to the 1988 version  of the Guidelines (the version in\n\neffect at the time Springer committed his crime) to calculate\n\nSpringer's sentence.   It did this because application of the\n\n1992 version would have resulted in Springer receiving a more\n\nsevere sentence than he could have anticipated at the time of\n\nhis crime, see U.S.S.G.   1B1.11(b)(1) (Nov. 1992) (directing\n              \n\ncourts  to  use Guidelines  in  effect  at  time offense  was\n\ncommitted if Guidelines in effect at time of sentencing would\n\nviolate the Constitution's ex post facto Clause).  As part of\n                                        \n\nthe  calculation of  Springer's sentence,  the  court granted\n\nSpringer the two-level downward  adjustment for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility  available  under  the  1988  version  of  the\n\nGuidelines.  See U.S.S.G.    3E1.1 (Nov. 1988).  Springer now\n                \n\nargues  that the  district  court erred  because  it did  not\n\nconsider granting him a three-level reduction for  acceptance\n\nof responsibility, the maximum adjustment available under the\n\n1992  version of  the  Guidelines.   U.S.S.G.    3E1.1  (Nov.\n\n1992).\n\n          The  district court  correctly looked  to the  1988\n\nGuidelines in  determining the  maximum permissible  downward\n\nadjustment for Springer's acceptance of responsibility.   The\n\n1992 Guidelines  set forth what  has been referred to  as the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n\"one  book\" rule.   See U.S.S.G.    1B1.11(b)(2) (Nov. 1992).\n                       \n\nThis  provision instructs  the district  court  that when  it\n\nlooks to an earlier version  of the Guidelines to calculate a\n\nsentence, it must apply all of the Guidelines in that earlier\n                           \n\nversion.  It  provides that a court  cannot \"apply . .  . one\n\nsection from one edition .  . . and another guideline section\n\nfrom a different edition.\"  Id.\n                               \n\n          There  is no doubt that Springer received a lighter\n\nsentence  under  the  1988  Guidelines  than  he  would  have\n\nreceived  under the 1992  version.  For  Springer's purposes,\n\nthere  was one important difference between the two versions:\n\nunder the  1988  Guidelines,  Springer's  offense  level  was\n\nincreased by nine levels to account for the $1.8 million loss\n\nhe caused,  while under the  1992 Guidelines, that  same loss\n\nwould  have resulted  in a  twelve-level  increase.   Compare\n                                                             \n\nU.S.S.G.     2F1.1(b)(1)(J)  (Nov.  1988)   with  U.S.S.G.   \n                                                \n\n2F1.1(b)(1)(M) (Nov. 1992).  This difference meant that, even\n\nwith   a    three-level   reduction    for   acceptance    of\n\nresponsibility,  Springer's  applicable  guideline sentencing\n\nrange  under the  1992 Guidelines  would have  been 24  to 30\n\nmonths.  Under  the 1988 Guidelines,  however, with the  two-\n\nlevel reduction for  acceptance of responsibility, Springer's\n\nsentencing range was 18 to 24 months.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  Springer was  sentenced to 18  months in prison,  the low\nend of the Guideline.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Springer  advances  three  reasons  why  the  court\n\nshould  not have  applied the  \"one book\"  rule, but  instead\n\nshould  have   given  him  the  benefit  of   both  the  1992\n\nGuidelines'  acceptance of  responsibility provision  and the\n\n1988 Guidelines' smaller increase for amount of loss.  First,\n\nhe says  that the \"one  book\" guideline was not  in effect at\n\nthe time of  his offense and that its  application here would\n\nviolate the ex post facto Clause.   U.S. Const. Art. I,    9.\n                         \n\nThis is simply incorrect.   The ex post facto Clause \"forbids\n                                             \n\nthe  imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment\n\nassigned  by  law when  the  act  to be  punished  occurred.\"\n\nWeaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 28  (1981).  By looking to the\n                \n\n1988  Guidelines,  the  district   court  imposed  the   very\n\npunishment provided for by law at the time Springer committed\n\nthe act for which he was being punished.\n\n          Springer's second argument is no more availing.  He\n\nargues that, by statute, he is entitled to the benefit of the\n\npre-sentence modifications  of the Guidelines.   He construes\n\n18 U.S.C.   3553(a)(4), which directs the sentencing court to\n\n\"consider  . . . the  Guidelines . . .  that are in effect on\n\nthe   date  the   defendant  is   sentenced,\"  as   requiring\n\napplication of the  November 1992 version of  the \"acceptance\n\nof    responsibility\"   provision.       However,    Springer\n\nmisunderstands the  process  by which  the  sentencing  court\n\ncalculated his sentence.  The sentencing court  did apply the\n                                                   \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nNovember  1992 Guidelines.   It was the  1992 Guidelines that\n\ninstructed the court  to look to the  1988 Guidelines because\n\nof ex  post facto  concerns, and it  was the  1992 Guidelines\n                 \n\nthat instructed the court to apply the \"one book\" rule and to\n\nlook  to  the  1988  Guidelines  in  order  to determine  the\n\nappropriate  reduction  for   acceptance  of  responsibility.\n\nThus,  the  sentencing  court  acted  in  accordance  with   \n\n3553(a)(4).   See  also 18  U.S.C.    3553(a)(5)  (Sentencing\n                       \n\ncourt should \"consider . . . any pertinent policy statement .\n\n. . that is in effect on the date defendant is sentenced.\").\n\n          Springer's third argument is that if the \"one book\"\n\nrule applies, he will be treated differently than other  1988\n\noffenders  sentenced   after  the   1992  amendment  to   the\n\nacceptance  of   responsibility  provision  (or,   at  least,\n\ndifferently  than  those  for whom  application  of  the 1992\n\nguidelines  does not create  ex post  facto concerns).   This\n\nargument is  a red  herring.  What  matters is  that Springer\n\nwill be treated the same  as all those convicted of  the same\n                                \n\noffense at  the  same  time,  regardless  of  when  they  are\n\nsentenced.  This is consistent  with the concerns of Congress\n\nand  the Guidelines'  goal of  uniformity.   Cf. 18  U.S.C.  \n                                                \n\n3553(a)(6) (Sentencing court should \"consider  . . . the need\n\nto avoid unwarranted sentence disparities  among defendants .\n\n. . who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\").\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          Accordingly, we do not discern any error, let alone\n\nany plain  error, in  the district  court's failure  to award\n\nSpringer   a   three-level   reduction   for  acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                      Restitution Order\n                                       \n\n          As   a   condition  of   supervised   release,  the\n\nsentencing  court  ordered  Springer  to  pay  restitution of\n\n$1,018,347  to the  bank  from which  Springer had  secured a\n\nconstruction loan  in the  amount of  $1,460,000 (using as  a\n\nbasis  for  his  credit worthiness  fraudulent  personal  tax\n\nreturns).   Springer argues that the sentencing court did not\n\nsufficiently consider  his ability  to pay  restitution.   We\n\ndisagree.\n\n          In  fashioning a  restitution  order, a  court must\n\nconsider \"the  financial  resources  of  the  defendant,  the\n\nfinancial needs  and earning  ability of  the defendant,  and\n\nsuch  other factors  as  the court  deems  appropriate.\"   18\n\nU.S.C.   3664(a).  The  court need not make specific findings\n\nrespecting these  considerations as  long as  \"the record  on\n\nappeal  reveals  that  the judge  made  implicit  findings or\n\notherwise  adequately  evinced  his  consideration  of  the[]\n\nfactors [listed in  18 U.S.C.   3664(a)].\"   United States v.\n                                                          \n\nSavoie, 985 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir. 1993).\n      \n\n          Here,  it   appears  that   the  sentencing   court\n\nsufficiently considered these factors.  Springer says that he\n\nwas a  college  dropout  with  a sporadic  work  history,  no\n\nassets,  and  more  than $900,000  in  liabilities,  and thus\n\nclearly  unable  to  pay  over  $1  million  in  restitution.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nHowever, the  sentencing court  had all  of this  information\n\nbefore it in  the pre-sentence investigation report  (\"PSR\").\n\nMoreover,  it explicitly  adopted the  PSR's  findings.   Cf.\n                                                             \n\nSavoie,  985 F.2d  at 619.   Furthermore,  at the  sentencing\n      \n\nhearing,  the  court  made  the  following  comments  on  the\n\nrestitution order:\n\n               You   have    a   very    large\n               restitution obligation and  the\n               Court -- you  don't really have\n               much assets now.  The Court has\n               no doubt that at some point you\n               probably will.\n\nThis statement by the court does not reflect \"the possibility\n\nof an unforeseen  windfall,\" as Springer suggests.   Instead,\n\nwe construe it  as evincing a firm belief, on the part of the\n\ndistrict court, that Springer eventually will be able to meet\n\nhis obligation.    This is  consistent  with the  many  other\n\nstatements made by the court  to the effect that Springer was\n\na  talented  individual   who  could  be  successful   if  he\n\nredirected his energies to lawful  activities.  In fact, this\n\nsanguine view  of Springer's  future was  the primary  reason\n\ngiven by the court for sentencing Springer at  the low end of\n\nthe Guideline range.\n\n          It  appears  that  the  sentencing  court  had  the\n\nrelevant information before it and considered the appropriate\n\nfactors  in  making  its  restitution  order.    No  more  is\n\nrequired.   Cf. United  States v. Brandon,  17 F.3d  409, 461\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir.)

(June 13, 1994) (No. 93-2001).2\n\n          Accordingly, we find no plain error in the district\n\ncourt's restitution order.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n              Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n                                               \n\n          Springer  argues   that  he   received  ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel because his attorney  did not raise the\n\nissue  of the  court's failure  to  consider the  three-level\n\nreduction for  acceptance of responsibility  and because  his\n\nattorney did  not protest the size of  the restitution order.\n\nBecause Springer was not entitled to a three-level reduction,\n\nhis  attorney cannot  be  blamed for  not raising  the issue.\n\nInsofar as the failure to object to the restitution order may\n\ngive  rise to an  ineffective assistance  claim, we  will, in\n\naccordance with  our usual practice, not entertain it for the\n\nfirst time  on direct appeal.  This is because the claim here\n\nwould require  us  to go  beyond  the sentencing  record  and\n\nconsider such things  as sentencing counsel's strategy.

Sec. 1343, and one count of bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344.  Springer makes three arguments, none of which was presented to the district court in the first instance:  1) that the district court erred in granting him only a two-level, rather than a three-level, acceptance of responsibility reduction in his sentencing guidelines offense level;  2) that the court did not adequately consider his financial circumstances when it ordered him to pay $1,018,347 in restitution;  and 3) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to object to either the court's failure to award him a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility or to the restitution order.  The government says that we need not consider these questions because Springer waived his right to appeal as part of his plea agreement.  Because we discern no plain error in the relevant decisions made by the district court, see  United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 84 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1644, 128 L.Ed.2d 365 (1994), we need not address this issue, and affirm defendant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Springer was sentenced in May 1993.  Pursuant to the November 1992 version of the Guidelines (the version in effect at the time of his sentencing), the district court looked to the 1988 version of the Guidelines (the version in effect at the time Springer committed his crime) to calculate Springer's sentence.  It did this because application of the 1992 version would have resulted in Springer receiving a more severe sentence than he could have anticipated at the time of his crime, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.11(b)(1) (Nov.1992) (directing courts to use Guidelines in effect at time offense was committed if Guidelines in effect at time of sentencing would violate the Constitution's ex post facto Clause).  As part of the calculation of Springer's sentence, the court granted Springer the two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility available under the 1988 version of the Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 (Nov.1988).  Springer now argues that the district court erred because it did not consider granting him a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the maximum adjustment available under the 1992 version of the Guidelines.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 (Nov.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly looked to the 1988 Guidelines in determining the maximum permissible downward adjustment for Springer's acceptance of responsibility.  The 1992 Guidelines set forth what has been referred to as the \"one book\" rule.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.11(b)(2) (Nov.1992).  This provision instructs the district court that when it looks to an earlier version of the Guidelines to calculate a sentence, it must apply all of the Guidelines in that earlier version.  It provides that a court cannot \"apply ... one section from one edition ... and another guideline section from a different edition.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that Springer received a lighter sentence under the 1988 Guidelines than he would have received under the 1992 version.  For Springer's purposes, there was one important difference between the two versions:  under the 1988 Guidelines, Springer's offense level was increased by nine levels to account for the $1.8 million loss he caused, while under the 1992 Guidelines, that same loss would have resulted in a twelve-level increase.  Compare U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1)(J) (Nov.1988) with U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1)(M) (Nov.1992).  This difference meant that, even with a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Springer's applicable guideline sentencing range under the 1992 Guidelines would have been 24 to 30 months.  Under the 1988 Guidelines, however, with the two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Springer's sentencing range was 18 to 24 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Springer advances three reasons why the court should not have applied the \"one book\" rule, but instead should have given him the benefit of both the 1992 Guidelines' acceptance of responsibility provision and the 1988 Guidelines' smaller increase for amount of loss.  First, he says that the \"one book\" guideline was not in effect at the time of his offense and that its application here would violate the ex post facto Clause.  U.S. Const. Art.  I, Sec. 9.  This is simply incorrect.  The ex post facto Clause \"forbids the imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred.\"  Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 28, 101 S.Ct. 960, 963, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981).  By looking to the 1988 Guidelines, the district court imposed the very punishment provided for by law at the time Springer committed the act for which he was being punished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Springer's second argument is no more availing.  He argues that, by statute, he is entitled to the benefit of the pre-sentence modifications of the Guidelines.  He construes 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(4), which directs the sentencing court to \"consider ... the Guidelines ... that are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced,\" as requiring application of the November 1992 version of the \"acceptance of responsibility\" provision.  However, Springer misunderstands the process by which the sentencing court calculated his sentence.  The sentencing court did apply the November 1992 Guidelines.  It was the 1992 Guidelines that instructed the court to look to the 1988 Guidelines because of ex post facto concerns, and it was the 1992 Guidelines that instructed the court to apply the \"one book\" rule and to look to the 1988 Guidelines in order to determine the appropriate reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  Thus, the sentencing court acted in accordance with Sec. 3553(a)(4).  See also 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(5) (Sentencing court should \"consider ... any pertinent policy statement ... that is in effect on the date defendant is sentenced.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Springer's third argument is that if the \"one book\" rule applies, he will be treated differently than other 1988 offenders sentenced after the 1992 amendment to the acceptance of responsibility provision (or, at least, differently than those for whom application of the 1992 guidelines does not create ex post facto concerns).  This argument is a red herring.  What matters is that Springer will be treated the same as all those convicted of the same offense at the same time, regardless of when they are sentenced.  This is consistent with the concerns of Congress and the Guidelines' goal of uniformity.  Cf. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(6) (Sentencing court should \"consider ... the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants ... who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we do not discern any error, let alone any plain error, in the district court's failure to award Springer a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Restitution Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a condition of supervised release, the sentencing court ordered Springer to pay restitution of $1,018,347 to the bank from which Springer had secured a construction loan in the amount of $1,460,000 (using as a basis for his credit worthiness fraudulent personal tax returns).  Springer argues that the sentencing court did not sufficiently consider his ability to pay restitution.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fashioning a restitution order, a court must consider \"the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3664(a).  The court need not make specific findings respecting these considerations as long as \"the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his consideration of the[ ] factors [listed in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3664(a) ].\"  United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, it appears that the sentencing court sufficiently considered these factors.  Springer says that he was a college dropout with a sporadic work history, no assets, and more than $900,000 in liabilities, and thus clearly unable to pay over $1 million in restitution.  However, the sentencing court had all of this information before it in the pre-sentence investigation report (\"PSR\").  Moreover, it explicitly adopted the PSR's findings.  Cf. Savoie, 985 F.2d at 619.   Furthermore, at the sentencing hearing, the court made the following comments on the restitution order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>You have a very large restitution obligation and the Court--you don't really have much assets now.  The Court has no doubt that at some point you probably will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statement by the court does not reflect \"the possibility of an unforeseen windfall,\" as Springer suggests.  Instead, we construe it as evincing a firm belief, on the part of the district court, that Springer eventually will be able to meet his obligation.  This is consistent with the many other statements made by the court to the effect that Springer was a talented individual who could be successful if he redirected his energies to lawful activities.  In fact, this sanguine view of Springer's future was the primary reason given by the court for sentencing Springer at the low end of the Guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the sentencing court had the relevant information before it and considered the appropriate factors in making its restitution order.  No more is required.  Cf. United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 461 (1st Cir.)  ($500,000 restitution order upheld for indigent defendant who had prospect of future inheritance and ability to obtain gainful employment), petition for cert. filed, 63 U.S.L.W. 3001 (June 13, 1994) (No. 93-2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we find no plain error in the district court's restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Springer argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not raise the issue of the court's failure to consider the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and because his attorney did not protest the size of the restitution order.  Because Springer was not entitled to a three-level reduction, his attorney cannot be blamed for not raising the issue.  Insofar as the failure to object to the restitution order may give rise to an ineffective assistance claim, we will, in accordance with our usual practice, not entertain it for the first time on direct appeal.  This is because the claim here would require us to go beyond the sentencing record and consider such things as sentencing counsel's strategy.  See United States v. Beasley, 12 F.3d 280, 285 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm Springer's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Chief Judge Stephen Breyer heard oral argument in this matter but did not participate in the drafting or the issuance of the panel's opinion.

It did this because application of the 1992 version would have resulted in Springer receiving a more severe sentence than he could have anticipated at the time of his crime, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.11(b)(1) (Nov.1992) (directing courts to use Guidelines in effect at time offense was committed if Guidelines in effect at time of sentencing would violate the Constitution's ex post facto Clause).  As part of the calculation of Springer's sentence, the court granted Springer the two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility available under the 1988 version of the Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1 (Nov.1988).  Springer now argues that the district court erred because it did not consider granting him a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the maximum adjustment available under the 1992 version of the Guidelines.

Sec. 3553(a)(6) (Sentencing court should \"consider ... the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants ... who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we do not discern any error, let alone any plain error, in the district court's failure to award Springer a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Restitution Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a condition of supervised release, the sentencing court ordered Springer to pay restitution of $1,018,347 to the bank from which Springer had secured a construction loan in the amount of $1,460,000 (using as a basis for his credit worthiness fraudulent personal tax returns).  Springer argues that the sentencing court did not sufficiently consider his ability to pay restitution.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fashioning a restitution order, a court must consider \"the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3664(a).  The court need not make specific findings respecting these considerations as long as \"the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his consideration of the[ ] factors [listed in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3664(a) ].\"  United States v. Savoie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 618 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, it appears that the sentencing court sufficiently considered these factors.  Springer says that he was a college dropout with a sporadic work history, no assets, and more than $900,000 in liabilities, and thus clearly unable to pay over $1 million in restitution.  However, the sentencing court had all of this information before it in the pre-sentence investigation report (\"PSR\").  Moreover, it explicitly adopted the PSR's findings.  Cf. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Savoie,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> at <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>.   Furthermore, at the sentencing hearing, the court made the following comments on the restitution order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>You have a very large restitution obligation and the Court--you don't really have much assets now.  The Court has no doubt that at some point you probably will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statement by the court does not reflect \"the possibility of an unforeseen windfall,\" as Springer suggests.  Instead, we construe it as evincing a firm belief, on the part of the district court, that Springer eventually will be able to meet his obligation.  This is consistent with the many other statements made by the court to the effect that Springer was a talented individual who could be successful if he redirected his energies to lawful activities.  In fact, this sanguine view of Springer's future was the primary reason given by the court for sentencing Springer at the low end of the Guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the sentencing court had the relevant information before it and considered the appropriate factors in making its restitution order.  No more is required.  Cf. United States v. Brandon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 461 (1st Cir.)  ($500,000 restitution order upheld for indigent defendant who had prospect of future inheritance and ability to obtain gainful employment), petition for cert. filed, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.L.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">3001</span> </span>(June 13, 1994) (No. 93-2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we find no plain error in the district court's restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Springer argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not raise the issue of the court's failure to consider the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and because his attorney did not protest the size of the restitution order.  Because Springer was not entitled to a three-level reduction, his attorney cannot be blamed for not raising the issue.  Insofar as the failure to object to the restitution order may give rise to an ineffective assistance claim, we will, in accordance with our usual practice, not entertain it for the first time on direct appeal.  This is because the claim here would require us to go beyond the sentencing record and consider such things as sentencing counsel's strategy.  See United States v. Beasley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195099\"><a href=\"/opinion/195099/united-states-v-beasley/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 285 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm Springer's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Chief Judge Stephen Breyer heard oral argument in this matter but did not participate in the drafting or the issuance of the panel's opinion.
