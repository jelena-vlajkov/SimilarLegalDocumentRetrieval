Peter M. Cumming appeals pro  se from\r                                                                    \r\n\nthe district court's  dismissal of his motion  to vacate, set\r\n\naside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255.  The\r\n\ngovernment has moved for summary disposition, and Cumming has\r\n\nfiled an  opposition and a  brief.   We grant the  motion and\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n          The present   2255 motion is Cumming's second.  The\r\n\nfirst such motion -- alleging double jeopardy and ineffective\r\n\nassistance  of trial and  appellate counsel --  was dismissed\r\n\nwithout  prejudice because  Cumming's appeal  from conviction\r\n\nwas  pending in  this court.   Before  the direct  appeal was\r\n\ndecided, Cumming filed  this   2255  motion alleging that  18\r\n\nU.S.C.    4111 was unconstitutional  and had deprived  him of\r\n\nequal protection  of the laws.   Cumming also moved  to amend\r\n\nthe second    2255  motion to  assert  a claim  that a  third\r\n\nattorney  involved  in  his  case  had  rendered  ineffective\r\n\nassistance.  Subsequently, Cumming's conviction and  sentence\r\n\nwere affirmed,  United States  v. Cumming,  No. 93-1960  (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. Aug. 9, 1994), and shortly thereafter the district court\r\n\nadopted a  magistrate-judge's recommendation  that (1) the   \r\n\n2255 equal protection  claim be dismissed because  it clearly\r\n\nlacked  merit, and  (2) the  motion to  amend to  add another\r\n\nineffectiveness  of counsel claim be denied because the first\r\n\n   2255  motion  had  been  dismissed  without  prejudice  to\r\r\n\nCumming's  right to  refile  all  his ineffectiveness  claims\r\n\nafter the decision in his direct appeal.\r\n\n          In deciding  Cumming's direct  appeal, we  rejected\r\n\nthe  claim that his  prosecution for unlawful  importation of\r\n\ncontrolled   substances  was   barred   by  double   jeopardy\r\n\nprinciples because of Cumming's British conviction on related\r\n\ncharges.1  We  also decided that Cumming could  not claim any\r\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.    4111 because those  provisions are\r\n\nonly  applicable  to  offenders  transferred from  a  foreign\r\n\ncountry for the  express purpose of completing  the execution\r\n\nof a foreign  sentence in the  United States.   18 U.S.C.    \r\n\n4100(a), 4101(j); United States v. Gambino, 729 F. Supp. 954,\r                                                      \r\n\n968  (S.D.N.Y. 1990),  aff'd, 968  F.2d 227  (2d Cir.  1992).\r                                        \r\n\nCumming,  slip op. at  4.  It is  not disputed that Cumming's\r                   \r\n\nreturn  to the United States  was voluntary, and not pursuant\r\n\nto the above treaty provisions.\r\n\n          As  an  initial  matter  we  note   that  Cumming's\r\n\nappellate brief and answer to the government's motion make no\r\n\nattempt  whatsoever to articulate  an argument in  support of\r\n\nhis equal protection ground, thereby waiving it.  Martinez v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nColon, 54  F.3d 980, 990 (1st Cir. 1995).  Even if we were to\r                 \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In 1992, Cumming was approved for  transfer to the United\r\nStates  to complete  the execution  of  his British  sentence\r\nunder treaty provisions  codified at 18 U.S.C.     4100-4111,\r\nbut declined the transfer.  Cumming was released from British\r\ncustody in February  1993 after serving the  complete foreign\r\nsentence.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\naddress  that  claim,  it  is  clear  that  Cumming's  double\r\n\njeopardy premise has simply been  reworked under the guise of\r\n\nequal protection.  That claim, at bottom, seeks relief from a\r\n\nsentence which Cumming believes constitutes double punishment\r\n\nfor  the  same  offenses.    But,  we  have already  resolved\r\n\nCumming's  double jeopardy argument and issues disposed of on\r\n\ndirect  appeal may  not be  reviewed in  a subsequent    2255\r\n\nproceeding  absent an  intervening  change in  the  law or  a\r\n\nshowing  that manifest injustice would otherwise result.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nSingleton  v. United  States, 26  F.3d  234, 240  (1st Cir.),\r                                        \r\n\ncert. denied,  115 S. Ct.  517 (1994); Campbell  v. Blodgett,\r                                                                        \r\n\n982 F.2d  1321, 1326 (9th  Cir. 1992) (\"A petitioner  may not\r\n\ncreate a different ground merely by alleging different facts,\r\n\nasserting different legal theories,  or couching his argument\r\n\nin different language.\"); see also Reed v. Farley, 114 S. Ct.\r                                                             \r\n\n2291, 2297 (1994).  Nothing  indicates that any exception  to\r\n\nthat rule applies here.\r\n\n          In addition, we find no abuse  of discretion by the\r\n\ndistrict  court in denying  the motion to  amend, but decline\r\n\nthe government's invitation to decide the merits of Cumming's\r\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel  claims.   This court  has\r\n\ngenerally adhered to the view  that such assessments are best\r\n\nmade by the district judge in the first instance.  Knight  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nUnited  States,  37 F.3d  769,  774 (1st  Cir.  1994); United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Since\r                              \r\n\nthe district court has left the door open to Cumming to press\r\n\nhis ineffectiveness claims, Cumming has the option to file  a\r\n\n  2255 motion strictly limited  to those claims without being\r\n\nsubjected to dismissal for abuse of the writ.

Martinez v. Colon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696203\"><a href=\"/opinion/696203/wilfredo-martinez-aka-wilfredo-martinez-rodriguez-v-rafael-colon-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 990 (1st Cir.1995).  Even if we were to address that claim, it is clear that Cumming's double jeopardy premise has simply been reworked under the guise of equal protection.  That claim, at bottom, seeks relief from a sentence which Cumming believes constitutes double punishment for the same offenses.  But, we have already resolved Cumming's double jeopardy argument and issues disposed of on direct appeal may not be reviewed in a subsequent Sec. 2255 proceeding absent an intervening change in the law or a showing that manifest injustice would otherwise result.  See Singleton v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></span>, 240 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This court has generally adhered to the view that such assessments are best made by the district judge in the first instance.  Knight v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195690\"><a href=\"/opinion/195690/knight-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">769</span></a></span>, 774 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v.

Since the district court has left the door open to Cumming to press his ineffectiveness claims, Cumming has the option to file a Sec. 2255 motion strictly limited to those claims without being subjected to dismissal for abuse of the writ.  Cf. Rule 9(b), Rules Governing Sec. 2255 Proceedings (successive motions may be dismissed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 1992, Cumming was approved for transfer to the United States to complete the execution of his British sentence under treaty provisions codified at 18 U.S.C.
