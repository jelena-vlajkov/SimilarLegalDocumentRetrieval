Petitioner-appellant John J.

Nothing  in  our  November  3, 1992  opinion\r\n\naffirming the  denial of  petitioner's first    2255 petition\r\n\nwas  intended to indicate that an \"abuse of the writ\" defense\r\n\nwould be  unavailable if petitioner filed  a second petition.\r\n\nWe  merely  intended  to  alert the  pro  se  petitioner that\r                                                        \r\n\nalthough the issue he raised for the first time on appeal did\r\n\nnot merit  relief under  our narrowly circumscribed  scope of\r\n\nreview, it could be raised in  a new   2255 petition, subject\r\n\nto any available defenses (including abuse of the writ).\r\n\n          Petitioner's  reliance  upon   Sanders  v.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates,  373 U.S. 1 (1963), is misplaced.  McCleskey v.

We disagree  that this  court's decision  in\r\n\nUnited  States v.  O'Campo, 973  F.2d  1015 (1st  Cir. 1992),\r                                      \r\n\nconstituted   new  law   such  that   the  legal   basis  for\r\n\npetitioner's present claims  was not reasonably available  at\r\n\nthe  time that  his first  petition was  filed.   The O'Campo\r                                                                         \r\n\nholding relied  upon a straightforward  interpretation of the\r\n\nlanguage  of  the   then-current  United  States   Sentencing\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nGuidelines  and  the commentary  thereto.  The  same relevant\r\n\nlanguage  was  contained  in  the  Guidelines  in  effect  in\r\n\nDecember  1991, when  petitioner  filed his  first  petition.\r\n\nTherefore, the language of the Guidelines themselves provided\r\n\na legal basis for petitioner's present claims.\r\n\n          Petitioner  has failed  to  satisfy  his burden  of\r\n\nshowing  cause  for  failing  to  raise  earlier  the  claims\r\n\ncontained in his second    2255 petition.   Nor has he  shown\r\n\nthat a \"fundamental miscarriage  of justice would result from\r\n\na failure to entertain the claim[s].\"  McCleskey v. Zant, 499\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. at 495.  Therefore, we affirm the district court's order\r                                              \r\n\ndismissing  petitioner's second  petition under  28  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2255 as an abuse of the writ.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
